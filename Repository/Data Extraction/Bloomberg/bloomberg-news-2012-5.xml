&lt;p&gt;California-blend gasoline in Los
Angeles weakened for the second day after Chevron Corp. (CVX) reported
a plant startup at the El Segundo refinery in Southern
California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, reported a plant
startup at the 279,000-barrel-a-day El Segundo refinery, a
filing with the California Emergency Management Agency showed.
The company simultaneously reported unplanned flaring related to
a breakdown to the South Coast Air Quality Management District. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend, or Carbob, gasoline in Los Angeles
slipped 0.5 cent to 27.5 cents a gallon above futures traded on
the New York Mercantile Exchange, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The premium for the fuel in Los Angeles narrowed 13
cents May 4 on thin trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These are very routine notices and have a very limited
impact if at all on the refinery,&#8221; Rod Spackman, a Chevron
spokesman at the El Segundo refinery, said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;The refinery is very much alive and well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend, or CARB, diesel in Los Angeles rose 0.75
cent to a premium of 10 cents a gallon versus Nymex heating oil
futures. The same fuel in San Francisco dropped 1 cent to 17
cents a gallon above futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Francisco Carbob gained 1 cent to a premium of 39 cents
above gasoline futures. Phillips 66 (PSX-W), Tesoro Corp. (TSO) and Royal
Dutch Shell Plc. (RDSA) are performing maintenance on units at their
Northern California refineries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in Portland, Oregon, a
benchmark price for the U.S. Northwest, rose 1 cent to 37 cents
a gallon above futures. Low-sulfur diesel there was unchanged at
29 cents a gallon over heating oil futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc (BP/) is starting the 234,000-barrel-a-day Cherry Point
refinery in Washington state after shutting the plant in
February to repair equipment damaged by a fire and to perform a
maintenance turnaround. The refinery is expected to resume
operations over the next several days, a person with knowledge
of the situation said today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. urged a federal judge
in Seattle today to rule that Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. (MMI)
unfairly demands as much as $4 billion in annual patent
royalties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said Motorola Mobility failed an obligation to
offer fair licensing terms on some patents. Motorola Mobility
filed suit in the U.S. and Europe to ban Microsoft products,
saying the software maker refuses to pay to use inventions
essential to industry standards for Wi-Fi and video technology.
U.S. District Judge James Robart said he&#8217;ll rule later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The court is well aware it is being used as a pawn in a
global, industrywide business negotiation,&#8221; Robart said,
according to the Seattle Times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ruling for Microsoft may support a similar complaint
against Motorola Mobility at the European Commission, and help
avoid a ban on sales of its products in Germany. Such a decision
could bolster Microsoft&#8217;s arguments in a trade dispute that the
Asia-made Xbox shouldn&#8217;t be barred from the U.S., where it was
the top-selling gaming system last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It could take a lot off the table,&#8221; said Michael
Carrier, a professor at Rutgers Law School in Camden, New
Jersey, who specializes in intellectual property and antitrust
issues. &#8220;It could affect what&#8217;s going on in both the courts and
the agencies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Royalty Dispute &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hearing today centered on whether Motorola Mobility
fulfilled its obligation to make a fair offer to Microsoft for
use of its patents that relate to industry standards. The judge
also is considering if Microsoft lost the right to complain
because it made no counteroffer to letters Motorola Mobility
sent in October 2010 asking for 2.25 percent in royalties on the
retail price of Microsoft products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That rate would equal about $4 billion a year in royalties,
Microsoft contends. Motorola Mobility disputes that figure.
Should he reject Microsoft&#8217;s arguments, a trial is scheduled for
November that would determine the appropriate royalty rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility said in a statement it has established
cross-licensing relationships with more than 50 companies. Not
all of the patents it&#8217;s asserted against Microsoft are related
to industry standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Aggressive Litigation&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft has refused to negotiate and has instead
initiated and continued to pursue an aggressive litigation
strategy aimed at attacking Motorola Mobility and the Android
platform,&#8221; Jennifer Erickson, a company spokeswoman, said in
the statement. &#8220;Regardless of their transparent tactics, we are
focused on resolving this matter in a way that fairly
compensates Motorola Mobility for the use of our valuable IP and
protects the interests of our stakeholders.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ruling for Microsoft may limit Motorola Mobility&#8217;s
ability to strike back in patent-infringement disputes with
Apple Inc. (AAPL) involving phones that run on Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Android
operating system. Google, in offering $12.5 billion to buy
Motorola Mobility, has cited the handset manufacturer&#8217;s history
and trove of patents as a bulwark against litigation meant to
slow the growth of Android. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ITC is scheduled to announce May 18 a final decision in
Microsoft&#8217;s case against Motorola Mobility over Android phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sales Bans &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Apple have pledged not to use standard-
essential patents to block competitors&#8217; products and demanded
that other companies follow suit. They retain the right to seek
import or sales bans on products that infringe patents that
aren&#8217;t part of any industry standard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility and Google, in letters to U.S. and
European regulators, have said they wouldn&#8217;t seek a ban on the
use of standard-essential patents as long as there are licensing
talks under way. In court papers, Motorola Mobility said neither
Microsoft nor Apple will negotiate fairly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robart blocked Motorola Mobility on April 12 from taking
steps to implement a ban on Microsoft products in Germany until
he rules on the contract issue, a decision Motorola Mobility is
appealing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Howard, deputy general counsel for Microsoft, said
the company is pleased that order remains in place and &#8220;we look
forward to seeing Judge Robart&#8217;s decision on today&#8217;s hearing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;European Commission Inquiry &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission is investigating patent-misuse
complaints filed by Microsoft and Apple against Motorola
Mobility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A different judge with the U.S. International Trade
Commission rejected similar arguments Microsoft made in a case
that may result in a ban on imports of the Xbox gaming system.
That case is under consideration by the six-member commission in
Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ITC judge found that Microsoft infringed four Motorola
Mobility patents, while a second trade judge found that Apple
infringed a different Motorola Mobility patent related to 3G
technology. Apple has its own breach-of-contract suit pending
against Motorola Mobility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limiting the power of standard-essential patents may mean
lower royalty payments on them. Mobile-phone chipmaker Qualcomm
Inc. (QCOM), which gets more than a third of its revenue from
licensing, has said the high-profile nature of the fight may
push regulators and courts to make sweeping rules that hurt the
industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Unforseen Circumstances&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also could discourage companies from working together to
ensure products work across platforms, Carrier said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulators or judges &#8220;could set a broad rule that
could really have unforeseen circumstances considering how
fragile a lot of these arrangements are,&#8221; Carrier said.
&#8220;Standard-essential patents should have special obligations,
but those obligations should stem from the rules of the
organization.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of limits on standard-essential patents has
more urgency for Microsoft now that it faces the possibility it
won&#8217;t be able to bring the Xbox into the U.S. from manufacturing
plants in Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility has called Microsoft&#8217;s objections &#8220;a
competitive tool rather than a principled objection.&#8221; Last
year, in a written statement to the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission, Microsoft supported the right to assert standard-
essential patents at the ITC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Competition Concern &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the agency looks upon itself as being in
the position to grant a compulsory license,&#8221; said Tom Scott, a
patent lawyer with Goodwin Procter in Washington, who handles
ITC cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a March 15 letter to the Justice Department and the ITC,
the Senate Judiciary Committee said it was concerned &#8220;that
patent holders may choose to seek an exclusionary order from the
ITC in a manner that would threaten competition, rather than
simply dispute the reasonable terms of the license in court in a
way that would allow continued use by competitors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the largest companies spend millions of dollars in
legal fees, the fight hurts small businesses that may want to
enter the market, said Carl Howe, an analyst with Boston-based
research firm Yankee Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are some broad questions about what the future of
these patents holds,&#8221; Howe said. &#8220;Maybe the idea of having
industry standards has gone by. A patent is no longer something
to promote innovation, but simply a weapon to be used in a court
of law.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. case is Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) v. Motorola Inc.,
10cv1823, U.S. District Court for the District of Washington
(Seattle). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s experimental pill to
treat rheumatoid arthritis, one of the company&#8217;s leading drug
candidates, raised &#8220;serious safety concerns&#8221; in trials, U.S.
regulators said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pill, tofacitinib, carried increased risks of serious
infections and malignancies, in particular a higher chance of
lymphoma, Food and Drug Administration staff wrote. The agency
released the report ahead of a May 9 meeting of FDA medical
advisers who will review tofacitinib&#8217;s benefits and risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease in which the
body attacks itself. It causes deterioration of the joints,
which can make basic tasks such as walking or holding items
painful. The condition is treated with anti-inflammatory pills
like Aspirin, or drugs that attack the disease directly by
modifying the immune system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data the FDA saw also didn&#8217;t show that the pill stopped
the disease from progressing, according to the staff report.
&#8220;This is particularly important in determining the overall
benefit-risk profile of tofacitinib, which is associated with
serious safety concerns.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 1.3 million people in the U.S. had the disease in
2009, according to the National Institutes of Health. Early
detection can help slow or stop its progression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer rose less than 1 percent to $22.45 at the close of
New York trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First New Pill &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If approved, tofacitinib would be the first new pill for
rheumatoid arthritis in a decade, according to Pfizer. It would
be used in patients who have tried and failed on methothrexate
or injections such as Abbott Laboratories&#8217; (ABT) Humira. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, based in New York, is seeking approval for doses of
five and 10 milligrams. The FDA report said that the higher dose
wasn&#8217;t justified, though. The 10 milligram dose &#8220;is not
supported by the design of the Phase 3 studies, controlled data
or pre-determined analyses,&#8221; the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA is scheduled to rule on the pill by August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has said it would first market the drug to patients
who have failed on the injectable treatments called TNF-
inhibitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s where the greatest unmet need exists today,&#8221; Geno Germano, Pfizer&#8217;s president of specialty care, said on a May 1
conference call. In a statement, Pfizer spokeswoman Kristen Neese said the company believed the data showed a &#8220;favorable
benefit/risk profile.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don&#8217;t Respond &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer estimates that 30 percent to 40 percent of
rheumatoid arthritis patients don&#8217;t respond to the TNF-
inhibitors, including Humira, which generated $7.9 billion in
2011, and Amgen Inc. (AMGN)&#8217;s Enbrel, which Pfizer shares some rights
to. Humira and Enbrel were among the top seven best-selling
medicines in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug may generate $1 billion in sales by 2015 if
approved, said Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst with ISI Group in
New York who has a buy rating on the stock. Most of the risk of
a rejection by regulators involves safety, he said in a May 2
webcast with investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tony Butler, an analyst with Barclays in New York, said in
an e-mail today that the FDA&#8217;s negative view of the pill was
&#8220;as expected.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors mostly have priced the drug&#8217;s approval into the
stock, Schoenebaum said. &#8220;We expected a tough AdCom and the
summary and questions reflect the FDA&#8217;s hard look at both tofa&#8217;s
efficacy and safety,&#8221; he said in a note to clients today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see about a 5 percent downside to the stock, maybe $1,
if the thing is completely rejected,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA may take a stricter line on approval than it did
with previous rheumatoid arthritis drugs, Schoenebaum said.
&#8220;Because it&#8217;s not as much of an unmet medical need as it was a
few years ago, the requirements have gone up,&#8221; Schoenebaum
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) lost a motion to
dismiss a suit filed by Syncora Guarantee Inc. accusing Bear
Stearns  Co. of making false and misleading statements
connected with a mortgage-backed securities transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bond insurer sued JPMorgan Securities LLC, formerly
Bear Stearns, in New York state Supreme Court in Manhattan in
June 2011 over the transaction, known as GreenPoint Mortgage
Funding Trust 2007-HE1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan moved to dismiss the complaint, saying that
Syncora already tried to litigate the claims in federal court in
Manhattan. Justice Charles E. Ramos denied the motion, saying
the state law claims being asserted in the suit aren&#8217;t within
the jurisdiction of the federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Syncora, in this case, deserves its day in court against
JPMorgan,&#8221; Ramos wrote in a ruling dated May 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokewoman for JPMorgan, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Syncora Guarantee Inc. v. JPMorgan Securities
LLC, 651566/2011, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. is prepared to grant Chen
Guangcheng a visa &#8220;right away,&#8221; Vice President Joe Biden said,
and American officials are in contact with the legal activist
over his desire to leave China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect the Chinese to stick to that commitment,&#8221;
Biden said in an interview with NBC&#8217;s &#8220;Meet the Press,&#8221; after
China said May 4 that Chen had the right to apply for permission
to study abroad. U.S. embassy officials are in daily contact
with Chen and his wife, a U.S. official said on condition of
anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chen has been invited to be a visiting scholar at New York
University, where his friend and adviser Jerome Cohen is a
professor. His flight from house arrest to the U.S. embassy in
Beijing and efforts to secure a deal over his fate last week
overshadowed two days of annual strategic and economic talks in
the Chinese capital between the world&#8217;s two biggest economies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think his future is in America,&#8221; Biden told &#8220;Meet the
Press&#8221; yesterday. &#8220;The Chinese have told us that if he files
the paper to be able to have a -- be able to go abroad, that
will be granted.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chen told the Washington Post in a telephone interview
yesterday that he doesn&#8217;t expect to go to the U.S. &#8220;very
soon,&#8221; citing health reasons including an intestinal
inflammation. He said he hadn&#8217;t met with U.S. diplomats since
May 4 and that supporters have been barred from seeing him at
the hospital. Chen wasn&#8217;t available today on his mobile phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Study Abroad&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei declined to
comment today when asked if Chen had applied for a passport.
Hong said the U.S. interfered with China&#8217;s internal affairs in
Chen&#8217;s case and should reflect on its actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 4, another Foreign Ministry spokesman, Liu Weimin,
said that if Chen &#8220;wants to study abroad, he can, like any
Chinese citizen, go through proper channels.&#8221; Later that day,
State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the U.S.
expects China to &#8220;expeditiously process his applications.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chen was imprisoned for more than four years after
representing villagers who opposed forced sterilizations and
abortions, and then was held under house arrest until he escaped
in late April. His case attracted the attention of U.S. leaders,
including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who visited
Beijing last week for the annual cabinet-level talks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chen told American diplomats during his week-long stay in
the U.S. embassy that he wanted to remain in China, and he left
the compound for the hospital in a deal worked out with Chinese
leaders. He later said he feared for his wife and children and
wanted to travel outside China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He said &#8216;I don&#8217;t want to leave China, I just don&#8217;t want
to go back to my village,&#8217;&#8221; Biden told NBC News. &#8220;That was
arranged.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After going to the hospital and talking to friends, they
told him &#8220;you want to get out of here,&#8221; Biden said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;And then he came to us and said, &#8216;I want to leave, and I
want to leave with my family,&#8217;&#8221; Biden said. &#8220;And we got to
work.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Avengers,&#8221; which collected a record $207.4 million in
box office sales when it was released last weekend, is leading
to sales of other films featuring the super-hero characters in
the new movie. None of the films appeared on the iTunes charts
before the &#8220;Avengers&#8221; was released into theaters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, climbed 1.1 percent
to $44.30 at the close in New York. The stock has gained 18
percent so far this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
sold $1.5 billion of debt in its second U.S. dollar-denominated
offering this year, as corporate bond yields reach record lows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM priced $900 million of 0.75 percent, three-year notes
at a relative yield of 45 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries, and $600 million of 1.875 percent, seven-
year bonds at a 65 basis-points spread, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February, when IBM last issued dollar-denominated debt,
it obtained a record-low coupon on three-year notes, selling
$1.5 billion of 0.55 percent securities at 42 basis points more
than Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider will use the
proceeds for general corporate purposes, which could include
debt repayments, preferred stock redemptions, possible
acquisitions or expansion, according to a filing dated today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bonds, which are SEC registered, are expected to be
rated Aa3 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, Bloomberg data show.
Barclays Plc, HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase  Co., and Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc managed the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is offering bonds as company borrowing costs have
reached record lows. Investment-grade corporate bond yields fell
to 3.340 percent May 4, the least in data going back to 1986,
according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate
Master Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February, the Armonk, New York-based company also sold
$1 billion of 1.25 percent, five-year bonds, at a 62 basis
points spread, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard Ruzika, the former commodities
chief at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., has died after a stroke
following knee surgery last month. He was 53. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He died yesterday at Stamford Hospital in Connecticut, Joe
Howley, his business partner and family spokesman, said in a
telephone interview. He had been in intensive care since April
22 when a blood clot caused the stroke, three days after surgery
on his left knee at Greenwich Hospital in Connecticut, Howley
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruzika, who signed with the New York Jets in 1981 as a
tight end and then quit during training camp, left Goldman Sachs
in 2011 after almost 30 years with the New York-based bank. He
was planning to start a hedge fund, Dublin Hill Capital in
Greenwich, where he resided, with Howley and Lance Bakrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruzika was a &#8220;terrific people person, quite admired and
affable and very approachable,&#8221; Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman
Sachs (GS)&#8217;s chairman and chief executive officer, said in a
telephone interview. He was also &#8220;very smart and a very, very
good business person and so he ran some of our most complex
businesses.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein said Ruzika was &#8220;the picture of health&#8221; the
last time he saw him shortly before his stroke. &#8220;He looked 10
years younger than the previous time I&#8217;d seen him,&#8221; Blankfein
said. He was &#8220;very healthy and working out and getting set for
something other than what happened,&#8221; Blankfein said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goldman Sachs Career &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruzika joined Goldman Sachs as a silver and gold trader in
1982, the same year that Blankfein began there as a gold
salesman. Ruzika moved up the ranks becoming head of natural gas
trading in 1996 and two years later helped start the bank&#8217;s
electricity business, according to a February 2011 memo to
employees announcing his departure. He was named a partner in
1998 and was picked as global head of commodities in 2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2006 Ruzika was named co-head of global macro trading
before he was picked to run Goldman&#8217;s special situations group
the following year. That group, which invests the firm&#8217;s own
money, generated 9 percent, or $4.1 billion, of companywide
revenue in 2007, according to an internal document. Ruzika was
promoted to the bank&#8217;s management committee in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas K. Montag, who spent 22 years at Goldman Sachs and
is now co-chief operating officer at Bank of America Corp., said
Ruzika was &#8220;everything you would want in a partner.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Mark Ruzika was born on April 16, 1959 in Brooklyn,
New York, and raised in West Hempstead on Long Island. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Football Career &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He played football at Columbia University in Manhattan,
where he was listed at 6-foot-6, 244 pounds his senior year, and
graduated in 1981 with a bachelor&#8217;s degree in economics. After
signing with the Jets of the National Football League, he
decided he no longer wanted to play and left training camp,
according to a New York Times article at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruzika stayed involved with Columbia. Last year the school
said he gave $1 million toward a new sports center at the
school&#8217;s athletics complex. In 2000 he endowed a scholarship
fund. Ruzika also served on the Columbia College Board of
Visitors and received the school&#8217;s John Jay Award for
distinguished professional achievement in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dublin Hill Capital suspended plans to start a hedge fund
after Ruzika suffered the stroke. Dublin Hill had planned to
trade a macro strategy, which seeks to profit from broad
economic trends, with a focus on commodities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruzika is survived by his wife, Ruthanne, two teenage
children and an elder brother. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Al Jazeera English said it was closing
its Beijing bureau after China refused to renew the visa of a
correspondent whose stories included reports on secret jails and
forced abortions in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government also declined to grant approval to replace
the correspondent, Melissa Chan, 31, who had reported from China
since 2007, Al Jazeera said yesterday. The U.S. is
&#8220;disappointed&#8221; by the decision and has raised the issue with
China, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The channel has expressed its disappointment in the
situation and said it is continuing to request a presence in
China,&#8221; Salah Negm, director of news at Al Jazeera English, was
quoted as saying on its website. &#8220;We are committed to our
coverage of China.&#8221; Chan, who is a U.S. citizen, declined to
comment in an e-mail and directed questions to the company&#8217;s
press office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision not to renew Chan&#8217;s visa comes at a sensitive
time for China, which has been roiled by the ouster of Chongqing
party Secretary Bo Xilai in April and legal activist Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s move to seek shelter at the U.S. embassy for almost
a week earlier this month. The government is trying to ensure
stability as it prepares for a once-a-decade leadership
transition later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Open and Free&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei declined to say whether
Chan&#8217;s visa had been revoked, saying only that the government
had dealt with the &#8220;relevant&#8221; journalist in accordance with
the law. In the e-mail she said she left Beijing on Monday
night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We welcome foreign journalists to report objectively in
China,&#8221; Hong said at a briefing yesterday in Beijing. &#8220;The
environment for their reporting activities is very open and
free. At the same time, foreign journalists should abide by
Chinese laws and regulations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Correspondents Club of China said it was
&#8220;appalled&#8221; by the move, which it called an expulsion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign journalists who sought to cover Chen, who is still
staying at a Beijing hospital after he left the embassy, were
summoned for meetings with security officials, who told them
they risked having their visas revoked, according to the FCCC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The English and Arabic channels of Doha, Qatar-based Al
Jazeera gained worldwide attention for broadcasting images of
the Arab Spring in the Middle East early last year. Chinese
leaders deployed hundreds of security officers at the time to
prevent pro-democracy rallies in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Grave Threat&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FCCC, where Chan was secretary for 2011-2012, called
the ministry&#8217;s decision not to renew her visa a &#8220;grave threat
to foreign reporters&#8217; ability to work in China.&#8221; The Foreign
Correspondents&#8217; Club in Hong Kong said objecting to bad news was
&#8220;a flawed and self-defeating response that should have no place
in a strong and modern nation,&#8221; according to a statement on its
website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the FCCC, Chan had been issued short-term
press credentials over the last three months instead of the
typical one-year accreditation. Al Jazeera said she had filed
more than 400 stories during her time in China, including on
human rights, the economy, labor rights and social justice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Committee to Protect Journalists urged China to grant
visas to Al Jazeera English correspondents. The New York-based
organization said that authorities often delay approving visas
or threaten to revoke them as part of &#8220;an overall strategy of
intimidation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The refusal to renew Melissa Chan&#8217;s credentials marks a
real deterioration in China&#8217;s media environment, and sends a
message that international coverage is unwanted,&#8221; the CPJ said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Knight Fellow &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chan will spend part of 2012 and 2013 at Stanford
University, where she has been named a John S. Knight journalism
fellow, according to Stanford&#8217;s website. She will develop an
online toolkit to help reporters protect their computers against
hacking, according to the website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During her time in China, Chan filed reports about people
displaced by Chinese developers, Bo&#8217;s crime crackdown in
Chongqing and allegations of jails where people were held
illegally in Beijing. A March story showed her visiting what she
described as one such jail and included footage of parents who
said their children had been detained in unknown locations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 2011 blog post, Chan described intimidation she and
her sources had been subjected to while reporting in China,
including a time when a van blocked her car&#8217;s path and men
emerged to bang on their windows and demand they stop what they
were doing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You develop a level of paranoia sometimes, engrossed in
the mission of filming enough footage before getting stopped,&#8221;
Chan wrote in the post. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captain America and Iron Man have
analysts who cover Walt Disney Co. (DIS) scrambling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Joyce, a Miller Tabak  Co. analyst, yesterday raised
his fiscal 2012 profit estimates for Burbank, California-based
Disney, which reports second-quarter results today, citing the
record $207.4 million box-office debut of &#8220;Marvel&#8217;s The
Avengers&#8221; in the U.S. and Canada. Martin Pyykkonen, a Wedge
Partners Corp. analyst, Tuna Amobi of Standard  Poor&#8217;s, and
Brett Harriss, with Gabelli  Co., are considering revisions to
profit forecasts for the world&#8217;s largest entertainment company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film&#8217;s performance will dominate Disney&#8217;s earnings call
with analysts after U.S. markets close, even though its initial
impact won&#8217;t be clear until results for the current third
quarter are reported in August. Analysts will focus on how the
company will use the film&#8217;s success to boost sales through
Disney&#8217;s television, theme-park and merchandise arms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m working on those models as we speak,&#8221; Amobi, who is
based in New York, said in an interview. &#8220;There are several
quarters you&#8217;re likely to see affected positively by this.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney is expected to report second-quarter profit of 55
cents a share, the average of 22 analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by
Bloomberg, and an increase from 49 cents a year earlier. The
company has said it may post an operating loss of as much as
$120 million at its film studio after the March science-fiction
flop &#8220;John Carter.&#8221; Disney&#8217;s television networks and theme
parks made up 87 percent of its $8.83 billion in operating
income last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years, New York City has
campaigned to reduce sugary soft drink consumption. Its latest
ads, plastered all over New York&#8217;s subways, compare sugary
drinks with globs of fat and packets of sugar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, beverage makers, including Coca-Cola Co. (KO) and PepsiCo
Inc. (PEP), are squaring off against city health officials with the
industry&#8217;s first-ever subway ad campaign. Industry-sponsored
placards inside train cars tout lower-calorie options and
package sizes as progress against obesity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city&#8217;s anti-soft drink campaign is &#8220;discriminatory and
singles out one product out of an array of foods and beverages,
all of which contribute equally to this very complex issue,&#8221;
said Chris Gindlesperger, a spokesman for the American Beverage
Association. The ABA, the industry&#8217;s chief lobby group, placed
the pro-soft drink ads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beverage makers are trying to reverse seven years of sales
declines in the $74 billion U.S. soft drink industry, which
still generates a bulk of profits. The decline came as some
consumers shunned sugar and artificial sweeteners. The industry
has spent tens of millions of dollars to beat back proposed
sugary beverage taxes in New York state and elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ad campaign is part of a concerted effort by soda
makers to win the public relations struggle against local and
state governments. PepsiCo, Coca-Cola and the American Beverage
Association have spent as much as $70 million on lobbying and
issue ads since the beginning of 2009, according to the Center
for Science in the Public Interest. In that time, at least 30
states proposed aggressive excise taxes on soft drinks, all of
which failed amid industry push back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Subway Ads &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since placing its first subway ads almost three years ago,
New York&#8217;s health department has had the system to itself. The
city&#8217;s new campaign, funded with a $100,000 federal grant,
includes 1,000 placards inside about 20 percent of the system&#8217;s
rail cars, said Sam Miller, a department spokesman. The subway
system carries on average 5.3 million commuters each weekday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city&#8217;s ads, some in Spanish, depict a cloud of sugar
packets spilling its contents, which transform into globs of fat
oozing on beverage containers below the tagline, &#8220;Are you
Pouring on the Pounds?&#8221; One says drinking three 20-ounce sports
drinks or sodas, or three 16-ounce energy drinks, is like
consuming 40 packets of sugar. The ads, to be posted for three
months, warn that extra calories can lead to diabetes and heart
disease. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s experimental pill to
treat rheumatoid arthritis, one of the drugmaker&#8217;s leading
therapy candidates, should be approved by U.S. regulators, an
advisory panel said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, is seeking to sell
the pill, tofacitinib, for patients who don&#8217;t respond to other
rheumatoid arthritis treatments. A panel of advisers to the Food
and Drug Administration recommended in an 8-2 vote today in
Silver Spring, Maryland, that the agency clear the drug for
sale. The FDA isn&#8217;t required to follow the panel&#8217;s advice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tofacitinib is one of three experimental drugs from New
York-based Pfizer that this year will receive an approval
decision or report key data. If cleared for sale, the arthritis
pill may generate $1.5 billion annually by 2020, John Boris, an
analyst with Citigroup Inc. in New York, said in a May 7 note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Pfizer&#8217;s pill has safety concerns, they are similar
to other rheumatoid arthritis drugs on the market, said David
Blumenthal, a professor of medicine at Case Western Reserve
University and a member of the panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is as good as is possible at this stage in the
game,&#8221; Blumenthal said at today&#8217;s panel meeting. Panel members
also said they wanted to see more data on the drug&#8217;s safety
after it was approved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Autoimmune Disease &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease in which the
body attacks itself. It causes swelling and damage in the
joints, which can make basic tasks such as walking or holding
items painful. The condition is treated with anti-inflammatory
pills like aspirin, or drugs that attack the disease directly by
modifying the immune system such as Amgen Inc. (AMGN)&#8217;s Enbrel and
Abbott Laboratories&#8217; (ABT) Humira. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 1.3 million people in the U.S. had the disease in
2009, according to the National Institutes of Health. Early
detection can help slow or stop its progression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer rose 0.1 percent to $22.45 at the close in New York.
Abbott declined 2.2 percent to $61.23 and Amgen fell 1.5 percent
to $69.62. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pfizer appreciated the robust discussion regarding
tofacitinib,&#8221; Kristen Neese, a company spokeswoman, said in an
e-mail after the vote. &#8220;The clinical trial results demonstrated
a favorable benefit-risk profile and support the approval of
tofacitinib. We look forward to continuing our dialogue with the
FDA.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dose Questions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel also voted 7-2 that the pill was safe, and 10-0
that it was effective. Questions will now turn to how broad of
an indication Pfizer can get from the FDA, and whether the
agency will approve the proposed 5-milligram and 10-milligram
doses. The FDA is slated to decide on the drug by Aug. 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panel members said they wanted to see more data on the
drug&#8217;s safety profile, and asked that Pfizer conduct follow-up
studies once the treatment goes on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m a little concerned about the data showing increasing
risks,&#8221; said Lenore Buckley, a panel member and professor at
the Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine in
Richmond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buckley said she was concerned that infections and
malignancies in patients on the drug seemed to be connected to
the length of time they stayed on the medicine. &#8220;The 5-milligram dose looks better, but I&#8217;m not sure it would look
better at five or 10 years,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer argued that both doses were effective and should be
approved. &#8220;The committee feels some concern about the possible
toxicities,&#8221; Buckley said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think anybody on the
committee has spoken out that the 10-milligram dose shouldn&#8217;t be
a possibility.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Staff Report &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a May 7 report, FDA staff said they had &#8220;serious safety
concerns&#8221; about tofacitinib. Rheumatoid arthritis treatments
that affect the immune system can have side effects including
increased infections and cancers. Regulators also consider
whether the medicines increase cardiovascular problems and
kidney toxicity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel also voted 8-2 that the drug didn&#8217;t stop the
progression of the disease, measured by scans of patients&#8217;
joints. Panel members said that was a difficult measure, though,
and one that can&#8217;t always be relied on to assess a treatment&#8217;s
efficacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re going to be setting ourselves up for difficulties
by setting the bar a little bit too high,&#8221; said Leslie
Crofford, chief of rheumatology at the University of Kentucky

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s longest-serving director and compensation committee chairman, James A. Johnson, should be re-elected to the board at the May 24 annual
meeting and the company&#8217;s 2011 compensation plan should be
approved, ISS Proxy Advisory Services USA told shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the absence of immediate concerns, we are not
recommending a vote against Mr. Johnson at this time,&#8221; the
proxy advisory firm wrote in its annual report on New York-based
Goldman Sachs, released today. &#8220;However, we are highlighting
his nomination as a contentious issue and will monitor the vote
results.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruane, Cunniff  Goldfarb Inc., a New York investment firm
that helps oversee $15 billion, including the $5.7 billion
Sequoia Fund Inc. (SEQUX), has publicly opposed Johnson&#8217;s re-election to
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s board this year. The company, whose co-founder
was a friend of billionaire Warren Buffett, criticized Johnson&#8217;s
role in &#8220;egregious corporate governance debacles&#8221; in an April
18 letter posted on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs board recommended that shareholders re-elect Johnson, who was approved last year with 95.5 percent of
the vote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He has served them well since 1999 and will continue to
do so,&#8221; David Wells, a company spokesman, said in an e-mailed
statement on April 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s executive-compensation plan was endorsed
this year by ISS, which advised shareholders to vote against the
company&#8217;s pay package a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Reasonably Aligned&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm awarded Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein $12.4 million for his 2011 performance, a 35
percent cut from a year earlier as profit and the stock price
fell. The package includes a $3 million cash bonus, $7 million
in restricted stock and a $2 million salary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;CEO pay and performance appear to be reasonably aligned
on a long-term basis at this time,&#8221; ISS said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The percentage of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s shareholders who cast
non-binding ballots in favor of the company&#8217;s compensation plan
fell to 73 percent last year from 96 percent a year earlier. The
board almost doubled Blankfein&#8217;s pay for 2010 even as profit
declined and the stock price was little changed. ISS, in its
opposition to the plan, cited a &#8220;pay-for-performance
disconnect.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compensation plan at Citigroup Inc. (C), the third-biggest
U.S. bank by assets, was rejected by most of the lender&#8217;s
shareholders at the company&#8217;s annual meeting last month. The
board and senior management will &#8220;consult with representative
shareholders to understand their concerns,&#8221; New York-based
Citigroup said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cumulative Voting &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, fell
46 percent last year in New York trading as profit dropped 47
percent, the worst performance since 2008. The company&#8217;s
compensation committee, which decides how much to pay top
executives, has been led by Johnson as long as Goldman Sachs has
been a public company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We engaged with many of our shareholders in advance of
and following our 2011 annual meeting of shareholders in order
to gain further insight and understanding into their views on
our executive-compensation program, particularly as expressed
through the advisory vote,&#8221; the company said in the proxy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISS advised shareholders to vote in favor of two proposals
that Goldman Sachs&#8217;s board has opposed this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would provide shareholders with so-called cumulative
voting, which permits investors to withhold votes from certain
director nominees in order to cast multiple ballots for others.
The other would require the bank&#8217;s named executive officers to
retain at least 75 percent of their stock for at least three
years after leaving the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar proposals failed at last year&#8217;s annual meeting,
with cumulative voting receiving 25.6 percent of the vote and a
proposal requiring stock retention winning 20.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pacific Investment Management Co.&#8217;s
Bill Gross and Jan Hatzius at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) say
investors should prepare for additional bond purchases by the
Federal Reserve to combat a slowing U.S. economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decision to buy more debt is &#8220;getting closer,&#8221; Gross,
who runs Pimco's Total Return Fund, the world&#8217;s largest mutual
fund, wrote on Twitter yesterday. Hatzius, the chief economist
at New York-based Goldman Sachs, predicted in a report the
same day that the Fed will announce additional monetary easing
when it meets in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prospects for a third round of central bank asset
purchases, known as quantitative easing, or QE, increased after
a Labor Department report May 4 showed U.S. employers added
115,000 jobs in April, the smallest gain in six months.
Europe&#8217;s debt crisis is threatening to slow global growth.
Ten-year Treasury yields fell to 1.81 percent yesterday,
approaching the record low of 1.67 percent set Sept. 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In such an uncertain environment, taking out a bit more
insurance still looks like the sensible choice for U.S. monetary
policy makers,&#8221; Hatzius wrote. &#8220;We have stuck with our
forecast of some additional monetary easing&#8221; at the Fed&#8217;s
policy meeting June 19 to June 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bond Purchases &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank bought $2.3 trillion of bonds in two
rounds of quantitative easing, known as QE1 and QE2, from 
December 2008 to June 2011. The Fed is also replacing $400
billion of short-term Treasuries in its holdings with longer-
term debt to keep borrowing costs down, under a program
scheduled to end next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Policy makers have pledged to keep the target for overnight
bank lending as low as zero until at least late 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Fed officials have questioned whether additional easing
will work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed Bank of Dallas President Richard Fisher said yesterday
that a drop in equity prices is no reason for the central bank
to intervene. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Markets are manic depressive, they come and go,&#8221; Fisher
told reporters when asked if slumping markets and slower-than-
expected employment gains had changed his outlook for Fed
policy. &#8220;The key to success here is not further monetary
accommodation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shares Slumping &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index fell to its lowest level in
two months yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker said May 7
that much of U.S. unemployment results from structural
weaknesses such as inadequate training that can&#8217;t be fixed by
Fed stimulus. The U.S. jobless rate of 8.1 percent is the lowest
in three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some commentators are urging the Fed to take additional
action as long as the unemployment rate remains elevated,&#8221;
Lacker said. &#8220;But if elevated unemployment reflects largely
fundamental factors rather than insufficient spending, such
stimulus might have little impact on unemployment and instead
just raise the risk of pushing inflation up.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lacker votes on monetary policy this year while Fisher does
not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. economy is &#8220;dreary,&#8221; Hatzius wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross domestic product slowed to an annual rate of 2.2
percent in the first quarter from 3 percent in the prior three
months, the Commerce Department reported April 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Greece Struggling &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politicians in Greece struggled to form a new government,
raising concern the nation will abandon the euro as its
currency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes yielded 1.82 percent today
as of 8:17 a.m. in London, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader
prices. The average over the past decade is 3.83 percent. The 2
percent security due in February 2022 changed hands at 101
18/32. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low government rates have led investors to look for more
attractive yields outside the sovereign bond market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasuries have returned 0.6 percent this year, eclipsed by
a 4.8 percent rally for an index of U.S. investment grade and
high-yield company debt, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Risk markets need more ammo if they are to stay up,&#8221;
Gross, who is based in Newport Beach, California, wrote on
Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross&#8217; Total Return Fund has returned 4.8 percent this
year, beating 98 percent of its peers, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Pimco is a unit of the Munich-based
insurer Allianz SE. (ALV) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) dropped equity
research coverage of Ingersoll-Rand Plc, saying the bank is now
acting as an adviser to the maker of Trane air conditioners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s advisory role was announced on May 9, according
to a note today from analyst Stephen Tusa, who had an overweight
recommendation on shares of Swords, Ireland-based Ingersoll-
Rand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Misty Zelent, a spokeswoman for Ingersoll-Rand, said in a
telephone interview that the company didn&#8217;t announce JPMorgan as
an adviser and has retained the bank&#8217;s services periodically
over several years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Trian Fund Management LP, the investment
fund of Nelson Peltz, announced it took a 7.3 percent stake in
Ingersoll-Rand and would seek talks with management. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon said the firm lost about $2 billion on 
synthetic credit securities after an &#8220;egregious&#8217;&#8221; failure in its 
chief investment office, which the bank says focuses on hedging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This portfolio has proven to be riskier, more volatile
and less effective as an economic hedge than the firm previously
believed,&#8221; the New York-based company said today in a quarterly
securities filing. JPMorgan declined 5.5 percent to $38.50 in
extended trading at 5:55 p.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chief investment office has been transformed in recent
years under Dimon into a unit that makes bigger and riskier
speculative bets with the bank&#8217;s money, according to five former
employees, Bloomberg News reported April 13. Some bets were so
big that JPMorgan probably couldn&#8217;t unwind them without losing
money or roiling financial markets, the former executives said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News first reported April 5 that London-based
trader Bruno Iksil had amassed positions linked to the financial
health of corporations that were so large he was driving price
moves in the $10 trillion market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Bloomberg report, Dimon on a conference call said
the news coverage was &#8220;a complete tempest in a teapot.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The losses disclosed today were &#8220;a little bit to do with
the article in the press,&#8221; Dimon said, without specifying who
in the bank oversaw the trades. &#8220;I also think we acted a little
bit too defensively&#8221; to the reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Flawed, Complex&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synthetic credit products are derivatives that generate
gains and losses tied to credit performance without the owner
buying or selling actual debt. The losses occurred as the
company sought to unwind a portfolio of the instruments used to
hedge JPMorgan&#8217;s credit exposure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In hindsight, the new strategy was flawed, complex,
poorly reviewed, poorly executed and poorly monitored,&#8221; Dimon
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said the losses were partly offset by gains from
the sales from its available-for-sale credit portfolio,
resulting in a net loss for the firm&#8217;s corporate division, which
includes the CIO, of about $800 million after taxes. The losses
could widen or narrow during the rest of the quarter, Dimon
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank is &#8220;repositioning&#8221; the synthetic credit
portfolio, and the CIO &#8220;may hold certain of its current
synthetic credit positions for the longer term,&#8221; the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon said the bank made egregious mistakes and
that the losses of about $2 billion tied to synthetic credit
securities were &#8220;self-inflicted.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re accountable, and what happened violates
our own standards and principles about how we want to operate
the company,&#8221; Dimon said in a conference call today. &#8220;This is
not how we want to run a business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank fell 6.2 percent to $38.20 at 5:26 p.m. in
extended trading in New York after disclosing the losses at its
chief investment office. Dimon said the New York-based lender
made the trades to guard against credit risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In re-hedging the portfolio, it was a bad strategy, badly
executed and poorly monitored,&#8221; Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon told analysts they should assume his bank keeps
regulators informed about its finances and that the trades may
not run afoul of the so-called Volcker rule, which seeks to
limit banks&#8217; bets with their own funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We do believe you need to have the ability to hedge in a
CIO-type position, and that Volcker allows that,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;This trading may not violate the Volcker rule, but it violates
the Dimon principle.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon said that while the changes in prices contributed to
the losses, he didn&#8217;t want to cite what he called the excuse of
&#8220;market dislocation&#8221; and he said other banks may have been
spared losses from the disruption. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Citigroup
Inc. (C) and Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF) plan to sell $1.5 billion of
commercial mortgage-backed securities as soon as next week,
according to people familiar with the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal contains 79 loans tied to 175 properties across
the U.S., said the people, who asked not to be identified
because terms aren&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street has arranged about $5 billion of the debt this
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales are picking
up after slowing in the fourth quarter as market volatility
crimped new lending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank projections for commercial-mortgage bond deals in 2012
range from Wells Fargo  Co.&#8217;s $25 billion to Credit Suisse
Group AG&#8217;s projection of as much as $45 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commercial-mortgage bond values slid last month when the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York said it was considering selling
assets from its Maiden Lane III portfolio on concern there
wouldn&#8217;t be enough buyers. The district bank sold $7.5 billion
of collateralized debt obligations tied to commercial real
estate to Barclays Plc and Deutsche Bank AG on April 26 after a
bidding war erupted for the securities. UBS AG yesterday sold
$1.5 billion of similar securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices on a commonly cited measure of demand for lower-
rated commercial-mortgage bonds fell to 59.8 cents on the dollar
on April 10, according to data from Markit Group Ltd. Prices
have since rebounded to 61.9 cents, still down from the 2012
high of 72 cents in January. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Nov.&#160;7, something went wrong at
a deep-sea oil well operated by Chevron Corp. (CVX) 230 miles (370
kilometers) northeast of Rio de Janeiro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a massive drill bit punctured reservoir N560, roughly
3,500&#160;feet beneath the ocean floor, monitors revealed pressure
much higher than technicians expected. The next day a routine
flyover of the field, called Frade, in the Campos Basin,
revealed oil on the water&#8217;s surface. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron dispatched remote-controlled submarines, which
found oil seeping through fissures on the sea floor directly
above N560. The blowout preventer, a three-story-tall valve
assembly, automatically cut off oil flow at the wellhead. This
would not become another BP Plc disaster, in which the blowout
preventer notoriously failed, Bloomberg Businessweek reported in
its May 14 issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, George Buck, president of Chevron&#8217;s Brazil
subsidiary, ordered the Frade well shut down. Chevron sent 18
vessels in rotation to contain the oil on the surface, and it
readied pyramid-shaped steel caps to cover the seepage points.
Workers completed the job in just four days. Buck saw the
situation as under control. And technically, it was. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A petroleum engineer in his mid-forties, Buck has an MBA
and has worked for Chevron for 23&#160;years. He is 6-foot-5,
slender, soft-spoken, and earnest to the point of social
awkwardness. He arrived in Brazil in 2009, having worked from
Alaska to Texas to Indonesia. He lives with his family in Rio&#8217;s
fashionable Ipanema beach district. He is not a man about town. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After three years in Brazil, Buck speaks little Portuguese,
relying heavily on translators. Nevertheless, on the Frade
spill, Buck thought he had made himself quite clear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;`Full Responsibility&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron takes full responsibility for this incident,&#8221; he
said at a press conference in Rio on Nov.&#160;21. At a congressional
hearing in Bras&#237;lia two days later, he added, &#8220;Sincere
apologies to the Brazilian people and the Brazilian
government.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian politicians and journalists were not placated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re going to show this gang that they can&#8217;t come down
here and create whatever environmental mess they want,&#8221; Carlos
Minc, a co-founder of Brazil&#8217;s Green Party and environmental
secretary of Rio state, told the newspaper O Globo. &#8220;I want to
see the CEO of Chevron swim in that oil.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local Greenpeace activists doused the door of Chevron&#8217;s Rio
office with black ink. &#8220;Chevron: your mess, our loss,&#8221; read
one protester&#8217;s placard. &#8220;There is no doubt that an offense
occurred,&#8221; declared Fabio Scliar, chief of the Brazilian
federal police department&#8217;s environmental division. &#8220;What
interests me now is determining the responsibilities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Environmental Lawsuit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, Eduardo Santos de Oliveira, a Brazilian
federal prosecutor, answered the police investigator&#8217;s question
when he sued Chevron for the equivalent of $11&#160;billion for
alleged environmental damage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twelve weeks later a Brazilian navy plane spotted a second
oil sheen above a different section of Frade, and on Mar.&#160;21,
Oliveira filed criminal charges against Buck and 16 other
employees of Chevron and its main drilling contractor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contractor, Transocean Ltd. (RIG), had operated the Deepwater
Horizon rig that exploded in the Gulf of Mexico in April&#160;2010,
killing 11 men and spewing 4.9&#160;million barrels of oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Frade spill, by contrast, was capped at 2,400 barrels,
according to Chevron. There were no injuries at Frade, no
contaminated fisheries, no dead turtles, and no oil on shore --
the slick moved out to sea and broke up swiftly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, a judge acting at Oliveira&#8217;s request ordered the
Chevron and Transocean defendants not to leave Brazil and had
their passports confiscated. The accused, mostly veteran
expatriates, include six Americans, as well as citizens of
France, Australia, Canada and the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;`Contamination Bomb&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron and Transocean have caused a contamination bomb
with a prolonged effect,&#8221; Oliveira said, as he filed charges
against the 17. An outspoken career prosecutor who under
Brazilian law enjoys tenure in his influential civil service
position, he alleged &#8220;crimes against the environment&#8221; --
namely, that the defendants knew they were drilling in a high-pressure reservoir, recklessly proceeded anyway and caused
severe ecological harm. Oliveira has said that if convicted, the
defendants could face prison terms as long as 20 or 30&#160;years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kurt Glaubitz, a Chevron spokesman based at company
headquarters in San Ramon, California, calls the charges
&#8220;outrageous and without merit.&#8221; Chevron, he said, &#8220;will
vigorously defend the company and its employees.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transocean likewise says that neither it nor its workers
did anything wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sued Again &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet Oliveira wasn&#8217;t done. In early April he sued again,
escalating his total damages claim to $22 billion. A company
that tried to respond responsibly to a regrettable but
noncatastrophic accident was blindsided, says Rafael Jaen
Williamson, who handles public affairs for Chevron in Latin
America. &#8220;There was among our guys a puzzlement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all its global reach and technological sophistication,
the second-largest U.S. energy company after Exxon Mobil Corp.
in market capitalization didn&#8217;t have an effective plan for a
sudden and multifront assault that included populist protest,
political posturing, and criminal prosecution for -- in
Chevron&#8217;s view -- cleaning up after itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the blame rests with Chevron&#8217;s top executives in
Brazil. The company represented itself in a critical foreign
market with a surprisingly provincial American face. Buck, by
all accounts a talented and exacting internal corporate leader,
is not the statesman Chevron needed to explain the Frade
accident to Brazil&#8217;s media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bungled Public Relations &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was more to the crisis, though, than bungled public
relations. Chevron got caught up in Brazilian political
crosscurrents having little in particular to do with the U.S.
company but revealing much about the delicate state of Brazil&#8217;s
burgeoning oil industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They were the wrong company in the wrong place at the
wrong time,&#8221; says Denis Palluat de Besset, managing director of
the Brazilian unit of the French oil company Total. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a coffee break at an industry conference at an
oceanside Rio resort, Besset says he sympathizes with his U.S.
rivals. &#8220;In Brazil,&#8221; he adds, &#8220;this could happen to any of us
at this moment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frade (pronounced FRA-dje) refers to a fish found off the
Brazilian coast. The project became Chevron&#8217;s when it bought
Texaco Inc. in 2001. Chevron operates the $3.6&#160;billion venture
and owns 51.7&#160;percent of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Frade Partners &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4), or Petrobr&#225;s, the Brazilian state
oil company, owns 30&#160;percent; a Japanese consortium, the
remaining 18.3&#160;percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frade produced its first oil in 2009; until its recent
troubles, it generated 79,000&#160;barrels a day from 11&#160;wells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mysteriously elevated pressure encountered in reservoir
N560 in November occurred in an &#8220;appraisal&#8221; well, which is one
still being explored and not yet producing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How Chevron made this mistake--misjudging the conditions in
an undersea oil pool--has not yet been determined. The company
says it&#8217;s studying the incident, as are Brazilian regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether these investigations find negligence,
the Frade episode demonstrates once again that deep-water
drilling is a risky enterprise. Ph.D.s aren&#8217;t omniscient; their
computer models aren&#8217;t flawless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unanticipated pressure led to a surge of petroleum that
cracked the well bore, allowing oil to escape upward toward the
ocean floor in tiny rivulets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Remain Mum &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the initial four days after discovering the accident,
Chevron had almost nothing to say in public in Brazil.
Executives at the company&#8217;s collegiate San Ramon, California,
campus instructed Buck to focus on the leaking oil and remain
mum until he and his colleagues had a sense of what had
happened. The Brazilian media took immediate and disapproving
note of Chevron&#8217;s lack of disclosure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Buck finally emerged to make a series of public
appearances, he delivered lengthy engineering and geology
lectures in English to reporters who don&#8217;t speak his language.
At times, he was visibly flustered when journalists shouted
questions in Portuguese. He admitted to colleagues he was out of
his depth. &#8220;I&#8217;m just a driller,&#8221; he said privately after one
heated encounter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We didn&#8217;t necessarily put our best foot forward in some
of the communication,&#8221; Chevron Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer John Watson conceded during a conference call with U.S.
securities analysts on Jan.&#160;27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ecuador Comparison &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor did the company seem to appreciate that it has a
tainted reputation among environmental activists throughout
Latin America because of an unrelated case in Ecuador. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February&#160;2011 an Ecuadorian judge imposed an $18.2
billion contamination judgment on Chevron concerning past
activities of Texaco in the Amazon rainforest. Chevron has lost
an initial appeal in Ecuador and is continuing to fight the
enormous verdict, alleging it was the product of fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to one Brazilian oil industry lawyer, the
Ecuadorian case has been &#8220;inspirational&#8221; to activists
elsewhere in the region who dream of winning their own
multibillion-dollar victory against a multinational. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buck, for one, still seems baffled. Chevron&#8217;s lawyers won&#8217;t
let him sit for a formal interview, but he amiably agrees to a
handshake and brief chat in his spotless corner office. He&#8217;s
trying to go about his usual business in Rio, but it&#8217;s clearly
no fun living under a cloud of official condemnation. &#8220;When you
figure out what happened here,&#8221; he says, &#8220;please let me
know.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chevron&#8217;s Antagonists &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s antagonists in Brazil gained real momentum in
March, after the second seepage created the impression that the
company&#8217;s Frade operations were out of control. Yet, the
incident in March may turn out to be nothing at all. According
to Chevron, the event generated a surface sheen of only a single
barrel, and occurred three kilometers away from the November
spill, above a separate reservoir that had not been drilled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The November and March incidents, the company says, seem to
have been unrelated. The much smaller amount of rogue oil
discovered in March was more degraded, suggesting it had been in
the water longer. It also lacked any trace of drilling mud, a
heavy industrial fluid used in appraisal and production. The
March mini-sheen, in other words, may have been entirely
natural; searching for natural seepage is part of the oil-prospecting business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Frade Shut-Down &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the same, Chevron voluntarily shut down the entire
Frade field -- the largest such moratorium in the company&#8217;s
history -- to allow geologists to determine why they failed to
anticipate the high pressure in reservoir N560. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron &#8220;has coordinated with Brazilian authorities at all
stages and will continue to work with them until the incidents
are fully resolved,&#8221; it says on its website. The company has
exchanged voluminous information with Brazilian environmental
and oil-industry regulators, and those agencies have announced
likely fines on the order of tens of millions of dollars (a
prospect that surprises no one involved). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, though, it appears unlikely that penalties of this
scale will satisfy Chevron critics such as Minc and Oliveira, no
matter how hard the company tries to resolve the overblown
scandal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Brazil&#8217;s first oil spill controversy following the 2010
Gulf of Mexico disaster, Frade has raised questions about
whether the country would back away from deep-sea exploration or
distance itself from foreign producers. At a March&#160;13 meeting
with securities analysts, Chevron&#8217;s Watson said the company
wants to be &#8220;a player in Brazil for a long time.&#8221; He hedged,
though, adding, &#8220;it remains to be seen.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Offshore Commitment &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Rio, S&#227;o Paulo, and Bras&#237;lia, though, there is no
indication that the nation&#8217;s leadership or the majority of its
citizens are rethinking their commitment to offshore oil or to
some involvement of foreign energy companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil is not Argentina -- where last month the government
expropriated the Spanish company Repsol YPF SA (REP)&#8217;s stake in the
petroleum producer YPF -- let alone Venezuela under the virulent
anti-American rule of Hugo Ch&#225;vez. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with Chevron and Total, Royal Dutch Shell Plc,
Statoil ASA, and BP are all present in Brazil. With more than
800&#160;employees in the country, 90&#160;percent of them locals, Chevron
has the most substantial presence of any of the foreigners. The
very scale of Brazil&#8217;s hydrocarbon supply, along with a
spreading anxiety about the country&#8217;s ability to exploit the
resource safely and efficiently, helps explain Chevron&#8217;s
situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8217;Presalt&#8217; Bonanza &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, Brazilian geologists made the biggest oil find in
the Americas in three decades. Five miles below sea level, and
beneath a shifting layer of cretaceous salt deposits, the
discoveries have been estimated at 50&#160;billion to 100&#160;billion
barrels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These &#8220;presalt&#8221; oil beds are spread over an area the size
of New York State. Frade is not a presalt field, although it&#8217;s
close to the 2007 find. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already a commodity titan -- the world&#8217;s biggest exporter
of beef, coffee, sugar, and orange juice -- Brazil suddenly had
the potential to become a global leader in energy as well. Then-president Luiz In&#225;cio Lula da Silva declared that the presalt
opportunity demonstrated that &#8220;God is Brazilian.&#8221; His
successor, Dilma Rousseff, a former energy minister who was
chairman of Petrobr&#225;s for seven years during Lula&#8217;s
administration, has called the reserves her nation&#8217;s &#8220;passport
to the future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8217;Illusion of Limitless Resources&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norman Gall, executive director of the Fernand Braudel
Institute of World Economics, a corporate-funded think tank in
S&#227;o Paulo, worries that oil-fueled euphoria has bred in the
Brazilian political class &#8220;the illusion of limitless resources
on the horizon.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gall points to a Lula cabinet statement issued after the
2007 discoveries that described the presalt fields as promising
&#8220;extremely low exploration risks and great profitability.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This notion of easy prosperity propelled enactment of
nationalistic legislation requiring Petrobr&#225;s to be the sole
operator of all &#8220;strategic&#8221; presalt reservoirs and to own at
least 30&#160;percent of the projects. In a prescient 2011 paper,
Gall warned that these obligations will &#8220;strain Petrobr&#225;s&#8217;s
already stretched manpower, financial, and technical
capacities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before it begins to produce much oil from the presalt
fields, Petrobr&#225;s is struggling to keep pace with its own
ambitious plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;$225 Billion Expansion &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year it announced a five-year, $225&#160;billion expansion
program. Yet 2011 marked the first year in eight that Petrobr&#225;s
slowed capital expenditures, laying out 5.1&#160;percent less than it
did in 2010. Operating under strict local procurement rules, it
has had difficulty acquiring sufficient Brazilian-made vessels,
pipelines, and drilling gear. Its costs are rising faster than
predicted, and its refineries are overextended. In the fourth
quarter of 2011 these problems contributed to a 52&#160;percent drop
in net income, to $2.9&#160;billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock market has signaled concern: Petrobr&#225;s shares
traded publicly in New York have declined by a third over the
past year, to less than $22&#160;apiece. Rather than grapple with the
tremendous operational challenges accompanying accelerated oil
development, many Brazilian politicians are distracted by how to
divide up the anticipated profits, Gall says. &#8220;They&#8217;re not
focused at all on the operations of the oil industry or whether
the industry is trying to do too much too quickly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduce Royalties? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brazilian Congress is considering legislation that
would reduce future royalties flowing to coastal oil-producing
states and redistribute the money among all 26 Brazilian states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the proposed law, the states of Rio de Janeiro and
Espirito Santo could lose billions of dollars a year. Rio
state&#8217;s governor has threatened a court challenge if the bill is
enacted. Not long after the Brazilian Senate approved the
royalty redistribution plan in mid-October, 150,000 people
marched in protest through the streets of Rio de Janeiro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was amid this turmoil and uncertainty that the accident
in the Frade field occurred. In Brazil, Gall argues, &#8220;there is
a tendency to project out, to push the blame out, as a way not
to think about difficult problems, like whether we have thought
through carefully all the risks of presalt.&#8221; Chevron made
itself an easy target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an official known for public vehemence, Oliveira comes
across in an interview at the Federal Prosecutors&#8217; Office in Rio
as open, friendly, and eager to explain himself. He brings with
him a pair of public-relations aides and a junior lawyer. In
every case, he says, he follows the facts wherever they take
him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oliveira on Oliveira &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My professional career, since 1984, has always been
through competitive selection,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I never got a job
through political decisions.&#8221; Although based in the city of
Campos in the state of Rio, he says he has no interest in the
debate about distribution of oil royalties. He also points out
that he helped investigate a notorious incident in 2001, when a
Petrobr&#225;s offshore platform called P-36 exploded as a result of
equipment failure, killing 11 workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oliveira says he&#8217;s not grandstanding by threatening foreign
oil workers with prison. Criminal behavior demands stern
punishment, he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is no nationalism or xenophobia.&#8221; As for his
demand for tens of billions of dollars in damages, he points out
that &#8220;Chevron has every right to dispute this figure, to try to
adjust the size.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chevron Refutes &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, he has stressed the scope of ecological damage;
in the interview, he focuses on the &#8220;incalculable&#8221; structural
damage he alleges that Chevron caused the Frade field. &#8220;Our
concern is that the geology of the field has been compromised.&#8221;
Chevron says this isn&#8217;t so and that it intends to resume
exploration and production in Frade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without prompting, the prosecutor announces what seems like
big news: He plans to add another major U.S. company as a
defendant in his multibillion-dollar suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halliburton Co. (HAL), the oil services company, he claims,
failed to use sufficient steel piping and cement in doing what&#8217;s
known as completion work on the well that leaked. Asked about
this allegation, a Chevron spokesman says it&#8217;s incorrect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Halliburton did help finalize construction of other
wells at Frade, the well was plugged before Halliburton&#8217;s
services were needed, according to Chevron. A Halliburton
spokeswoman likewise says the company wasn&#8217;t involved in the
completion work at the well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shoot From Hip? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Queried the next day, Oliveira says he saw Halliburton&#8217;s
name in a police investigative report on the Frade accident. He
is continuing to study the contractor&#8217;s exact role. His shoot-from-the-hip style, however, leaves Oliveira&#8217;s intentions toward
Halliburton unclear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Brazilian politics and business are not easy to
understand from the outside,&#8221; says Luis Octavio da Motta Veiga.
A lawyer for oil, mining, and banking interests, Motta Veiga
formerly headed the Brazilian equivalent of the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission. Twenty-two years ago he served briefly
as chairman of Petrobr&#225;s. While he has no direct involvement in
the Frade matter, he contends that Brazilian attitudes toward
environmental threats vary according to the alleged violator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Petrobr&#225;s owns 30&#160;percent of Frade [and] has had eight
small spills in the past year, and I have heard nothing about it
in terms of protest,&#8221; the attorney notes. &#8220;It is easier to
complain about the foreigners rather than Petrobr&#225;s,&#8221; Brazil&#8217;s
flagship corporation, a source of national pride, and a funder
of numerous cultural causes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Headline-Generating Cases &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for Oliveira, Motta Veiga says, the U.S. has no
equivalent official. As a tenured civil servant, Oliveira cannot
be dismissed as someone motivated by lust for campaign
contributions or reelection. This species of prosecutor,
however, makes a name by bringing headline-generating cases,
often framed in the most extreme terms imaginable, with the
widely held expectation that in due course the judicial process
will winnow down the allegations and damage claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He can ask for the highest damages possible,&#8221; says
Claudio dell&#8217;Orto, president of the Rio State Magistrates
Association. &#8220;Then, with the evidence, the value gets
adjusted.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks the situation got even more complicated.
Going after Chevron, it&#8217;s become clear, will have collateral
consequences. The controversy has been a factor in the delayed
bidding process for the presalt oil fields, which will be the
first round of offshore licensing in Brazil since 2008.
Originally scheduled for late 2011, the globally awaited auction
is now expected in 2013 at the earliest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Leak &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petrobr&#225;s on March&#160;30 spoke for the first time about the
Frade affair. In a Brazilian regulatory filing, the company
warned investors that it theoretically could bear some liability
for the accident and called Oliveira&#8217;s gigantic damage estimates
&#8220;unreasonable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron on April&#160;7 announced that while investigating the
ocean floor near Frade, it found a small amount of oil leaking
from the sea bed of a Petrobr&#225;s-controlled field called Ronador
-- this was the last in the series of minor Petrobr&#225;s leaks to
which Motta Veira referred. This alert was met by a lack of
excitement among Brazilian journalists and public officials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two days later, on April&#160;9, while accompanying President
Rousseff on an official state visit to Washington, Petrobr&#225;s CEO
Maria das Gra&#231;as Foster commented on the Frade spill and
Chevron. &#8220;We have a very good partnership in Brazil,&#8221; she said
at an event at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, &#8220;but they are the
operators, so they need to give the official answers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First Welcome News &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, on April&#160;11, Chevron received its first welcome
news in the matter when a Brazilian federal judge denied a
request from the prosecutor Oliveira to suspend the company from
operating in the country as part of his multibillion-dollar
suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron said in a statement it &#8220;acted diligently and
appropriately, and in accordance with the best practices in the
oil industry.&#8221; The denial of the injunction suggests the
judiciary will examine the legal actions against Chevron and its
employees with appropriate skepticism, says David Meiler, a
partner with Felsberg  Associates, a Rio law firm that
represents drilling contractors but is not involved in the Frade
case. &#8220;This is actually an opportunity for the judiciary to
demonstrate its independence,&#8221; Meiler adds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early May the judge allowed Buck and four other foreign
workers to leave Brazil on the condition that they return to
face the still-pending criminal charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barring evidence of malfeasance, Meiler predicts that none
will go to prison. All charges against one Chevron employee have
already been dropped, the company says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the moment, the threat still hangs over them, and the
Brazilian legal system grinds slowly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is going to take forever, unfortunately,&#8221; Meiler
says. Oliveira, the prosecutor, explains that in Portuguese,
&#8220;forever&#8221; translates into &#8220;five, six, 10 years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) unveiled a new design
for its Bing Internet search engine to make results more social
by listing related functions and content from a user&#8217;s friends,
without encroaching on regular query results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new design, being introduced in the U.S. over the next
few days, divides the Web page into three. On the left, the
biggest pane displays basic search results. The center column
lists tasks associated with the query -- looking for restaurants
will bring up maps and reservations pages. The final column
shows related content from friends, such as who could help with
the search and who &#8220;liked&#8221; an eatery on Facebook (FB) Inc.&#8217;s site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The update is the biggest change since the release of Bing
three years ago, when Microsoft completely overhauled its search
offerings, the company said in a blog post today. Microsoft
accounted for 15.3 percent of U.S. searches in March, according
to ComScore Inc., compared with 66.4 percent for market leader
Google Inc. (GOOG) The changes build on a partnership between Microsoft
and Facebook to integrate social data into search results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft held an event today in San Francisco to
demonstrate the new product. The new design will be available on
mobile devices in the coming weeks, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bing previously listed social content together with regular
search results, though few people used the function, and
customers complained it cluttered the results and made them
&#8220;noisy,&#8221; said Stefan Weitz, a director for Bing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Microsoft Study &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based company said its basic search
results are now preferred to Google by users in a recent blind
study it conducted. The study, which shows search results
without telling test subjects whether they are from Bing or
Google, showed 43 percent preferred Bing, while 28 percent
preferred Google. In the same Microsoft study done in January
2011, 34 percent chose Bing to Google&#8217;s 38 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Bing design&#8217;s middle pane, which displays actions
related to queries, relies on partnerships with companies like
Yelp Inc., OpenTable Inc. (OPEN) and ticket-comparison site FanSnap,
Microsoft said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The social sidebar lets searchers pose the query to their
Facebook friends, gives a list of friends with expertise in the
area of the search and lists people who may be influential on
that topic outside of the searcher&#8217;s friend list by culling data
from sites like Twitter Inc., Foursquare Labs Inc., LinkedIn
Corp. and Google&#8217;s Google+ social network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Reinvent Search&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is trying to gain users by taking the huge
volume of social data created -- articles people read, songs
they listen to and places they&#8217;ve visited -- and funneling it
into search results, said Qi Lu, president of Microsoft&#8217;s online
services division, in a speech at the event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Search, the gateway to the Web, needs to be reinvented to
unlock that vast potential,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We aspire to lead
innovation that will reinvent search for the future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pane also has an activity feed that shows questions
your friends have asked and posts they have chosen to share.
Users can answer the questions or &#8220;like&#8221; the post and the
activity will show up in both Bing and Facebook, the world&#8217;s
largest social-networking service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google in January announced a service called Search, Plus

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, positioned itself for a decline in
the value of Spanish government bonds and a rally in Italian
sovereign debt during the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s &#8220;market exposure&#8221; to Spanish government bonds
shifted to a negative $446 million in March from a positive $151
million in December, the New York-based firm disclosed in a
quarterly regulatory filing. For Italian sovereign debt, the
exposure surged to $2.51 billion in March from $210 million in
December, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs discloses the firm&#8217;s credit and market stance
for Italy, Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain each quarter
because those five countries are viewed by investors as Europe&#8217;s
riskiest. Concern about the continent&#8217;s financial crisis has
reignited since the end of the quarter as Greek voters balked at
austerity measures and Spain prepared a fourth attempt to
overhaul its financial system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Credit exposure&#8221; shows the risk from a default or credit
deterioration of the counterparty or borrower, and &#8220;market
exposure&#8221; is the potential loss tied to price changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total credit exposure to the five nations fell 14 percent
in the first quarter to $2.52 billion from $2.93 billion,
according to the filing. Total market exposure more than
quadrupled to $2.68 billion from $585 million. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s bankrupt Quigley Co.
unit will continue its eight-year bankruptcy, and seeks to
challenge a federal appeals court ruling, a Pfizer lawyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jay Goffman told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart Bernstein in
Manhattan court today that Pfizer may challenge a higher court&#8217;s
ruling in April that found Pfizer isn&#8217;t entitled to protection
from some asbestos claims related to Quigley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer also plans to proceed with Quigley&#8217;s bankruptcy, and
seeks to have it exit court protection in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think they got it wrong,&#8221; Goffman said of the April
appeals court ruling, adding that Pfizer may bring a challenge
to the U.S. Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quigley, founded in 1916, made three products for the steel
industry from the 1940s to the 1970s that contained asbestos.
Pfizer bought Quigley in 1968, and the company stopped most
operations in 1992, filing for bankruptcy in 2004. Pfizer has
said it never made or sold any Quigley products, and some
claimants hadn&#8217;t released Pfizer from alleged &#8220;derivative
liability.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernstein had ruled in bankruptcy court that Quigley&#8217;s
Chapter 11 case barred certain lawsuits against Pfizer. A May
2011 decision in district court reversed the order, and Pfizer
had appealed that ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We affirm the district court,&#8221; three judges said in
April&#8217;s ruling that upheld the May decision. In doing so, they
found that the law firm Peter G. Angelos can sue Pfizer based on
manufacturer liability under Pennsylvania law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1999 Lawsuits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angelos began bringing lawsuits against Pfizer in 1999,
saying that because the drug company&#8217;s logo appeared on Quigley
products, it should have liability for the asbestos-containing
products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goffman also told Bernstein today that Quigley plans to
file a Chapter 11 plan by the end of the month that is based on
terms with creditors it has already negotiated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for creditors as well as the U.S. Trustee, an arm
of the Justice Department that oversees bankruptcies, said they
would object to any plan that was the same as the old one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t want a do-over of what happened last time,&#8221;
said Greg Zipes, a lawyer for the U.S. Trustee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Trustee, an arm of the Justice Department, had
asked the bankruptcy court to end Quigley&#8217;s Chapter 11, citing
the fact that creditors alleging asbestos-related health issues
have been unable to sue New York-based Pfizer during the case,
and many of them have died. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Manipulated Process &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernstein had said that Pfizer had manipulated the
bankruptcy process, and refused to allow Quigley to exit Chapter
11 court protection under a deal with Pfizer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Quigley&#8217;s bankruptcy, a committee of creditors known
as the &#8220;Ad Hoc Committee of Tort Victims&#8221; also asked in
October 2010 to have Quigley&#8217;s bankruptcy dismissed so it could
bring tort claims, which are otherwise blocked by bankruptcy
law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asbestos claims against Quigley may total $4.45 billion
during the next 42 years, according to testimony cited by
Bernstein in September. In November, Pfizer reported a $701
million third-quarter charge for asbestos litigation related to
Quigley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Quigley Co., 04-15739, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The appeals
case is 11-2635, 11-2767, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The euro and Europe&#8217;s handling of its
sovereign-debt crisis are being driven in part by Germany&#8217;s
desire for a stronger fiscal and political union, according to
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s Jim O&#8217;Neill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany entered the European Union &#8220;looking for a European
monetary union that had stronger fiscal and political aspects to
it than was actually agreed,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill, chairman of Goldman
Sachs Asset Management, said in a radio interview on &#8220;Bloomberg
Surveillance&#8221; with Tom Keene and Ken Prewitt. &#8220;They are using
a lot of these problems in some of these Club Med countries as
an excuse, possibly quite a valid one, to try and create a
stronger underlying framework, something a bit more like a
United States of Europe.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greek political turmoil entered its fourth day following
weekend elections where voters revolted against austerity, with
coalition talks over a new government deadlocked. The standoff
reignited bets that Greece, where Europe&#8217;s debt crisis began,
won&#8217;t be able to hold to the terms of its EU-led bailouts and
may leave the currency bloc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro rose 0.2 percent to $1.2959 in New York after
falling to $1.2912 yesterday, the weakest level since Jan. 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The German game plan is pretty clear, and the big reality
for every other country is: Do you want to be part of it or
not?&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs executive took up his current position in
2010 after a career at the investment bank covering currencies
and economics, during which time he created the BRICs acronym to
describe large emerging markets. Before joining in 1995, he
worked at Swiss Bank Corp. and Bank of America Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Confusing Commentary &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commentary from politicians and possibly some central
bankers has been confusing because some are using the market
turmoil to try to advance their policies, O&#8217;Neill said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A departure from the euro agreement by the Netherlands
probably &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t have big consequences&#8221; for the nation,
O&#8217;Neill said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine why the Netherlands should leave, but I
think if they did, they&#8217;d cope with it perfectly fine,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;That said, if you have genuine real, core countries like
the Netherlands starting to leave or thinking about leaving,
then you would have much bigger fundamental picture about why
does it exist in the first place.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Bloomberg Global Poll, 57 percent of the 1,253
investors, analysts and traders who are Bloomberg subscribers
said at least one country will abandon the euro by year-end and
80 percent expected more pain for Europe&#8217;s bond markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core euro-region countries of Germany, France,
Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Austria were &#8220;very, very
sound,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said. &#8220;It was as soon as you went beyond those
countries where you started to have question marks,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, raised estimates of potential
losses from legal claims by 13 percent and said a probe into its
handling of Greek finances includes trading and research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forecast of &#8220;reasonably possible&#8221; legal costs rose to
$2.7 billion as of March 31 from $2.4 billion three months
earlier, according to a regulatory filing today. The New York-based firm didn&#8217;t give specific reasons for the increase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks started releasing estimates of possible losses after
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission told finance chiefs
in October 2010 that they should disclose such costs &#8220;when
there is at least a reasonable possibility&#8221; they may be
incurred, even if the risk is too low to require reserves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estimate doesn&#8217;t include potential losses from legal
matters that are at an early stage or where the firm can&#8217;t
determine the potential amount, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An investigation of the firm&#8217;s financing and swap
transactions with the Greek government, which started about two
years ago, also includes &#8220;trading and research activities with
respect to Greek sovereign debt,&#8221; according to today&#8217;s filing.
&#8220;Goldman Sachs has cooperated with the investigations and
reviews,&#8221; the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Financial Crisis Probe &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs also disclosed the U.S. Department of Justice
and SEC are investigating the firm&#8217;s role in the 2008 financial
crisis. Those inquiries stem from last year&#8217;s report by the
Senate&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which said
the firm misled clients about mortgage-related investments
before the crisis. Goldman Sachs has denied wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is in arbitration with a California school
district and the cities of Houston, Texas, and Reno, Nevada,
over Goldman Sachs&#8217;s role as an underwriter and broker-dealer
for more than $1.7 billion in auction-rate securities from 2004
and 2007, according to the filing. In those cases, which started
in February, the cities and school districts seek unspecified
damages, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is also facing a suit from the founders and
majority shareholders of Dragon Systems Inc. who exchanged their
stake in Dragon for stock in Lernout  Hauspie Speech Products
NV in 2000, according to the filing. LH went bankrupt on Nov.
29, 2000. The majority shareholders and Goldman Sachs asked for
summary judgment on various claims last month, according to the
filing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, redeemed about $250 million from
hedge funds during the first quarter as it begins to comply with
rules requiring banks to reduce such investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm can &#8220;generally&#8221; redeem as much as 25 percent of
its holdings in hedge funds at any quarter-end with 91 days&#8217;
notice, New York-based Goldman Sachs said in a quarterly filing
today. The company had $3.06 billion in hedge-fund stakes at the
end of March, according to the filing, which didn&#8217;t say which
fund investments were pulled during the quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the Volcker rule provision of the Dodd-Frank
financial-reform law, federally backed banks are required to
limit their investments in private equity and hedge funds to no
more than 3 percent of the fund or 3 percent of the bank&#8217;s Tier
1 capital. Goldman Sachs&#8217;s fund stakes were worth $17.2 billion
at the end of March and the firm was committed to providing an
additional $7.77 billion to the funds, the filing showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We currently expect to redeem up to approximately 10
percent of certain hedge funds&#8217; total redeemable units per
quarter over 10 consecutive quarters, beginning March 2012 and
ending June 2014,&#8221; Goldman Sachs said in the filing. &#8220;In
addition, we have limited the firm&#8217;s initial investment to 3
percent for certain new funds.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fair value of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s stakes in private-equity
funds totaled $8.83 billion at the end of March and the company
owed the funds $3.07 billion in &#8220;unfunded commitments,&#8221;
according to the filing. The value of private debt fund
investments amounted to $3.74 billion. Unfunded commitments to
those funds totaled $3.24 billion, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Transition Period &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The firm continues to manage its existing private-equity
funds taking into account the transition periods under the
Volcker rule,&#8221; according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stakes in real estate funds were worth $1.54 billion at the
end of March and the bank owed $1.46 billion to those funds,
according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s investments in private-equity, private debt
and real estate funds aren&#8217;t eligible for redemption, according
to the filing. The firm expects to receive distributions from
the funds as their underlying assets are sold, &#8220;and it is
estimated that substantially all of the underlying assets of the
existing funds will be liquidated over the next 10 years,&#8221;
according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), one of the
five U.S. banks with the biggest positions in over-the-counter
derivatives, may owe counterparties $2.21 billion if its credit
rating falls two levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counterparties could demand the money in collateral and
termination payments, the New York-based bank said in a
quarterly filing today. A one-level reduction would require
$1.33 billion in payments, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, is
under review by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service for a possible two-level downgrade to A3 from A1. The credit rater said in February
it was examining ratings of 17 banks and securities firms with
global capital-market operations. Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse
Group AG (CSGN) and UBS AG (UBSN) may be cut three levels, Moody&#8217;s said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Dec. 31, a two-level cut would have obliged Goldman
Sachs to pay $2.18 billion in collateral and terminations, the
firm reported in February. A one-level reduction would have
required $1.3 billion as of December, the firm reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was among five companies that accounted for
96 percent of the total U.S. banking industry&#8217;s notional
holdings in derivatives and 86 percent of net current credit
exposure in derivatives as of December, according to the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the Wall
Street bank that generated 57 percent of its first-quarter
revenue from trading, had a loss from that business on one day
in the period, down from 17 during the preceding three months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s traders made more than $100 million on 24 of the
62 days in the quarter ended March 31, according to a quarterly
regulatory filing today by the New York-based company. The
quarter produced the fewest days of trading losses since the
first quarter of 2011, the filing shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
reported last month that revenue from trading stocks, bonds and
other securities dropped 14 percent in the first quarter from a
year earlier. That followed a 21 percent decline in trading
revenue for 2011, the worst performance since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, the sixth-biggest U.S. bank, said this week
that its traders lost money on four days during the first
quarter, up from three a year earlier. Bank of America Corp.,
the No. 2 U.S. lender, reported last week that it had trading
profits on every day in the period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading losses never exceeded Goldman Sachs&#8217;s value-at-risk
limit -- a measure of how much the company estimates it could
lose in the securities markets in a single day -- during the
quarter, according to the filing. Average daily value-at-risk
dropped to $95 million in the three months ended March 31, from
$135 million in the prior period, the firm reported on April 17. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) stood by its
forecast for a rally in gold this year, saying that the precious
metal will advance to $1,840 an ounce over six months as the U.S.
central bank embarks on a third round of stimulus in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold remains the &#8220;currency of last resort,&#8221; according to
analysts led by Jeffrey Currie in a report dated yesterday, the
same day that the price sank to the lowest level in four months
as Europe&#8217;s escalating debt crisis boosted the dollar. The
restated gold forecast implies a 16 percent surge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerns that Greece may leave the euro reignited Europe&#8217;s
crisis this week, driving commodities including gold lower along
with base metals, crude oil and equities as the dollar climbed.
The 17-nation euro area is on the verge of losing one of its
members, according to a Bloomberg Global Poll published today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In early 2009, we suggested that gold had become the
currency of last resort, overtaking the U.S. dollar&#8217;s status due
to the rising risk of sovereign default and debasement
concerns,&#8221; Currie wrote. Even as the U.S. currency advanced and
gold fell on the European crisis in recent months, &#8220;it is too
early for the dollar to reclaim this status,&#8221; he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold for June delivery on the Comex dropped 0.3 percent to
$1,589.30 an ounce at 5:25 p.m. in Singapore, declining for a
fourth day as Greek leaders struggled to form a government
following elections at the weekend. The metal, which has lost 17
percent from its all-time high of $1,923.70 in September, is on
course for a fourth monthly drop in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Remains in Place&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The case for higher gold prices remains in place,&#8221; the
analysts wrote. &#8220;U.S. economic and employment data has now
disappointed for several weeks, European election results point
to further stress in the euro area, while anecdotal data
suggests that physical gold demand remains resilient.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Reserve will announce additional monetary
easing when policy makers meet next month, Jan Hatzius, chief
economist at New York-based Goldman, predicted in a report on
May 8. The central bank bought $2.3 trillion of bonds in two
rounds of quantitative easing from December 2008 to June 2011 to
drive the recovery in the world&#8217;s largest economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. payrolls climbed by 115,000 workers in April, the
smallest increase in six months, Labor Department reported last
week, boosting concern that the recovery may falter. The jobless
rate fell to a three-year low of 8.1 percent as people left the
labor force, adding to worries that the expansion is cooling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ETP Holdings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold, which has still risen 1.4 percent in New York in 2012,
has rallied for 11 straight years as investors sought a hedge
against inflation and central banks expanded reserves. Holdings
in bullion-backed exchange-traded products are at 2,382.016
metric tons, about 1.2 percent below the March 13 record, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging-market central banks continued to purchase gold
for reserves, while demand in largest user India may gain after
the government withdrew an excise tax on precious-metal jewelry,
the analysts wrote. A jump in imports into mainland China from
Hong Kong also pointed to strong growth in demand, they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s forecast for additional easing from the U.S.
central bank is similar to that from Bill Gross, who runs
Pacific Investment Management Co.&#8217;s Total Return Fund, the
world&#8217;s largest mutual fund. A decision to buy more debt is
&#8220;getting closer,&#8221; Gross wrote on Twitter this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro declined to $1.2912 yesterday, the lowest level
since Jan. 23. In the Bloomberg Global Poll, 57 percent of 1,253
investors, analysts and traders who are Bloomberg subscribers

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Co. (EEEK), the
world&#8217;s second-largest bottler of Coke drinks, posted a wider
loss in the first quarter as bad weather and austerity measures
in European markets hit demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s net loss in the three months to March 31
widened to 28.4 million euros ($36.8 million) from 8.9 million
euros a year earlier, Coca-Cola HBC said today in a statement on
its website. The higher cost of sugar also hurt profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Despite a challenging external environment, we grew or
maintained volume share in sparkling beverages, while on a
currency-neutral basis, excluding the hyperinflation impact of
Belarus, net sales revenue per case of drinks rose 3 percent,&#8221;
Dimitris Lois, chief executive officer, said in a telephone
interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excluding the cost of reorganization, the net loss was 18.6
million euros, up from a loss of 1 million euros. &#8220;We are on
target with restructuring,&#8221; Lois said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Athens-based company plans to book about 50 million
euros for restructuring this year, which will bring savings of
35 million euros a year from 2013, while steps taken last year
will see benefits of about 40 million euros this year, according
to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While cases of drinks sold fell 2 percent to 425 million,
as the effect of austerity measures in countries such as Greece
and Ireland and cold weather in central and eastern Europe hurt
demand, revenue rose 1 percent to 1.14 billion euros. Greece
accounts for 6 percent of sales, Lois said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Volatile Outlook &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The economic outlook in Europe is volatile and we expect
consumer confidence to remain weak throughout this year,&#8221; Lois
said. There will also be &#8220;a high single-digit increase&#8221; in
input costs; however, the company is confident that managing
revenue growth will offset the impact, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher  costs, especially that of sugar, had a greater
effect this quarter as there was a steep rise after the first
quarter of 2011, magnifying the year-on-year effect, Lois said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company hopes to benefit from the London Summer Olympic
Games and the Euro 2012 soccer championship, Lois said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final tournament of the soccer championship will be
hosted jointly, between June 8 and July 1, by Poland and
Ukraine, both Coca-Cola HBC territories, while another five
participating countries are also company markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola HBC reiterated capital spending guidance for
2012-14 of 1.45 billion euros and the same amount in free cash
flow generation. The company also plans to seek approval for a
share buyback program. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India barred Oriental Nicety,
formerly Exxon Valdez that caused the 1989 Alaska oil spill,
from the nation&#8217;s biggest ship-breaking yard after an activist
filed a petition in the Supreme Court saying the vessel
contained toxic material. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gujarat Pollution Control Board denied the ship entry
into Alang, on India&#8217;s western coast, for scrapping, as the
&#8220;matter is sub-judice,&#8221; Hardik Shah, its member secretary,
said in a telephone interview last night from the state capital
Gandhinagar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gopal Krishna, a New Delhi-based activist with ToxicsWatch
Alliance, told the Supreme Court last month that the ship had
asbestos and heavy metals on board. Concerns that ships with
hazardous material are entering India have mounted in recent
years as Alang competes with yards in China, Pakistan and
Bangladesh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Priya Blue Industries Pvt. a Gujarat, western India-based
company that bought the ship for scrapping, will file a reply in
the court next week, its founder Sanjay Mehta said. He denied
the vessel, now converted into a bulk-carrier, had any toxic
material on board. The ship is currently in international waters
off India&#8217;s west coast, Mehta said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court asked the Indian government and Ministry
of Shipping to provide information on the steps taken to prevent
the ship&#8217;s berthing at any of the nation&#8217;s ports, according to a
May 3 order posted on the court&#8217;s website. The next hearing on
the case is scheduled for August 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Alaska Oil Spill &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1989, the Exxon Valdez spilt 11 million gallons of oil
into Alaska&#8217;s Prince William Sound, devastating wildlife and
local businesses. Victims of the spill sued Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)
and won a $5 billion punitive damage award in 1994. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The award was cut after a series of appeals by Exxon over
the next 14 years, and eventually in 2008 a divided U.S. Supreme
Court reduced the punitive damages to $507.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the petition filed in India&#8217;s Supreme Court, Krishna
said the 301 meter-long ship was purchased by Best Oasis Ltd., a
unit of Priya Blue, for $16 million. Mehta declined to comment
on the price of the vessel, built in 1986. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alang, which opened in 1982, has the capacity to break
ships of about 4 million metric tons a year, according to
Gujarat Maritime Board website. The yard gives direct employment
to about 25,000 workers, according to the Board. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cafe du Parc at the Willard
InterContinental Hotel in Washington is bustling with D.C.
tourists and buttoned-down business travelers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;m with a different kind of guest. Caroline Cannon, an
Inupiat from Point Hope, Alaska, population 700, is this year&#8217;s
North American Goldman Prize winner. The 55-year-old grandmother
of 26 won the environmental award for her part in a campaign to
stop the oil-drilling rush in the Arctic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wearing bracelets made of whale teeth and ivory, she
describes the subsistence living her people eke out in the
Chukchi Sea, their reliance on the bowhead whale, walrus and
bearded seal for food, clothing and jewelry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s a fascinating life for someone like me who relies on
the subway, keyboard and smartphone. Still, what does she tell
people who say: We need the oil? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We didn&#8217;t create this problem, it&#8217;s the consumers,&#8221;
Cannon says, noting the contrast between the images on my laptop
of her remote Alaskan village and the Cafe du Parc clientele,
the Pennsylvania Avenue traffic outside. &#8220;These are two
different worlds.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cannon has been the face and voice of her Inupiat community
in hundreds of government and industry meetings, making the case
for her people and their connection to the Chukchi Sea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I know there&#8217;s a need, but please, don&#8217;t be practicing it
in my backyard,&#8221; she says. &#8220;We have to be careful how we do
it. I don&#8217;t want my great-grandchildren to read about my culture
in a library.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Drilling Stopped &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She and a coalition of environmental groups managed to stop
the drilling in a number of proposed gas and oil leases in 2009,
when a federal court ruled that the impact on the marine
environment had not been adequately studied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I was flooded with tears,&#8221; says Cannon, remembering that
victory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the push to drill is strong, and backed by
enormous stakes. When Shell Oil purchased leasing rights in the
Chukchi for $2.1 billion in 2008, Executive Vice President David Lawrence declared that Alaska has &#8220;the potential to become a
new heartland for Shell.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of the Interior estimates that there are
26.6 billion barrels of recoverable oil and 130 trillion cubic
feet of natural gas under the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. This
year, the federal government has approved Shell&#8217;s spill-response
plans, clearing a major hurdle for the company to begin
exploratory wells in the summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Apparently Shell has convinced them that there is a
technology to clean an oil spill in the Arctic, but they&#8217;ve
never proven that fact,&#8221; Cannon says. &#8220;They have not tested,
and I wouldn&#8217;t want it to be tested in my backyard.  When I say
&#8216;my,&#8217; I&#8217;m referring to my grandkids, the 26 grandkids that I
have.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On Thin Ice &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil spills are a potential threat, but climate change is
already affecting the Inupiat hunting grounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see it. Two years ago we weren&#8217;t able to pitch our
tent out there (on thin ice), and safety was an issue. I&#8217;m
hearing that we are able this season and I&#8217;m anxious to go
back,&#8221; says Cannon. &#8220;It&#8217;s so meaningful and so precious when
you&#8217;re out there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmentalists might question supporting a cause that
centers on killing endangered whales, but times have changed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I guess back in the day when my parents were alive, 20 or
30 years ago, if they heard about the environmental groups, they
had a different version. They said we were slaughtering them,
and that they considered the bowhead whale to be an endangered
species,&#8221; she says, adding that it was commercial whalers from
Boston and San Francisco that decimated the whale population,
not Eskimos hunting from boats made of sealskin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;We Don&#8217;t Waste&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve only ever taken what we are expected to survive on,
and we do it with respect. We only take what&#8217;s given to us, and
we don&#8217;t waste it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recipients of the Goldman Prize are awarded $150,000,
which, in Cannon&#8217;s case, will end up back in the community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My tribe, my native village in Point Hope is in financial
need right now,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I&#8217;ve always wanted to build a soup
kitchen in our community, and that would be with my church. I
want to help my community whichever way I can help them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is weary of the media attention she has endured in
recent weeks, so I ask her just one more question: What next for
Caroline Cannon? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m going to go home and go whaling, because that&#8217;s who I
am.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve officials are
gathering more information about the trading position that led
to a $2 billion loss at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), which they have
known about for several weeks, according to a person familiar
with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed officials don&#8217;t view it as their role to approve or
reject individual trades at banks, the person said. Rather,
their job is to ensure the firms have sufficient capital to
withstand losses, said the person, who wasn&#8217;t authorized to
discuss the matter and asked not to be identified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon announced the
&#8220;egregious&#8221; trading loss yesterday, two months after the
biggest U.S. bank by assets passed a Fed stress test that put
its loans and securities through a scenario of deep recession
and a simulated global financial market shock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is the way the system should work,&#8221; said Mark Calabria, a former Senate Banking Committee staff member and now
director of financial regulation studies at the Cato Institute
in Washington. &#8220;The capital should be there to actually absorb
losses.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission opened a
preliminary investigation into JPMorgan&#8217;s disclosures related to
the trades, according to a person briefed on the probe who spoke
on condition of anonymity because the matter isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s announcement points to gaps in the Fed&#8217;s
enforcement of governance and risk management, said Robert Eisenbeis, a former research director at the Atlanta Fed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Watching the Store&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fact that Jamie Dimon could come out and make some of
those statements&#8221; raises &#8220;lots of questions about who was
watching the store,&#8221; said Eisenbeis, who is now chief monetary
economist at Sarasota, Florida-based Cumberland Advisors. The
Fed &#8220;ought to be going in and looking at the internal controls
and monitoring procedures that the institution is taking, and
stress those.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krishna Guha, a spokesman for Federal Reserve Bank of New
York, JPMorgan&#8217;s regulator, declined to comment. JPMorgan
spokesman Joseph Evangelisti also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Stability Oversight Council, a group of
regulators charged with preventing a financial crisis, wasn&#8217;t
convened to discuss the JPMorgan loss and had no plans to meet,
said a Treasury Department official who declined to be
identified. The council is chaired by Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and includes Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Capital Ratio &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s tier 1 common capital ratio, a measure of
capital strength tracked by the Fed, never dipped below 5
percent in the 2012 stress scenario despite a hypothetical $28
billion in trading and counterparty losses and $56 billion in
loan losses, according to results of the stress tests released
on March 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think this particular number is big enough to get
in the way of the capital buffers that JPMorgan has,&#8221; Robert Engle, winner of the Nobel Prize in economics, said of the $2
billion loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think of JPMorgan as being one of the more systemic
institutions because it is so big,&#8221; said Engle, a professor at
New York University&#8217;s Stern School of Business, who helped
develop a model of systemic risk at the school&#8217;s Volatility Lab.
&#8220;But because it is big, a loss like this is not going to bring
it to its knees.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares fell 9.3 percent to $36.96 at the close of
trading today in New York. The KBW Bank Index of 24 financial
stocks was down 1.2 percent to 46.40. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the
main U.S. derivatives regulator, has been reviewing JPMorgan&#8217;s
derivatives trading activities since last month, according to
another person who was briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CFTC hasn&#8217;t opened an enforcement action against the
bank, according to the person, who spoke on condition of
anonymity because the review is private. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon said the firm suffered a $2 billion trading
loss after an &#8220;egregious&#8221; failure in a unit managing risks,
jeopardizing Wall Street banks&#8217; efforts to loosen a federal ban
on bets with their own money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s chief investment office, run by Ina Drew, 55,
took flawed positions on synthetic credit securities that remain
volatile and may cost an additional $1 billion this quarter or
next, Dimon told analysts yesterday. Losses mounted as JPMorgan
tried to mitigate transactions designed to hedge credit
exposure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There were many errors, sloppiness and bad judgment,&#8221;
Dimon said as the company&#8217;s stock fell in extended trading.
&#8220;These were egregious mistakes, they were self-inflicted.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chief investment office was thrust into the debate over
U.S. efforts to ban proprietary trading when Bloomberg News
reported last month that the unit had taken bets so big that
JPMorgan, the largest and most profitable U.S. bank, probably
couldn&#8217;t unwind them without losing money or roiling financial
markets. Dimon, 56, had transformed the unit in recent years to
make bigger and riskier speculative trades with the bank&#8217;s
money, five former employees said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s $2 billion
trading loss has intensified the call for tighter regulation in
Washington, with presidential campaign officials weighing in
alongside lawmakers in response to the bank&#8217;s disclosure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any progress by financial-industry lobbyists in securing
changes to the Dodd-Frank Act&#8217;s proprietary-trading ban may have
been halted with the May 10 announcement by Jamie Dimon,
JPMorgan&#8217;s chairman and chief executive officer, said
Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who co-wrote the regulatory overhaul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They sensed some momentum in undercutting things, but
this strengthens our case strongly politically,&#8221; Frank said
yesterday in a telephone interview. &#8220;It tears a lot of holes in
Jamie&#8217;s arguments.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, New York-based JPMorgan is facing new
scrutiny, with lawmakers calling for hearings, Securities and
Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro saying her agency is
monitoring the bank. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission
planning to review the loss, according to a person briefed on
the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, 56, has been a prominent critic of Dodd-Frank
provisions including the so-called Volcker rule, which is meant
to bar proprietary trading by banks with federally insured
deposits. In a conference call to discuss the losses stemming
from &#8220;egregious&#8221; failures in the bank&#8217;s chief investment
office, Dimon accurately forecast the Washington response. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Very Unfortunate&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is very unfortunate,&#8221; Dimon said. &#8220;It plays right
into all the hands of a bunch of pundits out there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Tim Johnson, the South Dakota Democrat who leads
the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement that the loss
underlines why &#8220;opponents of Wall Street reform must not be
allowed to gut important protections for the financial system
and taxpayers.&#8221; Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican who
serves on the committee, called yesterday for hearings on the
loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sean Oblack, Johnson&#8217;s spokesman, said in a statement that
the Banking Committee is &#8220;waiting to learn more of the facts
before making a decision on a hearing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who co-wrote the
trading ban named for former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, said in a conference call with reporters that the loss
shows Dimon&#8217;s view to be &#8220;dramatically proven wrong.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Telling Moment&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a very telling moment and I guess we should thank
JPMorgan for exposing an area where we clearly need more
oversight,&#8221; Jared Bernstein, former chief economist for Vice
President Joe Biden, said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for Republican presidential
contender Mitt Romney, said yesterday that the loss
&#8220;demonstrates the importance of oversight and transparency in
the derivatives market, something Governor Romney has called for
in the past.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As president, Governor Romney will push for common-sense
regulation that gives regulators tools to do their jobs, and
that gives investors more clarity,&#8221; Saul said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romney, a former private-equity executive who served as
Massachusetts governor, declined to answer questions about
JPMorgan during a campaign rally yesterday in Charlotte, North
Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Textbook Illustration&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin and Senator Jeff Merkley, the Oregon Democrat who co-wrote the proprietary-trading provision, said yesterday during
their conference call that JPMorgan has become a &#8220;textbook
illustration&#8221; of why federal regulators should tighten the
restrictions being drafted in the Volcker rule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Four years after the downfall of Bear Stearns, Lehman
Brothers and the hundreds of billions in a bank bailout, we
still see that there is a nagging need for regulators to
implement financial reforms which became law in 2010,&#8221; Bart Chilton, a Democrat on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street firms such as JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) have lobbied regulators including the
Fed, Securities and Exchange Commission and Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. to expand exemptions included in their initial
Volcker rule proposal, complaining that the measure is so broad
and ill-defined that it will increase risks for clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule would allow banks to continue activities that are
considered hedging, as well as to serve as market-makers,
accepting risk or holding shares of trades to facilitate client
orders. Levin and Merkley said JPMorgan&#8217;s loss shows the need
for a stricter interpretation of the hedging exemption included
in the draft proposal released in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon has said the trade wouldn&#8217;t have run afoul of the
Volcker rule restrictions, which are scheduled to take effect on
July 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frank said he planned to use the bank&#8217;s loss to defend the
law against efforts to roll back derivatives regulations and
force wider exemptions in the Volcker rule. He pointed to the
impact of the losses on Dimon, who has been the leading voice
against many of the regulations Frank put into place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This will diminish his ability to be that voice,&#8221; Frank
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s trading loss
of about $2 billion underscores the need for the &#8220;common-sense
regulation&#8221; of the financial industry that presumed Republican
nominee Mitt Romney would push as president, his campaign
spokeswoman said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loss &#8220;demonstrates the importance of oversight and
transparency in the derivatives market,&#8221; something &#8220;Romney has
called for in the past,&#8221; Andrea Saul, his press secretary, said
in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If elected, Romney would push for &#8220;common-sense regulation
that gives regulators tools to do their jobs and that gives
investors more clarity,&#8221; she said, without specifying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romney has called for repeal the Dodd-Frank law that
tightened regulation of financial institutions, which includes a
ban on proprietary trading by banks with federally insured
deposits. President Barack Obama helped guide the measure into
law in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romney, co-founder of private-equity firm Bain Capital LLC,
didn&#8217;t respond to a question from a reporter about the JPMorgan
loss at a campaign rally in Charlotte, North Carolina this
afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Previous Comments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked what kinds of financial regulation Romney would
support as president, his campaign pointed to comments he made
last year while campaigning in New Hampshire. He said then he
said he would favor regulating derivatives and imposing
different capital requirements on different forms of securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The campaign also referred to the 59-point economic plan
Romney released on Sept. 6, 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some of the concepts in Dodd-Frank have a place,&#8221; Romney
wrote in that document. &#8220;Greater transparency for inter-bank
relationships, enhanced capital requirements, and provisions to
address new forms of complex financial transactions are all
necessary elements of effective financial reform. But these
concepts must be translated into law in a way that creates a
simple, predictable, and efficient regulatory system appropriate
for our dynamic economy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama&#8217;s re-election campaign used the disclosure of JP
Morgan&#8217;s trading losses to criticize Romney&#8217;s call for less
financial regulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Rolling back Wall Street reform, as Mitt Romney proposes,
would be reckless,&#8221; Lis Smith, an Obama campaign spokeswoman,
said in a statement. &#8220;Returning to the failed policy of letting
Wall Street write their own rules would put all of us at greater
risk of another financial crisis and leave us vulnerable to
another taxpayer-funded bank bailout like the one shortly before
President Obama took office.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks fell, extending a weekly
decline, as banks tumbled after JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) disclosed a
$2 billion trading loss. Treasuries capped the longest run of
weekly gains since 1998, while commodities fell for an eighth
day to extend the longest slump in more than three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index lost 0.3 percent to close
at 1,353.39 at 4 p.m. in New York, sending it down 1.2 percent
in the week. The SP GSCI Index of 24 commodities lost 0.8
percent to extend this week&#8217;s slump to 1.7 percent and erase its
gain for the year. The advance in 10-year Treasuries sent yields
down two basis points to 1.84 percent as the benchmark note
completed an eighth weekly increase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial shares led losses as JPMorgan Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon blamed an &#8220;egregious&#8221; failure in trading
of synthetic credit securities for the trading loss, distracting
investors&#8217; attention from an unexpected increase in the Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment to a
four-year high. Commodities fell as China&#8217;s industrial
production grew the least since 2009 in April, spurring concern
demand for raw materials may wane. &lt;/p&gt;

JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, tumbled 6.7 percent after the close of regular U.S. trading as Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said the bank made egregious mistakes and trading losses were &#8220;self inflicted.&#8221; Close

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) fell the most in
nine months after Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said the
firm suffered a $2 billion trading loss he attributed to
&#8220;egregious&#8221; failures in a unit managing risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan dropped 9.3 percent to $36.96 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York, marking the stock&#8217;s biggest decline since Aug. 8 and the
day&#8217;s second-worst showing in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s chief investment office, run by Ina Drew, 55,
took flawed positions on synthetic credit securities that remain
volatile and may cost the lender an additional $1 billion this
quarter or next, Dimon, 56, said yesterday in a conference call
with analysts. The loss originated out of the firm&#8217;s London CIO
unit, an executive at the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There were many errors, sloppiness and bad judgment,&#8221;
Dimon said. &#8220;These were egregious mistakes, they were self-inflicted.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chief investment office was thrust into the debate over
U.S. efforts to ban proprietary trading when Bloomberg News
reported last month that the unit had taken bets so big that
JPMorgan, the largest and most profitable U.S. bank, probably
couldn&#8217;t unwind them without losing money or roiling financial
markets. Dimon, 56, had transformed the unit in recent years to
make bigger and riskier speculative trades with the bank&#8217;s
money, five former employees said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;FSA Examination &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K.&#8217;s Financial Services Authority, which regulates
banks, is examining the role London employees played in the
loss, according to two people familiar with the talks. The
agency hasn&#8217;t opened a formal investigation and there was no
evidence of criminal activity, these people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It will weigh on the sector pretty bad,&#8221; said Paul Miller, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets in Arlington,
Virginia. Miller and Christopher Mutascio at Stifel Nicolaus 
Co. downgraded their recommendations on the shares today.
&#8220;Investors are going to say that these are general big black
boxes that can&#8217;t be analyzed, not even the management companies
understand what they&#8217;re doing themselves.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon had defended the chief investment office as a
&#8220;sophisticated&#8221; guardian of the bank&#8217;s funds on an April 13
conference call, calling news coverage &#8220;a complete tempest in a
teapot.&#8221; On May 2, he led fellow Wall Street CEOs in a closed-door meeting to lobby the Federal Reserve about softening
proposed U.S. reforms that might crimp their profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Bunch of Pundits&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, he said the timing of the trading blunders
&#8220;plays right into the hands of a bunch of pundits out there&#8221;
who are pushing for a strict version of the proprietary trading
ban named for former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given Dimon&#8217;s resistance to the ban and new regulations,
&#8220;he&#8217;s got a lot of egg on his face right now,&#8221; said Craig Pirrong, a finance professor at the University of Houston. &#8220;Any
chance they had of getting a relative loosening of Volcker rule,
anything of that nature, that&#8217;s out the window.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chief investment office&#8217;s push into risk-taking was led
by Achilles Macris, 50, according to three former employees,
Bloomberg News reported on April 13. He was hired in 2006 as its
top executive in London and led an expansion into corporate and
mortgage-debt investments with a mandate to generate profits for
the New York-based bank, they said. Dimon closely supervised the
transition from its previous focus on protecting JPMorgan from
risks inherent in its banking business, such as interest-rate
and currency movements, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Talented People&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t call it &#8216;more aggressive,&#8217; I would call it
&#8216;better,&#8217;&#8221; Dimon told analysts yesterday. &#8220;We added different
types of people, talented people and stuff like that.&#8221; Until
recently, they were careful and successful, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s classic Wall Street hubris, which we&#8217;ve seen so many
times before,&#8221; said Simon Johnson, a former chief economist at
the International Monetary Fund who now teaches at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. &#8220;What&#8217;s particularly
ironic here is that Jamie presents himself, and is believed by
others to be, the king of risk management.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News first reported April 5 that London-based
JPMorgan trader Bruno Iksil had amassed positions linked to the
financial health of corporations that were so large he was
driving price moves in the $10 trillion market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $2 billion loss occurred in London under multiple
traders, according to an executive at the bank, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. Dimon wasn&#8217;t immediately told about
their shift in strategy and didn&#8217;t know the magnitude of the
losses until after the company reported earnings April 13, the
executive said. As the position deteriorated rapidly, the bank
gathered internal analysts and examiners to investigate, and
Dimon grew more distressed by the day, the executive said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Corrective Action&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While no one has been fired yet, Dimon told analysts he
will take &#8220;corrective action.&#8221; The bank is keeping employees
involved on hand while it deals with the transactions, and some
are likely to lose their jobs afterward, said an executive with
knowledge of the situation. The bank is also reevaluating its
risk-monitoring team within the chief investment office, the
person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan risks losing more money now because other market
participants will figure out what the bank has to do to unload
its position, said Charles Peabody, an analyst with Portales
Partners LLC in New York. Costs from the trades may affect
earnings through the end of the year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sharks to Blood &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When there&#8217;s blood in the water, the sharks are going to
attack that animal,&#8221; said Peabody, who downgraded his
recommendation on the stock in March to sector perform. &#8220;It
could make it very difficult for them to unwind a trade.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors bet more damage lies ahead. Bearish JPMorgan
options had the second-largest increase in trading among all
U.S. stocks today as 418,892 puts to sell JPMorgan shares
changed hands. That was 12 times the four-week average and 1.4
times the number of calls to buy, the data show. JPMorgan&#8217;s June
$35 puts were the most-traded options on the stock as they more
than tripled to 85 cents from a close of 26 cents yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 216 million JPMorgan shares traded, breaking the
prior one-day record set in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon declined on the call to discuss the specific
transactions or people involved. Synthetic credit products are
derivatives that generate gains and losses tied to credit
performance without the owner buying or selling actual debt.
JPMorgan used the instruments to hedge exposure on loans and
other credit risks tied to corporations, banks and sovereign
governments. The losses emerged after the firm tried to reduce
that position and unwind the portfolio, Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank said losses were partly offset by gains from the
sales from its available-for-sale credit portfolio, resulting in
a net loss for the firm&#8217;s corporate division, which includes the
CIO, of about $800 million after taxes. Dimon said losses could
widen or narrow in coming weeks and months, and that he can&#8217;t
estimate potential costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Long-Term Holdings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the bank repositions the synthetic credit portfolio, the
chief investment office &#8220;may hold certain of its current
synthetic credit positions for the longer term,&#8221; the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Hopefully, this will not be an issue by the end of the
year, but it does depend on the decisions and the markets,&#8221;
Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also changed how it calculates so-called value at
risk, or VAR, a measure of how much the company estimates it
could lose on securities on 95 percent of days. The company
restated its VAR for the first quarter, previously disclosed at
$67 million, at $129 million. The bank used a new model for
calculating its trading risk in the first quarter that Dimon
said was &#8220;inadequate.&#8221; It is reverting to the old model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hidden Risk &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a major event that confirms a lot of investors&#8217;
worst fears about bank risk,&#8221; said Frank Partnoy, a former
derivatives trader who&#8217;s now a law and finance professor at the
University of San Diego. Concern is &#8220;that at a large,
supposedly sophisticated institution, even something called a
&#8216;hedge&#8217; can contain all kinds of hidden risks that the senior
people don&#8217;t understand.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iksil may have amassed a $100 billion position in contracts
on Series 9 of the Markit CDX North America Investment Grade
Index, counterparts at hedge funds and rival banks said in
April. They based their estimates on the trades and price
movements they witnessed as well as their understanding of the
size and structure of the markets. The positions amounted to
tens of billions of dollars, under the firm&#8217;s own math, a person
familiar with its view said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two Dimensions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade on the index probably wasn&#8217;t a one-way bet, the
market participants said. Iksil may have offset it by buying
protection on the same index with contracts that expire about
seven months from now, the people said. That strategy would pay
JPMorgan the difference between the long-dated contracts and the
short-dated ones, and the trade would gain when the gap narrows.
The hedge would end in December unless another trade is made to
replace it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satyajit Das, the author of &#8220;Extreme Money: Masters of the
Universe and the Cult of Risk,&#8221; compared the publicity around
JPMorgan&#8217;s situation to losses that spiraled at hedge funds like
Long-Term Capital Management in 1998 and Amaranth Advisors LLC
in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A $2 billion loss suggests a position of considerable
size,&#8221; Das said. &#8220;I think you remember LTCM and a few other
people like Amaranth that have had the exact same problem and
have learned it&#8217;s a bit like hell -- easy to get into, not so
easy to get out of.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Derivatives traders seeking to profit
on speculation JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is unwinding positions tied
to its $2 billion trading loss are driving up a vintage credit-default swaps index to the highest in more than three months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10-year Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index
Series 9, created in 2007, reached as high as 138.8 basis points
today before easing to 137.9 as of 3:17 p.m. in New York,
according to data provider CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc.
and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market. The index ended yesterday at 126.7 and has
climbed from 111.7 on March 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traders are pushing the index wider as they wager it&#8217;s one
of the bank&#8217;s biggest positions contributing to the loss,
revealed late yesterday by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon
on a conference call with analysts. Some trading firms seek to
profit from dislocations rather than bets on which way a market
is headed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $2 billion loss occurred in London under multiple

activities since last month, according to a person briefed on
the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commodity Futures Trading Commission hasn&#8217;t opened an
enforcement action against the bank, according to the person,
who spoke on condition of anonymity because the review is
private. JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said
yesterday that the firm suffered a $2 billion loss from trading
credit derivatives, which he attributed to &#8220;egregious&#8221;
failures in a unit managing risks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada&#8217;s dollar is poised to rally
against its U.S. counterpart after failing to depreciate through
a pivotal price level, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inability of the currency to close weaker than C$1.0055
per dollar twice this week, after reaching C$1.0063 on an
intraday basis on May 9, signals it will strengthen, Niall O&#8217;Connor, a technical analyst at the firm, wrote in a client
note. Canada&#8217;s dollar, nicknamed the loonie, has strengthened
2.4 percent against the U.S. currency this year after losing 2.3
percent in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Canada has held important levels for the second time this
week, suggesting that a deeper pullback in the move is ready to
develop,&#8221; New York-based O&#8217;Connor said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;Canada is exhibiting bullish economic fundamentals
relative to the U.S. and commodity currencies that are giving it
safe-haven status.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Canadian currency gained today versus most of its major
peers after employment in the nation climbed in April by 58,200
jobs, almost six times faster than economists forecast. The
loonie strengthened 0.3 percent to 99.89 cents per U.S. dollar
after weakening as much as 0.3 percent earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the currency appreciates beyond 99.25 cents, it will
probably gain even further, O&#8217;Connor said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gulf Coast gasoline rose versus
futures as Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) shut a hydrocracker at its Beaumont
refinery in Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit was closed after a recycle compressor tripped at
the plant, according to a filing late yesterday with the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discount for regular, 87-octane gasoline in the Gulf
Coast narrowed 0.62 cent to 17.13 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 12:09 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery fell
0.52 cent to $2.8275 a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planned maintenance is under way at the Phillips 66
refinery in Borger, Texas, Rich Johnson, a Houston-based
spokesman for the company, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same fuel in Chicago strengthened 6 cents to a discount
of 3 cents versus futures. It is the highest level since May 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citgo Petroleum Corp. released sulfur dioxide to a flare
after a mechanical failure at its refinery in Lemont, Illinois,
according to a filing with the National Response Center. The
release at 7:30 p.m. local time yesterday wasn&#8217;t secured, the
filing showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plant had a release of an unknown amount of natural gas
and propane from a flare after a &#8220;power blip,&#8221; according to a

&lt;p&gt;Six banks, including JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) and Bank of America Corp., have formed a group designed to
facilitate foreign-exchange market trading for institutional
clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FXSpotStream LLC, a subsidiary of LiquidityMatch LLC, was
started in the U.S. April 30, Chief Executive Officer Alan F.
Schwarz confirmed in a telephone interview. The company will
provide a currency-price aggregation service to the clients of
Bank of America, Citigroup Inc., Commerzbank AG, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc and JPMorgan. The banks are
majority shareholders in FXSpotStream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Clients access a single interface from co-location sites
in New York, London and Tokyo and have the potential to
communicate with all liquidity-providing banks connected to the
FXSpotStream solution,&#8221; Schwarz said in a release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The service will begin June 1 in Europe and Aug. 31 in
Asia, he said. It will not charge brokerage fees to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;SpotStream is another market utility and it&#8217;s a means for
us to efficiently connect with our clients and continue to
maintain bilateral relationships,&#8221; Richard Anthony, global head
of foreign-exchange electronic risk at HSBC in London, said in a
telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fergal Walsh, co-head of foreign-exchange electronic
trading at Citigroup in New York, said the service would
eliminate brokerage fees often paid by banks when a third party
is involved in transactions with clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are in an extremely competitive market now, our
spreads are incredibly tight, and broker costs can make up a
significant part of our margins,&#8221; Walsh said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;In an effort to control those, and also give a more
efficient service to our clients, we are happy to participate in
this solution.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s never polite to say I told you
so, but JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s $2 billion trading loss has
proponents of a tougher proprietary trading ban saying . . .
well, you know what. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s admission is a shocker. The bank said the losses
resulted from errors, sloppiness and bad judgment, which top
bank executives didn&#8217;t know about or understand until it was too
late. On Wall Street and around the globe, JPMorgan was a
standard-setter for risk management. If regulators can&#8217;t trust
JPMorgan to get it right, whom can they trust? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Volcker rule, part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform
law, was inspired by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. It&#8217;s supposed to stop federally insured banks from
making speculative bets for their own profit -- leaving
taxpayers to bail them out when things go wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have said, banks have both explicit and implicit
federal guarantees, so the market doesn&#8217;t impose the same
discipline on them as, say, hedge funds. For this reason, the
Volcker rule should be as airtight as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The huge trading positions taken by the London branch of
JPMorgan&#8217;s chief investment office certainly drive home the
point. As first reported by Bloomberg News, the investment
office, operating much like a hedge fund, built a position that
may have totaled $100 billion in a credit-derivative index known
as the CDX, which tracks the default risk of a basket of
companies. Those are the positions that blew up. They could
ultimately cost the bank much more than $2 billion now that the
market knows they are being unwound. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Skewed Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although their precise size and purpose aren&#8217;t known, the
trades -- bets that companies in the index wouldn&#8217;t default on
loans -- caused distortions in a $10 trillion market. For a
while, the price of the index actually diverged from the price
of default insurance on the individual companies underlying it.
The skewed values adversely affected investors and others who
relied on the instrument to hedge hundreds of billions of
dollars of bond holdings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blowup is stirring debate among U.S. policy makers
wrangling over the Volcker rule, complicating the job of
JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, who is leading the
industry charge against the rule. Dimon at first sought to
downplay all the fuss as a &#8220;complete tempest in a teapot.&#8221; It
was Dimon who transformed the investment office in recent years
to make bigger and riskier speculative trades with the bank&#8217;s
money, Bloomberg reported. One sign that the unit may have been
doing more than hedging could be seen in its daily trading risk
-- it was about the same as JPMorgan&#8217;s entire investment bank,
which includes Wall Street&#8217;s biggest stock-trading and bond-
trading units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In truth, the London trades fall into a gray zone in the
Dodd-Frank law. The act gives regulators discretion to exempt
&#8220;risk-mitigating hedging activities&#8221; for &#8220;individual or
aggregated positions&#8221; from the proprietary trading ban.
JPMorgan still argues that it was following the letter of the
law because its trades were meant to hedge the bank&#8217;s overall
portfolio risk. If the Federal Reserve and other bank regulators
agree, and write a Volcker rule that allows such broad-based
hedging to continue, they risk a systemic failure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank executives have an incentive to mask proprietary
trading as hedging or as market-making -- another activity the
Volcker rule permits. After all, taking large speculative
positions in derivatives markets is a tempting shortcut to
profits and bonuses. Almost any trade by a large bank could be
made to look like a hedge -- and regulators would be hard-
pressed to prove otherwise. As JPMorgan has now shown, giant
trading positions can backfire as easily as they can pay off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We urge regulators not to view such portfolio-hedging
trades as benign. The final Volcker rule, which could come as
early as this summer but won&#8217;t be enforced for two more years,
should require banks to put stricter boundaries around trading
activity with a risk profile that includes estimates of losses
under various worst-case scenarios. Regulators should approve
these profiles and have the ability to monitor compliance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;True Market Making &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators also must not let banks continue to do prop
trading under the guise of market making. One solution is to
look at how long a trading desk has been holding its inventory
of securities. The average for a big market-making operation
should be a matter of days. And regulators could look at the
percentage of trades a desk makes with clients, versus with
other securities dealers. If most trades are with customers, the
bank is probably doing true market making. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overseas regulators are considering alternative approaches
that could work just as well, so long as the end-goal is to
limit proprietary trading. The U.K. allows banks to conduct prop
trading as long as they split their banking and securities
activities into independent, separately capitalized entities, an
approach known as ring-fencing. The European Union is also
considering requiring risk profiles as well as higher capital
requirements for securities that aren&#8217;t easily sold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks say these rules will impair their ability to act as
market makers in service to clients, harm liquidity in bond
markets, and impose costs that will reduce lending and slow the
economy. What banks don&#8217;t mention is that depositors&#8217; money will
be safer, taxpayers won&#8217;t have to bail out big banks that suffer
large trading losses, and financial crises and recessions may
occur less often. That&#8217;s a lot of upside. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;German stocks advanced, with the
benchmark DAX (DAX) Index erasing its weekly losses, after a report
showed U.S. consumer confidence rose to a four-year high in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW), Daimler AG (DAI) and Volkswagen AG (VOW),
the three biggest makers of luxury cars, rallied more than 2
percent. Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) fell as much as 3.7 percent after
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) posted a $2 billion trading loss and pared
the decline late in the session. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DAX gained 1 percent to 6,579.93 at the close in
Frankfurt, reversing an earlier decline of as much as 1 percent.
The gauge added 0.3 percent this week even as Greek politicians
struggled to form a government after inconclusive elections. The
broader HDAX Index rose 0.9 percent today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Greece has become less of a factor as the real contagion
risk seems limited.&#8221; said Henrik Henriksen, the chief
investment strategist at PFA Pension A/S in Copenhagen, where he
helps manage $45 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., consumer confidence rose in May to the highest
level in four years, indicating falling fuel costs are helping
households look past weaker employment growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
index of consumer sentiment climbed to 77.8, the highest since
January 2008, from 76.4 the prior month. The gauge was projected
to drop to 76, according to the median forecast of 68 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Greek Political Impasse &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greece&#8217;s politicians continued their attempt to form a
unity government after Evangelos Venizelos, the socialist Pasok
leader, received a mandate from the nation&#8217;s president. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impasse has renewed concerns that Greece may fail to
comply with the terms of its two bailouts negotiated since May
2010 and leave the euro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Antonis Samaras, leader of Greece&#8217;s New
Democracy party, said he supports a unity government under the
sole condition that it guarantees the nation&#8217;s membership of the
euro area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross domestic product in the 17-nation euro area will drop
0.3 percent, the European Commission said today, reiterating a
February forecast. Greece will have the deepest contraction,
with GDP declining 4.7 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spain and Italy will shrink 1.8 percent and 1.4 percent,
respectively, the commission said. In 2013, the euro-region
economy may expand 1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spanish Property Loans &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks earlier dropped after Spain said it will force the
country&#8217;s banks to increase provisions against losses on real-estate loans by 30 billion euros ($38 billion) and will hire two
auditors to gauge all the assets of lenders in the government&#8217;s
fourth attempt to clean up the financial system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In China, a report showed that the country&#8217;s industrial
output rose 9.3 percent in April from a year earlier. That
compared with the 12.2 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey of 32 economists and 11.9 percent in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said the firm
suffered the loss after an &#8220;egregious&#8221; failure in a unit
managing risks. The firm&#8217;s chief investment office, run by Ina
Drew, 55, took positions on synthetic credit securities that may
cost an additional $1 billion this quarter or next, Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. lawmakers and interest groups favoring tighter
restrictions on proprietary trading said JPMorgan&#8217;s errors
bolster their case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BMW rose 2.1 percent to 67.60 euros. The carmaker said it
will open more used-car centers in China to build the brand and
expand its customer base in the world&#8217;s largest auto market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daimler, the maker of Mercedes sports sedans, and
Volkswagen AG, Europe&#8217;s biggest carmaker, climbed 2.3 percent to
39.23 euros and 2.2 percent to 137.40 euros, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank lost 0.2 percent to 31.17 euros. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Securities and Exchange

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Investment
Officer Ina R. Drew, head of the unit responsible for a $2
billion trading loss, built a 30-year career at the largest U.S.
bank by embracing risk and avoiding the spotlight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With everything she does, she thinks in terms of
trading,&#8221; said Stephen Murray, head of CCMP Capital Advisors
LLC, created from a JPMorgan private-equity unit in 2006.
&#8220;There are risk-lovers, there are risk-haters, and the best
traders will take the risk as long as they get paid for it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drew&#8217;s operation, which helps manage the bank&#8217;s risk, has
been transformed under Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon to
make bigger speculative bets with the firm&#8217;s own money,
according to five former employees, Bloomberg News reported last
month. Some bets were so big JPMorgan probably couldn&#8217;t unwind
them without roiling markets, the former executives said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loss disclosed yesterday came after an &#8220;egregious&#8221;
investment-office failure tied to credit derivatives, Dimon said
in a conference call. &#8220;In hindsight, the new strategy was
flawed, complex, poorly reviewed, poorly executed and poorly
monitored.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drew, 55, is one of two women who sit on the New York-based
firm&#8217;s operating committee. Her office oversees about $360
billion, the difference between money from deposits and what the
bank extends in loans. Dimon, 56, had pushed the unit to boost
profit by buying higher-yielding assets, including structured
credit, equities and derivatives, two former employees have
said. The shift to riskier bets underscores how blurry the line
can be between so-called proprietary trading and what banks say
is hedging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chemical Bank &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drew has overseen both kinds at the firm for decades. She
joined Chemical Banking Corp. in 1982 after graduating from
Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and receiving a master&#8217;s
degree from Columbia University&#8217;s School of International
Affairs, according to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Chemical merged with Manufacturers Hanover Corp. in
1991, Drew was put in charge of managing U.S. interest-rate
risks and given oversight of discretionary trading positions,
according to a news release that year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ina was all about risk-taking,&#8221; said Mark Schneiderman,
a former human resources manager at Chemical. &#8220;She was scary-
smart, she was very determined, she was very low-key compared to
the crazies that you find on a trading floor -- but very, very
determined.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petros Sabatacakis, a former chief risk officer for
Citigroup Inc. and now a director of the National Bank of Greece
SA (ETE), said he promoted her at Chemical. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diageo Plc (DGE), the world&#8217;s biggest
distiller, and computer-services provider International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM) led $27.6 billion of corporate bond sales in the
U.S. this week as relative yields on investment-grade debt rose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diageo, the seller of Johnnie Walker Scotch whisky and
Guinness beer, raised $2.5 billion in a three-part offering and
Armonk, New York-based IBM sold $1.5 billion of debt, including
seven-year notes at a record-low coupon, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales for the week compare with $32.6
billion in the period ended May 4 and a weekly 2012 average of
$30.1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM and Diageo were joined by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/B) in
tapping the bond market, showing investor appetite for the most
creditworthy corporate borrowers even as political turmoil in
Europe threatened to unravel the region&#8217;s common currency and
disrupt the financial system. Yields on investment-grade debt in
the U.S. touched an all-time low this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In a world of dwindling quality debt instruments, there&#8217;s
going to be demand for the IBMs and the Berkshires of the world,
and for other high-quality issuers,&#8221; Anthony Valeri, a market
strategist in San Diego at LPL Financial, which oversees about
$330 billion, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to hold investment-grade
corporate bonds rather than government debentures increased as
spreads rose 3 basis points to 203 basis points, or 2.03
percentage points, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch&#8217;s
U.S. Corporate Master index. Yields fell as low as 3.33 percent
on May 8 before rising to 3.35 percent yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Europe Crisis &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of investment-grade bonds fell to $22.3 billion this
week from $26.8 billion in the period ended May 4, the most in
seven weeks, Bloomberg data show. Sales compare with a weekly
average this year of $23.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investor concern is mounting that European policymakers
will fail to stem the region&#8217;s debt crisis after France elected
socialist leader Francois Hollande and Greece&#8217;s elections ended
with inconclusive results on May 6. Speculation has since risen
over whether Greece will exit the euro zone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., consumer borrowing surged in March by $21.4
billion, the biggest gain since November 2001, to $2.54
trillion, Federal Reserve figures showed May 7 in Washington.
The advance was paced by a $16.2 billion jump in non-revolving
debt, including student and car loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Diageo, IBM &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diageo sold $1 billion each of five- and 10-year notes and
$500 million of 30-year bonds, Bloomberg data show. The 4.25
percent debt due in May 2042 yielded 125 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diageo spokeswoman Kirsty King declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM sold $900 million of 0.75 percent, three-year notes at
a relative yield of 45 basis points, and $600 million of seven-year bonds at a record low 1.875 percent and a 65 basis-point
spread, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proceeds from the issue &#8220;will be used for general
corporate purposes, which could include refinancing long-term
maturities and commercial paper, or funding acquisitions,&#8221; said
Doug Shelton, a spokesman for IBM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire, run by 81-year old billionaire Warren Buffett,
issued $1.6 billion of bonds and China Petrochemical Corp.,
known as Sinopec, sold $3 billion in its first dollar-denominated issue since 1996, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a request for
comment, sent to Buffett&#8217;s assistant Carrie Kizer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford Motor Co. (F) sold $1.25 billion of bonds two weeks after
Fitch Ratings raised the automaker&#8217;s credit ranking to
investment grade. Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and Standard 
Poor&#8217;s still rate the Dearborn, Michigan-based carmaker as junk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margaret Mellott, a spokeswoman for Ford, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a phone call or e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;High-Yield Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of speculative-grade or high-yield bonds, graded
below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s and lower than BBB- at SP, fell to $5.3
billion from $5.7 billion last week, Bloomberg data show.
Speculative-grade relative yields versus Treasuries widened to
600 basis points yesterday from 594 basis points on May 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dish Network Corp. (DISH), the second-largest U.S. satellite-television provider to DirecTV, issued $1.9 billion of bonds to
help refinance debt coming due in 2013 and 2014. The sale was
increased from $1.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s still a pretty attractive place to issue for
corporates,&#8221; said Bradley Rogoff, head of global credit
strategy at Barclays Capital, in an interview on Bloomberg
Television&#8217;s &#8220;InsideTrack&#8221; with Stephanie Ruhle. &#8220;Going
forward, I think if we see some volatility but we reset at a
slightly higher yield, you&#8217;ll still see a decent amount of
issuance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among planned issues is $1 billion from Inmet Mining Corp.,
the Toronto-based mining company, and $450 million from coal
producer Penn Virginia Resource Partners LP, according to
Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rand slumped to its lowest level
in almost four months, set for its worst weekly decline this
year, as political turmoil in Greece and a $2 billion trading
loss at JPMorgan Chase  Co. roiled financial markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Africa&#8217;s currency fell as much as 1.4 percent to
8.1272 per dollar, the weakest since Jan. 16. It traded 1.1
percent down at 8.1071 as of 3:34 p.m. in Johannesburg, bringing
its retreat this week to 3.6 percent. The yield on the nation&#8217;s
6.75 percent bonds due 2021 rose three basis points, or 0.03
percentage points, to 7.73 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greek political leaders enter a fifth day of talks to form
a government as the European Commission said the euro-region
economy will likely contract 0.3 percent this year. The 17-nation group buys 22 percent of South Africa&#8217;s exports. Stocks
and commodities tumbled after JPMorgan said &#8220;grievous
mistakes&#8221; and &#8220;sloppiness&#8221; caused the surprise loss on
synthetic credit securities, underscoring risks to global
financial markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With risk aversion in the air, the traditional rush to
safe havens has lifted the dollar and seen the rand weaken to
more than 8 per dollar,&#8221; Nomvuyo Guma, a currency strategist at
Standard Bank Group Ltd. in Johannesburg, said in e-mailed
comments. &#8220;The prevailing uncertainty will continue to weigh on
the euro and other risky assets, while continuing to lend
support to the dollar. Therefore, the rand&#8217;s weakening bias will
persist into the weekend.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Commodities Slide &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI Index (SPGSCI) of raw materials fell for
an eighth day and the MSCI index of emerging-market stocks
dropped to the lowest level since January 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Africa&#8217;s benchmark stock index declined as commodity
producers including Anglo American Plc and BHP Billiton Ltd.
slumped. Metals and other raw materials account for 45 percent
of South Africa&#8217;s exports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greece&#8217;s political impasse has raised the possibility
another election will have to be held as early as next month,
threatening the implementation of austerity pledges. The
standoff has reignited European concerns over Greece&#8217;s ability
to hold to the terms of its two bailouts negotiated since May
2010 and sparked speculation about the country leaving the euro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said the $2
billion loss came after an &#8220;egregious&#8221; failure in its chief
investment office. Global stocks extended losses after
industrial production in China missed analysts&#8217; estimates in
April, while data showed India&#8217;s production at factories,
utilities and mines declined in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Markets look under pressure,&#8221; John Cairns and Josina Solomons, analysts at Johannesburg-based Rand Merchant Bank,
said in e-mailed comments. The Greek turmoil and JPMorgan&#8217;s
losses are both &#8220;negatives for the rand&#8221;, they added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rand&#8217;s three-month implied volatility against the
dollar rose to 15.5 percent today, the highest since April 18,
as options traders anticipate wider swings in the currency in
coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of insuring the nation&#8217;s dollar-denominated
sovereign debt against default climbed 2.5 basis points to 161.5
basis points, the most since April 24, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

Moore and Christine Harper" date="May 11, 2012  9:08 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-11/jpmorgan-loses-2-billion-on-unit-s-egregious-mistakes-.html"><headline>JPMorgan Loses $2 Billion on Unit&#8217;s &#8216;Egregious Mistakes&#8217;</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon said the firm suffered a $2 billion trading
loss after an &#8220;egregious&#8221; failure in a unit managing risks,
jeopardizing Wall Street banks&#8217; efforts to loosen a federal ban
on bets with their own money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s chief investment office, run by Ina Drew, 55,
took flawed positions on synthetic credit securities that remain
volatile and may cost an additional $1 billion this quarter or
next, Dimon told analysts yesterday. Losses mounted as JPMorgan
tried to mitigate transactions designed to hedge credit
exposure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There were many errors, sloppiness and bad judgment,&#8221;
Dimon said as the company&#8217;s stock fell in extended trading.
&#8220;These were egregious mistakes, they were self-inflicted.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chief investment office was thrust into the debate over
U.S. efforts to ban proprietary trading when Bloomberg News
reported last month that the unit had taken bets so big that
JPMorgan, the largest and most profitable U.S. bank, probably
couldn&#8217;t unwind them without losing money or roiling financial
markets. Dimon, 56, had transformed the unit in recent years to
make bigger and riskier speculative trades with the bank&#8217;s
money, five former employees said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;FSA Examination &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K.&#8217;s Financial Services Authority, which regulates
banks, is examining the role London employees played in the
loss, according to two people familiar with the talks. The
agency hasn&#8217;t opened a formal investigation and there was no
evidence of criminal activity, these people said. The loss
originated out of the firm&#8217;s London CIO unit, an executive at
the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think it will weigh on the sector pretty bad,&#8221; said
Paul Miller, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets in Arlington,
Virginia. Miller and Christopher Mutascio at Stifel Nicolaus 
Co. downgraded their recommendations on the shares today.
&#8220;Investors are going to say that these are general big black
boxes that can&#8217;t be analyzed, not even the management companies
understand what they&#8217;re doing themselves.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon had defended the Chief Investment Office as a
&#8220;sophisticated&#8221; guardian of the bank&#8217;s funds on an April 13
conference call, calling news coverage &#8220;a complete tempest in a
teapot.&#8221; On May 2, he led fellow Wall Street CEOs in a closed-
door meeting to lobby the Federal Reserve about softening
proposed U.S. reforms that might crimp their profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Bunch of Pundits&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, he said the timing of the trading blunders
&#8220;plays right into the hands of a bunch of pundits out there&#8221;
who are pushing for a strict version of the proprietary trading
ban named for former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given Dimon&#8217;s resistance to the ban and new regulations,
&#8220;he&#8217;s got a lot of egg on his face right now,&#8221; said Craig Pirrong, a finance professor at the University of Houston. &#8220;Any
chance they had of getting a relative loosening of Volcker rule,
anything of that nature, that&#8217;s out the window.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chief investment office&#8217;s push into risk-taking was led
by Achilles Macris, 50, according to three former employees,
Bloomberg News reported on April 13. He was hired in 2006 as its
top executive in London and led an expansion into corporate and
mortgage-debt investments with a mandate to generate profits for
the New York-based bank, they said. Dimon closely supervised the
transition from its previous focus on protecting JPMorgan from
risks inherent in its banking business, such as interest-rate
and currency movements, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Talented People&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t call it &#8216;more aggressive,&#8217; I would call it
&#8216;better,&#8217;&#8221; Dimon told analysts yesterday. &#8220;We added different
types of people, talented people and stuff like that.&#8221; Until
recently, they were careful and successful, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s classic Wall Street hubris, which we&#8217;ve seen so many
times before,&#8221; said Simon Johnson, a former chief economist at
the International Monetary Fund who now teaches at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. &#8220;What&#8217;s particularly
ironic here is that Jamie presents himself, and is believed by
others to be, the king of risk management.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News first reported April 5 that London-based
JPMorgan trader Bruno Iksil had amassed positions linked to the
financial health of corporations that were so large he was
driving price moves in the $10 trillion market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $2 billion loss occurred in London under multiple
traders, according to an executive at the bank, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. Dimon wasn&#8217;t immediately told about
their shift in strategy and didn&#8217;t know the magnitude of the
losses until after the company reported earnings April 13, the
executive said. As the position deteriorated rapidly, the bank
gathered internal analysts and examiners to investigate, and
Dimon grew more distressed by the day, the executive said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Corrective Actions&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While no one has been fired yet, Dimon told analysts he
will take &#8220;corrective actions.&#8221; The bank is keeping employees
involved on hand while it deals with the transactions, and some
are likely to lose their jobs afterward, said an executive with
knowledge of the situation. The bank is also reevaluating its
risk-monitoring team within the chief investment office, the
person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan risks losing more money now because other market
participants will figure out what the bank has to do to unload
its position, said Charles Peabody, an analyst with Portales
Partners LLC in New York. Costs from the trades may affect
earnings through the end of the year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sharks to Blood &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When there&#8217;s blood in the water, the sharks are going to
attack that animal,&#8221; said Peabody, who downgraded his
recommendation on the stock in March to sector perform. &#8220;It
could make it very difficult for them to unwind a trade.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares, which closed at $40.74 yesterday, fell 8.4
percent to $37.30 at 8:52 a.m. in New York trading. The stock
had advanced 23 percent this year before the losses were
disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of insuring debt of JPMorgan from default rose.
Credit-default swaps insuring JPMorgan&#8217;s debt climbed 17 basis
points to 124, the highest since Feb. 16, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is equivalent to a
hundredth of a percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds of JPMorgan declined the most in six months, widening
the gap in yield between the lender&#8217;s $6 billion of undated 7.9
percent junior subordinated notes and the 0.875 percent Treasury
due 2018 by 16 basis points to 392.2 basis points, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices at 10:10 a.m. in London. The price
of the note, callable in 2018, fell 2.2 cents on the dollar to
107.84 cents, pushing up the yield to 6.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Credit Risks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon declined on the call to discuss the specific
transactions or people involved. Synthetic credit products are
derivatives that generate gains and losses tied to credit
performance without the owner buying or selling actual debt.
JPMorgan used the instruments to hedge exposure on loans and
other credit risks to corporations, banks and sovereign
governments. The losses emerged after the firm tried to reduce
that position and unwind the portfolio, Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank said losses were partly offset by gains from the
sales from its available-for-sale credit portfolio, resulting in
a net loss for the firm&#8217;s corporate division, which includes the
CIO, of about $800 million after taxes. Dimon said losses could
widen or narrow in coming weeks and months, and that he can&#8217;t
estimate potential costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Confirming Fears &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the bank repositions the synthetic credit portfolio, the
chief investment office &#8220;may hold certain of its current
synthetic credit positions for the longer term,&#8221; the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Hopefully, this will not be an issue by the end of the
year, but it does depend on the decisions and the markets,&#8221;
Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also changed how it calculates so-called value at
risk, or VAR, a measure of how much the company estimates it
could lose on securities on 95 percent of days. The company
restated its VAR for the first quarter, previously disclosed at
$67 million, at $129 million. The bank used a new model for
calculating its trading risk in the first quarter that Dimon
said was &#8220;inadequate.&#8221; It is reverting to the old model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a major event that confirms a lot of investors&#8217;
worst fears about bank risk,&#8221; said Frank Partnoy, a former
derivatives trader who&#8217;s now a law and finance professor at the
University of San Diego. Concern is &#8220;that at a large,
supposedly sophisticated institution, even something called a
&#8216;hedge&#8217; can contain all kinds of hidden risks that the senior
people don&#8217;t understand.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Difficult Exit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iksil may have amassed a $100 billion position in contracts
on Series 9 of the Markit CDX North America Investment Grade
Index, counterparts at hedge funds and rival banks said in
April. They based their estimates on the trades and price
movements they witnessed as well as their understanding of the
size and structure of the markets. The positions amounted to
tens of billions of dollars, under the firm&#8217;s own math, a person
familiar with its view said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade on the index probably wasn&#8217;t a one-way bet, the
market participants said. Iksil may have offset it by buying
protection on the same index with contracts that expire about
seven months from now, the people said. That strategy would pay
JPMorgan the difference between the long-dated contracts and the
short-dated ones, and the trade would gain when the gap narrows.
The hedge would end in December unless another trade is made to
replace it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satyajit Das, the author of &#8220;Extreme Money: Masters of the
Universe and the Cult of Risk,&#8221; compared the publicity around
JPMorgan&#8217;s situation to losses that spiraled at hedge funds like
Long-Term Capital Management in 1998 and Amaranth Advisors LLC
in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A $2 billion loss suggests a position of considerable
size,&#8221; Das said. &#8220;I think you remember LTCM and a few other
people like Amaranth that have had the exact same problem and
have learned it&#8217;s a bit like hell -- easy to get into, not so
easy to get out of.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A gauge of corporate credit risk rose
to the highest level in more than three months after JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) reported a $2 billion dollar trading loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, added 2 basis points to a mid-price of 106.1
basis points at 8:44 a.m. in New York, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The swaps index climbed as JPMorgan&#8217;s Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon said an &#8220;egregious&#8221; failure on its
synthetic credit securities led to losses in its chief
investment office. The positions may cost an additional $1
billion this quarter or next, he told analysts yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The credit-default swaps measure, which typically rises as
investor confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves, last
closed at a higher level on Jan 19 at 108.1 basis points. The
contracts pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet
its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis
point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European Union governments have
scrapped plans for finance ministers to thrash out an accord
next week on tougher rules for credit ratings companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diplomats from the region&#8217;s 27 nations decided yesterday
that more talks are needed by officials on the draft law before
it can be agreed on by finance ministers, said an EU official. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The draft law has been taken off the agenda of a meeting of
finance ministers on May 15, said the official, who can&#8217;t be
identified in line with EU policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michel Barnier, the European Union&#8217;s financial services
chief, proposed last year to force businesses to rotate the
credit ratings companies they use. Barnier has said the measure
would boost competition and address conflicts of interest.
Regulators and industry have warned that the step could reduce
the quality of ratings in the short term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measure is part of a broader draft law presented by
Barnier which would also allow investors to sue ratings
companies in cases of misconduct or gross negligence, and give
the European Securities and Markets Authority increased
oversight powers over the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governments reached an agreement in March to scale back the
rotation plans, without settling the details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denmark, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU, has
proposed limiting rotation so that it only covers ratings of
securitizations and other so-called structured finance
instruments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National diplomats are weighing whether to scale back the
measures further so that rotation would apply only to so-called
resecuritizations, such as collateralized debt obligations that
are repackaged and used to back another round of securitized
debt, the official said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The credit-ratings law requires approval by national
governments and by lawmakers in the European Parliament, before
it can come into effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Martin Currie Fined by SEC, U.K. FSA for Client Manipulation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Currie Investment Management Ltd., an Edinburgh-based fund management group, was fined about $14 million by
finance regulators in the U.S. and U.K. for manipulating a
client to aid a hedge fund the firm managed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged Martin
Currie Investment Management Ltd. and Martin Currie Inc. with
advising The China Fund Inc. (CHN) to invest in its struggling hedge
fund with a &#8220;largely illiquid exposure&#8221; to a Chinese company,
the regulator said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The misconduct in this case strikes at the heart of the
fiduciary relationship between an investment adviser and its
client,&#8221; said Robert Khuzami, SEC enforcement director, in the
agency&#8217;s statement. The SEC investigation into individuals is
continuing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Currie settled the charges with the SEC for $8.3
million and was fined 3.5 million pounds ($5.7 million) by the
U.K. Financial Services Authority. It is the largest fine levied
by the FSA for failing to manage a conflict of interest, the
British regulator said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it disclosed the conflict of interest in July, Martin
Currie&#8217;s assets under management have fallen to about 5 billion
pounds, according to its website, compared with 10.1 billion
pounds in mid-2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm gave preferential treatment to its client, the
Martin Currie China Hedge Fund LP, which had invested heavily in
a Chinese printer-cartridge recycling company, Jackin
International Holdings, and was facing increasing requests for
redemptions from its investors, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Currie&#8217;s unlisted investments division has now been
closed, the firm said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The FSA and SEC investigations related to historic
investments in a series of three unlisted bonds, the first of
which took place five years ago,&#8221; the firm said. &#8220;Those
investments gave rise to a conflict of interest between two
client accounts, which also exposed certain weaknesses in Martin
Currie&#8217;s systems and controls.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm said it compensated the client and returned all
related fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Currie&#8217;s directors and external shareholders have
also invested about 25 million pounds in the company, which gave
it more than 300 percent of its regulatory capital requirement,
the money manager said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CFTC Votes to Finish Dodd-Frank Derivatives Exchange Rules &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission voted to
require swaps exchanges to have pauses and halts in trading and
abide by other restrictions to limit market risks under final
Dodd-Frank Act regulations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency voted 5-0 yesterday to complete a series of
rules, including record-keeping and reporting requirements, that
will apply to exchanges. The agency intends many of the
regulations to be flexible guidelines for compliance instead of
prescriptive rules, according to a CFTC summary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These exchanges for the first time will be able to list
and trade swaps to bring the benefit of pre-trade
transparency,&#8221; Gary Gensler, the agency&#8217;s chairman said before
the vote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dodd-Frank, the financial-regulation overhaul enacted in
2010, seeks to have most swaps traded on exchanges or other so-called swap execution facilities, governed by separate rules yet
to be completed. The rules are intended to increase transparency
in the $708 trillion global swaps market after largely
unregulated swaps helped fuel the 2008 credit crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency delayed a final vote on the most controversial
element of the rules governing exchanges, a restriction on the
amount of trading that must occur in a centralized market. The
agency postponed a vote on the provision amid internal dissent
and opposition from CME Group Inc. (CME), owner of the world&#8217;s largest
futures exchange. &#8220;The commission will be best served by
continued dialog,&#8221; said Mark Wetjen, a Democratic commissioner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Obama&#8217;s Regulation-Killing to Save $6 Billion in Five Years &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. rule changes involving street signs, train control
systems and hospital practices will save consumers and
businesses almost $6 billion in the next five years, President
Barack Obama&#8217;s administration said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The savings is a large part of the annual cost of
rulemaking, said Cass Sunstein, administrator of the White House
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, in announcing the
reforms yesterday at an American Bar Association meeting in
Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s a significant chunk of the total costs of
rulemaking in any given year and we have on one day taken away
that cost,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republicans have criticized some regulations Obama issued
as too burdensome on business and made a campaign issue of his
rule-making approach. Some of yesterday&#8217;s changes, including
rules for vapor-recovery systems at gasoline stations, a partial
exemption from installing railroad crash-avoidance technology,
and streamlined health-care reporting, were disclosed last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;ve already taken credit for this,&#8221; said James
Gattuso, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Heritage
Foundation, which says it advocates conservative political
positions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Big Four Auditors Welcome China&#8217;s Rule to Localize Their Firms &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the biggest global auditing firms are accepting a
new directive from China to staff their operations with Chinese
citizens, saying they are already trending that way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within three years, all senior partners for auditors&#8217;
operations in China must be Chinese citizens with local
accountant certifications, according to rules posted on the
website of China&#8217;s Ministry of Finance May 9. Two of the so-called Big Four auditing firms, whose U.S. affiliates are Ernst
 Young LLP and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, said they support
the move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our business is well-positioned for this transition,&#8221;
Ernst  Young said in a statement. &#8220;The new measures are in
line with EY&#8217;s existing strategy to accelerate localization of
our business in China.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China drew particular attention last year as dozens of
Chinese companies disclosed auditor resignations or accounting
irregularities, leading to the suspension or delisting of their
shares. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the
auditor watchdog group it supervises have met repeatedly with
Chinese counterparts to discuss lifting barriers for inspectors
to review auditors of U.S.-listed companies in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PwC China, the local affiliate of PricewaterhouseCoopers,
said in a statement that it has been &#8220;actively localizing its
China practice by investing heavily in developing local talent
and promoting local partners in past years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colleen Brennan, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board that oversees auditors, declined to
immediately comment on the rules. Deloitte LLP and KPMG LLP, the
remaining members of the Big Four, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to
requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC sued Shanghai-based Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu CPA
Ltd., the agency said May 9, alleging that the firm refused to
provide documents related to a China-based company under
investigation for potential accounting fraud against U.S.
investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Filings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goldman Lifts &#8216;Reasonably Possible&#8217; Legal-Loss Estimate 13% &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by
assets, raised estimates of potential losses from legal claims
by 13 percent and said a probe into its handling of Greek
finances includes trading and research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forecast of &#8220;reasonably possible&#8221; legal costs rose to
$2.7 billion as of March 31 from $2.4 billion three months
earlier, according to a regulatory filing yesterday. The New
York-based firm didn&#8217;t give specific reasons for the increase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks started releasing estimates of possible losses after
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission told finance chiefs
in October 2010 that they should disclose such costs &#8220;when
there is at least a reasonable possibility&#8221; they may be
incurred, even if the risk is too low to require reserves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estimate doesn&#8217;t include potential losses from legal
matters that are at an early stage or where the firm can&#8217;t
determine the potential amount, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An investigation of the firm&#8217;s financing and swap
transactions with the Greek government, which started about two
years ago, also includes &#8220;trading and research activities with
respect to Greek sovereign debt,&#8221; according to the filing.
&#8220;Goldman Sachs has cooperated with the investigations and
reviews,&#8221; the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also disclosed that the U.S. Department of
Justice and SEC are investigating the firm&#8217;s role in the 2008
financial crisis. Those inquiries stem from last year&#8217;s report
by the Senate&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which
said the firm misled clients about mortgage-related investments
before the crisis. Goldman Sachs has denied wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is in arbitration with a California school
district and the cities of Houston, Texas, and Reno, Nevada,
over Goldman Sachs&#8217;s role as an underwriter and broker-dealer
for more than $1.7 billion in auction-rate securities from 2004
and 2007, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is also facing a suit from the founders and
majority shareholders of Dragon Systems Inc. who exchanged their
stake in Dragon for stock in Lernout  Hauspie Speech Products
NV in 2000, according to the filing. LH went bankrupt on Nov.
29, 2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Settlements &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deutsche Bank to Pay $202.3 Million in Mortgage Fraud Accord &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) agreed to pay $202.3 million to settle
civil claims that its MortgageIT unit lied to qualify thousands
of risky mortgages for a federal insurance program in what the
U.S. called a &#8220;massive fraud.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. claimed in a lawsuit filed May 3, 2011, that
Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank and MortgageIT falsely certified
that they properly assessed the default risk of borrowers,
qualifying loans for insurance by the Housing and Urban
Development Department&#8217;s Federal Housing Administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank admitted to some of the conduct alleged in the
complaint, according to a statement yesterday by the office of
U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan. The U.S. sued under
the False Claims Act, which permitted it to seek triple damages
and penalties of more than $1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;MortgageIT and Deutsche Bank treated FHA insurance as
free government money to backstop lending practices that did not
follow the rules,&#8221; Bharara said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan approved the settlement
yesterday, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are very pleased to have reached this settlement, for
which we have already fully reserved, and to put this issue
behind us,&#8221; Renee Calabro, a Deutsche Bank spokeswoman, said in
an e-mailed statement. &#8220;This marks a significant step in
resolving our mortgage-related exposures.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Deutsche Bank AG, 11-cv-2976, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In the Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Santander Wins EU Court Challenge to French Tax on Funds &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banco Santander SA (SAN) and other financial services companies
including Societe Generale SA (GLE) won a court bid to overturn a
French levy on some mutual funds in a ruling that may lead to
rebates for investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union&#8217;s Court of Justice ruled that France was
wrong to charge a 25 percent withholding tax on dividend
payments to a type of EU-regulated funds, known as UCITS,
outside France. French-based products aren&#8217;t required to pay the
tax. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measure &#8220;constitutes a restriction on the free
movement of capital, which is in principle prohibited under EU
law,&#8221; the court said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;France has already received claims for tax refunds of more
than 4 billion euros ($5.2 billion) and could face more, said
Kit Dickson, a tax partner at Deloitte  Touche LLP, in a
telephone interview. EU countries have reacted to similar claims
by changing rules that tax foreign-based funds differently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ll see tax policy changes coming in from different
member states and they&#8217;ll either be starting to tax resident
funds as well as non-resident funds or they&#8217;ll choose to exempt
them,&#8221; Dickson said. &#8220;Spain changed some of its withholding
tax rules in 2010, the Netherlands changed them in 2008, France
chose to tax resident pension funds from 2009.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French Finance Ministry press office didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to calls and e-mails requesting comment on the decision
and the potential tax rebate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the ruling from the EU&#8217;s highest court is binding,
final decisions on the case must be taken by an administrative
court in Montreuil, France. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are: C-338/11 FIM Santander Top 25 Euro Fi,
Direction des residents a l&#8217;etranger et des services generaux,

&lt;p&gt;Traders Shifting to Risk Control Over Speed, Corvil&#8217;s Byrne Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traders dealing with the current electronic market are
willing to sacrifice some speed if it allows them to better
manage their risks, said Donal Byrne, chief executive officer of
technology company Corvil Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The environment we work in today is dramatically
different,&#8221; Byrne said yesterday at the Bloomberg Enterprise
Technology Summit hosted by Bloomberg Link in New York. &#8220;In
2008, 2009, it was speed at any cost. Now it&#8217;s speed fast enough
at the right cost,&#8221; with the ability to manage the risks
associated with the trading, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proliferation of high-speed, computer-driven trading
means the profitability of transactions can be influenced in
fractions of a second. Traders have invested in more powerful
servers and techniques such as co-location, in which exchanges
let them place computers close to the market, to improve
execution speed. The faster speeds come with greater risks,
Byrne said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A problem with these infrastructures is that they tend to
have a cliff-edge failure scenario,&#8221; said Byrne, whose
company&#8217;s products and services help clients measure latency, or
the time it takes to process data, and speed up stock trades.
&#8220;If we observe that there is a cliff, the risk is how close you
want to go to the cliff edge,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Latency is really
inversely proportional to risk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speed isn&#8217;t only about how quickly a trader can access
orders at a market, Stephen Ehrlich, CEO of New York-based
Lightspeed Financial LLC, said at the same event. It&#8217;s about how
quickly the trader&#8217;s systems can get the quotation and
transaction data and analyze the information, he added. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May 11 (Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase  Co.  Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon said the firm suffered a $2 billion trading
loss after an &#8220;egregious&#8221; failure in a unit managing risks,
jeopardizing Wall Street banks&#8217; efforts to loosen a federal ban
on bets with their own money. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is in
discussions with the U.K.&#8217;s financial regulator over the role
London employees had in a $2 billion trading loss, according to
two people familiar with the talks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Services Authority is speaking with officials
at the bank to determine the cause of the loss, said the people,
who declined to be identified because they weren&#8217;t authorized to
speak on the matter. The agency hasn&#8217;t opened a formal
investigation and there was no evidence of criminal activity,
according to the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said
yesterday that the New York-based firm suffered the loss after
an &#8220;egregious&#8221; failure in a unit involved in managing risks.
The firm&#8217;s chief investment office took flawed positions on
synthetic credit securities that remain volatile and may cost an
additional $1 billion this quarter or next, Dimon said. He
attributed it to &#8220;errors, sloppiness and bad judgment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $2 billion loss occurred in London under multiple
traders, according to an executive at the bank, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for the FSA and JPMorgan declined to immediately
comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonds of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
declined the most in six months after the firm said it suffered
a $2 billion trading loss at a unit set up to manage risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield premium investors demand to hold the lender&#8217;s $6
billion of undated 7.9 percent junior subordinated notes rather
than the 0.875 percent Treasury due 2018 rose 16 basis points to
392.2 basis points, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices at
10:10 a.m. in London. The price of the note, callable in 2018,
fell 2.2 cents on the dollar to 107.84 cents, pushing up the
yield to 6.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s chief investment office lost money on bets on
synthetic credit securities that remain volatile, Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon told analysts yesterday. Losses
mounted as JPMorgan tried to lay off hedges against credit
positions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s problem given the size of the positions it takes
is &#8220;moving in and out of markets in an orderly fashion, yet
without too much disruption of related pricing,&#8221; CreditSights
Inc. analysts led by David Hendler in New York said in a note.
The loss &#8220;puts into question the accuracy and calibration of
JPMorgan&#8217;s&#8221; risk models. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asian stocks slid for a third day,
with the regional index capping its worst week in almost six
months, as JPMorgan Chase  Co. revealed a $2 billion trading
loss and China&#8217;s industrial output grew at a slower pace, while
Indian factory production fell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrial  Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the world&#8217;s
biggest lender by market value, dropped 1.4 percent in Hong Kong.
Sony Corp. tumbled 6.4 percent in Tokyo, closing at its lowest
in more than three decades, after the maker of Bravia
televisions and PlayStation game consoles forecast half as much
profit as analysts expected. Yamada Denki Co. slumped 8 percent
after the electronics retailer said first-half profit will drop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market is struggling to digest negative factors
coming in one after another,&#8221; said Koichi Kurose, chief
economist in Tokyo at Resona Bank Ltd., Japan&#8217;s fifth-largest
lender by market value. &#8220;China&#8217;s economy doesn&#8217;t look good,
judging from reports. There are strong expectations for quick
monetary easing, but they can&#8217;t loosen regulations on real
estate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP) declined 0.9 percent to 118.59
as of 5:50 p.m. in Tokyo, with more than three shares falling
for each that rose. The measure is heading for 4.4 percent drop
this week, the most since the period ended Nov. 25, as France&#8217;s
political changes and instability in Greece threaten to derail
austerity plans and worsen Europe&#8217;s debt crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia&#8217;s SP/ASX 200 Index slid 0.2 percent. South
Korea&#8217;s Kospi Index (KOSPI) dropped 1.4 percent. Hong Kong&#8217;s Hang Seng
Index decreased 1.3 percent, whie Japan&#8217;s Nikkei 225 Stock
Average fell 0.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;China, India &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) slipped 0.6 percent. The
nation&#8217;s industrial output growth slowed to 9.3 percent last
month from 11.9 percent in March, missing estimates, according
to data released today by the government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese lenders fell. ICBC, as the world&#8217;s biggest bank is
also known, dropped 1.4 percent to HK$4.89 in Hong Kong. China
Construction Bank Corp. (939) fell 1.4 percent to HK$5.59. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s Sensitive Index swung between gains and losses as
output at the nation&#8217;s factories unexpectedly contracted in
March amid weaker domestic demand and exports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures on the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index dropped 0.4
percent today as JPMorgan revealed a $2 billion trading loss on
credit securities. The index rose 0.3 percent yesterday as
weekly U.S. jobless claims fell to a month low, showing
continued recovery in the labor market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Clearly JPMorgan got it wrong,&#8221; said Shane Oliver,
Sydney-based head of investment strategy at AMP Capital
Investors Ltd., which has almost $100 billion under management.
&#8220;I suspect it&#8217;s probably a one-off, but it comes during a week
where we&#8217;ve seen risk off in a big way.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sony, Yamada Denki &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony sank 6.4 percent to 1,135 yen in Tokyo, the lowest
close since August 1980. The company said profit this fiscal
year may reach 30 billion yen ($376 million), about half of the
average estimate of 18 analysts compiled by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yamada Denki (9831) slumped 8 percent to 4,100 yen, the most on
the MSCI Asia Pacific Index, after saying it expects first-half
profit to drop 47 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 579 companies on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index that
reported quarterly earnings since April 10, 224 exceeded
analysts&#8217;s estimates, while 214 fell short of expectations,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exporters advanced after a report showed U.S. claims for
unemployment benefits declined last week to the lowest level in
a month, easing concern that the American labor market is
faltering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nissan Motor Co. (7201), a carmaker that gets about one-third of
sales from North America, climbed 3.3 percent to 804 yen in
Tokyo. Honda Motor Co. gained 1.5 percent to 2,752 yen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Toyota Tops GM &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toyota Motor Corp. advanced 2.1 percent to 3,235 yen.
Asia&#8217;s largest automaker passed General Motors Co. to sell the
most cars and trucks in the world in the first three months of
the year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 5.1 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with an 8 percent gain by the SP
500 and a 2.7 percent advance by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 12.2 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with a multiple of 12.9 for the
SP 500 and 10.4 times for the Stoxx 600. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s $2 billion
loss at its chief investment office ranks among the biggest
trading debacles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s chief investment office, run by Ina Drew, 55,
took flawed positions on synthetic credit securities that remain
volatile and may cost an additional $1 billion this quarter or
next, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon told analysts
yesterday. Losses mounted as New York-based JPMorgan tried to

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s trading
position that led to a $2 billion loss may call for increased
Federal Reserve scrutiny of risk management as the central bank
steps up its post-crisis supervision of lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed officials are gathering more information about the
trading position, which they have known about for several weeks,
according to a person familiar with the matter. They don&#8217;t view
it as their role to approve or reject individual trades, the
person said. Rather, their job is to ensure firms have enough
capital to withstand losses, said the person, who wasn&#8217;t
authorized to discuss the matter and asked not to be identified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon announced the
&#8220;egregious&#8221; trading loss on May 10, saying there were &#8220;many
errors, sloppiness and bad judgment.&#8221; Dimon said on a
conference call with analysts that while the firm kept its
regulators &#8220;up to date,&#8221; he &#8220;didn&#8217;t have great information&#8221;
to share with them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fact that Jamie Dimon could come out and make some of
those statements&#8221; raises &#8220;lots of questions about who was
watching the store,&#8221; said Robert Eisenbeis, chief monetary
economist at Sarasota, Florida-based Cumberland Advisors and a
former Atlanta Fed research director. The Fed should be &#8220;going
in and looking at the internal controls and monitoring
procedures that the institution is taking, and stress those.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon announced the trading loss two months after the
biggest U.S. bank by assets passed a Fed stress test that put
its loans and securities through a scenario of deep recession
and a simulated global financial market shock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Small Loss&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a relatively small loss in a bank of that size,&#8221;
said William Isaac, a chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. in the 1980s and now a senior managing director at FTI
Consulting Inc. &#8220;The thing that&#8217;s rattling people is JPMorgan
Chase is widely considered one of the strongest and best banks
in the world.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares fell 9.3 percent, the most in nine months,
to $36.96 at the close of trading yesterday in New York. The KBW
Bank Index (BKX) of 24 financial stocks was down 1.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krishna Guha, a spokesman for Federal Reserve Bank of New
York, JPMorgan&#8217;s regulator, declined to comment. JPMorgan
spokesman Joseph Evangelisti also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the main U.S.
derivatives regulator, has been reviewing JPMorgan&#8217;s derivatives
trading activities since last month, according to a person who
was briefed on the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity
because the review is private. The CFTC hasn&#8217;t opened an
enforcement action against the bank, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SEC Probe &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission opened a
preliminary investigation into JPMorgan&#8217;s disclosures related to
the trades, according to another person briefed on the probe who
spoke on condition of anonymity because the matter isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, in an interview with NBC&#8217;s &#8220;Meet the Press&#8221; to air
tomorrow, said he didn&#8217;t know whether the bank had broken any
law or accounting rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve had audit, legal, risk, compliance, some of our
best people looking at all of that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t know
if any of that is true yet.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fed Analysis &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed officials need to examine their own analysis of the
bank&#8217;s risk management procedures and its governance, said Dino Kos, a former executive vice president at the New York Fed. He
said Fed supervisors should ask questions about how information
on risk is collected and reported, and what is done with it once
it reaches the executive level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What information is the board of directors being given?
What is being sent to the CEO and the senior managers on the
risk committee?&#8221; said Kos, now a managing director at
Hamiltonian Associates, a New York economic research and
consulting firm. &#8220;There is a separate question about judgment&#8221;
if Dimon understood the risks the bank was taking, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel Tarullo, the Fed governor in charge of supervision,
has emphasized that boards need to serve as independent monitors
of risk. The stress-tests were focused on whether a bank&#8217;s staff
and boards can put together a plan to manage capital through
times of economic turmoil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Checks and Balances &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s exceedingly important for boards to be involved, not
in micromanaging, but providing checks and balances on a
company,&#8221; said Timothy Smith, a senior vice president at
Boston-based Walden Asset Management, which manages $2.2
billion. &#8220;It&#8217;s a fair question to ask if Jamie Dimon says this
was just sloppy, where was the board as the $2 billion was being
lost?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tarullo has piloted one of the biggest overhauls of
financial supervision in the central bank&#8217;s history. In addition
to annual stress tests, the Fed routinely looks at risks across
all large banks in a new group formed from economists,
examiners, and computer modelers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed has also boosted its surveillance of financial
markets and bank lending to spot asset bubbles that may lead to
financial turmoil. Chairman Ben S. Bernanke established a new
Office of Financial Stability Policy and Research, which was
instrumental in shaping tougher guidelines earlier this year on
high-yield, high-risk bank loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fed Letters &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of April, the Fed sent letters critiquing banks
on their stress-test performance. Among the red flags Fed
officials spotted: the amount of capital that risk managers said
one bank might lose in stress test scenarios was at odds with
the payouts that the board wanted to make in the form of
dividends or share buybacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Wallison, a former member of the Financial Crisis
Inquiry Commission, said boards are &#8220;neither equipped to
understand the scope of a bank&#8217;s risks or engaged full-time in
the bank&#8217;s business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, &#8220;What boards can do is appoint a risk committee,
to which the bank&#8217;s risk manager will report, independently of
the CEO. The risk committee can then keep the board apprised of
the risks communicated by the risk manager. However, this
requires very deft management,&#8221; said Wallison, a fellow in
financial policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute in
Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ratings Reduction &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fitch Ratings, which yesterday lowered JPMorgan&#8217;s credit
grade by one level to A+ from AA-, said the $2 billion loss
&#8220;raises questions regarding JPM&#8217;s risk appetite, risk
management framework, practices and oversight.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s losses weren&#8217;t large enough to pose a risk to
the bank or the broader financial system, said Robert Engle,  a
winner of the 2003 Nobel Prize in economics and a professor at
New York University&#8217;s Stern School of Business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s tier 1 common capital ratio, a measure of
capital strength tracked by the Fed, never dipped below 5
percent in the 2012 stress scenario despite a hypothetical $28
billion in trading and counterparty losses and $56 billion in
loan losses, according to results of the stress tests released
on March 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think this particular number is big enough to get
in the way of the capital buffers that JPMorgan has,&#8221; Engle
said of the $2 billion loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Systemic Institution &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think of JPMorgan as being one of the more systemic
institutions because it is so big,&#8221; said Engle, who helped
develop a model of systemic risk at the Stern school&#8217;s
Volatility Institute. &#8220;But because it is big, a loss like this
is not going to bring it to its knees.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Stability Oversight Council, a group of
regulators charged with preventing a financial crisis, wasn&#8217;t
convened to discuss the JPMorgan loss and has no plans to meet,
said a Treasury Department official who declined to be
identified. The council&#8217;s chairman is Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, and it includes Bernanke. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
director Rajat Gupta asked a federal judge to exclude statements
by Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam from his trial
this month in Manhattan federal court, according to a filing
yesterday in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary Naftalis, Gupta&#8217;s defense lawyer, sought to bar
conversations between Rajaratnam and Galleon trader Ian Horowitz
on September 24, 2008, during which Rajaratnam claimed to have
received a call in which an unidentified caller said &#8220;something
good might happen to Goldman,&#8221; Naftalis wrote. He also sought
to exclude a recording of Rajaratnam and Galleon employee David
Lau in which Rajaratnam recounts a tip received from an
unidentified person &#8220;on the board of Goldman Sachs&#8221; about the
company&#8217;s earnings and revenues, the defense lawyer stated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The government&#8217;s application is an act of desperation,
breathtaking in its procedural audacity, seeking to rescue a
weak case by asking the court to do something that is both
unprecedented and unwarranted,&#8221; Naftalis said in court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta is scheduled to go on trial May 21 for securities
fraud and conspiracy for allegedly leaking tips to Rajaratnam.
He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney
Preet Bharara, declined to comment on yesterday&#8217;s filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Six Counts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta is charged with six counts, including securities
fraud and conspiracy, and faces as much as 20 years in prison on
the most serious count. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta&#8217;s lawyers have previously asked the judge to exclude
from the trial more than 26 wiretapped telephone conversations
made by the Federal Bureau of Investigation of Rajaratnam
speaking to others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defense argued that a July 29, 2008, wiretapped
telephone conversation between Gupta and Rajaratnam -- in which
the two discuss Goldman Sachs acquiring a commercial bank --
should be excluded because the information conveyed wasn&#8217;t
confidential and that the wiretap &#8220;is more prejudicial than
probative.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta&#8217;s lawyers argue that the government is attempting to
&#8220;reprise&#8221; the evidence it presented against Rajaratnam, &#8220;to
shore up its weak circumstantial case against Mr. Gupta,
resorting to evidence about other companies and other alleged
conspiracies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, who the government alleges is Gupta&#8217;s co-conspirator in the scheme, is serving an 11-year federal prison
sentence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Gupta, 11-cr-00907, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Robert Iger sold $81.6 million in stock after
the record-setting box-office performance of &#8220;Marvel&#8217;s The
Avengers&#8221; powered the shares to new highs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale of 1.8 million shares took place on May 10 at an
average price of $45.36, according to a regulatory filing
yesterday. Disney closed at a record on May 9, after the company
outlined plans for an &#8220;Avengers&#8221; sequel on its second-quarter
earnings call, and set subsequent marks on May 10 and May 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger, who plans to step down as CEO in March 2015,
exercised options at a cost of $55 million, according to the
filing, suggesting profit of $26.6 million before taxes and
commissions. The sales were part of routine financial planning
to meet his family&#8217;s diversification goals, Burbank, California-based Disney said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even after today&#8217;s transactions, his holdings exceed what
Mr. Iger owned at year-end,&#8221; the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger retains 1.14 million shares with value that is 400
percent greater than the company&#8217;s ownership requirements,
Disney said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s largest entertainment company, rose 0.6
percent to $45.56 yesterday in New York. The shares have climbed
21 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger became chairman in March, with a contract that runs
through June 2016. The company announced in October that it
would name a new CEO to succeed him in March 2015. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a Wall Street trader named Scott
watched the mortgage market crater in late 2007, a switch buried
deep in his brain flipped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened next is anatomized, tick by clinical tick, in
John Coates&#8217;s unsettling book, &#8220;The Hour Between Dog and Wolf.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott&#8217;s heart rate sped up, to pump extra blood to his arms
and thighs, Coates writes. His pupils dilated, to absorb more
light. He began to sweat, his breathing accelerated and he got a
hit of adrenalin. Then, as his losses surged to $24 million, his
bowels liquefied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Scott is a fictional representation, his symptoms
are all too real, judging from the observations of Coates, who
spent 12 years trading derivatives for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS),
Merrill Lynch  Co. and Deutsche Bank AG. (DBK) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As losses mount on the trading floor, one observes anxious
traders marching briskly to the toilets, the men&#8217;s room starting
to exude the fear and stench of a slaughterhouse,&#8221; he writes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this book isn&#8217;t on Jamie Dimon&#8217;s reading list, it should
be following the $2 billion trading loss at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biological side of financial markets struck Coates
during the dot-com bubble in the 1990s, as he watched normally
prudent tech-stock traders become overconfident, reckless and
euphoric. At the time, he had become fascinated with
breakthroughs in neuroscience, notably research into how
hormones affect the brain, influencing how we think and behave. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon said he was &#8220;dead wrong&#8221; in initially
dismissing news reports scrutinizing trades that led to a $2
billion loss and that it gives ammunition to proponents of
tighter regulations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a very unfortunate and inopportune time to have
this kind of mistake,&#8221; Dimon said in an interview broadcast
today on NBC&#8217;s &#8220;Meet the Press.&#8221; After news broke on the
magnitude of the bank&#8217;s bets, &#8220;we got very defensive, and
people started justifying everything we did,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon announced the loss May 10, almost four weeks after
referring to articles about the trades as &#8220;a complete tempest
in a teapot.&#8221; Positions taken by the firm&#8217;s chief investment
office on synthetic credit securities remain volatile and may
cost an additional $1 billion this quarter or next, Dimon told
analysts last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was &#8220;sloppy&#8221; and &#8220;stupid,&#8221; Dimon told &#8220;Meet
the Press.&#8221; He said he didn&#8217;t know if his firm broke any laws
or U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules. &#8220;You always
make mistakes,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loss, which fueled a 9 percent loss in JPMorgan shares
on May 11, will embolden those who want greater oversight, said
Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations and co-author of the
so-called Volcker rule. The cost to JPMorgan, in addition to the
financial loss, now will include the lender&#8217;s inability to roll
back regulations, Levin said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects &#8220;Avatar&#8221; number in second paragraph.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Marvel&#8217;s The Avengers,&#8221; broke
another box-office record, taking in $103.2 million for Walt
Disney Co. (DIS) in its second weekend in U.S. and Canadian theaters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film surpassed the $75.6 million benchmark for a second
weekend in 2009 by &#8220;Avatar,&#8221; researcher Hollywood.com Box-
Office said today in an e-mailed statement. Last week &#8220;The
Avengers&#8221; smashed the opening-weekend record with $207.4
million in domestic receipts. The vampire comedy &#8220;Dark
Shadows,&#8221; starring Johnny Depp and directed by Tim Burton,
opened in second place with $28.8 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The records raise the prospect studios will top their
previous best yearly sales of $10.6 billion set in 2009, Paul Dergarabedian, president of Hollywood.com Box-Office, said in an
interview. Sales and attendance for 2012 are both up over 2011,
according to Hollywood.com. Opening May 25 is Sony Corp. (6758)&#8217;s &#8220;Men
in Black 3,&#8221; forecast by Boxoffice.com to generate $205 million
in domestic sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger told investors
on a conference call last week the company will turn &#8220;The
Avengers&#8221; into a franchise. The studio also will continue to
draw individually from the characters for more films, he said.
Disney is developing a third &#8220;Iron Man&#8221; movie and a sequel to
&#8220;Thor,&#8221; the hammer-wielding Norse demigod also featured in
&#8220;The Avengers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &#8220;The Avengers,&#8221; several Marvel heroes band together to
fight an army of aliens led by Loki, also a character from Norse
mythology. The movie stars Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, Chris
Hemsworth as Thor and Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Dark Shadows,&#8221; from Time Warner Inc. (TWX)&#8217;s Warner Bros., is
inspired by the daytime television show about a New England
family entangled with vampires, ghosts and werewolves. Burton&#8217;s
tongue-in-cheek interpretation also features Michelle Pfeiffer,
Helena Bonham Carter and Eva Green. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Dark Shadows&#8221; was the only film to open in wide release. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest U.S.
oil company, said it sold more than 80 percent of the gas from
its Wheatstone project in Western Australia after reaching an
agreement with Tohoku Electric Power Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Japanese electricity supplier will buy as much as 1
million tons of liquefied natural gas per year under a 20-year
agreement, Roy Krzywosinski, managing director of Chevron&#8217;s
Australian unit, said yesterday in Adelaide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wheatstone is off to a &#8220;flying start,&#8221; Krzywosinski said.
&#8220;The Asian LNG market is certainly growing and we continue to
see demand.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron decided in September to go ahead with the A$29
billion ($29 billion) Wheatstone project, with the first
shipment of the fuel scheduled to begin in 2016. The venture,
along with the company&#8217;s A$43 billion Gorgon project, are among
seven LNG developments under way in the country to meet rising
Asian demand for the fuel. San Ramon, California-based Chevron
has said that Gorgon and Wheatstone are at the center of its
global expansion plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirteen out of 14 wells drilled in Australia since 2009
have been successful, adding resources to underpin potential LNG
plant expansions, Chevron said in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron said in April it signed an accord with Chubu
Electric Power Co. to buy gas from Wheatstone. Shipments are
scheduled to begin in 2016, with the project initially producing
8.9 million tons of LNG a year from two processing units. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s lawsuit claiming
attorneys for Ecuadorean plaintiffs in a pollution case
conspired to fabricate evidence was narrowed by a federal judge
in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan today allowed racketeering
claims in the suit to continue while dismissing three of the
claims that included fraud and tortious interference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate ruling, Kaplan also denied Chevron&#8217;s bid to
attach $780 million it claims in damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron was ordered last year to pay as much as $18 billion
in compensatory and punitive damages for Texaco Inc.&#8217;s alleged
dumping of toxic drilling wastes in the Ecuadorean jungle from
1964 to about 1992. The ruling came in an 18-year-old lawsuit
decided by a judge in Lago Agrio, a provincial capital near the
Colombian border. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron has denied wrongdoing in the Lago Agrio lawsuit.
The company says Texaco cleaned up its share of the pollution at
its former oil fields, which were taken over by PetroEcuador,
Ecuador&#8217;s state oil company. Chevron says it was released from
any future liability by an agreement between Texaco and Ecuador.
Chevron acquired Texaco in 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Today&#8217;s order affirms the core premise of Chevron&#8217;s RICO
and fraud case,&#8221; said Justin Higgs, a spokesman for Chevron.
&#8220;We are eager to progress our racketeering case and remain
resolute in our efforts to hold the perpetrators of this
unprecedented fraud and misconduct accountable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Judge Kaplan&#8217;s decisions to deny Chevron attachment and
to throw out several fraud claims represent yet another setback
for the oil company and its shareholders,&#8221; said Karen Hinton, a
spokeswoman for the plaintiffs. &#8220;Chevron&#8217;s RICO charges always
have been baseless and are nothing more than a public relations
stunt to hide the company&#8217;s environmental abuses and fraud in
Ecuador that destroyed the rainforest and killed numerous people
with cancer and other oil-related diseases.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Chevron Corp. v. Donziger, 11-691, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Office of Comptroller of the
Currency said yesterday that it is examining JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM)&#8217;s activities and evaluating their transactions following a
$2 billion loss that shook up bank leadership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The OCC is examining the bank&#8217;s activities and is in
continuous dialogue with bank personnel and other regulatory
colleagues as we evaluate details related to the specific
transactions as well as the surrounding risk management
processes that resulted in this unexpected loss,&#8221; Bryan Hubbard, an OCC spokesman, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator, which oversees national banks including
JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., also is evaluating risk management
strategies and practices at other large banks to validate their
understanding of risk levels and controls. The OCC said
JPMorgan&#8217;s losses affect its earnings while not presenting a
threat to the safety and soundness of the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;vast majority&#8221; of the bank&#8217;s chief investment office
that suffered the loss was part of the national bank, Hubbard
said. JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A.&#8217;s deposits are insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank used a new model for calculating its trading risk
in the first quarter that Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon,
56, said was inadequate. Former FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair said
yesterday that the change to the so-called value-at-risk
calculation &#8220;is something I can only assume the regulators were
aware of and briefed on.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve spokeswoman Barbara Hagenbaugh said the
central bank, which supervises JPMorgan&#8217;s holding company, is
studying organizational issues around the trading loss to assure
that they aren&#8217;t repeated in other areas of the bank. The loss
underscores the importance of capital buffers, Hagenbaugh said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Probes &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, which regulates derivatives trading,
are also examining JPMorgan&#8217;s trading activities, according to
people familiar with the probes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hubbard said it is &#8220;premature to conclude&#8221; the trades
would either have been permitted or banned by a forthcoming
regulation restricting banks&#8217; proprietary trading. The
regulation, known as the Volcker rule, is still being revised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The transactions at issue are complex and whether they
would qualify for exceptions under the statute or proposed rule
requires careful analysis,&#8221; Hubbard said. &#8220;The OCC and other
regulators are gathering additional details regarding the
transactions to determine the full regulatory implications of
these activities and the proposed rules currently being
considered.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s $2 billion
trading loss has unleashed a whirlwind of commentary on how (and
how not) to regulate the financial system. A few observations on
some of the central questions that have been raised: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this mean the Dodd-Frank financial reform law hasn&#8217;t
worked? Not at all. It doesn&#8217;t really tell us much of anything
about the effectiveness of the law overall or of the Volcker
rule in particular. The anti-Volcker set argues that, because
the bank was hedging, and hedging is allowed under an exception
to the Volcker rule&#8217;s proprietary trading ban, then the rule is
unworkable and should be repealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry, but this can&#8217;t be true. The rule hasn&#8217;t been put
into force yet, and won&#8217;t be until 2014. Regulators, moreover,
haven&#8217;t decided to what extent banks will be able to call their
trading activities &#8220;hedging.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is doubly true for so-called portfolio hedging --
buying and selling instruments to protect a bank&#8217;s aggregated
level of risk, instead of matching an individual exposure with a
countervailing one. Only the latter are considered true hedges,
and regulators haven&#8217;t decided whether and how much portfolio
hedging they will allow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aren&#8217;t new derivatives rules ineffective? These, too, are
part of the Dodd-Frank law and haven&#8217;t been put into force. But
it&#8217;s not as if JPMorgan&#8217;s derivatives trades were inaccessible
to Federal Reserve supervisors. Bank regulators had every right
to look at the books of the London branch of the chief
investment office, where the trades -- in a credit-derivative
index known as the CDX, which tracks the default risk of a
basket of companies -- were conducted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ill-Advised &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shouldn&#8217;t the traders and their bosses be thrown in jail?
Of all the commentary these last few days, this seems the
strangest. Nor does it seem relevant to remark, as some pundits
have, on the fact that no top financial executives have been
thrown into jail for their roles in the 2008 financial meltdown.
What Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon or his former chief
investment officer, Ina Drew, did may have been ill-advised, but
it was hardly criminal. More important, the 2008 crisis occurred
not because of a criminal conspiracy among top bankers but
because of errors of policy and regulatory oversight and
institutional greed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aren&#8217;t banks taking too many risks? Wait -- isn&#8217;t that what
banks do? Every time a bank lends money, it&#8217;s taking on risk.
And sometimes the same people complaining that banks are too
risky are simultaneously lamenting that banks aren&#8217;t lending
enough. They can&#8217;t have it both ways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#8217;s what JPMorgan&#8217;s trading losses do tell us: Extending
credit is a risky business, and banks must have the ability to
hedge those risks. But because bank deposits are guaranteed by
taxpayers, regulators must make sure banks are hedging properly
-- and not letting hedges become new risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators haven&#8217;t finalized plans, also authorized by the
Dodd-Frank law, for winding down very large banks on the verge
of failure. But even after regulators have off-the-shelf
instructions on how to liquidate the big banks in an orderly
way, the market will probably continue to view too-big-to-fail
banks, including JPMorgan, as operating with an implicit federal
guarantee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To account for both implicit and explicit federal
guarantees, the Volcker rule must be explicit: It shouldn&#8217;t
allow the kind of portfolio hedging that caused JPMorgan to lose
$2 billion. It shouldn&#8217;t let banks disguise proprietary trading
as hedging. And it shouldn&#8217;t let banks continue prop trading
under the guise of market making, in which they trade on behalf
of customers. For their part, regulators, who may have been
(once again) blind to the risks taken on by a major bank, must
be more vigilant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tougher Rules &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon was the rare Wall Street leader with credibility,
having brought JPMorgan through the 2008 crisis with only minor
scratches. In the end, though, the bank may have proven that
it&#8217;s too big to manage, all of which means that regulators may
need to consider something far tougher than last year&#8217;s Volcker
rule proposal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One solution would be to require financial institutions to
separate commercial banking using depositors&#8217; money from other
activities, similar to the ring-fencing the U.K. government is
demanding of its banks. Banks say they want the certainty of
clear rules, yet they don&#8217;t want regulators second-guessing
their trading desks or reinstating the Glass-Steagall law that
broke off investment from commercial banking. Ring-fencing would
accomplish it all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Matt Zames,
newly appointed to lead the bank&#8217;s chief investment office after
the unit suffered a $2 billion loss, shook up leadership and
announced a &#8220;renewed focus&#8221; on hedging risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zames named new finance and risk chiefs and wrote in a
staff memo that top London-based trading executive Achilles Macris would hand off duties. JPMorgan named Zames head of the
office earlier today to succeed Ina Drew, whose retirement after
the surprise loss marked the downfall of one of the highest-ranking women on Wall Street. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will have a sharp, renewed focus on our hedging
strategies, risk management and execution,&#8221; Zames, 41, wrote in
the memo. &#8220;JPMorgan Chase will come out of this experience as a
stronger firm.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56, announced the loss
May 10, assailing his firm&#8217;s handling of trading in synthetic
credit positions as &#8220;flawed, complex, poorly reviewed, poorly
executed and poorly monitored.&#8221; New York-based JPMorgan is
examining whether anyone in the unit, which employs a few dozen
people in London, sought to hide risks, though there isn&#8217;t yet
evidence that&#8217;s the case, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New London Chief &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s good to see there&#8217;s accountability as well as
responsibility here,&#8221; said David Hendler, an analyst at
CreditSights Inc., a New York-based research firm. &#8220;This person
was in charge of this strategy and it appears was not aware, or
giving the right signals to top management, of the risks that
were building.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senate Banking Committee members will
have chances to question regulators about events leading to
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s $2 billion trading loss at hearings on
Dodd-Frank Act rulemaking, the panel&#8217;s chairman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Over the next few weeks, the Senate Banking Committee
will continue its oversight of the implementation of Wall Street
reform by holding additional hearings with key financial
regulators,&#8221; Senator Tim Johnson, a South Dakota Democrat, said
today in an e-mailed statement. The JPMorgan losses are
&#8220;expected to be discussed at these hearings,&#8221; Johnson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel doesn&#8217;t have a hearing scheduled specifically
about the bank&#8217;s losses or its chief investment office, which
JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said made
&#8220;egregious mistakes&#8221; in overseeing the trades. There are no
plans at this point to invite executives of the New York-based
bank to testify, said Sean Oblack, Johnson&#8217;s spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We need to hear from regulators, and also review relevant
facts as they become available, before making a decision,&#8221;
Oblack said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson announced that JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank,
would be discussed at Senate hearings as lawmakers and
regulators sift through reports stemming from Dimon&#8217;s May 10
disclosure of losses tied to flawed positions on &#8220;synthetic
credit&#8221; trades. Johnson&#8217;s statement was a response to a request
from Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican, to hold
hearings on the bank&#8217;s losses &#8220;as expeditiously as possible.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dodd-Frank Hearings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Banking Committee will hear from representatives of the
Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
and other agencies at hearings on implementation of Dodd-Frank,
the regulatory law enacted in response to the 2008 credit
crisis, and the stability of financial markets, Johnson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congressional Democrats have seized on JPMorgan&#8217;s loss as
an example of why new bank regulations, including the so-called
Volcker rule, are needed. Regulators are in the final stages of
rulemaking on the proprietary trading ban named for former Fed
Chairman Paul Volcker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only reason the Senate Banking Committee wouldn&#8217;t hold
a hearing on the JPMorgan trade is &#8220;that maybe it points to
some flaw in the Volcker rule itself or flaw in Dodd-Frank,&#8221;
Corker, a member of the panel, said today in a Bloomberg
Television interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think any responsible chairman of any banking committee
right now would want members of that committee to understand how
something like this happens,&#8221; Corker said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BackOffice Associates LLC, a provider
of data management software and services, is talking to bankers
about an initial public offering, Chief Executive Officer David
Booth said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., (GS) an investor in the South Harwich,
Massachusetts-based company, is among banks discussing an IPO,
Booth said in an interview. BackOffice hasn&#8217;t determined the
size or price, though Booth said the company might sell more
than a 10 to 15 percent stake. Proceeds would fund acquisitions
and expansion outside the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the next 12-15 months, we&#8217;ll be ready to file an S-1,&#8221; Booth said, referring to the U.S. regulatory filing
required before an IPO. &#8220;That&#8217;s the direction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BackOffice is meeting with bankers following the successful
debut of Web-data analysis provider Splunk Inc. (SPLK), which has
surged 82 percent since its IPO in April. John Kinzer, who
helped take education-software maker Blackboard Inc. public in
2004, joined BackOffice as chief financial officer last week,
when the company also added former SAP AG executive Rex Ahlstrom
as chief strategy officer and hired Mark Logan to lead sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded in 1996, BackOffice has about 350 clients --
including many Fortune 500 companies -- which use its software
and services to streamline databases for sales and customer
contacts. It helps businesses switch from custom database
systems to alternatives made by SAP or Oracle Corp. (ORCL) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global market for master data management software will
grow 21 percent to $1.9 billion this year, estimates researcher
Gartner Inc. Other companies competing for this market include
Informatica Corp. (INFA), Talend, Utopia Inc. and International
Business Machines Corp. (IBM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Revenue Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BackOffice is &#8220;highly&#8221; profitable, and has annual sales
of $100 million to $200 million, Booth said. Revenue growth is
in double-digits, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At about three times sales -- a valuation typical for this
market -- the company may be worth $300 million to $600 million,
said Tom Taulli, who runs IPOPlaybook.com in Newport Beach,
California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Data is a hot business right now,&#8221; Taulli said in an
interview. &#8220;The company is addressing a pain point for
customers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is expanding operations in Canada, Brazil, U.K.
and Germany, and later plans to expand in Japan, China and
Australia, Booth said. Typically, BackOffice has bought one
company a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My expectation would be we&#8217;d ratchet that up,&#8221; Booth
said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be looking at acquiring some of the smaller
players out there. In the next several years, we believe we can
grow to a $500 million company and eventually to $1 billion.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Duvally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s top spokesman,
Joseph Evangelisti, sold his four-story townhouse in Manhattan&#8217;s
West Village for $6.7 million, more than three years after first
putting it on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale of the 3,765-square-foot (350-square-meter) home
at Grove and Bedford streets was completed on April 12,
according to New York City property records filed May 3. The
buyer was listed as East Hamptons Village LLC. Evangelisti
bought the property in 2005 for $4.7 million, city records show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evangelisti listed the five-bedroom home for $7.9 million
in November 2008, when the global economy slid into recession
and the Manhattan sales market stalled after the bankruptcy of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., according to property website
StreetEasy.com. He withdrew the listing in March 2009, then
offered the home that November for $7.5 million. The asking
price was whittled to $7 million in January, StreetEasy shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Fantastic views from the roof where you can see the
Empire State Building,&#8221; according to the listing by Robin
Bowden, a broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman Real Estate.
&#8220;There is a separate garden apartment that can be used for
income, or great for a nanny.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evangelisti declined to comment on the sale. Bowden didn&#8217;t
return a telephone message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Luxury Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The median price of Manhattan luxury apartments, defined as
the top 10 percent of all sales, climbed 4.4 percent in the
first quarter to to $4.13 million, according to appraiser Miller
Samuel Inc. and Prudential Douglas Elliman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evangelisti has worked for JPMorgan for more than 20 years.
As head of the company&#8217;s global media relations division, he is
also Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon&#8217;s spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan suffered a $2 billion trading loss after an
&#8220;egregious&#8221; failure in a unit managing risks, Dimon said on
May 10. The firm&#8217;s chief investment office took flawed positions
on synthetic credit securities that remain volatile and may cost
an additional $1 billion this quarter or next, Dimon told
analysts last week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Signs are emerging that traders are
already attempting to squeeze JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) after the
biggest U.S. bank said it faced $2 billion in trading losses
related to credit derivatives in the past six weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10-year Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index
Series 9, an older, less-active benchmark for credit-default
swaps created in 2007 in which JPMorgan trader Bruno Iksil in
London was said to have amassed as much as a $100 billion
position, jumped the most in almost eight months on May 11.
Another index contract that takes more concentrated risks on the
same companies recorded the biggest two-week surge in two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge-fund managers and other investors are circling as
speculation mounts over how and whether New York-based JPMorgan
will unwind the trades. JPMorgan said May 10 in a regulatory
filing that it may hold certain of its synthetic credit
positions for the &#8220;longer term,&#8221; a scenario that may backfire
on traders who have taken the opposite positions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re all trying to figure out what trade he had on,&#8221;
Peter Tchir, founder of New York-based hedge fund TF Market
Advisors, said in reference to Iksil. &#8220;It&#8217;s been nonstop.
Everyone&#8217;s trying to get their hands around it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading volumes rose at the end of last week on contracts
that Iksil, known as the London Whale for the size of his
positions, is believed to have taken, according to market
participants who asked not to be identified because their
trading strategies aren&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Narrowing Gap &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit swaps on Series 9 of the Markit CDX index that
expire in December 2017 jumped 12.3 basis points to 139.3 basis
points on May 11, the biggest increase since Sept. 22, before
reaching 145.9 today, according to data provider CMA. The
difference between the index and the weighted average of its
members, a gap that was said to have swelled from Iksil&#8217;s
trades, shrank to 1.5 basis points today from 14 on May 10 and
18 on May 1, according to prices from two market participants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A so-called tranche of the same index that covers the first
3 percent of losses, concentrating its risks in companies from
distressed bond insurer MBIA Inc. to mortgage insurer Radian
Group Inc., jumped to the highest since Jan. 5, climbing 2.6
percentage points to 71.9 percent upfront, CMA prices show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tranche, in which market participants familiar with
trading flows said Iksil also took positions, has climbed 8.9
percentage points this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Egregious Mistakes&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is seeking to stem losses after its chief
investment office took flawed positions on &#8220;synthetic credit&#8221;
trades, which may cost the lender an additional $1 billion this
quarter or next, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said May 10
on a conference call with analysts. The loss originated from the
firm&#8217;s London CIO unit, an executive at the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There were many errors, sloppiness and bad judgment,&#8221;
Dimon said. &#8220;These were egregious mistakes, they were self-inflicted.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said today Matt Zames will succeed Ina Drew as
chief investment officer. The entire staff of the London CIO
unit is at risk of dismissal as the trading loss prompts the
first executive departures as soon as this week, a person
familiar with the situation said. The firm is examining whether
anyone in the unit, which employs a few dozen people in London,
sought to hide risks, said the person, who requested anonymity
because the deliberations are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Poorly Executed&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The losses stem from trades that were designed to hedge the
bank&#8217;s overall credit risks, Dimon said on the conference call.
The bank was reducing the hedge, he said, &#8220;but in hindsight,
the new strategy was flawed, complex, poorly reviewed, poorly
executed, and poorly monitored.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The portfolio has proven to be riskier, more volatile,
and less effective as an economic hedge than we thought,&#8221; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, 56, has been a critic of regulations including the
so-called Volcker rule meant to bar proprietary trading by banks
with federally insured deposits. He told analysts that the
timing of the announcement &#8220;plays right into all the hands&#8221; of
those pushing for a strict version of the restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The chips at the poker table are in fewer and fewer hands
because there are fewer firms with size balance sheets,&#8221; said
Lawrence McDonald, senior director for credit, sales and trading
at Newedge USA LLC and author of the book &#8220;A Colossal Failure
of Common Sense&#8221; about the 2008 demise of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. &#8220;This is the product of the government&#8217;s
regulation. It&#8217;s crazy. It puts some firms at greater risk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Multiple Traders &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News first reported April 5 that Iksil had
amassed positions that were so large he was driving price moves
in the $10 trillion market for credit swaps indexes tied to
corporate creditworthiness. The loss occurred in London under
multiple traders, according to an executive at the bank, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of hedge funds and other money managers began
looking to profit by betting distortions created by JPMorgan&#8217;s
moves would normalize. The dislocations were so large that they
were creating situations in which traders were able to
effectively buy $1 of default protection for about 80 cents, the
market participants said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Series 9 of the Markit CDX index is tied to 121 companies,
all of which were investment grade more than four years ago,
including Armonk, New York-based MBIA&#8217;S now junk-rated MBIA
Insurance Corp. unit and Philadelphia-based Radian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Index Rolls &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New versions of Markit Group Ltd.&#8217;s indexes are created
every six months. Companies are replaced if they no longer have
appropriate credit grades, aren&#8217;t among the most actively traded
borrowers, or fail to meet other criteria. Four other companies
initially included in Series 9, CIT Group Inc., Washington
Mutual Inc., Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, triggered credit events
during or after the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Series 9 contract expiring in 2017 climbed 27 basis
points from the end of March through last week. JPMorgan&#8217;s
trades probably aren&#8217;t one-way bets, market participants said in
April. The bank may be offsetting the trades by buying
protection on the same index with contracts that expire about
seven months from now, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That strategy would pay JPMorgan the difference between the
long-dated contracts and the short-dated ones, about 41 basis
points at the end of March for Series 9, and the trade would
gain when the gap narrows or lose when it widens. The hedge
would end in December unless another trade is made to replace
it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gap on the index soared 14 basis points on May 11 and
has climbed 25 basis points since the end of March, a 61 percent
increase, according to data from CMA, which is owned by CME
Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Blood In The Water&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between the same maturities of the riskiest
tranche contracts ballooned to 54.2 percentage points from 45.5
percentage points at the end of March, CMA prices show. It
widened 3 percentage points on May 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I know how Wall Street works. When there&#8217;s blood in the
water, the sharks are going to attack that animal,&#8221; Charles Peabody, an analyst with Portales Partners LLC in New York who
downgraded his recommendation on JPMorgan&#8217;s stock in March to
&#8220;sector perform,&#8221; said in a telephone interview last week.
&#8220;It could make it very difficult for them to unwind a trade.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in credit markets, the current version of the
Markit CDX Investment Grade Index, Series 18, climbed by 5.3
basis points to a mid-price of 113.9 basis points as of 12:07
p.m. in New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s the highest level since Jan. 18 on an intra-day
basis for the index, which typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves. Credit-default
swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rate Swap Spreads &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. two-year interest-rate swap spread, a measure of
bond market stress, also reached the highest level since
January, climbing 3.1 basis points to 37.78 basis points as of
11:51 a.m. in New York. The gauge, at the highest level since
Jan. 12 on an intra-day basis, widens when investors seek the
perceived safety of government securities and narrows when they
favor assets such as corporate bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds of Chesapeake Energy Corp. are the most actively
traded dollar-denominated corporate securities by dealers today,
with 218 trades of $1 million or more as of 11:52 a.m. in New
York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mitt Romney says he wants to talk
about the economy in this presidential campaign, including his
call to repeal the Dodd-Frank financial regulation law. JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s $2 billion trading loss in risky transactions
isn&#8217;t the sort of conversation he had in mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, presumptive Republican nominee Romney has said
little about the transaction that is roiling Wall Street and
Washington, prompting an inquiry by the Federal Reserve, a call
for a congressional investigation and a demand by Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic Senate candidate in Massachusetts, that
JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon resign from the
board of the New York Federal Reserve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Any time you have a development that suggests businesses
take unnecessary and unwise risks, you give ammunition to
Democrats and cause problems for the Republican narrative,&#8221;
said Stu Rothenberg, editor of the nonpartisan Rothenberg
Political Report. &#8220;Romney will have to deal with it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romney, co-founder of private-equity firm Bain Capital LLC,
has spotlighted his vow to repeal the Dodd-Frank law that aims
to strengthen financial regulations, calling it one of several
overly burdensome laws backed by President Barack Obama that
costs jobs. Romney hasn&#8217;t directly commented on the JP Morgan
losses since Dimon disclosed them on May 10; he ignored a
reporter&#8217;s shouted question about the matter at a May 11 rally
in Charlotte, North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Common-Sense Regulation&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campaign spokeswoman Andrea Saul had said in a statement
the losses showed &#8220;the importance of oversight and transparency
in the derivatives market,&#8221; and that Romney as president would
&#8220;push for common-sense regulation that gives regulators tools
to do their jobs, and that gives investors more clarity.&#8221; she
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked for specifics, the campaign later replied with
remarks he made last year while campaigning in New Hampshire,
when he said he would favor regulating derivatives and imposing
different capital requirements on different forms of securities.
The campaign also pointed to Romney&#8217;s 59-point economic plan, in
which he writes that &#8220;some of the concepts in Dodd-Frank have a
place.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Obama, the JPMorgan difficulties offer an opportunity
to contrast the positions of the two candidates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is amazing that there are still those who are out
there arguing we should repeal Wall Street reform, that we
should let Wall Street write their own rules again,&#8221; White
House Press Secretary Jay Carney said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making Connections &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama is in New York today for events including a
fundraiser with Wall Street executives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama has sought greater regulation. He signed the Dodd-Frank law and asking for more funding for the Commodities
Futures Trading Commission to implement the new rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would think the president would seek to connect the
JPMorgan story with his message of a need for regulators to
watch big business,&#8221; Rothenberg said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saul, the Romney spokeswoman, responded yesterday to the
Obama campaign with a statement saying the Republican &#8220;believes
in a system of sensible financial regulation,&#8221; while the
president &#8220;supported legislation that makes another crisis more
likely, thus putting taxpayers at risk for future bad decisions
made by Wall Street banks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romney&#8217;s economic plan, released in September, argues for
the repeal of the Dodd-Frank law while saying some aspects of it
should be retained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Necessary Elements&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Greater transparency for inter-bank relationships,
enhanced capital requirements, and provisions to address new
forms of complex financial transactions are all necessary
elements of effective financial reform,&#8221; the plan says. &#8220;But
these concepts must be translated into law in a way that creates
a simple, predictable, and efficient regulatory system
appropriate for our dynamic economy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the presidential race has heated up, Romney has focused
on his repeal proposal without elaborating on what parts of the
law he backs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romney as a candidate also toughened his position on the
Sarbanes-Oxley financial accounting overhaul enacted in the wake
of the Enron Corp. scandal. After initially saying he would
favor amending that law, he sharpened his stance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked by a voter March 3 in Beavercreek, Ohio, if he
planned to &#8220;basically repeal&#8221; the Sarbanes-Oxley measure,
along with the health-care overhaul Obama pushed through
Congress and the Dodd-Frank measure, Romney responded, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;By the way, when I get rid of Obamacare and I get rid of
Dodd-Frank and I get rid of Sarbanes-Oxley, it doesn&#8217;t mean I
don&#8217;t want to have any law or any regulation,&#8221; Romney said.
&#8220;It means I want to make sure it&#8217;s modern, it&#8217;s updated, it
goes after the bad guys, but it also encourages the good guys.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Repeal Difficulty &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repealing financial reforms will be difficult following
JPMorgan&#8217;s $2 billion loss, which Dimon said could cost an
additional $1 billion this quarter or next. Proponents of
oversight will be bolstered, said Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan
Democrat and chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations, on NBC News&#8217; &#8220;Meet the Press&#8221; yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The real problem is, the battle is not just between
Washington and Wall Street,&#8221; Levin said. &#8220;The battle is inside
of Washington.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, also on &#8220;Meet the Press,&#8221; said JPMorgan was
&#8220;sloppy&#8221; and &#8220;stupid.&#8221; He said he didn&#8217;t know if his firm
broke any laws or U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules.
&#8220;You always make mistakes,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Volcker Rule &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon has been a critic of Dodd-Frank provisions including
the so-called Volcker rule, which is meant to bar proprietary
trading by banks with federally insured deposits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he announced the losses, almost four weeks after
characterizing articles about the transactions as &#8220;a complete
tempest in a teapot,&#8221; Dimon said the trading &#8220;may not violate
the Volcker rule, but it violates the Dimon principle.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warren, who formerly worked in the Office of the President
and served as chairwoman of the Congressional Oversight Panel
for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, distributed an e-mail
over the weekend calling on Dimon to step down from his New York
Fed position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He advises the Federal Reserve on the oversight of the
financial industry,&#8221; Warren said in an e-mailed statement.
&#8220;Dimon should resign from his post at the New York Fed to send
a signal to the American people that Wall Street bankers get it,
and to show that they understand the need for responsibility and
accountability.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;White House press secretary Jay Carney said today it&#8217;s &#8220;amazing&#8221; there are &#8220;still those who
are out there arguing that we should repeal Wall Street reform&#8221;
after JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s $2 billion trading loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is strong evidence that having these rules of the
road in place are essential to making sure that taxpayers don&#8217;t
get left holding the bag,&#8221; Carney told reporters on Air Force
One as President Barack Obama traveled to New York City, where
he will deliver the commencement speech at Barnard College and
attend two fundraisers. &#8220;We have to remain ever vigilant.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56,
announced the loss May 10 and has criticized his company&#8217;s
handling of trading in synthetic credit securities as &#8220;flawed,
complex, poorly reviewed, poorly executed and poorly
monitored.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan today said Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew will
retire after the firm suffered the $2 billion trading
loss, marking the downfall of one of the highest-ranking women
on Wall Street. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt Zames, the 41-year-old head of global fixed income in
the investment bank, will succeed Drew, New York-based JPMorgan
said in a statement. The entire London staff of the bank&#8217;s chief
investment office, where the loss occurred, is at risk of
dismissal, a person familiar with the situation said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is amazing that there are still those who are out there
arguing we should repeal Wall Street reform, that we should let
Wall Street write their own rules again,&#8221; Carney said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., one of 21
primary dealers that trade with the Federal Reserve, said the
U.S. 10-year note yield may drop to a record low 1.5 percent as
deteriorating conditions in Europe boost demand for safe assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Treasuries have room to rally further if the situation in
Europe continues to deteriorate,&#8221; strategists led by Terry Belton, global head of fixed-income strategy for the firm in New
York, wrote in a client note dated May 11. Political turmoil in
Greece since voters revolted against austerity in May 6
elections raises &#8220;the risks of a Greek exit from the euro zone
following the new elections likely to take place June 17,&#8221; they
wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten-year Treasury note yields tumbled to 1.67 percent on
Sept. 23, a record, as investors sought refuge in U.S.
government debt amid concern the global economy was on the brink
of another recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields (USGG10YR) on the benchmark security dropped as much as seven
basis points today, or 0.07 percentage point, to 1.77 percent,
the lowest level since Oct. 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yields may trade at about 1.7 percent if comparable-maturity Spanish bonds&#8217; yields increase to 6.5 percent, the
strategists wrote. U.S. 10-year yields may slide 20 to 25 basis
points for each 100 basis-point jump in Spanish and Italian
debt, they wrote. Spain&#8217;s 10-year note yields climbed as much as
35 basis points today to 6.36 percent, the highest level since
November, and yields on Italian 10-year debt rose 22 basis
points to 5.73 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan forecasts Treasury 10-year yields will fall to
1.70 percent by June 30 and rise to 2.50 percent by year-end. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rand depreciated for a fifth day,
the longest losing streak since September, as commodities
retreated to their cheapest this year and stocks tumbled on
growing concern Greece will exit the single European currency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Africa&#8217;s currency fell as much as 1.4 percent to
8.2100 per dollar, the weakest level this year. It traded 1.2
percent down at 8.1934 per dollar by 4:05 p.m. in Johannesburg,
bringing its decline this month to 5.1 percent. The yield on the
nation&#8217;s 6.75 percent bonds due 2021 climbed seven basis points,
or 0.07 percentage point, to 7.79 percent, the highest on a
closing basis since April 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexis Tsipras, who heads Greece&#8217;s anti-bailout Syriza
party, won&#8217;t attend a meeting called by President Karolos
Papoulias today, the Athens-based party said in a statement.
Syriza rejected a unity government last week following
inconclusive elections on May 6. Greece may face another vote
unless leaders can agree on a new coalition. Emerging market
stocks fell to a four-month low and the Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI
Index (SPGSCI) declined for a ninth day. Commodities account for 45
percent of South Africa&#8217;s exports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The rand remains under considerable pressure as Greece
looks like it&#8217;s sliding towards a euro zone exit&#8221; John Cairns
and Josina Solomons, currency strategists at Rand Merchant Bank
in Johannesburg, said in e-mailed comments. &#8220;Risks are clearly
for further losses on both the euro and the rand.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rand often moves in tandem with the euro, with a
statistical correlation of 0.7 over the past year. A value of 1
would mean they moved in lock step. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;China &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rand extend its decline after China cut banks&#8217; reserve
requirements for the third time in six months after industrial
production, new loans and retail sales grew less than forecast
last month, signalling the slowdown in the world&#8217;s second-largest economy may be steeper than expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greek withdrawal from the euro area was &#8220;technically&#8221;
possible yet would damage the euro, European Central Bank
Governing Council member Patrick Honohan said in Tallinn on May
12. The euro area accounted for 22 percent of South Africa&#8217;s
exports last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With the Greek political crisis far from resolved, there
is likely to be more bad news for investors to trade on which
will guide short-term decision making and direction,&#8221; George Glynos, an economist at Johannesburg-based ETM Analytics, wrote
in e-mailed comments today. &#8220;That the rand may have under-performed in recent weeks does not reflect much other than the
local unit&#8217;s link to commodities that have also come under some
pressure.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Price Swings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rand&#8217;s three-month implied volatility against the
dollar rose 45 basis points to 16 percent today, the highest
since Feb. 23, indicating that options traders see wider price
swings in coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on South Africa&#8217;s $1 billion of 8.875 percent
bonds due 2022 dropped one basis point to 3.87 percent. The
extra yield investors demand to hold the debt rather than U.S.
Treasuries widened by 12 basis points to 213 basis points, the
most since April 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of insuring the nation&#8217;s foreign-currency debt
rose 11.1 basis points today to 171.1 basis points, the highest
since Feb. 17, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The move
was the biggest in a day since Jan. 4. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) named
Valentino D. Carlotti, the former president of its bank in
Brazil, to run a newly created client-focused group within the
sales and trading division, according to an internal memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlotti, 46, will be based in New York and report to
Enrico Gaglioti, who runs equity sales globally, and to Tom Cornacchia, the head of sales for fixed-income, currency and
commodities in the Americas, according to the memo. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman Sachs, confirmed
the memo&#8217;s contents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which generated 57 percent of its first-quarter revenue from sales and trading, is forming the so-called
Institutional Client Group to &#8220;provide a central point of
contact and relationship management for clients of the
securities division,&#8221; according to the memo. ICG will be
composed of salespeople with experience in multiple product
areas and will coordinate with the executive office to ensure
clients are getting appropriate service, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
reported last month that first-quarter profit fell 23 percent.
Revenue from trading bonds, currencies and commodities lagged
behind rivals JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Citigroup Inc. in the
quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sao Paulo Office &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlotti, who joined the firm in 1994 in investment
banking, was later a salesman in equities who covered hedge
funds and mutual funds, according to the memo. He has managed
the Sao Paulo office for the last five years. Carlotti has been
a managing director since 2001 and was promoted to partner in
2006, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 2011, Goldman Sachs named Alejandro Vollbrechthausen
to replace Carlotti as president of the Brazilian unit and said
Carlotti would remain in the region to oversee the transition
before relocating to New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The memo was signed by Isabelle Ealet, Pablo J. Salame and
Harvey M. Schwartz, the three co-heads of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
securities division, which oversees sales and trading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s $2 billion
loss on synthetic credit securities bolsters the case of banking
critics pushing for tighter regulations on proprietary trading,
SunTrust Banks Inc. Chief Executive Officer William Rogers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is a black eye for the industry,&#8221; Rogers said in an
interview with Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;In the Loop&#8221; from
Atlanta. &#8220;It would certainly embolden those on the Volcker side
of that equation,&#8221; referring to the so-called Volcker rule
setting restrictions on trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Carl Levin, Democrat from Michigan and co-author of
the rule, said May 11 the JPMorgan loss was a &#8220;stark reminder&#8221;
to regulators drafting a proprietary trading ban as part of the
Dodd-Frank act. JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan
Stanley have lobbied to expand exemptions included in the
initial proposal, complaining that the measure is so broad and
ill-defined that it will increase risks for clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chief executive of Atlanta-based SunTrust (STI) said he had
&#8220;reached out to our board&#8221; after JPMorgan&#8217;s disclosure to
explain the regional bank had &#8220;very modest exposure&#8221; to the
market for credit derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For SunTrust, Volcker is not the big issue for us,&#8221;
Rogers said. &#8220;Our trading activity is really client oriented
and client directed. So while that force would be more
emboldened, I am not really worried about the financial
immediate impact on SunTrust.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Small Number&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rogers said the any concern over the loss at JPMorgan
should be tempered by the institution&#8217;s size.  Noting the bank&#8217;s
market capitalization of $142 billion, &#8220;$2 billion relative to
JPM&#8217;s total cap is a small number,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who said the company made
&#8220;egregious mistakes,&#8221; deserves credit for how he has handled
the disclosure and crisis, Rogers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I am not sure Jamie Dimon is seeking my advice on how to
handle a crisis, but he met it head on and I think that is what
CEOs are supposed to do,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Your personal credibility
and your company&#8217;s credibility is on the line.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rogers also said SunTrust will resubmit a capital plan to
the Federal Reserve after an initial proposal was not accepted
by the central bank in March following its &#8220;stress test&#8221;
reviewing how the lender would fare in a several economic slump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new plan will incorporate results from &#8220;a really good
first quarter at our company&#8221; and will benefit from more
clarity in how the Fed has calculated losses from its recession
scenarios. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;More Transparency&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have a much better understanding of the modeling, more
transparency&#8221; from the Fed, he said. &#8220;That will help us build
a better internal system and a better ability to respond.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SunTrust&#8217;s Tier 1 common capital ratio would fall to 4.8
percent if the lender carried out capital plans submitted to the
Fed, below the central bank&#8217;s minimum requirement of 5 percent,
according to the test results. Capital plans can include
dividend payouts, stock repurchases and share sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of SunTrust have risen 34 percent this year through
May 11, nearly double the 18 percent gain for the KBW Bank
Index. SunTrust has operations in Florida, Georgia, Maryland,
North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West
Virginia and the District of Columbia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s ESPN sports network
is talking with Apple Inc. (AAPL) about giving subscribers online
access to programming through the computer maker&#8217;s Apple TV
device, according to two executives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network would consider putting its WatchESPN
application on Apple TV for users who confirm they are pay-TV
customers, ESPN executive Sean Bratches said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESPN, the most-watched U.S. sports network is making more
programming available online and on mobile devices to reach
customers watching TV in new formats. The network now provides
subscribers ESPN3, a digital channel that&#8217;s part of the
WatchESPN app, to subscribers through Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s Xbox
video-game console as part of some pay-TV plans, including from
Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)&#8217;s FiOS and Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re a platform-agnostic content company,&#8221; Bratches,
the network&#8217;s executive vice president of affiliate and
advertising sales, said today in an interview. &#8220;To the extent
that in the future there&#8217;s an opportunity with Apple to
authenticate through the pay-TV food chain as we&#8217;re doing with
Microsoft, that&#8217;s something that we will participate in.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESPN is also talking with other Internet video providers,
said Ed Erhardt, ESPN&#8217;s president of global customer marketing
and sales. Earlier this year, ESPN allowed Facebook Inc. (FB) users
to watch college basketball games on an authenticated basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The executives spoke at advertiser meetings in New York
today, where the network announced programming for the TV season
starting in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Deal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No deal is imminent with Apple, said Amy Phillips, a
spokeswoman for Bristol, Connecticut-based ESPN. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re not having conversations with Apple about
authenticating WatchESPN,&#8221; Phillips said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom Neumayr, a spokesman for Apple, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using apps to expand cable-channel viewing online involves
a number of steps, including security, carrier access and
getting the software installed on Web-connected devices, such as
the Xbox, that are popular with viewers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time Warner Cable Inc., for example, offers customers
WatchESPN, though ESPN3 isn&#8217;t available through Xbox. The cable
system, second to Comcast, expects to have a deal soon,
according to Alex Dudley, a spokesman for New York-based Time
Warner Cable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, declined 0.4 percent
to $45.01 at the close in New York. The stock has climbed 20
percent this year. Apple, based in Cupertino, California, fell
0.9 percent to $553.17 and has gained 37 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenlight Capital Inc., the hedge-fund manager run by David Einhorn, exited its stake in Yahoo!
Inc. (YHOO) during the first quarter while opening new positions in
Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC) and Expedia Inc. (EXPE) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based fund also sold 7.68 million Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT) shares, cutting its stake to 7.49 million, according to a
filing today with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
stock has surged 25 percent since May 25, 2011, when Einhorn
called for Microsoft&#8217;s board to replace Chief Executive Officer
Steve Ballmer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlight sold 3.02 million Yahoo shares during the first
quarter, according to the filing. Chief Executive Officer Scott Thompson resigned this week after failing to correct errors in
his credentials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Einhorn&#8217;s firm purchased 2.4 million Computer Sciences
shares during the first quarter, 1 million Expedia shares and
almost 562,000 shares of grocery-store chain Roundy&#8217;s Inc. (RNDY) The
fund didn&#8217;t own shares of those companies at the end of the
fourth quarter, according to a filing in February. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc. has lured
suitors such as Pfizer Inc. (PFE), AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) and Sanofi, which
signed confidentiality agreements on the drugmaker&#8217;s sale
process, said people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck  Co. (MRK), Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. (4502), Roche Holding AG (ROG)
and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) also signed agreements to get
access to confidential financial and product information for
Amylin, said the people, who declined to be identified as talks
are private. The drug developer is seeking a buyer following its
rejection of an unsolicited offer from Bristol-Myers, people
with knowledge of the matter said earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-round bids are due in the next two weeks, said two of
the people. Amylin, the maker of the diabetes drugs Bydureon and
Byetta, has a market capitalization of more than $4 billion and
generated more than $650 million in revenue last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Diabetes is an area companies either want a position in
or want a stronger position in,&#8221; said Mark Clark, an analyst at
Deutsche Bank in London. &#8220;Amylin is not a massive financial
stretch so it comes down to what companies&#8217; alternatives are,
whether there are other synergies involved and who it makes the
most sense to. Some companies are more desperate for revenue
sources than others.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clark recommends buying Sanofi shares and has a &#8220;hold&#8221;
rating on AstraZeneca. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Assess Interest &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Diego-based Amylin hired Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) to assess takeover interest, one person
said last month. Representatives at Amylin, Takeda, Merck,
AstraZeneca, Sanofi, Bristol-Myers, Roche and Pfizer declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amylin gained 6.4 percent to $27.30 at 4 p.m. New York
time, the shares&#8217; highest value since August 2008. They have
gained 15 percent since March 28, when Bloomberg reported
Amylin&#8217;s rejection of the Bristol-Myers bid. Amylin spurned an
offer of $22 a share from New York-based Bristol-Myers in
February, people with knowledge of the bid said in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billionaire investor Carl Icahn dropped a lawsuit against
the company last month following a meeting with Chief Executive
Officer Daniel Bradbury. Icahn owned about 8.8 percent of Amylin
as of April, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. He had
sued Amylin in Delaware Chancery Court over a rule requiring
advance notice of candidates for board seats after the board
rejected Bristol-Myers&#8217;s $3.5 billion buyout bid. Icahn has said
he still wants Amylin to pursue a sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bydureon Estimate &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amylin received regulatory approval for Bydureon, a once-weekly formulation of its earlier diabetes drug Byetta, in
January, and the therapy may draw $1.5 billion in peak annual
sales in the U.S., according to Robyn Karnauskas, an analyst
with Deutsche Bank. The drugmaker had been seeking a partner to
help market Bydureon outside the U.S. since November, when it
ended a collaboration with Eli Lilly  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanofi, based in Paris, and Merck, in Whitehouse Station,
New Jersey, would gain the most strategically from purchasing
Amylin, Leerink Swann analysts Seamus Fernandez and Steve Yoo
wrote in a research note today. They estimate a price of more
than $30 a share &#8220;for the right acquirer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We would see Amylin bringing several key strategic
positives as well as substantial operational synergies for
Sanofi,&#8221; the analysts wrote, naming a prescribing change that
includes dosing of Byetta with Sanofi&#8217;s Lantus, immediate access
to the GLP-1 class of diabetes drugs and overlaps in research
and development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Diabetes Commitment &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck, the analysts wrote, &#8220;has a deep commitment to
diabetes&#8221; and is facing competition from Bristol-Myers,
AstraZeneca and Takeda. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanofi (SAN) started looking at Amylin last year, after the U.S.
company said it had ended the partnership with Eli Lilly, one
person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanofi internally has discussed the rationale of a bid,
given that Byetta would compete with its own experimental
version of a similar drug, known as lixisenatide, one person
said. The French company, which has been gathering information
on Amylin, also has some doubts as to the potential of Bydureon,
this person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Sanofi is keen on Amylin because Byetta is a
successful product that would give it access to a so-called GLP-1 treatment well before lixisenatide comes to market, another
person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Very Explicit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sanofi has been very explicit that they want a full range
of products and services for diabetes,&#8221; Clark said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roche, based in Basel, Switzerland, tried to expand in the
GLP-1 market once before, with no luck. It returned rights to
the experimental GLP-1 diabetes drug taspoglutide to developer
Ipsen SA (IPN) last year, after patients dropped out of trials because
of side effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bristol-Myers and London&#8217;s AstraZeneca failed to win U.S.
clearance earlier this year to sell the experimental diabetes
treatment dapagliflozin as regulators sought more safety data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Any of the companies listed would fit the characteristics
of having a &#8216;strong&#8217; RD commitment to diabetes,&#8221; the Leerink
Swann analysts wrote. &#8220;Amylin could be deemed highly strategic
for any of the companies cited.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank, will consider reclaiming incentive pay from employees
including former Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew after her
unit had a $2 billion trading loss, said two senior executives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lender can cancel stock awards or demand they be repaid
if an employee &#8220;engages in conduct that causes material
financial or reputational harm,&#8221; JPMorgan said in its annual
proxy statement. The company will claw back pay if it&#8217;s
appropriate, said one of the executives, who asked not to be
identified because no decisions have been made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incident, which led to Drew&#8217;s retirement yesterday, may
test JPMorgan&#8217;s clawback policy amid mounting investor criticism
over Wall Street pay practices and as regulators investigate the
trades. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said the strategy
that led to the loss was &#8220;poorly executed and poorly
monitored&#8221; and that it gave ammunition to proponents of
stricter bank regulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The political environment is very sensitive right now and
this couldn&#8217;t have come at a worse time,&#8221; said David Knutson, a
credit analyst in Chicago with Legal  General Investment
Management, which owns JPMorgan debt. &#8220;I can see how pressure
from regulators could result in JPMorgan attempting to exercise
a clawback.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department and the
Federal Bureau of Investigation in New York have begun a
criminal probe of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s $2 billion trading
loss, a person familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. is looking into whether criminal wrongdoing
occurred in relation to the losses the bank reported last week,
said the person, who declined to be identified because the
matter isn&#8217;t public. The inquiry is in its most preliminary
stage, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates
derivatives trading, also are examining New York-based
JPMorgan&#8217;s trading activities, according to people familiar with
those probes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said on May 10
that the bank made &#8220;egregious&#8221; mistakes and that the losses of
about $2 billion tied to synthetic credit securities were
&#8220;self-inflicted.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chief Investment Office &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trading occurred in a portfolio of credit investments
at a unit of the bank called the Chief Investment Office, which
makes trades to balance the bank&#8217;s assets and liabilities. The
unit made trades in credit default swaps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The losses, which could increase by $1 billion or more,
originated out of a London unit of JPMorgan&#8217;s Chief Investment
Office, which is generally responsible for managing the bank&#8217;s
interest rate, foreign currency and other economic risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company was trying to reposition a portfolio of
corporate credit derivatives and used a trading strategy that
was &#8220;flawed, complex, poorly conceived, poorly vetted and
poorly executed,&#8221; Dimon told shareholders today at the bank&#8217;s
annual meeting in Tampa, Florida. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of an investigation, the U.S. may consider
filing mail, wire and securities fraud charges, which give
prosecutors &#8220;enormous&#8221; discretion, said Ellen Podgor, a
professor at Stetson University College of Law in St.
Petersburg, Florida. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Don&#8217;t Need Much&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You don&#8217;t need much if the government decides it would
like to proceed,&#8221; Podgor said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry Hamermesh, a former lawyer with the SEC who is now a
professor at Widener University School of Law, said an
investigation into whether criminal wrongdoing occurred may take
some time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Just because things fail doesn&#8217;t mean that there&#8217;s a
crime,&#8221; Hamermesh said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the U.S. may want to scrutinize the trader who took
the position and supervisors who &#8220;bear the responsibility for
what was said to investors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These cases are not easy to win and criminal liability
under securities law depends on a show of intention to
mislead,&#8221; Hamermesh said. &#8220;If it&#8217;s simply a screw-up that&#8217;s
not going to get the government to home base with a jury.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for the bank, declined to
comment on the criminal probe. Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, declined to comment.
Robert Nardoza, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch in
Brooklyn, New York, where JPMorgan has some of its operations,
also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probe was reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon should appear before U.S.
lawmakers to explain the trades that have led to $2 billion in
losses, Senator Richard Shelby said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shelby, the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee,
said he wants a hearing to &#8220;find out what really happened&#8221;
with the trading losses disclosed last week by New York-based
JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank. That &#8220;absolutely&#8221; should
include bringing Dimon and other executives to Capitol Hill to
testify, Shelby said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Were they managing risk or were they just gambling?&#8221;
Shelby, of Alabama, said. &#8220;People ought to know.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Johnson, a South
Dakota Democrat, said yesterday that the JPMorgan disclosure was
expected to come up in the panel&#8217;s future hearings on financial
stability and the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act. JPMorgan
executives haven&#8217;t been invited to testify at this point, Sean Oblack, Johnson&#8217;s spokesman, said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan losses are likely to be addressed this week by
lawmakers and regulators at two House hearings on Dodd-Frank
implementation. No dates have been set for the Senate hearings
Johnson mentioned in his statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tudor Investment Corp., the $11
billion hedge fund run by Paul Tudor Jones, bought shares of an
exchange-traded fund that tracks financial companies, and a
stake in JPMorgan (JPM) Chase  Co., during the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tudor purchased 8.66 million shares of the Financial Select
Sector SPDR Fund, making the ETF its biggest U.S. stock holding
as of March 31, according to a filing today with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. The fund bought 1.27 million
shares of JPMorgan, making the New York-based bank its second-largest equity position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan surged 38 percent in the quarter and the Financial
Select ETF rose 22 percent as equities rallied. Shares of
JPMorgan have fallen 12 percent through yesterday since the
company disclosed a $2 billion trading loss on May 10 involving
synthetic credit derivatives. Moore Capital Management LLC, the
hedge fund founded by Louis Moore Bacon, is among rivals that
also bought shares in JPMorgan earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tudor, based in Greenwich, Connecticut, also bought 238,000
shares of the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF, according to the
filing, while selling its stakes in Virgin Media Inc., Apple

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, said its executive compensation plan won
the approval of 91.5 percent of shareholders in a non-binding
annual advisory vote, up from 73 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan announced the preliminary results today at the
company&#8217;s annual shareholder meeting in Tampa, Florida, where
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon also addressed
the $2 billion trading loss disclosed last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This should never have happened,&#8221; Dimon, 56, said at the
meeting, where about a dozen protesters stood outside carrying
signs. &#8220;I can&#8217;t justify it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board awarded $23 million in salary and bonuses to
Dimon for his 2011 performance, the same amount he received for
2010. The New York-based bank reported record net income for
2011 and its stock fell 22 percent during the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s compensation plan also awarded $14 million in
salary and bonuses to Ina Drew, 55, who resigned yesterday. Her
departure came four days after JPMorgan disclosed that the chief
investment office that Drew oversaw lost $2 billion and may lose
more. The company will consider reclaiming some of her stock
awards, according to two senior executives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All corrective action will be taken as necessary,&#8221; Dimon
said at the meeting. &#8220;Ina served the firm for more than 30
years and has been a great partner. But it&#8217;s important that we
bring in new management.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Shocking&#8217; News &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the votes on compensation and other proposals were
probably cast before the loss was announced, according to Nell Minow, co-owner and board member of GMI Ratings, a research firm
that specializes in corporate governance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that the vote will be indicative of
shareholder concerns on this issue,&#8221; Minow said. &#8220;It&#8217;s unusual
to have such shocking and bad news come in after most of the
votes have been cast.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon read a statement about the losses at the start of the
meeting and the matter was raised only in passing by
shareholders who were given an opportunity to speak. Talking to
reporters after the meeting concluded, Dimon said, &#8220;The buck
always stops with me.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISS Proxy Services USA and Glass Lewis  Co., two
shareholder advisory firms, recommended on April 30 that
JPMorgan shareholders approve the bank&#8217;s compensation plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISS said that while JPMorgan &#8220;continues to resist adopting
incentive plans with pre-established goals and long-term
objectives,&#8221; it added a feature &#8220;that provides both an
incentive for sustained performance and some mitigation against
excessive risk-taking.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholders also approved the re-election of all the
directors up for a vote, with each receiving at least 86.2
percent of the ballots cast, according to preliminary results
announced at the meeting. They defeated a proposal that would
have split the role of chairman and CEO. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Mark Walter, the chief executive
officer of Guggenheim Partners LLC, ran Chicago investment firm
Liberty Hampshire Co., a junior associate asked in 1996 why he
decided to accept money from outside investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;d rather have a small piece of an incredibly large and
successful pie than own all of nothing,&#8221; Walter said at the
time, according to the associate, Brian Friedman, who worked at
Liberty for a year and had been a student of Walter&#8217;s at the
Illinois Institute of Technology Chicago-Kent College of Law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter&#8217;s drive to expand suffered a setback last week when
talks to buy three of Deutsche Bank AG (DB)&#8217;s four asset-management
units fell apart, a deal that would have more than quintupled
Guggenheim&#8217;s assets and put it on par with the likes of Legg
Mason Inc. and Franklin Resources Inc. The two sides are still
in discussions on RREEF, a Deutsche Bank division that invests
in real estate and infrastructure and has $49 billion euros ($63
billion) under management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2000, Walter has built Guggenheim Partners from a
family office with a handful of employees into a $125 billion
global asset manager through smaller deals including the
acquisitions of Claymore Group and Rydex ETF owner Security
Benefit Corp. The 51-year-old, who shot to prominence earlier
this year as the man behind the $2.15 billion purchase of the
Los Angeles Dodgers, may seek more deals after hiring investing
veterans including Henry Silverman, the former chief operating
officer of Apollo Global Management LLC, to advise on expansion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Appetite for Expansion&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;RREEF by itself won&#8217;t satisfy Walter&#8217;s appetite for
expansion,&#8221; said Howard Tai, a senior analyst in the capital
markets group of Boston-based research firm Aite Group LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter, who spent his childhood in Cedar Rapids, Iowa,
stayed away from the spotlight before this year. He declined to
comment for this story, as did Michelle Lee, a spokeswoman for
Guggenheim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter is the controlling partner behind the Dodgers
purchase and a member of the partnership called Guggenheim
Baseball Management LLC, which includes former Los Angeles
Lakers player Magic Johnson and baseball executive Stan Kasten.
Walter, who lives in Chicago and is a Cubs season-ticket holder,
may have paid as much as $850 million more than the closest bid.
A group led by Steve Cohen, who runs SAC Capital Advisors LP,
offered the next-highest bid at $1.3 billion, a person familiar
with the situation said in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financing terms for the sale, which closed May 1, haven&#8217;t
been disclosed. The principals of Guggenheim Baseball own the
team along with member-controlled entities that contributed
capital to the purchase, according to a person familiar with the
arrangement who wasn&#8217;t authorized to speak publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sandy Koufax &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A franchise as storied as the L.A. Dodgers often trades
based on the same dynamics that a painting might trade on,&#8221;
said Steve Patterson, president of Houston-based Pro Sports
Consulting LLC, which advises professional and college teams on
transactions and media deals. &#8220;There&#8217;s only one L.A. Dodgers
franchise, only one or two cable deals and only one Sandy Koufax.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koufax, a Hall of Famer, played for the team for his full
career and is considered to be one of the sport&#8217;s best pitchers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who think Walter overpaid fail to appreciate how much
the media rights add to the franchise&#8217;s value, Patterson said.
The team&#8217;s television contract with News Corp.&#8217;s Fox Sports
expires after the 2013 season. The bidding for Dodgers rights
will &#8220;drive a number that&#8217;s never been seen before.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ETF Deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter has been a seller as well as a buyer in building his
empire. In 2006, Guggenheim sold almost 72 percent of its
alternative asset-management unit to Bank of Ireland Plc, before
buying most of it back in 2009 after the bank put it on the
market following a drop in assets under management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other transactions show he is focused on tapping into
exchange-traded funds, the fastest-growing product in the money-management industry. The firm announced the acquisitions of
Claymore Group in 2009 and Security Benefit the next year,
making it one of the 10 largest ETF providers in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guggenheim had planned to acquire the Deutsche Bank units
as a separate entity, similar to how the firm&#8217;s 2010 transaction
with Security Benefit was structured, Alan Schwartz, executive
chairman of Guggenheim, said in an April 30 interview with
Bloomberg Television at the Milken Institute Global Conference
in Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a really intelligent way to do it,&#8221; said Schwartz,
the former CEO of Bear Stearns Cos. &#8220;It will not put any
pressure, or disruption in our existing asset-management
business, which will stay focused on its customers and its
products.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Taking a Pass &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank and Guggenheim agreed to end discussions on a
potential sale of DWS Americas, DB Advisors and Deutsche
Insurance Asset Management and focus talks on RREEF, the
Frankfurt-based lender said May 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A lot of very savvy and sophisticated investors have
looked at the Deutsche Bank transaction and elected to pass,&#8221;
in part because they only wanted pieces of the disparate
business, Burton Greenwald, an independent fund consultant in
Philadelphia, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter majored in accounting at Omaha, Nebraska&#8217;s Creighton
University, whose alumni include Joe Ricketts, founder of
brokerage TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. Ricketts&#8217;s family had held
the record for the highest price paid for a Major League
Baseball team at $845 million for the Chicago Cubs and Wrigley
Field in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After college, Walter attended Northwestern University Law
School and worked in the Chicago office of law firm Sonnenschein
Nath  Rosenthal, now known as SNR Denton. He seemed well-respected by his colleagues, Scott Turow, an author and attorney
who&#8217;s been at SNR since 1986, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Big Picture&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter left the legal world for a job in finance, joining
First Chicago Capital Markets Inc., where he worked in
businesses including asset-backed securities. In 1996, Walter
and three partners from First Chicago started Liberty Hampshire,
which provided asset-backed financing for large financial
institutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first year, only about eight people were employed at
the firm, according to Friedman, who started as an intern and
stayed on as an associate while going to graduate school. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He wanted to make sure that everybody understood what the
goals were, what the specific tasks were that needed to be
accomplished and that everybody understood the big-picture
environment, regardless of what their role was,&#8221; said Friedman,
now a managing director at First Analysis Securities Corp. in
Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Laid-Back&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter was &#8220;more comfortable in a pair of jeans than he
was in a $2,000 suit,&#8221; Friedman said. &#8220;He always had an
ability to stay relaxed even in stressful situations, which made
him appear laid-back. Yet he was always thinking and
energized.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2000, Dominic Curcio, who was at Liberty Hampshire,
linked Walter with J. Todd Morley, who had a mortgage-securities
business, and Peter Lawson-Johnston II, a descendant of Meyer
Guggenheim, to form Guggenheim Partners, said a person familiar
with the relationship who asked not to be named because the
details aren&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Guggenheim family derives its wealth from Meyer, a
tailor who was born in Switzerland, came to the U.S. in the
1840s and a made a fortune in mining and smelting. Preceding
Guggenheim Partners was Guggenheim Brothers, a family office for
managing the Guggenheim family&#8217;s funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Executive Hires &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it grew, Guggenheim Partners raised money from outside
investors such as Sammons Enterprises Inc., a Dallas-based
company with interests in industrial products and insurance.
Guggenheim has more than 2,200 employees at more than 25 offices
in nine countries and offers asset management, advisory,
investment banking and capital markets services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guggenheim has beefed up its leadership to guide growth.
Walter brought in Schwartz in 2009 to help the firm expand to
full-service investment banking, Schwartz said at the time.
Silverman, who joined in March as vice chairman of the
investment-management business, would focus on the Deutsche Bank
acquisition, Schwartz said in the April 30 interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter lives in Lincoln Park, Illinois, with his wife and
10-year-old daughter, and is involved in local nonprofits,
including the Lincoln Park Zoo. Guggenheim is the main sponsor
for the zoo&#8217;s annual benefit and Walter&#8217;s wife, Kimbra, has been
on the women&#8217;s board since 2006, said Christine Zrinsky, vice
president of development for the zoo. The Walters want to be
actively involved in conversations about projects rather than
just write checks, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Good Decisions&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re very private people,&#8221; Zrinsky said. &#8220;Mark runs
his company, but everything else they do as a couple.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter supports other homegrown causes, as well as
political efforts. He gave $30,800 to the Democratic National
Committee and $5,000 to President Barack Obama last year,
according to the Center for Responsive Politics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&#8217;s a trustee of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation,
which runs museums including those in Manhattan and Bilbao,
Spain. Stephen Swid, the chairman and CEO of SCS Communications
Inc. and also a trustee, said he&#8217;s known Walter for at least 10
years and sees him at the foundation&#8217;s board meetings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter is &#8220;bright and honest,&#8221; asks the right questions
and fulfills his pledges, Swid said in a telephone interview
from his New York office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He makes good decisions and explains them,&#8221; Swid said.
&#8220;That&#8217;s an asset.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. House lawmakers, acting after
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) announced $2 billion in derivatives trading
losses, delayed a committee vote on legislation easing Dodd-Frank Act swaps rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. House Agriculture Committee postponed a May 17
committee meeting to vote on the measures, which would limit the
international reach of the 2010 regulatory-overhaul law&#8217;s swaps
regulations and allow more derivatives trading to occur in
federally insured banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As always, Washington has a tendency to overreact. While
the news of JPMorgan&#8217;s trading loss is unfortunate, the
bipartisan legislation the committee was scheduled to consider
is unrelated to the cause of the trading loss,&#8221; Representative
Frank D. Lucas, an Oklahoma Republican and chairman of the
committee, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;However, this committee will take the time to gather all
relevant information before we proceed to ensure there are no
unintended consequences of the legislation that would encourage
recklessness in our financial institutions,&#8221; Lucas said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill restricting the international scope of Dodd-Frank
rules gained bipartisan support in a separate U.S. House
committee. JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS)
have argued that applying the rules to overseas branches would
hurt their ability to compete with rivals based outside the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legislation would need passage by the full House and
Senate before it could be sent to President Barack Obama for
final approval. Neither chamber has scheduled a vote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moore Capital Management LLC, the $15
billion hedge fund founded by Louis Moore Bacon, boosted its
stake in JPMorgan (JPM) Chase  Co. before shares of the bank plunged
because of a $2 billion trading loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hedge fund, based in New York, bought about 6 million
shares of JPMorgan in the first quarter and held a stake valued
at about $297.3 million, according to a filing today with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Moore owned 450,000
shares of the New York-based bank at the end of last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of JPMorgan have fallen 12 percent through yesterday
since the company disclosed the trading loss on May 10. The
trades in synthetic credit derivatives led to the resignation of
senior managers and prompted Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon
to say the investments were &#8220;flawed, complex, poorly reviewed,
poorly executed and poorly monitored.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moore also bought 6.8 million shares of San Francisco-based
Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) valued at $233 million, according to the SEC
filing. Shares of the biggest U.S. mortgage lender have risen 18
percent this year. Moore purchased 5.2 million shares of
Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp (USB) worth $163.2 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money managers who oversee more than $100 million in U.S.
equities must file a Form 13F within 45 days of the end of each
quarter to list their holdings in stocks that trade on U.S.
exchanges, as well as options and convertible debt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive

is built to withstand unexpected incidents after the company
last week announced a $2 billion trading loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We maintain a fortress balance sheet to manage surprises
and setbacks like this,&#8221; Dimon told shareholders today at their

done here we&#8217;ll be a stronger company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM)&#8217;s. $2 billion trading loss was
a &#8220;pretty significant risk-management failure&#8221; and will prompt
close scrutiny by regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the
Securities and Exchange Commission, &#8220;are going to take a very
careful look at this incident,&#8221; Geithner said at an event today
in Washington held by the Peter G. Peterson Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56, announced
the loss May 10, assailing his firm&#8217;s handling of trading in
synthetic credit positions as &#8220;flawed, complex, poorly
reviewed, poorly executed and poorly monitored.&#8221; JPMorgan, the
biggest U.S. bank, will consider reclaiming incentive pay from
employees, including former Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew,
after her unit&#8217;s trading loss, said two senior executives who
declined to be identified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geithner said the administration&#8217;s overhaul of financial
regulations isn&#8217;t meant &#8220;to prevent the unpreventable in terms
of mistakes in judgment, but to make sure when those mistakes
happen -- and they&#8217;re inevitable -- that they&#8217;re modest enough
in size, and the system as a whole can handle them.&#8221; The loss
&#8220;points out how important it is that these reforms are strong
enough and effective enough,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SunTrust (STI) Banks Inc. Chief Executive
Officer William Rogers said the economy in the Southeast, which
has lagged behind the U.S. recovery the past three years, is
accelerating led by new construction of condominiums in Miami. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Miami is having a remarkably fast recovery,&#8221; Rogers said
in an interview in Atlanta, where the lender is based. &#8220;Florida
as a whole -- and I spend a lot of time in Florida, as you might
imagine -- I am feeling much better about.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Miami metropolitan area&#8217;s unemployment rate dropped to
8.4 percent in March from 10.6 percent a year earlier, Labor
Department figures show. Florida was one of the centers of real
estate speculation until prices began falling six years ago. The
state&#8217;s home prices dropped 49 percent from their peak to
January, the third-biggest drop after Arizona and Nevada,
according to CoreLogic, a real estate data firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While southern Florida attracted real estate investors who 
bet prices would increase unabated, buying today hasn&#8217;t raised
concerns about speculation, Rogers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is real,&#8221; he said. Buyers are &#8220;coming from Latin
America and a lot of it is Eastern European. Miami is in a
pretty good recovery mode.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other metropolitan economies in SunTrust&#8217;s regions are
rebounding, Rogers said. Housing in the Nashville, Tennessee, 
and Washington markets is &#8220;back on the upswing,&#8221; while Marco
Island and Sarasota, Florida, &#8220;are showing improvement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Treasuries investors raised bets
to the highest level in more than two months that the price of
the securities will advance, according to a weekly survey by
JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The percent of &#8220;net longs&#8221; rose the most since March 5 to
11 percentage points in the week ending yesterday from zero the
previous week. The number of outright longs rose by 9 percentage
points to 26 percent, the most since Feb. 27. The percent of
shorts decreased to 15 percent, from 17 percent. A long position
is a bet that an asset will increase in value, while a short is
a wager it will decrease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a reflection of the broader market sentiment toward
risk,&#8221; Srini Ramaswamy, a JPMorgan strategist in New York, said
by telephone. &#8220;There are concerns around Europe, around the
odds of Greece potentially exiting the European monetary Union.
That&#8217;s helping to support a flight to quality into Treasuries.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The percent of &#8220;neutrals&#8221; decreased to 59 percent from 66
percent in the same period. In the previous week, the survey was
&#8220;net neutral&#8221; for the first time since April 2. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Robert Langreth" date="May 16, 2012  6:06 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-16/pfizer-lung-drug-stops-deadly-child-cancers-in-study.html"><headline>Pfizer Lung Drug Stops Deadly Child Cancers in Study</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s Xalkori, a drug that
targets lung cancer caused by a gene defect, wiped out all signs
of malignancy in some children with different tumor types, in a
study that proves aiming treatment at genes rather than disease
sites may be more effective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings, being released today in advance of the
American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting that starts June
1, tested the medicine against rare child tumors of the nerves,
blood and soft tissue that can be driven by mutations in the ALK
gene targeted by Xalkori. The drug helped kids with all three
tumors, with the most impressive results seen in a blood cancer
called anaplastic large cell lymphoma. In these cases, all signs
of cancer vanished in 7 of 8 kids who got the drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results show how gene-targeted medicines first tested
in one cancer can rapidly be applied to other malignancies with
the same gene abnormality. By identifying the genetic drivers of
pediatric tumors, scientists may be able to take targeted drugs
already approved for adults and apply them to children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a glimpse of the new paradigm&#8221; of cancer drug
development, said Michael Link, a Stanford University pediatric
cancer specialist and president of the American Society of
Clinical Oncology, on a conference call. By understanding the
molecular drivers of the tumors, &#8220;we have the prospect of
seeing dramatic responses.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview, Link called the preliminary results
&#8220;really extraordinary.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nerve-Cell Cancer &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pfizer drug also eliminated measurable signs of cancer
in 2 of 27 kids with neuroblastoma, a rare nerve cell cancer,
who had failed standard therapy. The drug also shrank tumors in
2 of 7 children with inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, a rare
malignancy of soft tissues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial was sponsored by the government-funded Children&#8217;s
Oncology Group, a consortium of experts, children&#8217;s hospitals,
cancer centers and universities, and also received support from
New York-based Pfizer (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is far too soon to tell if any of the children are
cured, &#8220;these are very promising results for kids who
historically have had very few options and no hope,&#8221; Yael
Mosse, a pediatric oncologist at the Children&#8217;s Hospital of
Philadelphia and the study&#8217;s lead researcher, said in an
interview. &#8220;They have their whole lives ahead of them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 120 kids in the U.S. each year develop ALK-positive
lymphoma, while 100 get neuroblastoma that contains defects in
the ALK gene, Mosse said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Advanced Testing Planned &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mosse said the researchers plan to begin a final-stage
trial of the Pfizer drug in kids with lymphoma by the end of the
year. The goal is to use the Pfizer drug for all children newly
diagnosed with this type of lymphoma and replace some of the
toxic chemotherapy that is used today, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is &#8220;a major opportunity&#8221; to lessen the intensity of
chemotherapy so that cure comes at less of a cost, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zach Witt is one child who was helped by the drug, said his
mother Pam Witt, who lives in outer suburbs of Philadelphia, in
a phone interview. The 6-year-old developed lymphoma in
September 2010 and relapsed in the middle of his chemotherapy
treatment in early April of 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He soon developed high fevers and became so weak that he
couldn&#8217;t make it to the hospital playroom just down the hall
from his room, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors at the Children&#8217;s Hospital of Philadelphia gave her
and her husband a choice of putting Zach on a more toxic chemo
regimen or going into the trial of Xalkori. They chose the
Xalkori. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Being a Kid Again &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the third day on the drug, Zach was running to the
hospital playroom, she said. Today he is out of the hospital,
and &#8220;does everything any other kid would do,&#8221; she said. He is
so energetic he recently went on a 21-mile bike ride with his
father, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think Zach would be here&#8221; without the Pfizer
drug, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Child and adult cancer drug testing &#8220;used to operate in
separate universes,&#8221; said Rob Sweetman, a senior director at
Pfizer&#8217;s cancer unit. &#8220;Now we understand these molecular
drivers that are connecting these two that weren&#8217;t as obvious
before.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweetman said Pfizer is carefully monitoring the progress
of the child trials and will make a determination whether to
seek regulatory approval for the child uses when more data is
available. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. House of Representatives
passed its version of legislation to reauthorize the Violence
Against Women Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House today passed the bill, 222-205, on a mostly
party-line vote. Democrats criticized the Republican-written
measure as part of the party&#8217;s &#8220;war on women.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They don&#8217;t want to hear us talk about the war on women,
but this is a direct assault on women&#8217;s lives,&#8221; Gwen Moore, a
Wisconsin Democrat, said before the vote. Moore, who sponsored a
proposal similar to a bill passed by the Democratic-dominated
Senate, said she was once raped. Democrats said the Republican
proposal would force immigrant victims to choose between staying
with their abusers and risking deportation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama&#8217;s administration prefers the Senate-passed version, S. 1925, and his administration threatened a
veto of the House bill. Six Democrats joined 216 Republicans in
voting for the House bill, while 23 Republicans and 182
Democrats opposed it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both parties put female lawmakers at the forefront of the
debate. Republican Sandy Adams, a freshman lawmaker from central
Florida who was a deputy sheriff before coming to Congress,
sponsored the House bill. Adams said she had personal experience
with the victims the bill is meant to aid, and that her first
marriage was an abusive relationship from which she escaped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;I Am Offended&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have sat quietly and tried to behave here but I am
offended when I hear that this does not protect victims,&#8221; Adams
said. &#8220;As someone who has been in the situation, who has been
on the scenes of these crimes, we are trying to reauthorize
something that&#8217;s very important to victims. Victims, not
politics.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1994 Violence Against Women Act and later
reauthorizations of the law have easily passed both chambers of
Congress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grants to women&#8217;s shelters and police training weren&#8217;t
at issue, as the House and Senate versions would authorize
spending of about $660 million annually. Instead, the debate
centered on immigration visas for victims of domestic violence,
gay rights and which party would be the best choice for women
voters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House bill would curtail special visas reserved for
immigrant victims of abuse who cooperate with law enforcement.
Current law allows such visas to be used as a start toward legal
permanent residence or citizenship. The House measure would
block that path to citizenship in almost all circumstances
unless the accused person is deported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Inexcusable&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Senate, a group of Senate Democrats joined with
House colleagues in calling for action on the Senate bill, which
passed that chamber on a 68-31 vote April 26. Every woman in the
Senate, and almost a third of Republicans, supported it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What is happening in the House is inexcusable,&#8221; said
Senator Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat. She said the House
bill wouldn&#8217;t provide adequate help for groups including
immigrants, gays and college students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With each chamber rejecting the other&#8217;s plan, the competing
Violence Against Women Acts would have to be merged before
becoming law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House bill is H.R. 4970. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. lender by assets, will eliminate 20 investment-banking jobs
in London as market conditions weaken, according to a person
with knowledge of the cuts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The staff cuts aren&#8217;t related to the $2 billion loss at the
New York-based company&#8217;s chief investment office in London, said
the person, who asked for anonymity because the investment bank
reductions haven&#8217;t been made public. The firm has about 8,000
employees in the London investment bank, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders are trimming staff amid pressure to cut expenses as
new revenue becomes scarce and regulators demand more capital.
Banks pulled back from making new loans to package into bonds as
Europe&#8217;s debt crisis roiled credit markets. Trading revenue from
securitized products at the 10 biggest global investment banks
dropped to about $10 billion last year from about $17.5 billion
in 2010, according to data from consultant Coalition Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan eliminated some senior mortgage traders and
salespersons in the U.S. investment bank earlier this year,
according to people with direct knowledge of the moves. The firm
also dismissed about 5 percent of its equities traders and sales
staff on March 20 and cut about 100 employees in its treasury
and securities services unit in January, according to three
people with knowledge of those moves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sticking With Iksil &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank continues to employ Bruno Iksil, the trader known
as the London Whale whose positions may have distorted prices in
some derivatives markets. Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for the
New York-based firm, confirmed Iksil&#8217;s status. The New York
Times reported earlier that Iksil is leaving JPMorgan by the end
of this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News first reported April 5 that Iksil had
accumulated derivatives that track the financial health of
corporations, and that the holdings were so large that they
distorted prices. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon later
disclosed a $2 billion trading loss that he attributed to an
&#8220;egregious&#8221; failure at the chief investment office in London,
where Iksil works. Ina Drew, who ran the CIO, retired days after
the loss became public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A call to Iksil in London was referred to the public
relations office. JPMorgan fell 1.2 percent to $35.82 at 2:52
p.m. in New York. The stock has gained 7.7 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) shareholders
sued the bank and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon in two
separate cases over the company&#8217;s $2 billion trading loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Arizona trust filed a securities-fraud lawsuit in which
it seeks to represent all investors who lost money on the stock
as a result of alleged misstatements by the bank about its
losses. In the second case, an individual investor asked for
damages on behalf of the company from Dimon, the bank&#8217;s board
and other executives. Both suits were filed late yesterday in
Manhattan federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fraud suit, the trust seeks damages for investors
who bought JPMorgan stock from April 13, when Dimon called
concerns over the bank&#8217;s trading risk &#8220;a complete tempest in a
teapot,&#8221; to May 10, when he disclosed the trading loss
publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The trades in question, however, were anything but a
tempest in a teapot, and quickly went from bad to worse,&#8221;
according to the complaint filed by Saratoga Advantage Trust --
Financial Services Portfolio, based in Goodyear, Arizona.
&#8220;During the week following the April 13 conference call, losses
from the trades ballooned to as much as $200 million per day.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the action seeking damages on behalf of the company,
called a shareholder derivative suit, the plaintiff claims
JPMorgan executives and directors permitted a radical change in
the bank&#8217;s exposure to undisclosed investment risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dimon Statement Cited &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The defendant Dimon went so far as to publicly and
vigorously dispute that any investment safety regulation was
necessary for financial institutions such as JPMorgan, because
the company was purportedly so careful with its investments that
no such regulations would be necessary,&#8221; James Baker, a
California resident, said in his complaint. &#8220;All of the
individual defendants knew this was simply not the case.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to
comment on the lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shareholder fraud suit seeks unspecified damages on
behalf of investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The derivative suit seeks unspecified damages from the
officers and directors for the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also asks for a court order requiring that JPMorgan
improve corporate governance by allowing its shareholders to
vote on proposals to strengthen board supervision, to install
two shareholder representatives on the board, to test internal
audit and control policies and to ensure that management be
immediately informed about unacceptable trading risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Credit Products &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trading losses came on synthetic credit products, which
are derivatives tied to credit performance. In disclosing the
$2 billion loss on transactions he said were intended to manage
risk, Dimon cited &#8220;egregious&#8221; failures by the bank&#8217;s chief
investment office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan named Matt Zames to lead the office, succeeding
Ina Drew, who retired May 14 amid news of the $2 billion loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan fell 21 cents to $36.03 at 1:50 p.m. in New York.
The stock advanced 23 percent this year before the losses were
disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Baker v. Dimon, 12-cv-03878, and Saratoga
Advantage Trust -- Financial Services Portfolio, 12-cv-03879,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Comptroller of the Currency
Thomas Curry, whose agency is the main regulator for JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s North American bank, said that operational risks
are eclipsing credit risk as the regulator&#8217;s chief concern. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without naming JPMorgan specifically, Curry said that
operational risk -- the risk of loss from failures by people and
bank processes -- is &#8220;high and increasing&#8221; and made worse when
bank procedures are most complex. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some of our most seasoned supervisors, people with 30 or
more years of experience in some cases, tell me that this is the
first time they have seen operational risk eclipse credit risk
as a safety and soundness challenge,&#8221; Curry said in remarks
prepared for delivery today before the Exchequer Club of
Washington. &#8220;Rising operational risk concerns them, it concerns
me, and it should concern you.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curry said the OCC, which regulates U.S. national banks,
has seen faulty management of the &#8220;interrelationship of risks
in different markets on the value of the institution&#8217;s assets&#8221;
and that the agency has too often seen &#8220;conspicuous and
expensive examples of the toll that one form of operational risk
-- flawed risk models -- can take.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This speech, a week after JPMorgan&#8217;s Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon said the bank made &#8220;egregious&#8221; mistakes
and had so far lost about $2 billion tied to synthetic credit
securities, is the first scheduled by Curry since being
confirmed by the Senate last month to become Comptroller of the
Currency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Breakdown of Control&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bryan Hubbard, an OCC spokesman, said yesterday that the
agency does not &#8220;approve specific models&#8221; or trades at the
banks it oversees, including JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. He said
the agency focuses on &#8220;risk management policies, processes,
procedures, limits and controls&#8221; and in the case of JPMorgan
are looking to see whether a &#8220;breakdown of control&#8221; caused the
bank&#8217;s activities to swing far from expectations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The primary bank regulators are at fault here for not
anticipating this better and short-circuiting the risk-taking
better, and they have to own up to that responsibility and be
accountable,&#8221; said David Hendler, an analyst at CreditSights
Inc., a New York-based research firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his speech, Curry also cited third-party relationships
and anti-money laundering compliance as frequent points of
operational risk at banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All institutions, regardless of size, must resist the
temptation to under-invest in the systems and controls they need
to prevent greater risk and larger losses in the future,&#8221; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and regulators
may face increasing pressure to explain the lender&#8217;s $2 billion
trading loss as the misstep becomes fodder for lawmakers still
haggling over a regulatory overhaul enacted two years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A day after JPMorgan Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Jamie Dimon told shareholders there was no justification for the
&#8220;egregious mistakes&#8221; by the biggest and most profitable U.S.
bank, Federal Reserve and Treasury Department officials faced
lawmakers amid conflict over the meaning of the losses at a
House hearing on systemically important financial firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is no doubt that this week&#8217;s news of JPMorgan&#8217;s
trading losses has raised significant questions about the
supervision of risk,&#8221; said Representative Shelley Moore Capito,
the West Virginia Republican leading today&#8217;s hearing of her
House Financial Services subcommittee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel&#8217;s inquiry, scheduled before Dimon disclosed the
loss on May 10, deals with a Dodd-Frank Act designation that
will impose higher capital standards and more regulatory
scrutiny on firms whose collapse could imperil the economy. It
follows calls by lawmakers for formal review of JPMorgan&#8217;s
trades, with Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, the Senate
Banking Committee&#8217;s top Republican, saying Dimon &#8220;absolutely&#8221;
should be called to testify before his panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Political Split &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The politics underlying the debate have split lawmakers by
party lines, with Democrats including Senator Carl Levin using
the loss to bolster the case for tighter restrictions on banks.
Representative Spencer Bachus, the Alabama Republican who leads
the Financial Services panel, pushed back against that view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are again hearing from some of our colleagues that we
need a law which will essentially prevent a business from losing
money or taking risk,&#8221; Bachus said. &#8220;No law can do that, nor
should a law prevent a company from taking risks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless the &#8220;facts are diametrically different&#8221; from what
lawmakers have been told, depositors and taxpayers aren&#8217;t at
risk from the bank&#8217;s loss, Bachus said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While neither house of Congress has set hearings dedicated
to JPMorgan&#8217;s disclosure, today&#8217;s comments by lawmakers show the
New York-based bank won&#8217;t escape the Washington spotlight.
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Johnson, a South Dakota
Democrat, said he&#8217;s planning hearings on financial stability and
Dodd-Frank implementation that will give lawmakers a chance to
address the issue with regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;All the Facts&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers from both parties and both chambers are calling
for reviews and hearings. Representative Michael Capuano, a
Massachusetts Democrat who sits on the House Financial Services
Oversight and Investigations panel, requested a hearing on the
issue last week. Bachus, in a statement yesterday, said he will
set a hearing on the public-policy implications of the loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we know what all the facts are,&#8221; Senator
John Cornyn, a Texas Republican and chairman of the National
Republican Senatorial Committee, said yesterday. &#8220;Certainly I
would support the call for an investigation to find out.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As lawmakers question regulators, JPMorgan is responding by
reaching out. The bank&#8217;s Washington operation has deployed
representatives to brief House and Senate staff members on the
strategy that led to the losses, according to three
congressional aides familiar with the briefings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Volcker Rule &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussions have emphasized that the trades were meant
to hedge risk -- not as proprietary trades targeted by Dodd-Frank&#8217;s Volcker rule -- and that JPMorgan is conducting an
internal audit to identify failures and wrongdoing, according to
the aides who participated in or were informed of the briefings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has had a strong presence on Capitol Hill,
spending $7.6 million on lobbying in 2011, almost $2 million in
the first quarter of this year and distributing more than
$340,000 in campaign contributions from its federal political
action committee since the start of 2011. Much of that money is
directed to House and Senate leadership and lawmakers on the
Senate Banking and House Financial Services (HIG) panels, according to
federal filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s Washington office has dedicated resources for
responding to lawmakers&#8217; inquiries, according to a person with
knowledge of the bank&#8217;s strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Treasury, Fed &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasury and Fed officials were the first to face lawmakers
poised to probe JPMorgan as Lance Auer, Treasury&#8217;s deputy
assistant secretary for financial institutions, and Michael
Gibson, director of the Fed&#8217;s Division of Banking Supervision
and Regulation, testified before Capito&#8217;s panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full Financial Services Committee is scheduled to hear
tomorrow from Securities and Exchange Commission Enforcement
Director Robert Khuzami, Fed General Counsel Scott Alvarez and
top lawyers from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency. Lawmakers said yesterday
they were preparing questions specifically about the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I certainly expect that the losses at JPMorgan Chase will
be something we talk about,&#8221; said Representative Brad Miller, a
North Carolina Democrat who said he plans to use the bank&#8217;s
disclosure to drive discussion over whether to force the break
up of the largest financial institutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, who had his pay package of $23 million in salary and
bonus for his 2011 performance approved yesterday by 91.5
percent of shareholders, told investors in Tampa yesterday that
the bank has a &#8220;fortress balance sheet to manage surprises and
setbacks like this.&#8221; Still, he said, the losses &#8220;never should
have happened. I can&#8217;t justify it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with Dimon&#8217;s expressions of contrition and removal of
executives responsible for the loss, lawmakers said scrutiny of
JPMorgan is unlikely to let up any time soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have the greatest respect for Jamie Dimon, I like him,
but this is a bad deal,&#8221; Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds Moore Capital Management
LLC and Blue Ridge Capital LLC boosted their stakes in JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) in the first quarter, while Kingdon Capital
Management LLC divested, before the shares plunged because of a
$2 billion trading loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moore, the $15 billion fund in New York run by Louis Moore Bacon, bought 6 million shares of JPMorgan, making the $297.3
million stake its largest U.S. stock holding as of March 31,
according to a filing yesterday with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. John Griffin&#8217;s New York-based Blue Ridge purchased
1.85 million shares, raising its stake in the bank to 6.14
million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has slumped 21 percent since the end of the first
quarter, including an 11 percent decline following the company&#8217;s
May 10 disclosure of losses tied to synthetic credit
derivatives. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said the New
York-based bank made &#8220;egregious mistakes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal regulators are examining what happened, including
the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission, according to
people familiar with the probes. The U.S. Justice Department and
Federal Bureau of Investigation in New York have also begun a
criminal probe, a person familiar with the matter said
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Omega Advisors Inc., Leon Cooperman&#8217;s New York hedge fund,
bought 1.34 million shares of JPMorgan, raising its stake in the
bank to 2.22 million, according to a May 14 filing. Tudor
Investment Corp., the $11.1 billion hedge fund run by Paul Tudor Jones in Greenwich, Connecticut, purchased 1.27 million shares,
making the bank its second-largest equity position, according to
a filing yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was the second-most purchased U.S. stock by hedge
funds in the first quarter after Medco Health Solutions Inc.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Citigroup Inc., based
in New York, was the fifth-most purchased stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was the fourth-largest stock holding among hedge
funds after technology firms Apple Inc., Google Inc. and
Microsoft Corp., the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Soros, Singh &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billionaire George Soros&#8217;s New York-based investment firm,
Soros Fund Management LLC, bought 606,400 JPMorgan shares in the
quarter, according to a filing yesterday. TPG-Axon Capital
Management LP, Dinakar Singh&#8217;s hedge fund in New York, added
520,000 shares, bringing its holding to 3.13 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Odey Asset Management LLP, the London-based hedge fund
founded by Crispin Odey, added almost 148,000 JPMorgan shares,
increasing its position to 2.39 million, according to a filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other funds that boosted to their stakes in the first
quarter include Adage Capital Management LP in Boston, Caxton
Associates LP in New York and AQR Capital Management LLC in
Greenwich, Connecticut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds that cut their JPMorgan holdings include
London-based Lansdowne Partners LP, which sold almost 6.6
million shares, leaving it with 17.5 million, according to a
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maverick Capital Management LP,  Lee Ainslie&#8217;s fund that
has offices in Dallas and New York, reported selling 3.7 million
shares of the bank, leaving it about 4.7 million. Eminence
Capital LLC, based in New York, also cut its stake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kingdon Capital, run by Mark Kingdon in New York, sold its
entire position of 2 million shares, according to a filing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bankers from around the world told
the Internal Revenue Service that proposed U.S. rules requiring
reporting of Americans&#8217; overseas bank accounts are too
burdensome and must be changed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Barkin, managing director and head of U.S. tax at
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. told a Washington panel the
rules need to be &#8220;streamlined and simplified significantly&#8221; so
they can be understood by bank employees who do not speak
English. Barkin spoke on behalf of the Institute of
International Bankers at an IRS hearing yesterday in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules implement the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act,
a 2010 law designed to make it more difficult for U.S. citizens
to hide money outside the country. Many provisions of the law
take effect in 2013, and overseas banks will be required to tell
the IRS annually about the balances and activity in their U.S.
customers&#8217; accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the law, some Asian banks have started turning
away U.S. customers, and financial institutions from Japan,
Switzerland, Australia and Brazil have lodged concerns with the
U.S. Many argue that the U.S. is outsourcing its tax compliance
to banks around the world and imposing rules that conflict with
local laws and regulations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the law, the U.S. will impose a 30 percent tax on
some U.S.-related payments being sent to financial institutions
outside the country that don&#8217;t comply with the rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives of the Swiss Bankers Association, the
Japanese Securities Dealers Association and the Financial
Services Council of Australia spoke at yesterday&#8217;s hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NYC Council to Require Banks to Disclose, Report to Community &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks holding New York City treasury funds will be required
to disclose their investments and business practices in
neighborhoods under a law passed yesterday by the City Council. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measure also creates a community-investment advisory
board in the Finance Department that would use census data to
review banks&#8217; branch locations, loans, delinquencies and
foreclosures. Officials can use the information to determine
whether the city should deposit its funds there, according to
the text of the bill. It passed 44 to 4, with three members
absent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayor Michael Bloomberg has said he intends to veto the
bill, even though the council has enough votes to override such
a move. The New York Bankers Association also opposed the bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mayor is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News
parent Bloomberg LP. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Elia System Operator Sees Positive Changes in German Rules &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elia System Operator NV (ELI), the operator of electricity grids
in Belgium and eastern Germany, said changes that took effect
within the German regulatory framework will have &#8220;positive
consequences.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elia cited the switch to paying fair remuneration in the
year of investment, allowing offshore investments to be
depreciated over a shorter period of 20 years and enabling the
regulator and federal government to enforce permits for grid
expansions that are of national and European importance,
according to a statement posted on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bonus Curbs May Be Required to Win Basel Law Deal, Borg Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank bonus curbs may need to be accepted by European Union
governments as part of a compromise deal with lawmakers on how
to implement Basel capital rules in the region, Swedish Finance
Minister Anders Borg said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Parliament is pushing for limits on bonuses to
be included in the legislation, amid warnings from lenders that
the move would make it harder for them to attract top talent.
Borg said governments may have to yield to the parliament&#8217;s
demand in exchange for tougher capital rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first round of talks between members of the assembly
and Denmark, which holds the EU&#8217;s six-month rotating presidency,
is scheduled for May 23. The parliament will make bonuses a
priority in the talks, Danish Economy Minister Margrethe
Vestager told reporters yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Osborne Says Way Clear for U.K. to Begin Vickers Bank Overhaul &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said there
is &#8220;political agreement&#8221; on bank capital rules among European
Union members after securing concessions that will allow Britain
to toughen requirements on its banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Osborne said the agreement means Britain can begin
legislation to implement the recommendations of the Independent
Commission on Banking led by former Bank of England Chief
Economist John Vickers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Osborne argued at a 16-hour meeting earlier this month for
member states to gain additional flexibility to toughen rules
for their banks. His concern then was that proposals could
prevent the U.K. from fully implementing a rule overhaul for its
lenders recommended by Vickers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vickers wants banks to erect firewalls around their retail
operations and increase the amount of capital they hold to
protect them from future financial crises. His proposals would
see some banks forced to hold core reserves of 10 percent of
their risk-weighted assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special Section: JPMorgan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Seen as Main Topic at Hearings on Dodd-Frank Rules &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and regulators may face increasing
pressure to explain the lender&#8217;s $2 billion trading loss as the
misstep becomes fodder for lawmakers still haggling over a
regulatory overhaul enacted two years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A day after JPMorgan Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Jamie Dimon told shareholders there was no justification for the
&#8220;egregious mistakes&#8221; by the biggest and most profitable U.S.
bank, officials from the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department
could be questioned on what regulators knew and when they knew
it at a House hearing on systemically important financial
institutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hearing, scheduled before Dimon disclosed the loss on
May 10, deals with a Dodd-Frank Act designation that will impose
higher capital standards and more regulatory scrutiny on firms
whose collapse could imperil the economy. Senator Richard Shelby
of Alabama, the Senate Banking Committee&#8217;s top Republican, said
Dimon &#8220;absolutely&#8221; should be called to testify before his
panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though lawmakers haven&#8217;t set hearings specifically
dedicated to JPMorgan&#8217;s losses, the bank probably won&#8217;t escape
the Washington spotlight. Lawmakers from both parties and both
chambers are calling for dedicated investigations and hearings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As lawmakers prepare to question regulators, JPMorgan is
responding by reaching out to Capitol Hill. The bank&#8217;s
Washington operation has deployed representatives to brief House
and Senate staff members on the strategy that led to the losses,
according to three congressional aides familiar with the
briefings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more, click here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.S. Said to Start Probe of $2 Billion JPMorgan Trading Loss &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation in New York have begun a criminal probe of
JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s $2 billion trading loss, a person
familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. is looking into what if any criminal wrongdoing
occurred in relation to the losses the bank reported last week,
said the person, who declined to be identified because the
matter isn&#8217;t public. The inquiry is in its most preliminary
stage, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates
derivatives trading, are also examining New York-based
JPMorgan&#8217;s trading activities, according to people familiar with
those probes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said on May 10
that the bank made &#8220;egregious&#8221; mistakes and that the losses of
about $2 billion tied to synthetic credit securities were
&#8220;self-inflicted.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for the bank, declined to
comment on the criminal probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney
Preet Bharara, declined to comment. Robert Nardoza, a spokesman
for U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch in Brooklyn, where JPMorgan has
some of its operations, also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probe was reported earlier yesterday by the Wall Street
Journal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, U.S. House lawmakers, acting after JPMorgan
Chase  Co. announced $2 billion in derivatives trading losses,
delayed a committee vote on legislation easing Dodd-Frank Act
swaps rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. House Agriculture Committee postponed a May 17
committee meeting to vote on the measures, which would limit the
international reach of the 2010 regulatory-overhaul law&#8217;s swaps
regulations and allow more derivatives trading to occur in
federally insured banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill restricting the international scope of Dodd-Frank
rules gained bipartisan support in a separate U.S. House
committee. JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS)
have argued that applying the rules to overseas branches would
hurt their ability to compete with rivals based outside the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legislation would need passage by the full House and
Senate before being sent to the White House for final approval.
Neither chamber has scheduled a vote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dimon as New York Fed Director Renews Conflicts Concern &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $2 billion trading loss at JPMorgan Chase  Co. has
revived concern that its regulator, the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York, is too cozy with Wall Street. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon is one of
three bankers sitting on the board of the New York Fed, as
required by law. While directors play no part in bank
supervision, Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat running for U.S.
Senate from Massachusetts, called for Dimon&#8217;s removal from the
district bank board. Senator Bernard Sanders, a Vermont
Independent, said he sees a conflict in Dimon&#8217;s two roles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed governance came under scrutiny after taxpayer-funded
bailouts during the 2008 financial crisis sparked a political
backlash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack Gutt, a spokesman for the New York Fed, declined to
comment on Dimon&#8217;s role on the board. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Geithner Says Regulators to Scrutinize JPMorgan Loss &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner talked about
JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s $2 billion trading loss, financial
regulation and fiscal debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He spoke at the Peter G. Peterson Foundation&#8217;s 2012 Fiscal
Summit in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Isaac Says Scrutiny of Bank Capital Requirements Needed &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Isaac, chairman of Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) and a former
chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., talked about
the outlook for increased banking regulation following JPMorgan
Chase  Co.&#8217;s $2 billion trading loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac spoke with Scarlet Fu, Stephanie Ruhle and Erik
Schatzker on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;InBusiness.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cardinal Settles With DEA for Two-Year Shipping Suspension &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cardinal Health Inc. (CAH), the second-largest U.S. drug
distributor by revenue, agreed to suspend shipments of
controlled drugs from a Florida facility for two years in a
settlement with the Drug Enforcement Administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal officials had challenged Dublin, Ohio-based
Cardinal&#8217;s procedures, contending the Lakeland, Florida, center
posed a public safety threat by shipping large quantities of the
prescription painkiller oxycodone to pharmacies. The agency
alleged the company failed to make sure the drugs went to
legitimate patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement averts the need for months of administrative
proceedings and appeals to restore the license. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cardinal said in a statement yesterday announcing the
settlement that it agreed to improve &#8220;anti-diversion
procedures&#8221; to keep better control of narcotics companywide. It
also said the DEA is planning &#8220;no further administrative
actions at other Cardinal Health facilities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barbara Carreno, a DEA spokeswoman, couldn&#8217;t immediately
comment on the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Talvivaara Faces Tighter Emission Rules for Finnish Nickel Mine &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talvivaara Mining Co. (TALV) faces tougher rules on discharges
suspected of turning nearby lakes saline, potentially adding to
the costs of running its Finnish nickel mine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s nickel mine emissions of sulfate, sodium and
manganese into nearby lakes have caused protests from
environmental groups and local residents, adding to pressure on
authorities to cut permitted emission levels. Environment
Minister Ville Niinistoe has signaled the Espoo, Finland-based
company ultimately faces losing its license to operate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I expect the new emission rules will be sensible, taking
into account the environment and the prerequisites of our
operation,&#8221; Pekka Perae, chairman of the board and founder of
Talvivaara, said by phone yesterday. He declined to comment on
how much the tighter regulations could cost the company and said
he &#8220;isn&#8217;t worried&#8221; about the threat of shutdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talvivaara&#8217;s discharges into lakes in the vicinity of its
mine, including Salminen, Laakajaervi and Kivijaervi, have
caused the formation of saline layers on lake bottoms,
potentially posing a threat to local wildlife. The police are
investigating the emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The review of Talvivaara&#8217;s environment permit for the
Sotkamo nickel mine in Northern Finland starts at the end of the
month and new guidelines should be in force by year end, said
Sami Koivula, an environmental councilor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;South African Banks Ready for Basel Changes, Moody&#8217;s Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Africa&#8217;s banks are well-capitalized and prepared for
Basel III regulations, according to Moody&#8217;s Investors Service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quality of the lenders&#8217; assets remains an &#8220;issue&#8221; for
Moody&#8217;s, analyst Nondas Nicolaides said in a presentation in
Johannesburg today. Bad debts may rise when interest rates
increase, and the bulk of non-performing loans are mortgages, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basel III international rules will come into effect over
the next six years, requiring banks to hold enough capital to
survive market turmoil without causing risk to the financial
system. Moody&#8217;s downgraded credit ratings on South Africa&#8217;s five
largest banks in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growth of unsecured lending in South Africa doesn&#8217;t
pose a &#8220;systemic&#8221; risk, Nicolaides said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Whistle-Blower Sues for Records, Alleging Outsourced SEC Review &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation were sued in California to obtain
records related to the agencies&#8217; scrutiny of an energy company
in that state, BNA reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the complaint, Rodolfo Michelon asserted that in
January, he filed a whistle-blower complaint with the SEC
alleging that his employer, Sempra Energy, committed
&#8220;numerous&#8221; books and record violations in connection with gas
distribution customers in Mexico. Michelon sued the agencies to
obtain documents, alleging that the SEC violated federal
securities laws, including the whistle-blower provisions, by
&#8220;outsourcing&#8221; the investigation to two law firms, according to
BNA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michelon claims he has the right to see the documents under
the Freedom of Information Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Rodolfo Michelon v. U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission, 3:12-cv-01014, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of California (San Diego). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;BGC Executive Verrier Banned by U.K. FSA Over Broker Poaching &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthony Verrier, the executive managing director of the
inter-dealer brokerage BGC Partners Inc. (BGCP), was banned by the U.K.
finance regulator because of his involvement in poaching brokers
from a competitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verrier isn&#8217;t fit to work in the finance industry in
Britain because of a court&#8217;s finding that he induced brokers at
Tullett Prebon Plc (TLPR) to breach their employment contracts, the
Financial Services Authority said in a statement today. Verrier
is appealing the regulator&#8217;s decision and will have the case
heard at a tribunal in London, the regulator said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tullett, based in London, sued BGC in 2009 claiming Verrier
spent millions of pounds to persuade the heads of various
Tullett trading desks to breach their contracts by getting
colleagues to defect to BGC. A U.K. court in 2010 ruled against
New York-based BGC and ordered a second trial on damages, which
was later settled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verrier didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a request for comment
left at his office. BGC&#8217;s press office didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL) and five book publishers
lost their bid to have a private antitrust lawsuit over
electronic book pricing dismissed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan yesterday
denied a request by the defendants to throw out the complaint by
plaintiffs seeking to represent a class of consumers. They claim
Apple and the publishers violated federal and California state
law by conspiring to raise the price of e-books. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, the U.S. government sued Cupertino, California-based Apple and the publishers, Hachette SA, HarperCollins,
Macmillan, Penguin Group and Simon  Schuster, claiming they
broke the law in setting prices for e-books. Cote is overseeing
the government suit and private antitrust suits filed in federal
court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re: Electronic Books Antitrust Litigation,

&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), the U.K.&#8217;s second-biggest drugmaker,
shouldn&#8217;t get a further reduction in an antitrust fine of 52.5
million euros ($67.5 million), an adviser to the European
Union&#8217;s highest court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan Mazak, the advocate general to the EU&#8217;s Court of

&lt;p&gt;According to a 2005 antitrust decision, the company misled
patent officials and flouted antitrust rules to block a generic
version of its Prilosec heartburn medicine. Prilosec was the
world&#8217;s best-selling drug in the late 1990s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010, a lower court ruling cut AstraZeneca&#8217;s fine from
the 60 million euros initially levied by EU regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The General Court correctly examined all the elements
relevant to the calculation of the fine,&#8221; Mazak said in the
opinion. The higher court shouldn&#8217;t &#8220;substitute, on grounds of
fairness, its own assessment&#8221; to replace the legal reasoning
underpinning the previous ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mazak also advised the court to reject challenges from
regulators, AstraZeneca and the European Federation of
Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations, or EFPIA, an
industry group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission, the region&#8217;s antitrust regulator,
has said AstraZeneca blocked cheaper versions from 1993 to 2000
to keep prices high. AstraZeneca provided the patent offices in
Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and the U.K.
with incorrect data to extend patent protection on Prilosec,
according to the EU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca is &#8220;disappointed&#8221; with the legal adviser&#8217;s
opinion that its appeal should be dismissed, said Sarah
Lindgreen, a spokeswoman for the company. AstraZeneca takes
&#8220;compliance with all laws seriously&#8221; and has &#8220;a fundamental
commitment to doing business in an ethical and proper manner,&#8221;
she said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is C-457/10 P AstraZeneca v Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Novartis, Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth Seek Delay in Hemophilia Patents Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diagnostics unit of Novartis AG (NOVN) and Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s Wyeth
filed a joint motion on May 14 to stay the deadlines in a drug-patent trial scheduled to begin June 4 in Texas, saying that the
delay &#8220;is expected to facilitate closure in this matter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novartis sued Wyeth and Bayer AG (BAYN) in 2008, saying their
drugs violated patents related to treatments for hemophilia.
Novartis and Bayer settled their case in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics Inc. v.
Wyeth, 2:08-cv-00067, U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of Texas (Marshall). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Austria, Slovenia to Settle Smoked Sausage Squabble, APA Reports &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Austria is set to settle a dispute over plans by its
southern neighbor Slovenia to protect the name of a sausage
popular in both nations, the Austrian Press Agency reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Austria&#8217;s Agriculture Minister Nikolaus Berlakovich and his
Slovene colleague Franc Bogovic reached a compromise in the
dispute, APA said, citing the Austrian ministry. An experts&#8217;
commission will meet next week to work out the deal, the agency
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slovenia will pursue its plan to restrict the right to sell
the smoked pork sausage under its traditional name --&#8220;Kranjska
klobasa&#8221; in Slovenia or &#8220;Krainer Wurst&#8221; in Austria -- under
European Union regulations that also protect Italian Parma ham
or Greek Feta cheese. Under the deal the ministers reached,
Austrian producers would still be allowed to use the name
Kaesekrainer for a variety of the sausage that contains bits of
cheese and is the most popular in Austria. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Austria and Slovenia, both part of the Austro-Hungarian
Empire before World War I, are embroiled in several disputes
over their common cultural heritage. A 56-year debate over
minority rights for ethnic Slovenes in southern Austria ended
with a deal for dual-language road signs only last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nationalist Austrian politicians including the late Joerg Haider objected to the use of some motifs on Slovenia&#8217;s euro
coins, arguing Slovenia was misusing Austrian symbols. Austria
gained a protected status like the one sought for the sausages
by Slovenia for pumpkin seed oil, which is equally popular and
traditional in Slovenia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;In the Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activision Seeks Delay as &#8216;Warfare&#8217; Trial Claims Hit $1 Billion &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI) is seeking to delay a trial
against the creators of its blockbuster game &#8220;Call of Duty:
Modern Warfare 2&#8221; to bring in a new lead lawyer as the possible
damages it faces have ballooned to $1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activision asked California Superior Court Judge Elihu Berle in Los Angeles in a filing May 14 to postpone the May 29
trial date for 30 days so that its new attorney, Beth Wilkinson,
can get prepared. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Modern Warfare 2,&#8221; was released in November 2009, and
broke all sales records in the entertainment industry, selling
4.7 million copies in the U.S. and U.K. Activision, based in
Santa Monica, California, surpassed Electronic Arts, based in
Redwood City, California, as the biggest U.S. video-game
publisher by revenue in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activision contends Electronic Arts conspired with Jason
West and Vince Zampella, the developers of &#8220;Modern Warfare 2&#8221;
as early as July of 2009 to disrupt its &#8220;Call of Duty&#8221;
franchise, according to Activision&#8217;s December 2010 amended
cross-complaint. The company fired the two men in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activision has agreed to pay $42 million to a group of
former employees who left in 2010 after West and Zampella were
fired and who filed their own lawsuit for unpaid bonuses and
royalties for their work on &#8220;Modern Warfare 2,&#8221; a person
familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The payment of the so-called first-quarter launch bonuses
aren&#8217;t a settlement and the group of 40 former employees are
still part of the case going to trial, said the person who
didn&#8217;t want to be identified because the payments haven&#8217;t been
disclosed in a public record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bruce Isaacs, a lawyer for the former employees, declined
to comment on the payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a hearing, Richard Kendall, a lawyer for Electronic
Arts, said &#8220;Activision had the gears in motion already to fire
these guys well before EA surfaced in any way as communicating
with West and Zampella or any of their representatives.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is West v. Activision, SC107041, California
Superior Court (Los Angeles County). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Amylin Said to Attract Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Sanofi in Sale &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc. has lured suitors such as
Pfizer Inc., AstraZeneca Plc and Sanofi (SAN), which signed
confidentiality agreements on the drugmaker&#8217;s sale process, said
people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck  Co. (MRK), Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. (4502), Roche Holding AG (ROG)
and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) also signed agreements to get
access to confidential financial and product information for
Amylin, said the people, who declined to be identified as talks
are private. The drug developer is seeking a buyer following its
rejection of an unsolicited offer from Bristol-Myers, people
with knowledge of the matter said earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-round bids are due in the next two weeks, said two of
the people. Amylin, the maker of the diabetes drugs Bydureon and
Byetta, has a market capitalization of more than $4 billion and
generated more than $650 million in revenue last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Diabetes is an area companies either want a position in
or want a stronger position in,&#8221; said Mark Clark, an analyst at
Deutsche Bank in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amylin received regulatory approval for Bydureon, a once-weekly formulation of its earlier diabetes drug Byetta, in
January, and the therapy may draw $1.5 billion in peak annual
sales in the U.S., according to Robyn Karnauskas, an analyst
with Deutsche Bank. The drugmaker had been seeking a partner to
help market Bydureon outside the U.S. since November, when it
ended a collaboration with Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) said it is
in talks with three Japanese companies to jointly invest in
Chevron Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s Wheatstone natural gas project in Australia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electricity producer has held discussions with
Mitsubishi Corp. (8058), Nippon Yusen K.K. and state-owned Japan Oil,
Gas and Metals National Corp., Naoyuki Matsumoto, a spokesman
for the utility known as Tepco, said by telephone from Tokyo
today. He declined to give details of the proposed investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four companies are considering purchasing a $4.35
billion stake in the Wheatstone liquefied natural gas project,
two people with direct knowledge of the negotiations said,
asking not to be identified because the talks are private. The
group may buy a 10 percent stake in the gas fields and an 8
percent interest in the venture&#8217;s LNG facilities, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan to jointly invest in Wheatstone was first reported
by the Nikkei newspaper today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The A$29 billion ($29 billion) Wheatstone project is among
several Australian LNG projects aiming to meet rising Asian
demand led by Japan as the country ramps up thermal-power
generation after the Fukushima disaster shut all its nuclear
stations. Tepco, owner of the crippled Fukushima Dai-Ichi atomic
plant, invited the other Japanese companies to join it as it
deals with the costs of last year&#8217;s accident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a preliminary agreement signed in December 2009, Chevron
had said Tepco intends to acquire 15 percent of the second-largest U.S. oil company&#8217;s equity in the Wheatstone field and an
11.25 percent interest in the venture&#8217;s LNG processing
facilities to be developed onshore near Onslow in Western
Australia state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Negotiations Ongoing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tepco is still in negotiations with Chevron, spokesman
Matsumoto said, declining to elaborate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron doesn&#8217;t comment on speculation, the company&#8217;s
Australian unit said today in an e-mail statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Discussions with Wheatstone customers are ongoing,&#8221; it
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tepco and Mitsubishi may spend $70 million and $330 million
respectively to acquire 8 percent and 40 percent stakes in a
venture that will obtain the interest in the Australian gas
field, one person said. Nippon Yusen and state-owned Jogmec may
invest $90 million and $350 million, while the Japan Bank for
International Cooperation may buy preferred shares without
voting rights in the venture for $280 million, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JBIC may also lend about $2 billion to the venture, while
private banks may lend $1.3 billion, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are considering investing in the project&#8221; and a
decision has yet to be made, Kazuhiko Uematsu, a spokesman for
Jogmec, said by telephone today. &#8220;We can&#8217;t comment beyond that
because we are still in talks with private companies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitsubishi spokesman Shunsuke Nanami declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Billionaire George Soros&#8217;s investment
firm added to financial stocks in the first quarter, including
shares of JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Suntrust Banks Inc. (STI) He sold
the company&#8217;s stake in Google Inc. (GOOG) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $25 billion Soros Fund Management LLC, based in New
York, increased the value of its stake in financials by
7 percent, including 606,000 shares of JPMorgan worth $28
million as of March 31, and 3.2 million shares of Atlanta-based
Suntrust valued at $77 million, according to a filing yesterday
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of New York-based JPMorgan have fallen 11 percent
since the company disclosed a $2 billion trading loss on May 10.
The trades in synthetic credit derivatives led to the
resignation of senior managers and prompted Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon to say the investments were &#8220;flawed,
complex, poorly reviewed, poorly executed and poorly
monitored.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soros also purchased 3.75 million shares of Sugar Land,
Texas-based CVR Energy Inc. (CVI) valued at $100 million as of March
31. On May 7, billionaire Carl Icahn won the right to acquire
the oil refiner after a majority of CVR shareholders agreed to
sell their stakes to him for $30 a share. The shares have
climbed 62 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Google Sale &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm sold 260,000 shares of Mountain View, California-based Google, a stake that was valued at $168 million at the end
of the quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of the firm&#8217;s U.S. stock holdings rose to $5.75
billion from $4.18 billion at the end of 2011, according to the
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Vachon, a spokesman for Soros, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money managers who oversee more than $100 million in U.S.
equities must file a Form 13F within 45 days of the end of each
quarter to list their holdings in stocks that trade on U.S.
exchanges, as well as options and convertible debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds are lightly regulated pools of capital whose
managers can invest in any asset, and share in annual profits. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. has granted a visa to Cuban
President Raul Castro&#8217;s daughter to speak at a conference next
week in San Francisco, sparking angry protests from Cuban-
American lawmakers who said the action contradicts U.S. policy
toward the communist island. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mariela Castro Espin, 50, who heads Cuba&#8217;s government-
funded National Center for Sex Education, was granted permission
to attend next week&#8217;s meeting of the Latin American Studies
Association in California, said a U.S. official who spoke on
condition of anonymity to discuss a confidential visa matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Castro is the third Cuban official to receive permission
from the Obama administration to visit the U.S. &#8220;in flagrant
disregard of express Congressional intent and established U.S.
foreign policy,&#8221; according to a protest letter sent today to
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by Representative Ileana Ros- Lehtinen, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and
three other U.S. lawmakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An advocate for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender
issues, Castro will speak at a May 24 panel about sexual
diversity and politics, according to the conference program. She
is also scheduled to appear May 29 at the New York Public
Library to discuss Cuba&#8217;s policy of offering free sex
reassignment surgery under its universal health-care program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A niece of longtime Cuban leader Fidel Castro, who formally
ceded power to his younger brother four years ago, Castro hasn&#8217;t
been a critic of her father&#8217;s communist government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Florida Lawmakers Outraged &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three Florida Republicans -- Ros-Lehtinen and
Representatives Mario Diaz-Balart and David Rivera -- joined
Democratic Representative Albio Sires of New Jersey in
expressing &#8220;outrage&#8221; over the State Department&#8217;s decision to
provide entry visas to Castro and two other communist party
representatives, Josefina Vidal Ferreiro of the Cuban Ministry
of Foreign Affairs and Eusebio Leal, Havana&#8217;s chief historian
and an advocate for restoring the historical city center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter asserted that the decision to grant the visas
contradicts the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of
1996 and a presidential proclamation that prohibits non-
immigrant entry of Cuban government and communist party
officials, unless the Secretary of State or her representative
issues a waiver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who has been
mentioned as a possible running mate for presumed Republican
presidential nominee Mitt Romney, called the decision &#8220;an
enormous mistake.&#8221; Rubio called Castro&#8217;s daughter &#8220;an arm of
his regime, an outspoken supporter&#8221; who would &#8220;spread the
propaganda of her father&#8217;s regime.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Brutal Repression&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, called
Castro an &#8220;opponent of democracy who has defended the regime&#8217;s
brutal repression of democracy activists.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Neither the United States government nor the Latin
American Studies Association should be in the business of
providing a totalitarian regime, like the one in Cuba, with a
platform from which to espouse its twisted rhetoric,&#8221; he said
in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland today declined
to comment on the specific cases. She said there is &#8220;no blanket
restriction on the issuing of visas to Cuban citizens. In all
cases, visas are issued for legitimate travel purposes in the
United States, including coming for conferences.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Each visa request is reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
There is no blanket ban on issuing visas to Cuban government
officials,&#8221; the State Department said on May 15. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to put JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM)&#8217;s announced $2 billion trading loss into perspective, pick
up Michael Perino&#8217;s &#8220;The Hellhound of Wall Street.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vivid reconstruction of former New York City
prosecutor Ferdinand Pecora&#8217;s investigation into the crash of
1929 shows how a financial scandal often must reach a tipping
point before it triggers tighter legislation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Senate hearings held as banks across the U.S. were
shutting down in 1933, Pecora exposed stock-price manipulations,
hidden losses and other unsavory dealings. The testimony ignited
outrage against &#8220;banksters,&#8221; hastening laws including the
Glass-Steagall Act, which separated commercial and investment
banking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will JPMorgan&#8217;s bombshell give a similar impetus to the
Volcker rule, meant to prevent federally insured banks from
making bets for their own profit? That depends partly on the
size of the scandal, says Perino, a former Wall Street litigator
who teaches at St. John&#8217;s University School of Law in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A $2 billion trading loss is nothing to sneeze at, but it
pales in comparison to the banking crisis of 1933,&#8221; he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perino spoke with me by phone from his study in New Jersey.
Outside his window, wild green parrots were nesting around
electrical transformers, which keep them warm in winter, he
says. We discussed books on the Great Depression and what they
tell us about today&#8217;s economic slump, austerity fatigue and
battles over banking rules. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects name of investor in final paragraph.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotify Ltd., the London-based music-
streaming service, is recruiting Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) as it
seeks funding that would value the company as high as $4
billion, according to people with knowledge of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, co-founded by Chief Executive Officer Daniel Ek in 2006, is raising $100 million to $200 million, said two of
the people, who weren&#8217;t authorized to speak publicly. Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. may invest, said a third person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotify is seeking money as it expands into new markets, Ek
told Swedish newspaper Dagens Industri in an April 13 story.
Each territory requires costly content licensing agreements, he
said. Spotify operates in 13 countries, with 10 million users
and 3 million paying subscribers, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Wells, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman Sachs,
declined to comment. Graham James, a spokesman for Spotify in
New York, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Times reported today that Goldman is set to
participate, accounting for about $100 million. The Financial
Times reported Spotify&#8217;s funding plans in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotify most recently expanded into Germany on April 13,
offering its free, advertising-supported service, as well as
paid subscription plans. The company also offers service in the
U.S., U.K., Sweden, Finland, Norway, Denmark, France,
Switzerland, Austria, Belgium, The Netherlands and Spain,
according to the website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Artist Resistance &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The service is trying to add more artists. Adele, the Black
Keys, Coldplay and Tom Waits have withheld new releases from
Spotify, which began U.S. service in July. In April, the company
announced exclusive access to songs and albums by the Red Hot
Chili Peppers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotify faces competition from other subscription music
services, including Rdio Inc., as well as online ventures by
Viacom Inc. (VIAB)&#8217;s MTV, AOL Inc. (AOL) and Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company lost about $91 million over the past two years,
Dagens Industri reported. Ek said in the interview that revenue
this year may exceed 6 billion kronor ($833 million). The
service paid about $150 million to rights holders in 2011,
compared with $55 million in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotify raised $100 million last year from venture capital
investors including DST Global, Accel Partners and Kleiner
Perkins Caufield  Byers, achieving a valuation of about $1
billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and funds
managed by the firm raised $1.09 billion selling stock in
Facebook Inc. (FB)&#8217;s initial public offering, cashing out almost half
their stake in the social network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment bank and its funds offered 28.7 million of
the 65.9 million shares they own at $38 apiece, the top of the
price range. Goldman Sachs sold 6.18 million of its own
holdings, raising $235 million. The number of shares being
offered by Goldman Sachs was included in a filing yesterday by
Menlo Park, California-based Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment gain helps validate Goldman Sachs Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein&#8217;s business model and a
January 2011 transaction that threatened to undermine efforts to
improve his New York-based company&#8217;s reputation after it settled
fraud claims a year earlier. U.S. regulators are drafting rules
to prevent banks that receive federal backing from making risky
bets with their own money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What risks should government-insured banks be taking?
What if, hypothetically, Facebook had imploded?&#8221; asked Benjamin B. Wallace, an analyst at Westborough, Massachusetts-based
Grimes  Co., which manages about $1 billion and doesn&#8217;t hold
Goldman Sachs shares. &#8220;This is what happens when it works
out.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and its funds could sell 4.3 million more
shares -- bringing the total raised to as much as $1.25 billion
at the $38 price -- if the IPO&#8217;s underwriters decide there&#8217;s
enough demand, according to Facebook&#8217;s filing. If that so-called
greenshoe option is exercised, the investment bank and its funds
will have cut their holdings 50 percent. Underwriters include
Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Group Effort &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs created a special-purpose vehicle to bundle
the holdings under one name and sell the stock to wealthy
clients. That kept it from running afoul of securities rules
mandating that companies with at least 500 investors meet U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission reporting requirements. Jon Stewart, discussing the deal on Comedy Central&#8217;s &#8220;The Daily
Show,&#8221; joked at the time, &#8220;Oh Goldman, is there any
regulation&#8217;s intent you can&#8217;t subvert?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A document for investors disclosed that Goldman Sachs might
sell or hedge its stake without warning clients, underscoring
potential conflicts in the firm&#8217;s business model of investing
its own money as well as advising customers. The bank eventually
said it canceled an offering of Facebook shares to U.S.
investors amid concern that &#8220;intense media attention&#8221; may
violate rules limiting marketing of private securities. Only
offshore clients could participate in the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Balancing Act &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investing for clients, that&#8217;s certainly something they
should be doing,&#8221; Wallace said about Goldman Sachs. &#8220;If,
instead of investing proprietary money you pool investor money
and manage that, there&#8217;s still an opportunity&#8221; for Goldman
Sachs, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IPO, the largest by a technology company, values
Facebook at more than $104 billion. That&#8217;s more than double the
$50 billion value at which Goldman Sachs offered $1 billion of
stock to non-U.S. clients in January 2011. The firm and the
Goldman Sachs Investment Partners hedge fund run by Raanan A. Agus bought $450 million of Facebook stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Bloomberg poll in late January 2011 found that 69 percent
of global investors, traders and analysts surveyed thought the
$50 billion valuation was too high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Goldman Gets &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets, sold
6.18 million of the 14.2 million shares it owns for its own
account, according to Facebook&#8217;s filing. The sale price values
the firm&#8217;s total investment at $540 million, of which Goldman
Sachs is cashing in $235 million in the IPO. If the greenshoe is
exercised at $38, Goldman Sachs will raise an additional $35
million. That would cut the size of its holding to 7.1 million
shares, valued at $270 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gain on Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Facebook stake will be
recognized in second-quarter results, helping to mitigate
&#8220;weakness in investment banking and trading revenue,&#8221; Edward Najarian, an analyst at International Strategy  Investment
Group Inc., wrote in a research note this week. He cut his
second-quarter earnings per share estimate for Goldman Sachs to
$2 from $2.60. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GSIP, the fund run by Agus, sold 1.57 million of the 3.61
million Facebook shares it holds in two investment pools,
according to the filing. The IPO helped GSIP raise $59.6 million
and a greenshoe at the same price would add $8.9 million,
leaving GSIP with 1.8 million shares valued at $69 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s non-U.S. clients, whose Facebook shares are
held in a Cayman Islands-based investment pool called FBDC
Investors Offshore Holdings LP, sold 20.9 million shares for
$795 million. A greenshoe at the same price would raise another
$119 million and leave the investor pool with 24.1 million
shares worth $914 million at $38 a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to
comment on the share sales. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s $2 billion
trading loss has prompted the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
to examine how banks in its district are managing cash after
receiving a flood of deposits since the credit crisis, according
to a person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based JPMorgan&#8217;s trading loss, announced last
week, occurred in its chief investment office, which oversees
about $360 billion, the difference between deposits and what the
bank lends. The New York Fed is reviewing the structure of
investment units and similar businesses at other banks it
regulates, said the person, who wasn&#8217;t authorized to discuss the
matter publicly and declined to be identified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are struggling to manage an influx of deposits as
investors take advantage of a bigger federal guarantee and the
perceived safety of the largest banks. In 2008, President George W. Bush signed a bill that temporarily increased deposit-insurance coverage to $250,000 per depositor from $100,000. The
Dodd-Frank Act overhauling financial regulation, which President
Barack Obama signed in 2010, made the increase permanent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s not enough loan volume to drive earnings-per-share and to successfully reinvest all the liquidity,&#8221; said
David Hendler, senior analyst at research firm CreditSights Inc.
in New York. &#8220;So, in a way, it forced them to do this, and the
trade got away from them,&#8221; he said, referring to JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bank Portfolios &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total deposits at institutions insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. rose to about $10.2 trillion at the end
of last year from $8.2 trillion in the third quarter of 2007. In
the same period, total loans fell to $7.5 trillion from $7.7
trillion. Securities in bank portfolios rose to $2.9 trillion
from $2 trillion, according to FDIC data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, there are &#8220;other ways to deal with&#8221; the gap
between loans and deposits, &#8220;and you don&#8217;t have to just take it
in,&#8221; Hendler said. &#8220;You could create an opportunity cost for
the depositor to go to some other bank.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of New York Mellon Corp. last year said it would
charge institutional clients a fee for unusually high deposits
as a flight to safety pushed money-market rates below zero and
left the custody bank flooded with client cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York Fed spokeswoman Andrea Priest declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said on a
conference call with analysts on May 10 after announcing the
loss that all banks have &#8220;these fairly large portfolios&#8221; that
invest excess cash. Dimon had encouraged the unit to boost
earnings by buying higher-yielding assets, including structured
credit, equities and derivatives, ex-employees said in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;100 Years&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I should point out to all the folks on the phone, you
could see -- you can go to the 10-Q and see what people have in
those portfolios,&#8221; Dimon said on the call, referring to
quarterly report filings. &#8220;And some banks do some things, and
some do others. But to invest those excess deposits, you buy
securities. That&#8217;s been going on for 100 years in banking.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott Siefers, a managing director at Sandler O&#8217;Neill
Partners, a New York investment bank and brokerage firm that
specializes in financial companies, said treasury management is
usually a &#8220;mundane task&#8221; inside most banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors and regulators don&#8217;t like to see banks using a
securities portfolio as a major earnings driver,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;There is a knee-jerk reaction that says the bank might be
taking on some undue risk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Under Pressure &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, banks are also under pressure to keep net interest
margins high, Siefers said. Treasury managers are feeling the
pressure to boost risk and earn returns because loan growth is
tepid. At the same time, they are trying to avoid getting caught
if interest rates head higher sometime in the next few years, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo has overhauled the
Fed&#8217;s supervisory approach from a bank-focused examination
process to a broader systemic view that compares practices at
several institutions at once. The main forum for such reviews is
the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee, or
LISCC, which includes top supervisors from the Fed&#8217;s regional
banks and also economists, financial-markets experts and
computer modelers from the Fed Board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have supplemented the traditional, firm-by-firm
approach to supervision with a routine use of horizontal, or
cross-firm, reviews to monitor industry practices, common
trading and funding strategies, balance-sheet developments,
interconnectedness, and other factors with implications for
systemic risk,&#8221; Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said in a speech
last month in Stone Mountain, Georgia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Capital Buffers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve Board spokeswoman Barbara Hagenbaugh
declined to comment. She said earlier this week that the central
bank, as JPMorgan&#8217;s holding-company supervisor, is studying
organizational issues around the trading loss to ensure that
they aren&#8217;t repeated in other areas of the bank. The loss
underscores the importance of capital buffers, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Office of Comptroller of the Currency said this week it
is examining JPMorgan&#8217;s activities and its transactions
following the $2 billion loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our examiners are also evaluating risk management
strategies and practices in place at other large banks to
validate our understanding of inherent risk levels and controls
of these risks,&#8221; said OCC spokesman Bryan Hubbard. The OCC
oversees national banks, including JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon announced his bank&#8217;s &#8220;egregious&#8221; trading loss on
May 10, two months after the biggest U.S. bank by assets passed
a Fed stress test that put its loans and securities through a
scenario of deep recession and a simulated global financial
market shock. The bank&#8217;s flawed positions on synthetic credit
holdings could result in an additional $1 billion loss or more
as they&#8217;re wound down, Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Pfizer (PFE) Inc. drug that has
transformed treatment for adult lung cancers caused by a gene
defect is now saving children with deadly tumors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s Xalkori eradicated signs of malignancy in some
kids with rare tumors of the nerves, blood and soft tissue,
according to findings released yesterday in advance of the
American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting that starts June
1. The three tumor types can be driven by ALK gene mutations
targeted by Xalkori. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results show how medicines that target genetic flaws
can be first tested in one cancer and then rapidly applied to
other malignancies with the same gene abnormality. The drug
helped kids with all three tumors, with the most-impressive
results seen in a blood cancer called anaplastic large cell
lymphoma. In these cases, all signs of cancer vanished in seven
of eight kids who got the drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a glimpse of the new paradigm&#8221; of cancer drug
development, said Michael Link, a Stanford University pediatric
cancer specialist and president of the American Society of
Clinical Oncology, on a conference call with reporters. By
understanding the molecular drivers of the tumors, &#8220;we have the
prospect of seeing dramatic responses.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By identifying the genetic drivers of pediatric tumors,
scientists may be able to take targeted drugs already approved
for adults and apply them to children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview, Link called the initial results &#8220;really
extraordinary.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer fell less than 1 percent to $22.56 at the close of
New York trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nerve and Tissue Cancers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pfizer drug also eliminated measurable signs of cancer
in 2 of 27 kids with neuroblastoma, a rare nerve cell cancer,
who had failed standard therapy. The drug also shrank tumors in
2 of 7 children with inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, a rare
malignancy of soft tissues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial was sponsored by the government-funded Children&#8217;s
Oncology Group, a consortium of experts, children&#8217;s hospitals,
cancer centers and universities, and also received support from
New York-based Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is far too soon to tell if any of the children are
cured, &#8220;these are very promising results for kids who
historically have had very few options and no hope,&#8221; Yael
Mosse, a pediatric oncologist at the Children&#8217;s Hospital of
Philadelphia and the study&#8217;s lead researcher, said in an
interview. &#8220;They have their whole lives ahead of them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 120 kids in the U.S. each year develop ALK-positive
lymphoma, while 100 get neuroblastoma that contains defects in
the ALK gene, Mosse said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Advanced Testing Planned &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mosse said the researchers plan to begin a final-stage
trial of the Pfizer drug in kids with lymphoma by the end of the
year. The goal is to use the Pfizer drug for all children newly
diagnosed with this type of lymphoma and replace some of the
toxic chemotherapy that is used today, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is &#8220;a major opportunity&#8221; to lessen the intensity of
chemotherapy so that cure comes at less of a cost, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zach Witt is one child who was helped by the drug, said his
mother Pam Witt, who lives in outer suburbs of Philadelphia, in
a phone interview. The 6-year-old developed lymphoma in
September 2010 and relapsed in the middle of his chemotherapy
treatment in early April of 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He soon developed high fevers and became so weak that he
couldn&#8217;t make it to the hospital playroom just down the hall
from his room, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors at the Children&#8217;s Hospital of Philadelphia gave her
and her husband a choice of putting Zach on a more toxic chemo
regimen or going into the trial of Xalkori. They chose the
Xalkori. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Being a Kid Again &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the third day on the drug, Zach was running to the
hospital playroom, she said. Today he is out of the hospital,
and &#8220;does everything any other kid would do,&#8221; she said. He is
so energetic he recently went on a 21-mile bike ride with his
father, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think Zach would be here&#8221; without the Pfizer
drug, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Child and adult cancer drug testing &#8220;used to operate in
separate universes,&#8221; said Rob Sweetman, a senior director at
Pfizer&#8217;s cancer unit. &#8220;Now we understand these molecular
drivers that are connecting these two that weren&#8217;t as obvious
before.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweetman said Pfizer is carefully monitoring the progress
of the child trials and will make a determination whether to
seek regulatory approval for the child uses when more data is
available. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s
chief executive officer, agreed to testify before a Senate
committee on the company&#8217;s $2 billion loss as lawmakers debate
whether to tighten rules on trading by U.S. lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon was asked to appear after the Senate Banking
Committee concludes hearings on industry reforms in June,
according to a statement from Chairman Tim Johnson, a South
Dakota Democrat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As always, we will continue to be open and transparent
with our regulators and Congress,&#8221; said Jennifer Zuccarelli, a
spokeswoman for JPMorgan, who confirmed Dimon&#8217;s plan to testify.
The New York-based lender is the largest in the U.S. by assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and regulators face pressure to explain the loss
as lawmakers haggle over rules for the Dodd-Frank regulatory
overhaul enacted two years ago. Dimon, 56, announced the loss
May 10, assailing his firm&#8217;s handling of trading in synthetic
credit positions as &#8220;flawed, complex, poorly reviewed, poorly
executed and poorly monitored.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the company and regulators have briefed the committee
over the past week, &#8220;our due diligence has made it clear that
the Banking Committee should hear directly from JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s
CEO Jamie Dimon,&#8221; Johnson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson&#8217;s decision to invite Dimon came after joint staff
briefings with federal regulators and a separate briefing from
JPMorgan, the lawmaker said in a statement. The invitation comes
as Congress increases scrutiny, with at least one Republican
senator calling for Dimon to claw back pay from employees
responsible for the losses and Senate Democrats using the
disclosure to bolster their case for tighter restrictions on
proprietary trading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) Chairman Win Bischoff said the $2 billion trading loss suffered by JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) could happen to any bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If it can happen to JPMorgan, which has such a good risk
culture, then it could happen anywhere,&#8221; Bischoff said today on
the sidelines of the bank&#8217;s annual general meeting in Edinburgh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan reported the loss related to derivatives trading
last week after an &#8220;egregious&#8221; failure in a unit managing
risks. Bischoff said Lloyds had investigated its own operations
and was satisfied with the safeguards at the lender. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have looked at all the things we are doing that might
have linkages to some of those financing structures,&#8221; Bischoff
said. &#8220;We simply haven&#8217;t found anything.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Antonio Horta-Osorio, 48, is
seeking to strengthen London-based Lloyds&#8217;s balance sheet by
selling assets, cutting costs and bolstering its capital
strength. Lloyds, which cut more than 30,000 jobs since its 20
billion-pound ($31.7 billion) taxpayer rescue in 2008, said this
month it will shrink assets further and faster than forecast as
Britain&#8217;s biggest mortgage lender reduces its reliance on short-
term funding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are mostly a retail and commercial bank and therefore
the value that we have at risk and our limits are completely
different from investment banking operations&#8221; such as JPMorgan,
Horta-Osorio told journalists today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lloyds cut its reliance on wholesale funding by 24 percent
to 231.3 billion pounds in the first quarter. Funding with a
maturity of less than one year fell by 41 percent to 91.4
billion pounds. The bank boosted its core Tier 1 ratio, a
measure of financial strength, to 11 percent in the quarter,
from 10 percent a year earlier. That exceeds the 9.5 percent
target required by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
for lenders such as Lloyds, which are deemed too big to fail. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission held at least two special meetings in the past week
to review the circumstances surrounding JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s
$2 billion loss, according to people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC held a closed meeting on Saturday, May 12, and
another three days later to discuss &#8220;an examination of a
financial institution,&#8221; according to a news release e-mailed
May 15. The agency&#8217;s five commissioners held the meetings to
find out what staff knew about the losses and to discuss how the
agency should respond, said two people who declined to be
identified because the discussions weren&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said May 10
that the bank made &#8220;egregious&#8221; mistakes and that the losses of
about $2 billion tied to synthetic credit securities were
&#8220;self-inflicted.&#8221; The announcement has spurred reviews by
several financial regulators, including the SEC, Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency and criminal authorities in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The losses, which could increase by $1 billion or more,
originated out of a London unit of JPMorgan&#8217;s Chief Investment
Office, which is generally responsible for managing the bank&#8217;s
interest rate, foreign currency and other economic risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At times, changes in commission priorities require
alterations in the scheduling of meeting items,&#8221; the SEC said
in the release. SEC spokesman John Nester declined to comment
about the meetings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604), Japan&#8217;s largest
brokerage, hired Tony Hayden and Jason Osier as managing
directors in the Americas equities division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hayden will oversee the Tokyo-based firm&#8217;s delta one
business in the region, and Osier will lead its single stock
derivatives trading team, Nomura said in a statement today.
Hayden was most recently head of delta one trading for North
America at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), and Osier was a managing
director at Plural Investments LLC, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will both report to Jonathan Larkin, head of trading
for equities Americas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nomura has expanded from 900 U.S. employees in March 2009
to 2,350 this year. The Americas contributed 43.4 billion yen
($541 million), or 27 percent, to Nomura&#8217;s fiscal fourth-quarter
global wholesale revenue, which consists of investment banking,
fixed-income and equities trading. The quarter was the Americas
wholesale division&#8217;s strongest since Nomura began building its
U.S. operation in April 2009, the firm said earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) lawyer
from Sullivan  Cromwell LLP may testify at next week&#8217;s insider-trading trial of Rajat Gupta, a former director at the bank, a
prosecutor said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a pretrial conference yesterday in Manhattan federal
court, Assistant U.S. Attorney Reed Brodsky said prosecutors
expect to present testimony from Steven Peikin, a lawyer at
Sullivan  Cromwell who advises New York-based Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peikin&#8217;s testimony &#8220;will relate to certain statements made
by Mr. Gupta in an interview,&#8221; Brodsky told U.S. District Judge
Jed Rakoff, without providing other details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brodsky&#8217;s comments came at the close of a hearing in which
Rakoff said he&#8217;s likely to allow prosecutors to introduce as
evidence four wiretaps from 2008 that are critical to the
government&#8217;s case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one, Gupta is heard discussing Goldman Sachs business
with Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam, who is now
serving an 11-year prison term for insider trading. In three
others, Gupta isn&#8217;t a participant as Rajaratnam discusses stock
trades with his employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors say Rajaratnam made the trades based on Gupta&#8217;s
leaks. Rakoff said the three wiretaps may show Rajaratnam, as
one member of an insider-trading conspiracy, referring to tips
he got from Gupta, who prosecutors say is another member of the
scheme. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artist Tom Sachs rocketed to fame in
the 1990s with sardonic works such as &#8220;Hermes Hand Grenade,&#8221;
&#8220;Chanel Guillotine&#8221; and &#8220;Prada Death Camp.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, he launched his sculptural space odyssey at the
Gagosian gallery in Beverly Hills with a trip to the moon,
complete with sample rocks chiseled from the floor of the
gallery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now &#8220;Space Program&#8221; -- a deadpan trip to Mars -- has
landed in the 55,000-square-foot Drill Hall of Manhattan&#8217;s Park
Avenue Armory. It&#8217;s a huge installation of sculptures hand-crafted from plywood, foam-core, glue and steel. There&#8217;s a
mission control, a spacecraft, a launch platform, a roving
vehicle and a Darth Vader beer dispenser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spoke at a steel desk in front of the video wall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lundborg: You&#8217;ve been working on this for three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sachs: This iteration for three years. We&#8217;ve actually been
working on it since 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lundborg: So are you facing post-Mars depression? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sachs: We&#8217;re going straight into Europa. It&#8217;s an icy moon
of Jupiter that has a 4-kilometer ice crust and within it is a
liquid core. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we know of earth science, where there is liquid water,
there is life. So the scientists in the astrobiology field are
looking at Europa as the best chance in our solar system for
life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Odyssey &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lundborg: How did the Tom Sachs space odyssey start? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sachs: I&#8217;ve been interested in these space themes for many,
many years, but I really see it as a scaffold for other issues.
To me, the main issue is transparency in construction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We paint the plywood before we cut it, you see the screws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lundborg: Unlike my highly designed iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sachs: There is no evidence of its construction -- it&#8217;s a
miraculous object and it really sums up where we are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this installation represents where we&#8217;ve been, and
shows a transparency of construction and a transparency of use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it is, we&#8217;re destroying our planet. The more you use
your iPhone, it only gets worse and weaker, while plywood,
leather and other organic materials tend to improve with age. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lundborg: Isn&#8217;t it delusional to think we&#8217;re going to find
a nice new planet to mess up? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sachs: The science of exploring other worlds is useful on
Earth: solar power, water and fuel conservation, food, waste
management -- all the basic stuff we&#8217;re struggling with is
exploited better in the space program than anywhere else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Phony Green &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lundborg: Looking at the installation, my first thought
wasn&#8217;t &#8220;green.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sachs: &#8220;Green&#8221; is kind of a phony buzz word, and people
talk about recycling. The real word you want is &#8220;re-use.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason people are using &#8220;green&#8221; is to sell more
stuff, like beautiful, stainless-steel water bottles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lundborg: Many of the artifacts in the D.C. Air and Space
Museum look a lot like your handmade sculptures, so in a way
it&#8217;s amazing to consider they could make it into outer space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sachs: The Russian space program is even more bricolage,
more cobbled together than ours. The Americans spent over $1
million to test the Fisher space pen. It writes in zero gravity,
upside down and under water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Russians weren&#8217;t as well-funded as the Americans so
they used pencil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lundborg: You developed strong relationships with NASA
scientists. What did you learn from them? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sachs: From an engineering standpoint, the concept of baby
fat. You have to design in a little bit of flexibility. Things
can&#8217;t be so rigid, because you have to allow for your mistakes
further on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lundborg: I&#8217;m assuming you&#8217;re a sci-fi fan? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sachs: Of course. The thing that was always interesting
about &#8220;Star Trek&#8221; was that it was about life on Earth. Our
space program is also about life here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you colonize another planet -- or country -- you bring
your bacteria to them and screw up their ecosystem, and you
bring their bacteria or their gold back with you. If you don&#8217;t
agree with their ethics, maybe you bring a Bible and a shotgun
and make them see it your way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cocktails on Mars &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lundborg: I notice you&#8217;re taking opium and bourbon to Mars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sachs: One of the big parts of our space program is ritual.
Our main ritual is work, but cocktails, coffee and cigarettes
are ways people have of connecting to each other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ritual, drugs, community -- these are real things that are
part of who we are in our society. For us opium is interesting
since it represents man&#8217;s hedonistic nadir. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#8217;re also bringing the Japanese tea ceremony to Mars,
which I believe represents man&#8217;s greatest achievement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Space Program: Mars&#8221; runs through June 17 at the Park
Avenue Armory, 643 Park Ave. Information: +1-212-616-3930;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) won a federal trade
ruling that will force Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. (MMI) to alter
software on some of its Android-based mobile phones to keep
bringing them into the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A U.S. International Trade Commission judge found that
Motorola Mobility infringed a patent covering a program by
Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft called ActiveSync, which
lets users generate meeting requests among a group. Six other
patents weren&#8217;t violated, the judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling still must be reviewed by President Barack Obama, who can override the order on public policy grounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We hope that now Motorola will be willing to join the
vast majority of Android device makers selling phones in the
U.S. by taking a license to our patents,&#8221; David Howard,
Microsoft&#8217;s deputy general counsel, said in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An exclusion order would affect Droid 2, Droid X, i1, Cliq
XT, Devour, Backflip, Charm and Clip models, according to a
filing with the ITC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Android Fight &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility said it was disappointed and would
explore options including an appeal. &#8220;Motorola Mobility will
not experience any impact in the near term,&#8221; Jennifer Erickson,
a company spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling probably will push Motorola to reach a
settlement and pay Microsoft a licensing fee instead of having
to modify the phone software, said Charlie Wolf, an analyst with
Needham  Co in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These cases usually end up with the parties settling,&#8221;
Wolf said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is part of a broader effort by Microsoft and Apple
Inc. to curtail the growth of mobile devices that run on Google
Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Android operating system. Google licenses Android for
free to further its mobile-advertising business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The platform has become the most popular for smartphones,
with more than half of a market for mobile devices that Yankee
Group has projected will reach $360 billion this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Licensing Deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft contends it should be paid royalties by makers of
mobile devices that run on Android. The software maker has
reached licensing deals with Samsung Electronics Co. and HTC
Corp. (2498) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility, which is being bought by Google, refused
to pay and instead struck back in a case at the trade agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s willingness to license is different from Apple,
which wants makers of Android smartphones to make changes to its
devices, Wolf said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would expect Motorola to get together with Microsoft to
resolve this,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Xbox, Windows &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has capitalized on patents it said cover features
of Android, and said it has struck licensing agreements with
makers of more than 70 percent of all Android devices sold in
the U.S. Microsoft&#8217;s only litigation with Android-device makers
is with Motorola Mobility, following a settlement reached last
month with Barnes  Noble Inc. (BKS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software maker filed the ITC complaint in October 2010.
Motorola Mobility responded by sending letters demanding
royalties on Microsoft products, including the Xbox and Windows
operating system. The legal battle has since escalated, with
Microsoft accusing Motorola Mobility of misusing its patents in
a lawsuit pending in Seattle and before regulators in the U.S.
and Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility has filed its own patent-infringement
claim against Microsoft at the agency, seeking to block sales of
the Xbox. An ITC judge said Microsoft was infringing four
Motorola Mobility patents; Microsoft wants the commission to
review that decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s case against Motorola Mobility is In the Matter
of Certain Mobile Devices, Associated Software and Components
Thereof, 337-744, while Motorola Mobility&#8217;s case against
Microsoft is In the matter of Gaming and Entertainment Consoles,
337-752, both U.S. International Trade Commission (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) recalled 650,000 units of
Advil Liqui-Gels in March because of an odor caused by over-processed gelatin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pills were recalled from stores by distributors in a
March 16 letter sent by New York-based Pfizer, according to the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#8217;s website. The gelatin is an
inactive ingredient in the medicine, and over processing made
the pills smell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It had a strong odor,&#8221; Jenifer Antonacci, a Pfizer
spokeswoman, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;As soon as we
found out about it, we isolated the issue and corrected it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, isn&#8217;t the only one
to experience quality issues with consumer pain relief products.
On Feb. 17, Johnson  Johnson, based in New Brunswick, New
Jersey, said it was pulling over a half-million bottles of
infants&#8217; Tylenol from shelves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer gained less than 1 percent to $22.57 at the close of
New York trading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Republicans in the U.S. Congress were
uniting behind a call to repeal all or part of the 2010
financial regulatory overhaul. Since JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
announced its $2 billion trading loss earlier this month, that
front has splintered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some are seeking investigations, with Senator Mike Crapo of
Idaho among those calling on JPMorgan Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon to testify, which he has agreed to
do. Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, the Banking Committee&#8217;s
top Republican, said the loss emphasizes the need for capital
standards for banks tougher than what the overhaul requires.
Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee says Congress has no
business getting involved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The divisions point to a party torn by instincts to fix
problems as significant as the losses suffered by one of the
nation&#8217;s biggest banks, by a Tea Party-backed faction that seeks
to avoid any prospect of future bailouts, and by presumptive
Republican nominee Mitt Romney&#8217;s stance that one bank&#8217;s loss was
another investor&#8217;s gain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We need to get over the idea that every time a bank fails
or has a problem that Washington&#8217;s job is to bail it out or fix
it,&#8221; Alexander said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Suspicious of Banks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congressional Republicans may not be able to resolve their
differences on this issue, said Michael Franc, vice president of
government relations at the Heritage Foundation, a Washington-based research group that favors small government. While most
Republican lawmakers oppose strict regulation, more are becoming
as suspicious of big banks as they are of big government, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;One of the dynamics that&#8217;s emerged in the Republican
Party over the last decade or so is a growing populist feel,&#8221;
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Republican lawmakers split over their response to the
JPMorgan loss, Democrats are unified on their message: that the
trading loss underscores the need for tougher regulation of
banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s one of those things that&#8217;s clear that they were
betting like you would do at the craps table in Las Vegas and
they bet the wrong way,&#8221; Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a
Nevada Democrat, said of the company&#8217;s loss this week. &#8220;That&#8217;s
fine if they did it with their own money, but the problem is,
the way Wall Street&#8217;s been working, is that heads they win,
tails we lose.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;JPMorgan Loophole&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senators Carl Levin of Michigan and Jeff Merkley of Oregon,
the two Democrats who drafted the ban on proprietary trading
included in the Dodd-Frank Act, are increasing pressure on
regulators to tighten the so-called Volcker rule, which they say
has a &#8220;JPMorgan loophole.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Last fall&#8217;s proposed rule ignored the clear legislative
language and clear statement of congressional intent and allowed
for so-called &#8216;portfolio hedging,&#8217;&#8221; the lawmakers wrote in a
letter yesterday to the five federal regulators drafting the
rule. &#8220;Now, in recent days, we&#8217;ve seen exactly what &#8216;portfolio
hedging&#8217; might mean.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, who disclosed the loss May 10, told shareholders
there was no justification for the &#8220;egregious mistakes&#8221; by the
biggest and most profitable U.S. bank. In two lawsuits filed
this week in Manhattan federal court, shareholders sued the bank
and Dimon over the loss. He agreed yesterday to testify before
the Senate Banking Committee as it concludes hearings on
regulatory changes in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Way America Works&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Days after the bank&#8217;s loss was disclosed, Romney weighed
in. The former Massachusetts governor said business losses are
part of &#8220;the way America works&#8221; and urged caution in adopting
new rules in response. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would not rush to pass new legislation or new
regulation,&#8221; Romney said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The matter puts Republicans in the position of deciding
whether to take action that will affect an industry that is a
top donor to the party. Congressional Republicans are
campaigning, with the election less than six months away, to
keep control of the House and win a majority in the Senate now
governed by Democrats, 53-47. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campaign contributions from the banking industry were
almost evenly split in the 2008 presidential election year, when
Republicans reaped 54 percent of industry donations, according
to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington
group that tracks the influence of money on politics. That
improved for Republicans in 2010 as they sought to win control
of the U.S. House. In the 2010 election cycle, commercial banks
donated $9 million to federal candidates, 61 percent of which
went to Republicans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PAC Contributions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s political action committees donated $829,000 to
candidates, parties and political action committees between Jan.
1, 2011, and March 31, 2012, up from $459,000 in that period two
years earlier, Federal Election Commission records show.
Republican candidates have received 57 percent of the company&#8217;s
donations in this election cycle, compared with 43 percent for
Democrats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the announcement of the loss, Republican lawmakers
have moved in different directions, with most calling for a
closer examination of what happened before tightening rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You have to get all the facts on the table,&#8221; said
Senator Johnny Isakson, a Georgia Republican. &#8220;We&#8217;ve passed a
plethora of laws and regulations. I think we let it settle out
before we overreact.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representative Tom Cole, an Oklahoma Republican, said he
favors hearings &#8220;to make sure there is not a culture and
attitude that is threatening the stability of the entire
system.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tougher Capital Standards &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a few congressional Republicans, including
Shelby, are making the case that tougher capital standards are
needed beyond what is in the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would certainly be in favor of starting to raise
capital requirements to make sure banks are secure,&#8221; said
Senator Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican. &#8220;Then the taxpayer
won&#8217;t have to back it up.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that doesn&#8217;t mean the government should break up
big banks. &#8220;If the markets determine that&#8217;s the best way to go,
that&#8217;s fine,&#8221; Johnson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others are urging the government not to get involved,
particularly because JPMorgan&#8217;s solvency isn&#8217;t in question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nobody has said that what happened created any kind of a
risk that bank couldn&#8217;t handle,&#8221; said Senator Saxby Chambliss,
a Georgia Republican, who said regulators can handle the matter
with the tools they have. &#8220;The CEO had to respond to
shareholders. There was no tax money at risk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Brown&#8217;s Letter &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Republican seeking re-election this fall has struck out
on his own path. Senator Scott Brown, a Massachusetts
Republican, sent a letter to Dimon this week, telling him he
should &#8220;impose financial penalties&#8221; on employees responsible
for the trading loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It has been very frustrating to watch the continuing
volatility in our financial markets, and this $2 billion loss,
while painful, provides a good opportunity for JPMorgan to prove
that compensation practices have truly changed since the 2008
financial crisis,&#8221; Brown wrote to Dimon in a letter dated
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown, one of three Senate Republicans who voted in favor
of the 2010 financial regulatory law, is seeking re-election in
a close race against the presumed Democratic nominee, Elizabeth Warren, who advised President Barack Obama in setting up the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8217;Big Financial Scandal&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The differing responses among Republicans suggests that
there may not be enough votes in Congress to make any big
changes to the regulatory overhaul. Jaret Seiberg, a senior
policy analyst at Guggenheim Securities&#8217; Washington Research
Group, said it may take one more &#8220;big financial scandal&#8221; to
galvanize Republicans around the notion of breaking up big
banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When push comes to shove, the risk here is that you give
momentum to the break-up-the-bank faction,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cole said Republicans were slow to discuss the JPMorgan
trading losses because &#8220;we&#8217;re obviously not for Dodd-Frank;
most of us voted against it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, he said, &#8220;people in both parties have been cautious
about commenting, in part, nobody knows if there is another shoe
to drop out there. It caught people by surprise.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investment banking revenue may fall
24 percent in the second quarter as the effect of the European
Central Bank&#8217;s 1 trillion-euro ($1.3 trillion) of loans to the
banking system wears off, JPMorgan (JPM) Chase  Co. analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from fixed-income, currencies and commodities
trading may fall 32 percent while income from equities may drop
14 percent from the first quarter, analysts including London-based Kian Abouhossein said in a report to clients today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ECB in December and February offered banks unlimited
three-year loans after funding markets froze and yields on
southern European government debt hit euro-era records. The move
helped to reduce yields on both bank and government bonds. The
&#8220;positive momentum&#8221; generated by the Long Term Refinancing
Operation slowed in April, Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) Chief Financial
Officer Stefan Krause said April 26. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Without LTRO liquidity and credit spreads widening again,
we expect overall investment banking revenues are in an
accelerated seasonal quarter-two/quarter-one decline due to
material client flow activity slowdown,&#8221; the JPMorgan analysts
said. The &#8220;deteriorating macro newsflow is leading to increased
risk aversion,&#8221; leading to a decline in fixed income,
currencies and commodities income, they said.      Greece will
go the polls on June 17 after an election on May 6 failed to
produce a government. The country&#8217;s credit rating was reduced
one level by Fitch Ratings yesterday amid concern it won&#8217;t
muster the political support needed to remain a member of the
17-nation euro area. Almost $4 trillion has been wiped from
global equity markets this month amid mounting concern the
country will have to leave the euro. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s loss from
derivatives trading may widen to $5 billion, the Wall Street
Journal reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon personally approved the
strategy that led to the trades, without monitoring how they
were executed, the newspaper said, citing people familiar with
the matter that it didn&#8217;t identify. His failure to closely
regulate that activity caused resentment among executives whose
departments face tighter oversight, according to the Journal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan last week announced a $2 billion trading loss on
synthetic credit products, or derivatives tied to credit
performance. Dimon said the transactions, intended to manage
risk, were &#8220;egregious&#8221; failures by the bank&#8217;s chief investment
office. JPMorgan has said the amount could increase by $1
billion or more as it winds down the positions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for New York-based
JPMorgan, declined to comment on the $5 billion estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan fell 0.5 percent to $33.77 by 10 a.m. in German
trading, after closing at $33.93 in New York yesterday, down 4.3
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. lender by assets didn&#8217;t have a treasurer
during the five months when the trades took place, the Journal
reported in a separate article. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s chief investment office oversees about $360
billion, or the difference between deposits and what the bank
lends. Matt Zames, who was appointed to lead the division after
the loss was reported, shook up leadership and announced a
&#8220;renewed focus&#8221; on hedging risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Regulatory Overhaul &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loss has prompted the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
to examine how banks in its district are managing cash after
receiving a flood of deposits since the credit crisis, according
to a person familiar with the matter. Dimon, 56, has agreed to
testify before a Senate committee that&#8217;s debating whether to
tighten rules on trading by U.S. lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and regulators face pressure to explain the loss
as lawmakers haggle over rules for the Dodd-Frank regulatory
overhaul enacted two years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation in New York have begun a criminal probe of the
trading loss, a person familiar with the matter has said. The
inquiry is in its most preliminary stage, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company was trying to reposition a portfolio of
corporate credit derivatives and used a trading strategy that
was &#8220;flawed, complex, poorly conceived, poorly vetted and
poorly executed,&#8221; Dimon told shareholders this week at the
bank&#8217;s annual meeting in Tampa, Florida. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irvin Goldman, who oversaw risks in
the JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) unit that suffered more than $2 billion
in trading losses, was fired by another Wall Street firm in 2007
for money-losing bets that prompted a regulatory sanction at the
firm, Cantor Fitzgerald LP, three people with direct knowledge
of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan appointed Goldman in February as the top risk
official in its chief investment office while the unit was
managing trades that later spiraled into what Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon called &#8220;egregious,&#8221; self-inflicted
mistakes. The bank knew when it picked Goldman that his earlier
work at Cantor led regulators to penalize that company,
according to a person briefed on the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s oversight of risk in its chief investment office
has become a focal point as U.S. authorities examine the
incident and lawmakers debate how to prevent banks from making
wagers that might endanger depositors. Goldman was given the
risk-oversight job after his brother-in-law, Barry Zubrow, 59,
stepped down in January as JPMorgan&#8217;s top risk official to
become head of corporate and regulatory affairs, according to a
person briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less than a week after the loss became public, the bank
stripped Goldman of his duties, though he remains at the firm,
according to a person familiar with the situation. Chetan
Bhargiri was named to succeed him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Admission &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cantor case culminated in 2010 when the enforcement arm
of NYSE Arca Inc. fined Cantor $250,000 after finding it failed
to supervise Goldman, 51, who was buying and selling the same
stocks in personal accounts that he traded in a proprietary
account at the New York-based brokerage. His stock investments,
one of which plunged in December of 2006, presented a conflict
of interest that could have affected his investment decisions,
NYSE Arca found, according to a settlement document on its
website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cantor settled the case without admitting or denying
wrongdoing. The NYSE document identified Goldman only by his
former title as CEO of debt capital markets at Cantor, and he
wasn&#8217;t directly accused by the watchdog of misconduct. People
with knowledge of his dismissal spoke on condition of anonymity
because the reasons for his departure were private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristin Lemkau, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined to
comment on Goldman&#8217;s actions at Cantor or the bank&#8217;s decision to
put him in charge of risk management. Goldman didn&#8217;t respond to
messages seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Administrative Leave &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is investigating whether anyone at the firm sought
to hide trading risks, people familiar with the matter have
said. It hasn&#8217;t found that Goldman did anything improper, one
person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s resume lists more than a decade of work in
trading and investments before he was appointed to be risk
chief. He spent 13 years at Credit Suisse First Boston and ran
sales and trading for interest-rate products, according to a
2003 statement on Cantor&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That year, he joined Cantor as president of debt capital
markets and asset management as the firm sought to rebuild from
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, which
killed 658 of its 960 New York-based employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After leaving Cantor, he joined JPMorgan&#8217;s chief investment
office as a trader, according to two people. As the NYSE inquiry
at Cantor progressed, he went on administrative leave at
JPMorgan, one person said. His trading book was down around that
time and his departure helped result in a loss of about $10
million to $15 million, the person said. The Wall Street Journal
reported that loss yesterday on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;London Trades &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ina Drew, then head of JPMorgan&#8217;s chief investment office,
reenlisted Goldman to help with strategy at her unit after
Cantor settled the NYSE&#8217;s inquiry in 2010, according to two
people. He was head of risk strategy before his appointment in
February, when the company&#8217;s main risk officer, John Hogan,
named Goldman the unit&#8217;s head of risk, one of the people said.
While others at the bank knew about Goldman&#8217;s firing from
Cantor, Hogan wasn&#8217;t aware when he appointed him to the job, the
person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drew retired four days after Dimon announced the CIO loss
on May 10. For years, Dimon had sought to transform the unit and
increase the size of its speculative bets, former employees have
said. The firm hired Achilles Macris, 50, in 2006 to oversee
trading in London and lead an expansion into corporate and
mortgage-debt investments with a mandate to generate profits,
three former employees have said. One London trader, Bruno Iksil, amassed positions so big he began driving price moves in
the $10 trillion market for derivatives linked to the financial
health of corporations, Bloomberg News reported on April 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Criminal Investigation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 13, Dimon called news about the London trades a
&#8220;complete tempest in a teapot.&#8221; As the positions fueled losses
in the following days, Hogan removed Goldman from much of his
duties, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation in New York have begun a criminal probe of the
trading loss, a person familiar with the matter has said. The
Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing the transactions
and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission voted May 18 to
open an investigation, according to two people briefed on the
matter. The U.K. Financial Services Authority, which regulates
banks, is examining the role played by employees in London,
where the trading occurred, people familiar with the talks have
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NYSE investigators focused on Goldman&#8217;s trading in shares
of Forbes Medi-Tech Inc. and Immunicon Corp. In October 2005, he
bought Forbes Medi-Tech, a Vancouver-based biotech firm, for his
retirement account, a joint account with his wife and trust
accounts for his two children, according to Cantor&#8217;s settlement.
Goldman also started buying the shares for a Cantor proprietary
account in January 2006, accumulating more than 3.4 million by
March 2 of that year, the document shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Dozens&#8217; of Orders &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2006 the biotech company announced
disappointing results for a clinical trial of its cholesterol-reducing drug, prompting the shares to drop. Goldman sold the
stake in the proprietary account over the next several days,
continuing to trade in personal accounts for another nine
months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He accumulated more than 2 million shares of Immunicon, a
Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania-based maker of cancer diagnostic
tests, for Cantor in 2006, while buying as many as 367,000
shares for his personal account, according to the NYSE. On some
days, Goldman placed &#8220;dozens of buy and sell orders,&#8221; often
&#8220;within minutes of each other,&#8221; according to the settlement
document. Immunicon filed for bankruptcy protection in June
2008, agreeing to sell most of its assets to a unit of Johnson 
Johnson, the New Brunswick, New Jersey-based maker of health-care products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NYSE found that Cantor failed to monitor Goldman&#8217;s
personal bets. The firm&#8217;s own policies also barred traders from
making personal wagers on the same stocks they bought for
proprietary accounts, and it required them to hold their
personal investments for at least 10 days, the settlement shows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
sued a group of banks, including JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Citigroup
Inc. (C), Bank of America Securities and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), in two
suits over mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDIC, acting as receiver for two failed banks, filed
the suits in New York federal court today seeking money the
banks allegedly lost on securities backed by residential
mortgages. The suits claim a total of $77 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDIC filed an $11 million claim as receiver for
Strategic Capital Bank, a Champaign, Illinois commercial bank
that was closed by regulators in 2009. It filed a separate
$66 million claim on behalf of Strategic Capital and Citizens
National Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDIC alleges the defendants misled investors in the
registration statements for the securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott Helfman, a spokesman for Citigroup, declined to
comment on the suits, as did Bank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson and Deutsche Bank spokeswoman Renee Calabro. Phone calls
to Joseph Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, weren&#8217;t immediately
returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation v.

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) suspended its
daily stock repurchase program because the bank needs money
to meet international capital rules, not because of the size of 
trading losses, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quarterly dividend won&#8217;t change, Dimon said during an
investor conference today in Manhattan where analysts peppered
him with questions about how the New York-based firm&#8217;s chief
investment office racked up at least $2 billion in losses since
March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan agreed with regulators to increase capital levels
to &#8220;what we think our Basel III target will be,&#8221; Dimon said,
referring to international bank rules that require the largest
global financial companies to maintain higher capital levels.
While Dimon said he intends to restart buybacks, he won&#8217;t say
when. &#8220;We want to box those things first,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, is under
pressure from investors and regulators to explain how the chief
investment office, which is assigned to manage excess cash while
minimizing risk, made wrong-way bets on illiquid credit
derivatives, some of them so large that they distorted market
prices. While the loss may increase, the affair is an &#8220;isolated
event&#8221; and the ensuing investigations aren&#8217;t likely to find any
big surprises, Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Carried Away &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s no outcome that will be a disaster for this
company,&#8221; Dimon said. &#8220;I am not sitting here worried about the
ultimate loss on this thing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan dropped 2.9 percent to close at $32.51 in New
York, erasing the last of this year&#8217;s gains. The shares have
fallen 20 percent since the loss was disclosed on May 10 and are
trading below tangible book value, which is the estimated value
of the company if it had to be liquidated today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is likely JPMorgan was told to stop buying back stock
by its primary regulator, the Federal Reserve,&#8221; said Ed Najarian, head of bank research at International Strategy 
Investment Group Inc., an independent research firm in New York.
&#8220;Based on Dimon&#8217;s previous comments, this is a price where he
would like to be buying back the stock.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon also told investors today that the CIO losses won&#8217;t
do any long-term damage to the company. &#8220;If that&#8217;s true and
you&#8217;d like to buy back stock at this price, the only reason not
to is because regulators told you to stop,&#8221; Najarian said in an
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Economic Animals&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $350 billion portfolio managed by the CIO has a very
short duration and an average credit rating of AA designed to
&#8220;very conservatively handle&#8221; interest-rate risks, Dimon said.
The synthetic credit derivatives at the heart of the losses were
&#8220;a part&#8221; of the broader portfolio, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon wouldn&#8217;t elaborate on holdings that caused the losses
beyond the $2 billion already disclosed. The CIO has $7 billion
in unrealized gains that may be used to offset the damage, he
said. To book those profits, JPMorgan would have to sell those
assets and close out the positions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s just not tax-efficient,&#8221; Dimon said. &#8220;Being
economic animals, we&#8217;re going to be very economic in how we
handle CIO.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Derivatives losses of at least $2
billion at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) show the need for extending
Dodd-Frank Act swap regulations to overseas trades, said Gary Gensler, chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading (RTSIX)
Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve had another stark reminder of how trades overseas
can quickly reverberate with losses coming back to the United
States,&#8221; Gensler said today in a speech at a Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority conference in Washington. &#8220;The bank here
in the U.S. is absorbing these losses&#8221; on trades conducted at
JPMorgan in London, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and other U.S. banks
have said Dodd-Frank rules designed to bolster oversight of the
derivatives market will hurt their ability to compete with
foreign-based rivals if the rules are applied to overseas
offices. The debate over the reach of Dodd-Frank overseas is
among the most controversial elements of the 2010 financial-
overhaul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a reminder that when we go forward with the
cross-border application of Dodd-Frank, that we not accept some
of the industry&#8217;s comments that we exempt those from Dodd-Frank
reforms,&#8221; Gensler said. In comments after his speech, Gensler
confirmed that the CFTC is investigating the credit derivatives
transactions that led to the JPMorgan loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Foreign Competition &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying Dodd-Frank margin requirements to overseas swaps
would &#8220;eviscerate our ability to serve clients overseas and
cede the global market to foreign competitors,&#8221; JPMorgan
Associate General Counsel Don Thompson said at a House Financial
Services Committee hearing Feb. 8. The International Swaps and
Derivatives Association Inc. and Institute for International
Bankers backed House legislation seeking to limit the
international reach of Dodd-Frank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House Agriculture Committee last week delayed a
committee vote on the legislation, citing a need to take more
time to debate potential unintended consequences of the measure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CFTC will soon propose guidelines for when Dodd-Frank
rules apply to overseas transactions and swap dealers, Gensler
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the midst of a default or a crisis, there is no
satisfactory way to really separate the risk of a bank and its
branches,&#8221; Gensler said in the speech. &#8220;Likewise, I believe
this must include transactions with overseas affiliates that are
guaranteed by a U.S. entity, as well as the overseas affiliates
operating as conduits for a U.S. entity&#8217;s swap activity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Extent of Guidelines &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the guidelines, Dodd-Frank clearing and collateral
rules may not apply to trades between overseas affiliates of
U.S. firms and foreign-based companies that don&#8217;t have a
guarantee from another U.S. company, Gensler said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen time and again that U.S. overseas branches,
overseas affiliates guaranteed by a U.S. entity, and overseas
affiliates acting as conduits for U.S. entities bring risk
crashing back onto U.S. shores,&#8221; Gensler said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gensler said he has concerns about the so-called Volcker
rule&#8217;s restrictions on proprietary trading being undermined by
exemptions for hedging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t want the permitted hedging to swallow up the
prohibition,&#8221; Gensler told reporters. &#8220;From my own experience,
the challenge when somebody uses a word like &#8216;portfolio hedging&#8217;
is it can mutate and morph into many things beyond hedging
specific positions, and though the statute uses the word
aggregate, I take it to mean still something specific -- that
there is real positions there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The riskiest part of the global
corporate bond market is driving relative yields on company debt
to the widest levels in more than three months as speculation
mounts that the economic recovery is faltering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to hold bonds rather than
government debt widened 22 basis points last week, the most
since November, to 305 basis points, or 3.05 percentage points,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. Spreads
on speculative-grade notes soared 54 to 713. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Every time I look at the high-yield bond market it&#8217;s
getting sicker,&#8221; Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive officer of
Los Angeles-based DoubleLine Capital LP, said May 17 at a
conference at Bloomberg LP headquarters in New York. His $24.7
billion DoubleLine Total Return Bond Fund has returned 4.1
percent this year, beating about 95 percent of rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concern is building that borrowers will have a harder time
meeting debt payments as Greece struggles through a political
crisis that may see it exit Europe&#8217;s common currency and send
the euro region into a recession. Retail sales in the U.S. rose
at the slowest pace of the year in April and in China, home
prices fell in a record number of cities. The global economy may
expand 2.27 percent this year, down from 2.83 percent in 2011,
according to Bloomberg surveys of analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sales Fall &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the U.S. to Europe and Asia, corporate bond sales are
falling, with issuance last week dropping 9.46 percent to $68.9
billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Harland Clarke
Holdings Corp., a San Antonio-based provider of checks to
financial institutions, Select Medical Holdings Corp. in
Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, and Toronto-based HudBay Minerals
Inc. pulled offerings, all citing market volatility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market&#8217;s tone has become decidedly jittery,&#8221; New
York-based Citigroup Inc. high-yield credit strategists Michael Anderson and Robert Feigenberg wrote in a report last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed-income strategists at JPMorgan Chase  Co. said in a
report to clients dated May 18 that they expect both investment-
grade and high-yield debt to underperform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in credit markets, the cost of protecting
corporate bonds from default in the U.S. declined from the
highest level in almost five months, with the Markit CDX North
America Investment Grade Index, which investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, declining by
2.2 basis points to a mid-price of 121.2 basis points as of
11:29 a.m. in New York, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. The index ended last week at the highest since Dec.
21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The index typically falls as investor confidence improves
and rises as it deteriorates. Credit-default swaps pay the buyer
face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the
value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000
annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goldman Most Active &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. two-year interest-rate swap spread, a measure of
bond market stress, declined 2.1 basis points to 35 basis points
as of 11:29 a.m. in New York. The gauge narrows when investors
favor assets such as corporate bonds and      widens when they
seek the perceived safety of government securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) are the most actively
traded dollar-denominated corporate securities by dealers today,
with 44 trades of $1 million or more as of 11:30 a.m. in New
York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Barclays Capital Global Aggregate Corporate Index has
lost 1.22 percent this month, paring returns for the year to
3.54 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Widening Spreads &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relative yields from the most creditworthy to the riskiest
borrowers have climbed from this year&#8217;s low of 264 basis points
on March 20, according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Global Broad Market Corporate  High Yield Index. Spreads are at
the widest since Feb. 2 following the biggest weekly expansion
since the period ended Nov. 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spreads on investment-grade company debt expanded 16 basis
points last week to 225 basis points, climbing from this year&#8217;s
low of 194 on March 20, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch&#8217;s Global Broad Market Corporate index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculative-grade spreads have reached the widest since
February from a 2012 low of 620 basis points on March 19,
according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global High Yield
Index. Last week&#8217;s increase was the biggest since the five days
ended Sept. 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The cash market finally saw some real weakness this week
as sentiment turned more negative,&#8221; Barclays Plc credit
strategists led by Jeffrey Meli and Bradley Rogoff in New York
said in a research note on May 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Record Low Yields &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall yields ended last week at 4.23 percent. While
that&#8217;s up from 4.06 percent on May 8, they&#8217;re still at about
record lows and compare with 8.73 percent at the height of the
credit crisis in March 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies have taken advantage of a drop in borrowing costs
in recent years to refinance debt and extend maturities,
bolstering their balance sheets and curbing defaults. Battle
Creek, Michigan-based Kellogg Co. (K), the biggest U.S. cereal
maker, obtained the lowest coupons in its history when it sold
$1.45 billion of three-, five- and 10-year debt last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Good cash flow and receptive capital markets, which are
generally allowing companies proactively to refinance maturities
and address potential covenant violations, underpin the
favorable corporate liquidity position,&#8221; analysts at Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service said last week in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bond spreads show that investors are starting to wonder
whether credit quality has peaked, given the political turmoil
in Europe and signs of a slowing economy elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Greece, Retail Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Greece, post-election attempts to form a ruling
coalition broke down last week, sending Greeks back to the polls
next month with surveys giving the lead to an anti-bailout party
that would tear up the conditions attached to 240 billion euros
($307 billion) of aid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., consumers took a break from a shopping spree
in prior months, as government reports show retail sales gained
0.1 percent in April following a 0.7 percent increase in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In China, the National Bureau of Statistics said May 18
that prices of new homes fell from a year earlier in 46 of the
70 cities it tracks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate bond sales worldwide compare with a weekly 2012
average of $79.5 billion, Bloomberg data show. Sales this month
total $198 billion, bringing the year-to-date total to $1.58
trillion. Sales this time last year were $1.6 trillion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harland Clarke cited &#8220;market conditions&#8221; for canceling an
offering of $295 million of senior secured notes, the company
said in a regulatory filing on May 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HudBay discontinued its $400 million sale of notes due 2020
announced last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Although the funding we were seeking was available to us,
poor overall market conditions caused the proposed interest rate
to exceed our cost of capital criteria,&#8221; Chief Executive
Officer David Garofalo said in a statement on May 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select Medical terminated its $365 million sale on May 14,
saying in a statement that the company &#8220;elected not to move
ahead with the refinancing due to the rates currently available
for the new debt financing in the market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) may face even
bigger losses on faulty bets in credit markets if Europe&#8217;s debt
crisis worsens, according to one of the hedge funds that took
the other side of the trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re not out of those positions,&#8221; Michael Platt, co-
founder and chief executive officer of BlueCrest Capital
Management LLP, said today in an interview on Bloomberg
Television&#8217;s &#8220;Inside Track.&#8221; &#8220;If we end up with a catastrophe
in Europe in the short run, they&#8217;re probably not positions that
anyone would want to have.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlueCrest, based in Geneva, manages $32 billion. Platt said
a credit fund run by his firm took a &#8220;small&#8221; position against
JPMorgan after finding &#8220;anomalies&#8221; in the pricing of certain
credit derivatives. BlueCrest would make money as the prices
corrected, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, is seeking to
stanch losses in its chief investment office as other hedge 
funds exploit its money-losing positions by trading in indexes 
tied to credit-default swaps. New York-based JPMorgan revealed 
a $2 billion loss on May 10, and CEO Jamie Dimon said it could 
increase by as much as $1 billion this quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s positions were built by Bruno Iksil, a JPMorgan
trader nicknamed the &#8220;London whale&#8221; because his bets had
become so large, Bloomberg News reported on April 5. Traders on
the other side, known as counterparties, say the market has
since moved even further against JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hedges Questioned &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platt said he doubted Dimon&#8217;s explanation that the trades
had spawned from hedges intended to protect the value of credit
assets such as corporate loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think they could be described in any way as a
hedge,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s a trading loss. They
deliberately put the positions on. The London whale, who has
subsequently been harpooned, put the positions on.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platt said the crisis in Europe could worsen quickly if
Greece leaves the euro, a possibility now being discussed by
European politicians. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The order of events would be Greek exit, shock wave
across Europe, massive stress in banks, Spain turns into the
battleground for the euro, because of the stresses in their own
banking system,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Then we either get a very swift and
strong European solution or we get a hugely disorderly meltdown
in Europe.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platt, 44, is a former trader for JPMorgan who founded
BlueCrest in 2000. He said the hedge fund took its positions
against the bank &#8220;in the normal course of our business&#8221; and
&#8220;not looking to try and cause them any problem.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Able to Exit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, 56, has said JPMorgan is in no rush to unwind the
trades, even if adverse market moves produce bigger losses in
the short term. Platt said he agrees with that approach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They would ultimately be able to exit this position,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I would be looking, if I was in that position,
creatively at finding other avenues to reduce the value at risk
of the book.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a conference organized by Deutsche Bank AG today Dimon
called the trading loss an isolated event and said JPMorgan is
making progress in efforts to limit fallout. The positions are
&#8220;very volatile right now,&#8221; though less so than previously, he
said, declining to answer a question on how big the loss may
get. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects name of investor in 12th paragraph.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the bank
which last week doubled its money from a 2010 bet on Facebook
Inc. (FB), is ramping up investments in Web startups, underscoring
the allure of high-growth tech companies to financiers far from
Silicon Valley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs led a $52 million round of funding in
AnchorFree, the Mountain View, California-based maker of
Internet-surfing software said today in a statement. The bank is
also in talks to invest in Spotify Ltd. in a deal that would
value the London-based music-streaming service at up to $4
billion, a person familiar with the matter said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman
Sachs increased the size of its trading and investing operations
before the financial crisis, helping to make it the most
profitable securities firm in Wall Street history. The company
has funded rising technology startups including Facebook,
LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD), Dropbox Inc., Gilt Groupe Inc., Uber
Technologies Inc., and ZocDoc Inc. In addition to providing
quick returns, relationships with these companies could help the
bank get mandates to handle their initial public offerings or
acquisitions, said Bill Gurley, a venture capitalist at
Benchmark Capital in Menlo Park, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re active in the private market and they certainly
would relish the opportunity to have a relationship with someone
who might become a banking client somewhere down the road via an
IPO or M  A,&#8221; Gurley said in an interview, referring to
mergers and acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;LinkedIn Investment &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Principal investing -- where Goldman Sachs uses its own
money, instead of clients&#8217; capital, to buy stakes in companies
or real estate -- has been a significant source of profits for
the firm in the past. Investing and lending, the Goldman Sachs
segments that records gains and losses from such holdings,
produced 7 percent of the bank&#8217;s revenue last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs raised $235 million selling its stake in
Facebook&#8217;s May 18 IPO at a valuation of more than twice the $50
billion level at which the firm made its December 2010
investment. Funds that Goldman Sachs manages for the firm&#8217;s
clients also raised $855 million in the IPO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which bought 871,840 LinkedIn shares in June
2008, sold all of them in that company&#8217;s IPO, according to
LinkedIn&#8217;s IPO prospectus. The IPO was priced at $45, meaning
Goldman Sachs collected $39.2 million at the time of the offer.
The bank could have more than doubled its money if it had held
the shares, which closed on May 18 at $99.02. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lone Institutional Investor &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AnchorFree invited Goldman Sachs to be the only new
institutional investor in its recent funding after turning down
offers from several venture-capital firms, said David Gorodyansky, the company&#8217;s chief executive officer. The Goldman
Sachs representatives participating in the deal, who Gorodyansky
declined to name, behaved more like Silicon Valley investors
than bankers, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They are investing the same way that any venture
capitalist would invest,&#8221; Gorodyansky said. &#8220;They are very
savvy product people.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-founded by Gorodyansky in 2005, AnchorFree provides a
so-called proxy service, which lets users connect to the
Internet via remote servers so that they can&#8217;t be tracked and so
residents of countries like China and Iran can skirt censors
enforced by governments. With the new cash, the company plans to
buy servers and hire engineers to help with its push into mobile
Web browsing, Gorodyansky said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Web Advertising &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AnchorFree, which previously raised $11 million from
Landmark Ventures and others, is profitable and makes money by
selling ads to Web surfers as well as premium versions of its
software with more capabilities, Gorodyansky said. Goldman Sachs
will get a seat on its board of directors as part of the funding
agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s potential investment in Spotify could help
the bank get access to a fast-growing business which expects to
exceed 6 billion kronor ($833 million) in revenue this year,
according to an interview its CEO Daniel Ek gave to Dagens
Industri. Spotify raised $100 million last year from venture
capital investors including DST Global, Accel Partners and
Kleiner Perkins Caufield  Byers, achieving a valuation of about
$1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with Facebook, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s investments in tech
startups may not ensure it a leading spot on any future deals.
Gorodyansky has not set plans for a public offering but said
that Goldman Sachs&#8217;s investment will not give it preference over
other banks should that opportunity arise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have got no obligations,&#8221; Gorodyansky said. &#8220;If we
wanted to do an IPO we could do with anyone.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs works with clients &#8220;as their needs dictate,
which can mean providing advice or financing, whether debt or
equity,&#8221; David Wells, a company spokesman, said in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
OfficerJamie Dimon said the firm doesn&#8217;t see any scenario in
which trading losses in its chief investment office would amount
to a disaster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re looking at all the potential outcomes&#8221; from the
unit&#8217;s trades, Dimon said at an investor conference today in
lower Manhattan. &#8220;There&#8217;s no outcome that will be a disaster
for this company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade had resulted in about $2 billion in losses as of
May 10, an amount Dimon said at the time could widen by $1
billion this quarter. It remains &#8220;very volatile right now,&#8221;
though less so than previously, he said today, declining to
answer a question on how large it may get. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I am not sitting here worried about the ultimate loss on
this thing,&#8221; Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon may give investors &#8220;a better explanation&#8221;
of how the bank lost $2 billion on trading and whether the
dividend is safe when he appears at an investor conference later
today, according to Citigroup Inc. (C) analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A lot of investors&#8217; concerns have gotten to extreme
levels,&#8221; wrote Citigroup&#8217;s Keith Horowitz in a note to clients.
Dimon&#8217;s presentation may include &#8220;we would hope a very clear
statement that dividend is not at risk and that buybacks are
still expected in 2012.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup called New York-based JPMorgan, the biggest U.S.
bank by assets, an &#8220;absolute buy,&#8221; saying that estimates on
the ultimate size of the trading loss &#8220;are getting a bit
carried away.&#8221; A dividend cut is very unlikely, Horowitz wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon is scheduled to speak at 9:30 a.m. New York time at a
conference sponsored by Deutsche Bank AG in lower Manhattan.
He&#8217;s under pressure from investors and regulators to explain how
the bank&#8217;s chief investment office, which is assigned to manage
excess cash while minimizing risk, wound up with a $2 billion
loss from trades in illiquid credit derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon announced the loss May 10 and said it could expand in
coming weeks. He assailed the bank&#8217;s handling of trading in
credit derivatives as &#8220;flawed, complex, poorly reviewed, poorly
executed and poorly monitored.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil rose for the first time in seven
days in New York after China pledged to boost the nation&#8217;s
economy and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the balance between
supply and demand of crude is tightening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West Texas Intermediate futures gained as much as 0.8
percent after settling at the lowest level in almost seven
months on May 18. The extent of oil&#8217;s decline was unwarranted,
Goldman said in a report. China will focus more on bolstering
economic growth, the official Xinhua News Agency reported
yesterday, citing Premier Wen Jiabao. Crude&#8217;s relative strength
index remained below 30, signaling it may be oversold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chinese growth continues to be sustained and robust,&#8221;
said Christopher Bellew, senior broker at Jefferies Bache Ltd.
in London. &#8220;The emphasis for oil prices is ultimately where
demand is growing the most strongly, such as China and India.
Prices seem to have found a bottom at last.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude for June delivery rose as much as 72 cents to $92.20
a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange and was at $91.83 at 1:33 p.m. London time. It fell 1.2
percent on May 18 to $91.48, the lowest close since Oct. 26 and
expires today. The more-active July contract climbed 33 cents to
$92.13. Prices are 7 percent lower this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent oil for July settlement rose 82 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $107.96 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The front-month European benchmark contract was at a
premium to West Texas Intermediate of $15.81. Last week, the gap
narrowed 4.9 percent with the activation of a pipeline that may
ease a glut in U.S. crude inventories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seaway Link &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD) and Enbridge Inc. (ENB) started
shipping oil on May 19 through the 150,000 barrel-a-day Seaway
pipeline from Cushing, Oklahoma, to Houston-area refineries, the
companies said in a statement that day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Despite concerns over the softening economic data, oil
demand continues to improve,&#8221; David Greely, head of energy
research at Goldman Sachs in New York, said in the e-mailed
report. &#8220;The supply of oil actually available to the market is
increasingly constrained by the inability of Iran to market its
oil owing to the effects of US and European sanctions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil in New York has long-term technical support at $89.83 a
barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. On the weekly
chart, that&#8217;s the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the
intraday decline to $32.40 in December 2008 from a record high
of $147.27 in July that year. Futures last traded at that price
in November 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Saudi Supplies &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude&#8217;s 14-day RSI has been below 30 since May 11,
signaling further losses may not be sustainable. Buy orders tend
to be clustered near chart-support levels. The RSI was at 23
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent, the benchmark price for more than half the world&#8217;s
petroleum, has dropped about 3 percent since May 13, when Saudi
Arabia&#8217;s Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said it should fall to $100 a
barrel because global supply is outweighing demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices slid earlier after Saudi Arabia&#8217;s output in March
climbed to the second-highest level in at least 31 years before
a European embargo on Iran that starts in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With Saudi ramping up production to meet the need for oil
once sanctions against Iran come into full effect, the oil
market was pushed into surplus this year,&#8221; Greely said.
&#8220;However, as Iranian supplies are increasingly shut out from
the market as the sanctions take effect, that surplus is
disappearing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia increased daily crude output to 9.923 million
barrels in March, according to the Joint Organization Data
Initiative. That surpassed Russia, which pumped 9.92 million
barrels a day, for the first time in six years. JODI is
supervised by the Riyadh-based International Energy Forum and
compiles data provided by member governments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Iran Progress &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil has also fallen this month amid speculation the U.S.
and its allies will use strategic supplies to protect the global
economy as they prepare for the EU ban on imports from Iran. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negotiations about the Persian Gulf nation&#8217;s nuclear
program have made &#8220;good progress,&#8221; Yukiya Amano, director
general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said
yesterday before departing on a flight to Tehran. Amano will
meet with the country&#8217;s top nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money managers cut net-long positions on New York crude by
6 percent to 139,182 contracts, the lowest since September 2010,
in the seven days ended May 15, according to the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission&#8217;s Commitments of Traders report on
May 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bets Reduced &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In London, hedge funds and other money managers cut bullish
bets on Brent crude by 6,148 contracts, or 5.9 percent, in the
week ended May 15, according to data from ICE Futures Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long positions, or speculative bets that prices will
increase, in futures and options combined, outnumbered short
positions by 97,625 compared with 103,773 lots the previous
week, the London-based exchange said today in its weekly
Commitment of Traders report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average price for regular gasoline at U.S. filling
stations fell 6.19 cents in the past two weeks to $3.7833 a
gallon, according to Lundberg Survey Inc. The survey is based on
information received from about 2,500 stations by the Camarillo,
California-based company. The price is 12.41 cents lower than a
year earlier, when the average was $3.9074. The highest average
this year was $3.9671, during the two weeks ended April 6. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil rose for the first time in seven
days in New York after China pledged to boost the nation&#8217;s
economy and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the balance between
supply and demand of crude is tightening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures gained as much as 0.7 percent after settling at the
lowest level in almost seven months on May 18. The extent of
oil&#8217;s decline was unwarranted, Goldman said in a report. China
will focus more on bolstering economic growth, the official
Xinhua News Agency reported yesterday, citing Premier Wen Jiabao. Prices slid earlier after Saudi Arabia&#8217;s output in March
climbed to the second-highest level in at least 31 years before
a European embargo on Iran that starts in July. Crude&#8217;s relative
strength index remained below 30, signaling it may be oversold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve gone through downside technical targets and could
be near a bottom,&#8221; said Anthony Nunan, a senior adviser for
risk management at Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) in Tokyo. &#8220;Inventories have
been building worldwide, basically preparing for the contingency
if Iran production should drop after the import ban in July.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude for June delivery rose as much as 67 cents to $92.15
a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange and was at $92.06 at 8:30 a.m. London time. It fell 1.2
percent on May 18 to $91.48, the lowest close since Oct. 26 and
expires today. The more-actively traded July contract climbed 54
cents to $92.34. Front-month prices are 7 percent lower this
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent oil for July settlement rose 61 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $107.75 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The front-month price for the European
benchmark contract was at a premium to West Texas Intermediate
of $15.40. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Saudi Supplies &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil has also fallen this month amid speculation the U.S.

International Energy Agency has no definite plan to release fuel
from its emergency reserves, David Fyfe, head of its oil

&lt;p&gt;An Andy Warhol portrait of Brigitte Bardot was among the top lots in a $56 million sale of artworks
that were owned by the actress&#8217;s late husband. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1974 dark-red silkscreen, based on a 1959 photo by
Richard Avedon, was sold last night for the heirs of Gunter
Sachs, the German multimillionaire who was married to the French
movie star from 1966 to 1969. It fetched 3 million pounds ($4.7
million) at Sotheby&#8217;s in London as the first session of the two-day auction raised 35.6 million pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event followed a $1 billion series of Impressionist and
contemporary art auctions in New York earlier this month at
which wealthy international buyers were paying record prices for
investment-quality works by bankable names. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Bardot was the bargain of the night,&#8221; the Montreal-based collector Francois Odermatt said in an interview. &#8220;We
shouldn&#8217;t judge Sachs&#8217;s taste just from this sale. The family
has kept a lot of the best pieces. After these results, they
might do a Gunter Sachs II auction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was one of eight paintings of his ex-wife that Sachs
commissioned from Warhol in 1972 to decorate his &#8220;Pop Art
apartment&#8221; in the Palace Hotel, St. Moritz. It was valued by
Sotheby&#8217;s (BID) at 3 million pounds to 4 million pounds and was bought
by a telephone bidder, underbid by the New York collector Jose Mugrabi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The colors of this particular Warhol were less attractive
than another example that fetched 5.4 million pounds at
Christie&#8217;s International in 2007, dealers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Playboy Collector&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheyenne Westphal, Sotheby&#8217;s European head of contemporary
art, confirmed in the post-sale news conference that the family
of the &#8220;cosmopolitan playboy collector&#8221; has chosen retain works,
though she didn&#8217;t specify how many. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sachs was one of the most flamboyant members of the
international &#8220;jet set&#8221; of the 1960s and 1970s. Bardot was the
second of his three wives. The German auto heir, bobsleigh
champion and art collector courted the actress by flying over
her Cote d&#8217;Azur home, La Madrague, in a helicopter and bombing
it with red roses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 300 works had been consigned for sale at Sotheby&#8217;s
following Sachs&#8217;s suicide at his chalet in Gstaad, Switzerland,
in May 2011, at the age of 78. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The portrait was one of seven Warhol pieces in a 41-lot
evening sale of Pop Art and furniture from his collection. Last
night&#8217;s session beat a forecast of 18.25 million pounds to 25.6
million pounds with Warhol capturing six out of the 10 highest
prices. All but four of the lots found buyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;St. Tropez &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sachs became a friend of Warhol after the two met in St.
Tropez in the early 1960s. Sachs organized an exhibition for the
artist at his own gallery in Hamburg in 1972. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warhol&#8217;s 1986 pink &#8220;Fright Wig,&#8221; one of the artist&#8217;s last
self-portraits, was the collection&#8217;s most expensive work,
selling to an unidentified bidder in the room for 5.4 million
pounds against an estimate of 2 million pounds to 3 million
pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had been bought by Sachs at auction in 1998, while the
1964-65 silkscreen &#8220;Flowers&#8221; had been acquired by the collector
from the Zurich dealer Bruno Bischofberger in 1979. It sold to
Mugrabi for 3.7 million pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mugrabi was one of more than a dozen unsuccessful bidders
on a complete set of three pieces of 1969 mannequin furniture by
the British-born Pop artist Allen Jones, each featuring a
provocatively posed leather-clad female figure. The works had
decorated Sachs&#8217;s bedroom at St. Moritz. From an edition of six,
they were valued at 30,000 pounds to 40,000 pounds each. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Intense Competition &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They excited intense competition before the hat stand,
chair and table sold to the same bidder represented by Alexander
Rotter, head of contemporary art at Sotheby&#8217;s New York, for
successive record prices of 780,450 pounds, 836,450 pounds and
970,850 pounds each. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I remember when a set of these came up for auction in the
early 1980s,&#8221; Mugrabi said in an interview. &#8220;They sold for about
$15,000. I thought they were too vulgar then. Taste evolves and
they now appeal to the new generation of collectors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more of a surprise was the 1.6 million pounds given
for a set of three pieces of 1968 &#8220;sheep&#8221; furniture by French
designer Francois-Xavier Lalanne. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an original flock of 16 in Sachs&#8217;s St. Moritz
apartment, they had been estimated at 250,000 pounds to 350,000
pounds. Bidders had been emboldened by the $7.4 million for 10
epoxy stone and bronze sheep pieces by Lalanne from a Japanese
sculpture park at a Christie&#8217;s design sale in New York in
December, dealers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After today&#8217;s part II session of the Sachs collection,
Sotheby's said the final total was 41.5 million pounds with 
fees, double the lower presale estimate of 20.7 million
pounds at hammer prices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank, has hired former U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission enforcement chief William McLucas to help respond to
regulatory probes of the firm&#8217;s $2 billion trading loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lender retained law firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale 
Dorr LLP, where McLucas is a partner, shortly after the bank
disclosed the loss on May 10, said Kristin Lemkau, a spokeswoman
for New York-based JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probes began after JPMorgan traders in London built up
positions in illiquid credit derivatives that were so large they
distorted market prices and eventually led to what Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon called &#8220;self-inflicted&#8221; losses
that may grow. That spurred reviews by the SEC, Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency and Federal Bureau of Investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our focus right now is on whether the company&#8217;s public
disclosure and financial reporting is accurate,&#8221; SEC Chairman
Mary Schapiro said today in congressional testimony. &#8220;The
agencies collectively, including the criminal authorities, are
working very hard to untangle what happened at the firm.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC is reviewing the accuracy and timing of JPMorgan&#8217;s
disclosure of changes in how it calculates value-at-risk, or
VaR, which shows how much it could lose from trading most days,
Schapiro said. The bank changed its VaR model for the chief
investment office during the first quarter without telling
investors. The new model, which has since been scrapped, had cut
the risk estimation almost in half, Dimon told investors May 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disclosure of Changes &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When there are changes to the VaR model, &#8220;those changes
have to be disclosed&#8221; to the public, said Schapiro, 56. When
companies report large trading losses, &#8220;we actually make them
back-test and provide us with full information about why their
estimates of losses were so far off,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McLucas, 61, led the SEC&#8217;s enforcement division from 1989
to 1998 and represented board committees in the collapses of
Enron Corp. and WorldCom Inc. He didn&#8217;t reply to a phone call
and e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The losses occurred in a portfolio of credit investments
overseen in London by JPMorgan&#8217;s chief investment office, which
manages risks. The company used a trading strategy that was
&#8220;flawed, complex, poorly conceived, poorly vetted and poorly
executed,&#8221; Dimon, 56, has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s general counsel and most senior lawyer, Stephen Cutler, also previously served as the head of enforcement at the
SEC. Cutler, 50, worked with McLucas at WilmerHale from 2005 to
2007, before JPMorgan hired him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) are among banks that were sued for $1.8 billion
in New York over the sale of mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks made misrepresentations about the loans backing
the securities, according to a summons filed today in New York
State Supreme Court. Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN),
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) and Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s
Merrill Lynch unit are also named as defendants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs, which include Phoenix Light SF Ltd. and
Blue Heron Funding II Ltd., are seeking a total of $1.8 billion
in damages, according to the court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, Steven Vames, a Credit Suisse spokesman, Bank of America spokesman
Lawrence Grayson, and RBS spokesman Ed Canaday declined to
comment. Representatives of JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley (MS) didn&#8217;t
respond to e-mails seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Phoenix Light SF Ltd. v. J.P. Morgan Securities
LLC, 651755-2012, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dollar may strengthen against all
its major peers except the yen amid a possible Greek exit from
the euro and economic slowdowns in China and the U.S., according
to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Regardless of country-specific strengths outside Europe,
no currency but the yen could appreciate versus the dollar
during the deleveraging and volatility spike,&#8221; Kevin Hebner, a
foreign-exchange strategist for JPMorgan in London, wrote to
clients today. &#8220;For the second time in six months, Greece&#8217;s
Economic and Monetary Union exit seems imminent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank reduced its euro forecast to $1.22
for the second quarter from a $1.34 estimate as of May 11. The
17-nation currency will trade at $1.24 by year-end, compared
with a previous forecast of $1.36. It traded at $1.27 today in
New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greek elections are scheduled for June 17 after an
inconclusive vote in May propelled an anti-bailout party to
second place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth-linked currencies may weaken against the dollar as
an economic slowdown in China may trim commodity prices.
Canada&#8217;s dollar will weaken to C$1.04 by mid-year compared with
98 cents per U.S. dollar, the report said. Australia&#8217;s dollar
may fall to 96 U.S. cents versus $1.08 and New Zealand&#8217;s
currency will trade at 73 U.S. cents, down from 82 U.S. cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar may weaken to 78 yen at the end of the second
quarter. It traded at 79.98 today. &lt;/p&gt;

dividend of 0.24 liras per share on May 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Icecek climbed as much as 9.5 percent to a record
high before paring gains to 4.6 percent and closing at 24.90
liras, its strongest in almost a month. The company made the
statement on the dividend to the Istanbul Stock Exchange after
markets closed yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) was sued by a
former employee seeking to represent participants in the bank&#8217;s
retirement plan who lost money on company stock the plan held
after the bank reported a $2 billion trading loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint filed yesterday by Gregory Scrydloff in
Manhattan federal court accuses New York-based JPMorgan of
making misstatements about its financial health that allowed the
company&#8217;s stock to trade at inflated prices between April 13,
when the company reported earnings, and May 10, when Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon disclosed the trading loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, an Arizona trust filed a securities-fraud
lawsuit seeking to represent all investors who lost money on the
stock as a result of alleged misstatements by the bank about its
losses. In another case filed last week, an individual investor
asked for damages on behalf of the company from Dimon, the
bank&#8217;s board and other executives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trading losses came on synthetic credit products, which
are derivatives tied to credit performance. In disclosing the
$2 billion loss on transactions he said were intended to manage
risk, Dimon cited &#8220;egregious&#8221; failures by the bank&#8217;s chief
investment office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to
comment on the most recent lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The employee case is Scrydloff v. JPMorgan Chase  Co., 12-4027, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). The earlier cases are Baker v. Dimon, 12-cv-03878,
and Saratoga Advantage Trust -- Financial Services Portfolio,
12-cv-03879, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey&#8217;s benchmark ISE National 100
Index (XU100) rose 0.3 percent to 56,684.20 at 3:30 p.m in Istanbul,
snapping three days of losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following shares are active. Stock symbols are in

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Icecek AS (CCOLA) , the Turkish bottler of
Coca-Cola Co. (KO) drinks, gained as much as 9.5 percent to a record
high before trading up 0.8 percent at 24 liras. The company will
pay a gross dividend of 0.24 liras per share on May 25, it said
in a statement to the Istanbul Stock Exchange after the market
close yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Escort Computer (ESCOM) Elektronik Sanayi  Ticaret AS (ESCOM TI),
a manufacturer and importer of computers, gained 1.5 percent to
10.45 liras. Escort started talks with Gemia Inc. for an 18
million-lira ($10 million) loan or a facility convertible to
equity within three years, it said in a statement to the
exchange today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polyester Sanayi AS (SASA) , a producer of polyester
fibers, yarns and plastic bottles, dropped 9.4 percent to 1.25
liras, snapping three days of gains. The shares had been rising
after reports Turkey would impose anti-dumping measures on
polyester fiber imports from Indonesia and South Korea,
according to Istanbul-based brokerage BGC Partners. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Treasuries investors cut bets
the securities will advance, and raised neutral and short
positions this week, according to a weekly survey by JPMorgan
Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The percent of &#8220;net longs&#8221; dropped to four percentage
points in the week ending yesterday, from 11 percentage points
the previous week when it reached the highest level in more than
two months. The number of outright longs dropped to 21 percent
in the week ending yesterday, from 26 percent, the survey
showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The percent of shorts rose to 17 percent from 15 percent in
the same period. A long position is a bet that an asset will
increase in value, while a short is a wager it will decrease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The percent of &#8220;neutrals&#8221; rose to 62 percent from 59
percent. It had risen to 66 percent in the week ending May 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmark 10-year yield rose four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 1.78 percent at 7:52 a.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan doesn&#8217;t disclose the number of clients in the

&lt;p&gt;The 1.1 trillion-euro ($1.4 trillion)
liquidity buffer that Europe&#8217;s biggest banks have to guard
against a flight of deposits will be insufficient if there&#8217;s a
systemic loss of confidence, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the buffer would be ample to protect against the loss
of confidence and a run on deposits at a single bank, it would
be inadequate if customers withdrew their money across the
region, the analysts including Jernej Omahen wrote in a note to
clients today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If deposit loss occurs as a result of a systemic event,
individual liquidity buffers would not prove effective,&#8221; they
wrote. &#8220;Fears of a euro breakup, for example, could give rise
to loss of depositor confidence on a systemic level. This would
call for a regulatory response.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greece&#8217;s banking system lost 9 billion euros of deposits
this year and has seen outflows of 73 billion euros since the
2009 peak, the analysts said. Speculation that customers were
withdrawing money in Spain caused a 29 percent drop in the
shares of Bankia SA (BKIA) on May 17. The Spanish government denied
reports of a run on deposits at Bankia last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there was concern that deposit flight had spread
beyond Greece to the rest of Southern Europe, there was no
supporting evidence, the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;

Moore" date="May 22, 2012 12:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-22/jpmorgan-veered-from-hedging-practices-at-competing-banks.html"><headline>JPMorgan Veered From Hedging Practices at Competing Banks</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s biggest U.S.
competitors say their corporate investment offices avoid the use
of derivatives that led to the bank&#8217;s $2 billion loss and buy
fewer bonds exposed to credit risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. (C) and Wells Fargo  Co.
say the offices don&#8217;t trade credit-default swaps on indexes
linked to the health of companies. JPMorgan is said to have
amassed positions in such indexes that were so large they drove
price moves in the $10 trillion market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loss has prompted shareholders to join regulators in
scrutinizing how banks use their investment offices to hedge
risks and manage deposits they aren&#8217;t using for loans.
JPMorgan&#8217;s competitors confine corporate-level trading mostly to
interest-rate and currency swaps -- the most common derivatives
-- and put a greater percentage of funds into U.S. government-
backed securities such as Treasury bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Traditionally, banks use government bonds, because
they&#8217;re safer,&#8221; said Ray Soifer, a former Brown Brothers
Harriman  Co. bank analyst who&#8217;s now chairman of Green Valley,
Arizona-based Soifer Consulting LLC, which advises banks and
investors on strategy and risk management. &#8220;JPMorgan is going
down the credit spectrum from U.S. Treasuries, because they&#8217;re
reaching for yield.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seeking Returns &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concentration of assets that carry the risk a borrower
might default reflects JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon&#8217;s push over the past five years to seek higher returns at
the New York-based bank&#8217;s chief investment office, as reported
by Bloomberg News April 13. Dimon said at an investment
conference yesterday that the bank has more of such assets than
competitors, while asserting it isn&#8217;t taking undue risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have more credit exposure than other people, and we
think when we put that credit exposure on, it was actually very
good,&#8221; said Dimon, 56. &#8220;We bought some triple-A securities
that we think are as good as gold.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About half of the $381.7 billion in JPMorgan&#8217;s chief
investment office portfolio is in company bonds, asset-backed
securities and mortgage debt not backed by the U.S. government,
according to a March 31 filing. That compares with 7.7 percent
at the end of 2007. The amount, $188.1 billion, is more than the
holdings of such securities by its three biggest competitors
combined. It exceeds the total assets of Atlanta-based SunTrust
Banks Inc., the 10th-biggest U.S. lender. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar assets at San Francisco-based Wells Fargo (WFC) represent
34 percent of a $230.3 billion portfolio. It&#8217;s 11 percent of New
York-based Citigroup&#8217;s $270.6 billion book, and 10 percent of
the $297.1 billion pool of securities at Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fewer Treasury Bonds &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has about 30 percent of its holdings in U.S.
Treasuries and bonds issued or guaranteed by U.S. government-
backed agencies, according to its filings. That compares with 87
percent at Bank of America, 50 percent at Citigroup and 47
percent at Wells Fargo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The payoff: JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, gets a yield
of 3.2 percent on its corporate bonds, compared with 1 percent
for Treasuries and debt issued by government-backed agencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pressure to take bigger risks has increased as the
Federal Reserve keeps benchmark interest rates near zero,
shrinking the returns banks can get from keeping their money in
short-term U.S. government bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Credit-Heavy&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is &#8220;more credit-heavy&#8221; than other banks, said
David Hendler, an analyst with CreditSights Inc. in New York.
&#8220;It&#8217;s just another indication that they&#8217;re searching for yield
like other money managers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup senior managers were getting so many questions
about corporate liquidity that Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach and Chief Risk Officer Brian Leach last week sent a
memo to staff outlining how the money is managed. Liquidity is
the term financial executives and regulators use to describe
cash or investments that can be easily sold and converted into
cash to meet redemption requests from depositors or pay off
short-term debts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are conservative in our mix of assets,&#8221; Gerspach and
Leach wrote in the May 14 memo. &#8220;There are clear risk limits
and parameters throughout the firm.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At issue is how banks manage their securities portfolios --
the investments they buy with funds left over when deposits
exceed the amount of loans. Putting the money into bonds is
supposed to bring higher yields than the bank could get from
parking the money at the Fed, currently paying 0.25 percent on
deposits. The four biggest U.S. banks manage a combined $1.2
trillion in these portfolios. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Everyone Does It&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s holdings are overseen by the chief investment
office, where the flawed derivatives trades took place. The
former head of the unit, Ina Drew, reported directly to Dimon
until she resigned last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Think of this as a big fixed-income portfolio,&#8221; Dimon
said yesterday. &#8220;Almost every single bank, whether you call it
CIO or treasury, almost everyone does it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America&#8217;s portfolio is run by Chief Investment
Officer Walter Muller, who reports to CFO Bruce Thompson.
Citigroup Treasurer Eric Aboaf manages his bank&#8217;s pool,
overseeing a chief investment office and deputy treasurers in
countries outside the U.S. At Wells Fargo, the function is split
between CFO Tim Sloan and John Shrewsberry, who runs the
investment banking and trading division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Macroeconomic Risk &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The differences between JPMorgan and its competitors extend
to the use of credit derivatives by corporate investment offices
to hedge macroeconomic risks in the company, such as the
possibility that more loans might sour as unemployment rises.
While all four banks buy and sell credit-default swaps, such
transactions typically are done in trading departments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, on a May 10 conference call with analysts and
investors, said the bank&#8217;s losses stemmed from a &#8220;strategy to
hedge the firm&#8217;s overall credit exposure, which is our largest
risk overall, in a stressed credit environment.&#8221; He said the
bank now plans to scale back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are reducing that hedge,&#8221; Dimon said. &#8220;The portfolio
has proven to be riskier, more volatile and less effective as an
economic hedge than we thought.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Citigroup&#8217;s corporate office tries to hedge some
credit risks, those trades are small and linked to consumers&#8217;
financial health, said Shannon Bell, a spokeswoman for the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Citi has a small amount of straightforward economic
hedges managed at the corporate center to mitigate our credit
exposure, principally relating to consumer loans,&#8221; Bell said,
declining to provide a figure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wells Fargo, BofA &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo also shuns such bets, Mary Eshet, a company
spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Wells Fargo does not have a CIO function that employs
large-scale macroeconomic credit-derivative hedges,&#8221; she wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America CEO Brian T. Moynihan said yesterday at the
investment conference that while his company sometimes uses
credit-default swaps tied to individual companies, it doesn&#8217;t
hedge against broader macroeconomic risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t do the macro hedging from a corporate
perspective,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We obviously manage our interest-rate
risk every day.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn&#8217;t make Bank of America, Wells Fargo or Citigroup
risk-free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The scale of their transactions remains an important
issue,&#8221; said Eric Hilt, an associate professor of economics at
Wellesley College in Massachusetts. &#8220;A currency hedge could be
just as damaging and risky as a credit hedge if done on an
absurdly large scale.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank treasury departments are a &#8220;sleepy little world,&#8221;
and aggressive risk-taking should be left to the trading
division, said Thomas Obermaier, a former Citigroup risk officer
who&#8217;s now CEO of Regulatory DataCorp Inc., a consulting firm
based in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. JPMorgan is a client and
owns a stake in the company, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This was clearly a treasury department designed to
maximize profit as much as trying to manage the portfolio, and
they got burned,&#8221; Obermaier said. &#8220;They can eat a $3 billion
loss. But you shouldn&#8217;t eat a $3 billion loss from treasury
trading.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) increased bets
on credit derivatives on investment-grade debt eightfold in the
first quarter, the period when the bank says it built trading
positions that have produced at least $2 billion of losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had sold $83.6 billion more of the derivatives
than it bought as of March 31, according to a Federal Reserve
report dated May 17. That compares with a $10.7 billion
difference as of Dec. 31, according to an earlier report. The
reports don&#8217;t provide details on specific trades or bank units
that contributed to the positions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest report provides a glimpse of New York-based
JPMorgan&#8217;s total derivatives-trading at the end of March, more
than a month before the bank disclosed the trading loss. Reuters
reported on the Fed data earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the bank had a $101.3 billion position on derivatives
expiring more than five years from now, it had a negative $53.8
billion position on derivatives maturing within one year,
according to the latest Fed report. JPMorgan had a $35.1 billion
position in derivatives maturing between one and five years as
of March 31. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s plan to
introduce an exchange-traded fund linked to copper will
&#8220;severely disrupt&#8221; the market, a group of industrial copper
users told the Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funds backed by copper would leave less of the metal
available for manufacturers, creating shortages and driving up
prices, according to a letter filed to securities regulator by
Vandenberg  Feliu, a New York-based law firm representing a
major copper-merchant company and several copper fabricators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ETFs trade like stocks, giving investors access to
commodities such as copper without taking physical delivery.
NYSE Arca Inc., the electronic platform of NYSE Euronext, filed
with the SEC to list and trade JPM XF Physical Copper Trust,
according to an April 2 document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s offering initially calls for the removal from
the market of as much as 61,800 metric tons of copper, or the
withdrawal of more than 30 percent of the supplies available for
immediate delivery worldwide, the merchants group said in its
letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPM&#8217;s offering will therefore result in a substantial
artificially-induced rise in near-term copper prices on the
London Metal Exchange, which will severely disrupt the world
market for the trading of such copper,&#8221; the group said in the
letter, dated May 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, BlackRock Inc. (BLK) and ETF Securities Ltd. said in
2010 they planned to start exchange-traded funds for industrial
metals. ETF Securities started the first exchange-traded
products backed by copper, nickel and tin in London in December
2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper holdings in ETF Securities&#8217; exchange-traded product
were 3,426.83 metric tons as of May 23, compared with 225,700
tons in stockpiles monitored by the London Metal Exchange.
Copper for delivery in three months fell 2.7 percent to $7,531 a
ton today, and has dropped 10 percent this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Times reported the copper group&#8217;s letter to
the SEC earlier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s $2 billion
trading loss shows regulators need to focus on ensuring banks
have enough capital relative to their risks, rather than trying
to ban proprietary trading, Sallie Krawcheck wrote in a
Financial Times op-ed article. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s often impossible to distinguish between proprietary
trading, services for clients and hedging, said Krawcheck,
former head of Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s wealth-management
division. Regulators should instead work to measure how much
risk banks have and on improving inadequate risk measurements,
in order to guarantee lenders have the right amount of capital,
she wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank regulators shouldn&#8217;t allow any activities that are too
complex for their risk models or stress tests to assess,
Krawcheck said. They also need to complete new regulations on
credit-rating companies, which could then act as &#8220;an unbiased
partner in assessing bank risk,&#8221; she added. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS), JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and other underwriters along with
Facebook Inc. (FB) were sued by investors who claimed they were
misled in the purchase of the social network firm&#8217;s stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs, who are seeking to proceed on behalf of a
class of Facebook investors, said the company and the banks
didn&#8217;t disclose lower revenue estimates before the share sale.
The members of the proposed class have lost more than $2.5
billion since the initial public offering last week, according
to a complaint filed today in Manhattan federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The true facts at the time of the IPO were that Facebook
was then experiencing a severe and pronounced reduction in
revenue growth,&#8221; the plaintiffs said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also sued were units of Bank of America Corp. and Barclays
Plc (BARC), as well as Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg
and Chief Financial Officer David Ebersman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook went public at $38 a share and plunged 19 percent
over two days. Facebook rose 3.2 percent, or $1, to $32 at 4:22
p.m. New York time in Nasdaq trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the lawsuit is without merit,&#8221; Andrew Noyes,
a spokesman for Menlo Park, California-based Facebook, said in
an e-mail. He said the company would fight the claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pen Pendleton, Michael DuVally and Mark Lane, spokesmen for
New York-based Morgan Stanley, New York-based Goldman Sachs and
London-based Barclays, respectively, declined to comment on the
lawsuit. Representatives of New York-based JPMorgan and
Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America didn&#8217;t
immediately return calls for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Revenue Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint states that Facebook&#8217;s revenue growth is
declining because its greatest expansion is coming from users of
mobile devices rather than personal computers. The company
hasn&#8217;t shown advertisements to people who log on through mobile
applications, according to the complaint. Facebook booked 85
percent of its revenue from advertising in 2011, according to
the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks named in the lawsuit reduced their estimates for
Facebook for the second quarter and full year of 2012 and didn&#8217;t
inform potential investors in presentations before the IPO,
according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The underwriters took down their earnings estimates
dramatically during the road show and only told a select group
of investors,&#8221; Samuel Rudman, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said
today in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Difficult Time &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs may have a difficult time proving the case
if it&#8217;s based on the presentation made to potential investors,
according to a securities lawyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s going to depend on who knew what when,&#8221; Jeremy
Garvey of Buchanan Ingersoll  Rooney in Pittsburgh said in a
phone interview. &#8220;The real question is, based on the final
prospectus, were the statements complete and correct?&#8221; Garvey
said. &#8220;If they have enough cautionary language in the
prospectus, they do have a bit of a disclaimer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Facebook investor sued Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. yesterday in
the same court, saying the exchange &#8220;badly mishandled&#8221; trades
in Facebook stock, which resulted in delays and a failure to
complete customer orders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That investor is also seeking class-action status for the
lawsuit on behalf of investors who lost money because their buy,
sell and cancellation orders weren&#8217;t properly processed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has said it
will review the first day of trading in Facebook shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underwriter case is Brian Roffe Profit Sharing Plan v.
Facebook, 12-04081, and the Nasdaq case is Goldberg v. Nasdaq
OMX Group Inc., 12-cv-04054, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Heidi Przybyla and William McQuillen" date="May 23, 2012 11:20 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-23/jpmorgan-joins-mf-global-in-lobbying-wins-that-backfire.html"><headline>JPMorgan Joins MF Global in Lobbying Wins That Backfire</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;MF Global Holdings Ltd. argued in a
December 2010 letter to regulators that futures brokers didn&#8217;t
need tighter restrictions on how they invest client funds. Ten
months later, as MF Global filed for bankruptcy, about $1.6
billion in customer accounts was missing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within weeks, U.S. derivatives regulators approved a
measure, dubbed the &#8220;MF rule,&#8221; designed to limit the kinds of
transactions firms could make using client funds. The rule had
been on the regulatory backburner as lobbyists sought to stall
or alter new curbs proposed after the 2008 financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s recent $2 billion loss,
MF Global&#8217;s case demonstrates that an army of Washington
lobbyists can sometimes succeed in rolling back or delaying U.S.
rules and regulations to the detriment of investors and
depositors, with rippling effects on the broader economy. Also,
their actions can backfire on the businesses that hired them in
the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a classic example of how industry claims to know
better than the bothersome bureaucrats in Washington,&#8221; said
Nancy Watzman, a consultant for the Sunlight Foundation, a
Washington-based group that advocates open government records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group documented nine meetings between MF Global
officials and staff from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission about the financial overhaul. The meetings focused on
such topics as money market mutual funds and provisions for
compiling information from various accounts, according to the
foundation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;An Embarrassment&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The paper trail companies have left pleading their cases
becomes an embarrassment,&#8221; Watzman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s loss follows lobbying by its chief executive,
Jamie Dimon, to weaken the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul,
which he has referred to as &#8220;Dodd Frankenstein.&#8221; Dimon&#8217;s
criticism of regulatory efforts may come back to haunt him and
the firm as lawmakers in Washington are pointing to the $2
billion loss as evidence that tougher regulation is needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both examples illustrate former Federal Reserve Chairman
Paul Volcker&#8217;s comment to reporters following a May 9 Senate
hearing that there&#8217;s &#8220;no question&#8221; that lobbying from banks
contributed to the complexity of the initial 298-page Dodd-Frank
proposal, including many rules that have been delayed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I could give you stories all day about lobbyists making
things more complicated because they may do it for reasons they
want to disrupt the whole process,&#8221; Volcker said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Intent&#8217; of Volcker Rule &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokeswoman Jennifer Zuccarelli declined to
comment, referring to Dimon&#8217;s March 30 annual letter to
shareholders in which he said he didn&#8217;t &#8220;disagree with the
intent of the Volcker rule.&#8221; At the same time, he was critical
of the financial regulatory overhaul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As a result of Dodd-Frank, we now have multiple
regulatory agencies with overlapping rules and oversight
responsibilities,&#8221; Dimon said in the letter. &#8220;We now have
allowed regulation to become politicized, which we believe will
likely lead to some bad outcomes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan employs 12 lobbyists and spent $7.6 million on
lobbying in 2011, according to the Center for Responsive
Politics in Washington, which tracks spending on Lobbying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lobbying topics included patent reform and helping
refinance Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac-held mortgages, according
to the group. Commercial banks spent a combined $61.8 million in
that period, employing 456 lobbyists, compared with the steel
industry&#8217;s 107 lobbyists and the airline industry&#8217;s 198 paid
representatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Secure, Profitable&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon S. Corzine, the former New Jersey governor and U.S.
senator, was MF Global&#8217;s chairman and chief executive officer.
Executive Vice President Laurie Ferber said in the Dec. 2, 2010,
letter to the U.S. derivatives regulator that it would be
&#8220;unnecessary&#8221; to block futures firms from investing funds from
customer segregated accounts. The letter said such restrictions
would &#8220;eliminate a liquid, secure, profitable and necessary
category of investment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, delayed the rule after a lobbying push by MF Global
and another firm, Newedge USA LLC, saying the agency needed more
time to assess the proposal. MF Global, the first Wall Street
firm to fail since the Dodd-Frank Act became law in July 2010,
filed for bankruptcy protection Oct. 31 after making wrong-way
bets on European sovereign debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Time of Stress&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corzine, who resigned on Nov. 4, later gave testimony that
endorsed Gensler&#8217;s assessment that the new rule would help
protect client funds held by futures firms. &#8220;At a time of
stress, his arguments may be much stronger,&#8221; Corzine said Dec.
8 before the House Agriculture Committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corzine said he was &#8220;more in support of&#8221; the CFTC&#8217;s
recommendations for tighter controls. He said he thought &#8220;they
should be modified a bit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diana DeSocio, an MF Global spokeswoman, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was hardly the first time high-powered Washington
lobbyists, who often are former lawmakers or government
officials, succeeded in forestalling rules and regulations or
helped broker a policy that backfired on their clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America,
the industry&#8217;s lobbying group, supported President Barack Obama&#8217;s health care proposal after the group&#8217;s then-Chief
Executive Billy Tauzin negotiated agreements with the White
House. The group agreed to $80 billion in discounts and rebates
while some provisions it opposed were dropped from the
legislation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Drug Imports &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PhRMA also sought for the administration to block the
importation of less expensive drugs because of safety concerns.
&#8220;They and everybody else was hoping that by being cooperative
they could negotiate certain specifics that would be a little
more beneficial to them,&#8221; said Joseph Antos, a health care and
retirement fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a
Washington group that favors free enterprise and smaller
government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then John Castellani, PhRMA&#8217;s current chief
executive, has said Obama&#8217;s proposals cutting billions of
dollars from Medicare and Medicaid spending on drugs would hurt
his groups. Taking more money from drug companies would result
in lost jobs and fewer cures, Castellani said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I see our critics and their one-dimensional focus on
costs, and I say: &#8216;How dare they?&#8217;&#8221; he said in a speech at the
group&#8217;s annual meeting last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Medicare Part D &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt Bennett, a spokesman for PhRMA, said the group
discourages any cuts to Medicare Part D, the drug program for
senior citizens. &#8220;This does not appear to be the right place to
cut,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pharmaceutical industry group has continued to lobby on
the issue, spending $240 million in 2011 and registering more
than 1,500 lobbyists, according to the Center for Responsive
Politics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another illustration of U.S. companies complaining of
Washington regulation is the Environmental Protection Agency and
the Obama administration&#8217;s efforts to promote clean air
policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lobbyists for coal producers such as Arch Coal Inc. and
Southern Co. opposed a measure in the U.S. House of
Representatives in 2009 that would have capped greenhouse gases
from power plants and provided credits that could be traded. The
measure also would have provided government investments in
technology to capture carbon dioxide from power plants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coal-Fired Plants &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the legislation&#8217;s failure, the EPA is now moving
to regulate power plant emissions in a way that may preclude the
construction of new coal-fired power plants, without providing
the credits or government investments. The EPA pointed to its
statement in March that the standard was a &#8220;common-sense step&#8221;
that would minimize carbon pollution and ensure progress toward
cleaner and more modern power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials at American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity,
a trade association representing the coal industry, didn&#8217;t
return messages seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Because these coal interests got their wish, there is
little investment in this so-called &#8216;clean coal&#8217; technology,&#8221;
said Daniel J. Weiss, director of climate change at the Center
for American Progress in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Instead, utilities are switching from dirty coal to
cleaner-burning, cheaper natural gas,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Coal and
utility companies have no one to blame but themselves for
helping strangle legislation that would have invested in &#8216;clean
coal.&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PAC Costs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of lobbying efforts gone awry go back decades and
aren&#8217;t limited to corporations, said Clyde Wilcox, a political
science professor at Georgetown University in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1971, with robust membership and plenty of cash to
invest, labor unions backed the Federal Election Campaign Act,
which allowed corporations and unions to pay the administrative
costs of political action committees. At the time, companies
were barred from making direct political donations and unions
were more active with PACs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unions assumed they would have the upper hand, Wilcox said.
Since then, their financial resources and membership have
dwindled and they&#8217;ve been outspent by companies, with pro-business PACs outnumbering union PACs by more than six-to-one,
Wilcox said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Almost immediately, the Chamber of Commerce and National
Association of Manufacturers encouraged companies to organize
PACs,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Within two years, the unions regretted it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walker, who left JPMorgan in 2001 after 22 years at the

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank, has hired former U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission enforcement chief William McLucas to help respond to
regulatory probes of the firm&#8217;s $2 billion trading loss,
according to two people with knowledge of the assignment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lender&#8217;s May 10 announcement of the &#8220;self-inflicted&#8221;
loss spurred reviews by the SEC, Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and
Federal Bureau of Investigation. JPMorgan has said the losses
may increase. Kristin Lemkau, a company spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t have
an immediate comment on the hiring. The people requested
anonymity because the appointment hasn&#8217;t been made public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McLucas, 61, a Washington-based partner at law firm Wilmer
Cutler Pickering Hale  Dorr LLP, led the SEC&#8217;s enforcement
division from 1989 to 1998. He didn&#8217;t reply to a phone call and
e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DTCC Plans Study on Faster Settlement for U.S. Securities &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Depository Trust  Clearing Corp. is commissioning a
study on whether the U.S. securities industry should cut the
time it takes to process transactions, a shift that may reduce
risk and compel brokers and asset managers to spend more on
further updating their systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based company that handles and guarantees
trades in U.S. stocks, corporate bonds and municipal securities
hired the Boston Consulting Group Inc. to assess the costs and
benefits of settling trades in fewer than three days, the
current standard, Elena Staloff, a vice president at DTCC, said
in a phone interview. A shorter cycle would mean firms could
post less capital to the clearing fund run by DTCC subsidiary
National Securities Clearing Corp. to cover a defaulting
broker&#8217;s obligations and pay less to meet the organization&#8217;s
liquidity needs to handle a problem, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2000 industry report about completing transactions in a
day said the one-time cost of moving to a so-called T+1
settlement would be $8 billion for the securities industry and
could be implemented within four years. The savings would be
$2.7 billion annually, the study found. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;More Executives Choosing to Fight the SEC in Post-Crisis Suits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, long known for
settling enforcement actions without having to prove its case in
court, is struggling to cope with a surge in the number of
executives and companies willing to go to trial to defend
themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC&#8217;s office in Washington is actively litigating about
90 cases, up more than 50 percent in the past year, Matthew
Martens, the SEC&#8217;s chief litigation counsel, said in an
interview. At the same time, Martens&#8217;s trial unit staff has
stayed relatively flat at about 36. Martens, who recently added
three more lawyers to his group and is looking to hire more,
said it&#8217;s critical that his unit present a credible threat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wave of litigation has two main sources: more complex
cases stemming from the 2008 financial crisis and a related
increase in lawsuits filed against individual executives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collapse of the housing market and resulting financial
turmoil involved complex securities for which there was little
legal precedent. In addition, the agency has brought more
financial crisis lawsuits against executives -- more than 50 so
far -- and individuals are often inclined to fight claims that
could damage or end their careers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prolonged courtroom battles could sap resources from the
SEC, which has said funding gaps have already diminished its
ability to regulate securities markets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Citigroup to Pay $3.5 Million Over Faulty Subprime RMBS Data &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C), the third-biggest U.S. bank, agreed to pay
$3.5 million to resolve regulatory claims that it gave investors
inaccurate data for subprime mortgage-backed securities as the
housing market collapsed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank posted incorrect information for three residential
mortgage-backed securities, or RMBS, from January 2006 through
October 2007, and it remained on Citigroup&#8217;s website until this
month, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority said
yesterday in a statement. The firm failed to correct the data
even after the errors were brought to its attention, said Finra,
the brokerage industry&#8217;s self-regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Vikram Pandit is dealing with
mounting costs from Citigroup&#8217;s conduct in the U.S. mortgage
market. The lender agreed to pay $158.3 million in February
after regulators alleged the firm had falsely declared some
loans fit for a federal insurance program. The bank must also
pay $2.2 billion as part of a $25 billion, 49-state settlement
between attorneys general and the biggest mortgage lenders,
after a nationwide probe into foreclosure practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RMBS issuers are required to disclose historical
performance data for securities similar to those they are
offering. That information is critical for investors to assess
whether future returns may be disrupted by mortgage holders
failing to make loan payments, Finra said in its statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brokerage lacked procedures to verify the pricing of
the securities and didn&#8217;t sufficiently document steps taken to
assess whether the traders&#8217; prices were reasonable, Finra said.
The unit also failed to keep proper records following margin
calls that prompted revisions in the prices, according to the
Washington-based regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup settled the claims without admitting or denying
wrongdoing, Finra said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased to put this matter behind us,&#8221; Danielle
Romero-Apsilos, a spokeswoman for New York-based Citigroup, said
in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fidelity&#8217;s Stairs Gets Securities Dealing Ban in Hong Kong &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Fidelity Management  Research Co. portfolio manager
George Stairs was banned from dealing securities in Hong Kong
for two years for selling Chaoda Modern Agriculture Holdings
Ltd. (682) shares using inside information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong Market Misconduct Tribunal, which announced
the ban today, didn&#8217;t penalize Stairs for the losses he avoided
because the insider trading was executed on behalf of his funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stairs had argued that he didn&#8217;t agree to restrict himself
from trading in exchange for material non-public information,
and that he thought the information was already public
knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three-member Hong Kong tribunal, led by High Court
Judge Michael Lunn, ruled on April 26 that Stairs received non-public information in June 2009 about a share placement and sold
down his Chaoda holdings before the placement was announced,
according to Hong Kong&#8217;s government. He netted HK$1.98 million
($255,000) for his funds by selling Chaoda shares ahead of the
announcement. No wrongdoing was found on the part of Fidelity
and the firm isn&#8217;t liable to any disgorgement orders from Hong
Kong authorities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vincent Loporchio, a Boston-based spokesman for Fidelity,
said on May 20 the company respectfully disagrees with the Hong
Kong tribunal&#8217;s conclusions regarding Stairs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He did not knowingly trade on non-public price sensitive
information,&#8221; Loporchio said in an e-mail at the time.
&#8220;Fidelity conducted a thorough internal review of this matter
consistent with its strong protocols.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stairs remains an employee and is no longer managing assets
on behalf of funds or clients, Loporchio said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Google Meets French Regulator on Review of Privacy Policy Change &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) will meet with France&#8217;s data-protection
authority today to discuss an inquiry into whether revised
privacy policies for users of the world&#8217;s largest Web-search
provider violate European rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Commission for Computing and Civil Liberties,
known by its French acronym as CNIL, asked to discuss Google&#8217;s
responses to questions it sent in March covering topics from the
Android operating system to how information is collected with
cookies, a spokeswoman for the Paris-based agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CNIL is acting on behalf of other European regulators who
sought the review after Google announced changes to its privacy
rules. The Mountain View, California-based company defied two
CNIL requests to halt changes while it determined whether
European standards were met. Google implemented it as planned on
March 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change &#8220;is an important part of our layered approach
to providing users with clear and comprehensive information
about how we use data, and it is supplemented by additional
privacy information to our users,&#8221; Google said in an e-mailed
statement before today&#8217;s meeting. &#8220;We are confident that our
privacy notices respect the requirements of European data

&lt;h2&gt;U.K. Regulator Takes Another Look at Swap Sales to SMEs, FT Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K.&#8217;s Financial Service Authority is making a second
review of sales of interest-rate swaps to small and mid-size
businesses, after an earlier probe found few problems, the
Financial Times said, citing a letter published by FSA Chairman
Adair Turner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reviewing a &#8220;small number of complaints&#8221; from small
businesses about interest-rate swaps in 2010 and 2011, and
concluding that there were no &#8220;widespread underlying
problems,&#8221; the FSA is doing more now to examine how the
products are designed and sold, Turner said, according to the
newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The action follows a request from Parliament&#8217;s Treasury
Select Committee for further investigation, the FT said, citing
committee Chairman Andrew Tyrie. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Yahoo Executive, Fund Manager Plead Guilty to Insider Trading &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) executive and a former mutual fund
manager at a unit of Ameriprise Financial Inc. (AMP) pleaded guilty to
insider trading and resolved civil complaints by federal
securities regulators, the U.S. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert W. Kwok, Yahoo&#8217;s senior director of business
management, gave illegal tips to Reema D. Shah, a portfolio
manager at the Ameriprise unit, RiverSource Investments LLC,
about Yahoo&#8217;s quarterly earnings and potential transactions with
outside companies, Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for Manhattan,
said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kwok, 36, of Danville, California, and Shah, 40, of Menlo
Park, California, both pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit
securities fraud, according to the statement. Kwok&#8217;s sentencing
is scheduled for Sept. 18 and Shah&#8217;s is set for May 24, Bharara
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither Kwok nor Shah could be reached at their home phone
numbers for comment. Laura Birger, a lawyer representing Kwok,
and Ted Cassman, an attorney for Shah, didn&#8217;t immediately return
calls seeking comment on the pleas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are U.S. v. Shah and U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission v. Shah, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SEC Sues Two Florida Men Over Claims They Fueled Rothstein Fraud &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued two
Florida men over claims they fraudulently raised more than $157
million to fuel a Ponzi scheme that collapsed in October 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George Levin and Frank Preve used money from 173 investors
to purchase phony legal settlements from Florida attorney Scott
Rothstein, who is serving a 50-year prison sentence for running
the fraud, the SEC said yesterday in a statement. Levin and
Preve misrepresented to investors that they had procedures in
place to protect the funds, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least eight people have pleaded guilty to helping
Rothstein, who admitted in 2010 that he persuaded wealthy
investors to buy stakes in what he said were payouts from
settlements of sexual-harassment and workplace-discrimination
cases. The cases were fabricated, using forged documents and
fictitious plaintiffs and defendants, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a joint statement, attorneys for Levin and Preve said
their clients were &#8220;two of the biggest victims&#8221; of Rothstein&#8217;s
fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Levin and Mr. Preve have testified at length on
multiple occasions before the SEC and have provided many
thousands of pages of documents to the SEC to assist it in its
investigation,&#8221; according to the statement. &#8220;Their extensive
cooperation, and the detailed written submissions of counsel for
Mr. Levin and Mr. Preve, showed that Mr. Levin and Mr. Preve
were not involved in the Ponzi scheme and were deceived and
defrauded by Mr. Rothstein.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC is seeking disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and
unspecified financial penalties. The agency&#8217;s investigation is
continuing, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v.
Levin, 12-cv-21917, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
Florida (Miami). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special Section: Facebook IPO &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook Investor Sues Nasdaq Over &#8216;Mishandled&#8217; Stock Offering &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Facebook Inc. (FB) investor said in a lawsuit that Nasdaq OMX
Group Inc. (NDAQ) &#8220;badly mishandled&#8221; Facebook&#8217;s initial public
offering, delaying trading and failing to cancel orders when
requested by customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phillip Goldberg, a Maryland investor, said in a complaint
filed yesterday in Manhattan federal court that he tried to both
order and cancel requests for Facebook shares through an online
Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW) account the morning after the May 17 IPO.
He is seeking to represent a class of investors who lost money
because their buy, sell or cancellation orders for Facebook
stock weren&#8217;t properly processed, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Orders placed by investors seeking to purchase Facebook
shares during the first trading day often took hours to
execute,&#8221; Goldberg said in the complaint. &#8220;In the meantime,
the investors seeking to purchase those shares had no idea if
their trades had executed, and, accordingly, had no idea if they
owned Facebook shares at all.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldberg, who claims Nasdaq acted negligently, is seeking
unspecified damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Madden, a spokesman for Nasdaq, didn&#8217;t return a call
yesterday seeking comment on the suit. Ashley Zandy, a
spokeswoman for Facebook, the world&#8217;s biggest social network,
declined to comment on the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also yesterday, Facebook settled a lawsuit &#8220;in principle&#8221;
over claims that it used information supplied by users to
advertise products without their consent. Terms of the agreement
weren&#8217;t disclosed in a filing in federal court in San Jose,
California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook was accused in the complaint of appropriating the
names, photographs and identities of users for advertising
endorsements as part of a &#8220;misleading advertising scheme,&#8221;
according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Noyes, a spokesman for Menlo Park, California-based
Facebook, declined to comment on the settlement. Jonathan Davis,
a lawyer with the San Francisco-based Arns Law Firm representing
the plaintiffs, didn&#8217;t immediately return a call seeking
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investor case is Goldberg v. Nasdaq OMX Group Inc., 12-CV-04054, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finra Chief Says Morgan Stanley May Face Probe Over Facebook IPO &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) could face regulatory scrutiny over claims
that an analyst shared negative news about Facebook Inc. with
institutional investors before that firm&#8217;s initial public
offering last week, according to the head of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If true, the allegations are a matter of regulatory
concern&#8221; to the industry-funded brokerage watchdog and the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, Finra Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Richard Ketchum said today in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ketchum commented in response to a news report that an
analyst for Morgan Stanley, lead underwriter for the IPO,
lowered a Facebook revenue forecast after the social-networking
company said growth in mobile products could hurt its business.
Such a move could come under scrutiny from regulators if the
warning was only provided to institutional investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finra&#8217;s chief didn&#8217;t say whether his Washington-based
agency is investigating Morgan Stanley. John Nester, a spokesman
for the SEC, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Facebook Tumble Means Morgan Stanley Gets Blame for Flop &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After one of the most anticipated initial public offerings
in history, Facebook Inc.&#8217;s 11 percent drop May 21 and further
decline yesterday prompted investors to fault everything from
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s role as lead underwriter, to the Nasdaq Stock
Market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the most heat is Morgan Stanley, said Michael
Mullaney, chief investment officer at Fiduciary Trust in Boston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more, click here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, the lead underwriter, released a statement
defending its handling of the May 17 IPO after the Massachusetts
security division yesterday subpoenaed the investment bank over
its communications with clients. The U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission and the brokerage industry&#8217;s watchdog both
said they may review the offering, and a buyer of Facebook stock
sued Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. over glitches in opening-day trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anticipation that preceded history&#8217;s biggest technology
IPO has been replaced by investor ire, including about whether
the offer was priced too high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook increased the number of shares being sold in the
IPO by 25 percent last week to 421.2 million and raised its
asking price to a range of $34 to $38 from $28 to $35. The
shares closed yesterday at $31 in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Nasdaq CEO Blames Software for Delayed Facebook IPO Trading &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nasdaq OMX Group Inc., under scrutiny after shares of
Facebook Inc. were hit by delays and mishandled orders on its
first day, blamed &#8220;poor design&#8221; in the software it uses for
driving auctions in initial public offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer systems used to establish the opening price were
overwhelmed by order cancellations and updates, Nasdaq Chief
Executive Officer Robert Greifeld, 54, said in a conference call
with reporters. Nasdaq&#8217;s systems fell into a &#8220;loop&#8221; that kept
the second-largest U.S. stock venue operator from opening the
shares on time following the $16 billion deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the errors were resolved and Facebook completed its
offering, the day was another setback for equity exchanges
trying to erase the memory of the botched IPO in March by Bats
Global Markets Inc., another bourse owner. Nasdaq&#8217;s issues
contributed to disappointment among investors as Facebook&#8217;s
stock plunged as much as 14 percent May 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it will
review the trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a lot of reason to have confidence in our
markets and the integrity of how they operate, but there are
issues we need to look at specifically with regard to
Facebook,&#8221; SEC Chairwoman Mary Schapiro told reporters in
Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Thaw, a spokesman for Menlo Park, California-based
Facebook, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Interviews &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gensler, Schapiro Testify About Derivatives Oversight &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Gary Gensler
and Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro
testified before the Senate Banking Committee in Washington
about issues related to derivative swaps and oversight of the
derivatives market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The types of derivative swaps said to have led to a loss of
at least $2 billion at JPMorgan Chase  Co. may be the first for
which the CFTC would require guarantees by clearinghouses under
the Dodd-Frank Act, according to Gensler. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the video, click here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shelby Not Sure Dodd-Frank Would Prevent JPMorgan Loss &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Senator Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican, talked
about the prospects for financial regulation following the $2
billion trading loss by JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shelby, who spoke to Megan Hughes on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s
&#8220;Bottom Line,&#8221; also discussed the outlook for testimony by
Jamie Dimon, chief executive officer of JPMorgan, before the
Senate Banking Committee next month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will next month hear
the result of its European Union court challenge over an 899
million-euro ($1.14 billion) penalty for failing to comply
with an antitrust decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU&#8217;s General Court will rule June 27 on Microsoft&#8217;s
appeal of fines for breaching an earlier order by overcharging
rivals for licenses they needed to connect products to Windows
computers, according to a filing on the court&#8217;s website today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is the only company in more than 50 years of EU
competition policy to be penalized for failing to comply with an
order. The case is the last remnant of years of disputes with
the European Commission that resulted in fines totaling 1.68
billion euros. Microsoft agreed in 2009 to settle an antitrust
clash over Internet browsers in a bid to repair the company&#8217;s
uneasy relationship with the EU regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission, the EU&#8217;s antitrust authority, imposed the
fine as a so-called periodic penalty payment on Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft for failing to comply with a 2004
antitrust order. Under the initial decision, Microsoft was
fined 497 million euros and ordered to provide data to
competitors to allow servers to connect to computers using its
Windows operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest software company told judges at an
appeal hearing last year that the 2008 fine was &#8220;especially
unfair&#8221; because the regulator failed to give it sufficient
guidance to avoid the fine. The court should annul the
&#8220;unnecessary, unlawful and totally disproportionate penalty,&#8221;
Jean-Francois Bellis, a Microsoft lawyer, told the court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robin Koch, a spokesman for Microsoft in Brussels, today
declined to comment before the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court&#8217;s ruling can be appealed to the EU&#8217;s highest
tribunal, the European Court of Justice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is T-167/08, Microsoft v. European Commission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG), owner of the world&#8217;s
most popular Internet search engine, said a new report shows
that Microsoft (MSFT) Corp. makes the most requests among copyright
owners to remove content from Google&#8217;s search service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, or others on its behalf, has requested more than
2.5 million Web pages, or URLs, be removed because of copyright
infringement, while Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)&#8217;s NBCUniversal was No. 2 with
almost 1 million, according to data released by Google that
measured all requests going back to 2011. Member companies of
the Recording Industry Association of America, including EMI
Music North America, was No. 3 with more than 400,000 requests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re providing information about who sends us copyright
removal notices, how often, on behalf of which copyright owners
and for which websites,&#8221; said Fred von Lohmann, Google&#8217;s senior
copyright counsel, in a blog post. &#8220;As policy makers and
Internet users around the world consider the pros and cons of
different proposals to address the problem of online copyright
infringement, we hope this data will contribute to the
discussion.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google is under scrutiny from companies and governments
around the world over what type of content it shows on its

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s 2011
executive compensation plan, which awarded Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein $12.4 million, won approval from more
than 94 percent of shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tally was announced by General Counsel Gregory K. Palm
at the company&#8217;s annual shareholder meeting today in Jersey
City, New Jersey. The New York-based company won more support in
the non-binding advisory vote than last year, when 73 percent of
shareholders approved the awards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All 10 board members at Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest
U.S. bank by assets, were re-elected by a majority of
shareholders, Palm said. James A. Johnson, the former Fannie Mae (FNMA)
CEO who is the longest-serving director and the chairman of the
bank&#8217;s compensation committee, had been publicly opposed by
shareholder Ruane, Cunniff  Goldfarb Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support for Johnson fell to 83.6 percent from 95.5 percent
last year, according to results published in a company filing
after the meeting. About 49 million votes were cast against
Johnson&#8217;s re-election, the most of any board member and four
times as many as were cast against Blankfein, who was reelected
with 96.2 percent of the vote, the results showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholders rejected three proposals offered at the
meeting by investors, according to Palm. All three had been
opposed by the company&#8217;s board of directors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Executive&#8217;s Holdings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would have provided shareholders with so-called
cumulative voting, which permits investors to withhold votes
from certain director nominees in order to cast multiple ballots
for others. It received approval from 24 percent of voters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another that would have required the bank&#8217;s named executive
officers to retain at least 75 percent of their stock for at
least three years after leaving the firm was approved by 17
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third would have required the company to prepare an
annual report disclosing its direct and indirect lobbying
expenditures, and was approved by 7 percent of the voters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar proposals failed at last year&#8217;s annual meeting,
with cumulative voting receiving 25.6 percent of the vote and a
proposal requiring stock retention winning 20.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distortions in credit-default swaps
prices fueled by JPMorgan Chase  Co. trader Bruno Iksil are
pushing investors to exchange-traded funds to make bearish bets
on junk bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traders sold short an unprecedented 6.86 million shares of
BlackRock Inc.&#8217;s $15.1 billion iShares iBoxx High Yield
Corporate Bond Fund at the end of April, about 4 percent of the
biggest junk-bond ETF&#8217;s outstanding shares, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That&#8217;s up more than three-fold from the
low this year in mid-February. About 12.6 million shares of
State Street&#8217;s junk-bond ETF, the second-largest, were sold
short, up from 7.78 million shares in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors are seeking a more effective hedge against
falling debt prices as the cost to protect against declines
using swaps exceeded relative yields on the debt by the most in
three years, Barclays Plc data show. Market participants have
blamed trades by Iksil for disrupting prices in the credit-swaps
market, typically investors&#8217; first choice for hedging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The ETFs were able to maintain a closer correlation to
the cash index&#8221; than swaps, UBS AG strategists led by George Bory said in a May 22 report. &#8220;It is quite likely that this
came about as a result of recently publicized outsized trades
in&#8221; credit-swaps indexes, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fast and Discreet &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed-income ETFs allow anyone from banks to retirees fast
and discreet access to speculative-grade bonds without directly
owning them. Unlike mutual funds, whose shares are priced once
daily, ETFs are listed on exchanges and are bought and sold like
stocks. As trading has increased in the funds, the cost to
borrow shares in order to sell them short has dropped, the UBS
analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The volume of short selling in the three-biggest junk-bond
ETFs has increased 92 percent since the beginning of March,
according to the UBS analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the CDS market were functioning normally, then that
would be the easiest way&#8221; to hedge, said Sabur Moini, a money
manager who helps oversee about $2.5 billion of high-yield
assets at Los Angeles-based Payden  Rygel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in credit markets, United Technologies Corp. (UTX) is
planning a six-part, $10 billion debt offering to help finance
its $16.5 billion acquisition of Goodrich Corp. The market for
corporate borrowing via commercial paper increased to more than
$1 trillion outstanding for the first time this year, and a
gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk fell for a second day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Swap Spreads Fall &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. two-year interest-rate swap spread, a measure of
debt market stress, fell 1.5 basis point to 33.25 basis points
as of 11:45 a.m. in New York. The gauge, which reached a four-month high of 39.13 on May 15, narrows when investors favor
assets such as corporate bonds and widens when they seek the
perceived safety of government securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, dropped 0.9
basis point to a mid-price of 117.4, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The index has dropped from a five-month
high of 123.4 on May 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In London, the Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies
with investment-grade ratings declined 6.4 to 174.5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indexes typically fall as investor confidence improves
and rise as it deteriorates. Credit-default swaps pay the buyer
face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the
value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000
annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;United Technologies Sale &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;United Technologies will offer floating-rate securities due
in 2013 and 2015, as well as three-, five-, 10- and 30-year
fixed-rate notes, the maker of Sikorsky helicopters and Pratt 
Whitney engines said in a regulatory filing. The offering, the
company&#8217;s first in more than two years, consists of $10 billion
of senior unsecured notes, Fitch Ratings said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aerospace and building-systems company will use
proceeds to help fund its acquisition of Charlotte, North
Carolina-based supplier Goodrich that is expected to close mid-year, Hartford, Connecticut-based United Technologies said in
the filing. Proceeds may also be used for general corporate
purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S. commercial paper
rose $14.9 billion to $1.009 trillion in the week ended
yesterday, the Federal Reserve said today on its website. That&#8217;s
the highest level since $1.03 trillion on Sept. 21, while the
fourth straight weekly increase is the longest streak since the
period ended Feb. 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ford Most Active &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds of Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford, the automaker
lifted to investment grade by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service this
week, were the most actively traded dollar-denominated corporate
securities by dealers, with 52 trades of $1 million or more as
of 11:32 a.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exchange-traded funds are luring bigger investors as they
account for a greater portion of the high-yield debt market.
ETFs have attracted $6.5 billion in 2012, accounting for 28
percent of all flows into the debt during the period, according
to JPMorgan analysts led by Peter Acciavatti in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-yield, high-risk, or junk bonds and leveraged loans
are graded below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s and lower than BBB- at Standard
 Poor&#8217;s and Fitch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three biggest U.S. junk-bond ETFs hold $25.6 billion of
debt, compared with $43.6 billion of all corporate securities
with maturities greater than a year held by the 21 primary
dealers authorized to trade directly with the Federal Reserve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ETFs Morph &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s morphed into more of an institutional tool,&#8221; said
Bonnie Baha, head of global developed credit at DoubleLine
Capital LP in Los Angeles, which oversees $34 billion. &#8220;The
whole idea of investing in a corporate bond is, &#8216;Are you going
to get your money back?&#8217; Now it&#8217;s not just, &#8216;Are you going to
get your money back?&#8217; but &#8216;Are you going to get your money
out?&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock&#8217;s fund has lost 2.5 percent this month, compared
with 2.1 percent loss on the iBoxx Liquid High Yield Index,
which it seeks to replicate, or a 0.4 percentage point
difference, Bloomberg-compiled data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short-selling accelerated as the gap between a benchmark
credit-default swaps index tied to junk bonds and relative
yields on the debt soared to 85 basis points last week, the
highest in three years, Barclays strategists said in a May 22
presentation to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Iksil Trades &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe part of this short position reflects large
scale institutional hedging by means of the ETFs rather than the
at the time heavily technically distorted CDX indices,&#8221; the UBS
analysts wrote, referring to trades by JPMorgan&#8217;s chief
investment office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News first reported April 5 that JPMorgan&#8217;s
Iksil, a trader in the bank&#8217;s chief investment office, had
amassed positions that were so large he was driving price moves
in the $10 trillion market for credit swaps indexes tied to
corporate creditworthiness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bets roiled price relationships that affected
instruments used to hedge hundreds of billions of dollars of
fixed-income holdings, market participants, who asked not to be
identified because they weren&#8217;t authorized to discuss the
activity, said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the positions included bearish bets on high-yield
bonds, the market participants said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Closer Correlation&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon hosted a
conference call May 10 to disclose what he called &#8220;egregious&#8221;
and &#8220;self-inflicted&#8221; mistakes in the chief investment office,
which manages a $381.7 billion portfolio for the biggest U.S.
bank by assets. The loss occurred in London under multiple
traders, according to an executive at the bank, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aware of the market-distorting trades, dealers &#8220;relied
instead on the ETFs to more accurately hedge trading books as
the ETFs were able to maintain a closer correlation to the cash
index,&#8221; the UBS strategists said in the note this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-yield bonds in the U.S. have dropped 1.34 percent this
month as concern mounts that Greece will exit from the euro.
That&#8217;s the biggest loss since November, Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors have been drawn to junk-bond ETFs as a way to
short the debt as ETF shares are exchanged in greater volumes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The bigger and more liquid it is, the easier to short,
the cheaper to short,&#8221; Payden  Rygel&#8217;s Moini said. &#8220;It&#8217;s
difficult to do it with high-yield cash bonds. In the cash
market it&#8217;s always been sort of difficult and expensive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silver Lake Partners LP and Partners
Group AG hired Royal Bank of Canada (RY), JPMorgan (JPM) Chase  Co., and
Natixis to arrange debt financing for the acquisition of Global
Blue, a travel-related tax-refund services provider. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silver Lake and Partners Group said today they agreed to
buy the Nyon, Switzerland-based company from Equistone Partners
Europe Ltd. for about 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In this challenging environment we were very fortunate to
work with RBC who led the financing effort, along with JPMorgan
and Natixis, to secure the debt for this investment,&#8221; Joe
Osnoss, a London-based managing director at Silver Lake, said in
an e-mail to Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acquisition loans will account for 3.5 times Global
Blue&#8217;s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization, or about 40 percent of the company&#8217;s value,
according to three people who declined to be identified because
the deal is private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman in New York for Silver Lake declined to
comment on the financing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equistone, which was spun off from Barclays Plc last year,
bought Global Blue in 2007 for 360 million euros. Since then,
the company has doubled its revenue and increased Ebitda to
about 97 million euros from about 35 million euros, according to
Equistone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) was sued by a
homeowner who accused the bank of forcing the holders of
mortgages it services to pay for &#8220;excessive amounts of flood
insurance coverage.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathew Scheetz, of Fort Collins, Colorado, sued the bank
yesterday in federal court in Manhattan. He is seeking to
represent a nationwide class of mortgage borrowers and asked for
unspecified damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit follows the announcement by New York state
regulators into rates for so-called force-placed insurance,
which is taken out on homes by banks or mortgage servicers when,
for example, a homeowner&#8217;s policy lapses or the bank decides the
borrower doesn&#8217;t have enough coverage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Scheetz v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, 12-cv-4113,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG), the largest Web search
provider, didn&#8217;t infringe Oracle Corp. (ORCL)&#8217;s patents in developing
Android software, a federal jury found in the second phase of an
intellectual property trial in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10-person jury ruled unanimously yesterday that neither
of the two patents at issue was infringed. Immediately after the
verdict was announced, the judge dismissed the jury from the
case and canceled the third phase of the trial over damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle, the largest maker of database software, alleged
Google stole two patents for the Java programming language when
it developed Android, which now runs on more than 300 million
smartphones. In the first phase of the trial, the same jury
found the search engine company infringed Oracle&#8217;s Java
copyrights while it couldn&#8217;t agree on whether the copying was
&#8220;fair use.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury verdict that Android doesn&#8217;t infringe Oracle&#8217;s
patents &#8220;was a victory not just for Google but the entire
Android ecosystem,&#8221; Catherine Lacavera, Google&#8217;s director of
litigation, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google and Oracle&#8217;s experts had estimated damages for both
patents at $3 million to $4 million if the jury found
infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Oracle presented overwhelming evidence at trial that
Google knew it would fragment and damage Java,&#8221; Deborah
Hellinger, a spokeswoman for Oracle, said in an e-mail after the
verdict. &#8220;We plan to continue to defend and uphold Java&#8217;s core
write once run anywhere principle and ensure it is protected for
the nine million Java developers and the community that depend
on Java compatibility.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge William Alsup, who presided over the
trial, said he may issue a ruling next on whether Oracle&#8217;s Java
application programming interfaces, software tools at the heart
of the case, can be copyrighted. A ruling that they aren&#8217;t would
be another blow to Oracle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alsup must also still rule on Oracle&#8217;s motion for a patent-infringement judgment in its favor based on the evidence and on
Mountain View, California-based Google&#8217;s request for a new trial
on whether it infringed Java copyrights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without any verdict on fair use of the copyrights, Redwood
City, California-based Oracle is prevented from seeking $1
billion in damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Oracle v. Google, 10-3561, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;OSU Helps Develop New Cut of Steak, Seeks Patent on Technology &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oklahoma State University, working together with an outside
agricultural consultant who styles himself as the &#8220;meat geek,&#8221;
and a Chicago chef, has discovered a new cut of beef and is
seeking a patent on the product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cut, known as the &#8220;Vegas Strip Steak,&#8221; is from a
section of a beef carcass that previously ended up as hamburger.
In a university statement, Jacob Nelson of the school&#8217;s Robert
M. Kerr Food  Agricultural Products Center, said that
previously the notion of finding a new cut of beef appeared to
be &#8220;an impossibility.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vegas Strip Steak &#8220;is the latest and perhaps last
steak to be found on the beef carcass, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partnering with the university is Antonio Mata of North
Richland, Texas-based Mata  Associates. He is a consultant with
a doctorate in agricultural biochemistry and nutrition who bills
himself as the &#8220;meat geek&#8221; on his website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third party is Richard Gresh, executive chef at David
Burke&#8217;s Primehouse restaurant in Chicago&#8217;s James hotel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a joint statement from the parties, the Vegas
Strip Steak is comparable to a New York strip steak, and has
&#8220;little connective tissue or visible fat.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology is available for licensing through the
Technology Development Center of the University of Oklahoma. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Alleged Use of Logo Wins Activist Group Twitter Suspension &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An activist group accused of using the logo of the London
2012 Olympic games without authorization had its account with
Twitter Inc. (TWTR)&#8217;s short-messaging service suspended, the U.K.&#8217;s
Guardian newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Francisco-based Twitter told the group its use of the
logo in one of its postings could have been confused with the
committee&#8217;s official postings, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group, known as &#8220;Space Highjackers&#8221; told the Guardian
it was engaging in &#8220;purely social commentary&#8221; and wasn&#8217;t
trying to sell any fake products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the committee said its takedown request was
motivated solely by its desire to protect its logo and not over
any concern with Space Highjackers&#8217; message, according to the
Guardian. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft CEO Says China Intellectual Property Protection &#8216;Weak&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), which is preparing to roll out its new
Windows operating system, sees intellectual property protection
in China as &#8220;still weak&#8221; making it difficult to sell
legitimate software, Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Ballmer is &#8220;super excited&#8221; about growth in the
China market, which is unique in being the largest for both
phones and personal computers and is the fastest growing, he
said in a speech at Peking University in Beijing May 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Ambassador to China Gary Locke last month said China&#8217;s
lack of protection for intellectual property rights is hampering
companies doing business in the country and that strengthening
enforcement needs to be a top priority. The country&#8217;s illegal
software market was worth almost $9 billion last year, versus a
legal market of less than $3 billion, according to the annual
report of the Business Software Alliance this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;China is a market that adopts technology, and yet China
is a market where intellectual property protection is still
weak,&#8221; Ballmer told more than 2,000 students. &#8220;In Microsoft&#8217;s
case we are fortunate we can sell our products outside of China.
For a Chinese developer, it&#8217;s probably tougher because your
domestic market is a tough one in which to really sell
software.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ballmer also met Vice Premier Wang Qishan May 22, Xinhua
News Agency said. Wang said provincial governments will be using
authorized software by the end of June and city and county
governments will be in compliance by the end of 2013, the
official news service reported yesterday. Central government
organs &#8220;accomplished this goal&#8221; last year, Xinhua said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft plans to challenge Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s dominance in
tablet computers with Windows 8, a new operating system version
designed to run touch-screen devices. The software is scheduled
to go on sale around October, people with knowledge of the
matter said in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ballmer predicted that next year the same audience will be
full of people carrying Windows phones. Windows 8 is almost like
a new operating system and a complete &#8220;reimagining&#8221; of the
Windows system to work on all devices from phones to tablets to
desktop computers, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ohio Considers Drilling Rules Opponents Say Favor Frackers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ohio House is preparing to vote on rules for natural-gas drillers that Republican Governor John Kasich calls among
the nation&#8217;s toughest, even as environmentalists say they let
companies decide which industrial chemicals stay secret. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House Public Utilities Committee was to vote yesterday
on a bill Kasich sought governing hydraulic fracturing, or
fracking, said Representative Peter Stautberg, the Republican
chairman of the committee. The measure, which could get a full
House vote today, would require disclosure of chemicals, water
sampling before drilling and tracking wastewater into disposal
wells. The Senate passed the bill May 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kasich, 60, said the rules will help Ohio profit from a
boom in fracking -- which involves injecting chemicals, water
and sand underground to free gas reserves -- while protecting
drinking water and the environment. Ohio has 72 horizontally
drilled fracking wells, and the state Natural Resources
Department projects that 2,250 will be drilled by the end of
2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It sets up the most important, strongest, clearest and
fairest regulations for hydraulic fracturing,&#8221; Kasich told
reporters in Columbus, Ohio, on May 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;States including Ohio, Pennsylvania and North Dakota are
confronting the costs and benefits of fracking and how to
regulate it. The industry says fracking is safe and allows
increased production; environmental groups say it can lead to
contamination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While groups including the Columbus-based Ohio
Environmental Council praised Kasich for seeking the law, they
said the provisions don&#8217;t go far enough and are calling for
changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill allows companies to shield chemicals as trade
secrets, allows them to delay disclosure for 60 days after a
well has been drilled, and places a &#8220;gag order&#8221; on doctors
against disclosing information about chemicals that may have
affected patients, said Thom Cmar, an attorney for the Natural
Resources Defense Council in Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measure also ensures that while companies can appeal
the denial of a state permit to drill for oil and gas, residents
can&#8217;t appeal permit approvals, according to the Ohio
Environmental Council in Columbus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK), Devon Energy Corp. (DVN) and Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM) are among companies drilling in Ohio&#8217;s Utica Shale rock
formation. Its development will support 65,680 jobs and add $4.9
billion to the state&#8217;s economic output in 2014, according to a
study released Feb. 28 by the Ohio Shale Coalition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABC Responds to Suit, Says &#8216;Big Brother&#8217; Not a Secret &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s ABC unit has responded in a court
filing to a trade-secrets case filed in connection with the
network&#8217;s proposed &#8220;Glass House&#8221; reality television program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBS Corp. (CBS)&#8217;s CBS Broadcasting unit sued ABC in federal court
in Los Angeles May 10, claiming that &#8220;Glass House&#8221; infringed
the copyrights and used misappropriated trade secrets belonging
the &#8220;Big Brother&#8221; reality program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint noted that at least 19 former producers and
staff members from &#8220;Big Brother&#8221; were working on &#8220;Glass
House,&#8221; which CBS claims is a &#8220;carbon copy&#8221; of its show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 21, ABC filed a statement in response to a CBS
request to seal parts of the court filing. The network said that
if and when CBS filed papers seeking a halt to the program, it
will show that what it allegedly stole isn&#8217;t trade secrets.
Those elements that CBS claims are proprietary and protectable
&#8220;are generally understood principles related to reality show
production,&#8221; ABC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the information about &#8220;Big Brother&#8221; is
&#8220;readily apparent from watching the television show, taking a
behind the scenes tour or reading about the show on the
Internet.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBS is represented by Blaine H. Evanson, Michael W. Seitz,
Scott A. Edelman and Theane Evangelis Kapur of Los Angeles-based
Gibson, Dunn  Crutcher LLP. ABC&#8217;s lawyers are Jonathan E.
Altman, Carolyn H. Luedtke, Glenn D. Pomerantz, and Peter E.
Gratzinger of Munger Tolles  Olson LLP, also of Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is CBS Broadcasting Inc. v. American Broadcasting
Companies, 2:12-cv-04073-GAF-JEM, U.S. District Court, Central
District of California (Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IC3 Warns Updating Software Through Hotel Connection Risky &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet Crime Complaint Center has issued a warning to
business travelers who use hotel Internet connections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The center, which is a partnership between the U.S. Federal
Bureau of Investigation and the National White Collar Crime
Center, said that some travelers&#8217; laptops are becoming infected
with malicious software that could potentially compromise the
security of the computers&#8217; contents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infestation comes after the traveler is presented with
a pop-up window notifying the user to update a widely used
software product. When the user clicks on this window and agrees
to accept the update, the rogue software is installed on the
computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the warning, the FBI recommends that all
private industry, academic and government personnel who travel
abroad &#8220;take extra caution before updating software products on
their hotel Internet connections.&#8221; Instead, the FBI suggests,
travelers should update their software directly from the
software vendors&#8217; websites before leaving home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who believe they have been a target of such attacks
are asked to contact their local FBI offices immediately, and to
report the attack to the Internet Crime Complaint Center&#8217;s
website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IP Moves &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCarter  English Hired Former AstraZeneca Hatch-Waxman Expert &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCarter  English LLP hired Thomas A. Stevens for its IP
and information-technology practice, the Newark, New Jersey-based firm said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stevens, who was previously assistant general counsel,
global IP litigation at AstraZeneca Plc (AZN)&#8217;s AstraZeneca
Pharmaceuticals unit, will specialize in litigation related to
pharmaceutical and biotech companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He previously served as senior patent litigation counsel at
GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) and as senior deputy attorney general in
Delaware&#8217;s Department of Justice. He also practiced in the
patent litigation group at Connolly Bove Lodge  Hutz LLP of
Wilmington, Delaware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He will be handling patent disputes arising under
provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stevens has an undergraduate degree in biology from the
University of Pennsylvania, a master&#8217;s degree in finance from
Drexel University and a law degree from Widener University. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management
Chairman Jim O&#8217;Neill said the U.S. housing market is in the
early stages of a recovery as affordability improves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m in the camp that believes the U.S. housing market is
in the early days of turning,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said at the Society of
Business Economists&#8217; annual conference in London today. &#8220;I just
spent all of last week travelling around the U.S., I was on the
west coast, the east coast, and everywhere I went, I heard quite
lively anecdotes that this was the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;Looking forward, U.S. house prices to personal incomes
are now actually below where they were at the start of the
1990s,&#8217;&#8217; he said. &#8216;&#8216;So for people not trapped in the negative
equity problem, U.S. housing is cheap.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Neill also added that the position of the U.S.
government&#8217;s finances is an &#8216;&#8216;enormous dilemma&#8221; and November&#8217;s
presidential election will not provide a solution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;After being there last week, it&#8217;s not entirely clear to
me that this election coming up is going to solve any of that at
all,&#8221; the economist said. &#8220;The strength of conviction of the
Republicans and Democrats conceptually is so strong, I rather
suspect that, without a financial crisis, it&#8217;s not clear to me
that the U.S. is going to do anything about its fiscal position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;There are such fundamental philosophical differences
about the role of government spending and taxation which are not
easily solved,&#8217;&#8217; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s, trading loss
in its London unit is an example of &#8220;bad risk management,&#8221;
Andrew Bailey, head of banking supervision at the U.K. financial
services authority, told reporters today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bailey said he didn&#8217;t &#8220;see a conduct issue for the
moment&#8221; in the U.K. for the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a very salutary lesson about the use of models and
the dangers of over-reliance on single models,&#8221; Bailey said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects ending year of director&#8217;s tenure in penultimate
paragraph of story originally published May 25, 2012.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three directors who oversee risk
at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) include a museum head who sat on
American International Group Inc.&#8217;s governance committee in
2008, the grandson of a billionaire and the chief executive
officer of a company that makes flight controls and work boots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the risk committee of the biggest U.S. lender lacks,
and what the five next largest competitors have, are directors
who worked at a bank or as financial risk managers. The only
member with any Wall Street experience, James Crown, hasn&#8217;t been
employed in the industry for more than 25 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It seems hard to believe that this is good enough,&#8221; said
Anat Admati, a professor of finance at Stanford University who
studies corporate governance. &#8220;It&#8217;s a massive task to watch the
risk of JPMorgan.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank has been under siege since CEO Jamie Dimon said
May 10 that the firm&#8217;s chief investment office suffered a $2
billion loss trading credit derivatives. He later called it &#8220;a
Risk 101 mistake.&#8221; Shares of the New York-based company have
fallen about 18 percent since, and at least half a dozen
agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice and the
Securities and Exchange Commission, are investigating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lou Lebedin, a former Bear Stearns
Cos. executive who had become JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s global head
of prime brokerage, is being replaced in that role, according to
three people familiar with the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teresa Heitsenrether, 47, based in London, will take over
for Lebedin, 54, said two of the people, who declined to be
identified because the changes aren&#8217;t public. Heitsenrether, who
worked at JPMorgan before the New York-based bank bought Bear
Stearns, was named co-head of fixed-income prime brokerage in
2008 when Lebedin took charge of the equity side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, had the sixth-biggest prime brokerage, according to a ranking by client assets
in Global Custodian magazine&#8217;s 2011 survey. The bank expanded its
prime brokerage in Europe last year and plans a similar move in
Asia this year, Jes Staley, chief executive officer of JPMorgan&#8217;s
investment bank, said in a February presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime brokerages provide financing and administrative
services such as lending, clearing trades and record-keeping that
help managers run their hedge funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes are taking place more than two months after
Sandie O&#8217;Connor was promoted to treasurer. O&#8217;Connor previously
oversaw prime brokerage, futures and options, over-the-counter
derivatives clearing and broker-dealer services. Two of those
units, prime brokerage and broker-dealer services, now report to
John Horner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lebedin was tapped to run JPMorgan&#8217;s equity prime brokerage
in 2008 when JPMorgan bought Bear Stearns, where he held the same
role. In March he was named sole head of global prime brokerage
when his co-head, London-based Andrea Angelone, was moved to run
the bank&#8217;s equity treasury business, the Wall Street Journal
reported on March 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a bank spokeswoman, declined to
comment, and Lebedin didn&#8217;t return a phone message. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Senate Banking Committee
said JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon
was invited to testify on June 7 about the New York-based
lender&#8217;s credit derivatives losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I expect Mr. Dimon to come prepared to provide the
committee a better understanding of this massive trading loss,&#8221;
Senator Tim Johnson, the committee&#8217;s chairman and a South Dakota
Democrat, said in a statement today. Dimon, who runs the largest
bank in the U.S. by assets, indicated previously that he will
accept an invitation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Jamie will of course be able to testify next month,&#8221;
said Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, without
specifying a date. &#8220;We are working with the House and Senate to
determine a timeframe that will work for both chambers in June
and allow us to provide the most thorough testimony.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon is under pressure to explain how bets on illiquid
credit derivatives led to at least $2 billion in losses at his
chief investment office, which is supposed to manage excess cash
while minimizing risk. The strategy was &#8220;flawed, complex,
poorly reviewed, poorly executed and poorly monitored,&#8221;
according to Dimon, 56. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His testimony may influence lawmakers as they haggle over
rules for the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul enacted two years
ago. They&#8217;re debating along with regulators whether the new law
would have prohibited the errant trades and if the rules should
be tighter. Dimon has been campaigning for a looser
interpretation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) office that
lost $2 billion on flawed derivatives trades also owns stakes in
the publisher of Ebony, the magazine for black Americans led by
a former White House social secretary, and Technicolor SA, the
money-losing French maker of film technologies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Special Investments Group, part of JPMorgan&#8217;s chief
investment office, took the minority stake in Johnson Publishing
Co., according to a July press release from the Chicago-based
publisher. The size of the investment wasn&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desiree Rogers, 52, was named chief executive officer of
the family-controlled firm in August 2010, six months after
leaving President Barack Obama&#8217;s White House. She stepped down
after criticism for her handling of a state dinner that was
crashed by a Virginia couple, Tareq and Michaele Salahi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s losses sparked criticism of the New York-based
bank&#8217;s investment office for taking too much risk with the
company&#8217;s idle cash. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon on May
14 accepted the resignation of the office&#8217;s head, Ina Drew,
after wrong-way bets on credit derivatives. Dimon has said the
positions can&#8217;t be quickly unwound and that the losses may
expand at JPMorgan, the largest U.S. lender. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank also invested about $150 million last year in
LightSquared Inc., the failed wireless venture backed by hedge-fund manager Philip Falcone that filed for bankruptcy on May 14,
a person with knowledge of the matter said. Technicolor&#8217;s
unprofitable set-top box factor in Angers, France filed for
insolvency today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Family Enterprise &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson Publishing is majority-owned by the family of
founder John Johnson, according to a video by his daughter,
company Chairman Linda Johnson Rice, which was posted on the
firm&#8217;s website when JPMorgan&#8217;s investment was announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ebony is the No. 1 magazine focused on black Americans,
reaching almost 11 million readers, according to the monthly
magazine&#8217;s website. Circulation dropped 27 percent from 2007
through 2010 before rebounding 8 percent last year to 1.13
million, according to The Association of Magazine Media. Johnson
also owns Jet magazine and Fashion Fair Cosmetics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rogers, a longtime friend of the president and first lady
Michelle Obama, was White House social secretary from January
2009 through February 2010. She had been the Illinois lottery
director and later served as a natural-gas utility executive,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting the Picture &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan plans to invest as much as 158 million euros ($197
million) in Paris-based Technicolor (TCH), according to an
announcement from the company on May 3 -- one week before Dimon
disclosed the derivatives-trading losses. Technicolor&#8217;s shares
tumbled 68 percent in the preceding year and have fallen another
19 percent since the announcement to 1.37 euros. The firm posted
losses for the past five years, according to a notice on the
company&#8217;s website, and its debt is rated as junk by Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service and Standard  Poor&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan holds a 1 percent equity stake and could wind up
with as much as 30 percent, according to Technicolor. The funds
came from JPMorgan and its private-investment arm, One Equity
Partners, according to the Technicolor news release. The Special
Investments Group is one of the shareholders in a fund that
would provide the Technicolor capital injection, said Benedicte
Hautefort, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norma Corio, a former JPMorgan treasurer and restructuring
head who now oversees the Special Investments Group, has been
nominated to become a director of the Technicolor board at a
shareholder meeting scheduled for June 20, according
Technicolor. Also listed among nominees is David Walsh, a
partner and managing director at One Equity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corio, 51, Walsh, 50, and Rogers at Johnson Publishing
didn&#8217;t immediately respond to requests for comment. The stakes
in Ebony and Technicolor were reported yesterday on the Wall
Street Journal&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These activities are done out of the holding company, not
the bank,&#8221; said Kristin Lemkau, a JPMorgan spokeswoman. &#8220;They
are funded with company-issued debt and equity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors are buying more credit-
default swaps on Wall Street banks than any other companies as
they seek insurance against the prospects for diminished revenue
amid tighter regulations, downgrades and Europe&#8217;s debt crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contracts tied to the debt of Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc.,
JPMorgan Chase  Co., Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp.
were the most traded among companies last week, with a combined
gross notional amount of $7.45 billion, according to the latest
data from the Depository Trust  Clearing Corp., which runs a
central registry for the market. Swaps on New York-based Goldman
Sachs were the most active, up from 13th the previous week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls for tighter regulation are intensifying as JPMorgan
grapples with $2 billion of losses on derivative bets and Morgan
Stanley faces an inquiry by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission over Facebook Inc.&#8217;s initial public offering. Global
investment bank revenue will fall 24 percent in the second
quarter, JPMorgan (JPM) analysts wrote in a May 18 note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People are worried about the regulatory scrutiny these
banks will face,&#8221; said Peter Tchir, founder of New York-based
hedge fund TF Market Advisors. &#8220;People now fully believe
regulators are in charge and will get to push things through,
and there&#8217;s a real risk they overregulate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Moody&#8217;s Review &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swaps insuring an average $470 million of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
debt were traded each day last week, double the past month&#8217;s
average of $230 million. They were the seventh most traded of
1,000 entities tracked by the DTCC, following Italy, France,
Brazil, Spain, Turkey and Portugal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contracts on JPMorgan were the second-most traded, up from
ninth and the eighth highest overall, followed by Russia and
Mexico. Morgan Stanley jumped three levels to third among
companies and Bank of America advanced to fourth from 19th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s Investors Service is in the process of reviewing
its credit ratings for banks, and may downgrade 26 lenders,
according to a May 22 report from JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Moody&#8217;s remains the largest overhang for the sector,&#8221;
strategist at the New York-based bank wrote in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in credit markets, United Technologies Corp. (UTX)
raised $9.8 billion in the largest U.S. corporate bond sale in
more than three years to help finance its $16.5 billion
acquisition of Goodrich Corp. (GR) Vanguard Group Inc., the world&#8217;s
biggest mutual-fund provider, closed its $16.9 billion High
Yield Corporate Fund (VWEHX) to most new investors. Cheniere Energy
Partners LP is seeking $2.05 billion of loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Swap Spreads Fall &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. two-year interest-rate swap spread, a measure of
debt market stress, declined 0.4 basis point to 34.4 basis
points. The gauge, which has dropped from a four-month high of
39.13 on May 15, narrows when investors favor assets such as
corporate bonds and widens when they seek the perceived safety
of government securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of protecting corporate debt from default in the
U.S. declined for a second day, with the Markit CDX North
America Investment Grade Index of credit-default swaps, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, falling 1.03 basis point to a
mid-price of 117.24 basis points, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg. The index has dropped from a five-month high of
123.4 on May 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings was unchanged at 175 basis points at
10:40 a.m. in London. The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40
investment-grade borrowers outside Japan declined 2 to 196,
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;United Technologies Bonds &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indexes typically fall as investor confidence improves
and rise as it deteriorates. Credit swaps pay the buyer face
value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the
value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000
annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds of Hartford, Connecticut-based United Technologies
were the most actively traded dollar-denominated corporate
securities by dealers, with 304 trades of $1 million or more,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;United Technologies bond sale was the largest in dollars
since March 2009, when Pfizer Inc. (PFE) sold $13.5 billion of bonds
in a five-part offering, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maker of Sikorsky helicopters and Pratt  Whitney
engines, with investment-grade ratings from Moody&#8217;s Investors
Service and Standard  Poor&#8217;s, is seeking to lure bond buyers as
turmoil in Europe sends them to safer assets. While speculative-
grade bonds in the U.S. have declined 1.3 percent this month,
investment grade is unchanged, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vanguard Funds &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its previous sale in February 2010, the Hartford,
Connecticut-based company sold $2.25 billion of debt split
between 10- and 30-year maturities, Bloomberg-compiled data
show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanguard restricted access to its fund after clients poured
$2 billion into it over the past six months. The fund, managed
by Boston-based Wellington Management Co. since 1978, remains
open to existing shareholders and some Vanguard clients, the
Valley Forge, Pennsylvania-based company said yesterday in a
statement. The fund has gained 4.2 percent this year, trailing
61 percent of rivals, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are taking these proactive steps to preserve the
ability of the advisor to manage the fund effectively and
protect the interests of existing shareholders,&#8221; William McNabb, Vanguard&#8217;s chief executive officer, said in the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors have poured money into funds that invest in
higher-yielding securities as the Federal Reserve has kept rates
near zero since December 2008. U.S. high-yield mutual funds
attracted $16.6 billion in deposits this year through April,
second-highest among all categories tracked by Morningstar Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Loan Prices Fall &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 index fell for a
second day by 0.05 cent to 92.79 cents on the dollar. The
measure, which tracks the 100 largest dollar-denominated first-
lien leveraged loans, has declined from 94.56 cents on May 14,
the highest since July 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leveraged loans and high-yield bonds are rated below Baa3
by Moody&#8217;s and lower than BBB- by SP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheniere Energy&#8217;s debt is intended to help fund the
expansion of a liquefied natural gas facility in Louisiana. The
energy company is seeking a 6.5 year $750 million term loan with
proceeds being used to finance the acquisition of the Creole
Trail Pipeline, said a person familiar with the transaction, who
declined to be identified because the terms are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Group AG is arranging the financing and will
host a lender meeting May 29 at 2 p.m. in New York, said the
person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Volker Rule &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In emerging markets, relative yields fell 4 basis points to
404 basis points or 4.04 percentage points, according to
JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s EMBI Global index. The measure has
averaged 372.5 this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are under pressure as Europe&#8217;s debt crisis causes
lenders to retrench and fire thousands. In the U.S., the so-
called Volcker rule, the provision in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act
named for former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, will set
limits on risk-taking by depositories with government backing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s losses, which Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon called &#8220;egregious,&#8221; self-inflicted mistakes that he said
could increase by $1 billion, came at a key point in the almost
two-year-old debate over Wall Street regulation. The 2010 Dodd-
Frank Act, which includes a ban on proprietary trading by banks,
is being decided by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and
the Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bank Revenue Falls &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Lessons will have to be learned and heads may have to
roll,&#8221; said Georg Grodzki, who helps manage $515 billion as
head of credit research at Legal  General Investment Management
in London. &#8220;I hope it stops there and regulators resist the
habitual urge to throw more regulation at banks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While global investment bank revenue will fall 24 percent
this quarter, fixed income, currencies and commodities will be
the worst hit, dropping 32 percent from the previous quarter,
JPMorgan analysts led by Kian Abouhossein wrote in a May 18
note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan &#8216;s announcement May 10 that the biggest U.S. bank
by assets had lost $2 billion on corporate credit indexes fueled
a surge in the cost of insuring debt across Wall Street. Default
swaps on the bank jumped as high as 154 basis points this week
from 90 in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swaps on Goldman Sachs soared to a 5 1/2-month high of 348
basis points May 21 from 200 in March. Morgan Stanley climbed to
453 this week from 278 in March and Bank of America rose to 306
from 200 in March. Swaps on Citigroup Inc. rose as high as 271
this week, from 183 in March while Wells Fargo  Co. got as high
as 126 from 80 in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Regulatory Requirements&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their bonds have also suffered. The extra yield investors
demand to hold the debt of banks worldwide instead of benchmark
government securities increased 47 basis points to 294 basis
points as of March 23 from the low this year of 247 on March 21,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch&#8217;s Global Corporates,
Banking index. Investors in the bonds have lost 0.45 percent
this month, heading for the first monthly decline since
November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of deteriorating market conditions and
&#8220;increased regulatory requirements and restrictions has
diminished longer-term profitability and growth prospects,&#8221;
according to Tony Smith, a senior banking analyst at Moody&#8217;s
Analytics in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Default swaps on Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley imply
credit ratings that are six levels lower than their actual
grades, according to Moody&#8217;s Analytics, while JPMorgan&#8217;s signal
the bank should be rated five levels lower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further deterioration in the perceived credit quality of
banks may spark the Federal Reserve to provide more assistance
to the financial system, according to TF&#8217;s Tchir. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wall Street Reputation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With bank swaps rising &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to believe the Fed is
watching that as much as any other economic data,&#8221; Tchir said.
&#8220;Their biggest fear is getting back to where people don&#8217;t trust
the banks and stop trading with each other.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reputation of Wall Street banks took a hit as the IPO
of Facebook (FB) turned into a quagmire of blame as the company&#8217;s
shares tumbled. Buyers of the stock sued the company, Nasdaq OMX
Group Inc. and the underwriters, claiming they were misled. The
SEC and the brokerage industry&#8217;s watchdog both said they may
review the offering, and the scrutiny prompted Morgan Stanley,
the lead underwriter, to defend its handling of the IPO in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank risk is also rising as Europe&#8217;s sovereign debt crisis
deepens, with investors concerned that a Greek exit from the
euro area may trigger a banking crisis. Loan and currency losses
in the event of a euro breakup may reach $1.1 trillion across
German, French, U.K., U.S., Swedish, Swiss, Dutch, Austrian and
Belgian banking systems, analysts at Paris-based Societe
Generale SA estimated in a note last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market is more correlated now than it was two to
three weeks ago,&#8221; said Graham Neilson, who helps manage about
$20 billion as chief investment strategist at Cairn Capital Ltd.
in London. &#8220;The losses have clearly impacted JPMorgan&#8217;s bottom
line and there&#8217;s stuff going on in Greece and Europe that
impacts everyone.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkish officials believe Greek
deposits could flow to Turkish banks if Greece leaves the euro,
JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkish authorities &#8220;hope that there could be some deposit
flow from Greece to Turkey,&#8221; Istanbul-based economist Yarkin Cebeci said in a report sent after the market close yesterday.
&#8220;Turkish banks are perceived to be strong and out of the radar
of the European Central Bank and EU officials who could track
Greek money in other eurozone countries.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkish authorities are &#8220;downplaying the risk of a serious
impact through the funding channel,&#8221; citing Turkey&#8217;s relatively
low total debt levels and &#8220;the diversification of funding
sources to include more sources from the Middle East and
Northern Africa region and the Far East,&#8221; Cebeci said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan report is based on meetings with Turkish
government and central bank officials in Istanbul and Ankara on
May 21 and May 22, Cebeci said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discharge took place at about 10:30 a.m., Russell Johnson, a Houston-based spokesman for Chevron, said in an e-

said. No one was injured. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson didn&#8217;t say how much oil was spilled. The Cymric

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank, increased the capital of its China unit by 2.5
billion yuan ($394 million) to meet rising demand for financial
services in the world&#8217;s fastest-growing major economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second infusion since the local subsidiary was
incorporated in 2007 will bring its capital to 6.5 billion yuan,
the New York-based lender said in an e-mailed statement today.
The U.S. bank also received approval from the China Banking
Regulatory Commission to open a branch in Suzhou. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan joins Australia  New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)
and DBS Group Holdings Ltd. (DBS) in adding to investments in China,
seeking a bigger share of the world&#8217;s third-biggest banking
market, where local currency loans have grown by an average 22
percent a year since 2008. Foreign banks may lend a maximum of
10 percent of their net capital to a single borrower, which
limited their participation in the three-year lending boom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPMorgan now sees a good opportunity to expand in China,
given that there&#8217;s a lot of demand for all kinds of financial
services,&#8221; Victoria Mio, a Hong Kong-based portfolio manager at
Robeco Hong Kong Ltd., whose parent firm oversees about $222
billion in assets globally as of March 31, said by telephone.
&#8220;There&#8217;s still growth in China, versus other parts of the world
where there&#8217;s contraction or slower growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Third-Largest Market &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 114 trillion yuan of assets at the end of last year,
China&#8217;s banking system is larger than the combined size of the
30 other emerging markets tracked by Fitch Ratings, and smaller
than only the U.S. and Japan. About 45 percent of the nation&#8217;s
55 trillion yuan of outstanding loans were doled out in the past
three years as the government spurred lending during the global
financial crisis to resuscitate the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign banks more than doubled their combined profit from
China to 16.7 billion yuan last year, according to the banking
regulator. JPMorgan&#8217;s China unit earned 297.3 million yuan in
2011, compared with 70.4 million yuan a year earlier, according
to its annual report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANZ Bank said this month it plans to invest $300 million in
its China unit. DBS, Southeast Asia&#8217;s largest bank, announced in
April it would inject 2.3 billion yuan into its Chinese
subsidiary, adding to a 4 billion-yuan initial investment five
years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The additional capital will better position the bank in
the evolving regulatory environment and cement our commitment to
clients in China,&#8221; Shao Zili, chairman and chief executive
officer of JPMorgan China, said in the statement. &#8220;The capital
will be used to expand the bank&#8217;s branch network, develop
products, increase corporate lending and recruit employees.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ties Since 1911 &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank&#8217;s ties to China go back to 1911, when it led
a syndicate in managing a railway company&#8217;s $7.5 million bond
sale. In 1921, Equitable Eastern Banking Corp., one of
JPMorgan&#8217;s predecessor firms, opened a Shanghai branch,
according to the lender&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has branches in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin,
Guangzhou, Chengdu and Harbin. The company also offers
investment banking services in China through a joint venture
with First Capital Securities Co. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free-agent pitcher Roy Oswalt signed
with the Texas Rangers, who are trying to reach their third
straight World Series, the Dallas Morning News reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oswalt, 34, who had two stints on the disabled list last
season while with the Philadelphia Phillies because of lower
back inflammation, is likely to make a few minor-league starts
before joining the Rangers, the newspaper said, citing an
individual familiar with the process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An e-mail seeking comment from John Blake, a spokesman for
the team, wasn&#8217;t immediately returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oswalt, a right-hander, pitched 10 seasons with the Houston
Astros before joining the Phillies at the 2010 trade deadline.
The three-time All-Star has a 159-93 career record with a 3.21
earned run average, 1,759 strikeouts and 500 walks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An opening in the Rangers rotation arose when right-hander
Neftali Feliz was placed on the disabled list on May 19 with a
sprained ligament in his right elbow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas has never won Major League Baseball&#8217;s championship.
The Rangers fell in seven games to the St. Louis Cardinals in
last season&#8217;s World Series after losing to the San Francisco
Giants the year before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) is considering using
solar energy to produce the steam needed to pump heavy crude
from an oilfield straddling Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron may start a pilot solar plant at the end of 2013,
Hashim al-Rifaai, chairman and managing director of Kuwait Gulf
Oil Co., told reporters in Abu Dhabi today. Energy from the sun
would heat water to create steam, which would then be injected
underground to make the heavy oil liquid enough to flow, al-Rifaai said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solar power would be used in conjunction with burning
natural gas for the so-called steam-flood development at the
Wafra field in the Neutral Zone, which Saudi Arabia and Kuwait
share. Kuwait Gulf is responsible for managing Kuwait&#8217;s share,
while Chevron operates Saudi Arabia&#8217;s interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron is assessing the use of solar energy as it seeks to
free up much-needed natural gas. Kuwait buys the fuel in liquid
form at international prices while Saudi Arabia burns crude in
its power stations because they don&#8217;t have sufficient local
supply of gas to generate electricity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final investment decision for steam injection in the
Wafra field will be made next year, with the aim of producing as
much as 600,000 barrels a day of heavy oil from 2017. Saudi
Arabia, the largest member in the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, says it&#8217;s pumping more than 10 million
barrels of oil, the highest in more than three decades. Kuwait&#8217;s
output was 2.7 million barrels last month, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every barrel of oil would need about 5 barrels of steam,
according to Yasser Dib, regional vice president at BrightSource
Energy Inc. The solar-thermal technology company supplied the
plant, which Chevron has been using since October to extract
crude at its Coalinga field in southern California. The system
uses mirrors to focus sunlight on a boiler to produce steam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neutral zone is producing 220,000 barrels a day onshore
and 320,000 barrels offshore, al-Rifaai said. While the offshore
target is 350,000 barrels, onshore output is dropping.
Developing the heavy oil would help maintain total output and
the crude would be exported to Asia, upgraded or used in a
planned refinery in Kuwait, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) shareholders again
rejected a proposal to split the chairman and chief executive
officer roles amid increasing investor scrutiny of board
accountability in the energy industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixty-five percent of votes opposed the separation, down
from 69 percent last year, according to a tally announced at the
company&#8217;s annual meeting in Dallas today. This was the 11th
consecutive year in which the shareholder resolution failed. Rex Tillerson has served in both roles for the Irving, Texas-based
company since January 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 41 percent of the companies in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s
500 Index have separate chairmen and CEOs, according to Ram
Trust Services, a Portland, Maine-based investment fund and lead
sponsor of today&#8217;s resolution. Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK), the
second-largest U.S. natural-gas producer after Exxon, announced
May 1 that it will appoint an independent chairman and strip CEO
Aubrey McClendon of the job after revelations that he personally
borrowed money from the company&#8217;s financiers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A combined CEO-chair role potentially establishes an
imperial CEO, lessening accountability,&#8221; Ram said in its
written proposal. &#8220;Chairing and overseeing the board is a time-
intensive responsibility, and a separate chair leaves the CEO
free to manage the company and build effective business
strategies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tillerson&#8217;s Seat &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal wouldn&#8217;t have forced Tillerson to surrender
the chairman&#8217;s seat. It would&#8217;ve directed the board to find a
new chairman when the next CEO is named. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chesapeake is searching for a new chairman after starting
an internal probe of McClendon&#8217;s personal finances. The Oklahoma
City-based company&#8217;s annual shareholders&#8217; meeting is scheduled
for June 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest U.S. oil company, said
about 62 percent of votes cast at its annual meeting today were
against a shareholder proposal that called for an independent
chairman. About 64 percent of oil and gas producer Anadarko
Petroleum Corp. (APC) shareholders rejected a proposal to make its
chairman an independent director at the company&#8217;s May 15 annual
meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon opposes splitting the roles on the grounds that
directors should judge who is most qualified to fulfill the
chairman and CEO roles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The board retains authority to amend the bylaws to
separate the positions of chairman and CEO at any time,&#8221;
according to an April 12 proxy statement. Exxon&#8217;s 11 board
members were re-elected to their positions today. One member
retired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Insular Corporate Culture&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal was supported by the AFL-CIO, which represents
more than 12 million union workers, and activist investors
including the Needmore Fund and several descendants of John D.
Rockefeller, who founded Exxon&#8217;s predecessor companies in the
1880s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ram Trust held about 120,000 Exxon shares in the $168
million of equities it had under management as of March 31,
according to a filing with the Securities  Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Splitting the roles would break down Exxon&#8217;s &#8220;very insular
corporate culture,&#8221; said Tracey Rembert, senior manager of
investor engagement at Ceres, a sustainability advocacy group.
&#8220;There really has to be an independent person leading the
board.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other shareholder proposals, including a requirement that
Exxon report on its political contributions and a company policy
prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation, were
also defeated at the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon fell 2.6 percent to $79.79 at the close in New York.
The shares have declined 5.9 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
had its corporate credit rating upgraded to AA- from A+ by
Standard  Poor&#8217;s Rating Services, which cited the company&#8217;s
lucrative shift to software and services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP also boosted its short-term rating on IBM to A-1+ from
A-1, according to a report today. The outlook is stable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider,
expects software to deliver half of its earnings in 2015. The
Armonk, New York-based company is relatively low risk and its
effort to get more revenue from software and services is
improving profit margins, Martha Toll-Reed, an SP analyst in
New York, said in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;IBM&#8217;s good market position and broad product and revenue
base provide cash flow and ratings stability,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Highly competitive industry conditions, a moderately
acquisitive growth strategy, and significant share repurchases
currently constrain the potential for a higher rating.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM shares fell less than 1 percent to $194.53 at the close

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This verdict affirms the fact that Wyeth acted
responsibly by communicating accurately the risks and benefits
of its hormone therapy medicines,&#8221; Chris Loder, a Pfizer
spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 6 million women took Prempro and related
menopause drugs to treat symptoms such as hot flashes and mood
swings before a 2002 study highlighted their links to cancer.
Wyeth&#8217;s sales of the medicines, which are still on the market,
topped $2 billion before the release of the Women&#8217;s Health
Initiative, a National Institutes of Health-sponsored study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Premarin,
Wyeth&#8217;s estrogen-based drug, with progestin-laden Provera, made
by Pfizer&#8217;s Upjohn unit, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth
combined the two hormones in its Prempro pill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moss, a Danbury, Connecticut, resident, took all three
drugs over a seven-year period starting in 1993 to treat her
menopause symptoms, according to court filings. She was
diagnosed with breast cancer in 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Evidentiary Rulings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Moss&#8217;s family, who pressed on with her lawsuit
after her death, said in an e-mailed statement today that they
were disappointed with the jury&#8217;s verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a great deal of evidence that was excluded from
this trial that we believe hampered the jury&#8217;s ability to
appropriately consider all of the issues,&#8221; Neal Moskow, one of
the family&#8217;s attorneys, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth and Upjohn units have now won 10 of 21
Prempro cases decided by juries since trials began in 2006,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based drugmaker got some of the verdicts
against it thrown out after trial or had the awards reduced. It
resolved some of the verdicts through settlements, while other
decisions are on appeal. Pfizer also has had cases thrown out
before trial and settled others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer announced in May 2011 it had settled a third of the
pending Prempro cases and had set aside $772 million to help
resolve the claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Winning Streak &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his statement, Loder said the verdict in the Moss case
means Pfizer has now won eight of the last 10 cases that &#8220;have
reached a final trial verdict.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s win comes about a month after another
Connecticut jury ordered Pfizer to pay at least $4 million in
damages to a woman who developed breast cancer after taking
Prempro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That jury, in federal court in New Haven, found Wyeth
liable for causing Margaret Fraser&#8217;s cancer and awarded
compensatory and punitive damages. A judge is considering how
much Pfizer should pay in punishment damages, according to court
dockets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Moss case is Lynn Gardner Moss and Kenneth P. Moss v.
Wyeth, 04-cv-1511, U.S. District Court, District of Connecticut
(Bridgeport). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s Disney Channel is
releasing an application that will enable the children&#8217;s network
to be watched on Internet-connected mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app may become available next week, Disney Chief
Executive Officer Robert Iger said today at a Sanford C.
Bernstein investor conference in New York. Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) has
agreed to pay for the service, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney is adding outlets for its films and television shows
to boost revenue, Iger said. Disney Channel is drawing some of
its highest ratings ever after making some shows available
online, including on Netflix Inc.&#8217;s streaming service, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Anytime there&#8217;s a new platform or window, the goal is to
increase incremental revenue,&#8221; Iger said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, fell 0.6 percent to
$45.22 at 11:12 a.m. in New York. The shares had climbed 21
percent this year before today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court let stand a
jury verdict that will cost Cie. de Saint-Gobain SA&#8217;s ceramics
and plastics business more than $44 million in a patent fight
with a Siemens AG (SIE) unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rejecting a Saint-Gobain appeal in a dispute over a crystal
used in medical-imaging devices, the justices yesterday refused
to question a federal appeals court ruling that upheld the
verdict. The appeals court also told a trial judge to consider
increasing the $44.9 million award to account for additional
products that infringed Siemens&#8217;s patent 4,958,080. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court rebuff came at the urging of the Obama
administration, which told the justices that the appeals court
reached the right conclusion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute was over the composition of crystals that
convert gamma rays into light to produce a three-dimensional
image of the body to test for diseases. Siemens, based in
Munich, makes crystals for its positron emission tomography, or
PET, tests. Saint-Gobain, based in Courbevoie, France, produces
the crystals for products made by Royal Philips Electronics NV. (PHG) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siemens Medical Solutions USA was awarded $44.9 million
after it sued in 2007 over the sale of crystals for 61 scanners
made by Philips Medical Systems. The U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit in Washington said the trial court should
have included a royalty award on 18 additional scanners. Philips
wasn&#8217;t named in the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saint-Gobain is Europe&#8217;s biggest supplier of building
materials and Siemens is Europe&#8217;s largest engineering company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Saint-Gobain Ceramics  Plastics v. Siemens
Medical Solutions USA, 11-301. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Technicolor Dissects IPhones in Hunt for Patent Payoff &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s next iPhone hits store shelves,
Technicolor SA (TCH)&#8217;s engineers will rush to get the handset -- not
to make calls or play games, but to rip it apart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technicolor, an unprofitable French company that invented
the process for color movies used in &#8220;The Wizard of Oz&#8221; and
countless other classics, plans to cash in on its 40,000 video,
audio and optics patents to turn its fortunes around. The
company has a team of 220 people dissecting every new smartphone
and tablet from industry goliaths such as Apple, Samsung
Electronics Co. (005930) and HTC Corp. (2498) for patent infringements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc., creator of the market-leading Android mobile-
phone technology, this month completed the $12.5 billion
takeover of Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc.&#8217;s mobile-phone
business and its 17,000 patents. Equipment vendor Ericsson AB
expects to increase revenue from its 27,000 patents, while rival
Alcatel-Lucent SA (ALU) says it plans to generate several hundred
million euros this year alone from its 29,000 rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompted by surging demand for patents that regulate
functions such as sliding gestures on touchscreens or the
rendering of graphics for games and applications, lawsuits over
smartphone and tablet technology have been filed worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patent licensing is Technicolor&#8217;s most profitable business.
The licensing division had a 76 percent operating profit margin
last year, helped by 1,200 contracts with television, computer
and handset makers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third Point LLC and Apollo Management Holdings, which
together own 13.4 percent of Technicolor according to data
compiled by Bloomberg, have been pushing for a sale of the
company&#8217;s patent portfolio, Le Figaro newspaper reported April
19. Third Point and Apollo representatives declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the patent licensing business is lucrative, it often
takes time before a company can cash in. Patent negotiations
often last between one and four years, de Russe said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is currently fighting in U.S. courts with
Taiwanese manufacturers over patents used in LCD computer
monitors, after it filed a complaint with the International
Trade Commission. The process was started after several years of
failed discussions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve got a reputation for charging reasonable licensing
fees and preferring friendly negotiations,&#8221; Beatrix de Russe
said. She is a lawyer and the executive vice president of
intellectual property at Technicolor. &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t mean we
don&#8217;t drag people to court from time to time,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Google&#8217;s YouTube Wins French Case Over Copyrighted TV Clips &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s YouTube video-sharing website won a French
copyright lawsuit filed by broadcaster TF1, which had sought
more than 140 million euros ($175 million). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube can&#8217;t be held responsible for videos posted by
users because it merely hosts the content, the Paris Tribunal de
Grande Instance said in a ruling yesterday. The court dismissed
TF1&#8217;s claims and ordered it to pay YouTube 80,000 euros in
costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TF1 sued Google in 2008, seeking damages for broadcasts
illegally uploaded by users, including the Oscar-winning film
&#8220;La Vie En Rose&#8221; and &#8220;Grey&#8217;s Anatomy,&#8221; a U.S. medical drama
for which it holds the French broadcast rights. The case is
similar to a U.S. lawsuit by Viacom Inc. (VIAB) that seeks $1 billion
in compensation for illegal uploads of its programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christophe Muller, Google&#8217;s head of YouTube partnerships
for southern Europe, said the decision meant Google could host
content posted by users &#8220;without fearing a giant liability.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The end result will be more videos posted on the net,
more revenue generated for creative artists, and more exposure
to a global audience for these artists,&#8221; Muller said in a blog
post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juliette Dumas, a spokeswoman for TF1 in Paris, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the ruling.
The decision can be appealed to a higher court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kim Dotcom Can Return to Luxury Mansion, New Zealand Court Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Megaupload.com founder Kim Dotcom, accused of orchestrating
the biggest copyright-infringement conspiracy in U.S. history,
can return to his leased luxury mansion after a New Zealand
court relaxed bail terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge ruled yesterday that Dotcom was no longer a
flight risk, granting the removal of electronic tags the
Internet tycoon was required to wear, according to a report on
stuff.co.nz. Dotcom had been staying in a smaller home next to
the mansion in an Auckland suburb. Ministry of Justice
spokespeople were unable to obtain a copy of the ruling for
Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dotcom, 38, was indicted in what U.S. prosecutors dubbed a
&#8220;Mega Conspiracy,&#8221; accusing his file-sharing website of
generating more than $175 million in criminal proceeds from the
exchange of pirated film, music, book and software files. He
faces as long as 20 years in prison for each of the racketeering
and money-laundering charges in the indictment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German-born Dotcom was arrested at his residence in late
January and spent four weeks in jail before being released to
await an extradition hearing, currently scheduled for Aug. 20.
When police raided the mansion in Coatesville, north of
Auckland, they seized 18 luxury vehicles, including a Rolls
Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe and a 1959 pink Cadillac. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dotcom mansion is valued at NZ$30 million ($23
million), according to an article on the stuff.co.nz website.
The property is also known as the &#8220;Chrisco mansion,&#8221; because
it was built by the founders of the Christmas hamper company,
Chrisco Hampers Australia Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dotcom last month said that New Zealand politician John
Banks, leader of the one-seat ACT party in coalition with Prime
Minister John Key&#8217;s government, incorrectly reported that
donations of NZ$50,000 from Dotcom toward his failed 2010 bid
for the Auckland mayoralty were anonymous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dotcom then lampooned the politician in a rap song he
recorded at Crowded House singer Neil Finn&#8217;s recording studio in
Auckland, along with an accompanying music video. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;China Supreme Court to Hear AMSC Intellectual-Property Suit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Superconductor Corp. (AMSC), a U.S. maker of wind-turbine
components, said China&#8217;s highest court agreed to hear an
intellectual-property suit against Sinovel Wind Group Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is seeking $200,000 in damages and is the smallest
of four suits AMSC is pursuing in China against its former
largest customer, the Devens, Massachusetts-based company said
in an e-mailed statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMSC is seeking a total of more than $1.2 billion in
damages from China&#8217;s biggest turbine maker for allegedly
violating sales contracts and stealing its technology. Sinovel
stopped accepting contracted shipments in March 2011. A former
AMSC employee in Austria pleaded guilty in September to charges
including economic espionage for passing software to Sinovel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A provincial court dismissed the $200,000 case in February
and AMSC filed its appeal with China&#8217;s Supreme People&#8217;s Court in
April. The copyright infringement suit also names Dalian Guotong
Electric Co. as a defendant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMSC said in the statement that there is a &#8220;significant
amount of evidence that its copyrighted software is being
infringed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IBM Sets Guidelines to Prevent Data Loss on Employees&#8217; Devices &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)&#8217;s &#8220;bring your own
device&#8221; policy has some downsides, Jeanette Horan, the
company&#8217;s chief information officer, said in an interview
published in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#8217;s
Technology Review magazine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said many employees, who are using their own
smartphones and tablets, were &#8220;blissfully unaware&#8221; of
potential security risks some popular apps could pose, according
to Technology Review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, based in Armonk, New York, has set up guidelines for
apps that should be avoided, including public file-transfer
services Horan said could potentially let confidential company
information out for public viewing, Technology Review reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All employee-owned devices used to access IBM networks must
be configured by the company&#8217;s information-technology department
so the memory can be purged remotely if the device is stolen,
Horan told Technology Review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ownership Claim for &#8216;Hon&#8217; Mark All a Mistake, Festival Head Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though Baltimore restaurateur Denise Whiting abandoned
her attempts to register &#8220;hon&#8221; with the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office last year, promotional material for the annual
&#8220;HonFest&#8221; celebration of Baltimore&#8217;s favorite term of
endearment warned would-be users of the term that they were in
danger of trademark infringement, the Baltimore Sun reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Festival paperwork for HonFest, which centers around
Whiting&#8217;s Caf&#233; Hon, warned that items bearing the word &#8220;hon&#8221;
without permission would be subject to confiscation as
counterfeit merchandise, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lisa Davis, who headed &#8220;HonFest,&#8221; told the Sun it was all
a mistake and said the warning was included because she hadn&#8217;t
noticed it was still included in the promotional material. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tissue Paper Rings Violate Olympics Marks, London Florist Warned &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A London florist was told her display of five tissue paper
rings was a trademark violation and that she could be sued by
the committee organizing the London 2012 Olympic Games and Coca-
Cola Co., the games&#8217; sponsor, This Is Staffordshire news website
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The florist said she had only intended to &#8220;help people get
into the Olympic spirit,&#8221; and &#8220;was just trying to support&#8221;
her nation&#8217;s team rather than advertise her own products,
according to the website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the London Organizing Committee of the
Olympic and Paralympic Games said that each case of potential
infringement will be dealt with &#8220;on an individual basis,&#8221; but
the committee&#8217;s preference was for education about trademark
rights rather than litigation, the website reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Symphony Financial Partners, co-
founded by an ex-Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. trader in 2003, is
seeking $1 billion from investors after its Japan-focused hedge
fund returned more than four times its peers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Baran, co-chief executive officer of Tokyo-based
Symphony, is targeting about $500 million in new allocations for
the $200 million SFP Value Realization Fund, which invests in
Japanese companies and works with management to prompt corporate
actions such as share buybacks, he said. Symphony is also
opening up the $21 million Sinfonietta fund, an Asia-focused
macro fund, and looking to raise $400 million to $500 million
from outside investors for it, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baran, who traded stocks and equity derivatives as a
proprietary trader at Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers in
Tokyo, is seeking to entice investor appetite with his fund
performances as hedge funds globally struggle to capture new
allocations. The Japan fund has returned 16 percent through
April this year, beating the 3.6 percent return by the
Eurekahedge Hedge Fund Index, while Sinfonietta fund gained 6.8
percent this year, according to Baran. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our Japan experience has affected our world view, which
has aided performance,&#8221; Baran said in an interview from his
Tokyo office. &#8220;It&#8217;s timely to increase our exposure and assets
as unlocking value is becoming easier with a dramatic increase
of corporate actions in Japan.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mispriced Stocks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s stock benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average has added
2.1 percent this year, rebounding from last year&#8217;s 17 percent
slide, and is trading at 1.38 price-to-book value. A reading
below one means a company can be bought for less than the value
of its assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baran plans to achieve the fundraising targets within the
next two years. Symphony&#8217;s current investors are pensions,
endowments, funds-of-hedge funds, family offices and high-net-
worth individuals, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Value Realization fund has gained 57 percent net of
fees since inception in September 2003, during which the Nikkei
225 Stock Average (NKY) declined about 5 percent, according to Baran.
The fund invests in 15 companies with average market
capitalization of $200 million to $300 million because companies
that size tend to have the &#8220;greatest mispricing,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;From the beginning, we have held that the Japanese equity
market is highly inefficient -- nowhere else in the world do
price and value diverge like in Japan,&#8221; Baran said. &#8220;The lack
of a market for corporate control can lead to huge disparities
between price and value.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nagawa Buyback &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the contributors to the fund&#8217;s recent outperformance
was Nagawa Co., which makes, sells and rents prefabricated
offices and stores, Baran said. Symphony worked with the
management of Nagawa to buy back its own shares to boost the
stock price, because shares were trading below their intrinsic
value despite their strong earnings and dividends, he said.
Nagawa announced a plan to buy back 6.6 percent of its shares on
May 21 and has gained 29 percent since then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanjo Machine Works Ltd., which makes auto parts for
companies including Honda Motor Co., was another contributor to
the fund&#8217;s performance. Symphony prompted a management buyout of
the company last year, Baran said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We seek situations where we can work closely with
management to cause that huge gap between where the shares are
traded and what the whole enterprise is worth to close,&#8221; Baran
said, adding that the number of management buyouts is increasing
in Japan where deal premiums have averaged between 50 to 60
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bank Support &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;More deals will be done in the future as banks are now
highly supportive of corporate actions,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sinfonietta fund, which seeks to profit on macroeconomic
trends by wagering on bonds, currencies, stocks and commodities,
started in 2008 with partners&#8217; capital and returned 29 percent
in 2011, Baran said. The gain compares with the 1.2 percent
decline by the Eurekahedge Macro Hedge Fund Index of similar
funds last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symphony was co-founded by Baran and Kazuhiko Shibata, who
was an MA and real estate banker at Nomura Securities Co. in
New York and Tokyo, according to the company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Technicolor Dissects IPhones in Hunt for Patent Payoff &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s next iPhone hits store shelves,
Technicolor SA (TCH)&#8217;s engineers will rush to get the handset -- not
to make calls or play games, but to rip it apart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technicolor, an unprofitable French company that invented
the process for color movies used in &#8220;The Wizard of Oz&#8221; and
countless other classics, plans to cash in on its 40,000 video,
audio and optics patents to turn its fortunes around. The
company has a team of 220 people dissecting every new smartphone
and tablet from industry goliaths such as Apple, Samsung
Electronics Co. (005930) and HTC Corp. (2498) for patent infringements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc., creator of the market-leading Android mobile-phone technology, this month completed the $12.5 billion
takeover of Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc.&#8217;s mobile-phone
business and its 17,000 patents. Equipment vendor Ericsson AB
expects to increase revenue from its 27,000 patents, while rival
Alcatel-Lucent SA (ALU) says it plans to generate several hundred
million euros this year alone from its 29,000 rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompted by surging demand for patents that regulate
functions such as sliding gestures on touchscreens or the
rendering of graphics for games and applications, lawsuits over
smartphone and tablet technology have been filed worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patent licensing is Technicolor&#8217;s most profitable business.
The licensing division had a 76 percent operating profit margin
last year, helped by 1,200 contracts with television, computer
and handset makers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third Point LLC and Apollo Management Holdings, which
together own 13.4 percent of Technicolor according to data
compiled by Bloomberg, have been pushing for a sale of the
company&#8217;s patent portfolio, Le Figaro newspaper reported April
19. Third Point and Apollo representatives declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the patent licensing business is lucrative, it often
takes time before a company can cash in. Patent negotiations
often last between one and four years, de Russe said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is currently fighting in U.S. courts with
Taiwanese manufacturers over patents used in LCD computer
monitors, after it filed a complaint with the International
Trade Commission. The process was started after several years of
failed discussions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve got a reputation for charging reasonable licensing
fees and preferring friendly negotiations,&#8221; Beatrix de Russe
said. She is a lawyer and the executive vice president of
intellectual property at Technicolor. &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t mean we
don&#8217;t drag people to court from time to time,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Google&#8217;s YouTube Wins French Case Over Copyrighted TV Clips &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s YouTube video-sharing website won a French
copyright lawsuit filed by broadcaster TF1, which had sought
more than 140 million euros ($175 million). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube can&#8217;t be held responsible for videos posted by
users because it merely hosts the content, the Paris Tribunal de
Grande Instance said in a ruling yesterday. The court dismissed
TF1&#8217;s claims and ordered it to pay YouTube 80,000 euros in
costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TF1 sued Google in 2008, seeking damages for broadcasts
illegally uploaded by users, including the Oscar-winning film
&#8220;La Vie En Rose&#8221; and &#8220;Grey&#8217;s Anatomy,&#8221; a U.S. medical drama
for which it holds the French broadcast rights. The case is
similar to a U.S. lawsuit by Viacom Inc. (VIAB) that seeks $1 billion
in compensation for illegal uploads of its programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christophe Muller, Google&#8217;s head of YouTube partnerships
for southern Europe, said the decision meant Google could host
content posted by users &#8220;without fearing a giant liability.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The end result will be more videos posted on the net,
more revenue generated for creative artists, and more exposure
to a global audience for these artists,&#8221; Muller said in a blog
post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juliette Dumas, a spokeswoman for TF1 in Paris, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the ruling.
The decision can be appealed to a higher court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kim Dotcom Can Return to Luxury Mansion, New Zealand Court Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Megaupload.com founder Kim Dotcom, accused of orchestrating
the biggest copyright-infringement conspiracy in U.S. history,
can return to his leased luxury mansion after a New Zealand
court relaxed bail terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge ruled yesterday that Dotcom was no longer a
flight risk, granting the removal of electronic tags the
Internet tycoon was required to wear, according to a report on
stuff.co.nz. Dotcom had been staying in a smaller home next to
the mansion in an Auckland suburb. Ministry of Justice
spokespeople were unable to obtain a copy of the ruling for
Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dotcom, 38, was indicted in what U.S. prosecutors dubbed a
&#8220;Mega Conspiracy,&#8221; accusing his file-sharing website of
generating more than $175 million in criminal proceeds from the
exchange of pirated film, music, book and software files. He
faces as long as 20 years in prison for each of the racketeering
and money-laundering charges in the indictment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German-born Dotcom was arrested at his residence in late
January and spent four weeks in jail before being released to
await an extradition hearing, currently scheduled for Aug. 20.
When police raided the mansion in Coatesville, north of
Auckland, they seized 18 luxury vehicles, including a Rolls
Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe and a 1959 pink Cadillac. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dotcom mansion is valued at NZ$30 million ($23
million), according to an article on the stuff.co.nz website.
The property is also known as the &#8220;Chrisco mansion,&#8221; because
it was built by the founders of the Christmas hamper company,
Chrisco Hampers Australia Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dotcom last month said that New Zealand politician John
Banks, leader of the one-seat ACT party in coalition with Prime
Minister John Key&#8217;s government, incorrectly reported that
donations of NZ$50,000 from Dotcom toward his failed 2010 bid
for the Auckland mayoralty were anonymous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dotcom then lampooned the politician in a rap song he
recorded at Crowded House singer Neil Finn&#8217;s recording studio in
Auckland, along with an accompanying music video. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;IBM Sets Guidelines to Prevent Data Loss on Employees&#8217; Devices &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)&#8217;s &#8220;bring your own
device&#8221; policy has some downsides, Jeanette Horan, the
company&#8217;s chief information officer, said in an interview
published in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#8217;s
Technology Review magazine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said many employees, who are using their own
smartphones and tablets, were &#8220;blissfully unaware&#8221; of
potential security risks some popular apps could pose, according
to Technology Review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, based in Armonk, New York, has set up guidelines for
apps that should be avoided, including public file-transfer
services Horan said could potentially let confidential company
information out for public viewing, Technology Review reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All employee-owned devices used to access IBM networks must
be configured by the company&#8217;s information-technology department
so the memory can be purged remotely if the device is stolen,
Horan told Technology Review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ownership Claim for &#8216;Hon&#8217; Mark All a Mistake, Festival Head Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though Baltimore restaurateur Denise Whiting abandoned
her attempts to register &#8220;hon&#8221; with the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office last year, promotional material for the annual
&#8220;HonFest&#8221; celebration of Baltimore&#8217;s favorite term of
endearment warned would-be users of the term that they were in
danger of trademark infringement, the Baltimore Sun reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Festival paperwork for HonFest, which centers around
Whiting&#8217;s Caf&#233; Hon, warned that items bearing the word &#8220;hon&#8221;
without permission would be subject to confiscation as
counterfeit merchandise, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lisa Davis, who headed &#8220;HonFest,&#8221; told the Sun it was all
a mistake and said the warning was included because she hadn&#8217;t
noticed it was still included in the promotional material. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tissue Paper Rings Violate Olympics Marks, London Florist Warned &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A London florist was told her display of five tissue paper
rings was a trademark violation and that she could be sued by
the committee organizing the London 2012 Olympic Games and Coca-Cola Co., the games&#8217; sponsor, This Is Staffordshire news website
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The florist said she had only intended to &#8220;help people get
into the Olympic spirit,&#8221; and &#8220;was just trying to support&#8221;
her nation&#8217;s team rather than advertise her own products,
according to the website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the London Organizing Committee of the
Olympic and Paralympic Games said that each case of potential
infringement will be dealt with &#8220;on an individual basis,&#8221; but
the committee&#8217;s preference was for education about trademark
rights rather than litigation, the website reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA), the
biggest bank-card networks, produced better risk-adjusted
returns than 81 publicly traded U.S. financial firms as the two
benefit from a long-term global shift to electronic payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Visa and MasterCard outperformed every company in
the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Financials Index during the past year,
according to the BLOOMBERG RISKLESS RETURN RANKING. Visa, based
in San Francisco, returned 1.59 percent after adjusting for
price swings in the 12 months ended last week, helped by a
volatility that was lower than that of two-thirds of the stocks
in the index. MasterCard climbed 1.18 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The networks route payments and guarantee settlement, and
both have more than doubled revenue in the past six years amid a
consumer shift from cash to electronic payments that shows no
signs of abating. They don&#8217;t lend money, avoiding the profit
squeeze banks face from record-low rates, and they&#8217;re subject to
less regulatory scrutiny than lenders or insurers, insulating
their stocks from sharper price swings, analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They are very sophisticated toll collectors,&#8221; said
Darrin Peller, an analyst with Barclays Plc. &#8220;It&#8217;s a very
profitable group that&#8217;s very capable of managing and controlling
their earnings power.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mexico&#8217;s cable industry called for
the creation of a third television network, a sign that the
nation&#8217;s dominant broadcaster, Grupo Televisa SAB, is growing
more comfortable with the idea of new competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Cable Telecommunications Chamber President
Alejandro Puente, speaking at the industry&#8217;s annual gathering,
called on Mexican President Felipe Calderon to auction airwaves
to create a new broadcast network. Mexico City-based Televisa is
a member of the chamber and owns three of Mexico&#8217;s largest
cable-TV carriers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We propose that President Calderon support the tender of
a third national channel of broadcast television, which surely
would provide fresh air for our public life and would allow the
opening of greater means of freedom of expression for
citizens,&#8221; Puente said yesterday in Acapulco, Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pronouncement by the chamber, known as Canitec, follows
an opinion column in March by Televisa Chairman Emilio Azcarraga, who said his company wouldn&#8217;t oppose the creation of
multiple new TV networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azcarraga, who attended yesterday&#8217;s event, posted a message
on his Twitter account today, saying he is &#8220;in agreement&#8221; with
Canitec&#8217;s call for a new broadcast network. &#8220;Yes to the third
TV network,&#8221; he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa commands about 70 percent of Mexico&#8217;s broadcast
audience, with almost all of the rest belonging to TV Azteca
SAB. Dan McCosh, a spokesman for the smaller network, declined
to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico&#8217;s Federal Telecommunications Commission is studying
plans for an auction of airwaves suitable for TV broadcasting
after failing to agree on a plan in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa shares were little changed at 54.6 pesos today in
Mexico City. Azteca rose 1.4 percent to 8.65 pesos. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Dina Bass" date="May 31, 2012  6:44 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-31/microsoft-recruits-designers-in-race-for-windows-apps.html"><headline>Microsoft Recruits Designers in Race for Windows Apps</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is so eager to have a
panoply of applications for the next version of its Windows
operating system that it has lined up design firms, recruited
interns and sent engineers on an around-the-world road show to
help developers get them built. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG), which run the world&#8217;s
largest app stores, Microsoft doesn&#8217;t have the luxury of waiting
for programmers to come knocking when they want to create
downloadable games, productivity tools or online magazines for
its computer software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Microsoft struggles to keep up with a technology
landscape that is moving beyond personal computers into a future
defined by mobile devices, the company is under pressure to gain
a toehold in tablets. Demand for these handheld machines is
driven by apps, which Gartner Inc. predicts will generate $58
billion in sales in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be very important to have a lot of apps,&#8221;
said Bill Predmore, president at Pop, a Seattle-based company
that designs and develops apps, including a Windows 8 app for
Major League Soccer. &#8220;You&#8217;re competing with the iPad. You have
to have some compelling alternative to that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which is working on a revamped version of its
flagship software -- Windows 8 -- today released an almost-
complete iteration called a Release Preview. The company also
said for the first time that it plans to have machines with the
operating system on store shelves by year-end holidays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;From Scratch &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The machines that are most comparable to the iPad -- which
boasts more than 200,000 apps -- won&#8217;t be able to run older
Windows apps, forcing Microsoft to start from scratch. The
company is racing to fill the gap because consumers won&#8217;t clamor
for computers that lack an array of downloadable tools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows 8 is the first Microsoft operating system for
computers that use chips based on ARM Holdings Plc (ARM) technology.
These chips are widely used in mobile devices, including the
iPad. Trouble is, Microsoft&#8217;s ARM-based devices will run only
apps designed specifically for Windows 8 -- and none of the
millions of programs already available for Intel-based machines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence the app-building drive. For much of February, app
developers could come to Building 20 at Microsoft&#8217;s Redmond,
Washington campus and turn their app over to a Windows engineer
who tries it out and provides feedback. Now Microsoft has taken
that program on the road, visiting 87 cities, including New
York, Paris and Guangzhou, China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers who are earlier in the process -- those with an
idea yet no app -- can attend a different program called an App
Acceleration Lab to get advice on shaping their product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Moonlighting Staff &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another Microsoft-led effort has been in place since
September. The company has trained more than 80 design firms to
aid or build apps for developers who aren&#8217;t familiar with
Windows&#8217; new design or design in general, said Catherine Brooker, a spokeswoman for Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with Windows Phone, Microsoft encouraged its own
employees to write apps by waiving so-called moonlighting
restrictions on workers, which keep staff from writing apps on
their own time. Unlike with Windows Phone, Microsoft is not
paying app developers to build for Windows 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is also running a 12-week paid internship
program called the Foundry at its New England Research and
Development Center, NERD for short. There, 22 college students
in the program will build Windows 8 apps while getting training,
product reviews and mentorship from Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With traditional PCs, it wasn&#8217;t hard to convince developers
to build programs for Windows, the dominant operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Convincing Skeptics &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s tablet challenge is steeper. It must win over
app firms and developers that grew up building programs for
smartphones and tablets, where Microsoft has little and no
share, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s pitch: Unlike the old apps that don&#8217;t work with
some Windows 8 devices, the new ones will be available not only
to buyers of tablets, but also to the more than 300 million
buyers of Windows PCs. That won over SigFig, a maker of a
program that lets users track investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some programmers remain unconvinced of the need to make
games, magazines or other online tools for a software maker more
than two years late to the tablet market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc. (FB), the largest social network, has no plans to
make a Windows 8 app even though it makes apps for the iOS and
Android, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flipboard, whose CEO is ex-Microsoft executive Mike McCue,
isn&#8217;t planning a Windows 8 version, said Marci McCue, head of
marketing at the Palo Alto, California-based company.
Flipboard&#8217;s app, which aggregates a user&#8217;s social-networking
feeds, has built apps for the iPad and tablets that run Android. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Waiting Game &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other big app makers, including Zynga Inc. (ZNGA), PopCap Games,
Twitter Inc., Pandora Media Inc. (P) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), declined
to comment on their plans for Windows 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies such as SigFig or graphic-design software maker
Corel Corp., make apps that work well on both tablets and PCs.
For them, writing for Windows 8 is a no-brainer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other developers of tablet-focused applications will wait
to see whether enough consumers purchase Windows tablets, said
Laurent Bugnion, a senior director for European operations at
IdentityMine, one of the agencies in Microsoft&#8217;s program that is
working on Windows 8 apps for clients that declined to name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Apple fanatics, who anyway won&#8217;t touch a PC with
chopsticks, they won&#8217;t be interested,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But the
pragmatic people will probably wait for a while and suddenly
when we see a few good devices come out they will start
developing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Digital Chocolate &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix Inc. (NFLX) is another one of the companies working on
apps for Windows 8, people with knowledge of the matter said.
Some of the initial apps will be in the Windows store with the
advent of the Release Preview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile games maker Digital Chocolate Inc. also plans to
have games available for Windows 8 at launch, said Chief
Executive Officer Trip Hawkins, while declining to specify
further. Corel is working on several. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Pop started building its app for Major League
Soccer, the team and employees of the professional soccer
federation spent a day at Microsoft&#8217;s campus getting guidance
from the company, said Kaylynn Kelley, who oversees Pop&#8217;s work
with Microsoft. Pop had an engineer and a designer assigned to
handle questions, which included nighttime calls that went on
for two hours. The free app, which includes news, videos and
standings, will probably be available in the next few days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s &#8216;Handholding&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SigFig, whose app is already in the Windows Marketplace,
received &#8220;concierge-like service&#8221; from Microsoft, said Patrick Cushing, the company&#8217;s product manager for mobile. For example,
Microsoft looked over SigFig&#8217;s code and showed ways to make use
of Windows 8 features they hadn&#8217;t thought of using. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corel, which made its first program for Windows in 1984,
plans to have an app in the store in the next few days for
finding graphics and a Windows 8 Metro version of WinZip is
slated for availability when Windows 8 is released. Corel too
benefited from a lot of &#8220;handholding&#8221; from Microsoft, said
Patrick Nichols, a unit president at Corel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extra help isn&#8217;t just for big companies. Microsoft is also
assisting individual developers, such as 21-year-old music
student Grant Kot, who graduated from the Julliard School last
week. Kot had written a touch-controlled musical instrument
simulation called Grantophone for Windows Phone and Microsoft
wanted it for Windows 8. So a Microsoft developer who tries to
promote Windows met Kot in New York. He hooked him up with a
designer to advise him and got him a prototype Windows 8 tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I was pretty surprised with the amount of attention I
got,&#8221; said Kot, who plays cello. &#8220;They&#8217;re putting in a lot of
effort.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vintage credit-default swaps
index said to have contributed to JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s $2
billion trading loss is surging relative to the current index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10-year Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index
Series 9, created in 2007, increased to 168.6 basis points at
4:30 p.m. in New York, according to data provider CMA, which is
owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in
the privately negotiated market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference with the current version of the five-year
index, the Series 18 expiring in June 2017, widened to 45.2
basis points, the biggest gap since August 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traders are pushing the older gauge wider as they wager
it&#8217;s one of the bank&#8217;s positions contributing to the loss after
its chief investment office took flawed positions in credit
derivatives, wagers that were &#8220;poorly monitored,&#8221; according to
JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon. The index expiring
in December 2017 jumped 13 basis points to 139.75 on May 11, the
day after Dimon disclosed a $2 billion trading loss in synthetic
credit. It&#8217;s climbed from 111.7 on March 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News reported April 5 that London-based JPMorgan
trader Bruno Iksil had amassed positions linked to the financial
health of corporations that were so large he was driving price
moves in the $10 trillion market. The unit responsible for the
loss was valuing some of its trades at prices that differed from
those of its investment bank, according to people familiar with
the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synthetic credit products are derivatives that generate
gains and losses tied to credit performance without the owner
buying or selling actual debt. Credit swaps pay the buyer face
value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the
value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000
annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), which today unveiled
a near-final test version of its Windows 8 software, said its
goal is to have machines with the operating system on store
shelves in time for the year-end holiday season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all goes well, the Redmond, Washington-based company
will be able to put the finishing touches on the product in time
to meet a goal of holiday delivery for personal computers with
the software, Windows President Steven Sinofsky wrote in a blog
post on Microsoft&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The updated Windows software will be the first to run on
chips based on ARM Holdings Plc (ARM)&#8217;s technology and the first
designed for touch-screen control. Both changes are aimed at
capturing a portion of the tablet market, which is dominated by
Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPad. Demand for tablets has been siphoning off
customers from Windows-based PCs and curbing Microsoft&#8217;s
influence among consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on feedback from this latest test version, Microsoft
will move forward toward a milestone called release to
manufacturing, at which point computer makers will start putting
the software on their devices. Microsoft aims to enter that
final phase in about two months, Sinofsky said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft fell less than 1 percent to $29.19 at the close
in New York. The shares have gained 12 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein will testify at the insider-
trading trial of the bank&#8217;s former director Rajat Gupta, a
prosecutor said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With jurors briefly out of the courtroom today, Assistant
U.S. Attorney Reed Brodsky told U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff
in Manhattan that prosecutors would call Blankfein as their
next-to-last witness before wrapping up about June 6. Brodsky
didn&#8217;t say what Blankfein would testify about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein testified at last year&#8217;s trial of Galleon Group
LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam, to whom Gupta is accused of
leaking inside information. Rajaratnam was convicted and
sentenced to 11 years in prison. Gupta denies wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Rajaratnam&#8217;s trial, Blankfein said Gupta violated
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s confidentiality policies by allegedly telling
Rajaratnam about the firm&#8217;s earnings and strategic plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t want information about our company to get
outside before the time is appropriate,&#8221; Blankfein testified on
March 23, 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to
comment on Blankfein as a witness in Gupta&#8217;s trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defense attorney Gary Naftalis identified likely defense
witnesses, listing Gupta family members and Gupta&#8217;s personal
assistant. Naftalis also said he planned on reading deposition
testimony from Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)&#8217;s reinsurance chief, Ajit Jain, a close friend of Gupta&#8217;s. Naftalis said he didn&#8217;t know
yet whether Gupta will testify on his own behalf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Berkshire Investment &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta, who ran McKinsey  Co. from 1994 to 2003, is on
trial for leaking tips about Goldman Sachs and Procter  Gamble
Co. (PG), where he was also a director. One of the alleged tips
involved a Berkshire Hathaway investment in Goldman Sachs. Gupta
has pleaded not guilty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam and Gupta are the biggest figures yet to be
caught up in a nationwide insider-trading probe. Gupta is
charged with conspiracy and securities fraud, which carries a
maximum 20-year prison sentence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier today, a government witness testified that Gupta
joined a Galleon executive on a marketing trip to the Middle
East and was named by Rajaratnam to be chairman of a Galleon
investment fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ayad Alhadi, who was a Galleon marketing executive from
February 2008 to October 2009, told jurors about Gupta&#8217;s role in
helping Galleon recruit clients. Prosecutors offered the
evidence to highlight the business relationship between the two
men and to provide a motive for Gupta&#8217;s alleged leaks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Friend and Adviser&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He was going to be helping Galleon meet prospective
investors,&#8221; Alhadi said of a two-day trip he and Gupta took to
the United Arab Emirates beginning on March 31, 2008. Before
that trip, Alhadi said he sent an e-mail to a banker in
Switzerland calling Gupta &#8220;a friend and adviser to Galleon.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alhadi also told jurors about a meeting in Rajaratnam&#8217;s
office on March 28, 2008, where the Galleon co-founder said
Gupta, who was present, &#8220;would be the new chairman of Galleon
International&#8221; and responsible for investments outside the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think I congratulated him,&#8221; Alhadi said. Gupta may not
have been officially named Galleon International chairman,
Alhadi said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alhadi testified that after the trip, one of the sovereign
wealth funds he and Gupta met with on their Middle East trip
agreed to invest $25 million in a Galleon fund and pledged to
invest another $50 million four days after meeting them again at
Galleon&#8217;s office in New York. Alhadi described this development
in an e-mail to his Galleon superiors as &#8220;a startling
investment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He testified that in September 2008, Gupta asked for the
&#8220;contact details&#8221; of potential investors the two had met in
the Middle East. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;$400 Million &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He said he was raising a telecommunications fund with the
current or former chairman of ATT,&#8221; Alhadi testified. &#8220;He
said ATT would invest $400 million in this billion-dollar fund
if Mr. Gupta could come up with the rest of the money.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alhadi said he heard nothing more about the possible fund
after the conversation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During cross-examination by one of Gupta&#8217;s defense lawyers,
Robin Wilcox, Alhadi testified that agents with the Federal
Bureau of Investigation appeared, unannounced, at his home at 6
a.m. on Aug. 3, 2011. He later met with prosecutors and agents
two more times, he testified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Did you ever tell the government that for some investors,
having a meeting with Mr. Gupta was like having a meeting with a
rock star?&#8221; Wilcox asked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t remember saying that,&#8221; Alhadi answered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kumar Testimony &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Alhadi&#8217;s testimony, prosecutors are seeking to counter
a defense claim that Rajaratnam and Gupta had a falling out at
the time of the alleged leaks. Defense lawyers say Rajaratnam
lost $10 million that Gupta invested in a Galleon fund,
prompting Gupta to consider a lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-McKinsey director Anil Kumar may testify as early as
today, Brodsky told Rakoff. At Rajaratnam&#8217;s trial, part of
Kumar&#8217;s testimony focused on the relationship between Gupta and
Rajaratnam. Kumar has pleaded guilty to insider trading and is
testifying for prosecutors in a bid for leniency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among defense witnesses named by Naftalis were Rick Schutte, Galleon&#8217;s former U.S. president; Richard Feachem,
executive director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,
Tuberculosis  Malaria; and Gregory Orman, Gupta&#8217;s financial
adviser. Naftalis didn&#8217;t say what the witnesses would testify
about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Gupta, 11-cr-00907, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission is seeking input on whether to narrow exemptions in a
proposed proprietary-trading ban after JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
announced at least $2 billion in losses on credit derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CFTC staff members are hearing today from former Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. chairman Sheila Bair, Barclays Plc (BARC)
Managing Director Keith Bailey and Credit Suisse (CSGN) Chief Risk
Officer for American equities Dan Rodriguez at a meeting in
Washington as they prepare to craft revisions to the so-called
Volcker rule. The main U.S. derivatives regulator is among five
agencies charged with implementing the Dodd-Frank Act measure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In adopting the Volcker rule, Congress prohibited banking
entities from proprietary trading while at the same time
permitting banking entities to engage in certain activities,
such as market-making and risk-mitigating hedging,&#8221; CFTC
Chairman Gary Gensler said in his opening remarks. &#8220;One of the
challenges in finalizing this rule is achieving these multiple
objectives.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CFTC, along with the Federal Reserve, Securities and
Exchange Commission and FDIC have faced pressure to tighten the
Volcker rule since JPMorgan Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Jamie Dimon disclosed the trading loss on May 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule -- named for former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker, who
championed the idea as an adviser to President Barack Obama --
is intended to reduce risky trading by banks with federally
insured deposits and access to the Fed&#8217;s discount window.
Participants in today&#8217;s CFTC discussion include advocates for a
stronger ban, such as Simon Johnson, a Massachusetts Institute
of Technology professor and Bloomberg View columnist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Planned Before Loss &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The roundtable was planned before JPMorgan announced its
trading loss. JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. and Morgan
Stanley (MS) initially indicated they would send representatives but
later declined, according to a person familiar with the matter
who requested anonymity. The banks are members of the Securities
Industry and Financial Markets Association and International
Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc., which both sent
representatives to the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three banks have urged regulators to delay and relax
parts of the rule. The 298-page proposal was released by five
regulators in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For a lot of our clients we actually provide derivatives
especially now in the recent environment for protection on their
portfolio or providing risk-mitigating products for clients,&#8221;
Rodriguez said at the meeting. &#8220;In order to mitigate the
problems that can be caused by derivatives you need better
supervision.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Wake Up Call&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Johnson, a South
Dakota Democrat, said May 22 that JPMorgan&#8217;s losses bolster the
case for the regulations included in the Dodd-Frank measure and
serves as a &#8220;wake up call for many opponents&#8221; of the law&#8217;s
provisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All five of the regulators working on this are informed
by market events on a daily basis,&#8221; Gensler said today in a
Bloomberg Television interview before the meeting. &#8220;It is
appropriate to use these as learning moments.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bair, who pushed for strong restrictions while serving as
FDIC chairman, said regulators must ensure risk-taking is
separated from bankers&#8217; pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You don&#8217;t want compensation based on hedging profits
period,&#8221; Bair said. &#8220;They&#8217;re supposed to be hedging underlying
risk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not For Profit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview with Bloomberg TV, she added that &#8220;hedging
is not there to generate profits, it&#8217;s there to mitigate risk.
There are plenty of other ways the big corporations can make
money.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bair has &#8220;it exactly right,&#8221; Bart Chilton, a Democratic
member of the CFTC, said in an e-mail. &#8220;I think regulators do
what regulators all too often do: They over-thought Volcker. We
need some discretion, but we should lock down a few basics --
like ensuring that such discretion never permits the chance of
becoming a flawed fissure for the bankers to excavate into a
large loophole. We should also make very clear that we ban
compensation based on trading profits.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) President
Gary Cohn said the firm is limited by competitive pressures in
how much further it can cut compensation as its seeks to
increase returns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is enormous pressure out there, even in a market
environment like this, for the best people,&#8221; Cohn said today at
a New York investor conference. &#8220;There&#8217;s always a competitor or
in some cases a client willing to hire our good people.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs reduced compensation costs by 40 percent
since 2007, while its U.S. peers cut just 1 percent, according
to a presentation Cohn gave. Managing pay is one way to make up
for lower leverage as it seeks to improve returns on equity, the
firm said. Still, Cohn said the New York-based firm can&#8217;t risk
defections of its top performers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Losing those good people will have a dramatic impact on
revenue,&#8221; Cohn said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not as simple as just paying people
less and increasing dividends.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, could
have increased the average ROE over the last 13 years by about 3
percentage points if it had applied its 39 percent compensation
ratio from the last three years to the period before the
financial crisis, according to the presentation. That would more
than offset the reduction in ROE resulting from a cap of 20
times leverage, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs set aside $4.4 billion for employee
compensation in the first quarter, enough to give each of its
32,400 employees $135,123. A year earlier, the company&#8217;s
$5.23 billion first-quarter compensation expense equaled
$147,825 for each of the 35,400 employees at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm is reducing compensation costs in part by
increasing hiring in what it called &#8220;high-value locations,&#8221;
including Salt Lake City, Dallas, Singapore and Bangalore,
India. Those cities cost 40 percent to 75 percent less than New
York, London and Tokyo, Cohn said. More than a third of the
firm&#8217;s hires since 2011 have been in the lower-cost locations,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) will eventually
divest holdings in LightSquared Inc., the bankrupt wireless
network, and Ebony magazine as new Chief Investment Officer
Matthew Zames unwinds the unit responsible for the investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zames, who&#8217;s in charge of cleaning up the chief investment
office&#8217;s $2 billion trading loss, told employees yesterday he&#8217;s
moving the special investments group out of the division,
according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Zames wants
to narrow and refocus the CIO on safer holdings, according to
the person, who asked not to be identified because the changes
weren&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s shares have dropped about 19 percent since the
New York-based company&#8217;s May 10 disclosure that a bet on credit
derivatives had gone awry, and that the loss could get bigger in
the weeks ahead. Zames was plucked from the investment bank four
days later to replace former CIO Ina Drew at JPMorgan, the
biggest U.S. lender by assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The special investments unit, headed by Norma Corio, will
be placed under the company&#8217;s corporate umbrella, which includes
the CIO unit, other private-equity investments and corporate-
wide units such as human resources and treasury, the person
said. About 10 people who report to Corio will be shifted to the
corporate division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristin Lemkau, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to
comment. The Financial Times reported the changes yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holdings in the special investments group included Ebony
publisher Johnson Publishing Co. and a $150 million stake in
LightSquared, which filed for bankruptcy protection on May 14.
The unit also is one of the shareholders in a fund that agreed
to provide capital to Technicolor SA, the money-losing French
maker of film technologies where Corio is listed as a nominee
for the board of directors at a shareholder meeting scheduled
for June 20. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was plenty of debate about the
new health-care law in the 2010 congressional elections while
little, if any, on birth control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the drug industry&#8217;s trade group is finding that it
helped elect Republican lawmakers who are seeking to limit
access to contraceptives sold by its members. Even so, the drug
industry is supporting their re-elections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America,
which counts among its members four of the seven biggest sellers
of birth control drugs and devices, gave $4.8 million in 2010 to
Republican-leaning nonprofits that helped elect 23 lawmakers,
all of whom later voted to limit access to birth control and
reduce federal funding for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those companies earned $1.7 billion selling contraceptives,
potentially putting themselves in the position of hurting their
own bottom lines by backing politicians looking to eliminate a
revenue source for sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re undermining their own products,&#8221; said Shelley Alpern, vice president of Boston-based Trillium Asset
Management, whose holdings include Johnson  Johnson (JNJ), a member
of Phrma that sells birth control drugs. &#8220;It&#8217;s very disturbing.
At best case, it&#8217;s a matter of the left hand not knowing what
the right hand is doing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Eliminating Federal Funding &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug industry has many concerns in Washington besides
contraception, such as working against proposals to allow drugs
to be imported from Canada and enabling the federal government
to negotiate lower prices for Medicare recipients. Momentum for
those ideas, backed by many Democrats, stalled as the White
House negotiated with industries in 2009 for support of the
health-care law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Republican-led challenge to federal funding for
contraception emerged as part of an effort to reduce federal
domestic spending. In February 2011, House Republicans voted to
end funding for Title X, the $317 million program that provides
family-planning services, including contraceptives, to lower-
income individuals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That same legislation eliminated all federal funding for
Planned Parenthood, for which contraception accounted for one-
third of its patient visits in 2010, second only to testing for
sexually-transmitted diseases, according to the group&#8217;s annual
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oral Contraceptives &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group provided oral contraceptives to 40 percent of the
2.2 million patients who sought birth control, the report said.
Abortion procedures, which animate Republican opposition to
Planned Parenthood, accounted for 3 percent of its services, the
report stated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only seven House Republicans opposed the Planned Parenthood
funding cut and just three voted against final passage of the
measure that included the two provisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senate Republicans in March tried unsuccessfully to enact
legislation allowing employees to exclude birth control and
other health services from plans provided to workers if they
conflict with moral or religious beliefs. The measure was
blocked when all but two Democrats opposed it. The proposal was
a response to a rule from President Barack Obama&#8217;s
administration requiring health insurers to provide
contraception without charge for covered employees of
religiously affiliated institutions such as hospitals and
universities. Houses of worship were exempted from the rule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presumed Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney has
vowed to end federal funding to Planned Parenthood, while not
seeking to curb a woman&#8217;s ability to use contraceptives obtained
elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;American Action Network &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Internal Revenue Service records, Phrma
donated $300,000 in 2010 to the American Future Fund and $4.5
million to the American Action Network, which represented its
largest contribution in at least three years. The two
Republican-leaning nonprofits spent $27 million to help
candidates in the 2010 election, according to the Federal
Election Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade group also donated $3.4 million in 2010 to the
Democratic-leaning Citizens for Strength and Security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Washington-based Phrma, Matt Bennett, said
the trade association doesn&#8217;t restrict its giving to groups that
it agrees with on every issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We provide support to organizations who share our mission
of increasing access to innovative medicines,&#8221; Bennett said.
&#8220;When we work with an organization or provide support, it is
done in areas of common interest.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ensuring Access &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug industry is giving to ensure itself a seat at the
table, not to elect candidates who favor its position on every
issue, said Dan Mendelson, chief executive officer of Avalere
Health LLC, a Washington research company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Political giving is not a precise science,&#8221; Mendelson
said. &#8220;The political giving enables a voice. It does not ensure
compliance with a policy position.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the 2012 congressional races, Phrma&#8217;s PAC has given 56
percent of its donations to re-elect Republican members --
including those who supported the funding cuts, according to the
Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based research
group that tracks campaign contributions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Johnson  Johnson, Phrma members Pfizer
Inc. (PFE), Bayer AG (BAYN), and Merck  Co. Inc. (MRK) sell birth-control products
such as estrogen, IUDs or so-called morning after pills known as
Plan B, according to IMS Health, a health-care information and
services company in Danbury, Connecticut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for New York-based Pfizer, Peter O&#8217;Toole, said
the company doesn&#8217;t tell Phrma how to spend its money, including
which outside groups to support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Merck Donations &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitehouse Station, New Jersey-based Merck  Co. gave $7
million to Phrma in 2010, according to the company&#8217;s voluntary
disclosures. The company&#8217;s contraceptive product NuvaRing
brought in $486 million in revenue last year, according to IMS
Health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Merck doesn&#8217;t monitor how groups spend contributions nor
does it place conditions on its giving,&#8221; said Kelley Dougherty,
a spokeswoman. &#8220;Merck does actively monitor independent
political expenditures made by associations or other tax-exempt
groups where the issue relates to pharmaceutical policy. We do
not plan to condition our membership specifically on an
association&#8217;s decision relative to its policy on reporting
independent expenditures.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PAC Donations &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All four companies&#8217; political action committees have also
made more donations to Republican House members, including those
who support eliminating federal funding for birth-control
coverage and access, than Democrats in the 2012 election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fifth company PAC, Parsippany, New Jersey-based Watson
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI), another leading maker of contraceptives
that isn&#8217;t a member of Phrma, has given almost two-thirds of its
campaign dollars to House and Senate Republicans, according to
the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based research
group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Watson provides low-cost, generic contraceptives,
&#8220;we&#8217;re really not involved in this debate,&#8221; said Charlie Mayr,
a spokesman. &#8220;We already offer consumers a very cost-effective
option.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the remaining two companies counted among the top seven
contraceptive-makers, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) has
given a majority of its 2012 PAC donations to Democrats even as
its chairman hosted a fundraiser for Romney. Denise Bradley, a
spokeswoman for Teva, had no comment. The other company, Warner
Chilcott PLC (WCRX) of Dublin, Ireland, doesn&#8217;t have a PAC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Very Committed&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Does the pharmaceutical industry support open access to
contraceptives? Sure,&#8221; Mendelson said. &#8220;Does the
pharmaceutical industry give money to the Republican Party?
Sure. The pharmaceutical industry also supports the leadership
of the Democratic Party. That leadership is very committed to
open access to contraception.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alpern said companies need to weigh in on how trade groups
they support spend their money, especially when it could hurt
revenues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When they tell us they don&#8217;t always agree with everything
the trade association does, more and more it&#8217;s sounding
disingenuous,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Companies should be looking at their
trade associations. With all the scrutiny of companies&#8217;
political expenditures, it&#8217;s a way of doing things that isn&#8217;t
going to wash in the future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s
chairman and chief executive officer, will testify next month at
a Senate committee hearing on his bank&#8217;s $2 billion trading loss
and will be asked to appear at a similar House hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon plans to appear June 13 before the Senate Banking
Committee, led by Senator Tim Johnson, a South Dakota Democrat,
a committee spokesman said. He will also be asked to give
testimony on June 19 before the House Financial Services
Committee, a person familiar with the plans said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Jamie Dimon has accepted Chairman Johnson&#8217;s request to
testify before the Senate Banking Committee,&#8221; Sean Oblack, the
panel&#8217;s spokesman, said today in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon is under pressure from lawmakers and regulators to
explain the losses and the strategy behind them. In a May 10
conference call, Dimon called the credit derivatives trades
linked to the losses &#8220;flawed, complex, poorly reviewed, poorly
executed and poorly monitored.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson decided to push back the initial date for the
Senate hearing from June 7 to accommodate the schedules of both
parties, Oblack said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s exchange-
traded note tied to energy companies organized as partnerships
rose to a record number of shares as investors look for higher
yields with interest rates reaching record lows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares outstanding of the JPMorgan Alerian MLP Index ETN (AMJ)
climbed to 113 million on May 29. The security, the largest U.S.
ETN, has a market capitalization of $4.2 billion, which makes up
almost 24 percent of the entire ETN market. Master limited
partnerships, which trade publicly, typically invest in assets
ranging from pipelines to ships transporting commodities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand for notes tied to MLPs has surged as new
technologies such as hydraulic fracturing increase oil and gas
production, said Ethan Bellamy, a Robert W. Baird  Co. equity
analyst. ETNs tied to MLPs also benefit because they are more
tax efficient than investing directly into the partnerships
since buyers may have to file separate tax returns in each state
a partnership does business, Bellamy said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The real simple reason is yields are low everywhere else
and MLPS are still offering, depending on the product, 5 to 7
percent&#8221; in distributions, which are like dividends, Bellamy
said in a telephone interview from his office in Denver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That growth may continue since alternative securities that
track MLPs make up about 7 percent of the overall market
capitalization of the partnerships, Bellamy said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You can easily see the assets under management in all
these alternative products double or triple from here.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan ETN tracks a gauge of 50 publicly traded
partnerships, which don&#8217;t pay federal income taxes and rely on
assets, such as pipelines, to generate cash flow for taxable
payouts to holders. The note matches dividends from the Alerian
MLP Index minus a 0.85 percent management fee, according to a
prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ETNs are unsecured bank debt backed by their issuer&#8217;s
credit, unlike exchange-traded funds, which hold assets. Banks
create and redeem shares of ETNs based on the level of demand
for the securities. That demand typically doesn&#8217;t affect the
price since the ETNs track the performance of an index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merck  Co. (MRK) Chief Executive Officer
Ken Frazier said he doesn&#8217;t plan on breaking up the company by
splitting off businesses the way Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Abbott
Laboratories are doing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My philosophy is fix what is broke, don&#8217;t do the fad of
the day,&#8221; Frazier said at the Sanford C. Bernstein conference
in New York today. &#8220;I remember a few years ago when people said
it would be the diversified companies that were going to get the
premium in the market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer in April said it will sell the company&#8217;s infant-nutrition business to Nestle SA for about $11.9 billion, part of
CEO Ian Read&#8217;s plan to reduce the New York-based drugmaker&#8217;s
size. Abbott said it would split into a pharmaceuticals
manufacturer and a business focusing on medical devices, generic
medicines and nutritional drinks by year-end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck&#8217;s consumer and animal units complement its
prescription drug business, Frazier said. He also said he
doesn&#8217;t see any large deals that would create value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, New Jersey, paid $49
billion in 2009 for Schering-Plough Corp., a deal that has taken
a lot of effort to integrate, said Frazier. He said he doesn&#8217;t
plan on doing another large deal and is instead focused on
smaller, targeted biotech acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck&#8217;s animal health business had $3.3 billion in sale
last year and its consumer health unit, which sells over-the-counter medicines, generated $1.8 billion in revenue. Merck gets
85 percent of its revenue from prescription drugs and vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thai stocks will rise 19 percent in
the next year after the first monthly loss since September
dragged valuations to a four-month low and the economy recovers
from last year&#8217;s floods, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmark SET Index (SET) may climb as high as 1,350 in the
next 12 months, Sriyan Pietersz, the investment bank&#8217;s Bangkok-based head of research for Southeast Asia, said by phone
yesterday. The measure closed at 1,138.63 yesterday. Earnings
may grow 20 percent in 2013 from an estimated 15 percent this
year, he said. The SET traded at 11.4 times estimated profits in
the week ended May 25, the lowest level since February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Thai companies will be able to sustain their strong
earnings momentum in the second half, with an expansion in
private investment and consumption,&#8221; said Pietersz, who was
ranked No. 2 for Thai research by Institutional Investor
magazine last year. &#8220;Companies, especially banks, will
benefit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thailand&#8217;s industrial output rose for the first time in
eight months in April as more manufacturers returned to full
production after the worst floods in almost 70 years last year,
the government said on May 28. Gross domestic product
unexpectedly grew 0.3 percent from a year earlier in the three
months through March, after contracting 8.9 percent in the
previous quarter, the government said on May 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Little Bump&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SET Index lost 8.5 percent this month to yesterday on
concern the European debt crisis and a slowing Chinese economy
will curb global growth. The gauge dropped 1.2 percent to
1,124.64 at 11:02 a.m. in Bangkok. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overseas investors sold a net $497 million baht of Thai
equities this month through May 29, poised for the first monthly
selloff since November, according to data from the Stock
Exchange of Thailand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Thai equities hit a little bump as the ongoing crisis in
Europe and problems in China trigger the sale of riskier assets
worldwide,&#8221; Chakrit Puechpan, head of domestic equity
department at MFC Asset Management Pcl (MFC), which oversees about $9
billion of assets, said by phone yesterday. &#8220;They will rally
again as economic fundamentals and corporate earnings are very
solid.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pietersz joins Mark Mobius, chairman of Franklin
Templeton&#8217;s Emerging Markets Group, and Kasikorn Securities Co.
Ltd. in favoring Thai equities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Buy Banks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobius, who oversees about $50 billion of assets, said last
month he is &#8220;overweight&#8221; Thai shares, while Kavee Chukitkasem,
an investment strategist at Kasikorn, predicted on April 27 the
stock index may rise to 1,350 in the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy shares of banks and property
companies, which may lead a rebound in the benchmark index as
loan growth accelerates and rising incomes increase demand for
residential property, Pietersz said. He recommended investors
avoid retailers and consumer-goods producers, as their
valuations are &#8220;overly stretched.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SET Commerce Index has climbed 38 percent this year,
the largest gain among 27 industry groups, after advancing 40
percent in 2011. The gauge trades at 27.2 times estimated
earnings, more than double the multiple on the SET Index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Political Tension &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SET Index has gained 9.7 percent this year on
speculation a surge in government spending after the floods
would bolster investment and consumption. The gauge trades at
11.5 times estimated earnings, compared with the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index&#8217;s 9.6 times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra pledged in January to
spend 350 billion baht ($11 billion) on infrastructure, while
the Bank of Thailand cut interest rates by half a percentage
point since November to spur economic growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should use any decline in share prices prompted
by recent political tension as a chance to buy Thai stocks,
according to Pietersz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I see more political noise, but not a risk,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thai opponents of exiled former leader Thaksin Shinawatra
rallied outside Parliament in Bangkok overnight to thwart
efforts to exonerate him of a corruption conviction, in one of
the biggest challenges to his sister&#8217;s nine-month-old
government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 7,000 members of The People&#8217;s Alliance for Democracy,
whose yellow-shirted royalist members helped remove two Thaksin-linked governments, would gather outside Parliament House,
organizer Tul Sitthisomwong said by phone yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protest risks reigniting a feud that has led to violent
street protests claiming more than 100 lives since his ouster. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the day in May 2008 when Mark Tercek, a managing director at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), got a
cell-phone call from a headhunter informing him that he&#8217;d likely
gotten the job of running the Nature Conservancy, he was so
excited that he backed his Jeep Grand Cherokee into a tree,
shattering the back window. Anxious that gouging a tree might be
a bad omen, he jumped out to see how bad it was. To his relief,
he&#8217;d done far more damage to his vehicle than the tree. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tercek spent more than two decades on Wall Street, and none
of those years in green think tanks or chained to a bulldozer
blocking a logging road. As a city kid from Cleveland who camped
and hiked infrequently, he had come late to the joys of the
outdoors. Now, it appeared, he&#8217;d be leading the world&#8217;s largest
conservation organization, which has a million members, chapters
in 50 states and 34 countries, and more than $5&#160;billion in
assets, Bloomberg Businessweek reports in its June 4 issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Conservancy&#8217;s $1&#160;billion in annual income dwarfs all
conservation competitors. And it had been run, for most of its
60-year history, by lifelong conservationists. Tercek had big
ideas about how to radically change the traditional approach to
solving environmental problems and improving the Conservancy&#8217;s
operations, but would career greenies listen to the theories of
a banker? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) trader Bruno Iksil, known as the London Whale because his bets this year were
so large, has been a leviathan of a risk-taker since at least
2010, a person with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iksil&#8217;s value-at-risk, a measure of how much a trader might
lose in one day, was typically $30 million to $40 million even
before this year&#8217;s buildup, said the person, who wasn&#8217;t
authorized to discuss the trades. Sometimes the figure, known as
VaR, could surpass $60 million, the person said. That&#8217;s about as
high as the level for the firm&#8217;s entire investment bank, which
employs 26,000 people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigators are examining how long senior executives knew
about Iksil&#8217;s swelling bets at the chief investment office
before losses approached $2 billion. One focal point is why the
formula used to calculate Iksil&#8217;s VaR was altered early this
year, cutting the reported risk by half. The change followed an
internal analysis in late 2011 and was approved by top risk
executives, said a person close to the bank. About the same
time, half a dozen managers typically involved in such decisions
moved to new jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If it was something that had that large an impact, it
would have to be agreed to at the very-most-senior level within
risk management,&#8221; probably including the bank&#8217;s chief risk
officer, said Steve Allen, a former head of risk methodology for
JPMorgan who retired in 2004. &#8220;You&#8217;re not going to make a
change of that magnitude on the basis of one risk manager.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unexplained Change &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan hasn&#8217;t detailed how or why the New York-based
lender altered the VaR formula. The changes -- and the timing of
the firm&#8217;s disclosures about them -- are the focus of an inquiry
by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Chairman Mary Schapiro told a congressional panel on May 22. Shares of the
bank, the biggest in the U.S., have tumbled 25 percent since
April 5, when Bloomberg News first reported on Iksil&#8217;s trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56, has since
suspended the bank&#8217;s $15 billion share buyback program and
replaced executives who oversaw the errant trades. Dimon has
said the losses could grow and that it might take the rest of
the year to liquidate trades at the unit, which is charged with
managing the bank&#8217;s idle cash to earn a profit while minimizing
the company&#8217;s risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iksil, who joined JPMorgan in 2005 according to U.K.
regulatory records, was given more leeway than many traders
because he produced outsized gains during previous years --
including more than $100 million in 2011, said a person close to
the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Whale Watching &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His bosses may not have understood the complexity of his
trades, said the person, who asked for anonymity because the
information hasn&#8217;t been released publicly. Executives and risk
managers in the chief investment office were aware of Iksil&#8217;s
positions because they met every Thursday morning to discuss the
unit&#8217;s trades, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iksil was assigned to devise hedges and make trades to
counter the risk that a faltering economy might lead to a surge
in losses on corporate loans or bonds. By 2010, the VaR on his
trading book was about half of that for JPMorgan&#8217;s entire chief
investment office, which at the time also oversaw more than $300
billion of securities, according to a person with direct
knowledge of the CIO&#8217;s operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VaR represents the maximum JPMorgan traders would expect to
lose on 95 out of 100 trading days, according to quarterly
filings with regulators. It is calculated daily, and the average
for a quarter is reported in regulatory filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Flawed Formulas &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there&#8217;s no estimate of what the losses might be on
the worst days, a string of daily losses exceeding the VaR can
be a warning that the formulas are flawed or that markets have
turned unusually volatile. Dimon had encouraged the once-conservative CIO operation, run by Ina Drew, to boost profit by
buying higher-yielding assets such as structured credit,
equities and derivatives, Bloomberg News reported on April 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks and their traders have multiple computer models to
estimate potential swings in profits and losses. Value-at-risk
is among the most crucial because it&#8217;s reported to investors in
filings that are reviewed by the SEC. Any changes to the model&#8217;s
characteristics are supposed to be disclosed, Schapiro said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank produces more than half a dozen VaR barometers for
different parts of the firm, and the chief investment office
gets one of its own. Toward the beginning of this year, the bank
changed the mathematical formulas used to calculate VaR for that
unit, Dimon said on May 10, without elaborating on the reasons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quarterly Rise &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new formula showed average VaR for the chief investment
office stood at $67 million, according to a regulatory filing on
April 13, the day JPMorgan reported first-quarter results. When
JPMorgan reverted to the old model, it showed the average VaR
was $129 million, and that the figure ballooned to $186 million
at the end of the period, a May filing showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We implemented a new VaR model, which we now deemed
inadequate,&#8221; Dimon said. &#8220;We went back to the old one, which
had been used for the prior several years, which we deemed to be
more adequate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iksil alone may have amassed a $100 billion position this
year in contracts on one credit-derivative index, counterparts
at hedge funds and rival banks said in April. The holdings
amounted to tens of billions of dollars under the firm&#8217;s own
math, a person familiar with JPMorgan&#8217;s view has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VaR changes may have allowed or encouraged Iksil or
other traders in the chief investment office to take bigger
positions, said David Hendler, an analyst at CreditSights Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s possible that when the new model said, &#8216;Hey, we can
put on more risk,&#8217; they did,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And then when they
went back to the old model, they saw, &#8216;Oh my God, our risk is
much higher than we thought.&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Internal Probe &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank is conducting its own probe into the CIO&#8217;s losses
and plans to report on the findings, said Kristin Lemkau, a bank
spokeswoman. Dimon is scheduled to testify June 13 before the
Senate Banking Committee, and will be asked to appear June 19 at
the House Financial Services Committee, a person familiar with
the plans has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon didn&#8217;t mention Iksil by name on May 10, when the CEO
first disclosed the losses and the decision to revert to the old
version of VaR. &#8220;There are constant changes and updates to
models, always trying to get them better than they were
before,&#8221; Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, such updates typically occur no more than once
a year, said a former JPMorgan risk manager who asked not to be
identified to avoid alienating the bank. Lesley Daniels Webster,
a former head of market and fiduciary risk management at
JPMorgan, said that new models are usually tested &#8220;in
parallel&#8221; with old models for about three months to make sure
they&#8217;re working properly before being used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Signing Off &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a formal approval process for the adoption of a
new model,&#8221; said Daniels Webster, who retired in 2005 and runs
her own risk-management firm, Daniels Webster Capital Advisors,
based in Naples, Florida. &#8220;Somebody has to sign off.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allen, the other former JPMorgan risk manager, said that a
model change big enough to reduce the VaR by half probably would
need approval from the chief risk officer, especially if a
trading book is unusually large. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon said in April 2009 that he doesn&#8217;t pay much attention
to VaR and has criticized the gauge when analysts questioned him
in past years about its levels. VaR is &#8220;a very imperfect
number&#8221; that &#8220;bounces around all the time,&#8221; he said on a Jan.
18, 2006, conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Washington Warning &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. banks were warned last year by the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency to closely scrutinize the
possibility that computer models used to calculate VaR might not
be properly designed or calibrated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The use of models invariably presents model risk, which
is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based
on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports,&#8221; according
to the April 4, 2011, document from the OCC, which supervises
JPMorgan&#8217;s primary banking subsidiary. &#8220;Model risk can lead to
financial loss, poor business and strategic decision-making or
damage to a bank&#8217;s reputation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s team that handled such matters was on the verge
of a shakeup that involved at least six management changes in
late 2011 or early this year within the chief risk office, chief
investment office and treasury. The personnel changes may have
contributed to lapses in risk management, said the person close
to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;People in Motion &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barry Zubrow, 59, a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. veteran who
was hired by JPMorgan in November 2007, served as chief risk
officer through Jan. 12, when Dimon shifted him to oversee
regulatory, public relations and lobbying strategy. His
replacement was John Hogan, 45, who oversaw risks within
JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bank during the U.S. subprime mortgage
crisis in 2008 and 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hogan, after being named chief risk officer in mid-January,
didn&#8217;t announce his new management team -- including his own
successor -- until Feb. 13, so he was doing both the new job and
the old job for about a month, according to the person close to
the bank. A chief risk officer signed off on the VaR change,
which took effect in January, the person said. It couldn&#8217;t be
determined whether Zubrow or Hogan signed off, and neither
responded to phone calls seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new team included Irvin Goldman, 51, who had been
overseeing strategy at the chief investment office, as the
unit&#8217;s chief risk officer. He replaced Peter Weiland, who
remained with the bank as head of market risk for the investment
office, reporting to Goldman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Family Tie &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman, Zubrow&#8217;s brother-in-law, had been fired in 2007 by
Cantor Fitzgerald LP for money-losing bets that led to a
regulatory sanction of the firm, Bloomberg reported on May 20.
Regulators didn&#8217;t accuse Goldman of wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evan Kalimtgis, 42, who co-headed risk management for the
$355.6 billion book of securities in the investment office, quit
in March after learning that Goldman would become his new boss,
people with knowledge of the move said. Kalimtgis, who until
mid-2011 was overseeing market risks in the London CIO office
where Iksil worked, said he couldn&#8217;t comment. Keith Stephan
succeeded Kalimtgis as head of market risk in the London office,
two people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Abrahams, who had been head of quantitative research
and model oversight at JPMorgan, reporting to the chief risk
officer, retired in May, according to his profile on the website
LinkedIn. He&#8217;s now a founder at Gnana Inc., according to
LinkedIn. He&#8217;s also an instructor at Stanford University near
Palo Alto, California, where in January he taught a seminar on
&#8220;model risks, safeguards and new directions,&#8221; according to the
school&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Leaving the Bank &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abrahams said in an interview that he started planning
career changes in the latter part of 2011, and his departure had
&#8220;nothing to do with the current news story.&#8221; He said that
while his official retirement date was in May, he wasn&#8217;t
physically present after the end of 2011. Abrahams was succeeded
by C.S. &#8220;Venkat&#8221; Venkatakrishnan, according to a Feb. 13 memo
from Hogan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Bonocore, 44, a former finance chief in the CIO who
was promoted in November 2010 to become the bank&#8217;s treasurer,
quit in October to join Citigroup Inc. (C) The job stood open for
five months until prime-brokerage and futures chief Sandie O&#8217;Connor, 45, was promoted to the post in March. The treasurer
shares responsibility with the chief investment officer for
managing &#8220;capital, liquidity and structural risks of the
firm,&#8221; according to JPMorgan&#8217;s annual report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drew, 55, who as chief investment officer oversaw Iksil&#8217;s
trades, resigned on May 14 and was replaced by Matthew Zames,
41, who had headed fixed-income trading. Goldman was stripped of
his duties in May, though he remains at the firm, according to a
person familiar with the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Internal Memo &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan named Ashley Bacon as deputy chief risk officer,
in addition to his role as head of firmwide market risk,
according to a memo today to employees from Hogan. &#8220;He will
partner with me to review and assess firmwide risk and risk
governance,&#8221; Hogan wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Dimon held the May 10 conference call to announce the
derivatives-trading losses, Hogan sent an internal memo urging
his employees in the risk department to &#8220;remain vigilant.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our focus is no surprises,&#8221; Hogan wrote. &#8220;Remember, as
an independent oversight function, it&#8217;s our responsibility to
escalate early and often.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Credit Derivatives &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That oversight extends to JPMorgan&#8217;s chief investment
office, which in 2008 and 2009 started expanding its use of
credit derivatives to hedge its holdings against an economic
slump. The shift was led by Drew&#8217;s top deputy in London,
Achilles Macris, who in turn oversaw Iksil&#8217;s boss, Javier Martin-Artajo, people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iksil was assigned to design those hedges and execute
trades. Last year, Iksil made a bearish bet on an index of
credit derivatives, speculating that one or more companies
included in the index would default before trading contracts
expired in December, according to market participants at hedge
funds and banks. Some hedge funds were taking the opposite view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iksil&#8217;s bet won out, and the hedge funds faced losses of 25
percent, when American Airlines parent AMR Corp. filed for
bankruptcy less than a month before the insurance-like swaps
matured, the market participants said. The trades were made in
so-called tranches of the index, which concentrates risks on the
member companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Various Complaints &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traders sometimes complain about VaR models that &#8220;have
adverse effects on the business,&#8221; and they&#8217;re &#8220;less likely to
challenge an outcome that results in an advantage for them,&#8221;
according to the OCC supervisory guidance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency said May 14 that it was examining the losses at
JPMorgan, including &#8220;details related to the specific
transactions as well as the surrounding risk-management
processes that resulted in this unexpected loss.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve, as JPMorgan&#8217;s holding-company
supervisor, is studying organizational issues around the trading
loss to assure that they aren&#8217;t repeated in other areas of the
firm, Barbara Hagenbaugh, a spokeswoman for the central bank,
said on May 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common reasons for altering a VaR model include
changes in the range of historical pricing data used to estimate
the potential swings and revisions in the amount of hedging
activity that&#8217;s allowed as an offset, said Daniels Webster, the
ex-JPMorgan risk manager. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the toughest questions about the VaR changes may be
reserved for the executives who approved them, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is no one VaR model out there that is recognized as
the sine qua non,&#8221; Daniels Webster said, invoking the Latin for
something indispensable or essential. &#8220;So we&#8217;re dealing with
judgment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the largest U.S.
oil company, plans to build factories that produce ethylene and
plastics in Texas, joining a growing group of competitors racing
to use U.S. natural gas to make chemicals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new plant at the company&#8217;s site in Baytown would produce
1.5 million metric tons of ethylene annually starting in 2016,
pending regulatory approvals, Irving, Texas-based Exxon said
today in an e-mailed statement. The gaseous chemical would be
used to make 1.3 million metric tons of polyethylene plastic at
two plants to be built in nearby Mont Belvieu, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Houston-area plants would &#8220;significantly&#8221; increase
exports of plastics, Exxon said in the statement. Chevron
Phillips Chemical Co. is planning a $5 billion ethylene project
at its Baytown site and Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) is also expanding to
use more gas-based raw materials that provide a cost advantage
over oil-based production in Europe and Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The proposed investment reflects Exxon Mobil&#8217;s continued
confidence in the natural-gas-driven revitalization of the U.S.
chemical industry,&#8221; the company said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas prices in New York fell to a 10-year-low in April and
have pushed costs for U.S. chemical producers to the lowest
outside of the Middle East, Cynthia Werneth, an analyst at
Standard  Poor&#8217;s, said on a conference call today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exxon&#8217;s Largest &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ethylene plant would be Exxon&#8217;s largest in the U.S. and
its first in the country since 1997. The company has two
ethylene plants in Baytown with capacities of 1 million tons and
1.2 million tons; a 800,000-ton capacity factory in Beaumont,
Texas; and 1-million-ton plant in Baton Rouge, Louisiana,
according to Exxon&#8217;s 2011 Financial  Operating Review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The polyethylene plants would increase by 34 percent
Exxon&#8217;s U.S. output of the resin used to make products such as
food packaging and plastics bags, based on data in the company
review. Globally, Exxon&#8217;s ethylene capacity would increase 17
percent and its polyethylene production would rise 18 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project would create 10,000 construction jobs and would
boost Exxon&#8217;s Baytown workforce of 6,500 by about 350, the
company said. Margaret Ross, a company spokeswoman, declined to
say in a telephone interview how much the project would cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon filed applications with Texas and U.S. environmental
regulators on May 22. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart (WMT) Stores Inc. Chief Executive
Officer Mike Duke told employees and shareholders at the
company&#8217;s annual meeting today that the retailer, whose
executives are accused of bribing Mexican officials, is
committed to ethical behavior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking before 14,000 people in Fayetteville, Arkansas,
Duke addressed an ongoing bribery investigation by the U.S.
Justice Department and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
He said the world&#8217;s largest retailer was built by founder Sam
Walton on a foundation of ethics and trust and will continue to
behave that way. His comments followed similar statements by Rob Walton, the company&#8217;s chairman and son of the founder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time since acknowledging an investigation
into bribery allegations in April, Duke spoke about the
accusations and demanded ethical behavior from his company. He
said Wal-Mart is investigating the allegations and will get to
the bottom of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s either the right thing to do or we won&#8217;t do it at
all,&#8221; Duke said. &#8220;This is my standard. This was Sam Walton&#8217;s
standard. We will not accept anything less than integrity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart fell 0.4 percent to $65.55 at the close in New
York. The shares have gained 9.7 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stock exchanges proposed changes
to trading curbs meant to safeguard equity markets, revising an
April 2011 proposal for a system that would prevent trades at
prices outside a certain band. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The curbs would give markets that list companies and
exchange-traded funds new flexibility to pause stocks when doing
so may damp volatility, according to a Securities and Exchange
Commission filing dated May 24 from venue operators including
NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ) The system would be
implemented in February as a one-year pilot program, said the
group, which includes the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority, overseer of more than 4,400 brokers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators and exchanges introduced curbs after the May
2010 rout known as the flash crash to halt individual stocks
when they rise or fall at least 10 percent. Exchanges asked for
permission 13 months ago to test a replacement system known as
limit-up/limit-down, and the May 24 filing augmented that
request in response to comments from brokers and other market
participants. The 2011 proposal was never implemented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The plan will reduce the negative impacts of sudden,
unanticipated price movements in NMS stocks, thereby protecting
investors and promoting a fair and orderly market,&#8221; the
exchanges and Finra wrote, using the acronym for national market
system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC must approve the filing before it can be
implemented. The regulator must make a decision by May 31,
according to an SEC notice when a ruling was last delayed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;After JPMorgan Loss, U.S. Regulator Ponders Tighter Volcker Rule &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main U.S. derivatives regulator will discuss whether to
tighten exemptions to a proposed ban on proprietary trading
after JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) announced at least $2 billion in
credit-derivatives trading losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission gathered
input yesterday for a final rule, required from five U.S.
regulators under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. Sheila Bair, former
chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., Keith Bailey,
managing director at Barclays Plc (BARC), and Peter Antico, managing
director at Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), were scheduled to discuss
exemptions from the ban for hedging and market-making. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators including the Federal Reserve, FDIC and
Securities and Exchange Commission have faced pressure following
JPMorgan&#8217;s announcement to tighten the so-called Volcker rule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule -- named for former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker, who
during the Dodd-Frank debate proposed limiting banks&#8217;
proprietary trading activity -- is intended to reduce risky
trades by banks that hold federally insured deposits and have
access to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s discount window. A half-dozen
participants scheduled for the CFTC roundtable, including Simon
Johnson, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, have urged a stronger ban. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) are
among banks that have urged regulators to delay and ease parts
of the rule. The 298-page proposal was released by five
regulators in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taiwan&#8217;s (TWGDCONY) Cabinet Agrees to Revise Capital-Gains Tax; Stocks Drop &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taiwan&#8217;s Cabinet reached an agreement with ruling lawmakers
on a plan that will make wealthier investors and larger
shareholders pay a capital-gains tax. The Taiex (TWSE) stock index fell
the most among global benchmark indexes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the plan, investors who own more than 3 percent of
shares in a listed company or whose annual net income exceeds
NT$5 million ($167,185) must pay the tax, the Cabinet said in a
statement today. The plan was revised from the Kuomintang&#8217;s
proposal on May 28 that gave investors the option of choosing
from a flat rate or a levy on share trades that links tax rates
to the performance of the benchmark Taiex stock index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government and Kuomintang have been at odds over a tax
on securities transactions that is aimed at narrowing a wealth
gap among Taiwan&#8217;s population and bolstering government finances
as the economy slows. Taiwan has exempted securities
transactions from capital-gains taxes since Jan. 1, 1990,
according to the stock exchange&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mutual Funds Urge Regulators to Limit Advertising by Hedge Funds &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mutual funds are pushing for limits on hedge fund
advertising permitted under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups
Act, saying such ads may hurt investors and damage the entire
fund industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law&#8217;s repeal of a ban on the marketing of private
offerings to the general public may result in misleading
advertisements for hedge funds, Robert Grohowski, a senior
counsel at the Washington-based Investment Company Institute,
wrote in a blog posting yesterday. The group represents more
than 13,000 funds with more than $13 trillion in assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, securities laws generally required firms to
market non-publicly traded securities only to so-called
accredited investors with whom they&#8217;ve had an existing
relationship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a comment letter to the Securities and Exchange
Commission last week, the ICI urged regulators to impose
restrictions on private fund advertising that are at least as
extensive as those for mutual funds. The group also suggested a
ban on advertising hedge funds&#8217; performance until rules are
established governing how to calculate the returns, according to
the letter, which is posted on the ICI&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock Inc. (BLK), the world&#8217;s largest asset manager, supports
the removal of the ban on general advertising, according to a
letter the firm sent to the SEC last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICI&#8217;s position was reported earlier yesterday by Dow
Jones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Banks, Advisers Face Disclosure of Payments in Muni-Bond Deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks and financial advisers may be forced to publicly
disclose payments made in connection with U.S. state and local-government bond deals, a move aimed at revealing potential
conflicts of interest to investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, which crafts
regulations for the $3.7 trillion market, is considering whether
to require underwriters and advisers to disclose fee-splitting
agreements or other incentive payments tied to municipal-finance
deals. Banks already must begin reporting such arrangements in
August to municipalities under rules approved by regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disclosures would shed light on hidden incentives
offered to banks and advisers in exchange for recommending
transactions to government officials. The board, known as the
MSRB, said yesterday it is soliciting comments on whether to
require disclosures on Emma, a website used to make municipal-bond documents available to investors and the public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targets would include incentives for third parties who
steer business to a particular underwriter or financial adviser,
according to the statement. The move follows instances in which
U.S. regulators have focused on undisclosed payments between
those involved in municipal-finance deals gone bad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan CIO Pricing Said to Differ From Investment Bank&#8217;s &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan Chase  Co. unit responsible for at least $2
billion in losses on credit derivatives was valuing some of its
trades at prices that differed from those of its investment
bank, according to people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discrepancy between prices used by the chief investment
office and JPMorgan&#8217;s credit-swaps dealer, the biggest in the
U.S., may have obscured by hundreds of millions of dollars the
magnitude of the loss before it was disclosed May 10, said one
of the people, who asked not to be identified because they
aren&#8217;t authorized to discuss the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. bank by assets is facing regulatory
scrutiny and criminal probes over losses in the CIO, which Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon pushed in recent years to make
bigger and riskier bets with the bank&#8217;s money. The loss, which
Dimon said stemmed from positions that were &#8220;poorly
monitored,&#8221; prompted calls from Congress for tighter bank
regulation and triggered criminal investigations by the U.S.
Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan, declined to comment on whether the CIO and investment
bank were using different prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All components of the synthetic credit portfolio in the
chief investment office were mark-to-market,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trades in question, made by a CIO group that included
Bruno Iksil, nicknamed the London Whale because his positions
grew so large, were on so-called tranches of credit-swap
indexes, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because JPMorgan had amassed such large positions, even a
small change in how the prices were marked may have generated a
big difference in the value of the trades, one of the people
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Nasdaq Public Safeguards in Facebook Seen as Focus of Regulators &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.&#8217;s handling of Facebook (FB) Inc.&#8217;s initial
public offering has already led to lawsuits and may cost brokers
$100 million. What Securities and Exchange Commission officials
will want to know is whether the market operator put the
public&#8217;s interest first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $16 billion IPO of the largest social networking
company, founded in 2004 by Harvard University student Mark
Zuckerberg, was supposed to be a victory for Nasdaq OMX, chosen
by Facebook over rival NYSE Euronext. The debut was anything
but, with the first day of trading on May 18 marred by delays,
mishandled orders and investor uncertainty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A review by the SEC that has yet to be completed shows
technical failures precipitated the trading issues, not a
violation of industry rules, the Wall Street Journal said May
30, citing people familiar with the matter who it didn&#8217;t name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to review issues related to the IPO and have
drawn no conclusions,&#8221; John Nester, an SEC spokesman, said in
an e-mail yesterday. Joseph Christinat, a Nasdaq OMX spokesman,
declined to comment, as did Ashley Zandy, a spokeswoman for
Menlo Park, California-based Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nasdaq OMX Chief Executive Officer Robert Greifeld
acknowledged that a &#8220;poor design&#8221; in software put the opening
auction that set the price for the first traded shares into a
loop that delayed its completion. Executives of the company,
which operates the Nasdaq Stock Market, &#8220;believed they had the
right solution&#8221; as they worked to start trading, Eric Noll, the
executive vice president for transaction services, said in a
statement provided by spokesman Robert Madden on May 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If warranted, the most likely SEC sanction against Nasdaq
OMX would be a fine, according to Thomas Hazen, a professor at
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill&#8217;s School of Law. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Dodd-Frank Exemption for Single N.Y. Bank Expected to Advance &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A New York City bank with $10.5 billion in assets would be
the sole beneficiary of a Dodd-Frank Act exemption being
considered by the House Financial Services Committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emigrant Bank, which has about $10.5 billion in assets, has
asked lawmakers on the committee to approve a change to the 2010
financial-regulation overhaul law that will save the institution
$300 million. The committee was expected to vote yesterday to
approve the change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of New York lawmakers, led by Republican
Representative Michael Grimm, have taken up the bank&#8217;s cause,
arguing that it would be unfairly punished for protecting itself
during financial stress. The measure would retroactively change
the date used to determine which institutions are exempt from
new rules on how to consider trust-preferred securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Citigroup Whistle-Blower Wins $31 Million Settlement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C), laid low by bad mortgages, was the most
bailed-out U.S. bank during the 2008 financial crisis. Whistle-blower Sherry Hunt, a Citigroup executive, detailed how the bank
continued to buy and sell flawed home loans, even into 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg&#8217;s Bob Ivry spoke with Neil Barofsky, former
special inspector general of the Troubled Asset Relief Program
and a Bloomberg contributing editor, about the bank&#8217;s mortgage
practices. The story appears in the July issue of Bloomberg
Markets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abacus Bank, 19 People Charged in Fannie Mae Mortgage Fraud &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abacus Federal Savings Bank and 19 individuals were charged
with mortgage fraud and accused of selling hundreds of millions
of dollars in fraudulent loans to Fannie Mae, Manhattan District
Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abacus, which primarily serves the Chinese-American
community, pleaded not guilty before Judge Renee A. White in
state court in Manhattan yesterday. The bank is &#8220;disappointed&#8221;
to learn of the indictment as it discovered and investigated the
issue more than two years ago, fired some employees and reported
the results to law enforcement, its regulator and Fannie Mae,
the bank said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vance&#8217;s office is &#8220;overreaching&#8221; in accusing Abacus
&#8220;when many other banks that contributed to the national
economic crisis remain untouched,&#8221; it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The district attorney called the bank&#8217;s help &#8220;too little,
too late&#8221; at a press conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loans covered by the indictment were made to 4,500
borrowers and were among about $1 billion in loans that the bank
sold to Fannie Mae, which then unwittingly packaged them as
mortgage-backed securities and sold them to investors, Vance
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charges cover activities from May 2005 to February 2010
and follow a 2 1/2-year investigation, according to prosecutors.
Eight Abacus employees have admitted their guilt in the first
indictment of a bank in Manhattan since 1991, Vance said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abacus, a full-service bank based in New York, was founded
in 1984, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is The People of the State of New York v. Abacus
Federal Savings Bank, 2480-2012, New York State Supreme Court,
New York County (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interviews &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gensler Says JPMorgan Shows Need to Finalize Reforms &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Gary Gensler
talked about JPMorgan&#8217;s trading loss and efforts by U.S.
regulators to reduce market risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He spoke with Peter Cook on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;In the
Loop.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bair Says Tighten Hedging Provision in Volcker Rule &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman Sheila Bair
discussed the Commodity Futures Trading Commission&#8217;s meeting on
the Volcker Rule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bair, who spoke with Peter Cook on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s
&#8220;InBusiness,&#8221; said compensation shouldn&#8217;t be based on hedging
profits. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Basel&#8217;s Ingves Warns Against Relying on Ratings for Risk Models &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors shouldn&#8217;t only look at credit ratings when
assessing risk and need to rely more on their own analysis, said
Stefan Ingves, the head of the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When it comes to how one looks at rating agencies,&#8221;
financial market participants &#8220;should at least not rely solely
on external ratings without making their own considerations or
judgments at all,&#8221; Ingves, who is also the governor of Sweden&#8217;s
central bank, said in response to questions in Stockholm today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating companies have come under scrutiny since failing to
identify some of the imbalances that led to the global financial
crisis. Denmark, which holds the rotating European Union
presidency, said May 21 it won backing in the 27-member bloc to
curtail the influence of rating companies and pledged to push
for more competition in the industry. Denmark also wants to
allow issuers and investors better access to suing rating
companies should they fail in their job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors in Sweden&#8217;s biggest banks shrugged off downgrades
last month by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, sending bond and share
prices higher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Ingves, &#8220;those who make decisions in the
world of banking, in the financial sector, will have to do a
bigger share of the work&#8221; in assessing risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Comings and Goings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FDIC&#8217;s Rymer to Serve as Interim SEC Inspector General, BNA Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon T. Rymer, inspector general of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., will serve as the interim inspector general for
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the SEC said in a
statement yesterday, BNA reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rymer will serve in the role at the SEC until a permanent
inspector general is on board and will continue to carry out his
FDIC duties, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noelle Maloney, who has been interim inspector general
since H. David Kotz left the SEC in January, will resume her
role as deputy inspector general, the SEC said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two Senior SEC Investigators to Leave Agency for Private Firms &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two senior U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
investigators are stepping down this month to join private law
firms, leaving vacancies atop two units formed in 2010 in an
overhaul of the enforcement division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Kaplan, co-chief of a 75-person unit that
investigates misconduct at hedge funds and private-equity firms,
will join Debevoise  Plimpton LLP in Washington as a partner on
June 5, the firm said in a statement yesterday. Thomas Sporkin,
who heads an SEC group tasked with vetting and handling tips, is
moving to BuckleySandler LLP in the coming weeks, according to a
statement by that firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC Enforcement Director Robert Khuzami enlisted Kaplan and
Sporkin two years ago as part of an effort to develop
specialized expertise and catch frauds earlier. Khuzami hasn&#8217;t
publicly announced who will fill the vacant posts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Co. (2330) fell the most in three years after Goldman Sachs Group
Inc.&#8217;s Donald Lu, the top-ranked analyst covering the stock, cut
his recommendation, citing weak demand in China and Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chipmaker dropped 6.1 percent, the most since Jan. 8,
2009, to NT$79.90 at the close in Taipei, with volume 1.7 times
the daily average over the past three months. TSMC accounted for
one-quarter of the benchmark Taiex (TWSE) index&#8217;s 2.7 percent drop
today and was the largest contributor to a 1.1 percent decline
in the MSCI Asia-Pacific Index (MXAP) as of 2 p.m. in Taipei. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semiconductor inventories will increase this quarter and
next with a potential correction in the final three months of
the year, Beijing-based Lu wrote in a report yesterday. He
reduced his share-price estimate by 16 percent. TSMC, whose
clients include Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) and Broadcom Corp. (BRCM), forecast
record revenue for the current quarter in April and raised its
spending budget on anticipated stronger demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;TSMC shares have rarely outperformed the market once its
utilization has surpassed 95 percent due to cyclical concerns,&#8221;
Lu wrote. &#8220;We estimate TSMC&#8217;s utilization to reach 98 percent
in 2Q12 and would wait for a better entry point.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lu cut his recommendation on the stock to neutral from buy
and lowered his share-price estimate to NT$80. He also
downgraded rival United Microelectronics Corp. (2303), which dropped
4.2 percent today in Taipei, to sell from neutral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Order Cuts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising competition and the risk of order cuts prompted
Jefferies Group Inc.&#8217;s Hong Kong-based analyst Robert Lea to
lower TSMC to underperform from hold, lowering his share-price
estimate 9 percent to NT$72. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While it is difficult to be precise about the timing and
magnitude of the order cuts, we believe it is not a question of
&#8216;if,&#8217; but &#8216;when&#8217; they occur,&#8221; Lea wrote in a May 31 report.
&#8220;Our checks suggest earlier thoughts of re-stocking have now
given way to de-stocking, as confidence in the economic recovery
has evaporated.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TSMC has a buy rating from 24 of 32 analysts whose
recommendations on the stock are tracked by Bloomberg. Including
the downgrade from Jefferies, six analysts say hold while two
suggest investors sell the stock. TSMC&#8217;s decline today takes it
10 percent below its record-high close of NT$88.90 on May 3. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When is a hedge not a hedge? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s the question regulators from the Federal Reserve to
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are confronting
after JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) reported a $2 billion trading loss
from a credit-derivatives position Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon called a &#8220;hedge.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators are under pressure to respond to JPMorgan&#8217;s loss
as they finish writing the so-called Volcker Rule, which
restricts banks' proprietary trading and is the most
controversial provision in the Dodd-Frank Act. They&#8217;re
scrutinizing the so-called hedging exemption in the proposed
regulation and probably will narrow the exceptions for trades
banks say are designed to mitigate risk, according to two people
familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s loss &#8220;will reinforce the position of those who
want to be tough,&#8221; Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts
Democrat and co-author of the financial-overhaul legislation,
said in a telephone interview. &#8220;I do think it will mean Volcker
will not allow&#8221; such trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule, named for former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker, is
intended to reduce the chance that banks will put depositors&#8217;
money at risk. Dodd-Frank, signed into law in 2010, largely left
regulators to define the provisions, and in October, they
released a proposal for the rule, which is scheduled to take
effect in July. In April, the Fed said banks would have two
years to implement it, as long as they make a &#8220;good faith&#8221;
effort to comply with the ban on proprietary trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pool of Investments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the proposed version, bankers would be permitted to
do &#8220;risk-mitigating hedging activities&#8221; for &#8220;aggregate
positions.&#8221; That means using derivatives or other products to
reduce the risk of an entire pool of investments, as opposed to
a single transaction or position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan loss has ignited a debate whether aggregate or
portfolio hedging is appropriate at all and how to define and
spot these trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frank said he hopes regulators will prevent such positions,
allowing banks to hedge only against specific investments to
offset potential losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Aggregate hedging isn&#8217;t hedging, it&#8217;s a profit center,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;They are talking about making money out of it,&#8221; when
&#8220;hedges break even.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Skeptical Look &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of JPMorgan&#8217;s loss, regulators &#8220;clearly&#8221; are
looking &#8220;more skeptically at the claim about portfolio hedging
and what does the word &#8216;aggregate&#8217; in the law mean you have to
do,&#8221; said Karen Shaw Petrou, a managing partner at Federal
Financial Analytics, a Washington research firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street has aggressively lobbied against the Volcker
Rule. The five regulators implementing the provision received
over 17,000 comment letters -- the most for any part of the law.
Bankers devoted the majority of their efforts to aspects other
than hedging, such as allowances for trading by so-called
market-makers who buy and sell securities to establish prices
and whether banks can take positions in sovereign debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan employs 12 lobbyists and spent $7.6 million on
these activities in 2011, according to the Center for Responsive
Politics in Washington. Dimon led Wall Street bosses in a
closed-door meeting with Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo on May 2 to
press the central bank to ease regulations, including the
Volcker Rule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Public Challenge &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon publicly challenged Ben S. Bernanke in June 2011 on
tougher oversight, asking whether the Fed chairman had &#8220;a fear
like I do&#8221; that overzealous regulation &#8220;will be the reason it
took so long&#8221; for banks, credit and job creation to recover
from the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed spokeswoman Barbara Hagenbaugh declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The KBW Bank Index of 24 financial stocks has dropped 14
percent (BKX) since July 2010, the month Dodd-Frank was passed,
compared with a 16 percent gain in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
Index of stocks. JPMorgan shares have underperformed both,
tumbling 21 percent to $31.93 on June 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank lobbyists now say they&#8217;re on hold in reaction to the
attention JPMorgan has attracted. Their complaints may only
strengthen the call for tougher rules, said Oliver Ireland, a
partner at Morrison  Foerster LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The problem with this event is it doesn&#8217;t do the
industry&#8217;s credibility any good, so it&#8217;s not clear the industry
pushing a lot harder now would do any good,&#8216;&#8216; Ireland said. &#8216;&#8216;It
may create a backlash.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Egregious Mistakes&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, who asked regulators in a February letter to loosen
up their definition of portfolio hedging, said on a May 10 call
with analysts that JPMorgan&#8217;s chief investment office made
&#8216;&#8216;egregious mistakes&#8217;&#8217; by taking flawed positions on synthetic
credit. He previously pushed the unit, which oversees about $360
billion, to seek profit by speculating on higher-yielding
assets, ex-employees said in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The positions were &#8216;&#8216;done with the intention to hedge the
tail risk for JPMorgan&#8217;&#8217; and could result in an additional $1
billion loss or more as they&#8217;re wound down, Dimon said. &#8216;&#8216;But I
am telling you it morphed over time; and the new strategy, which
was meant to reduce the hedge overall, made it more complex,
more risky, and it was unbelievably ineffective.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan profited in 2011 by betting that credit conditions
would worsen. Then in December, the European Central Bank
provided long-term loans to euro-zone banks, igniting a bond
rally and leaving JPMorgan&#8217;s bearish bets vulnerable. So the
chief investment office made offsetting bullish investments
using credit-default-swap indexes that are thought to expire at
the end of 2017, according to market participants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bearish Trade &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The office put on another bearish trade to protect against
short-term losses using contracts due in 2012, market
participants said. Losses may have mounted when prices between
the two indexes became distorted because JPMorgan was such a big
seller of insurance. The trader who built the credit-derivatives
positions, Bruno Iksil, was nicknamed the &#8216;&#8216;London whale&#8217;&#8217;
because the investments became so large. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit conditions subsequently deteriorated, and hedge
funds increased purchases of the 2017 contracts, sending those
higher than the 2012 index and boosting JPMorgan&#8217;s losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s investments can&#8217;t &#8216;&#8216;be described in any way
as a hedge,&#8221; Michael Platt, co-founder and CEO of BlueCrest
Capital Management LLP, said in a May 21 interview with
Bloomberg Television. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s a trading loss. They
deliberately put the positions on. The London whale, who has
subsequently been harpooned, put the positions on.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geneva-based BlueCrest manages $32 billion and took a
&#8220;small&#8221; position against JPMorgan, Platt said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gone Too Far &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Gary Gensler and U.S. Securities  Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro both acknowledged May 22 the difficulty regulators face
in allowing some risk-mitigating hedging and then trying to
determine when it&#8217;s gone too far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The challenge when somebody uses a word like &#8216;portfolio
hedging&#8217; is that it can mutate and morph into many things beyond
hedging specific positions,&#8221; Gensler said May 21, 10 days
before the CFTC held a round-table discussion about narrowing
exemptions in the Volcker Rule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An administration official told reporters on May 22 that
regulators will use the JPMorgan loss as a real-life example to
inform the final rule. Regulators feel pressure to react and
will scrutinize the hedging exemption, according to another
person who works for an agency involved in the writing of the
law who wasn&#8217;t authorized to speak publicly and declined to be
identified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unpopular Regulations &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More stringent regulations are sure to be unpopular with
bankers. &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t want to make a big change based on one
event,&#8221; said Tim Ryan, president and CEO of the Securities
Industry and Financial Markets Association, Wall Street&#8217;s main
lobbying group. &#8220;This is a complicated proposal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers are using JPMorgan&#8217;s loss for &#8220;political
expediency,&#8221; and it&#8217;s unlikely that portfolio hedging actually
will be banned, predicted Douglas Landy, a partner at Allen 
Overy LLP in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks do need the ability to mitigate risks in their
portfolio using derivatives, said Ernest Patrikis, a partner at
White  Case LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s insanity to think that they shouldn&#8217;t be doing it,&#8221;
said Patrikis, former general counsel at the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York. Regulators may consider options such as
forcing financial institutions to &#8220;demonstrate more fully&#8221;
their positions or restricting how they can hedge, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prohibit Trades &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Stability Oversight Council, created by Dodd-Frank and led by Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner,
discussed JPMorgan&#8217;s loss and the Volcker Rule at a May 22
meeting, Treasury spokesman Anthony Coley said. It&#8217;s
&#8220;premature&#8221; to conclude whether the rule &#8220;would have
prohibited these trades and the hedging activity&#8221; the bank
conducted, Bryan Hubbard, a spokesman for the comptroller&#8217;s
office, said May 14 in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senators Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, and Carl Levin,
a Michigan Democrat, who co-wrote the Volcker provision, said
JPMorgan&#8217;s trading losses underline why hedging on a portfolio
basis should be barred in the final version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pressure from lobbyists during the rule-making process
gave rise to regulatory loopholes that would allow proprietary
trading to be hidden within market-making, risk-mitigating
hedging and wealth management, among other areas,&#8221; the senators
said in a May 17 letter to the Fed and other regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate Banking Committee has begun hearings on JPMorgan
and its implications for regulatory changes. The bank regulators
and Neal Wolin, Treasury Department deputy secretary, will
testify on June 6; Dimon will testify June 13. Dimon also will
appear before the House Financial Services Committee on June 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main impact of JPMorgan&#8217;s sour trades will be to speed
up work on finalizing the Volcker rule, said Brian Gardner,
senior vice president in Washington at investment bank Keefe
Bruyette  Woods Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators &#8220;are under the gun to finish&#8221; in a way that is
&#8220;totally unreasonable, which is to make sure there are no
losses at banks,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They&#8217;ve basically been assigned
mission impossible.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walton Street Capital LLC, a real
estate private-equity firm, is poised to hand back to lenders a
portfolio of West Coast industrial properties, Crain&#8217;s Chicago
reported without say how it obtained the information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walton Street, whose managing principal is billionaire Neil Bluhm, bought the properties for $2.9 billion at the peak of the
real estate market in 2007, Crain&#8217;s reported today. About $2.5
billion of loans on the Chicago-based firm&#8217;s portfolio come due
June 8, and the properties are worth so much less than the debt
that it makes sense to walk away, the newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackstone Group LP (BX), the world&#8217;s largest private-equity
firm, has acquired almost $600 million of debt on the buildings,
putting it in a position to take control if the borrower
defaults. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surrender comes just Walton Street is trying to raise
$2 billion for its seventh and largest fund, Crain&#8217;s reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iraq and Chevron Phillips Chemical
Co., a joint venture of Chevron Corp. (CVX) and ConocoPhillips (COP), signed
a letter of intent to evaluate the feasibility of developing a
petrochemical plant in the country, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company would examine building a new facility and
upgrading an existing Iraq-owned petrochemicals factory in
southern Basra province, Hanaa al-Husseini, a spokeswoman for
the Industry and Minerals Ministry, said today in Baghdad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melanie Samuelson, a spokeswoman for Chevron Philips, said
in an e-mailed statement that the company, with headquarters in
The Woodlands, Texas, wants to assess &#8220;the feasibility of
developing an integrated petrochemical complex.&#8221; Both Chevron
Phillips and the ministry declined to give additional details,
including cost estimates or dates for the project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq holds the world&#8217;s fifth-largest crude reserves and the
fifth-biggest natural-gas deposits in the Middle East, according
to data from BP Plc that also include Canadian oil sands. The
government, which depends on crude sales for more than 90
percent of its official income, wants to diversify into
chemicals production and other industries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq&#8217;s oil output is on the rebound after stagnating for
years during the rule of Saddam Hussein, ousted by a U.S.-led
invasion in 2003. The nation burns off natural gas produced in
association with crude because it lacks the infrastructure to
use it as a fuel for electricity plants or feedstock for
petrochemicals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ministry&#8217;s al-Husseini said April 9 that Shell
Chemicals Ltd. agreed in a separate arrangement to study the
feasibility of a petrochemical plant. &lt;/p&gt;
