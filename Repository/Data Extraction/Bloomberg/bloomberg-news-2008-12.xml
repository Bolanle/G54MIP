<p>Two top executives from Goldman Sachs
Group Inc.''s (GS) special situations group, which invests in
distressed businesses, have left the company, according to a
person familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>Nick Weber, 36, who was co-head of the European special
situations group in London, and Alan Waxman, 34, who helped run
the Americas team from New York, both left the company recently,
the person said. They reported to Rich Ruzika, the New York-based
global head of the group. The three didn''t respond to calls
seeking comment. </p>
<p>The special situations group is contained within Goldman''s
fixed-income, currencies and commodities division, the company''s
largest by revenue. SSG, as it''s known, became a major
contributor to revenue over the last 10 years by reaping gains on
investments ranging from a Korean liquor maker, Japanese golf
courses and a Texas wind-power company. While SSG''s overall
performance isn''t made public, some of its one-time gains and
losses are included in company disclosures. </p>
<p>Some analysts and investors expect that Goldman''s ability to
make large, illiquid investments will be limited after the firm''s
September conversion into a bank holding company and the U.S.
government''s $10 billion investment under its financial-rescue
program. While the special situations group''s sale of Horizon
Wind Energy LLC last year helped generate a $900 million profit,
falling asset values this year are expected to cause a loss from
investments in the fourth quarter that ended in November. </p>
<p>Dow Jones reported the departures earlier. </p>
