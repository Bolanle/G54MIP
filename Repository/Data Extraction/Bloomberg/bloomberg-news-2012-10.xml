&lt;p&gt;Blyth Inc. (BTH) climbed as much as 24
percent in extended trading after the maker of candles and
decorations said it reached an agreement to defer the final
closing of its purchase of its ViSalus unit until April 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares rose 6.5 percent to $28.50 at 6:03 p.m., after
advancing as high as $33.25 at 4:06 p.m. The stock had gained
3 percent to $26.77 at the close in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blyth, based in Greenwich, Connecticut, said in a statement
today that the agreement in principle is with ViSalus founders
Ryan Blair, Blake Mallen and Nick Sarnicola. A definitive accord
still must be reached, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blyth has been required to buy the remaining 27 percent of
ViSalus, a health-care company acquired in 2008, next year for
about $271 million if the unit meets certain performance goals.
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service last month cut its outlook for Blyth
to &#8220;negative,&#8221; citing a weaker core business and possible
liquidity restraints in 2013 from the potential ViSalus purchase
obligation and $100 million of notes that are maturing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company last month withdrew an initial public offering
for the unit, citing uncertain market conditions for ViSalus.
The IPO would have eliminated the requirement that Blyth buy the
remaining stake in ViSalus, the company has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer Robert Barghaus didn&#8217;t immediately
return telephone calls seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spot gasoline in California advanced
to a record against futures after Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s Torrance
refinery lost power and Chevron Corp. (CVX) shut an oil pipeline that
delivers crude to Bay Area refiners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 150,000-barrel-a-day Torrance plant is scheduled to
flare gases through today, a filing with the South Coast Air
Quality Management District showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one was injured by the &#8220;external power interruption&#8221;
at about 7:30 a.m. local time, &#8220;and refinery personnel are
assessing the situation,&#8221; Gesuina Paras, an Exxon spokeswoman
in Torrance, said by e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in Los Angeles jumped
30 cents to 75 cents a gallon above gasoline futures traded on
the New York Mercantile Exchange at 4:16 p.m. East Coast time,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That&#8217;s the fuel&#8217;s
highest premium since at least November 2007, when Bloomberg
began pricing there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbob in San Francisco gained 20 cents to 72 cents a
gallon over futures, also its highest level since at least 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron shut the Kettleman-Los Medanos, or KLM, pipeline
that carries crude from Kern County to Northern California
refineries operated by Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), Tesoro Corp. (TSO) and
Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) after detecting elevated levels of organic
chloride in the oil. The company plans to flush the 85,000-
barrel-a-day line before returning it to service, Gareth Johnstone, a spokesman at Chevron headquarters in San Ramon,
California, said by e-mail late Sept. 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnstone said in an e-mail today that the company is
&#8220;continuing to assess the situation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Phillips Work &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phillips 66 (PSX) is performing planned work at the San Francisco
refinery complex, which includes plants in Rodeo and Arroyo
Grande, California, Rich Johnson, a spokesman at the company&#8217;s
headquarters in Houston, said by e-mail. The 76,000-barrel-a-day
Rodeo plant was scheduled to shut a hydrocracker for a
turnaround, a person with knowledge of the work said Aug. 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is also expected to shut a hydrocracker at the
139,000-barrel-a-day Los Angeles refinery around Oct. 5 for a
turnaround that may last as many as six weeks, a person with
knowledge of the schedule said Sept. 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-grade, or CARB, diesel in Los Angeles rose 1
cent to 13.25 cents a gallon above heating oil futures on the
Nymex. The fuel in San Francisco was unchanged at a premium of
15 cents a gallon versus futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in Portland, Oregon,
increased 7.5 cents to 50 cents a gallon against gasoline
futures, the highest level since May. Low-sulfur diesel in
Portland increased 1.5 cents to 4 cents a gallon over heating
oil futures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intel Corp. (INTC)&#8217;s delayed delivery of
software that conserves computer battery life is holding up
development of some tablets running the latest version of
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s Windows operating system, a person with
knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft hasn&#8217;t yet approved any tablets featuring an
Intel processor code-named Clover Trail because the chipmaker
hasn&#8217;t produced necessary power-management software, said the
person, who asked not to be named since the process is private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The delay, following remarks by Intel Chief Executive
Officer Paul Otellini, who told employees in Taiwan that Windows
8 needs improvement, underscores how the Wintel alliance that
has dominated the personal computer industry for three decades
is struggling to respond to the threat of Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPad. At
stake is the chance to make up for lackluster PC buying by
capturing users who are flocking to mobile devices, snappy
applications and elegant design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The PC channel is in chaos right now,&#8221; said Alex Gauna,
an analyst at JMP Securities LLC in San Francisco. &#8220;They don&#8217;t
know what to do. They don&#8217;t know what to design for, they don&#8217;t
know what the consumers are going to buy. Tablets have stolen
their growth trajectory, plus the macro situation, plus Wintel
has made a mess of their ecosystem.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PC makers, including Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ), Dell Inc. (DELL) and
Lenovo Group Ltd. (992), are counting on the new version of Windows to
help them compete in the $63.2 billion tablet market dominated
by Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fighting Apple &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any software development delay gives manufacturers less
time to get their tablets ready for the year-end holiday
shopping season, undermining attempts to erode Apple&#8217;s 70
percent share of tablets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tablets featuring Clover Trail are the ones designed by
Intel to most closely compete with the iPad. The industry can
ill afford a slowdown in getting them into stores with the next
iPad due to be released in March or April, said Wes Miller, an
analyst at Directions on Microsoft, based in Kirkland,
Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s bad news for Microsoft and Intel because it&#8217;s not
going to present the best light on either one and it will hurt
the perception of Windows 8,&#8221; Miller said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Windows is fundamentally sound, the operating system
lacks a wide range of robust applications and PC makers haven&#8217;t
had enough time to work out kinks with so-called drivers, which
connect software to such hardware as printers, according to
Directions on Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ARM Threat &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has certified some 800 machines with the new
software, said Mark Martin, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-
based Microsoft. That includes tablets running low-power chips
with technology from ARM Holdings Plc (ARM) on a version of the
software called RT. The recent entrant to the Windows family
compounds threats to Intel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft has worked closely with Intel and our hardware
partners,&#8221; Martin said in a statement. &#8220;We look forward to the
new Atom-based offerings from Intel to complement the already
strong Windows 8 and Windows RT ecosystem.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tablets and laptops convertible into tablets built on
Clover Trail will be available Oct. 26, said Jon Carvill, a
spokesman for Santa Clara, California-based Intel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re excited about the opportunity for Windows 8 tablets
with a broad range of&#8221; Intel chips, Carvill said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
collaborated very closely with Microsoft in extensive testing
and validation&#8221; for chips, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel rose less than one percent to $22.76 at the close in
New York. The stock has declined 6.2 percent this year, while
the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index has gained 15 percent. Microsoft
fell 0.9 percent to $29.49. The stock is up 14 percent this
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;China, Brazil &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel held an event last week showcasing Clover Trail-based
tablets from Acer Inc. (2353), Asustek Computer Inc. (2357), Dell, Fujitsu
Ltd. (6702), Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo and Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) The
new devices, many of which featured detachable keyboards, have
weeks of standby time and are capable of playing high-definition
video for 10 hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, any delays caused by unfinished software or untested
hardware in tablets, laptops and desktops would be harmful to an
industry already seeing demand faltering in China and Brazil,
countries that until recently could be counted on to compensate
for weakness in the U.S. and Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refresh of the software that runs more than 90 percent
of all personal computers typically leads PC makers to stock up
on parts in anticipation of a surge in orders. Microprocessor
shipments have risen an average 6.7 percent in the quarter
before new Windows PCs go on sale, according to Mercury
Research, while PC sales gained by more than 15 percent in each
of the past two release quarters, researcher IDC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sales Decline &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time around, Intel is on pace for a sequential decline
in third-quarter sales for the first time in two decades.
Western Digital Corp. (WDC) trimmed its forecast for disk drives, and
analysts at IDC said the PC market will expand less than 1
percent this year -- the worst performance since it shrank in
2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a tough environment right now,&#8221; said Dean McCarron,
an analyst at Cave Creek, Arizona-based Mercury Research, who
has been tracking PC-industry data for two decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to McCarron, computer-processor industry sales
have posted as steep a decline only twice before in 20 years: in
2000, amid the bursting of the dot-com bubble, and in the fourth
quarter of 2008, after the financial meltdown. He estimates that
8 million fewer PC processors will ship last quarter than the
previous period, which means fewer PCs built. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chip orders are an important indicator of how confident
manufacturers are of what will happen when the new PC models go
on sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Touch Screen &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While consumers no longer stand in line outside stores to
get the latest version of Microsoft&#8217;s operating system, as they
did when Windows 95 went on sale in August of that year, even
versions like Vista -- which was panned by reviewers -- can help
the industry. PC sales jumped 15.3 percent from a year earlier
in the quarter Windows Vista debuted. Its replacement, Windows
7, prompted a 15.2 percent increase, according to IDC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In answer to the surging popularity of handheld devices led
by the iPad, Microsoft has given Windows 8 a touch-screen
interface. It has also opened up Windows to chip technology
other than Intel&#8217;s, and is plotting a move into the hardware
market itself with a line of tablets, dubbed Surface. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that may be cold comfort for Intel and other
traditional PC component makers, because in many cases tablets
rely on parts better made by competing suppliers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, tablet shipments have more than tripled in 2011
and will jump 67 percent this year, according to an estimate by
JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lateness Hurts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s obvious that tablets are taking sales from
notebooks,&#8221; said Chris Danely, an analyst at JPMorgan in San
Francisco. &#8220;We&#8217;re all buying tablets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a growing list of Windows 8-based designs to choose
from -- notebooks, tablets, laptops with touch screens, touch-
screen desktops, laptops with detachable screens that become
tablets -- PC makers have avoided snapping up their usual
stockpiles of parts until demand is more clear, according to CJ Muse, an analyst at Barclays Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Folks are sitting on their hands in terms of what they&#8217;re
building and they&#8217;re planning on air-shipping whatever starts to
sell,&#8221; said Muse. &#8220;There&#8217;s just too much uncertainty.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the main obstacle isn&#8217;t lack of enthusiasm about
Windows 8. The underlying challenge is that Microsoft and Intel
were too late with products aimed at fending off tablets, said
Doug Freedman, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel began pushing Ultrabooks, slim-line laptops that
start up instantly, last year. The devices haven&#8217;t come down in
price fast enough to woo buyers, and Windows 8&#8217;s planned arrival
Oct. 26 has given Apple and other tablet makers too much of a
head start. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re six to nine months late,&#8221; Freedman said. &#8220;They
haven&#8217;t put their best foot forward against the tablet.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) raised a $560.1
million collateralized loan obligation for Och-Ziff Capital
Management Group, according to two people with knowledge of the
deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund includes a $336.5 million slice rated AAA that
pays a rate of 148 basis points more than the London interbank
offered rate, said the people, who asked not to be identified
because the terms haven&#8217;t been announced publicly. Libor is the
rate at which banks say they can borrow in dollars from each
other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank raised a $510.7 million CLO for the firm in June,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irene Tse, the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) partner hired by JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s chief investment office to help manage the bank&#8217;s balance sheet while it boosted risk, is leaving to start a hedge fund. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tse, 43, hired by New York-based JPMorgan less than two years ago as chief investment officer for North America, is starting her own fund early next year, said people with knowledge of the matter, requesting anonymity because her plans haven&#8217;t been announced. The fund will make investments based on trends in the global economy, the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, has been curbing risk in the chief investment office after London traders built a position in credit derivatives that cost the firm $5.8 billion in the first half of the year. Tse&#8217;s departure deprives the unit of one of its most senior leaders following changes and dismissals that stemmed from the botched bets by  U.K.-based trader Bruno Iksil, nicknamed the London Whale  because the wagers were big enough to move the market. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Former Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew, 56, who retired four days after Dimon announced the initial losses on May 10, hired Tse in January 2011 to oversee North America. Tse came from Stanley Druckenmiller&#8217;s hedge fund Duquesne Capital Management LLC, where she spent three years as a portfolio manager trading mortgage securities and betting on interest rates, foreign exchange, credit, equity, commodities and structured products. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) has surpassed Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) to become the world&#8217;s second-largest technology company as computing over the Internet reduces demand for software installed on desktop machines. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Google rose 1 percent to $761.78 at the close in New York, gaining a market capitalization of about $249.9 billion. Microsoft, the world&#8217;s biggest software maker, fell less than 1 percent to $29.49, for a valuation of $247.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The milestone follows Google&#8217;s rise from a search-engine invented by two Stanford University students into an advertising powerhouse that makes the world&#8217;s most used mobile operating system and tool for digging up information on the Web. It also reflects the ascension of the Internet as the delivery channel for more of the software and computing tasks that were once left to the Microsoft-dominated PC industry. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The PC hardware business is obviously struggling,&#8221; said Martin Pyykkonen, a Greenwood Village, Colorado-based analyst at Wedge Partners Corp. &#8220;The transition here is pretty straightforward in terms of where things have moved to and certainly that&#8217;s cloud, that&#8217;s Web.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Only Apple Inc. (AAPL), the world&#8217;s most valuable company at $618.1 billion, tops Google among technology businesses. Apple passed Microsoft in 2010 on rising sales of iPhones and iPads -- devices that helped usher in a new era of computing that&#8217;s less reliant on PCs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Market Leader &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Google controls 66 percent of the U.S. search market, while Microsoft is a distant second at 16 percent, according to ComScore Inc. This year, Google is on track to displace Facebook Inc. in the U.S. as the biggest outlet for display advertising, including banner ads, according to EMarketer Inc. Google will also remain No. 1 for mobile ads in the U.S., EMarketer projects. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the same time, Google&#8217;s Android software powered 64 percent of smartphones in the second quarter, up from 43 percent in the same period a year earlier, according to Stamford, Connecticut-based researcher Gartner Inc. Apple&#8217;s software was a distant second at 19 percent and Microsoft had just 2.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft operates an online business including the Bing search engine, it still gets most of its revenue from the Windows and Office software used primarily on PCs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Windows sales have slumped as some consumers opt for tablets instead of cheaper laptops running Microsoft&#8217;s software. The next version of Windows, due Oct. 26, is designed for touch- screen technology in tablets and will power handheld devices including Surface, Microsoft&#8217;s first foray into hardware. Google has introduced its own tablet, Nexus 7. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft hit a market capitalization of more than $430 billion in July 2000, according to Bloomberg data. Microsoft fell to about $135 billion in March 2009 during the economic crisis, before recovering with the market. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Brian Womack in San Francisco at  bwomack1@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Tom Giles at  tgiles5@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The $6.5 trillion market for
investment-grade company bonds is the most attractive for risk-
averse fixed-income investors, according to Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth most-active underwriter of top-
tier corporate debt in the U.S., joins investors from BlackRock
Inc. to Loews Corp. in saying there&#8217;s still value in the bonds
even after the biggest rally in two years. The Federal Reserve
is suppressing yields on the debt with its plans to stimulate a
slowing economy, which include its expectation of keeping
interest rates near zero through mid-2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect the search for yield to intensify,&#8221; analysts
led by Charles Himmelberg wrote in a Sept. 28 report. &#8220;Recent
central bank actions have reinvigorated the relative value case
for credit within fixed income.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors funneled $2.1 billion into U.S. funds that buy
investment-grade debt last week while pulling $5 million from
those that focus on junk bonds, according to a Sept. 27 report
by Bank of America Corp. (BAC) analysts. The best-rated company notes
gained 0.6 percent last week compared with a 0.6 decline in junk
bonds, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors will be forced to look elsewhere for
duration,&#8221; the Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in the report. &#8220;To
satisfy this demand in liquid U.S. dollar markets, corporate
bonds would be the only realistic option.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Egypt&#8217;s benchmark stocks index fell
the most since July after Al Borsa reported the International
Monetary Fund delayed a visit and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut
its recommendation on eight companies in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EGX 30 Index (EGX30) tumbled 3 percent, the most among 91
gauges tracked globally by Bloomberg, to 5,650.07 at the close
in Cairo. Twenty-nine of the 30 shares in the EGX 30 declined,
while one was unchanged. Commercial International Bank Egypt
SAE (COMI), the country&#8217;s biggest listed lender, fell to the lowest
level in more than two weeks after Goldman Sachs cut the shares
to sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An IMF team postponed a visit to Egypt until December,
after the fund&#8217;s annual meeting in Tokyo, the newspaper reported
today, citing Finance Minister Momtaz El Saieed. The delegation
was due to arrive last month to discuss terms of a loan
agreement for up to $4.8 billion. The EGX 30 is still up 56
percent this year, the best performer among global benchmarks,
as political stability increased and prospects for international
aid started to materialize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market was due for a hit,&#8221; Mohamed Radwan, head of
equities at Pharos Holding for Financial Investment in Cairo,
said by phone.&#8220;Investors had expected the IMF visit delay to be
until this month. Today&#8217;s Goldman report was also a wake up call
to investors that it may be time to lock in profits.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Company earnings forecasts failed to keep up with share
gains, reducing the potential median upside for Egyptian stocks
Goldman Sachs covers to 5 percent compared with 14 percent for
shares covered in the Middle East and North Africa covered,
analysts including Dubai-based Eshan Toorabally and Matija Gergolet, wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CIB retreated 1.9 percent to 33.99 Egyptian pounds. Talaat
Moustafa Group (TMGH) Holding, the country&#8217;s biggest publicly traded
property developer, slumped 4.6 percent, the most since July 9,
to 5.2 pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The finance minister couldn&#8217;t be reached for comment, when
contacted by Bloomberg News on his mobile phone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)&#8217;s pazopanib pill
for renal cell carcinoma showed similar efficacy to Pfizer
Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s sunitinib with fewer side effects in a late-stage study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For both drugs, on average, patients survived slightly more
than 10 months without the disease progressing, according to a
study of 1,100 patients. The study, dubbed COMPARZ and funded by
London-based drugmaker Glaxo, was released today at the European
Society for Medical Oncology meeting in Vienna. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renal cell carcinoma is a type of kidney cancer that starts
in the lining of tubes in the kidney. While both drugs resulted
in side effects, some, such as fatigue and skin sores, occurred
with less frequency for pazopanib than with sunitinib, which is
marketed as Sutent, the researchers found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The side effects worse with sunitinib are the ones that
really impact patients&#8217; day-to-day living,&#8221; Robert Motzer of
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York and one of
the study authors, told reporters in Vienna today. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
complicated situation, but in general, this trial tips the
scale&#8221; toward pazopanib. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glaxo shares rose 1 percent to 1,441 pence as of 11:19 a.m.
in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pazopanib was approved for use in the U.S. in 2009 for
advanced renal cell carcinoma and is marketed as Votrient. The
study began in August 2008, before the drug was approved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An estimated 64,770 new cases of kidney cancer will be
diagnosed in the U.S. this year, and about 13,570 people will
die of the disease, according to the American Cancer Society.
Many patients don&#8217;t know they have cancer until it has reached
an advanced stage because small tumors can&#8217;t be felt and aren&#8217;t
easily detected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We anticipate that the COMPARZ data with Votrient will
likely enable Glaxo to take market share from Pfizer&#8217;s Sutent in
renal cancer,&#8221; Andrew Baum, an analyst for Citigroup Inc. in
London, said in a note to investors last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sutent had global sales of $1.2 billion in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand canceled a visa for Mike Tyson, the former heavyweight boxing champion convicted of rape,
after a charity which was expected to benefit from his visit
withdrew its support, Associate Immigration Minister Kate Wilkinson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government had granted a special direction allowing
Tyson to enter the country for a speech next month that would
benefit the Life Education Trust. The trust has made it clear it
no longer wants to have any involvement with the event,
Wilkinson said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original decision to grant the visa in light of Tyson&#8217;s
conviction and prison sentence, had been a &#8220;finely balanced
call,&#8221; Wilkinson said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tourists and business executives from
Taiwan will be allowed to travel to the U.S. without a visa for
as long as 90 days starting Nov. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taiwan will join 36 countries already participating in the
Visa Waiver Program, which provides entry without a travel visa,
U.S. officials said yesterday. China isn&#8217;t among them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement &#8220;is a major step forward in our long-
standing economic partnership with Taiwan,&#8221; Secretary of
Homeland Security Janet Napolitano, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 290,000 Taiwanese visited the U.S. last year,
spending more than $1.1 billion, according to a U.S. Commerce
Department report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision is likely to bring an increase in Taiwanese
tourism to the U.S., said Frank Wang, a press officer for the
Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in
Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely beneficial to both sides,&#8221; Wang said in
an interview. &#8220;We appreciate the U.S. announcement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike other participants in the Visa Waiver Program,
Taiwan isn&#8217;t an independent country recognized by the U.S. Since
1979, the U.S. has recognized Taiwan as being part of China and
doesn&#8217;t support independence for Taiwan, while pledging to help
maintain its defenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An official with the Department of Homeland Security, who
briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, said the 1979
Taiwan Relations Act specifies that the U.S. can treat Taiwan as
it does any other nation or government with regard to laws
concerning international programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;China&#8217;s Aware &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China doesn&#8217;t enjoy the same visa-free travel privilege
that Taiwan will now receive. A State Department official, who
briefed reporters yesterday on condition of anonymity, said that
while officials in Beijing were aware of the decision on Taiwan,
the U.S. made no special effort to consult China on the
decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geng Shuang and Gao Yuan, spokesmen for the Chinese embassy
in Washington, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to phone and e-mail
requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Visa Waiver Program accounted for 18.3 million visits
to the U.S. in fiscal 2011, or more than 60 percent of the
tourists and business travelers entering the U.S. by air,
according to a Homeland Security Department statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who hosted a travel and
tourism conference for business leaders and government officials
yesterday at the State Department, said American embassies
around the world are stepping up efforts to promote the U.S. as
a travel destination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The number of tourists bound for the United States is
growing all the time,&#8221; Clinton said at the conference. &#8220;So in
addition to trying to ease the way for Americans to travel, we
have matched that commitment with trying to ease the way for
foreigners to travel here.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Promoting the effort as a jobs initiative, Clinton said the
average tourist from overseas spends $4,000 in the U.S. She said
one American job is created for every 65 international visitors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spot gasoline in California advanced
for a second day to a record against futures after Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM) said the Torrance oil refinery may flare gases for a week
after losing power yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 150,000-barrel-a-day Torrance plant may flare sulfur
dioxide from tomorrow through Oct. 9 unrelated to a breakdown, a
filing with the South Coast Air Quality Management District
showed. The refinery had an &#8220;external power interruption&#8221; at
about 7:30 a.m. local time yesterday, Gesuina Paras, an Exxon
spokeswoman in Torrance, said by e-mail. She declined to comment
on operations once service was restored. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in Los Angeles gained
10 cents to 85 cents a gallon above gasoline futures traded on
the New York Mercantile Exchange at 1:45 p.m. East Coast time,
the highest premium since at least November 2007, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. The fuel surged 30 cents a gallon yesterday
after the power failure in Torrance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbob in San Francisco jumped 17 cents to 89 cents a
gallon over futures, also the highest level since at least 2007.
The fuel rose 20 cents a gallon yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s Kettleman-Los Medanos pipeline, which
carries crude from Kern County to Northern California refineries
operated by Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), Tesoro Corp. (TSO) and Valero
Energy Corp. (VLO), remained shut yesterday after elevated levels of
organic chloride were detected in the oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Work Planned &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phillips 66 (PSX) is scheduled to perform maintenance on
hydrocrackers at the 76,000-barrel-a-day Rodeo and 139,000-
barrel-a-day Los Angeles refineries this month, according to
people familiar with the schedules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planned work at the San Francisco refinery, consisting of
Rodeo and another plant in Arroyo Grande, California, has begun,
Rich Johnson, a spokesman at the headquarters in Houston, said
by e-mail yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s 240,000-barrel-a-day Richmond plant, the largest
refinery in Northern California, has been running at reduced
capacity since a fire Aug. 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-grade, or CARB, diesel in Los Angeles climbed
0.5 cent to 13.75 cents a gallon above heating oil futures on
the Nymex. The fuel in San Francisco was unchanged at a premium
of 15 cents a gallon versus futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in Portland, Oregon, was
unchanged at a premium of 50 cents a gallon against gasoline
futures, the highest level since May. Low-sulfur diesel in
Portland was unchanged at 4 cents a gallon over heating oil
futures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) said its Sutent pill will
continue to be the standard treatment for renal cell carcinoma
after GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) said its competing Votrient drug
showed similar effectiveness with fewer side effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients taking Sutent survived an average of 9.5 months
without the disease progressing, compared with 8.4 months for
those on Votrient, in a study of 1,100 patients, London-based
Glaxo said yesterday. Side effects such as fatigue and skin
sores occurred with less frequency for Votrient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the study&#8217;s authors yesterday suggested new patients
may now view Votrient more favorably than Sutent, which commands
about half the U.S. market for renal cancer treatments since
gaining approval in 2006 for Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker. Still, physicians and patients have experience using
Sutent and have learned to manage the side effects, said Robin
Wiltshire, head of global medical affairs for New York-based
Pfizer&#8217;s drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m confident that Sutent will remain the standard of
care,&#8221; Wiltshire said in a phone interview from Vienna after
attending the European Society for Medical Oncology&#8217;s annual
meeting. &#8220;Over time, physicians and their patients have really
learned good strategies for helping to manage the therapy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severity of side effects can be reduced through methods
such as using hand creams for the skin sores, changing diets to
manage diarrhea and reducing doses, Wiltshire said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sutent had global sales of $1.19 billion in 2011, compared
with 100 million pounds ($160 million) for Votrient, which was
approved for use in the U.S. in 2009 for advanced renal cell
carcinoma. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renal cell carcinoma is a type of kidney cancer that starts
in the lining of the tubes in the kidney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An estimated 64,770 new cases of kidney cancer will be
diagnosed in the U.S. this year, and about 13,570 people will
die of the disease, according to the American Cancer Society. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nigeria&#8217;s 10-year bonds gained on the
first trading day after their inclusion in JPMorgan Chase 
Co.&#8217;s global emerging market benchmark indexes, pushing yields
lower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on the 16.39 percent bonds maturing January 2022
dropped 16 basis points, or 0.16 percentage points, to 12.66
percent, according to today&#8217;s prices published on the Financial
Markets Dealers Association website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most-traded bonds maturing in March 2014, October 2019
and January 2022 will join JPMorgan&#8217;s GBI-EM indexes between
Oct. 1 and Dec. 3, Giulia Pellegrini, the bank&#8217;s London-based
sub-Saharan Africa economist, wrote in a note to clients Sept.
25. JPMorgan first disclosed the plans in August after central
bank Governor Lamido Sanusi&#8217;s decision last year to attract more
funds by removing restrictions on foreign investors holding debt
of Africa&#8217;s biggest oil producer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields &#8220;will probably drift lower in coming weeks on the
back of the foreign demand and as local institutional investors
and banks seek to increase their duration exposure,&#8221; Samir Gadio, an emerging markets strategist at Standard Bank Group
Ltd. in London, said in an e-mailed reply to questions today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The naira, which has been devalued twice by the central
bank since 2008 because of falling oil prices and import demand,
has strengthened 3.1 percent this year, the best performer in
Africa, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While inflation in Nigeria slowed to 11.7 percent in August
from a high this year of 12.9 percent in April, it is still
above the central bank&#8217;s 10 percent target. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors are buying record amounts
of notes paying returns based on ruble bonds as Russia prepares
to open the market to foreigners, triggering inflows Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. estimates may reach $30 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of the structured notes reached $641 million between
July and September, the most since Bloomberg began compiling the
data in 1999. Russia&#8217;s so-called OFZ bonds gained 3.8 percent
during the quarter as yields tumbled 43 basis points to 7.25
percent, JPMorgan Chase  Co. indexes show. The average yield on
similarly rated Mexican government bonds slipped eight basis
points to 5.7 percent, the indexes show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia plans to expand the investor base for its 3.1
trillion-ruble ($96 billion) Treasuries market by allowing
foreign investors to buy and sell through Euroclear Bank SA, the
world&#8217;s biggest bond settlement system, after five years of
discussion. The move will attract $20 billion to $30 billion by
mid-2013, Clemens Grafe, chief economist for Goldman Sachs in
Russia, said in a Moscow interview on Sept. 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Euroclear will make the Russian domestic bond market more
accessible to a wider range of investors,&#8221; Natasha Smirnova,
who helps manage $4 billion of emerging-markets assets as a
product specialist at PineBridge Investments in London, said by
e-mail yesterday. &#8220;This should result in a bigger, deeper bond
market over time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Central Depository &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Mexican bonds have been traded through Euroclear
since 1995, Russia&#8217;s Justice Ministry last week registered an
order by the market watchdog listing the settlement systems
allowed to open nominal holder accounts with a central
depository. Trading via Euroclear may happen as soon as December
if a single depository is created by November, Stephan Pouyat,
head of Brussels-based Euroclear&#8217;s global product management,
said on Sept. 13. That timescale hasn&#8217;t changed, he said by e-mail yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Group AG is the biggest seller this year of
structured notes at $587.8 million, followed by Citigroup with
$244.6 million and JPMorgan with $199.2 million, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also known as credit-linked notes, the securities offer
higher yields and tailored maturities that may not be available
in the bond market. Investors suffer losses if there&#8217;s a default
either by the bank issuing the note or the reference entity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruble bonds returned 3.8 percent in the third quarter,
compared with a 2.6 percent gain for Indian debt and a 0.5
percent decline for Chinese bonds, according to JPMorgan
indexes. Brazil&#8217;s bonds rallied 7.5 percent, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Foreign Ownership &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VTB Capital said in July that the 6 percent of the OFZ
market owned by foreign investors may jump fivefold in the first
half of next year once the market opens up. The growth of the
OFZ market and impact on capital flows will depend on the level
of issuance by the Finance Ministry, Goldman&#8217;s Grafe said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The $30 billion inflow from liberalization seems
realistic but it could take two to three years,&#8221; Euroclear&#8217;s
Pouyat said yesterday. &#8220;We have to look at it more as a catch-up compared to other emerging markets, as today the percentage
of foreign investors on OFZ is relatively low. Now, as for how
soon it will catch up, it all depends on how Russia as a country
will perform.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia&#8217;s Finance Ministry plans to sell as much as 335
billion rubles of so-called OFZ bonds in the fourth quarter, the
biggest three-month offering for at least a year. The government
is selling 130 billion rubles this month, starting with 25
billion rubles of 15-year notes tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ruble Appreciation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruble gained 3.6 percent versus the dollar in
September. It slid 0.2 percent to 31.1121 per dollar by 5:07
p.m. in Moscow. Non-deliverable forwards, which provide a guide
to expectations of currency movements, showed the ruble at
31.6010 per dollar in three months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia is rated Baa1 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, the
third-lowest investment-grade ranking. Russian sovereign dollar
bonds due in April 2020 rose, lowering the yield by six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 2.685 percent. The yield on
domestically traded notes due in June 2017 lost three basis
points to 7.49 percent. The yield on Russia&#8217;s international
ruble bond due in March 2018 declined two basis points to 6.225
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of protecting Russian debt against non-payment for
five years using credit-default swaps fell two basis points to
142, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The swaps cost 13
basis points less than contracts for Turkey, which is rated
three levels lower at Ba1 by Moody&#8217;s. The contracts pay the
buyer face value in exchange for the underlying securities or
the cash equivalent should a government or company fail to
adhere to its debt agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yield Gap &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to hold Russian debt
rather than U.S. Treasuries dropped five basis points to 202,
according to JPMorgan EMBI Global indexes. The difference
compares with 165 for debt of similarly-rated Mexico and 153 for
Brazil, which is rated one step lower at Baa2 by Moody&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on ruble government debt has fallen 67 basis
points from this year&#8217;s peak on June 4 to 7.25 percent as of
Sept. 28, compared with a decline of 63 basis points for
emerging markets to 5.80 percent, according to JPMorgan indexes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market liberalization could spur an increase in foreign
ownership of OFZ bonds to 20 percent from the current 6 percent,
according to Elena Kolchina, head of Renaissance Capital&#8217;s fixed
income group. Opening up the market could reduce yields by about
100 basis points over the next six months, she said yesterday in
e-mailed comments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This trend could be sustained and not a short-term
rally,&#8221; Kolchina said. &#8220;It could last for years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

Abu-Hadba is leaving the company and will be replaced by Steve Guggenheimer, who will head developer and platform evangelism, a
position tasked with winning over software developers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu-Hadba, a 21-year Microsoft veteran, will stay for
several months to assist the transition after the release of the
software maker&#8217;s flagship operating system, Windows 8, later
this month, according to an e-mail obtained by Bloomberg News.
The memo was written by S. Somasegar, who oversees the division
that works with software developers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The e-mail&#8217;s authenticity was confirmed by Microsoft
spokesman Frank Shaw. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guggenheimer in June decided to leave his position managing
the company&#8217;s relationships with computer makers and take a
sabbatical. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assurant Inc. (AIZ), the insurer of
foreclosed homes, climbed to the highest in five months after
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended investing in the stock on
the prospect the company will repurchase shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assurant gained 2.3 percent to $38.57 at 9:34 a.m. in New
York after Goldman Sachs upgraded its rating to buy from
neutral. The New York-based company dropped 6.1 percent this
year, compared with the 11 percent gain of the 24-company KBW
Insurance Index. (KIX) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Robert Pollock said last month that
Assurant will have more capital to deploy as its business
insuring foreclosed homes shrinks amid an improving housing
market. Goldman Sachs analysts led by Christopher Giovanni said
the company may repurchase $640 million of shares between the
third quarter of this year and the last three months of 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect AIZ to continue to aggressively deploy its
capital via buybacks,&#8221; the analysts wrote in a note to clients
today, using the company&#8217;s ticker symbol. &#8220;AIZ has the best
free cash flow story within our coverage group.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coverage of foreclosed homes expanded as homeowners missed
payments amid the worst housing crash in seven decades.
Regulators in California, Florida and New York have been
investigating whether insurers charged too much for so-called
force-placed insurance and the national group of insurance
overseers held a hearing on the business in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors are overly pessimistic about cuts in Assurant&#8217;s
prices tied to the investigations, the analysts said. Assurant
may reduce rates by 20 percent in California, 15 percent in
Florida, and 10 percent in New York, the analysts estimated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ken Costa, the former chairman of
Lazard Ltd.&#8217;s (LAZ) international unit, joined Developing Markets
Capital Partners, a private equity firm set up by three former
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) executives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costa, 62, has become the fifth partner at DMC, Chris Barter, one of the private-equity firm&#8217;s founders, said in an
interview in Moscow yesterday. He joins Barter, Edward K. Eisler, a former co-head of Goldman&#8217;s global securities unit,
Samuel Wisnia, former head of the firm&#8217;s global macro strats
and structure, as well as Philippe Costeletos, who formerly
ran TPG Capital&#8217;s European unit. Costa didn&#8217;t return an e-mail
seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Started earlier this year, DMC is yet to raise its first
private equity fund. Moscow-based Baring Vostok this week raised
$1.5 billion for the largest fund targeting Russia, prompting
speculation of a revival in investor appetite for private equity
funds targeting emerging markets. Russian funds attracted just
$135 million in 2011, compared with $7.08 billion for Brazil and
$16.6 billion for China, according to data compiled by the
Washington-based Emerging Markets Private Equity Association. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are looking at investing in China, Russia, Southeast
Asia, Turkey and sub-Saharan Africa,&#8221; Barter said. &#8220;There are
huge synergies in investing across those regions and timing
those markets appropriately. There are substantial emerging
trade flows between those countries as we have seen between
Russia and China and there are significant capital flows
following those trade flows.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New York lawsuit over mortgage-
backed securities filed Monday against JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) will
serve as a template for suits against other issuers, state
Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schneiderman alleged that the Bear Stearns business that
JPMorgan took over in 2008 deceived mortgage-bond investors
about the defective loans backing securities they bought,
leading to &#8220;monumental losses,&#8221; according to a complaint filed
yesterday in New York State Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bear Stearns mortgage unit packaged $212 billion in
mortgage bonds from 2003 through 2006, according to the
complaint. Losses on $87 billion of those bonds packaged during
just two of those years total $22.5 billion so far, it
estimated. Schneiderman said he wants the bank to disgorge all
money it obtained in connection with or as a result of the
alleged fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a workable template for future actions against
issuers of residential mortgage-backed securities that defrauded
investors and cost millions of Americans their homes,&#8221;
Schneiderman said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York hasn&#8217;t fully identified the losses in the JPMorgan
case, Schneiderman said yesterday in a teleconference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schneiderman is co-chairman of a state-federal group formed
to investigate misconduct in the bundling of mortgage loans into
securities leading up to the financial crisis. The group
includes officials from the Justice Department, the Securities
and Exchange Commission, the FBI and other federal and state
officials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, said the New York-
based bank would contest the complaint, which is &#8220;entirely
about&#8221; conduct by Bear Stearns. JPMorgan acquired Bear Stearns
in March 2008 after a run on what was then Wall Street&#8217;s fifth-
largest securities firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is People of the State of New York v. J.P. Morgan
Securities, 451556-2012, New York State Supreme Court, New York
County (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Joins BofA to End Card Adds-Ons as CFPB Cracks Down &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., Bank of America Corp. and American
Express Co. (AXP) are among credit-card lenders retreating from a
$2.4 billion market as regulators seek curbs on deceptive
marketing of products including debt cancellation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scrutiny from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has
led to fines against banks including Capital One Financial Corp. (COF)
and Discover Financial Services (DFS), prompting them to curtail sales
of so-called add-ons that offer to help customers pay card bills
if they get sick or lose their jobs, or to monitor their credit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Express also is cooperating with regulators amid
an &#8220;industrywide review&#8221; of the products, said Michael
O&#8217;Neill, a spokesman for the New York-based lender. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AmEx, the biggest U.S. credit-card issuer by purchases,
said on Monday that it will pay $112.5 million to settle claims
it violated consumer safeguards from marketing to collections in
products sold to about 250,000 customers. That case didn&#8217;t
involve add-on products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crackdown is CFPB Director Richard Cordray&#8217;s first
enforcement campaign after the Dodd-Frank Act consolidated
regulation of retail financial products under one federal
agency. With U.S. banks already complaining that regulation has
squeezed revenue, the bureau is considering new limits on payday
lending and fees for checking overdrafts, and has proposed an
overhaul of mortgage practices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;SEC Questions Revenue Disclosures of Real Estate Site Zillow &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zillow Inc. (Z), the real estate website, fell yesterday after
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asked the company to
respond to questions about how it reported revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seattle-based Zillow declined 4.21 percent to $39.11 in New
York. Before the release of the SEC&#8217;s letter, the stock had
gained 82 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC asked in a letter dated Aug. 30 why the company
didn&#8217;t report the percentage increase in the average price paid
for so-called Premier Agent subscriptions in its most recent
financial report, according to a regulatory filing. Zillow said
it would revise disclosures in its next quarterly report,
according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the SEC asked why total marketplace revenue
growth appears to be slowing while Premier Agent subscription
revenues look to be increasing. In response, Zillow said in the
filing that it would start disclosing the average monthly
Premier Agent revenue per subscriber. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This letter was in response to an early 2012 10-K filing
submitted by Zillow, and we have since responded to the SEC&#8217;s
satisfaction,&#8221; Katie Curnutte, a Zillow spokeswoman, said in an
e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, the SEC also asked Zillow to disclose the
number of unique users by domain name for different websites the
company operates, including Zillow.com and RentJuice.com,
according to a second letter released in a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Former Madoff Employees to Be Tried Next Year, Judge Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five longtime employees of Bernard L. Madoff&#8217;s investment
firm will go to trial Oct. 7, 2013, charged with participating
in history&#8217;s biggest Ponzi scheme, a judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain set the date
yesterday after the former Madoff employees, Daniel Bonventre,
Annette Bongiorno, Joann Crupi, Jerome O&#8217;Hara and George Perez,
pleaded not guilty to new charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors in the office of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in
Manhattan on Oct. 1 filed a new indictment alleging the five
joined a conspiracy to defraud investors that got its start in
the early 1970s. The charges add to the 17 criminal counts filed
against the former employees in November 2010, for a total of 33
counts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonventre, 65, and Bongiorno, 64, worked for Madoff for
40 years. Bongiorno rose to the level of supervisor and account
manager. Crupi, 51, an employee since 1983, tracked daily bank
account activity, prosecutors said. Perez, 46 and O&#8217;Hara, 49,
started at the firm in the early 1990s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant U.S. Attorney Lisa Baroni told Swain yesterday
that the prosecution case against the five will take about two
months. Swain said she will set aside 3 1/2 months for the
entire trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 74, pleaded guilty to fraud in 2009 for cheating
investors out of $20 billion in principal. He is serving a 150-
year term in federal prison in North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. O&#8217;Hara, 10-cr-00228, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Florida Man Pleads Guilty to Phony Facebook Share Scam &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A South Florida man charged with running an $11 million
scam involving nonexistent shares in companies including
Facebook Inc. (FB) and Groupon Inc. (GRPN) was taken into custody after
pleading guilty to criminal charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Mattera, 50, who operated Praetorian Global Fund Ltd.,
pleaded guilty yesterday in Manhattan to three criminal counts
-- conspiracy, securities fraud and wire fraud -- and tried to
plead guilty to a fourth, money laundering. U.S. District Judge
Richard Sullivan declined Mattera&#8217;s request to remain free on
bail, ordering him jailed after a two-hour hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a plea agreement, Mattera and prosecutors said federal
sentencing guidelines call for a term of 10 to more than
12 years in prison. Sullivan may disregard the guidelines in
sentencing Mattera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the SEC case, U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel in New
York found that Mattera sold a Lamborghini automobile for
$28,000, which he passed to his mother, in violation of a court-
ordered asset freeze. Mattera also borrowed $114,000 and
transferred money to his mother to pay his expenses, also in
violation of the order, Castel said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl Schoeppl, Mattera&#8217;s lawyer, declined to comment on the
case after the hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Mattera, 11-CR-2947, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Morgan Stanley Loses Appeal in $245 Million Citigroup Suit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal appeals court in Manhattan upheld a ruling
against Morgan Stanley  Co. (MS) in a breach-of-contract suit in
which it&#8217;s accused of failing to pay a Citigroup Inc. (C) unit
$245 million under a swap agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citibank NA arranged the swap for protection in the event
that a collateralized debt obligation based on a line of credit
provided to an entity called Capmark defaulted, according to the
ruling yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citibank sued in 2009, alleging that Morgan Stanley refused
to pay the shortfall owed under the swap after Capmark defaulted
on its loan agreements and the $366 million CDO was liquidated.
In 2011, U.S. District Judge Shira A. Scheindlin ordered Morgan
Stanley to pay $245 million plus interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court rejected Morgan Stanley&#8217;s argument that
it wasn&#8217;t obligated to pay because Citibank NA ordered the CDO
liquidated without Morgan Stanley&#8217;s permission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lauren Onis, a spokeswoman for New York-based Morgan
Stanley, declined to comment on the appeals court ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased with the decision of the Second Circuit of
Appeals affirming the judgment in our favor,&#8221; Danielle Romero-
Apsilos, a spokeswoman for New York-based Citigroup, said in an
e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Citibank N.A. v. Morgan Stanley  Co.
International Plc, 11-2592, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.S. Role in Lehman Collapse Allowed in Reserve Trial &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government&#8217;s role in the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. will be allowed as evidence in the Oct. 9
trial over allegations that Reserve Primary Fund misled
investors in 2008, a federal judge in Manhattan ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will be permitted to present evidence that its
confidence in Lehman&#8217;s finances were based in part on the U.S.
Securities Exchange Commission&#8217;s oversight of the investment
bank under a voluntary regulatory program, according to the
decision by U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trial is scheduled to begin Oct. 9 in the SEC&#8217;s case
alleging that the company misled investors about the safety of
the fund after it suffered losses in Lehman investments. The
fund, which held $785 million in debt issued by Lehman, became
the first money fund in 14 years to expose investors to losses
when Lehman filed for bankruptcy protection in September 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Defendants intend to argue that Bent Sr. believed that
Lehman&#8217;s financial reports were sound, and this belief was
critical to his state of mind on September 15 and 16,&#8221; Gardephe
said in his ruling, referring to Reserve Partners founder and
Chief Executive Officer Bruce R. Bent, a defendant along with
his son, Bruce Bent II. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge excluded evidence regarding government actions
following Lehman&#8217;s bankruptcy filing and the beginning of
Reserve Primary Fund&#8217;s collapse, including government bailout
programs and the SEC&#8217;s investigation of Lehman and other
financial firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Dellaportas, a lawyer for the defendants, and SEC
attorney Nancy A. Brown didn&#8217;t immediately return calls for
comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Reserve Management Co. Inc. 09-cv-
04346, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Playboy Enterprises to Settle Investor Case for $5 Million &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playboy Enterprises Inc. agreed to pay $5.25 million to
settle a lawsuit over claims its founder, Hugh M. Hefner,
shortchanged investors in a going-private buyout in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stockholders sued beginning in 2010 over the offer, which
started at $5.50 a share and increased to $6.15 a share the
following year. The parties agreed to the settlement partly to
avoid continued litigation, according to Delaware Chancery Court
papers made public yesterday in Wilmington. Playboy, based in
Chicago, denied any wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Plaintiffs&#8217; counsel have concluded that the settlement is
fair and adequate and that it is reasonable,&#8221; the parties wrote
in their memorandum. The agreement requires a judge&#8217;s approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playboy expanded globally in the 1960s and 1970s when
Hefner, now 86, ran the company. The company went public in 1971
and circulation reached 7.2 million for one issue in 1972.
Hefner is the company&#8217;s chief creative officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teri Thomerson, a spokeswoman for Playboy, and plaintiffs&#8217;
lawyer Carmella Keener didn&#8217;t immediately respond to e-mail
messages seeking comment on the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re Playboy Enterprises Inc. Shareholders
Litigation, CA5632-VCN, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ResCap Mortgage Holders Seek Details on Servicing Unit Sale &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residential Capital LLC, the bankrupt mortgage unit of Ally
Financial Inc. (ALLY), should be barred from selling its loan servicing
unit until the company provides more information about the deal,
investors who bought ResCap mortgages said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government-chartered
mortgage buyers, on Monday objected to the sale, claiming that
without changes the proposed deal may threaten contracts they
have with ResCap to service loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit being sold collects payments and provides
foreclosure services on more than 1 million loans Fannie and
Freddie bought from ResCap. Because they own a large share of
the 2.4 million loans that ResCap services, the two mortgage
holders said in court papers filed in Manhattan, they expected
ResCap to be more cooperative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ResCap, based in New York, filed for bankruptcy in May with
plans to sell most of its assets and resolve legal claims
related to residential mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said last month that it is working to resolve
objections to the proposed sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ResCap plans to hold an auction for the mortgage servicing
business, with a unit of Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG) as the
lead bidder. The unit, Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc. (NSM), has
agreed to buy the servicing business for more than $2.4 billion
unless it is outbid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In separate filings, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac said they
would support the sale if ResCap and the winning bidder provide
enough information to ensure that their servicing contracts are
not disrupted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Residential Capital LLC, 12-12020, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Speeches and Conferences &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SEC Holds Conference on Trading Technology and Crisis Management &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday held
two roundtable discussions on trading and efforts to prevent
errors. Led by Robert Cook, director of the agency&#8217;s trading and
markets division, the first session focused on market technology
and efforts to prevent trading errors. Participants in that
panel included Chris Isaacson, chief operating officer of Bats
Global Markets Inc.; Jamil Nazarali, head of Citadel Execution
Services at Citadel LLC; Lou Pastina, an executive vice
president at NYSE Euronext; and Jonathan Ross, chief technology
officer of Getco LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second session focused on market responses once errors
have occurred. Participants included David Bloom of UBS AG, Chad
Cook of Lime Brokerage LLC, Anna Ewing of Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.
and Lou Steinberg of TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Miliband Seeks Tighter U.K. Merger Rules Against &#8216;Predators&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. opposition leader Ed Miliband pledged to tighten
takeover rules and end quarterly reporting for companies, saying
that would encourage longer-term thinking and businesses that
are &#8220;producers&#8221; rather than &#8220;predators.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his keynote speech yesterday to his Labour Party&#8217;s
annual conference in Manchester, England, Miliband laid claim to
the &#8220;one nation&#8221; model of politics defined by Conservative
Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli in 1872 and said banks and
other businesses should be bound to similar tenets. He said
David Cameron, the current Tory leader and premier, had
abandoned &#8220;one nation&#8221; policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miliband said Labour is now the party best able to
represent people of all backgrounds and incomes, and that recent
British governments, including those headed by Labour&#8217;s Tony
Blair and Gordon Brown, in which he was a minister, failed to
hold the powerful to account. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A feature in the newest version of Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s Internet Explorer Web browser that tells websites not to track online activity is harmful for advertisers and will hurt competition, an industry group said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &#8220;do not track&#8221; setting shouldn&#8217;t be on by default in the update of the browser, the board of the Association of National Advertisers said in a letter to Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer. It was signed by top marketing and sales executives at more than three dozen companies, including Coca-Cola Co. (KO), Ford Motor Co. (F), Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) and American Express Co. (AXP) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft plans to include Internet Explorer 10 with Windows 8, the latest version of its personal computer operating system that will be released later this month. The move reduces choices for consumers using the browser, which has a 43 percent market share in the U.S., the trade group said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;If Microsoft moves forward with this default setting, it will undercut the effectiveness of our members&#8217; advertising and, as a result, drastically damage the online experience by reducing the Internet content and offerings that such advertising supports,&#8221; the trade group said in the letter, which was posted on its website. &#8220;This result will harm consumers, hurt competition, and undermine American innovation and leadership in the Internet economy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

Inc., the Los Angeles Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter, the chief executive officer of Guggenheim Partners
LLC, said the possible &#8220;synergy&#8221; in marketing and sponsorship
among the Los Angeles teams attracts him to AEG as an
investment, the newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AEG owns the National Hockey League&#8217;s Kings, the Galaxy of
Major League Soccer and a 30 percent stake in the National
Basketball Association&#8217;s Lakers. Anschutz has also offered to
fund construction of a $1 billion, 65,000-seat stadium in
downtown Los Angeles to try to lure one of the National Football
League&#8217;s 32 teams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter said Guggenheim will make a final evaluation on the
prospect of bidding on AEG after the company releases
confidential financial information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guggenheim bought the Dodgers for $2.15 billion in May. AEG
officials have said the company that owns the Staples Center and
the Home Depot Center may bring as much as $7 billion, the Times
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s full-length,
Hollywood-style movie based on the next &#8220;Halo&#8221; video game will
skip the big screen, streaming instead on Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s YouTube
before heading to store shelves as a DVD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based maker of the Xbox console,
promoting the November release of &#8220;Halo 4,&#8221; has taken the
unusual step of creating its own 90-minute movie, at a cost of
almost $10 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft plans to release weekly installments of &#8220;Halo 4:
Forward Unto Dawn&#8221; on the Web before offering the game and DVD,
a move that highlights the influence of new media, including
promotional options and the ability to cut out traditional
channels like theaters. The film airs starting tomorrow in five
15-minute segments on the YouTube channel Machinima Prime,
leading up to the game&#8217;s debut on Nov. 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re either the best-funded Web series of all time, a
sort of mid-road healthy TV pilot, or a super-low budget
movie,&#8221; director Stewart Hendler said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clips of &#8220;Forward Unto Dawn&#8221; will stay online through
Nov. 23, then disappear until Dec. 4, when a Blu-ray disc goes
on sale that includes an added 15 minutes, for a suggested
$28.99. The film will also be available for download from Apple
Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iTunes, Microsoft&#8217;s Zune Marketplace and other online
movie stores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft almost didn&#8217;t make a &#8220;Halo&#8221; movie. In 2006, the
company shelved plans for a live-action theatrical release with
Universal Pictures and Twentieth Century Fox over financial
concerns, Variety reported at the time. The trade publication
put the budget at $135 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seasoned Director &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the stumbles in Hollywood, Microsoft began financing
and distributing short videos and animated films online, while
selling rights to make novels and comic books based on &#8220;Halo.&#8221;
For &#8220;Forward Unto Dawn,&#8221; the company hired Hendler, whose
directing credits include the horror movies &#8220;Sorority Row&#8221; and
&#8220;Whisper,&#8221; and developed a script based on one of the novels
and tied to the pending game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the production team hired the actors, Microsoft
retained final say, including the decision not to use Steve
Downes, according to Matt McCloskey, a Microsoft business
director who manages Halo&#8217;s development. Downes&#8217; distinctive
voice as Master Chief in the games is known to legions of
&#8220;Halo&#8221; fans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Window? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By self-producing a movie and then releasing it both online
and through traditional home-video outlets, Microsoft has carved
a new distribution path, Laura Martin, a media analyst at
Needham  Co., said in an interview. YouTube and other streaming
sites traditionally show short-form video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re basically replicating the traditional film-window
strategy of movie to home video, but they&#8217;re releasing it on the
Web,&#8221; Martin said. &#8220;With this experiment, they&#8217;ve now given us
another window into, &#8216;What does the premium online content
market look like?&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least two movies, &#8220;Girl Walks Into a Bar&#8221; and &#8220;The
Princess of Nebraska,&#8221; made their debuts online before moving
to home video, according to Chris Dale, a spokesman for Mountain
view, California-based Google. Consumers who buy a limited
edition of the game will receive a free download of the movie on
their Xbox, McCloskey said, a tie-in that highlights the
marketing possibilities for other videos tied to games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Produced over five weeks last spring in Vancouver, the
movie tells the story of an alien invasion that occurs 25 years
before the original &#8220;Halo&#8221; video game, with a new hero called
Thomas Lasky and appearances by Master Chief, the protagonist in
previous games. Actor Daniel Cudmore, who played Colossus in two
&#8220;X-Men&#8221; movies, dons the armored suit of Master Chief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Top Franchise &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Web world is making everybody that works within it
think outside the normal pattern of film development,&#8221; Hendler
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which released the first &#8220;Halo&#8221; title in
November 2001, rose 0.6 percent to $30.03 at the close in New
York. The shares have gained 16 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Halo,&#8221; exclusive to the Xbox, ranks among the 10
largest-grossing video-game franchises of all time, selling tens
of millions of copies, according to Michael Pachter, an analyst
at Wedbush Securities. The franchise has generated more than $3
billion in revenue, according to Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has a lot at stake with the next installment,
said Pachter, who is based in Los Angeles. &#8220;Halo 4&#8221; is the
first title in the franchise to be developed by 343 Industries,
the Microsoft-owned studio that was tapped in 2007 to oversee
the property after its creator, Bungie Studios, became
independent and signed a 10-year publishing deal with Activision
Blizzard Inc. (ATVI) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &#8220;Halo 4&#8221; and the accompanying movie, 343 Industries
aims to draw a broader science-fiction audience, Microsoft&#8217;s
McCloskey said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You see something that looks like a video game, you&#8217;re
going to get the same crowd you always get,&#8221; McCloskey said.
The movie is &#8220;not simply a marketing vehicle, though. It is in
and of itself a standalone property.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), ConocoPhillips, BP
Plc (BP/) and TransCanada Corp. said a project to liquefy and export
natural gas from Alaska will cost as much as $65 billion and
take more than 10 years to construct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The venture includes an 800-mile (1,300-kilometer) pipeline
from the North Slope to Alaska&#8217;s southern coast as well as a
liquefaction plant and storage tanks, the companies said in an
Oct. 1 letter received by Alaskan Governor Sean Parnell&#8217;s office
yesterday. The governor had asked the companies to &#8220;harden the
numbers&#8221; on the project by the end of September, Parnell said
in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As oil output from the North Slope has dropped, energy
companies and Alaska&#8217;s government are seeking ways to sell the
area&#8217;s gas, which may generate as much as $20 billion in annual
revenue as demand from Asia increases. The North Slope may hold
35 trillion cubic feet of reserves and more than 200 trillion
cubic feet of undiscovered, technically recoverable gas, making
it one of the largest sources in the world, according to the
governor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This will be a game-changer for global LNG trade because
it will be one of the largest projects ever,&#8221; Dan Sullivan,
Alaska&#8217;s natural resources commissioner, said today in a
telephone interview. Plans call for exports of 3.5 billion cubic
feet of natural gas per day, he said. &#8220;Knowing this project has
to compete globally, we&#8217;ll be working with these companies to
make this the most cost-competitive project there is.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Mega-Project&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pipeline and liquefaction facility would be &#8220;a mega-
project of unprecedented scale and challenge,&#8221; executives of
Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips (COP), BP and TransCanada said in the
letter to Parnell. &#8220;The opportunity is challenged by its cost,
scale, long project lead times and reliance upon independent oil
and gas operations with declining production.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP and ConocoPhillips joined with TransCanada and Exxon
after deciding last year to halt a competing $35 billion
pipeline proposal known as Denali. The companies are cooperating
with a smaller state-backed pipeline project which would deliver
North Slope gas to Alaska customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bigger project, which will also include a plant to
remove carbon dioxide from the gas and marine facilities, would
require 1.7 million metric tons of steel and as many as 15,000
people at peak construction, the companies said. The venture
would compete with global supplies of liquefied natural gas, or
LNG, coming into the market in the next 20 years from Australia,
East Africa, the U.S. Gulf Coast and Canada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TransCanada&#8217;s Role &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TransCanada (TRP) will build the North Slope pipeline to carry
gas to the export terminals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m encouraged that the companies have made significant
progress in advancing a project and an associated schedule,&#8221;
Parnell said in the statement. &#8220;They have fully shifted their
efforts to an Alaska LNG project.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies have yet to make a final decision on whether
to proceed with the project. Design, engineering and
construction may take 10-and-a-half years, barring permitting
and financing delays, the companies said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alaska agreed to incentives should the final decision to
build the project be completed in 2016, Sullivan said in today&#8217;s
interview. Based on the timeline submitted yesterday, that would
peg first shipments in 2021 or 2022, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reimbursing TransCanada &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state has agreed to reimburse TransCanada $500 million
for development costs, he said. Other incentives might include
expedited permitting, tax breaks or state-backed low-interest
financing, Sullivan added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is good progress,&#8221; Sullivan said. &#8220;Alaska is fully
motivated to keep the pedal to the metal on it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies made clear in their letter that they want
signed LNG sales and shipping agreements before making a final
decision to proceed with the project, Sullivan said. The
arrangement would be similar to other global LNG works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial cost estimate is $45 billion to $65 billion.
Estimated cost by Chevron Corp. (CVX) for the Gorgon liquefied natural
gas project off Australia, scheduled for first shipments in
2014, is $45 billion. Deutsche Bank AG estimated Sept. 14 Gorgon
may cost A$50 billion ($51.3 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plans to export gas from the North Slope come as companies
are proposing to build LNG facilities on Canada&#8217;s West Coast to
send the fuel to Asia. Apache Corp. (APA)&#8217;s Kitimat LNG project, which
has Encana Corp. (ECA) and EOG Resources Inc. (EOG) as partners, is
estimated to cost $15 billion for the plant, pipeline and wells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased production from shale-gas resources in the U.S.
has also led to proposals to export LNG from facilities on the
Gulf Coast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alaska, the only U.S. state operating an LNG export plant,
is seeking to parlay its more than 40-year history of sending
fuel to Asia from ConocoPhillips&#8217;s terminal near Kenai into an
advantage for expanding shipments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state&#8217;s coast provides one of the closest routes to
Asian markets, potentially giving it lower shipping costs than
competing projects from western Canada, Robert Brooks, founder
of RBAC Inc., an energy data company, said in an interview
before yesterday&#8217;s announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Asian Demand &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asian demand will lead a 17 percent increase in global gas
demand by 2017 from 2011, the International Energy Agency
forecast in June. China&#8217;s annual gas consumption will more than
double to 273 billion cubic meters in the period, the IEA said.
Chinese gas consumption in 2017 would equal about 28 percent of
the reserves identified on Alaska&#8217;s North Slope. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2025, the four largest consumers of LNG will be Japan,
China, India and South Korea, according to a presentation by BG
Group Plc. (BG/) In 2011, the top four countries were Japan, South
Korea, the U.K. and Spain, BG said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gasoline strengthened in the Gulf
Coast, reversing a two-day decline, after Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) shut
a unit at its Baytown, Texas, oil refinery and Colonial Pipeline
Co. shut two lines that carry the fuel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon shut a diesel hydrotreater after a fire at Baytown,
the largest U.S. oil refinery. Colonial lines 19 and 20, which
move products from Atlanta to Nashville, were shut yesterday
after an odor was detected. Line 19 may have leaked 500 gallons
of gasoline, said Steve Baker, a spokesman for the Alpharetta,
Georgia-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast increased 1 cent to 6.25 cents versus futures traded
on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 12:02 p.m., according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery gained 9.81 cents to
$2.9501 a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s 584,000-barrel-a-day Baytown plant accounts for
almost 7 percent of Gulf Coast production, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Colonial, operator of the largest conduit
between Gulf Coast oil refiners and East Coast makers, delivers
an average 100 million gallons a day of refined products to
shipping terminals in 13 states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refinery maintenance began this week at Citgo Petroleum
Corp.&#8217;s East and West plants in Corpus Christi and at a shut
section of a crude unit at Motiva Enterprises LLC&#8217;s Convent,
Louisiana, refinery. The Citgo and Motiva facilities account for
a combined capacity of 420,000 barrels per day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ian Hannam, one of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s top advisers on the proposed transaction between Xstrata Plc (XTA) (XTA) and Glencore International Plc (GLEN) (GLEN), formally left the firm last week to focus on his mining interests, three people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hannam, 56, stepped down in April from his day-to-day role at the bank after he was fined by the U.K. Financial Services Authority. He is now focused on projects including his investment in Kabul-based Afghan Gold and Minerals, the people said, asking not to be identified because his plans are private. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hannam&#8217;s options include setting up his own firm, which may provide asset management, advisory and investment services in the mining and natural resources industry, with a focus on high- risk markets, one of the people said. Hannam left JPMorgan on Sept. 28, according to the U.K.&#8217;s Financial Services Authority Register. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Created in June last year, Afghan Gold is controlled by Sadat Naderi, an Afghan entrepreneur and the president of Afghan Krystal Natural Resources, with the remaining stake held by Guernsey-based Centar, which Hannam founded. Afghan Gold, run by former U.K. Special Air Service commander Richard Williams, has a gold mining license in Baghlan Province, Afghanistan, and is expanding its global interests, one of the people said. Centar is also pursuing projects in places such as Myanmar and Zimbabwe, the person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hannam and an official at JPMorgan in London declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;FSA Decision &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hannam, JPMorgan&#8217;s chairman of equity capital markets, stepped down in April to appeal a decision by the FSA to fine him 450,000 pounds ($721,000) for market abuse. He e-mailed a potential customer in 2008 with details of a bid for his client Heritage Oil Plc (HOIL), as well as news of an oil find, the FSA said at that time. Hannam said in a statement then he would appeal and planned to continue his financial career after the dispute is over. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Based in London, Hannam was among bankers advising Xstrata, the subject of a bid by Glencore. At JPMorgan, which also serves as a broker to Xstrata, Hannam helped the mining company first sell shares in 2002, and was involved in many of its subsequent takeovers, including the $18.1 billion purchase of the Canadian nickel producer Falconbridge Ltd. (FALCF) in 2006. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The former JPMorgan banker is &#8220;an exceptionally clear thinker when identifying opportunities. He&#8217;s attracted to the complicated and difficult parts of the world by nature,&#8221; said Williams, 45, in a telephone interview from Afghanistan. The two men have known each other for more than a decade. &#8220;As far as he&#8217;s concerned, it&#8217;s &#8216;achieve the mission or leave the building.&#8217; &#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hannam joins other senior dealmakers who have quit large investment banks this year. Morgan Stanley&#8217; (MS)s most senior dealmaker in London, Simon Robey, plans to step down after 25 years to start his own advisory firm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Robey, the firm&#8217;s co-chairman of global mergers and acquisitions and head of its U.K. operation, will leave in January, the bank said in a memorandum to employees last week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Ambereen Choudhury in London at achoudhury@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Edward Evans at eevans3@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is
considering opening a representative office in Santiago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets expects to make a
decision on the matter &#8220;relatively soon,&#8221; Michael DuVally, a
New York-based spokesman at Goldman Sachs, said by phone from
Santiago, which he is visiting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs already manages wealth for Chilean families,
DuVally said. The bank has helped arrange two Chilean bond sales
this year, both for Banco Santander Chile, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs had offices in Buenos Aires, Mexico City, and
Sao Paulo, according to the firm&#8217;s 2011 annual report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, Goldman Sachs said it planned to slash annual
expenses by $500 million, mostly by cutting compensation, after
it posted the lowest first-half revenue in seven years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two former Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
senior traders are starting a hedge fund with at least $50
million in initial capital from Investcorp, a firm that seeds
alternative-investment firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rishi Chadda and Cyrus Pouraghabagher will start New York-
based Kingsguard Advisors LP on Nov. 1, which will employ a
global macro fixed-income strategy, according to an Investcorp
statement that was obtained by Bloomberg News. In addition to
the allocation, Investcorp will also provide Kingsguard with
risk, marketing and operational services, according to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kingsguard is the first global macro fixed-income strategy
among the funds to which Investcorp has given initial capital,
Deepak Gurnani, the firm&#8217;s head of hedge funds and chief
investment officer, said in a telephone interview.  Investcorp
has investments in six hedge funds, collectively holding $1.8
billion, through its seeding program. Kingsguard will try to
profit from bets on interest rates, volatility, credit markets
and mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes to global regulations and moves by central banks
worldwide are among factors that are contributing to price
swings and market volatility, Chadda said in a telephone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These changes create exciting investment opportunities,&#8221;
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Investcorp&#8217;s Investments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investcorp, based in Bahrain, has $11.5 billion in assets.
Its three businesses include corporate investment in the U.S.,
Europe and the Gulf Cooperation Council; real estate investment
in the U.S.; and global hedge funds. It is publicly traded on
the Bahrain Bourse (INVCORP), runs its hedge fund operations out of New
York and also has a London office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chadda and Pouraghabagher, both 37, who started their
careers as analysts in the mortgage department of Goldman Sachs
in the summer of 1997, rose to senior trading roles at the firm.
Chadda became a managing director and worked in Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
interest-rate products group, and Pouraghabagher became a vice
president on the firm&#8217;s mortgages desk, which included
derivatives and residential mortgage securities that lack
government backing. &lt;/p&gt;

Orders of Friendship by Russian President Vladimir Putin,
according to a Kremlin decree. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon and Eni have formed alliances to develop Arctic
resources and work jointly on overseas projects with state-run
OAO Rosneft, Russia&#8217;s biggest oil producer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthias Warnig, who was named board chairman of United Co.
Rusal on Oct. 1, received the Order of Honor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warnig, a former East German Stasi agent who has known
Putin since at least 1991, is managing director of the OAO
Gazprom-led Nord Stream AG venture, which runs Russia&#8217;s only
direct natural gas pipeline to western Europe. He is a board
member at Rosneft and chairman of oil pipeline operator OAO
Transneft&#8217;s board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The executives were among 12 people who received awards
under the decree, dated Sept. 30. Tillerson, Scaroni and
Warnig&#8217;s medals were in their roles in developing cooperation
with Russia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colombia, once the largest supplier of cocaine worldwide, is cracking down on traffickers by thwarting theft of oil used to make the drug. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Police are destroying clandestine refineries where guerrillas and crime gangs process crude stolen from pipelines to use in cocaine production, said Lieutenant Colonel Hector Alvarez Yotagri, head of a police unit that tracks the practice. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Each refinery is a big part of oil theft,&#8221; he said yesterday in a phone interview from central Colombia. &#8220;They still have rustic labs nearby. Going after the refineries diminishes their resources.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rebels have targeted pipelines to guarantee fuel supplies for drug processing as well as show their military strength by more than quadrupling attacks on oil infrastructure as peace negotiations begin this month with the government. Rebels have used cocaine to fund an armed conflict dating to the 1960s in Colombia, South America&#8217;s third-largest oil supplier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The stolen oil is heated in tanks, known locally as Martians, or marcianos in Spanish. The fuel is then poured over coca leaves, the main ingredient in cocaine. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Colombia is the third-largest producer of the narcotic after being overtaken by Peru and Bolivia, according to U.S. government estimates. Colombia produced 195 metric tons last year, U.S. Office of the National Drug Control Policy data show. The three countries produce 100 percent of the cocaine supplied to a global market estimated at about $85 billion, according to the United Nations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Flying Saucers &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Police have destroyed 21 clandestine refineries, seized 53 Martians and about 226,000 gallons of stolen crude and fuel after beginning patrols in the second quarter along part of Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL)&#8217;s Transandino pipeline in an isolated, mountainous stretch of southern Colombia, police statistics show. The 307 kilometer (191 mile) pipeline crosses through provinces that, according to United Nations&#8217; estimates, have the nation&#8217;s largest illegal plantations of coca leaves. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rebels pierce pipelines to attach valves and hoses that siphon oil into nearby collection pools carved into the earth. The Martian tanks, so-named because of a similarity in some cases to the shape of flying saucers, are used to create a gasoline substitute, which in turn is used to make a paste from coca leaves that&#8217;s later processed into cocaine. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Thwarting Attacks &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of the narcotic requires between 74 gallons to 86 gallons of gasoline to process, according to the UN, government controls have made it harder to steal or purchase the fuel, making pipelines a target for theft especially in isolated areas, Alvarez said. Colombia&#8217;s largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, steals crude and charges fees when others rob oil on their turf, including areas near the nation&#8217;s borders. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Colombia said in July that it&#8217;s working with neighboring countries including Ecuador on its southern border to coordinate strikes on drug crops and hidden laboratories and to track ingredients used to process cocaine. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Crude robbery nationwide rose to an average of about 512 barrels a day in the first nine months of the year, according to police. Theft was 419 barrels a day in 2011 from Ecopetrol&#8217;s pipelines, the company said. According to police statistics, theft in 2011 was the highest in at least a decade. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Production Losses &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most of that crude was stolen from the Transandino, police said, where patrols are starting to ease theft and help to thwart attacks. Sabotage of pipelines across Colombia quadrupled to 88 incidents in the first seven months of the year from 20 in the year earlier period. The assaults prompted Ecopetrol to cut its 2012 production target in July by 20,000 barrels a day to 780,000 barrels a day. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ecopetrol slid 0.4 percent to close at 5,340 pesos in Bogota at 2:59 p.m. Ecopetrol is the seventh-most valuable oil company worldwide with a market value of $123 billion, based on data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ecopetrol, in an e-mailed statement, referred questions about security to the armed forces. Higher oil theft reflects increased controls on refined fuels and social and economic difficulties of some communities in southern Colombia, according to the e-mail. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dana Coffield, president of Gran Tierra Energy Inc. (GTE) that uses the pipeline, said in an e-mail yesterday that the company doesn&#8217;t comment on installations it doesn&#8217;t own. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ecopetrol forecasts a full-year output loss of about 9,000 barrels a day from sabotage after losing about 3,000 barrels a day of production in September, Chief Financial Officer Adriana Echeverri said in London on Sept. 27. Attacks eased last month before peace talks, Echeverri said then. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Peace Negotiations &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Theft may not decline as the first peace talks in a decade are scheduled to begin this month, since the FARC isn&#8217;t the only group that filches crude, said Diego Usme, an analyst at Bogota-based brokerage Ultrabursatiles SA. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Robbery is far from being resolved by negotiations since there are a lot of actors involved,&#8221; Usme said Oct. 3 by phone. &#8220;It will have to do with increasing protection of the lines.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The FARC may not want to loosen its hold on drugs, the group&#8217;s top source of financing, Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington, said last month. Talks in Oslo will include negotiations about trafficking, according to the government&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And paying for your own fuel isn&#8217;t cheap. Brent crude has gained 12 percent in the past year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Heather Walsh in Bogota at hlwalsh@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: James Attwood at jattwood3@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s Barry Zubrow,
who oversaw risk management while the bank amassed credit-
derivative bets that led to a multibillion-dollar trading loss,
will retire at the end of this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Now is the right time in my life&#8221; to retire, Zubrow, 59,
wrote to colleagues in a note today. &#8220;We have learned from the
mistakes of our recent trading losses.&#8221; The contents of the
note were confirmed by Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for the New
York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zubrow was chief risk officer from November 2007 until
January, as bank personnel were evaluating changes to the
computer-based mathematical models used to measure the potential
for trading losses. The changes, which took effect in mid-
January, made risks in the firm&#8217;s chief investment office look
smaller than they were, fueling losses that reached $5.8 billion
as of June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since January, Zubrow was head of corporate and regulatory
affairs, where he lobbied the Federal Reserve and other
regulators for looser controls on proprietary traders in the
CIO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a management shuffle in July, JPMorgan Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon moved Zubrow from reporting directly to him
to reporting to 41-year-old Matt Zames, who was promoted to co-
chief operating officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Thoughtful Counsel&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon said in a separate memo to staff today that he had
benefited from Zubrow&#8217;s &#8220;thoughtful counsel and analysis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zubrow, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive who was
hired by Dimon in 2007, also was the brother-in-law of Irv Goldman, who was appointed chief risk officer of the chief
investment office in February. Goldman, 52, had been fired in
2007 by Cantor Fitzgerald LP for money-losing bets that led to a
regulatory sanction of that firm, Bloomberg News reported on May
20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was during Goldman&#8217;s watch that Bruno Iksil, a CIO
trader in London, put on the trades that Dimon later called
&#8220;egregious.&#8221; Less than a week after the loss became public,
the bank stripped Goldman of those duties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the losses mostly occurred this year, the trades that
went wrong were designed to hedge other positions built up in
2011, according to Michael Cavanagh, a senior executive at the
bank who led an internal inquiry into the cause of the losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ina Drew, who was the bank&#8217;s chief investment officer,
resigned in May after the losses were disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zubrow&#8217;s retirement was previously reported by the Wall
Street Journal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s $5.8 billion
trading loss this year showed that the financial system is
getting too complicated for even respected institutions, the
president of China&#8217;s sovereign-wealth fund said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You are creating a system that very few people
understand, much less the regulators because the regulators
haven&#8217;t the incentives like the bankers,&#8221; Gao Xiqing, president
of China Investment Corp., said today at a lunch hosted by the
Economic Club of New York. &#8220;As a former regulator I think we do
need to slow down a little bit instead of rushing up to all
those fancy derivatives.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gao, who said he was speaking in a personal capacity and
not in his role at the CIC, said the loss attributed to a trader
known as the London Whale was especially instructive because it
happened at a bank he holds in high regard and wasn&#8217;t the result
of a rogue employee. New York-based JPMorgan, the biggest U.S.
bank by assets, lost the money because of derivatives held by
its chief investment office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That single thing was most revealing to me at least
because I respect this institution JPMorgan very much,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;We believe in their risk management, we believe in the
fact that they&#8217;re being cautious.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He expressed concern about a society in which &#8220;all the
best engineers are engineering financial products.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You have all the smartest kids to design these products,
the only purpose of which is to get money out of other people&#8217;s
pockets,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That is not very good.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gao said he tries to avoid relying on financial models in
his own investments because he doesn&#8217;t trust them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CIC is an investor in Morgan Stanley (MS), the sixth-biggest
U.S. bank, which competes with JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, was asked by U.S. regulators how it recorded high
profit overseas and losses at home when 40 percent of its sales
were inside the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a May 9 letter filed today, Securities and Exchange
Commission staff asked New York-based Pfizer to explain why
earnings before taxes outside the U.S. were $15 billion in 2011
while losses within the country were $2.2 billion. By piling up
profit in low-tax jurisdictions overseas, Pfizer has been able
to cut its tax rate reported to investors and boost results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These operating results appear to be inconsistent with
your domestic and international revenues, which in 2011 were
$26.9 billion and $40.5 billion, respectively,&#8221; wrote Jim Rosenberg, the commission&#8217;s senior assistant chief accountant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is one of the most aggressive U.S. companies
reporting income in countries with lower tax rates than the U.S.
as a way of reducing their effective tax rate, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The drugmaker had the second-highest
amount of profit kept overseas, $63 billion, behind only General
Electric Co., according to securities filings as of March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is among the companies that have lobbied U.S.
lawmakers for a tax holiday that would allow it to bring some of
the overseas profit back to the country at a lower tax rate.
Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, argued for
such a holiday in his Oct. 3 debate with President Barack Obama. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not Helpful &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its response to regulators, Pfizer wrote that giving
more information about how it distributed its earnings among
various locations wouldn&#8217;t be helpful to investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The geographical mix of revenues is not a good indicator
of the split between domestic and international pretax earnings
for purposes of financial statement presentation, especially for
a multinational company that manages its operations on a global
basis,&#8221; wrote Loretta V. Cangialosi, Pfizer&#8217;s controller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We do not believe that disclosure regarding the reasons
for the geographical split of pretax earnings would be
meaningful or useful to investors,&#8221; she wrote on May 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, according to the correspondence, Pfizer cut 9.4
percent from its tax rate by designating profit as overseas. And
in 2011 the company reduced the rate 3.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is slimming down by divesting its animal health and
infant nutrition units to focus on producing new medicines to
replace revenue from its best-selling cholesterol pill Lipitor,
which until it lost patent protection last year was the top drug
in the world with about $9.6 billion in 2011 sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has paid all the taxes it is legally obligated to,
said Joan Campion, a company spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;150 Countries &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We conduct business in more than 150 countries and face
significant competition from companies located outside the
United States, including many competitors located in lower tax
jurisdictions,&#8221; Campion said in an e-mail. &#8220;At all times and
wherever we operate, Pfizer complies with the appropriate tax
law.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said in an Aug. 27 letter that it would add more
disclosure, including a line saying, &#8220;the jurisdictional
location of earnings is a significant component of our effective
tax rate each year as tax rates outside of the U.S. are
generally lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate.&#8221; The
company would also explain how tax breaks in Ireland, Singapore
and Puerto Rico lower its rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the disclosures provided are sufficient and
have received a response from the SEC that it has no further
comments on those filings,&#8221; Campion said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is not alone in getting these questions from the
SEC. In December, the commission questioned Google about its
earnings in other countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florence Harmon, a spokeswoman for the SEC, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman&#8217;s fraud lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase  Co. for
the misdeeds that occurred at Bear Stearns Cos. has sent exactly
the wrong message to Wall Street: Don&#8217;t worry, you can get away
with seemingly criminal behavior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet JPMorgan -- the bank that bought the stock of Bear
Stearns in March 2008 with a $30 billion assist from the U.S.
government -- is offended. The suit alleges that Bear Stearns&#8217;s
bankers and traders manufactured and sold about $20 billion of
mortgage-backed securities containing home loans they knew were
fraudulent. What JPMorgan objects to is that the government
asked it to buy Bear Stearns &#8220;over the course of a weekend&#8221; to
help keep the financial system from collapsing, and now, more
than four years later, it has the temerity to sue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can imagine Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan (JPM)&#8217;s chief executive
officer, saying: If this is the thanks we get, you can pretty
much be assured that next time you ask us to save a failing
systemically important institution, we&#8217;ll just walk away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methinks the bank doth protest too much. JPMorgan didn&#8217;t
buy Bear Stearns as a favor to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson,
New York Fed President Timothy Geithner and Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke; it bought Bear Stearns because it saw an
opportunity to acquire on the cheap a company with assets it
coveted. JPMorgan admired Bear Stearns&#8217;s clearing business, its
commodities trading, a few of its bankers and traders and, most
of all, its sleek, new skyscraper at 383 Madison Avenue, across
the street from JPMorgan headquarters at 270 Park Avenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First Offer &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty much from the start of that fateful weekend in
March, JPMorgan knew that there was no serious competition for
Bear Stearns. And that wasn&#8217;t because the government had
handpicked Dimon to save the company. Dimon&#8217;s first offer was $8
to $12 a share, a two-thirds discount to Bear Stearns&#8217;s closing
price of about $30 a share that Friday. Bear Stearns&#8217;s
management was incredulous that Dimon would make such a low
offer. So the JPMorgan CEO lowered it even further. Then, on
Sunday morning, Dimon&#8217;s representatives told Bear Stearns&#8217;s
executives that he was walking away from the deal altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s when panic erupted and Paulson, working behind the
scenes, got Dimon to agree to buy Bear Stearns for $2 a share if
the government took $30 billion of squirrelly assets that
JPMorgan didn&#8217;t want. The $2-a-share deal was announced Sunday
night. Dimon had paid less for the equity of Bear Stearns than
the market value of the building at 383 Madison. JPMorgan soon
scrapped plans to erect a new building downtown for its
investment-banking operations, which were moved instead across
the street to the former Bear Stearns digs. (The purchase price
for Bear Stearns was later increased to $10 a share supposedly
because of a legal drafting error; who precisely was to blame
for that mess or how it happened has never been made clear.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In doing a stock-for-stock deal for Bear Stearns, JPMorgan
not only bought all of the bank&#8217;s assets -- except for the $30
billion taken by the New York Fed -- but it also took over its
liabilities, including its debt and its lawsuits, both the known
ones and those to come. JPMorgan knew that it would be held
responsible for the bad behavior that led Bear Stearns to the
brink of disaster and viewed that potential liability as just
another cost of the deal. (Bank of America Corp. faced the same
predicament -- only much worse -- in its acquisitions of
Countrywide Financial Corp. and Merrill Lynch  Co.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For JPMorgan to complain about Schneiderman&#8217;s suit, even
though this was one of the risks it agreed to take in the March
2008 merger agreement with Bear Stearns, is beyond ridiculous;
it&#8217;s simply spin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Deceptive Acts&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That isn&#8217;t the worst of it. What makes Schneiderman&#8217;s suit
against JPMorgan a total yawner on Wall Street is that the
attorney general failed to bring criminal charges against
JPMorgan for the doings at Bear Stearns. How Schneiderman could
let the bank off so easily when the complaint itself claims that
Bear Stearns &#8220;committed multiple fraudulent and deceptive acts
in promoting and selling its&#8221; mortgage-backed securities is an
utter mystery. If those aren&#8217;t criminal offenses under
securities law, could someone please tell me what is? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint describes repeated bad behavior at Bear
Stearns, including a now-infamous e-mail that describes one
securitization deal in the most vulgar of scatological terms.
Those e-mails alone make clear that Bear Stearns executives knew
that they were packaging and selling a load of junk to
investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s also clear that after March 15, 2008, JPMorgan knew it
would be legally responsible for that bad behavior. The lawsuit
will probably be settled shortly -- I would guess for about $100
million -- and Schneiderman will no doubt sue other Wall Street
firms for similar reasons. He will extract fines out of them,
too, and fill New York state&#8217;s coffers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet he missed a chance to change the behavior on Wall
Street by his decision not to make the criminal case against
Bear Stearns and its owner, JPMorgan. A $100 million fine?
That&#8217;s a joke for JPMorgan and an unneeded cost for the bank&#8217;s
shareholders and its insurance carrier. Bear Stearns was picked
up for a song, in what still ranks as one of the savviest
business deals of the past decade. Schneiderman blew it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s territorial spat with China
may cause the Japanese economy to contract this quarter and
hasten a current account slide as exports decline and Chinese
tourism to Japan drops off, according to a JPMorgan report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute will knock 0.8 percentage point off Japan&#8217;s
gross domestic product in the October-December period, JPMorgan
Securities Japan Co. economists Masaaki Kanno and Masamichi Adachi wrote in an e-mailed note yesterday. They now estimate
fourth-quarter GDP will contract 0.8 percent from the previous
quarter, compared with a previous estimate of no growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The squabble over islands claimed by Asia&#8217;s two largest
economies imperils a $340 billion trade relationship ahead of
China&#8217;s power transition and a possible general election in
Japan this year. Carmakers are hardest hit, with Mazda Motor
Corp. (7261) deliveries in China last month falling 35 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As its global role has increased, China has become much
more important in Japan&#8217;s international trade,&#8221; Kanno and
Adachi wrote. &#8220;While there remains a lot of uncertainty ahead
and the risk of the dispute escalating cannot be ruled out, we
assume that it will diminish in two quarters under the new
governments in both countries.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan joins Morgan Stanley and BNP Paribas AS in
predicting Japan&#8217;s economy will shrink for two consecutive
quarters through the end of December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst diplomatic crisis between the two countries since
2005 may also accelerate a deterioration in Japan&#8217;s current
account surplus, the JPMorgan economists said, predicting the
excess could disappear before the end of 2014. This compares
with its estimate in January that the nation would begin posting
a deficit in the first quarter of 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exports Fall &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s exports fell 5.8 percent in August from a year
earlier, the third straight monthly decline, with shipments to
China, its largest trading partner, dropping 9.9 percent and
those to the European Union slumping 22.9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (7211) on Oct. 5 reported Chinese sales
slumped 63 percent in September from a year earlier, while the
Yomiuri newspaper said on the same day, without citing where it
received its information, that Toyota Motor Corp.&#8217;s deliveries
in China fell 50 percent from August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute has caused cancellations of 40,000 seats on All
Nippon Airways (9202) flights between the two countries, the airline
said last month. JPMorgan said it is assuming a 70 percent
decline in the number of Chinese tourists visiting Japan this
quarter, compared with the average first-quarter figures in 2011
and 2012, lowering receipts by 67 billion yen ($852 million), or
38 percent of the expected decline in exports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s economy may also be adversely affected, as the
unrest may prompt Japanese companies to accelerate the
diversification of investment and trade in Asia away from the
nation, the JPMorgan economists said. More than 5,000 affiliates
of Japanese companies operated on the mainland as of the end of
March 2011, employing 1.6 million people, according to a
Japanese trade ministry report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) agreed to
pay $6.75 million to eight U.S. exchanges to settle claims over
the way it handled options trades from January 2004 through May
2010, according to a document on the Chicago Board Options
Exchange&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based securities firm mislabeled certain
options orders as originating with customers instead of brokers
or market makers, potentially giving them access to preferential
treatment, according to a letter of consent. Goldman Sachs,
which was censured by the exchanges, neither admitted nor denied
wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which oversees
more than 4,300 brokers, has been assessing how firms categorize
orders in sweeps it is conducting to ensure they are complying
with rules, Richard Ketchum, chairman and chief executive
officer of Finra, said at a conference in Washington on Sept.
20. Mismarking orders affects the execution priority given to
users, the official audit trail of executions, and the fees paid
to exchanges, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Historically, traders have attempted to get better
pricing from exchanges by representing someone as a customer,&#8221;
Stephen Solaka, a former CBOE member who oversees about $60
million including options as co-founder of Belmont Capital Group
in Los Angeles, said in a phone interview. &#8220;The exchanges are
competing for customer order flow and would bend over a little
more for a customer than they would for a market maker.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Different Categories &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy and sell requests from market makers, brokers, public
customers and professionals are treated differently by many
exchanges, with those from customers usually executing before
others. The fees exchanges charge may vary based on the type of
company or individual submitting the order. Goldman Sachs
employed two order-entry systems that failed to identify the
source of options orders, according to the disciplinary action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re pleased to have settled these matters,&#8221; Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, said by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The G2 and Stride systems Goldman Sachs employed were
deficient because they didn&#8217;t allow users to select different
codes to identify the orders properly, the document said. The
Stride system coded all orders as coming from customers. Some
orders may have received priority in transactions over others
because they were mislabeled, the document said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Supervisory Systems &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs &#8220;failed to maintain supervisory systems and
controls that were reasonably designed to achieve compliance
with exchange rules,&#8221; the CBOE document said. The broker also
didn&#8217;t immediately fix its coding deficiencies when problems
were identified by its employees on several occasions, the
letter of consent said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nasdaq Options Market said in its disciplinary action that
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s compliance, equity derivative sales and sales
technology groups didn&#8217;t communicate adequately about the
development of G2 and Stride. System developers also didn&#8217;t
understand the broker&#8217;s client base for options, contributing to
deficiencies in the order-entry platforms, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBOE, the largest U.S. options exchange, will get $3.75
million of the total fine, CBOE Holdings Inc. (CBOE) said. The other
exchanges include the International Securities Exchange, Nasdaq
Options Market, Nasdaq OMX PHLX, NYSE Amex Options, NYSE Arca
Options, Bats Options and BOX Options Exchange, according to the
document. ISE said in a separate notice it will get $1.1 million
of the total amount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reimbursement Payments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs separately reimbursed exchanges for the
difference between the fees it paid to trade on their venues and
what it owed them, CBOE said. ISE said the broker paid almost
$900,000 in uncollected fees for improperly marking orders as
coming from customers instead of brokers or market makers. ISE
in New York is owned by Frankfurt-based Deutsche Boerse AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finra&#8217;s focus on the labeling of options orders is part of
a broader review of controls brokers employ to ensure that buy
and sell requests are properly identified. The private-sector
regulator has uncovered a &#8220;large number of firms that are
either misreporting positions or not reporting them at all,&#8221;
flouting obligations concerning their so-called large-options
positions, Ketchum said in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The misuse of market-maker exemptions for firms that must
otherwise locate shares before engaging in short sales is
another area of investigation, Ketchum said. Finra is probing
excessive quotation message traffic caused by algorithms and
enhancing its examination and market surveillance programs to
uncover manipulative activity, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. soft drink companies led by
Coca-Cola Co. (KO) and PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) have agreed to put calorie counts
on vending machines and encourage low-calorie drinks as sugary
beverages come under increasing scrutiny. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting in 2013, vending machines in government buildings
in Chicago and San Antonio will advise consumers to &#8220;Check then
Choose&#8221; and &#8220;Try a Low-Calorie Beverage,&#8221; according to a
statement today by the American Beverage Association, the
industry&#8217;s chief trade group. The companies, including Dr Pepper
Snapple Group Inc. (DPS), will then expand the plan nationally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid rising obesity rates, lawmakers have proposed taxing
sugary drinks in more than 30 states to curb consumption, an
initiative that has foundered after resistance from the soda
lobby. That prompted New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the
city&#8217;s health board to ban the sale of super-size sugared drinks
in some locations. U.S. soft drink sales have declined for seven
straight years amid lower demand for full-calorie colas as
consumers turn to healthier options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s the next step in the evolution of public
disclosure,&#8221; said Thomas Mullarkey, a Chicago-based analyst for
Morningstar Inc (MORN), citing past advances such as nutrition labels
and front-of-package calorie citations. &#8220;It helps consumers
while appeasing political powers and regulators, so soft drink
companies are seen as encouraging healthy decisions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closer integration of the European
Union&#8217;s natural gas and power markets can encourage a shift to
less-polluting fuels in the bloc&#8217;s member states and help reduce
carbon-dioxide emissions, according to Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 27-nation EU needs to make sure that the importance of
natural gas &#8220;is not lost&#8221; in the debate about the bloc&#8217;s
climate and energy policies, Linda DuCharme, director of Europe,
Russia and the Caspian at Exxon Mobil International Ltd. said in
an interview in Brussels on Oct. 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When Europe is struggling with the challenge of reducing
CO2 emissions and supporting growth in renewables, gas-fired
power generation is an important consideration and really the
only one that can support renewables and continue to keep CO2
emissions down,&#8221; DuCharme said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her comments came as the European Commission, the EU&#8217;s
regulatory arm, is preparing to publish in November a policy
paper urging member states to speed up the enactment of
legislation aimed at breaking down national barriers in natural
gas and power markets by 2014. The creation of a competitive
pan-European gas and power market may add 0.8 percent to EU
gross domestic product by 2020, creating more jobs and helping
keep inflation down, according to the commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU, which wants to lead the global fight against
climate change, aims to lower greenhouse gas emissions by 20
percent in 2020 compared with 1990 levels and decarbonize its
power sector by 2050. Poland, which relies on coal for around 90
percent of its electricity needs, has said the EU goal would
require a major change to its fuel mix and is possible only with
widespread deployment of carbon capture and storage technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Climate Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The east European country, which buys about 70 percent of
its gas from Russia&#8217;s OAO Gazprom (GAZP), blocked a political
declaration by EU environment ministers on future climate policy
this year and in 2011. Poland pays Gazprom &#8220;more than $500&#8221;
per 1,000 cubic meters, compared with a $360 spot price and the
$400 to $420 that German companies pay in long-term contracts,
Treasury Minister Mikolaj Budzanowski said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Part of the solution comes with improving the
interconnectiveness of the European gas market,&#8221; DuCharme said.
&#8220;The more the European markets are interconnected the more you
will see the free flow of gas across borders and Poland will
have more options from where to get its natural gas than just
from further east.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DuCharme said Poland might not necessarily have to import
natural gas, but could instead buy electricity from outside the
country that is generated from gas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Potential Distortion&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DuCharme also said unpredictable regulations make companies
less willing to invest in projects that &#8220;have lifespan over
decades.&#8221; The EU plan to intervene in the carbon market is a
&#8220;potential distortion&#8221; and undermines the system&#8217;s
credibility, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission proposed in July to delay auctions of some
carbon permits in its emissions trading system as of 2013 to
alleviate oversupply in the market and help prices recover after
they slumped to a record low in April. The number of permits to
be delayed hasn&#8217;t been determined and the plan requires support
from national governments and the European Parliament to be
enacted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the commission is seen as being able to go in every
couple of years and change the rules of that game, then anybody
who&#8217;s trying to make investments in power generation or anything
that has a cost of carbon in their economic analysis is not
going to know what to put in that analysis,&#8221; DuCharme said.
&#8220;Any bank that is trying to fund these investments is going to
see that as a risky situation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

Chairman Jim O&#8217;Neill said he did not apply to become the next
governor of the Bank of England. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have not applied,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said in an e-mail today.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it was appropriate for me to apply. I have an
important job.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidates to replace Mervyn King as chief of the U.K.
central bank have until 8.30 a.m. in London to express their
interest to the Treasury after it advertised the position in the
Economist magazine. King is scheduled to leave the bank in June
2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Neill took up his current position in 2010 after serving
as Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s (GS) chief economist, during which time
he created the BRICs acronym to describe the growing power of
key emerging markets Brazil, Russia, India and China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Sept. 11, bookmaker Paddy Power Plc (PAP) listed O&#8217;Neill as
fourth favorite to replace King with odds of 10/3, meaning a
successful 3-pound ($4.80) bet would win a 10-pound profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Neill told Bloomberg Television in June that he would
consider the Bank of England position &#8220;if I was approached.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has historically been a breeding ground for
central bank chiefs. Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney,
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi and Federal Reserve
Bank of New York President William Dudley worked there. Bank of
England policy maker Ben Broadbent was also employed by the
bank. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China needs to expand the access
local governments have to private capital for funding about 19
trillion yuan ($3 trillion) of investment projects they&#8217;ve
announced since May, JPMorgan Chase  Co. analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowing economic growth and central government limits on
lending to local authorities and the property sector have
created &#8220;headwinds&#8221; for local governments&#8217; &#8220;traditional&#8221;
funding sources that include fiscal revenue, land sales and bank
borrowings, Hong Kong-based analysts Haibin Zhu, Lu Jiang and
Grace Ng wrote in a research note dated Oct. 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lack of funding for local government investment projects
may extend the economic slowdown in China, where growth
moderated in the second quarter to the weakest pace in three
years, Song Guoqing, an adviser to the nation&#8217;s central bank,
said last month. Expansion has slowed as the European debt
crisis sap demand for exports and a campaign to rein in home
prices eroded domestic consumption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, China introduced a 4 trillion yuan stimulus plan
to fend against the effects of the global financial crisis. That
plan provided loans from state-owned banks for local
infrastructure projects, which later spurred concerns some of
the debt would go unpaid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The crucial ingredient is the source of funding,&#8221; the
JPMorgan analysts wrote. &#8220;The lesson from the 2008-2009
experience is that the government should reduce the role of
public funding and allow access of private capital in areas that
used to be dominated by the state sector.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) lost a U.S. Supreme Court bid to block a $19 billion judgment by an Ecuadorean court in an almost two-decade legal battle over pollution in the Amazon rain forest. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The highest U.S. court, without comment, today let stand a federal appeals court ruling against Chevron. The appellate court said a federal trial judge in New York couldn&#8217;t bar a group of Ecuadoreans from seeking to collect the award anywhere in the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chevron says the judgment is the product of fabricated evidence and is the largest awarded by a foreign court against a U.S. company. The Ecuadoreans blame Texaco Inc., which Chevron acquired in 2001, for destroying the environment in the Lago Agrio region of the rain forest. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The high court rebuff eliminates one legal avenue for Chevron in litigation that has produced dozens of U.S. court decisions. The company, based in San Ramon, California, is pressing separate legal theories before a federal trial judge in New York. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;While Chevron is disappointed that the court denied our petition, we will continue to defend against the plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers&#8217; attempts to enforce the fraudulent Ecuadorean judgment and to further expose their misconduct,&#8221; Chevron said in an e- mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The appeal centered on the power of federal courts to issue so-called declaratory judgments. In ruling against Chevron, the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York said the company couldn&#8217;t seek an order blocking the award until the Ecuadoreans sought to enforce the judgment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron&#8217;s latest loss before the Supreme Court is an example of the company&#8217;s increasingly futile battle to avoid paying its legal obligations in Ecuador,&#8221; Aaron Marr Page, a lawyer for the Ecuadoreans, said in an e-mail. &#8220;Chevron is running from justice while its toxic dumping continues to create an imminent danger of death to indigenous peoples in Ecuador.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Justice Samuel Alito didn&#8217;t take part in today&#8217;s action. As is the court&#8217;s custom, he gave no reasons. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court case is Chevron v. Naranjo, 11-1428. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Greg Stohr in Washington at  gstohr@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael Hytha at  mhytha@bloomberg.net; Steven Komarow at  skomarow1@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects percentage decline in second paragraph.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) said third-quarter
earnings were &#8220;substantially&#8221; lower than second-quarter
results amid lower oil output, falling crude prices and weaker
U.S. refining returns. The stock fell 1.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil and natural gas output fell 4 percent to the equivalent
of 2.518 million barrels a day in June and July from 2.624
million for the entire second quarter, the San Ramon,
California-based company said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron said production fell as Hurricane Isaac shut wells
in the Gulf of Mexico and oilfield repairs were carried out in
the U.K. and Kazakhstan. The company received an average price
of $96.86 for each barrel of crude pumped outside the U.S., 2.4
percent less than in the prior quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s refining profit declined after an August fire
damaged a crude-processing unit at a Richmond, California,
plant. The unit will remain out of service through the end of
December, the company said. A refinery in Pascagoula,
Mississippi, was shut for part of the quarter as Isaac passed
through the region, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron declined 1.7 percent to $115.36 at 5:25 p.m. in New
York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the second-largest U.S. energy company by market
value, is scheduled to release full third-quarter results on
Nov. 2. Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) is the biggest U.S. energy company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) said a fire-damaged
crude-processing unit a California refinery won&#8217;t resume
production before the end of the year as retail gasoline prices
surged to a record in the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crude unit was knocked out of service during an August
blaze at the refinery near San Francisco. Chevron, based in San
Ramon, California, announced the extent of the closure in a
statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Richmond disruption was the first in a chain of events
that crippled Californian fuel markets and led to gasoline
shortages that have forced some filling stations to shut and
others to raise prices close to $5 a gallon. Governor Jerry
Brown this week ordered regulators to ease pollution rules to
speed delivery of fuel supplies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular gasoline at the pump climbed to an all-time peak of
$4.671 a gallon, according to data published today by AAA, the
nation&#8217;s largest motoring organization. That&#8217;s up from the
previous record of $4.668 reported at the same time yesterday.
Prices jumped 50 cents last week as refineries reduced output
and Chevron shut a crude pipeline because of contamination. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ATT Inc. (T) and International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM) are combining their resources in a joint offering
to seek a bigger slice of the $14 billion market for cloud
services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, the world&#8217;s biggest computer services provider, will
provide the data-storage facilities and services, and ATT, the
largest U.S. phone carrier, will offer the global network that
clients will use to retrieve the data, the companies said today
in a statement. They&#8217;ll split revenue from the deal. &#8220;Cloud
services&#8221; refer to storing information and software in off-site
data centers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To improve its cloud offering, IBM is forging the closest
relationship it&#8217;s ever had with a phone carrier. The Armonk, New
York-based company will be the first to get direct access to the
technology that controls ATT&#8217;s network for business customers,
and the two companies&#8217; sales forces will coordinate on work with
clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving ATT&#8217;s customers the option of adding cloud services
from IBM on a network they already use will be &#8220;huge,&#8221; said
Andy Geisse, head of the phone company&#8217;s unit for business
clients. &#8220;With our customers, we see cloud computing as a key
part of their network infrastructure and of their compute
environment going forward,&#8221; he said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Working Together &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As competitors from Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) to Oracle
Corp. (ORCL) and SAP AG (SAP) expand their cloud offerings, ATT and IBM
concluded that working together would help them seize a greater
portion of the market. The computer industry will reap $14
billion this year from cloud services, up 24 percent from 2011,
according to research firm IDC in Framingham, Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is pursuing a target of $7 billion in cloud revenue by
2015 after such sales more than tripled last year. It hasn&#8217;t
disclosed how much it currently makes from cloud computing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a major component of how we get to that $7
billion,&#8221; said Erich Clementi, senior vice president of IBM&#8217;s
global technology services division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With its access to the controls of Dallas-based ATT&#8217;s
network, IBM will be able to shift capacity on the network so it
can push the flow of data to where it&#8217;s most needed, like to a
client&#8217;s supply-chain management systems during a holiday
season, Clementi said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More Control &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers will be able to decide how to store information
in IBM&#8217;s data centers and access it through ATT&#8217;s network. ATT
has been increasing the control it gives businesses through
products that let employers block certain applications or
websites from employees and run anti-virus software. IBM markets
its cloud products to larger businesses that need tailored
services, like ways to run a supply chain or manage health data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM fell less than 1 percent to $207.99 at the close in New
York. The shares have gained 13 percent this year. ATT, up 23
percent this year, dropped 1.4 percent to $37.14 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, IBM expanded its PureSystems lineup of
computing, storage and networking technology to include three
new products -- one for rapid transactions and two for analyzing
data to help companies make faster decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The products, which can be used within hours of setup, will
help contribute toward the $16 billion the company expects to
make from analytics by 2015, said Arvind Krishna, general
manager of IBM&#8217;s information management software unit. IBM
hasn&#8217;t disclosed how much revenue it now gets from analytics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re going after Oracle in a large way with these
systems,&#8221; Krishna said in an interview, referring to the
world&#8217;s largest supplier of database software. &#8220;We are seeing a
tremendous amount of increase in the data needs from our
customers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deborah Hellinger, an Oracle spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t return a
call for comment before normal business hours. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The premium for California-blend
gasoline, or Carbob, rose after Exxon Mobil Corp. reported late
yesterday its Torrance, California, refinery plans to flare
between tomorrow and Oct. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emissions aren&#8217;t related to a breakdown, Exxon said in
a notice to state regulators. The 150,000-barrel-a-day refinery
resumed normal operations Oct. 5 after an Oct. 1 power failure
that reduced output. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California gasoline premiums surged as a result of the
outage and after a fire that knocked out a crude-processing unit
at Chevron Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s plant in Richmond, near San Francisco, in
August. The shutdown of a Chevron pipeline that delivers crude
to Northern California because of contamination also reduced
supplies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premium for California-blend gasoline in Los Angeles
versus futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange surged 22.5
cents to 57.5 cents a gallon at 1:43 p.m. in New York, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The same fuel in San Francisco
jumped 22.5 cents to 49.5 cents above futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-grade, or CARB, diesel in Los Angeles was
unchanged at 15.5 cents a gallon higher than heating oil futures
on the Nymex. The fuel in San Francisco was steady at  15 cents
a gallon versus futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in Portland, Oregon, added
8 cents to 36 cents against gasoline futures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) and other movie and
TV studios asked a federal judge to rule that the file-sharing
website Lime Wire LLC and its founder, Mark Gorton, induced
people to illegally download shows and films without payment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies, which also include Viacom Inc. (VIAB), News Corp. (NWSA)&#8217;s
Twentieth Century Fox Film and Time Warner Inc. (TWX)&#8217;s Warner Bros.
Entertainment, are seeking the same judgment a federal court
granted to the music industry against Lime Wire in 2010,
according to a court filing in Manhattan yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Users by the tens of millions were attracted to LimeWire
to access -- for free -- infringing copies of virtually any type
of copyrighted content,&#8221; the entertainment companies, which
sued in February, said in yesterday&#8217;s motion for summary
judgment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs said U.S. District Judge Harold Baer should
find Lime Wire and Gorton liable for inducement of copyright
infringement without a trial. TV shows such as &#8220;South Park&#8221;
and &#8220;Desperate Housewives&#8221; and movies including &#8220;Avatar&#8221; and
the &#8220;Harry Potter&#8221; films were among the material allegedly
infringed, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lime Wire developed peer-to-peer software that allowed
users to share digital entertainment files on their computers
with other people over the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Gorton Directed&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Gorton directed and benefited from Lime Wire&#8217;s inducement
of infringement,&#8221; the entertainment companies said in the
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gorton operates Tower Capital Research LLC, a New York-
based hedge fund that trades securities based on mathematical
algorithms it developed. Gorton said today in a phone interview
that he hadn&#8217;t seen the motion for summary judgment and couldn&#8217;t
comment on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood in May 2010 found Lime Wire
and Gorton liable for inducing infringement of copyrights for
recorded music. The site was shut down by an October 2010 court
order. Lime Wire settled with the recording industry for
$105 million in May 2011 during a trial in Manhattan to
determine damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new case, the parties were unable to reach a
settlement, according to a docket entry in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. v. Lime Wire
LLC, 12-0818, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New World Resources Plc (NWR) fell to its
lowest level in about three years after JPMorgan Chase  Co. cut
the stock recommendation to &#8220;underperform&#8221; from &#8220;neutral&#8221;
citing &#8220;weakness&#8221; in coking coal markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock slid 0.27 koruna, or 0.3 percent, to 85.7 koruna
in Prague trading. That&#8217;s the lowest level since July 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan expects NWR to &#8220;underperform due to a lack of
growth and weakness in coking coal markets, while the balance
sheet leverage continues to increase,&#8221; JPMorgan analysts wrote
in a research note dated today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also lowered its price estimate for the shares to
260 pence from 530 pence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank expects small and mid-size miners to continue to
underperform large diversified names and recommends investors to
favor &#8220;quality&#8221; over leverage, the note said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) co-founder Bill
Gates, who stepped down in 2008 from a day-to-day job at the
world&#8217;s biggest software maker, said he has no plans to return
to the company in an active role. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I am committed now full time to my foundation work,&#8221;
Gates, 56, said in Abu Dhabi today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gates served as chief executive officer of Microsoft until
2000, when he started the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation, a
charitable organization that fights hunger, disease and poverty.
He maintained other management roles at Microsoft until 2008 and
remains the Redmond, Washington-based company&#8217;s chairman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I didn&#8217;t retire from Microsoft because I thought things
were getting boring,&#8221; Gates said. &#8220;I did decide that the

&lt;p&gt;Sharp Corp. (6753), the Japanese electronics
maker on course to post a second straight full-year loss,
dropped to the lowest level in at least 38 years in Tokyo
trading after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its rating to sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharp slumped 15 percent to 151 yen, the lowest since at
least 1974. The stock was the biggest loser on the benchmark
Nikkei 225 (NKY) Stock Average, which fell 1.1 percent. Japanese
markets were shut yesterday for a public holiday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maker of Aquos televisions may need to issue new stock
to raise funds, eroding shareholder value, Goldman Sachs
analysts led by Takashi Watanabe wrote in a report on Oct. 6.
Goldman Sachs, which cut the stock&#8217;s rating from neutral, also
reduced Sharp&#8217;s 12-month price estimate by 31 percent to 120 yen
because of expectations that earnings per share will be diluted
by about 50 percent with the new stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even assuming continued financial support from its banks,
we are more convinced Sharp will need to issue fresh equity,&#8221;
Goldman Sachs wrote in the report. Sharp&#8217;s equity-to-asset ratio
&#8220;could deteriorate further if more inventory valuation losses
or fixed-asset writedowns emerge,&#8221; the brokerage said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharp isn&#8217;t in a position to comment on the views of
Goldman Sachs, Miyuki Nakayama, a spokeswoman at the Japanese
company, said by telephone today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will need to book 106 billion yen ($1.4
billion) of unrecognized pension reserves next fiscal year,
trimming the equity ratio to 4 percent at the end of March 2014,
Goldman Sachs said. That compares with about 24 percent in the
year ended March 31, the report showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brokerage widened its estimate for Sharp&#8217;s net loss
this fiscal year to 474.5 billion yen from 374.5 billion yen to
include 100 billion yen in deferred tax-asset writedowns. Sharp
on Aug. 2 forecast a loss of 250 billion yen for the 12 months
ending March 31. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) probably
will post a third-quarter profit that exceeds Wall Street
estimates more than that of any other big bank, according to
International Strategy  Investment Group LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gains on the firm&#8217;s own investments and revenue from
underwriting and trading debt will help New York-based Goldman
Sachs earn $2.70 a share, ISI analysts led by Ed Najarian said
yesterday in a research note. The average estimate of 25
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg is $2.27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), ranked first
and fourth by assets among U.S. banks, are set to kick off the
industry&#8217;s third-quarter earnings season tomorrow. Goldman
Sachs, the fifth-largest bank and the one that gets the highest
percentage of revenue from trading, is scheduled for Oct. 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect most large banks to beat&#8221; earnings-per-share,
or EPS, estimates, Najarian wrote. &#8220;The main drivers of EPS
upside should be stronger than expected mortgage origination
revenue and debt capital markets revenue.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Najarian predicts New York-based JPMorgan will report
earnings per share of $1.20 and San Francisco-based Wells Fargo
88 cents, both one cent better than the average estimate of
analysts in the Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and Citigroup Inc. (C), the third-largest U.S. lender,
offer the biggest potential share increases from third-quarter
results, according to Najarian. That&#8217;s because both stocks are
valued at 8 to 9 times their estimated &#8220;core&#8221; annual earnings,
which excludes one-time gains and losses, he wrote. Citigroup
may earn $1.01 a share in the quarter, beating the average
estimate by 4 cents, according to the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s stock, which has climbed 14 percent since
the end of August, already factors in higher profit, Najarian
wrote. If third-quarter profit of $2.70 a share is annualized to
$10.80, the stock is valued at 11.1 times earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s own bank research team, led by London-based Kian Abouhossein, also published a note yesterday raising its
estimates for third-quarter revenue from investment banking and
fixed-income trading and recommended owning a higher weighting
in banks tied to those activities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OAO MegaFon (MFON), Russia&#8217;s second-largest wireless carrier by customers, sought to reassure investors one day after making an initial public offering filing that revealed Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) would no longer be on the share sale. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Corporate governance is very important to MegaFon,&#8221; MegaFon spokesman Petr Lidov said by e-mail yesterday. &#8220;We decided to launch the IPO on October 9 and we are working with banks that were ready to go ahead with us on that date,&#8221; Lidov said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) and Russia&#8217;s Sberbank CIB are managing MegaFon&#8217;s share sale, with help from Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), Citigroup Inc. (C) and VTB Capital, the company said on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Persistent uncertainty about MegaFon&#8217;s future ownership structure, coming as the company prepares to go public, is what led Goldman and MegaFon to part ways on the IPO, a person familiar with Goldman&#8217;s decision-making said, asking not to be identified because the process was private. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;MegaFon&#8217;s majority shareholder is AF Telecom, controlled by billionaire Alisher Usmanov. Usmanov has said in previous interviews that he planned to put his assets into an umbrella company, USM Holding, that would be jointly owned with his partners, Vladimir Skoch and Iranian-born accountant Farhad Moshiri. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Umbrella companies are common ownership vehicles in Russia, where they are used by other businessmen such as Mikhail Fridman, Oleg Deripaska, Victor Vekselberg and Mikhail Prokhorov. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Shareholder Structure &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Skoch and Moshiri may get as much as 30 percent and 10 percent of USM, respectively. That said, Usmanov has yet to announce a final decision on the umbrella company set to retain a major stake in MegaFon, which means the wireless carrier&#8217;s shareholder structure remains unclear. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.K. Listings Authority, one arm of the Financial Services Authority, requires that all companies meet its criteria before they list, and continue to do so once they are listed. One of those criteria is demonstrating the ultimate ownership of any U.K.-listed company, which a sophisticated structure like an umbrella company can obscure. Still, MegaFon&#8217;s current ownership is clear, and plans for a change of control do not necessarily present a problem under U.K. rules. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Board Representation &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our majority shareholder will represent only a minority of three board directors, with the majority comprising two independent directors and two representatives of TeliaSonera,&#8221; Lidov said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;MegaFon&#8217;s second-largest shareholder, the Swedish telecommunications company TeliaSonera, said that it may reduce its 35.6 percent stake, while still maintaining at least a 25 percent interest in the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Companies are returning to the IPO market after months of low volumes during which market volatility caused by Europe&#8217;s sovereign debt crisis led investors to stay away from such offerings. Initial share sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa have raised $6 billion this year, compared with $37 billion in the same period last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Russian Struggle &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman has worked with Usmanov on other deals, including co-leading the $912 million IPO of his Internet firm Mail.ru in 2010. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, the bank has struggled to maintain a consistent presence in Russia after opening its first office in Moscow in 1994. Goldman named Paolo Zannoni, former chairman of Italian investment banking, to head its Russian operations in February, the third leadership change in as many years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2009, United Co Rusal Plc (486) hired Bank of America Merrill Lynch, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, to replace Goldman in marketing its IPO, two people familiar with the situation said at the time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the case of MegaFon, Goldman came to the process later than the other banks, and its legal team was slowing the process down, so it did not retain its role, a person familiar with MegaFon&#8217;s point of view said, asking not to be identified because the process is private. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Chris V.

&lt;p&gt;HR Block Inc. (HRB), the largest U.S. tax
preparer, slid the most in more than five months after hiring
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) to advise on alternatives for its bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HR Block tumbled 5.4 percent to close at $16.67 in New
York, the biggest decline since April 26. The shares have gained
2.1 percent this year, compared with a 14 percent advance in the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tax preparer may drop its designation as a savings and
loan holding company after the Federal Reserve proposed rules
requiring such firms to keep additional capital, the Kansas
City, Missouri-based company said today in a statement. HR
Block is considering &#8220;a number of alternatives&#8221; for its bank
with New York-based Goldman Sachs, Chief Executive Officer Bill Cobb said in the statement without listing them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sale or wind-down of the bank could reduce HR Block&#8217;s
profit from lines of credit and prepaid cards, Mike Turner, an
analyst at Compass Point Research  Trading LLC, wrote in a
research note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We view the announcement as neutral to modestly negative
near-term,&#8221; Turner wrote. HR Block &#8220;will need to forfeit some
of the economics (and control) of the transactions that are
processed at the bank.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HR Block doesn&#8217;t &#8220;foresee regulatory flexibility&#8221;
regarding its capital levels and is considering a status change
so it would no longer fall under Fed oversight, the firm said
yesterday in a filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Closely Supervise&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Federal Reserve will closely supervise and likely
restrict other capital allocation decisions, including stock
repurchases, acquisitions and other forms of strategic
investment,&#8221; HR Block said in the filing. &#8220;Such regulatory
constraints are inconsistent with our strategic plans,
operational needs and growth objectives.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tax preparer joins insurers that are also working to
avoid the increased regulation that comes with bank status.
MetLife Inc. (MET), the largest U.S. life insurer, is seeking to sell
deposits to General Electric Co. and drop its designation as a
bank holding company after regulators blocked the firm from
repurchasing shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American International Group Inc. (AIG), the insurer whose
largest shareholder is the U.S., said in August it was weighing
whether to close its bank. Hartford Financial Services Group
Inc., Allstate Corp. and Ameriprise Financial Inc. have also
retreated from banking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sand Canyon &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HR Block is grappling with lost revenue from refund-
anticipation loans after U.S. regulators prompted HSBC Holdings
Plc to stop financing the products for HR Block in December
2010. In response, the company has promoted similar refund-
anticipation checks and offered them free to some clients
earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tax preparer agreed in April to pay more than $28
million to resolve Securities and Exchange Commission claims
that its Option One Mortgage Corp. unit, now known as Sand
Canyon Corp., didn&#8217;t tell stockholders it may not be able to
afford the cost of buying back faulty mortgages sold to
investors unless it gets assistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HR Block Bank had $1.2 billion in total assets and 58
employees as of June 30, according to the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp.&#8217;s website. The bank&#8217;s website advertises the
company&#8217;s Emerald prepaid cards, which Cobb said the company was
&#8220;very committed to&#8221; in a Sept. 5 conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a great source of growth for us,&#8221; Cobb said. &#8220;It&#8217;s
a great service to our clients.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gene Saffold, a former JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) managing director who served as Chicago&#8217;s chief
financial officer and a top adviser to former Mayor Richard M. Daley, has died. He was 57. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He died Oct. 8, following heart surgery, the Alexandria,
Virginia-based Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board said today
in a statement. Saffold was named a public member in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saffold pioneered a role for blacks as leaders of public-
finance investment banks, serving as a mentor to junior
colleagues. He helped spearhead a Chicago schools financial
restructuring and the raising of more than $3 billion of capital
when he was a trustee in the 1990s, said Gery Chico, a lawyer at
Chico  Nunes PC and a former top Daley aide who introduced
Saffold to the Democratic mayor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the 1990s, he was one of the leaders of the financial
renaissance of the Chicago schools,&#8221; Chico said by telephone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saffold showed a &#8220;lifetime commitment to philanthropy and
civic engagement,&#8221; Mayor Rahm Emanuel, a Democrat, said in a
statement, citing the banker&#8217;s ties to city youth centers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Gene always understood that no matter our success as
private citizens, everything we do is ultimately measured by
what we do to advance the public good,&#8221; Emanuel said. &#8220;Gene
showed a steadfast commitment to the city he loved.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Invaluable Resource&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saffold was a &#8220;wonderful human being&#8221; and &#8220;invaluable
resource,&#8221; Daley, now of counsel at the Chicago-based law firm
Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He was always innovative and forthright in his
decisions,&#8221; Daley said. &#8220;He was a great adviser to me but more
than that, a marvelous ally and friend who will be deeply
missed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saffold was born and grew up on Chicago&#8217;s South Side,
according to the Bond Buyer. It said his mother died when he
was young. His father worked as a regional manager for brewer
Anheuser-Busch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After graduating from Carleton College in Northfield,
Minnesota, and obtaining a master of business administration
from the University of Chicago, Saffold began a public-finance
career by joining Salomon Smith Barney in the mid-1980s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saffold &#8220;wanted to start at the bottom,&#8221; said Adela Cepeda, president of A.C. Advisory Inc. in Chicago. She helped
him find that job and had remained a friend as he progressed
through his career. The skills necessary to be an investment
banker came naturally to him, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Brilliant&#8217; Financier &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He had a brilliant financial mind; he could dig into the
most complex issue and get to the core of what was really
important,&#8221; Cepeda said. &#8220;And he had excellent pricing
instincts.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1991 to 1994, Saffold co-founded and helped run an
advisory firm, LS Financial Group Inc. in Chicago. After
returning to Salomon, he left the broker again in 2002 to become
national head of public finance at Bank One Corp., which was
acquired by JPMorgan. The New York-based institution has since
become the largest U.S. lender, with $2.3 trillion in assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saffold was a co-head of municipal investment banking in
New York starting in 2004, according to his page on the Linked
In website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an &#8220;interpersonal ability to bring out the best in
people,&#8221; Capeda said, Saffold mentored many public-finance
investment bankers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Mentor &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Gene&#8217;s contribution to the public-finance industry
extends beyond his distinguished career,&#8221; said Gary Hall, an
executive director in JPMorgan&#8217;s public finance group who said
in a prepared statement that he considered Saffold a mentor and
friend. He said Saffold recruited him from corporate finance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He was also dedicated to contributing to the professional
and personal development of so many in our industry,&#8221; Hall
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saffold returned to Chicago in August 2008 as managing
director for national accounts for JPMorgan before becoming the
city&#8217;s finance chief in March 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to leave a lucrative banking job to join the
Daley administration resulted from an interest in seeing the
business from all sides and in helping his city cope with
pressures stemming from the financial crisis, Cepeda said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He believed in what he did,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He felt it was
important to help the city at a critical time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Housing Trust &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since leaving City Hall in May 2011, when Daley ended 22
years as mayor, Saffold has worked as an independent consultant.
He was also a board member of the Chicago Low-Income Housing
Trust Fund, according to the muni rulemaking organization, which
governs the $3.7 trillion municipal-bond market, when he was
named to its board in an Aug. 1 announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are saddened by the loss of a friend and professional
committed to the municipal market,&#8221; Jay Goldstone, the MSRB&#8217;s
chairman and San Diego&#8217;s chief operating officer, said in a
statement. &#8220;Gene forged a distinguished career in public
finance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saffold, who was divorced, is survived by three children:
Christine, Jessica and Nathan, according to Cepeda. A memorial
service is set for tomorrow at Rockefeller Memorial Chapel on
the University of Chicago campus in Hyde Park. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Edvard Pettersson" date="Oct 10, 2012  3:18 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-10/disney-seeks-reversal-of-319-million-millionaire-loss.html"><headline>Disney Seeks Reversal of $319 Million &#8216;Millionaire&#8217; Loss</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s ABC network and
Buena Vista Television units asked a federal appeals court to
overturn a $319 million judgment won two years ago by the U.K.
creators of &#8220;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for ABC and Buena Vista argued their case today
before a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals meeting
in Pasadena, California. The Disney units claim the judge who
oversaw the trial allowed the jury to adopt a flawed reading of
the contract with Celador International Ltd., entitling the
creators to a share of ABC&#8217;s profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This case never should have gone to the jury,&#8221; Seth Waxman, a lawyer representing the Disney units, said at today&#8217;s
hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABC and Buena Vista said in their appeal that the judge
overseeing the trial committed a &#8220;cascading series of errors&#8221;
that allowed the jury to interpret the contract to mean that
Celador was entitled to a 50 percent share of both ABC&#8217;s and
Buena Vista&#8217;s profits, rather than just Buena Vista&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closely held Celador sued in 2004, claiming Buena Vista and
ABC &#8220;through a complex web of self-dealing transactions&#8221;
allowed ABC to keep the advertising revenue and pay Buena Vista
only a licensing fee equal to the cost of producing the show.
That kept Buena Vista from earning a profit from &#8220;Millionaire&#8221;
that it would have had to share with the creators, Celador said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Jury Verdict &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A jury in Riverside, California, in July 2010 agreed that
the Disney units breached the contract and awarded Celador $269
million in damages, to which U.S. District Judge Virginia A. Phillips added $50 million in pre-judgment interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Circuit Judge Andrew Kleinfeld today questioned
Celador&#8217;s lawyer, Robin Meadow, on the company&#8217;s claim that it
was harmed because ABC paid Buena Vista a fee per episode of
&#8220;Millionaire&#8221; that equaled the production cost, or about
$825,000, rather than as much as $3 million to a producer
unaffiliated with Disney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What I don&#8217;t get is why ABC can&#8217;t do that,&#8221; Kleinfeld
said. &#8220;It&#8217;s an economy of scale that Disney has. Why can&#8217;t they
use an internal company and do it cheap?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge also asked what evidence Celador provided at
trial that Buena Vista didn&#8217;t get from the network what it
should have gotten. The license fee ABC paid Buena Vista was
kept artificially low, Meadow said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;License fees are based on success, revenue is based on
success,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They flow together.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Syndication, Merchandising &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABC and Buena Vista said in their appeal that it&#8217;s industry
practice for the producer, Buena Vista, to get a licensing fee
from the network that is equal to the cost of producing a game
show. The producer makes a profit, if any, from syndicating the
show to local television stations and from other sources,
including merchandising, according to the Disney units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celador, under the 1999 agreement that gave ABC and Buena
Vista the North American rights to &#8220;Millionaire,&#8221; was entitled
to an up-front option payment and guaranteed fees for each
episode, according to the Disney units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. company also would receive 50 percent of Buena
Vista&#8217;s revenue from the show, after certain deductions
including Buena Vista&#8217;s normal distribution fees, costs and an
overhead charge equal to about 10 percent of the production
costs, according to the appeal brief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overhead charge meant Buena Vista had a deficit from
the show after its initial run on ABC, when &#8220;Millionaire&#8221;
aired as often as every night during two-week special events.
ABC canceled the show in 2002, and Buena Vista has since
produced a version of &#8220;Millionaire&#8221; for syndication, according
to the appeal by the Disney units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Slumdog Millionaire&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show&#8217;s &#8220;performance in syndication has not matched its
network success,&#8221; ABC and Buena Vista said. &#8220;The show has
earned a profit, but the margin has been too low to cover the
distribution fee for syndication specified in the rights
agreement, let alone make up the deficit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Millionaire&#8221; was first broadcast in the U.K. in 1998 and
has been carried in 106 countries, including Australia, India,
Japan, Germany and Russia, according to the creators. The show
also was featured in the movie &#8220;Slumdog Millionaire,&#8221; which
was co-produced by Celador and won eight Oscars in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celador said in its response to ABC and Buena Vista&#8217;s
appeal that it specifically wanted to make a deal directly with
ABC, not with a producer, and that the agreement it made
included 50 percent of the network&#8217;s profits from the show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;After the rights agreement had been signed, defendants
entered into a mind-boggling succession of agreements that
shuffled &#8216;Millionaire&#8217; rights and obligations among various
Disney-affiliated entities,&#8221; Celador said. The goal was &#8220;to
ensure that &#8216;Millionaire&#8217; never would earn network-run broadcast
profits for Celador to share,&#8221; Celador said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Network Promises &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. company said that, if the appeals court reverses
the jury verdict, it should also overturn the judge&#8217;s ruling
that ABC can&#8217;t be held liable for fraud. Celador alleges that
ABC induced it into making a deal by making promises the network
didn&#8217;t intend to fulfill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phillips found that the alleged fraudulent
misrepresentations were &#8220;too vague, conclusory and of the
nature of opinion to be actionable,&#8221; according to Celador&#8217;s
cross-appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Celador v. ABC, 11-55014 and 11-55172, U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) was ordered by
an Oklahoma court to pay $18.1 million to the trust fund of a
75-year-old oil heiress for selling her derivatives that she
claimed she didn&#8217;t understand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank must also pay punitive damages to the Carolyn S.
Burford Trust, which benefits the granddaughter of Oklahoma
oilman William G. Skelly, Tulsa County District Court Judge
Linda Morrissey ruled yesterday. The evidence &#8220;overwhelmingly
demonstrates the bank&#8217;s grossly negligent and reckless
administration of the trust,&#8221; Morrissey said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trust lost a &#8220;substantial&#8221; amount of money on
contracts called variable prepaid forwards, which bankers at
Bank One Trust Co. sold to Ann Fletcher in 2000 as a way to
generate more income, according to the ruling. After Bank One
Corp. merged with New York-based JPMorgan in 2004, the bank
managed the trust for two more years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This bank developed a strategy whereby they could utilize
the funds in this trust in order to purchase investment products
from their own equity division,&#8221; Erin Donovan, a lawyer in
Tulsa who represented Fletcher, said in a phone interview. &#8220;She
thought they were her friends.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank breached its fiduciary duty when it sold the
derivatives, Morrissey wrote. Bankers were given incentives to
push the variable prepaid forwards, which generated as much as
$2 million in fees, she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF), the investment
bank that&#8217;s 1/28th the size of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., is more
effectively avoiding trading losses this year than larger Wall
Street firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferies said it had a trading loss on one day in the
three months ended Aug. 31, bringing the total to three days for
the first nine months of its fiscal year, according to
regulatory filings from the New York-based bank. That compares
with 29 days of trading losses at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) in the
first six months of the year, 19 days at Morgan Stanley (MS) and
seven days for Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferies has cut its total assets by 24 percent since last
year&#8217;s third quarter amid investor concern about its holdings in
European debt. The firm&#8217;s shares declined 14 percent in November
2011 following the collapse of futures brokerage MF Global
Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ) Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, which is reviewing
Jefferies&#8217;s credit for a possible downgrade, said last month the
firm&#8217;s management is demonstrating &#8220;risk discipline&#8221; by
maintaining a &#8220;liquid, less complex&#8221; balance sheet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm is showing its &#8220;historical track record of not
overleveraging or overextending our company, our lack of
concentration,&#8221; Handler said on a conference call last month.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve had real-life stress test as an independent company that
has not been bailed out by anybody or taken taxpayer dollars
over the course of the last five years. We have a very strong
story to tell and we&#8217;ll do our best.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Knight Capital &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferies&#8217;s average daily value-at-risk, a measure of how
much the company estimates it could lose in the securities
market in a single day, increased to $10.53 million from $8.83
million in the second quarter, mainly because of an investment
in Knight Capital Group Inc. (KCG), the firm said. Excluding that
investment, average VaR fell to $8.35 million, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our VaR on a relative basis is particularly low,&#8221;
Handler said on the call. &#8220;Over the course of the last year,
we&#8217;ve shrunk our balance sheet. Our inventories are very light.
So I don&#8217;t think the increase in VaR due to Knight is really
material to overall organization.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first nine months of Jefferies&#8217;s fiscal year ended Aug.
31, and its full year concludes Nov. 30. Bigger rivals, whose
third quarters ended Sept. 30, are scheduled to report third-
quarter earnings this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferies reported total assets of $34.4 billion as of Aug.
31, compared with $2.29 trillion for JPMorgan on June 30, $948.6
billion (GS) for Goldman Sachs and $748.5 billion for Morgan Stanley. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mining boom that drove record
dealmaking in Western Australia last year is sputtering,
depriving investment banks of fees just as Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) set up offices in Perth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs opened an office in the state&#8217;s capital in
August and hired former Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) banker Peter Watson
for its natural resources team. Deutsche Bank, Germany&#8217;s biggest
lender, will return to Perth in coming months after closing an
office there in 2001, said Sydney-based spokesman Adrian Cox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firms&#8217; arrival in the region, home to some of the
world&#8217;s biggest mineral and gas deposits, coincides with a drop
in raw material prices that has curtailed mergers and caused
companies including BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) to scrap multibillion-
dollar projects. As China&#8217;s and India&#8217;s economies slow, slicing
demand for Australia&#8217;s resources, the &#8220;boom in commodity prices
is over,&#8221; said Resources Minister Martin Ferguson on Aug. 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The challenge for the big, integrated banks is that Perth
will always be a cyclical place and we believe it has switched
to the downside in the last six months,&#8221; said Justin Mannolini,
a Perth-based managing director at boutique firm Gresham
Advisory Partners Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acquisitions involving Australian natural resource
companies have more than halved this year from the same period
in 2011 to A$19.8 billion ($20.2 billion), putting deals on pace
for the slowest year since 2009. Takeovers peaked in 2011 at
almost $60 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Share sales
by such companies have fallen to $4.2 billion from $8.6 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tinkler&#8217;s Failure &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One casualty of the commodity slowdown was mining
billionaire Nathan Tinkler&#8217;s A$5.3 billion bid for Whitehaven
Coal Ltd. (WHC), which would have been Australia&#8217;s biggest takeover
this year. That deal failed after Tinkler was unable to make a
firm offer by an Aug. 24 deadline, according to Whitehaven. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tinkler was advised by UBS AG (UBSN), which along with JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) and Barclays Plc had pledged to provide A$2.5
billion in loans for the purchase, people familiar with the
matter said June 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit and Zurich-based
UBS are among international securities firms that established
offices in Perth in the last decade. Macquarie, Australia&#8217;s
biggest investment bank, has been in the city for more than 20
years. UBS&#8217;s Swiss rival Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) established
permanent staff in its Perth office at the start of this year
and Lazard Ltd. (LAZ) has been operating there since 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan run their
Western Australia operations from offices in Sydney and
Melbourne. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Minor Cost &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, the additional cost of setting up shop in Perth
may be small for global banks. Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse,
Bank of America and Lazard each have fewer than 10 investment
banking employees in their offices there, according to people
with knowledge of the firms&#8217; operations who asked not to be
identified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a July 16 internal memo announcing its Perth office,
Goldman Sachs called the city a &#8220;critical business and
financial center in Australia.&#8221; Perth accounts for significant
mergers and fundraising activity, the New-York based bank said.
Goldman Sachs plans to add equity sales, investment research and
wealth management workers in Perth, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hayley Morris, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment on the firm&#8217;s expansion in Western Australia beyond the
memo. Officials at UBS, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and Bank of
America declined to give further details on expansion plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Perth&#8217;s Rise &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Western Australia became the epicenter of a resources
bonanza as China began stepping up raw-materials purchases for
its soaring economy about 10 years ago. The state, with about a
10th of Australia&#8217;s population, accounted for nearly half of the
country&#8217;s exports in the 12 months to June 30. Some 37 percent
of companies listed on Australia&#8217;s stock exchange are based
there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the mining wealth has flowed to Perth, as workers
flocked to the liquid natural gas plants and iron ore mines
being constructed more than 800 kilometers north in the
resource-rich Pilbara region. BHP relocated management of its
iron ore unit to a new office in Perth, which opened in August,
while the Australian heads of international oil companies Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) and Chevron Corp. are based there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the cooling of China&#8217;s and India&#8217;s economies that
started in early 2010 has hurt prospects of resource companies,
and the investment banks servicing them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A variety of projects have been put on hold as spot prices
for iron ore, Australia&#8217;s biggest commodity export and a raw
material used to make steel, fell 21 percent in 2012, according
to The Steel Index Ltd. The price has rebounded since touching a
three-year low in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;More Sophisticated&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BHP in August put approvals for about $68 billion of
projects on hold -- including the Olympic Dam copper and uranium
mine, which Deutsche Bank estimated would cost $33 billion to
build. The world&#8217;s biggest miner also mothballed the expansion
of an iron ore port in Western Australia and said it would halt
output at the Gregory coking coal mine in Queensland state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG), Australia&#8217;s third-biggest iron
ore shipper, last month cut its full-year spending forecast by
26 percent, delayed expansion plans and refinanced debt to avoid
breaching terms on previous loans. Woodside Petroleum Ltd.
delayed drilling at its Pluto gas project in Western Australia,
the company said Aug. 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the slowdown, Tim Day, head of UBS&#8217;s Perth office,
said Australian companies will continue to need the services of
the big banks as cross-border MA deals increase and they seek
more diverse ways of financing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The companies have become more sophisticated in the way
they seek to fund their activities so it&#8217;s important to have
links into other areas in the region, including China,&#8221; Day
said. UBS was the top-ranked adviser on acquisitions including
Australian companies over the past five years, ahead of
Macquarie and Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Staying Power &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is whether the global banks have the will to
stay through a prolonged slump. Big securities firms have opened
offices in Perth before, only to close them again when business
slowed, said Michael Ashforth, a lawyer who opened the Perth
office of Gresham Advisory in the 1990s and now runs Macquarie&#8217;s
business there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Perth is still a relatively small town and the number of
companies that will regularly need investment banking services
is likely to remain pretty small,&#8221; Ashforth said. &#8220;I&#8217;m just
not sure the banks would be willing to sustain those costs in
this market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) hired Ahmed
Saeed to head its public sector coverage in Middle East as the
biggest U.S. bank boosts its presence in the oil-rich region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saeed joins from Nomura International Plc where he was a
managing director focusing on public sector clients in the
Middle East, JPMorgan said in an e-mailed statement today.
Previously he worked with the U.S. Department of Treasury in
Washington, D.C, and Cerberus Middle East Capital Advisors Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said in July it hired Rayan Fayez from Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. to head its investment banking business in
Saudi Arabia. In April, the bank hired Declan Hegarty as a
senior banker in the United Arab Emirates from HSBC Holdings
Plc, and appointed Abdulaziz Al Helaissi as head of its global
corporate bank for the Middle East and North Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saeed will report to Al Helaissi, who is also the country
officer for Saudi Arabia, the biggest Arab economy that&#8217;s in the
process of opening up its stock market to foreign investors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iraq awarded CH2M Hill a $170
million consultancy contract for a plan to inject water into
southern oil fields to help further boost crude production,
according to South Oil Co. Director General Dhia Jaafar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq&#8217;s crude production will rise to as much as 6 million
barrels a day in 2015 and 10 million barrels a day by 2020,
Deputy Prime Minister Hussain al-Shahristani said in a news
conference in Baghdad today. That&#8217;s a more optimistic outlook
than the International Energy Agency which said yesterday that
Iraq may produce as much as 6.1 million barrels a day by 2020
and 8.3 million barrels a day by 2035. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CH2M Hill replaces Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) for the project to
inject sea water mainly into Rumaila, Zubair and West Qurna oil
fields. Talks with Exxon Mobil, which has angered the central
Iraq government by reaching separate agreements with the semi-
autonomous Kurdish authorities in the north of the country,
didn&#8217;t lead to an agreement, Zahra al-Hammadi, head of the
process department at the State Company for Oil Projects, said
in an Oct. 2 interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq holds the world&#8217;s fifth-largest crude reserves,
according to data from BP. The government is seeking
international expertise and investment to rebuild the energy
industry after decades of conflict and sanctions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country&#8217;s crude exports rose to 2.7 million barrels a
day this month after the Kurdish region resumed crude shipments
that had been halted since April because of a conflict with the
central government about oil sales, Falah al-Amri, chairman of
the State Oil Marketing Organization, said at the news
conference in Baghdad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state-run South Oil Co.&#8217;s production reached 2.25
million barrels a day and is exporting 2.2 million barrels a
day, Jaafar said. The output includes 1.4 million barrels a day
from Rumaila field, 400,000 barrels a day from West Qurna 1 and
280,000 barrels from Zubair, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq, the world&#8217;s third-largest crude exporter, pumped
3.328 million barrels a day at the end of last month, the
highest rate since 1979, according to the nation&#8217;s Oil Ministry
website. In June it surpassed Iran as the second-biggest
producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) expects
emerging markets to provide a greater share of its revenue once
the global economy recovers, after proving &#8220;resilient&#8221; in the
current crisis, Vice Chairman J. Michael Evans said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging markets may contribute growth in all three of the
bank&#8217;s basic businesses, Evans said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television from Seoul today, listing mergers and
acquisitions, asset management and securities. He declined to
give specific revenue figures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We could be in a challenging environment for the
foreseeable future,&#8221; Evans said. &#8220;If things even get a bit
better in Europe and the U.S., we can count on&#8221; emerging
markets to contribute more, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging economies have expanded at an average annual pace
of 6.2 percent during the past five years, outstripping
developed markets&#8217; 0.8 percent pace, and will grow 5.3 percent
this year, compared with 1.3 percent, according to data and
forecasts from the International Monetary Fund. The MSCI
Emerging Markets Index (MXEF) has climbed 8.3 percent this year,
compared with an 11 percent gain in the MSCI World (MXWO) Index of
developed countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weakness in global markets has made it easier for China to
shift toward an economic-growth model that&#8217;s less dependent on
exports and more on domestic demand, said Evans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country is responding to the slowdown in the U.S. and
Europe with &#8220;significant structural reform,&#8221; Evans, who
oversees the New York-based bank&#8217;s businesses in emerging
markets, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television today
from Seoul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Growth Model &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It would have been a more painful transition if that
transition was required in a stronger market, particularly in
the Western world,&#8221; Evans said. In &#8220;the last four or five
years, China has had an opportunity to observe that the export-
driven model of growth is no longer a sustainable model.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Hu Jintao pledged last month to boost domestic
demand and promote more balanced growth as a slowdown in exports
puts pressure on the world&#8217;s second-largest economy. Spending on
roads, bridges, subways and other public-works projects surged
in 2009 and 2010 as much of a 4 trillion-yuan ($636 billion)
stimulus and an unprecedented expansion in bank lending was
directed toward local government projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a Monday in July, Ahmed Mansoor sat in his study in Dubai and made the mistake of clicking on a Microsoft Word attachment that arrived in an e-mail, labeled &#8220;very important&#8221; in Arabic, from a sender he thought he recognized. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With that click, the pro-democracy activist unwittingly downloaded spyware that seized on a flaw in the Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) program to take over his computer and record every keystroke. The hackers infiltrated his digital life so deeply they still accessed his personal e-mail even after he changed his password. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since then, Mansoor, 42, an electrical engineer and father of four, says he has suffered two beatings by thugs in September during his campaign for citizens&#8217; civil rights in the Persian Gulf federation of the United Arab Emirates. While those assailants remain unknown, researchers say they&#8217;ve figured out what was behind the virtual assault. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The spyware that penetrated his laptop appears to be a Western-made surveillance tool sold to police and intelligence agencies that&#8217;s so powerful it can turn on webcams and microphones and grab documents off hard drives, according to the findings of a study being published today by the University of Toronto Munk School of Global Affairs&#8217; Citizen Lab. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bolivia plans to meet with investors
next week to gauge demand for the South American country&#8217;s first
overseas bond sale since the 1920s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government hired Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. to arrange the meetings, according to three
investors contacted by the banks. The discussions, which are
scheduled for Oct. 15 to Oct. 19, will take place in Europe, the
U.S. and Latin America, according to the investors, who asked
not to be identified because the discussions are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging-market countries that have never sold debt or last
did so years ago are issuing bonds to take advantage of the
lowest borrowing costs on record. The yield on emerging-market
debt fell to a record low 4.68 percent last week, according to
JPMorgan Chase  Co., as investors looked for alternatives to
near-zero interest rates in the U.S. and Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People are looking at countries off the beaten path to
pick up some yield,&#8221; Alejandro Urbina, who manages and gives
advice on $800 million of emerging-market assets at Silva
Capital Management, said in a telephone interview from Chicago.
&#8220;They&#8217;re coming at a good time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bolivia plans to raise as much as $500 million selling
bonds at a yield below 10 percent to fund mining and electricity
projects, Finance Minister Luis Arce told reporters in Uruguay
on March 16. A press official at Bolivia&#8217;s Finance Ministry
declined to comment in a phone interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Paraguay, Zambia &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerrie McHugh, a spokeswoman at Bank of America, declined
to comment, citing company policy in an e-mail. Goldman Sachs
press officials didn&#8217;t respond to calls and an e-mail message
seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paraguay plans to sell its first global bonds by mid-
January, President Federico Franco said last month. The sale
would follow Zambia&#8217;s debut in the bond market in September with
a $750 million Eurobond offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angola, which shares Bolivia&#8217;s BB- rating from Standard 
Poor&#8217;s, three levels below investment grade, sold $1 billion of
debt in the form of loan participation notes due in seven years
to yield 7 percent in August for its first international issue.
Guatemala and Aruba also returned to the bond market this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling SA, the world&#8217;s second-largest Coca-Cola bottler, plans to move its main stock listing from Athens to London as Greece&#8217;s largest company by market value flees the epicenter of Europe&#8217;s debt crisis. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The move will make it eligible for inclusion in the benchmark FTSE 100 Index. A new company established in Switzerland by one of the bottler&#8217;s main shareholders will make a share-exchange offer for Coca-Cola Hellenic and seek a primary listing in London, according to an Athens bourse filing today. Coca-Cola HBC AG will also seek to list in New York. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The move comes as European officials try to convince investors that Greece&#8217;s future belongs in the euro region three years after the country&#8217;s debt crisis broke out. While German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited Athens to assure Greek citizens she wants them to stay in the euro, the largest opposition party says Greece should renege on all its bailout agreements and a report today showed unemployment rose above 25 percent in July. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The move will help disassociate CCH from problems related to Greece&#8221; including a potential exit from the euro area and related capital controls, said Paris Mantzavras, an analyst at Pantelakis Securities in Athens. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein said he would be willing to pay higher U.S. taxes if he thought it would help reduce the national debt. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;No one is so unpatriotic that they wouldn&#8217;t pay a little bit more to resolve it,&#8221; Blankfein, 58, said today in an interview on CNBC. He said that no one would be willing to pay higher taxes unless they&#8217;re sure it was part of a comprehensive solution to the country&#8217;s budget. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blankfein discussed the U.S.&#8217;s fiscal challenges with Erskine Bowles, a Democrat and former White House chief of staff, and Alan Simpson, a former Republican Senator, who led a deficit-reduction committee that failed to win congressional support in 2010. All three emphasized the importance of Congress reaching a compromise to cut spending, raise revenue and encourage economic growth. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If there were &#8220;some compromise laid out, what kind of a stimulus do you think that would provide?&#8221; asked Blankfein. &#8220;I&#8217;d be a buyer of the market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blankfein and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, both of whom have been grilled by members of Congress in recent years about their own businesses, have turned the tables recently, publicly urging politicians to reach an agreement to reduce the U.S. debt. Dimon, 56, said yesterday the economy &#8220;would be booming&#8221; if Congress had passed the so-called Bowles-Simpson plan last year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Left-Center&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have a stake in this country like everybody else and I think we have the experience and the competence to let people know the consequences&#8221; of failing to address deficit spending and the national debt, Blankfein said. Blankfein, who backed Hillary Clinton&#8217;s campaign for president in 2008 and hasn&#8217;t endorsed a candidate this year, said he&#8217;s &#8220;on the left-center side of things&#8221; politically. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Simpson and Bowles, whose plan was defeated by a 382-38 vote in the House of Representatives in March, are meeting this week with a bipartisan group of eight senators seeking to avert a &#8220;fiscal cliff&#8221; of tax increases and automatic spending cuts at year&#8217;s end. Simpson, 81, and Bowles, 67, also plan to begin a $30 million campaign to build public support for a debt deal. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The two have signed up about 75 to 80 CEOs for a fiscal leadership council, said Bowles, who serves on the boards of Morgan Stanley (MS) and Facebook Inc. and whose wife is a member of the JPMorgan board. Blankfein and Dimon are among the CEOs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Asked by CNBC&#8217;s Steve Liesman if he might serve as U.S. Treasury secretary, Bowles said &#8220;I expect to be living in North Carolina for the rest of my life.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Mutual Distrust &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Simpson said that using business people to win support didn&#8217;t guarantee success. &#8220;Politicians don&#8217;t like or believe the business people and the business people don&#8217;t like or believe the politicians,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The stock market&#8217;s recent gains indicate that traders are too comfortable with the idea that Congress will avert the fiscal cliff by the end of the year, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investors &#8220;really believe honestly that no Congress could be this stupid, and by God, they can,&#8221; Simpson said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In response to a question from Liesman, Blankfein said he&#8217;s &#8220;not really concerned about the revelations&#8221; in a book due Oct. 22 by a former Goldman Sachs employee who has publicly criticized the firm. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you I&#8217;m not looking forward to the hoopla&#8221; that will surround the book&#8217;s release, he said, adding that he hasn&#8217;t read it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s investigation of claims made by the former employee, Greg Smith, in a New York Times op-ed earlier this year didn&#8217;t turn up any evidence to support his allegations, Blankfein said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Incomplete Information&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still &#8220;when you think about what happened in the last four or five years, it will go into the mix,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blankfein and other executives at Goldman Sachs, the fifth- biggest U.S. bank by assets, were interrogated by the Senate&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations in April 2010. A report issued by the committee accused the firm of misleading investors into buying mortgage-linked assets just before the financial crisis, even as Goldman Sachs&#8217;s own traders were betting against them. The firm rejected the accusation, saying they were making markets for their clients. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In July 2010, Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $550 million to settle the Securities  Exchange Commission&#8217;s claim that the firm misled investors who bought a mortgage-linked investment called Abacus in 2007. The firm said in the settlement that marketing materials for the 2007 deal contained &#8220;incomplete information.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon, who spoke yesterday in Washington at an event hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations, was questioned by the House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee in June over his bank&#8217;s $5.8 billion loss on derivative bets. JPMorgan is the biggest U.S. bank by assets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Christine Harper in New York at  charper@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: David Scheer at  dscheer@bloomberg.net. &lt;/p&gt;

1.55 billion euros ($2 billion) of loans to back the company&#8217;s
move out of Greece. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The financing is being arranged for Coca-Cola HBC AG, a new
company established in Switzerland to take over the Greek
business, and comprises 550 million euros of acquisition
financing, 500 million euros of revolving credit facilities and
a 500 million-euro term loan to refinance debt, according to an
Athens exchange filing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, advised by Credit Suisse Group AG, plans a
primary listing in London and potentially New York, it said.
Listing in London &#8220;will give us greater recognition among
international investors, will increase the liquidity of our
stock and improve our access to the international equity and
debt markets,&#8221; Dimitris Lois, Coca-Cola HBC&#8217;s chief executive
officer, told reporters on a conference call today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola HBC shares fell 4.9 percent today to 15.66 euros
at the close of trading in Athens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acquisition loan will be used for the cash component of
the offer if it&#8217;s needed, and the revolver and refinancing lines
will replace Coca-Cola Hellenic&#8217;s existing debt if required,
according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both loans mature in July 2014 or 18 months after the
company issues a prospectus for the London Stock Exchange
listing, whichever is sooner. The refinancing loan matures in
March 2014 or at the time the acquisition facility matures,
whichever is later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under a revolver, money can be borrowed again once it&#8217;s
repaid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola HBC may enter the FTSE 100 if successful, as its
market value is equivalent to about 4.4 billion pounds ($7.1
billion). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s Fabrice Tourre will go to trial July 15 in the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission&#8217;s lawsuit accusing him of misleading
investors in a collateralized debt obligation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in Manhattan set the
trial date today at the end of a hearing in which an SEC lawyer
argued that she should reinstate some claims against Tourre that
another judge dismissed earlier in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones threw out some
of the SEC&#8217;s claims after Tourre argued that he couldn&#8217;t be held
liable under U.S. securities law for transactions that occurred
outside the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC argued today that the claims should be reinstated
because of a recent appeals court ruling that applied a broader
definition of &#8220;domestic securities transaction&#8221; than the one
used by Jones. Tourre&#8217;s case was assigned to Forrest last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre, 33, who is studying for a Ph.D. in economics at the
University of Chicago, wasn&#8217;t present in the courtroom today.
His lawyer, Pamela Chepiga, told Forrest that she will check
with her client to make sure there is no conflict between his
exams and the trial date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC sued Goldman Sachs and Tourre in April 2010. The
New York-based investment bank agreed in July 2010 to pay
$550 million to settle the allegations against it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Tourre, 10-03229, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Financial
Officer Douglas Braunstein is considering leaving his position
and may seek a role in the firm&#8217;s investment bank, where he
previously led dealmaking, according to a person with direct
knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Braunstein, who was promoted to CFO in June 2010, is likely
to remain in that role for at least several months, said the
person, who requested anonymity because a decision on the move
isn&#8217;t final. The finance chief had reported to Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon until July, when Matt Zames, 41, became his
boss and co-chief operating officer amid management changes in
the wake of a $5.8 billion trading loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Braunstein, 51, didn&#8217;t respond to a phone call seeking
comment. The Wall Street Journal reported late yesterday that he
is expected to leave his post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trading loss, tied to wrong-way bets on derivatives, is
being reviewed by agencies including the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.K.
Financial Services Authority and the U.S. Senate Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations. An internal probe showed traders
in London priced their books &#8220;aggressively&#8221; and may have tried
to hide the full extent of their losses, the company has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FBI is focusing its inquiry on four former London-based
executives in the bank&#8217;s chief investment office, where the loss
occurred, and the bureau could make arrests in the next several
months, the New York Times reported late yesterday, citing
officials briefed on the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;London Whale &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newspaper said the FBI is scrutinizing former JPMorgan
traders including Bruno Iksil, nicknamed the London Whale
because his wagers were big enough to move the market, as well
as his boss, Javier Martin-Artajo, and former Europe CIO head
Achilles Macris. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for Macris, 51, declined to comment and an
attorney for Iksil didn&#8217;t respond to requests for comment,
according to the New York Times. Greg Campbell, a lawyer for
Martin-Artajo, said his client &#8220;is confident&#8221; that he will be
cleared of wrongdoing after a &#8220;fair reconstruction of these
complex events is completed,&#8221; the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of personnel changes stemmed from the botched
bets, starting with the resignation in May of Chief Investment
Officer Ina Drew, 56, less than a week after Dimon, 56,
disclosed the trading loss. Her exit was followed by that of
Iksil, Martin-Artajo and Macris. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Senate Panel &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon and Drew are among executives who have been
questioned by aides to the Senate panel, overseen by Chairman
Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, people familiar with the
discussions said. Joseph Bonocore, a former CIO finance chief,
and David Olson, an ex-credit trader in the unit, also have been
interviewed, said the people, who asked not to be identified
because the talks are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonocore and Olson now work at New York-based Citigroup
Inc. Shannon Bell, a spokeswoman for that bank, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two senior managers last week also disclosed that they
intend to leave the company. Irene Tse, 43, who ran the CIO for
North America under Drew, told employees that she&#8217;s resigning
and people familiar with the matter have said she plans to start
a hedge fund. Former Chief Risk Officer Barry Zubrow, 59, who
runs JPMorgan&#8217;s lobbying operation, announced Oct. 5 that he
will retire at year-end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is scheduled to report third-quarter results
tomorrow before U.S. markets open. The lender may say net income
climbed 14 percent to $4.87 billion, according to the average
estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve will struggle to end its quantitative easing program, said Gary D. Cohn, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s president and chief operating officer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I understand what they&#8217;re trying to do and I will tell you this, this is going to be difficult to stop or to exit,&#8221; Cohn told Bloomberg Television today in Tokyo. &#8220;At the end of this -- there will be an end to quantitative easing -- we will have to go through the pains of stopping quantitative easing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Fed last month announced its third round of large-scale asset purchases since 2008, with no limit this time on the ultimate amount it would buy or the duration of the program. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke says that stimulus will be expanded until policy makers see &#8220;sustained improvement&#8221; in the labor market and that the strategy works in part by boosting the prices of assets such as equities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We know the Fed wants to create job growth,&#8221; Cohn said. &#8220;We know that the Fed wants to create asset appreciation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. Chief Executive Officer Brian T. Moynihan said in a separate interview that the U.S. central bank is &#8220;working hard&#8221; to boost demand that&#8217;s less than potential and that its exit plan &#8220;is something to worry about down the road.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Confidence Deficit &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Right now we&#8217;ve got to make sure we continue to push confidence,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s a problem that we&#8217;ll face more in the future than we face today.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fed Vice Chairman Janet Yellen said in Tokyo yesterday that policy makers have a plan to normalize monetary policy when the time comes. After it begins to raise its benchmark interest rate from near zero, the U.S. central bank has indicated it wants to sell many of the assets on its balance sheet in a &#8220;very gradual and predictable way,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We know that this will be a challenging feat to normalize monetary policy,&#8221; she said, noting bank balance sheets may be vulnerable to any sharp increase in rates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bank of Israel Governor Stanley Fischer, a former Citigroup Inc. executive, said in Tokyo that central banks know what to do when inflation accelerates. &#8220;You just reverse the operation, it&#8217;s not technically difficult,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I have enough belief in my central bank colleagues to believe that if they see inflation beginning to get underway, they will react and stop it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Not Alone &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Fed isn&#8217;t alone in easing monetary policy, with the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan (8301) both adding to stimulus in the past three months. The ECB cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low of 0.75 percent and pledged to buy the bonds of governments that agree to austerity conditions. The Bank of Japan last month boosted its asset-purchase fund by 10 trillion yen ($128 billion) and abandoned a minimum yield for the bonds it purchases. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;They are all kind of doing the same thing so it has less impact than if other players were on the sideline,&#8221; said Cohn. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While he praised ECB President Mario Draghi for doing a &#8220;spectacular job&#8221; and removing &#8220;a lot of risk off the table,&#8221; Cohn said the ECB can&#8217;t &#8220;deal with the real long-term problem of Europe, which is economic growth.&#8221; Draghi worked at Goldman Sachs from 2002 to 2005. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Lehman Moment &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cohn echoed his June view that Europe needs a &#8220;moment&#8221; like Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.&#8217;s 2008 bankruptcy to solve its debt stress. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure what the moment will be, but I do believe there&#8217;s going to be a moment when everyone takes a deep breath and says &#8216;we&#8217;ve got to fix this situation,&#8217;&#8221; Cohn said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said there is a &#8220;small&#8221; probability the euro-area will stick together, saying it&#8217;s more likely than not that some countries will exit the 17-nation bloc to pursue growth. Greece, for example, could enjoy a &#8220;thriving, booming economy based on tourism&#8221; within five years if they devalued, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund under way in Tokyo, Cohn said the world economy is in a &#8220;tough place&#8221; and lacks leadership. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Europe&#8217;s strains, a slowdown in China and the U.S.&#8217;s fiscal challenges all &#8220;point you to be cautious,&#8221; Moynihan said. The U.S. economy &#8220;continues to grow&#8221; and Europe&#8217;s problems will &#8220;ebb and flow,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Sara Eisen in Tokyo at  seisen2@bloomberg.net; Simon Kennedy in Tokyo at  skennedy4@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Paul Panckhurst at  ppanckhurst@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) President
and Chief Operating Officer Gary D. Cohn sees a &#8220;small&#8221;
probability that the euro area will stick together, saying it&#8217;s
more likely that some countries will exit to pursue growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In federalism, you create a unified Europe, where the
countries that are thriving because of the currency subsidize
the countries that are contracting because of the currency,&#8221;
Cohn said in an interview in Tokyo today. &#8220;I would put a
relatively small probability of that happening.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Central Bank program pledging unlimited
support to debt-burdened nations if they sign up for economic
reforms deals with the &#8220;pre-existing condition&#8221; but hasn&#8217;t
addressed the lack of growth, Cohn said. ECB President Mario Draghi pledged to &#8220;do whatever it takes&#8221; to defend the euro as
officials seek to stem the debt crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe still needs a &#8220;moment&#8221; similar to Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.&#8217;s 2008 bankruptcy, Cohn said, reiterating comments
made in June. The 17 countries that share the euro must find
ways to support economic growth in the weaker members, he had
said at that time, adding that austerity programs don&#8217;t support
expansion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Southern Europe has no ability to grow the economy with
the fixed exchange-rate environment they&#8217;re in,&#8221; he said today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO) is in discussions to
invest about $10 million in Spotify Ltd., the subscription
music-streaming service, according to two people with knowledge
of the discussions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An agreement isn&#8217;t assured, said one of the people, who
sought anonymity because the talks are private. An agreement may
be reached in the next few weeks, Sky News reported yesterday,
citing people close to the beverage company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola, owner of the world&#8217;s most-valuable brand, has
increased its ties to entertainment so it can market products to
young consumers in a subtle way. The Atlanta-based company
reached a deal in April to add Spotify to its Internet
marketing, after a successful collaboration with record labels
to produce the 2010 World Cup anthem &#8220;Wavin&#8217; Flag.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The song by singer-songwriter K&#8217;naan was a No. 1 iTunes
download in at least 17 counties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola fell 1.2 percent to $38.09 yesterday in New York.
The shares have gained 8.9 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closely held Spotify is seeking to raise $100 million to
$200 million from investors in a funding round that would value
the company as high as $4 billion, people with knowledge of the
situation said in May. The company was recruiting investors
including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the people said then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The service, based in London, has been expanding to new
territories and seeking to add artists as it faces competition
from rivals including Rdio Inc. It raised $100 million last year
from investors including DST Global, Accel Partners and Kleiner
Perkins Caufield  Byers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk increased, reversing a decline from the lowest level in
four days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, increased
0.7 basis point to a mid-price of 98 basis points at 4:15 p.m.
in New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The swaps measure rose as JP Morgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Wells
Fargo  Co. reported shrinking net interest margins, a gauge of
the profitability of lending. The index had earlier reached as
low as 95.2 basis points after the Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan preliminary October consumer sentiment index increased
to 83.1 from 78.3 the previous month, the highest since
September 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Part of it has to do with some uncertainty with respect
to earnings: things will pop in one direction and then fade,&#8221;
Marc Pinto, head of corporate bond strategy at Susquehanna
International Group LLP, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;Next
week we should get a fair amount of data so that we can see more
discernible trends.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The credit-swaps index typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wells Fargo &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost to protect against losses on the debt of Wells
Fargo rose 1 basis point to 84.5 basis points at 4:07 p.m.,
according to data provider CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill
Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contracts tied to Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) widened, a day after
Japan&#8217;s Softbank Corp. (9984) confirmed it&#8217;s in talks to take a stake
of as much as 75 percent of the third-largest U.S. wireless
carrier. Sprint&#8217;s swaps rose 25.9 basis points to 388.3 basis
points at 3:30 p.m. in New York, CMA data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gulfport Energy Corp. (GPOR) sold $250 million of eight-year,
dollar-denominated bonds to repay borrowings and prefund
drilling expenditures, according to a person familiar with the
offering, who asked not to be identified because terms aren&#8217;t
set. The 7.75 percent notes were priced to yield 672 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average relative yield on investment-grade debt fell 2
basis points, led by communications and energy companies, whose
spreads narrowed 2 basis points, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The relative yield on speculative-grade debt was
unchanged, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S. bank by assets, reported record third-quarter profit that beat analysts&#8217; estimates as mortgage revenue soared 72 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Net income rose 34 percent to $5.71 billion, or $1.40 a share, from $4.26 billion, or $1.02, a year earlier, the New York-based company said today in a statement. Earnings, which included a loss on accounting adjustments, beat the average estimate of $1.20 among 30 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is still recovering from a wrong-way bet on credit derivatives that cost the bank about $6.25 billion through the first nine months of this year, not including what the bank said was a &#8220;modest&#8221; additional loss in the third quarter. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56, got help restoring investor confidence from historically low interest rates and government programs that fueled demand for home loans. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The housing market has turned the corner,&#8221; Dimon said in the statement. &#8220;We were encouraged that credit trends continued to modestly improve, and, as a result, the firm reduced the related loan-loss reserves by $900 million.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Low interest rates have also been hurting the industry as banks earn less on the money they lend. The bank&#8217;s net interest margin, which measures profitability on loans and other interest-bearing assets, dropped to 2.43 percent from 2.66 percent a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), whose trading
loss of more than $6.2 billion was fueled by the adoption of a
flawed mathematical formula that understated the risks, is
trying yet another one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said today it started using a new formula to judge
the risk of the derivatives position, at least the third such
model it&#8217;s used this year, when it moved most of the contracts
to the investment-bank unit. The new analysis cut the firm&#8217;s
calculation of overall value-at-risk, or VaR, by $36 million, or
24 percent, to $115 million in the third quarter, the New York-
based bank said today on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s switch to a new risk model in January may have
helped fuel the trading loss at the chief investment office,
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon told the Senate Banking
Committee in June. Dimon said May 10 that the bank had reviewed
the effectiveness of that VaR model, deemed it &#8220;inadequate&#8221;
and decided to return to the previous version. Restoring the use
of the earlier model meant the risk was twice what the bank had
reported in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;VaR models change almost every time we talk,&#8221; Dimon said
today in a call with journalists. &#8220;When we moved it to the
investment bank, they adopted, particularly for the synthetic
credit portfolio -- and there are some other changes too -- the
investment bank&#8217;s model, which we think was the best one.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The January switch and the timing of the firm&#8217;s disclosures
are the focus of an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange
Commission as the U.S. examines how long executives knew about
the CIO&#8217;s swelling bets and losses. VaR is an internal estimate
of the maximum a portfolio could lose on 95 percent of days, or
the minimum it could lose on 5 percent of days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;More Frequent&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These kinds of changes seem to be a little more frequent
than what I would normally be used to seeing,&#8221; said Cliff Rossi, a former chief risk officer for Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s Consumer
Lending Group. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
&#8220;will be wanting to take a much closer look at the validity and
the stability of that model and its underlying assumptions to
make sure that what they&#8217;ve got in there now is better than what
they had in the last two iterations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bryan Hubbard, an OCC spokesman, didn&#8217;t immediately respond
to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm said today that the investment bank unit&#8217;s
position assumed from the CIO had a &#8220;modest&#8221; loss in the third
quarter. The CIO had a loss of about $449 million in the period
as it &#8220;effectively closed out&#8221; its position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Still Unaware&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model that was implemented in January &#8220;did effectively
increase the amount of risk this unit was able to take,&#8221; Dimon
told the Senate panel in June. On April 13, when he downplayed
the risks of trades on a call with analysts, &#8220;we were still
unaware that the model might have contributed to the problem,&#8221;
Dimon testified. &#8220;So when we found out later on, we went back
to the old model.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon told lawmakers in June that the models &#8220;never are
totally accurate in capturing changes in business,
concentration, liquidity or geopolitics.&#8221; JPMorgan uses data
going back one year, Dimon has said, so the VaR figure might
fall just because a volatile week was no longer included in the
calculation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is all nonsense,&#8221; said Steve Allen, former head of
risk methodology for JPMorgan who retired in 2004. &#8220;Because we
know that the risk positions are illiquid, we know with
certainty that these numbers are irrelevant to the risk of the
position.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Another Example&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has added a warning in its most recent quarterly
report that risk models are continually tweaked to account for
&#8220;improvements&#8221; in modeling techniques, and SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro has publicly asserted that banks should disclose
significant changes and the reasons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s another example of the fact that banks are very
opaque, they&#8217;ve always been opaque, they continue to be opaque,
and running around spending a lot of time analyzing changes in
the little bit of data that they give out is not really
contributing very much to the knowledge base of the world,&#8221;
Allen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While models must be kept up to date to reflect market
conditions, too many significant changes may destroy their
usefulness, said Rossi, who is now executive-in-residence at the
Robert H. Smith School of Business at the University of
Maryland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These are important benchmarks by which you&#8217;re setting
risk tolerance in your trading book,&#8221; said Rossi. &#8220;If things
are shifting around, it&#8217;s like having a compass that&#8217;s spinning
around because you can&#8217;t anchor it to something. That&#8217;s
problematic from my standpoint.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Wells Fargo
 Co. (WFC), prompted by U.S. regulators, took almost $1.4 billion in
charge-offs on home-equity loans and other mortgages to
borrowers who filed for bankruptcy protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan wrote off $825 million in loans in the third
quarter, 87 percent of which were home-equity loans, the bank
said today while reporting third-quarter earnings. The guidance
by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency led Wells Fargo
to increase net loan charge-offs by $567 million, which was
covered by reserves, the San Francisco-based bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OCC issued guidance in July on how banks should account
for so-called troubled debt restructurings, or TDRs, if the
lender doesn&#8217;t expect payment in full of both principal and
interest. The move reflects the tougher stance by new
Comptroller Thomas Curry, who took over in March, said Clifford
Rossi, a finance professor at the University of Maryland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There has been a sea change with Curry there,&#8221; Rossi
said. &#8220;From a supervisory standpoint, the OCC is going to start
to scrutinize these type of positions more.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s nonaccrual loans increased by $1.7 billion
because of the decision, the New York-based bank said. Wells
Fargo moved $1.4 billion in loans to nonaccrual status,
including $1 billion in first mortgages and $262 million of so-
called junior liens, the company said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We would expect, given the characteristics of the loans
we were asked to charge off, that we will receive that value
back in the form of principal payments over time,&#8221; JPMorgan
Chief Financial Officer Doug Braunstein told reporters on a
conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Accounting Clarifications&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulatory change caused JPMorgan&#8217;s home-equity charge-
off rate, which excludes so-called purchase credit-impaired
loans, to surge to 6.22 percent from 2.82 percent a year ago and
2.53 percent in the second quarter. Without the charge, and
excluding PCI loans, the charge-off rate would have been 2.23
percent, the largest U.S. bank said in an investor presentation
on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Braunstein said that 97 percent of the loans are currently
paying, with about half paying on time for more than two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the OCC directive will probably increase third-
quarter charge-offs and non-performing assets, it isn&#8217;t
&#8220;fundamentally at odds&#8221; with a broader pattern of improved
asset quality in U.S. banks&#8217; mortgage books, Fitch Ratings said
in a note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We view these prospective losses as reflections of
accounting clarifications rather than economically significant
changes,&#8221; Fitch said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Lenders &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc., the third-biggest U.S. bank, had $37.2
billion of home-equity loans at the end of June, according to a
quarterly filing. About $1.6 billion of the loans, or 4.3
percent, were more than 30 days late, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The home-equity loans are in Citi Holdings, the division
created by Chief Executive Officer Vikram Pandit to hold assets
tagged for sale. Citigroup has sold about $14 billion of
mortgages since 2010, about 60 percent of which were delinquent,
CFO John Gerspach said last month. The New York-based bank
reports third-quarter earnings Oct. 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the lender that rescued Countrywide
Financial Corp. in 2008, had $118 billion in home-equity loans
at June 30, with 1.1 percent at least 30 days overdue, the
Charlotte, North Carolina-based company said in a July 18
presentation. Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. lender,
reports earnings Oct. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Playing Catch-Up&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bancorp, the nation&#8217;s fifth-largest lender by
deposits, had $17.5 billion in home-equity and second mortgages
at June 30, according to a filing from the Minneapolis-based
company. About 1.9 percent were marked as overdue or non-
performing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some banks have been &#8220;playing catch-up&#8221; on home-equity
losses, said Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Virginia-based bank
consultant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There has been a sense overall that banks in general and
some banks in particular have not reserved sufficiently for
future losses,&#8221; Ely said of their home-equity portfolios. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators may also be seeking to adjust for banks cutting
back too much on loan-loss reserves in general, he said.
Comptroller Curry said on Sept. 20 that he was concerned banks
were getting too much of their profit gains from slashing
reserves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Very Sensible&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OCC said in the June accounting advisory that in cases
of TDRs, banks should &#8220;charge-off the excess of the loan&#8217;s
carrying amount over the fair value of the collateral as
uncollectible and the bank should place the remaining balance on
nonaccrual.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawrence White, an economics professor at New York
University&#8217;s Stern School of Business, said the change is &#8220;very
sensible.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You can&#8217;t have banks doing the extend-and-pretend game
where they ignore changed circumstances in the hope that maybe
something will work out,&#8221; White said. &#8220;It&#8217;s just not a good
way for a prudentially regulated financial institution to be
behaving.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Lisa Abramowicz" date="Oct 12, 2012 11:30 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-12/vanguard-to-jpmorgan-dodging-neediest-borrowers-credit-markets.html"><headline>Vanguard to JPMorgan Dodging Neediest Borrowers: Credit Markets</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Investors from Vanguard Group Inc.
to JPMorgan Chase  Co. are shunning bonds from the neediest
borrowers as a slowing economy sends the default rate for
companies that ratings firms deem to be in &#8220;poor standing&#8221; to
the highest level since 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanguard&#8217;s $18.4 billion fund that buys junk bonds is
&#8220;incrementally taking down risk on a credit-by-credit basis,&#8221;
said Dan Newhall, principal at the biggest U.S. mutual-fund
firm. J.P. Morgan Asset Management has been reducing debt from
companies more affected by lower consumer spending and has
&#8220;dramatically&#8221; decreased holdings of securities ranked CCC
since 2009, said Bill Morgan, a high-yield fund manager. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waning demand signals turbulence in the $173 billion
bottom-tier of the junk market, where Standard  Poor&#8217;s says the
default rate of borrowers from Energy Future Holdings Corp. to
Caesars Entertainment Corp. (CZR) reached 27.2 percent in August, up
10 percentage points from a year earlier. Returns are slowing
even as prices hover at about 14-month highs, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s not a whole lot of upside at these average
prices,&#8221; said Newhall, who spoke on behalf of Wellington
Management Co., which manages the Vanguard fund on a daily
basis. &#8220;Demand from funds and institutional buyers is far
outstripping the net high-yield new supply, and that&#8217;s leading
people to bid up the prices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Defaults Rise &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With sales of high-yield bonds proceeding at a record pace,
borrowers graded B and lower sold the greatest proportion of new
junk debt in September in 12 months, accounting for 37.7 percent
of the month&#8217;s issuance, SP data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obligations in the bottom ratings tier are &#8220;judged to be
of poor standing and are subject to very high credit risk,&#8221;
according to Moody&#8217;s Investors Service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as bond investors accept looser terms from
speculative-grade companies, SP has tallied 61 defaults this
year, compared with 34 in the same period of 2011, the ratings
firm said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given where valuations are, investors have to be much
more careful,&#8221; said Andrew Jessop, a high-yield fund manager at
Pacific Investment Management Co., which oversees the world&#8217;s
biggest bond fund. &#8220;In the CCC sector, you have to be quite
cautious with the companies you&#8217;re buying.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Credit Swaps &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in credit markets, the cost of protecting
corporate debt from default in the U.S. declined. The Markit CDX
North America Investment Grade Index, which investors use to
hedge against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness,
decreased 0.7 basis point to a mid-price of 96.6 basis points as
of 11:17 a.m. in New York, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measure typically falls as investor confidence improves
and rises as it deteriorates. Credit-default swaps pay the buyer
face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the
value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000
annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. two-year interest-rate swap spread, a measure of
debt market stress, fell 1.44 basis point to 10.81 basis points
as of 11:16 a.m. in New York. That&#8217;s the lowest level on an
intra-day basis since March 2010 for the gauge, which narrows
when investors favor assets such as company debentures and
widens when they seek the perceived safety of government
securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Bonds &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds of JPMorgan are the most actively traded dollar-
denominated corporate securities by dealers today, with 51
trades of $1 million or more as of 11:22 a.m. in New York,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The biggest U.S. bank
by assets reported record third-quarter profit today that beat
analysts&#8217; estimates as mortgage revenue soared 72 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world economy will grow 3.3 percent this year, the
slowest since the 2009 recession, and 3.6 percent next year, the
International Monetary Fund said Oct. 9, compared with July
predictions of 3.5 percent in 2012 and 3.9 percent in 2013. The
Washington-based lender now sees &#8220;alarmingly high&#8221; risks of a
steeper slowdown, with a one-in-six chance of growth slipping
below 2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third-quarter profits and sales for companies in the SP
500 (SPX) probably fell in unison for the first time in three years,
according to analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Per-
share earnings may have dropped 1.7 percent on average after
they were little changed in the second quarter. Sales may have
slipped 0.6 percent, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Record Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returns of 0.48 percent this month on the lowest tier of
junk bonds bring gains to 16.7 percent for 2012 on the Bank of
America Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield, CCC and Lower Rated
index. That compares with 15.9 percent this year on the SP 500
index and 12.7 percent for all junk bonds. The debt returned
1.58 percent in the corresponding period of September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the fundamental credit quality of high-yield notes
remains strong in general, &#8220;demand from funds and institutional
buyers is far outstripping the net high-yield new supply,&#8221; said
Newhall, the head of oversight and manager search at Vanguard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Hong, the Vanguard High-Yield Corporate Fund (VWEHX)
manager, &#8220;is concerned about the high prices of some of these
bonds that people are willing to pay today,&#8221; Newhall said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average price on the lowest-rated bonds has risen to
91.97 cents on the dollar from 83.36 cents at the end of 2011,
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. Prices reached
92.86 cents on Sept. 19, the highest level since August 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PIK Toggles &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors funneled a record $33.8 billion into U.S. funds
that buy speculative-grade notes, JPMorgan said in a Sept. 28
report. The funds reported $1.2 billion of outflows in the
following two weeks, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales in the U.S. of junk bonds, rated below Baa3 by
Moody&#8217;s and lower than BBB- at SP, are proceeding at an
unprecedented pace, with issuance of $262.7 billion exceeding
the $210.6 billion sold in the corresponding period of 2010, the
busiest year on record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Moody&#8217;s measure of weakness in bondholder protections
included in U.S. junk-rated debt increased to 3.94 in September,
the worst since November. The gauge, known as a covenant-quality
score, compares with 3.71 in August and a 2012 average of 3.72
through last week, according to Moody&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past month, offerings of so-called payment-in-kind
notes accounted for $2.6 billion of the $6.5 billion of deals
this year, Bloomberg data show. PIK toggle bonds allow borrowers
to elect to pay interest in cash or through issuing more debt,
or a combination of the options, generally within the first few
years of the bond&#8217;s term, according to Moody&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Most Vulnerable &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are components of the market that we tend to
shun,&#8221; including PIK bonds and note sales used to pay
dividends, JPMorgan&#8217;s Morgan said in a telephone interview from
Cincinnati. &#8220;It&#8217;s just recently that we&#8217;ve started to see some
degradation in the underwriting cycle.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When relative yields contract enough, JPMorgan tends to
sell riskier holdings, which may carry the lowest ratings or be
from companies that managers view as most vulnerable, Morgan
said. Spreads on junk bonds reached 557 basis points yesterday,
down from this year&#8217;s high of 723 on June 5, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm has recently taken money out of cyclical companies
and increased debt from borrowers that are less susceptible to
consumers&#8217; willingness to spend money on discretionary items.
JPMorgan Asset Management&#8217;s junk-bond portfolio has a lower
proportion of debt with CCC and BB ratings versus comparable
indexes and a higher proportion of B rated notes, Morgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Energy Future &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 12-month-trailing default rate on the lowest-rated
speculative-grade companies compares with 17.2 percent in August
2011 and is the highest since reaching 54 percent in November
2009, SP data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $16 billion of CCC tier notes from Dallas-based Energy
Future, the electricity producer formerly known as TXU Corp.,
has lost 0.3 percent in October, while Caesars&#8217;s $6.8 billion of
the debt declined 1.13 percent, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It pays to be even more selective by credit&#8221; after this
year&#8217;s rally, Pimco&#8217;s Jessop said. &#8220;You&#8217;ll start to see
earnings will no longer be supportive for parts of the market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) raised a
$520 million collateralized loan obligation for PineBridge
Investments LLC, according to two people with knowledge of the
deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund, Galaxy XIV CLO, includes a $318.75 million slice
rated AAA that pays a rate of 143 basis points more than the
London interbank offered rate, said the people, who declined to
be identified because the terms are private. Libor is the rate
at which banks say they can borrow in dollars from each other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the second CLO PineBridge has issued this year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Morgan Stanley arranged
a $412.5 million fund for the firm in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been $32 billion of CLOs backed by widely
syndicated loans raised in the U.S. this year, an increase from
$11.7 billion in all of 2011, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s investment
bank cut employee compensation 9.4 percent in the first nine
months of the year to $6.98 billion as the division generated
7.1 percent less revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expense was enough to give each of the division&#8217;s
25,884 employees $269,703, according to figures posted today on
the New York-based company&#8217;s website. For the same period last
year, the unit set aside $7.71 billion to pay traders,
dealmakers and other personnel, or $289,611 for each of the
26,615 people on staff as of Sept. 30, 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s biggest banks are cutting costs as concerns
that the global economy will slow limit revenue growth and new
capital rules depress returns. Mike Cavanagh and Daniel Pinto
were placed in charge of the investment bank in July, along with
the firm&#8217;s corporate bank and treasury and securities-services
units, replacing Jes Staley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank set aside $2.07 billion in the third quarter to
pay investment-bank employees, or 33 percent of that division&#8217;s
revenue. JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bank had 669 fewer people than at
the end of the second quarter, according to today&#8217;s disclosure.
The staff companywide contracted 1 percent to 259,547. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay costs for the first nine months of the year were 34
percent of revenue at the investment bank, down from 35 percent
in the same period a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount set aside for compensation includes salaries,
bonuses, benefits and the cost of deferred pay from previous
years. Figures for average pay don&#8217;t represent what any employee
actually receives and are calculated by dividing the total
compensation expense by the number of employees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank, sold $2.85 billion of three-year bonds in two parts,
including fixed-rate notes with its record-low coupon for a
benchmark offering, typically at least $500 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lender issued $2.25 billion of fixed-rate securities
due October 2015, with an unprecedented low rate of 1.1 percent
for three-year debt, that yield 77 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries and $600 million of three-year,
floating-rate securities to yield 66 basis points more than the
three-month London interbank offered rate, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coupon undercuts the 1.65 percent interest rate for
three-year, fixed-rate debt the bank obtained issuing $550
million of senior unsecured notes at a spread of 100 basis
points more than Treasuries in September 2010, Bloomberg data
show. Those securities traded at 101.3 cents on the dollar to
yield 0.33 percent Oct. 11, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new notes may be rated A2 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service,
considered subject to low credit risk, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has $194.9 billion of bonds outstanding with an
average maturity of 5.8 years, Bloomberg data show. Average
yields of 2.22 percent on the lender&#8217;s bonds compare with 3.84
percent at the end of last year, and with borrowing costs for
banks of 2.61 percent, down from 4.8 percent at year-end, Bank
of America Merrill Lynch index data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index may climb to a record 1,575 next year, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s David Kostin predicts, joining four other Wall Street firms in forecasting the benchmark gauge will exceed its 2007 peak. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The strategist&#8217; projection implies a 10 percent gain in the SP 500 from the Oct. 12 close of 1,428.59. The advance would take the index above its all-time high of 1,565.15 reached on Oct. 9, 2007. Kostin, chief U.S. equity strategist at New York- based Goldman Sachs, reiterated his estimate for SP 500 earnings to reach $107 a share next year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;SP 500 faces near-term political risk in the form of the &#8216;fiscal cliff&#8217; but has long-term policy support from QE3,&#8221; Kostin wrote in a note dated Oct. 12, referring to automatic deficit cuts that could go into effect starting in January and a third round of bond purchases from the Federal Reserve to stimulate economic growth. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wall Street strategists so far are unanimous in predicting the SP 500 will reach a record next year, according to the five firms that have made predictions out of 15 tracked by Bloomberg. Kostin&#8217;s estimate was shared by Bank of Montreal&#8217;s Brian Belski while lower than predictions of 1,600 by Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s Savita Subramanian, 1,615 by Tobias Levkovich at Citigroup Inc. and 1,585 by Oppenheimer  Co.&#8217;s John Stoltzfus. Kostin&#8217;s profit forecast is higher than the average estimate of $106.27 from the strategists tracked by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Unprecedented Stimulus &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 has rallied 14 percent this year, poised for its biggest annual gain since 2009, amid better-than-expected earnings and unprecedented stimulus from the Fed to boost the economy. The American equity benchmark needs to increase 9.6 percent from last week&#8217;s close to reach its all-time high. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The index may slump 13 percent to end this year at 1,250 as a potential government failure to reach an agreement on deficit cuts will spur a contraction in the SP 500&#8217;s multiples, according to Kostin. About $607 billion of automatic spending reductions and tax increases will be triggered unless a government comprised is reached this year. Goldman Sachs sees a one-in-three chance that Congress will reach a resolution by December. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 is trading at 14.5 times earnings, compared with an average income multiple of 16.4 over the last five decades, based on data tracked by Bloomberg. The index&#8217;s P/E ratio dropped to 12 in October 2011 after SP stripped the U.S. of its AAA sovereign credit rating on concern spending cuts agreed on by lawmakers to raise the nation&#8217;s borrowing limit won&#8217;t be enough to reduce record deficits. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Lu Wang in New York at  lwang8@bloomberg.net. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Lynn Thomasson at  lthomasson@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s Internet music
service will roll out starting tomorrow on Xbox and next week on
computers with Windows 8, as the company looks to compete
against Pandora Media Inc. (P) and Spotify Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xbox Music will offer free, unlimited advertising-supported
streaming of music on computers and tablets. For those seeking
access on the Xbox gaming console and mobile phones, the service
costs $9.99 a month, said Scott Porter, principal program
manager for the product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers who prefer to buy music, rather than just playing
it online, can also purchase albums and tracks. By offering
music streaming and downloads, the world&#8217;s largest software
maker is betting it can attract users from Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iTunes
and Amazon.com Inc.&#8217;s music store, as well as listeners of
streaming services such as Pandora, Spotify, Rdio Inc. and
Rhapsody International Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This gives Microsoft a strong music story which they&#8217;ve
lacked for years and extends the Xbox brand to media and
entertainment,&#8221; said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at market
research firm Gartner Inc. &#8220;A free streaming service with ads
every 15 or 20 minutes is pretty compelling. This is will put a
lot of pressure on the Spotify&#8217;s, the Rdio&#8217;s and Pandora&#8217;s.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application will also be available on new handsets with
Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Phone 8 software, coming in November. Mobile
apps for Apple&#8217;s iOS and Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Android are planned for
next year, Porter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft had already added
television and sports content to its Xbox Live service in a bid
to push into the consumer entertainment market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Single Platform &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xbox Music features touch controls and the tile design of
Windows 8. It will also be the default music service on the
operating system. Customers who want to use the streaming
service without ads on PCs and tablets will also have to pay
$9.99 a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a customer creates a playlist or downloads music on
one device such as a PC, the account is automatically updated if
they access it using a phone, tablet or Xbox because the data is
stored in the cloud. That&#8217;s an advance over Xbox Music&#8217;s
predecessor the Zune music service, Porter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially Xbox Music will lack some of the social features
seen in a service like Spotify, which tells users what music
their friends are listening to. While those will come next year,
Porter said, Microsoft is also mulling how to make those
features useful without &#8220;spamming&#8221; your friends with constant
notifications about a user&#8217;s listening choices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The service will have a worldwide catalog of 30 million
tracks, and in the U.S. there will be 18 million tracks 
available. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaders from the world&#8217;s biggest
emerging markets are moving closer toward establishing a
development bank of their own, according to Goldman Sachs Asset
Management Chairman Jim O&#8217;Neill.
     The so-called BRICS nations of Brazil, Russia, India,
China and South Africa have spent the year considering an
Indian proposal for a multilateral bank that would be
exclusively funded by those nations and finance projects in
them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Chinese have been &#8220;scratching their head&#8221;
about whether to support it, they may decide to if rich nations
continue to prove slow in backing a shift in voting power
toward emerging economies at the International Monetary Fund,
O&#8217;Neill told Tom Keene at the Bloomberg Link FX Summit in London
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Chinese could jump ship,&#8221; said O&#8217;Neill, who devised
the BRIC term a decade ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. has so far failed to ratify a 2010 agreement that
would give more strength to emerging markets at the IMF and make
China the third most powerful member. Negotiations over a 2014
shift in voting rights are already subject to disagreement over
how to calculate the reshuffle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Neill said China is shifting to a better &#8220;quality&#8221; of
growth from a previous focus on &#8220;quantity,&#8221; and its economy
will now expand between 6 percent and 8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;China are telling us they&#8217;re happy to have less growth
going forward,&#8221; said O&#8217;Neill, who added he expected more reform
to the nation&#8217;s economy and financial system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Growth Slowdown &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China will report this week that economic growth slowed to
7.4 percent in the third quarter, according to the median
estimate of a Bloomberg News survey of economists. That would be
the weakest annual pace in three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning to the euro area, O&#8217;Neill said equities in the
region remain &#8220;very, very&#8221; cheap. He argued that European
Central Bank President Mario Draghi sidelined the Bundesbank by
persuading German Chancellor Angela Merkel to back the bond-
buying program opposed by the country&#8217;s central bank chief, Jens Weidmann. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That &#8220;reduced the Bundesbank to a protest group,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill
said. &#8220;Nobody has ignored the Bundesbank like that since the
Berlin Wall fell.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Neill said he still expects the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
Index to end the year at about 1500 and is confident lawmakers
will strike a deal to avert the so-called fiscal cliff of $607
billion in federal spending cuts and tax increases scheduled to
take effect in January unless the U.S. Congress acts. The index
was at 1454.55 yesterday in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Neill, a former chief currency economist at Goldman
Sachs, said he sees the Australian dollar falling below $1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think the Aussie&#8217;s days above parity are numbered,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I&#8217;d be in favor of the euro over the Aussie.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Australian currency was 0.2 percent higher yesterday at
$1.0269 as of 5:52 p.m. London time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the biggest computer-services company, fell as much as
3.8 percent in extended trading after reporting third-quarter
revenue that fell short of estimates as clients delayed orders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares dropped 3.5 percent to $203.72 at 6:48 p.m. in
New York after trading as low as $203. The stock, which rose 1
percent to $211 at the close, has gained 15 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue dropped 5.4 percent to $24.7 billion, Armonk, New
York-based IBM said in a statement after the markets closed.
That missed the $25.4 billion average analyst estimate,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Profit excluding some
items rose 5 percent to $4.2 billion, or $3.62 a share. Analysts
on average predicted $3.61. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM cited an economic slowdown, especially in North
America, that caused software deals to be pushed back and kept
customers from signing up for business technology services
packages. Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty, in her first
year on the job, is working to combat weak economic growth by
expanding in emerging markets and shifting to higher-profit
software and services, like data analysis and cloud computing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The actual macro environment must be weaker than we
thought,&#8221; said Josh Olson, an analyst with Edward Jones  Co.
in Des Peres, Missouri. With biggest competitor Hewlett-Packard
Co. (HPQ) restructuring, &#8220;you&#8217;d think there would be opportunity
there for some gains. The revenue was disappointing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Software Slowdown &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income was little changed at $3.82 billion, or $3.33 a
share. The quarter was especially weak in North America in the
final month of the quarter, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on a call with investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was really a falloff that we saw in our GBS business,
number one, and in our software business, number two,&#8221;
Loughridge said, referring to Global Business Services. He
attributed the software slowdown to a handful of deals that
didn&#8217;t take place. &#8220;We thought we had those through the end of
the quarter,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM said sales were hurt by the divestiture of the
company&#8217;s point-of-sale business to Toshiba Tec Corp. (6588), the
Japanese maker of scanners and bar-code machines, during the
quarter. The unit generated $1.15 billion in revenue last year.
IBM also was ordered to pay an extra $160 million in retirement-
related expenses in a ruling by the High Court in London,
according to an Oct. 12 regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Currency Impact &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. dollar was 13 percent stronger than the euro on
average during the third quarter than a year earlier, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. That reduced the value of sales
from Europe, the Middle East and Africa, which were down 9
percent to $7.2 billion. Currency fluctuations hurt total sales
by $1 billion, IBM said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is betting on four areas to add $20 billion in
incremental revenue by 2015 as it shifts away from less-
profitable hardware. The areas include cloud computing, for
businesses to store data remotely on IBM servers; analytics
software, for businesses to make decisions based on data
analysis; &#8220;smarter planet,&#8221; for monitoring and improving
infrastructure like traffic and water systems; and emerging
markets, where the company plans to generate 30 percent of its
revenue by 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in its shrinking hardware business, IBM is designing
solutions for new corporate needs. The company updated its
PureSystems storage and networking technology with products that
focus on business analytics. A new zEnterprise mainframe
computer works better with cloud software and storage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world&#8217;s largest soft-drink maker, reported a 3.9 percent increase in third- quarter profit as sales volumes in Europe improved. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Net income rose to $2.31 billion, or 50 cents a share, from $2.22 billion, or about 48 cents, a year earlier, Atlanta-based Coca-Cola said today in a statement. Revenue advanced less than 1 percent to $12.3 billion, trailing the $12.4 billion average of analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent has been adjusting prices and introducing new products to cope with weaker demand in European nations facing a persistent debt crisis and slowing growth in China and Brazil. Sales volumes in Europe increased 1 percent, compared with a 4 percent drop in the second quarter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;You had growth in all regions which is always good to see,&#8221; Jack Russo, an analyst with Edward Jones  Co. in St. Louis, said today in a telephone interview. &#8220;Overall, a good start to the earnings season.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola fell 0.6 percent to $37.90 at the close in New York. The shares have gained 8.3 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Excluding some items, profit was 51 cents a share, matching the average of 14 analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Global volume sales, a key measure of demand, rose 4 percent, helped by a 2 percent boost in North America. Consumer sentiment and the debt crisis in Europe may have reached bottom, Kent said today in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth- biggest U.S. bank by assets, reported profit that beat analysts&#8217; estimates on higher underwriting fees and a jump in the value of the firm&#8217;s own investments. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Third-quarter net income of $1.51 billion, or $2.85 per share, compared with a loss of $393 million, or 84 cents, a year earlier, the New York-based bank said today in a statement. The average estimate of 25 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was $2.28 a share. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, led by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 58, benefited from a rise in asset values that boosted the firm&#8217;s holdings of stock and debt, reversing a loss from a year earlier. Revenue from trading fixed-income, currency and commodities fell short of gains posted by JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Citigroup Inc. (C) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The main driver of the earnings beat was basically larger mark-to-market type gains in their investing and lending division,&#8221; said Richard Staite, an analyst at Atlantic Equities LLP in London who rates Goldman Sachs stock &#8220;neutral.&#8221; Trading revenue matched estimates, and &#8220;given that JPMorgan and Citigroup performed better than expected, that could be a bit disappointing,&#8221; Staite said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs raised the quarterly dividend to 50 cents from 46 cents, the second increase this year. The shares, which climbed 3.6 percent yesterday, dropped 1 percent to $123.22 in New York trading at 4:15 p.m. Even after gaining 38 percent this year, the stock is below the firm&#8217;s theoretical liquidation value as investors wait to see whether returns will remain depressed by slow economic growth and regulatory constraints. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cuba&#8217;s government said it will no longer require residents to apply for exit visas to travel abroad, easing restrictions that have prevented most citizens from leaving the communist island for decades. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Starting Jan. 14, Cubans will no longer need to obtain invitations from a resident of a foreign country in order to travel and can stay abroad for up to 24 months, according to a statement published today in the Official Gazette. Currently, Cubans can lose residency and other rights including free health care after staying 11 months abroad. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think the requests to leave Cuba are going to be extraordinarily large,&#8221; said Dr. Jose Azel, a researcher at the Institute for Cuban and Cuban-American Studies at the University of Miami, in a phone interview. &#8220;For over half a century Cubans have not been able to travel freely abroad, so in that sense it is a significant change.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The shift in migration policy comes as President Raul Castro opens up the economy in the biggest overhaul since the 1959 revolution led by his brother Fidel. For the first time in a half-century, Cubans can now buy and sell property while Castro has vowed to slash state payrolls amid a decline in the price of nickel and a slowdown in tourism -- the country&#8217;s two- biggest sources of foreign currency. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Exodus &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a bid to prevent an exodus of the nation&#8217;s best and brightest, certain professionals won&#8217;t benefit from the change in rules. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The government plans to restrict some travel &#8220;to defend itself from the interventionist and subversive plans of the U.S. government and its allies,&#8221; according to today&#8217;s statement. &#8220;Measures will remain to preserve the human capital created by the revolution.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yoani Sanchez, a dissident who frequently writes about her failed efforts to leave Cuba, questioned whether the new rules will apply to people who have clashed with the government. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I was denied the permit to travel on 20 occasions during five years,&#8221; she wrote on her Twitter account. &#8220;Will the opening be so open?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The eased travel restrictions will add to pressure on foreign countries&#8217; migration offices and probably require adjustments to the number of visas granted to Cubans, Azel said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The larger decisions are going to have to be made by the host countries,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They are unlikely to issue thousands and thousands of tourist visas, knowing that in all likelihood, the Cuban citizens are going to stay in those countries.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Dry Foot&#8217; Policy &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those who flee the island are allowed to stay in the U.S. through the so-called &#8220;wet foot, dry foot&#8221; policy, which has given refuge to Cubans who manage to cross the Florida Straits and step foot on U.S. soil. Cubans interdicted at sea by U.S. officials are returned to the island. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While welcoming the easing of travel restrictions, the U.S. still requires Cubans to have an entry visa to legally enter and is warning them &#8220;not to risk their lives by undertaking dangerous sea journeys,&#8221; said William Ostick, a U.S. State Department spokesman. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Like the Cuban people, we await further information on how the changes in travel rules are implemented,&#8221; Ostick said in an e-mailed statement today. &#8220;We are also looking at the possibility that changes to Cuba&#8217;s exit visa regulations may cause a change in migration patterns from Cuba.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Eric Sabo in Panama City at  esabo1@bloomberg.net; Adam Williams in San Jose, Costa Rica at  awilliams111@bloomberg.net. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Joshua Goodman at  jgoodman19@bloomberg.net. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will sell its first computer, a device called Surface RT, for as little as $499 as the software maker pushes into the tablet market dominated by Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPad. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first iteration of the device, powered by a chip with technology from ARM Holdings Plc (ARM), will be available as a 32- gigabyte model for $499, the company said in a statement. With a black cover, it will cost $599, and a 64-gigabyte version will be $699. The machine goes on sale Oct. 26, and Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft will take a limited number of early online orders starting at 12 p.m. New York time today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest software maker needed a device priced under $500 to lure customers away from the iPad and to compete with Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Google Inc. (GOOG), which are pushing prices lower in the tablet category, said Bob O&#8217;Donnell, an analyst at market-research firm IDC. The latest version of the iPad starts at $499 for a 16-gigabyte device that, like the Surface, uses a Wi-Fi short range wireless connection. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Everything is pulling tablet prices down to below $500, so anything over $500 -- that is a tablet that is going to look expensive,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The snap-on cover, which includes a full keyboard, is one of the key features that make the Surface different from other tablets. Customers can buy the cover for $119.99 in black, white, magenta, cyan and red, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;New Windows &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Surface will be sold in Microsoft&#8217;s retail stores, including 34 temporary locations set up for the holidays. They&#8217;re also available online in the U.S., U.K., China, Germany, France, Hong Kong, Australia and Canada. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The tablet has a 10.6-inch display and will run the new version of Microsoft&#8217;s operating system, which also goes on sale Oct. 26. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The software maker is stepping up its assault on the tablet market as consumers choose the devices over laptops, weakening personal-computer sales and curbing Windows revenue. In the third quarter, total global PC shipments fell 8.3 percent from a year earlier to 87.5 million, market-research firm Gartner Inc. said last week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since the iPad went on sale in April 2010, Apple has led the tablet market, which is predicted by DisplaySearch to reach $63.2 billion this year. Apple has 61 percent of the market, according to Gartner. Apple may introduce a smaller, less expensive version of the iPad at an event on Oct. 23, a person familiar with the matter said last week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple will probably price the iPad mini at $299 or $349, said Shaw Wu, an analyst at Sterne Agee  Leach Inc. An older version of the iPad sells for $399 in the U.S., according to the company&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Google&#8217;s Nexus 7 tablet and some versions of Amazon&#8217;s Kindle Fire with 7-inch screens cost $199. Amazon also sells a Fire with an 8.9-inch screen for $299. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Dina Bass in Seattle at  dbass2@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Tom Giles at  tgiles5@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Josh Birnbaum, the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) trader instrumental in the bank&#8217;s bet against the U.S subprime mortgage market in 2007, posted a 30 percent gain this year in his hedge fund, according to a person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tilden Park Capital Management LP, based in New York with $1.1 billion in assets, rose 6 percent in September, amid winning wagers on securities backed by the loans to borrowers with poor credit, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the fund is private. Steve Bruce, a spokesman for Tilden Park, declined to comment on the returns. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brevan Howard Management LLP, D.E. Shaw  Co. and Angelo Gordon  Co. are among a growing number of funds that have started pools of capital this year to invest in mortgage securities that lack U.S. government backing. They have been lured to the almost $1 trillion non-agency mortgage bond market in part by property prices that are stabilizing after the biggest real estate crash since the 1930s. The entrants have only marginally diminished the number of opportunities, Birnbaum, 40, said in a telephone interview last week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s billions of dollars of bonds trading a week and they are hotly debated by people who trade them,&#8221; said Birnbaum, who declined to comment on his fund&#8217;s returns. &#8220;That produces an opportunity to make money in this space because valuation opinions are vastly different.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth- biggest U.S. bank by assets, set aside almost $11 billion to pay employees in the first nine months of the year, up 10 percent from the same period in 2011 as revenue climbed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, stock awards and benefits, was 44 percent of the firm&#8217;s nine-month revenue, New York-based Goldman Sachs said today in a statement. That&#8217;s the same rate as a year earlier, when the firm set aside $10 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s biggest banks are under pressure to cut costs as concern that the global economy will slow revenue growth and new capital rules take effect. Goldman Sachs said in July that it plans to eliminate $500 million from annual expenses, mostly from compensation, on top of a $1.4 billion reduction earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S. bank by assets, said last week that it cut employee compensation at its investment bank by 9.4 percent in the first nine months of the year as the business generated 7.1 percent less revenue. It was enough to give each of the division&#8217;s 25,884 employees $269,703. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s cost was equivalent to $336,441 for each of its 32,600 workers as of Sept. 30. A year earlier the firm employed 34,200 people, who shared about $10 billion, or $292,836 each, for the nine-month period. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global economic slowdown is prompting companies to curtail technology spending and pushing consumers to favor mobile devices like Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPhone over personal computers, eroding profitability at Intel Corp. (INL) and trimming sales for International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Intel, the largest chipmaker, forecast fourth-quarter gross margins that missed analysts&#8217; estimates, while IBM, the biggest computer-services provider, reported third-quarter revenue that fell short of projections. Shares of both companies declined in late trading yesterday and German trading today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM customers, hurt by anemic demand in home markets, put off software purchases and computer-maintenance contracts. Budget-strapped consumers are shunning PCs to buy cheaper handheld devices such as the iPhone, while businesses are shying away from servers that run networks, sapping demand for Intel chips. The reports bode ill for Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the No. 1 software maker, which releases results tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not looking good out there,&#8221; said Alex Gauna, an analyst at JMP Securities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM fell 4.9 percent to $200.63 at the close in New York, the biggest decline since October 2009. Intel dropped 2.5 percent to $21.79. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s largest energy company by market value, agreed to buy Celtic Exploration Ltd. (CLT) for C$2.86 billion ($2.92 billion) in cash and stock, adding oil and gas production in Canada&#8217;s Montney and Duvernay shale. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Celtic&#8217;s holders will receive C$24.50 ($24.89) a share and half a share of a new company that will hold assets not included in the agreement, Calgary-based Celtic said today in a statement. The cash value per-share represents a 35 percent premium to Celtic&#8217;s closing price yesterday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The purchase is the largest by Exxon Mobil since its $35 billion takeover of XTO Energy in June 2010. It includes 545,000 net acres in the Montney shale and 104,000 acres in the Duvernay, fields where oil and natural gas are extracted by horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, so-called unconventional operations that were XTO&#8217;s specialty. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This acquisition will add significant liquids-rich resources to our existing North American unconventional portfolio,&#8221; Andrew Barry, president of Exxon Mobil Canada, said in a separate statement. &#8220;Our financial and technical strength will enable us to maximize resource value by leveraging the experience of Exxon Mobil subsidiary XTO Energy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Current production on the acreage is 72 million cubic feet of gas a day and 4,000 barrels a day of oil and natural gas liquids. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Acreage Value &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon rose 1.1 percent to $93.39 at the close in New York. Celtic rose 45 percent to C$26.29 in Toronto, the biggest gain in more than 10 years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon is paying about C$3,600 an acre for Celtic&#8217;s holdings, compared with C$2,800 an acre in Petroliam Nasional Bhd&#8217;s pending C$5.16 billion purchase of Progress Energy Resources Corp., Brook Papau, a Calgary-based energy-markets analyst for ITG Investment Research in Calgary, said today in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Celtic&#8217;s Duvernay production may be as much as half oil and other petroleum liquids by volume, prized because those sell at premiums to gas, Papau said. The area has been actively drilled, reducing the risk that the petroleum in place is lower than estimated, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon may also eventually export liquefied natural gas to Asia from the Montney shale, where production is about 80 percent gas, Papau said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;LNG Exports &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company is looking at potential LNG export projects in western Canada and the U.S., Thomas Walters, president of Exxon Mobil Gas  Power Marketing Co., said Sept. 19 in an interview at an LNG conference in Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon also may attempt to join export projects led by Apache Corp. (APA) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) that are planned in Kitimat, British Columbia, Papau said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The major oil companies are recognizing that Canada represents an enormous opportunity to build out their portfolios in unconventional&#8221; resources such as shale, Gianna Bern, founder of Brookshire Advisory and Research Inc., a Chicago- based risk-management adviser to energy producers, said in an interview today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Western Canadian shale acreage is held in large blocks by small companies, making it attractive for major oil companies that can create value by accelerating drilling and locking in major supply lines to market, Papau said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Unconventional Expertise &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson spent almost $40 billion during the past 28 months acquiring shale fields and the expertise to harvest them, including last month&#8217;s $2 billion agreement to buy drilling rights in North Dakota and Montana from Denbury Resources (DNR) Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the past four weeks, Exxon has agreed to purchase drilling rights in shale and other unconventional formations spanning 845,000 acres, an area more than four times the size of New York City. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Worldwide oil prices surged 20 percent since the end of 2010, enabling Exxon to expand its cash reserve by almost $10 billion to $17.8 billion at the end of the second quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Canada will assume C$240 million of debt in the transaction, Sadiq H. Lalani, chief financial officer of Celtic, said today in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;New Company &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to cash for each share owned, each Celtic shareholder will get half a share of the new company led by Lalani and David J. Wilson, Celtic&#8217;s CEO. The company will have daily production equivalent to 3,300 barrels of oil a day and will have assets in Alberta and British Columbia. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new company will own property for which Exxon and Celtic couldn&#8217;t agree on a value, Lalani said in an interview. &#8220;So it made more sense for us to keep that,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Net asset value of the new company is C$2.32 a share, Celtic said in its statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Celtic used no financial advisers, Lalani said. FirstEnergy Capital Corp. and RBC Capital Markets provided fairness opinions, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The deal has been unanimously approved by Celtic&#8217;s board and is subject to a C$90 million termination fee, paid by Celtic, if it isn&#8217;t completed under certain conditions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Jim Polson in New York at jpolson@bloomberg.net; Joe Carroll in Chicago at jcarroll8@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Susan Warren at susanwarren@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canadian stocks rose to their
highest level in a month as energy shares rallied after Exxon
Mobil Corp. agreed to acquire oil and gas producer Celtic
Exploration Ltd. and U.S. housing starts jumped to a four-year
high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celtic Exploration jumped 45 percent after agreeing to a
C$2.86 billion ($2.91 billion) sale to Exxon Mobil. Encana Corp. (ECA)
increased 2.4 percent. Ivanplats Ltd. rose 6.3 percent in its
first day of preliminary trading after raising C$300.8 million
in an initial public offering yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX) added 53.54
points, or 0.4 percent, to 12,461.24 in Toronto, its highest
close since Sept. 14. Energy companies contributed the most to
gains in the benchmark equity gauge as six of 10 industries
advanced on trading 16 percent higher than the 30-day average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a positive tone in oils because of the surprise
takeover of Celtic Exploration, (CLT)&#8221; said Bob Decker, a money
manager at Aurion Capital in Toronto. His firm manages about
C$5.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s put a bid on most of the EP companies with similar
assets and put a general positive tone on the sector,&#8221; Decker
said, referring to energy exploration and production companies
that also have interests in the Montney and Duvernay shale
fields in which Celtic operates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celtic surged 45 percent to C$26.29. Shareholders will
receive C$24.50 a share and half a share of a new company that
will hold assets not included in the agreement, Calgary-based
Celtic said in a statement. The deal will give Exxon Mobil, the
world&#8217;s largest energy company, significant new production in
the Alberta shale fields, where oil and gas are extracted by
horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shale Plays &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among Montney and Duvernay shale companies, Cequence Energy
Ltd. (CQE) added 12 percent to C$1.98, NuVista Energy Ltd. (NVA) gained 13
percent to C$5.14, Advantage Oil  Gas Ltd. (AAV) rose 1.6 percent to
C$3.88 and Trilogy Energy Corp. (TET) advanced 6.1 percent to C$27.69. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New-home construction in the U.S. surged to the highest
level in four years, raising hopes that the economy of the
world&#8217;s biggest oil-consuming country is improving. Crude for
November delivery rose three cents to settle at $92.12 a barrel
in New York, reversing earlier losses of as much as 0.6 percent
after the U.S. Energy Department said inventories rose more than
analysts expected last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encana added 2.4 percent to C$22.78 and Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)
increased 1.3 percent to C$33.60. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Harry Winston &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harry Winston Diamond Corp. (HW) rose 3.7 percent to C$13.83,
paring earlier gains of as much as 10 percent. The mining
company, which owns 40 percent of the Diavik diamond mine in the
Northwest Territories, is in talks with major European luxury
goods companies such as PPR SA and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis
Vuitton SA to sell its jewelry and watches business, according
to Challenges, a weekly French business magazine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ivanplats (IVP), a mining company founded by billionaire Robert Friedland, rose 6.3 percent to C$5.05, trading on an &#8220;if and
when issued basis&#8221; ahead of its official listing on the TSX.
The company yesterday sold 63.3 million shares at C$4.75. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirkland Lake Gold Inc. (KGI) slumped 4.9 percent to C$9.99 after
announcing it will sell C$60 million in convertible notes. The
company plans to use the cash to pay for production expansions
at its mine in Kirkland Lake, Ontario. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) and Spain&#8217;s
Repsol SA are among winning bidders at Colombia&#8217;s first
government auction of oil and natural gas blocks in two years as
the country seeks investment to boost reserves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South America&#8217;s third-largest oil supplier is also granting
licenses to state-controlled Ecopetrol SA, Gran Tierra Energy
Inc. and other producers after offering 115 blocks, according to
preliminary results on the National Hydrocarbons Agency&#8217;s
website. The blocks offered today include more than two dozen
areas holding oil and natural gas trapped in shale rock. The
final list of companies awarded blocks will be published next
month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombia, whose oil output has jumped 72 percent since
2007, is seeking to boost reserves to ensure that production
will keep rising after improved security drew record
international investment. The nation&#8217;s reserves of about 2.3
billion barrels are equivalent to almost seven years of output,
lagging those of smaller producers Ecuador and Argentina, U.S.
government data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Seven years is a relatively small amount for a country
that depends a lot on oil,&#8221; Juan David Pineros, an analyst at
the nation&#8217;s largest brokerage, Interbolsa SA, said yesterday in
a telephone interview from Medellin, Colombia. &#8220;It&#8217;s a big step
to ensure future reserves.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell outbid companies including Ecopetrol (ECOPETL) to garner an
exploratory block in the Caribbean off Colombia&#8217;s northern
coast. Ecopetrol submitted the top bid for areas including a
shale-rock block in an eastern province near the Venezuelan
border. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Future Potential&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hague-based Shell is targeting areas that have &#8220;future
potential&#8221; in Colombia, Kelly OpDeWeegh, a Houston-based U.S.
media relations officer for the company, said by e-mail. Dana
Coffield, chief executive of Gran Tierra, didn&#8217;t respond
immediately to an e-mail seeking comment. Officials at Ecopetrol
didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an
e-mail asking for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombia&#8217;s government is auctioning the blocks as it begins
peace talks today in Oslo with the nation&#8217;s largest guerrilla
group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, in a bid to
end an armed conflict in its fifth decade. Rising rebel sabotage
of oil pipelines this year prompted Ecopetrol, which funnels
revenue to government coffers, to cut its 2012 production target
to 780,000 barrels of oil a day from 800,000 barrels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blocks were awarded based on proposals for investment and
the government&#8217;s share of production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombia sought to award rights to blocks covering about
13.5 million hectares (33.4 million acres) across mountainous
central Colombia, its eastern plains and offshore in the
Caribbean, according to the Bogota-based National Hydrocarbons
Agency. Some blocks sparked competing offers while others,
including some unconventional blocks, had no bidders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shale Investments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The auction sought to draw $500 million of investment in
unconventional reserves, the government said in March.
Ecopetrol, Colombia&#8217;s largest oil company, already is seeking
partners to drill for the fuels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A surge in production of shale gas in the U.S. is leading
companies to search for new sources overseas, Pineros said.
Production and reserves of U.S. shale gas more than quadrupled
in 2010 from 2007, according to the website of the U.S. Energy
Information Administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombia expects to produce more than 1 million barrels a
day of crude at the end of December, Energy and Mines Minister
Federico Renjifo said last week. Output was 956,300 barrels a
day in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venezuela and Brazil are South America&#8217;s largest oil
producers. Ecuador and Argentina surpass Colombia in crude
reserves, with 6.5 billion barrels and 2.5 billion barrels,
respectively, according to figures from the U.S. Energy
Information Administration. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serbia will try to avoid a
reintroduction of visas for its nationals traveling to the
European Union after the number of false asylum-seekers rose in
some EU member states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Ivica Dacic ordered ministries to take
action because &#8220;protecting visa liberalization is one of the
top priorities of the Serbian government,&#8221; his press office
said in an e-mailed statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prime minister convened an emergency session of the
committee supervising visa-free travel, which EU member states
in the so-called Schengen area, a part of the 27-nation EU that
allows passport-free travel, granted Serbia in December 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting followed media reports that some countries led
by Germany want to restore visas for Serbs because of a surge in
asylum-seekers. Dacic heads a government dominated by former
nationalists and Socialists of ex-Serbian strongman Slobodan
Milosevic, whose rule in the 1990s was marked by wars,
isolation, travel bans and economic mismanagement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The committee analyzed the situation and developed a plan
to clamp down on the increase in false asylum-seekers and plans
to name a team to visit countries most affected by such claims,
the office said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vincent Degert, head of the EU delegation to Serbia, said
Oct. 10 that asylum applications rose by 200 percent in
Switzerland, more than 20 percent in Sweden and Germany, and
that almost 99 percent of the asylum seekers were sent back.
&#8220;What Serbia wants and what the EU wants is to preserve the
visa liberalization,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;EU Candidate &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serbia became a candidate for EU membership in March. The
country will get a date for the start of entry talks once the
government improves ties with Kosovo, Serbia&#8217;s former province,
which unilaterally declared independence in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popular support in Serbia for EU membership declined in the
three months to September, according to a survey presented by
the Belgrade Centre for Security Policies today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey, conducted Sept. 18-25, showed overall backing
for the EU path dropped two percentage points to 47 percent
while opposition to joining the EU rose 10 percentage points to
35 percent, Tanjug news agency reported, citing Sonja
Stojanovic, the center&#8217;s director. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) may have sold out of
the initial run of the $499 version of its Surface tablet,
according to ordering information on the company&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The device, a 32-gigabyte machine, was offered yesterday
for a limited number of early orders ahead of the Oct. 26
release. Microsoft&#8217;s orders site has gone from guaranteeing the
$499 model -- the cheapest -- for delivery by Oct. 26 to
requesting that customers &#8220;order now for shipment within three
weeks,&#8221; indicating the first batch has sold out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $599 model, which includes a black touch cover, and the
$699 64-gigabyte Surface, also with a black cover, are still
available for delivery by the 26th. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO) and Sanofi (SAN) set up a
joint venture to sell health drinks at French pharmacies, a
pilot project to test demand for beverages with beauty claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beverages, called Beautific and sold under the brand
name Oenobiol, will be available within months, the two
companies said in separate statements. Coca-Cola, the world&#8217;s
largest soft-drink maker, will handle formulation and Sanofi
will oversee distribution, according to the French drugmaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanofi is looking to diversify to reduce its reliance on
prescription drugs while Coca-Cola faces pressure to offer
healthier beverages amid rising obesity rates. The first four
drinks will help with hair, weight loss, sun exposure and
general vitality, according to a Sanofi presentation obtained by
Bloomberg. The product, designed to appeal to active urban women
aged 25 to 45, will cost between 2 euros ($2.60) and 3 euros a
bottle, the document shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The blockbuster model is broken, and drugmakers have been
turning to consumer health-care,&#8221; Pierre Corby, an analyst at
Aurel BGC in Paris, said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanofi Chief Executive Officer Chris Viehbacher has been
reshaping the French company since he took over almost four
years ago. The 52-year-old CEO has been expanding in animal
health as well as consumer products as its top medicines,
including the blood-thinner Plavix, face generic competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola and Sanofi will own 50 percent of the venture,
Sanofi said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gold Bond Powder &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanofi&#8217;s consumer health-care business has been growing
through purchases, such as the 2010 acquisition of Chattem Inc.,
the U.S. maker of Gold Bond medicated powder. The company
acquired Laboratoire Oenobiol, a French maker of nutritional
beauty supplements, three years ago. Sales of consumer goods,
which Sanofi touts as one of its growth platforms, rose 23
percent to 2.7 billion euros ($3.54 billion) last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Viehbacher has been cutting internal
research, ending the least promising projects and lowering
headcount. In France, a new plan to eliminate about 900 jobs by
2015 has drawn criticism from politicians and unions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s announcement is an example of how Sanofi&#8217;s identity
is changing under Viehbacher, unions said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They presented this project to our sales forces as if it
were the height of innovation,&#8221; Thierry Bodin, a union
representative, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;We are
concerned about trying to get new medicines to patients, and
Sanofi&#8217;s management is only worried about making money, in this
case with beauty products.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s (PFE) Centrum Silver multivitamin can reduce a man&#8217;s risk of cancer when taken daily, a study said, countering previous findings that show such supplements have no beneficial effect and may be harmful. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers tracked about 14,641 men, who were at least 50 years old, from 1997 to 2011, with some taking a multivitamin and others taking a placebo. Participants on the nutritional supplement had an 8 percent reduction in cancer occurrences, according to the study, published today in the Journal of the American Medical Association. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The results contradict earlier research that suggests some vitamins and supplements may be harmful. Last year, a paper linked the use of multivitamins with a 2.4 percent increased risk of death among older women. A different study also connected daily use of vitamin E with increased risk of prostate cancer in healthy men. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The data has been mixed at times around multivitamins,&#8221; said Chris Kocun, vice president of global medical affairs for New York-based Pfizer&#8217;s consumer health-care unit. &#8220;This study really shows you&#8217;re going to get a long-term health benefit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In July, Pfizer agreed to change the labels on its vitamin containers, and remove claims of promoting breast and colon health, after the Washington-based consumer advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest complained it would mislead consumers into thinking the pills prevented cancer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TiVo Inc. (TIVO) said it may be entitled to
billions of dollars in damages should it win its patent-
infringement lawsuit against Google Inc.&#8217;s Motorola Mobility
unit over digital-video recording technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Motorola&#8217;s massive production of infringing DVRs dwarfs
the numbers of accused products at issue in TiVo&#8217;s previous
cases,&#8221; TiVo said in a filing Oct. 15 in federal court in
Marshall, Texas. &#8220;TiVo&#8217;s damages claim is likely to run into
the billions of dollars.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TiVo disclosed the figure in a request to consolidate the
case against Motorola Mobility with one involving Cisco Systems
Inc. (CSCO) to address pre-trial issues, saying it would speed the
process and conserve resources. The companies make set-top boxes
for Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC), which is a defendant in both cases.
TiVo said it also will seek an order to force Motorola Mobility
to stop selling products that infringe TiVo patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an Oct. 9 filing, Motorola Mobility said TiVo waited too
long to make its request, since the judge had already split the
case to have the claims against Motorola Mobility and Cisco
handled separately. The Motorola Mobility case is further along
than the Cisco one, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility, based in Libertyville, Illinois, said it
also has its own patent-infringement claims against TiVo that
are unrelated to Cisco. The company said it would seek to have
TiVo give up patent-licensing revenue it claims was &#8220;wrongfully
derived from Motorola&#8217;s inventions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alviso, California-based TiVo is basing its damages
estimate in part on previous patent settlements including the
$600 million it received from Dish Network Corp., more than $215
million from ATT Inc. and more than $250 million from Verizon
Communications Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mountain View, California-based Google, which bought
Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion in May, is seeking to sell
the unit that supplies cable television providers with set-top
boxes and other equipment. The TiVo litigation could make that
difficult, said Kevin Stadtler, principal of Stadtler Capital
Management LLC in Fort Worth, Texas, who owns TiVo shares and is
projecting they will rise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is highly improbable Google can sell the set-top box
division without settling with TiVo considering the threat of an
injunction and a potential claim like this,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Motorola Mobility Inc. v. TiVo Inc., 11cv53;
and TiVo Inc. v. Cisco Systems Inc., 12cv311, both U.S. District
Court for the Eastern District in Texas (Marshall). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yves Saint Laurent Seeks to Dismiss Claims Against Louboutin &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yves Saint Laurent SAS, following an appeals court ruling
in September that it has the legal right to sell monochromatic
women&#8217;s shoes with red soles, asked a federal judge to dismiss
counterclaims it filed against Christian Louboutin Sarl. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yves Saint Laurent seeks to end the lawsuit Louboutin
brought to prevent Saint Laurent from selling red-soled shoes,
according to a filing yesterday in Manhattan. Saint Laurent
tried to persuade the federal courts to reject Louboutin&#8217;s
trademark for red soles. The U.S. Court of Appeals in New York,
in a mixed decision, said Louboutin had a limited right to the
trademark but couldn&#8217;t stop Saint Laurent from selling
monochromatic red shoes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Now that the Second Circuit has definitively rejected
Louboutin&#8217;s claims against YSL, YSL prefers to refocus its
energies on its business and creative designs, and has
determined that these claims are no longer worth pursuing,&#8221;
Yves Saint Laurent said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero in August 2011 rejected
a bid by Louboutin for an injunction to stop Saint Laurent from
selling the shoes. Louboutin appealed and Marrero said he would
defer deciding whether to cancel Louboutin&#8217;s trademark for the
red sole until after the appeals court ruled. The appeals court
said Louboutin&#8217;s trademark didn&#8217;t extend to all-red shoes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not unexpected,&#8221; Harley Lewin, a lawyer with
McCarter  English LLP who represented Louboutin, said in a
phone interview. &#8220;We&#8217;re talking to the client about whether
there are any further steps to take. This is all that was left.
The essential dispute was resolved.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saint Laurent seeks to dismiss six counterclaims. Four were
over trademark rights, and Saint Laurent said in its filing that
the district court no longer has jurisdiction over this issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two other claims were for tortious interference and
unfair competition. Saint Laurent said Louboutin called certain
retailers and told them to stop selling Saint Laurent&#8217;s red
shoes because it owned the trademark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the trademark counterclaims, Bernstein said that
because Louboutin&#8217;s claims against Saint Laurent were dismissed,
the only place to pursue cancellation of the trademark would be
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. He said Saint Laurent
would not pursue that action unless &#8220;Louboutin were to file a
new lawsuit against us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louboutin, a Paris-based fashion company, claimed in its
lawsuit filed in April 2011 that Yves Saint Laurent&#8217;s red-soled
footwear &#8220;threaten to mislead the public.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yves Saint Laurent is a unit of Paris-based PPR (PP), which owns
other luxury brands including Gucci &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Christian Louboutin SA v. Yves Saint Laurent
America, 11-2381, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;GM Didn&#8217;t Infringe Rights to Einstein Persona, Judge Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of images of the late Albert Einstein, &#8220;even in
tasteless ads,&#8221; can&#8217;t be barred by invoking copyright law, a
federal judge in Los Angeles said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge A. Howard Matz ruled in a case brought
by Hebrew University of Jerusalem against General Motors Co. The
school, which inherited the rights to all of the physicist&#8217;s
papers, copyrights, royalties, publication rights and literary
property, objected to GM&#8217;s use of an image of Einstein in an
advertisement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to court papers, that ad, which ran in one issue
of &#8220;People&#8221; magazine, was used to promote GM&#8217;s 2010 Terrain
vehicle. The university said the ad, which featured Einstein&#8217;s
face over the body of &#8220;a shirtless, muscle-bound underwear
model&#8221; and the text &#8220;ideas are sexy too&#8221; infringed its IP
rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school also claimed that such a use of Einstein&#8217;s image
denigrated and caused injury to its &#8220;carefully guarded rights&#8221;
to the image of the famous scientist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case was filed in California rather than New Jersey,
where Einstein died in April 1955. A New Jersey court said that
a term of life plus 50 years would be appropriate. In
California, that right extends for 70 years after the person&#8217;s
death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The university had argued that California law prevails and
that, in any case, the term should be 70 years under federal
copyright law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matz noted that nothing in Einstein&#8217;s will specifically
mentioned any right of publicity and that during his lifetime,
he never claimed or received compensation for the use of his
personal image. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matz said it &#8220;assumes without deciding&#8221; that the school
had succeeded in proving that Einstein had intended to transfer
his publicity rights along with the rest of his intellectual
property. California&#8217;s 70-year term for publicity rights doesn&#8217;t
apply to Einstein because the physicist died in Princeton, New
Jersey, and California&#8217;s rights extend only to its residents, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A maximum 50-year postmortem duration would be &#8220;long
enough for a deceased celebrity&#8217;s heirs to take advantage of and
reap the benefit,&#8221; according to the court. The court noted that
at the time the university acquired Einstein&#8217;s rights, the term
of copyright law was only 50 years postmortem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matz decided that 2005 was the last year in which the
university could sue to enforce any right of publicity related
to Einstein. Because the case wasn&#8217;t filed until 2012, the
school isn&#8217;t entitled to pursue it further, Matz said, saying
there would be no trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM has until Oct. 22 to file a proposed judgment in accord
with the court&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Hebrew University of Jerusalem v. General
Motors LLC, 10-cv-03790, U.S. District Court, Central District
of California (Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s Infringement Filter Targets &#8216;45&#8217; on Websites &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s automated filter that searches the
Internet for infringements of its copyrights, the magic number
apparently is &#8220;45,&#8221; the TorrentFreak website reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based software company sent
requests to Google Inc. (GOOG) to take down web pages through which
unauthorized copies of the company&#8217;s Widows 9 program were
allegedly being distributed, according to TorrentFreak, the
anti-copyright news source. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among those targeted in the takedown request were the BBC,
the Washington Post, Wikipedia, CNN, the Rotten Tomatoes movie-
ranking site, and AMC Theatres, TorrentFreak reported, noting
that Google didn&#8217;t censor some of these sites such as the BBC
and Wikipedia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The common element on about half the sites was that they
made reference to the number 45 in some way while they had
nothing to do with the Microsoft product, TorrentFreak reported,
without explaining the significance of that particular number. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;UNC Copyright Committee to Clarify School&#8217;s Right to Content &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of North Carolina&#8217;s copyright committee will
develop guidelines on content use to help address concerns among
faculty members about rights to work they create, the school&#8217;s
the Daily Tar Heel newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a condition of employment at the school, the university
has the right to use materials created by the faculty, including
&#8220;pedagogical, scholarly, literary or aesthetic works resulting
from nondirected effort,&#8221; according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many faculty members don&#8217;t understand that when they create
course material, it can be used by the school even after they
moved to a job elsewhere, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aim of the guidelines is to reduce faculty backlash against
reuse of the content they create, committee member Jean DeSaix
told the Daily Tar Heel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Washington Resident Receives Copyright Infringement Sentence &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Everett, Washington, man received a 40-month prison
sentence in a criminal copyright-infringement case, according to
Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sang Jim Kim, who in July entered a guilty plea to two
counts of infringement, must also forfeit $409,779. When he
finishes his prison term, he will have two years of supervised
release, according to an Oct. 12 court filing in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim was accused of copyright and distributing Korean-
language television programs, a number of pre-release action
films including &#8220;Tron: Legacy,&#8221; and &#8220;The Green Hornet,&#8221; and
computer games and software.  He made the available through the
www.82movie.com and www.007disk.com websites, the government
charged. An informant told the government that Kim had offered
to sell the 007disk.com websites, servers and related content
for $90,000, and that he claimed he would load more than 50,000
titles onto the site before selling it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Richard A. Jones characterized Kim as a
&#8220;one man wrecking ball&#8221; against the content industries, the
government said in an Oct. 12 statement. The government said
that when Kim was trying to sell his websites, he acknowledged
receiving infringement takedown notices, and said that he would
comply for a while and then put the infringing content back up
on his site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. A. v. Kim, 2:11-cv-00413-RAJ, U.S.
District Court, Western District of Washington (Seattle). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two Ex-Executives Questioned About AU Optronics Trade Secrets &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AU Optronics Corp. (2409), the Taiwan-based maker of flat-panel
display systems, was allegedly hit by trade-secret theft after
two executives left to join a competitor, the Times of India
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology related to a display technology used in
mobile devices and on television screens, according to the
newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taiwan&#8217;s Bureau of Investigation said the loss of the
allegedly purloined technology could undermine that country&#8217;s
competitive edge in the flat-panel industry, the Times of India
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two suspects, who were arrested and released, face
further questioning, according to the Times. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vinson  Elkins Hires IP Litigator Charles Ossola from Dickstein &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vinson  Elkins LLP hired Charles D. Ossola for its IP
practice, the Houston-based firm said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ossola, who joins from Washington&#8217;s Dickstein Shapiro LLP,
does patent and antitrust litigation and some copyright and
trademark work. He has represented clients whose technologies
include semiconductors, software, communication systems, MRI
technologies, pharmaceutical compositions, dermatology products,
medical devices, flexographic printing plates and processes,
dental implants, virtual private networks, and mechanical
systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to federal trial and appellate courts, Ossola
has also appeared before the U.S. International Trade
Commission, a Washington-based body with the power to exclude
imports that infringe U.S. patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ossola has an undergraduate degree from Williams College
and a law degree from Villanova University. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s largest-ever
Canadian acquisition is fueling speculation that domestic
companies with assets in Alberta&#8217;s shale-gas fields will become
takeover targets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Artek Exploration Ltd. (RTK), Cequence Energy Ltd. (CQE) and
NuVista Energy Ltd. (NVA) all surged yesterday after Exxon agreed to
pay $2.86 billion ($2.91 billion) for Celtic Exploration Ltd. (CLT)&#8217;s
leases in the Duvernay and Montney shale formations that span an
area twice the size of Los Angeles. Larger firms such as
Tourmaline Oil Corp. (TOU) and Paramount Resources Ltd. (POU) also climbed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal helps &#8220;externally verify&#8221; the Duvernay formation
as being &#8220;one of the best liquids-rich plays in Canada,&#8221; said
Randy Eresman, chief executive officer of  Encana Corp. (ECA),
Canada&#8217;s largest gas producer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Duvernay shale, which is soaked in natural gas as well
as petroleum liquids such as propane and ethane, which fetch
higher prices, may rival the mammoth Eagle Ford formation in
south Texas, Eresman said in an interview yesterday in his
Calgary office.  The Eagle Ford holds the equivalent of 25
billion barrels of crude, according to ITG Investment Research,
or enough to supply North American crude demand for 3 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The major oil companies are recognizing that Canada
represents an enormous opportunity to build out their portfolios
in unconventional&#8221; resources such as shale, Gianna Bern,
founder of Brookshire Advisory and Research Inc., a Chicago-
based risk-management adviser to energy producers, said in an
interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Large Blocks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In western Canada, drilling rights often are held in large
blocks by small companies, making it easier for major
international explorers to snap up significant holdings without
having to deal with thousands of individual landowners, as they
must in U.S. shale regions such as Ohio and Louisiana, said
Brook Papau, an analyst at ITG Investment in Calgary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The C$24.50 a share Exxon will pay amounts to a 35 percent
premium to Celtic&#8217;s Oct. 16 closing price. With 76 percent of
the reserves to be acquired comprised of gas, Exxon is wagering
that a cold North American winter and expanding use of gas in
place of coal at power plants will lift prices that touched a
decade-low in April, said Chris Kettenmann, an analyst at
Phoenix Partners Group LP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artek rose 23 percent to C$2.98 yesterday in Toronto. It
dropped to C$2.90 at market close today after announcing it sold
shares to banks and brokerages. Cequence climbed 12 percent
yesterday and was little changed today, while NuVista added 6.6
percent, bringing its two-day gains to 20 percent. All three are
based in Calgary. Tourmaline added 6.6 percent yesterday and was
little changed today while Paramount rose 8 percent over the
last two days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Face Challenges &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encana is seeking a partner to develop its Duvernay
acreage, one of a handful of joint venture packages the company
is marketing. He expects &#8220;at least one&#8221; deal to close by
year&#8217;s end, Eresman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This just shows the value embedded in the acreage, not
just this deal,&#8221; Eric Nuttall of Sprott Asset Management in
Toronto said in a telephone interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon is not alone in the shale fields that span parts of
Alberta and nearby provinces such as British Columbia and the
Yukon. Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), the world&#8217;s third-largest energy
company by market value after Exxon and PetroChina, has been
prospecting in the Duvernay shale since 2008. Chevron Corp. (CVX) also
has holdings there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duvernay explorers may face challenges in making the
prospect competitive with other North American fields. Duvernay
wells cost about C$12 million each to drill, Sveinung Svarte,
chief executive officer at Athabasca Oil Corp. (ATH), said in a
conference call with analysts Oct. 16. That&#8217;s about 36 percent
more than the $9 million Continental Resources Corp. said last
week it was spending on wells in a new discovery called the
South Central Oklahoma Oil Province, or SCOOP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Amassing Acreage &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cash-and-stock deal with Celtic is the Irving, Texas-
based company&#8217;s largest in Canada since the 1999 merger of Exxon
and Mobil Corp., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The economic and environmental advantages of natural gas
are clear - and markets around the world will increasingly seek
this cleaner burning source of energy to fuel progress and
prosperity,&#8221; Andrew Swiger, an Exxon senior vice president said
in a speech last month. &#8220;With North America&#8217;s abundant
supplies, natural gas will be a valued contributor to jobs and
energy security in Canada, the United States, and around the
world.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon probably is most keen on the Duvernay shale portion
of the Celtic transaction, said Nuttall, who oversees C$110
million at Sprott. The U.S. energy explorer is unlikely to
attempt to ship any of the gas produced in the Duvernay or
Montney areas to Canada&#8217;s west coast for export as liquefied
natural gas, or LNG, as it would require the construction of a
pipeline over mountains at a cost of $1 billion, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Too Dense &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon has been amassing shale acreage from south Texas to
the Yukon Territory after spending almost $35 billion in 2010
for XTO Energy&#8217;s gas fields and shale-drilling experts.
Benchmark gas futures traded in New York have risen 16 percent
this year, on track for the first annual gain in a half decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s clear prices are going higher,&#8221; Kettenmann said in
a telephone interview from New York yesterday. &#8220;Exxon is
following through on the bet they made with XTO.&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, which has been drilling for oil and gas in Canada
for more than seven decades, will acquire rights to 104,000 net
acres in the Duvernay and 545,000 acres in the Montney Shale.
Exxon has been deploying XTO engineers versed in horizontal
drilling and hydraulic fracturing to crack open shale formations
from Argentina to the Northwest Territories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon already held vast leases in other so-called
unconventional gas and oil prospects across western Canada,
including the Horn River Basin and the Cardium and Viking
fields. Unconventional prospects are geologic formations such as
shale that are too dense or non-porous to be tapped without
intensive drilling and fracturing techniques. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past four weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Rex Tillerson agreed to spend almost $5 billion in cash,
stock and asset swaps to expand Exxon&#8217;s North American shale
holdings, including the deal announced yesterday. On Sept. 20,
Exxon disclosed a $2 billion deal for Denbury Resources Inc. (DNR)&#8217;s
acreage in the Bakken shale of North Dakota and Montana. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world&#8217;s largest
soft drink maker, authorized a new plan to buy back 500 million
shares, valued at about $18.9 billion at yesterday&#8217;s closing
price, as it returns cash to investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new authorization doesn&#8217;t affect the plan to buy back
$2.5 billion to $3 billion in stock this year, the Atlanta-based
company said today in a statement. Coca-Cola said its current
repurchase program was authorized in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola has risen 48 percent since Chief Executive
Officer Muhtar Kent took over in July 2008, compared with an 9.9
percent gain for rival PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) Kent has pledged to reach
$200 billion in revenue for the company and its bottlers
globally by 2020, double the sales generated in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This company is in a good spot -- they don&#8217;t know what to
do with all their cash except to give it back to shareholders,&#8221;
Jack Russo, an analyst with Edward Jones  Co. in St. Louis,
said in a telephone interview. &#8220;They&#8217;ve been active share
repuchasers for a long time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola rose 0.3 percent to $37.84 at the close in New
York. The shares have gained 8.2 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directors also declared a quarterly dividend of 25.5 cents,
payable Dec. 17 to shareholders of record as of Nov. 30. The
company completed a 2-for-1 share split in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company had $18.1 billion in cash and equivalents as of
Sept. 28. Coca-Cola authorized the repurchase of as many as 300
million shares in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kent has adjusted prices and introduced new products to
cope with weaker demand in European nations facing a persistent
debt crisis and slowing growth in China and Brazil. Earlier this
week, the company reported a 3.9 percent increase in third-
quarter profit as sales volumes in Europe improved. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) reached a confidential
settlement with the widow of a Minnesota man who killed himself
after taking its anti-smoking drug Chantix, averting a trial set
to begin next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The widow of Mark Alan Whitely sued Pfizer after his death
in November 2007, alleging the company failed to sufficiently
warn that Chantix could increase the risk of suicide. The
Whitely lawsuit was the first of more than 2,500 Chantix cases
pending in federal court in Alabama set for trial, according to
court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We can confirm that we have settled this case,&#8221; Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement today.
&#8220;Terms are confidential.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement comes after Pfizer appealed U.S. District
Judge Inge Johnson&#8217;s order that its Chief Executive Officer Ian Read and two other executives testify in person at the Whitely
trial. Read and the other executives dropped the appeal
yesterday as moot, or unnecessary, because a settlement had been
reached, according to court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Whitely&#8217;s family is happy with the settlement,&#8221;
Ernest Cory, a Birmingham, Alabama-based lawyer representing the
plaintiffs, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Whitely case and other lawsuits have been combined in a
multidistrict litigation before Johnson in Alabama for pretrial
evidence-gathering and the first trials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Suicide Risk &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuits claim that Chantix causes depression and other
psychiatric disorders, some so severe that patients attempt or
commit suicide. The plaintiffs allege that Pfizer knew of a link
between Chantix and suicide and failed to sufficiently warn
patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has denied that Chantix was the cause of Whitely&#8217;s
suicide or that the company withheld information about the drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has provided warnings on the package insert of
reports of suicidal thoughts since 2006, Johnson said in court
papers in July. The notice was updated in 2007 and 2008,
&#8220;culminating in a &#8216;black box warning&#8217; being placed on the
package insert in July 2009,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers contend that Pfizer should have
provided such warnings earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cory said he didn&#8217;t believe the Whitely settlement was a
signal that Pfizer was pushing to settle the cases that have
been consolidated before Johnson in federal court in Florence,
Alabama. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Settlement Offers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accord &#8220;was a one-off as far as I can tell,&#8221; Cory
said. &#8220;I represent close to 400 families and I haven&#8217;t gotten
an offer to settle any of their claims so far.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cory said Johnson has set the next of four so-called
bellwether trials over the Chantix claims for January in
Alabama. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consolidated cases are In re Chantix (Varenicline)
Products Liability Litigation MDL 2092, 09-cv-2039 U.S. District
Court, Northern District of Alabama (Florence). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greg Smith, the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) salesman who publicly accused the firm of ripping off its clients, was denied a raise and a promotion in the weeks before he resigned in March, documents provided by Goldman show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Smith, 33, told one of his managers in a December 2011 meeting that he expected to earn more than $1 million a year, about double what he was making at the time as an executive director in London, according to a summary of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s investigation into Smith&#8217;s claims. He also said in the meeting that he wasn&#8217;t advancing up the corporate ladder fast enough and expected to win the promotion to managing director he had repeatedly stated as a goal in self-evaluations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His bosses were incredulous. New York-based Goldman Sachs, the fifth-largest U.S. bank, was about to book its second-lowest profit in a decade and that year had eliminated almost a tenth of its workforce -- 3,400 jobs. The equity-derivatives desk Smith worked for in London had been told that compensation would be down &#8220;significantly,&#8221; according to the firm&#8217;s summary. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Greg Smith off the charts unrealistic, thinks he shld [sic] trade at multiples,&#8221; one of Smith&#8217;s managers wrote in a January 2012 internal e-mail after informing him that his raise request and demand for promotion had been turned down. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Moral Fiber&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two months later, Smith made one of the most public exits in Wall Street history, announcing his resignation in a scathing op-ed in the New York Times entitled &#8220;Why I Am Leaving Goldman Sachs.&#8221; He called the environment at the firm &#8220;toxic and destructive,&#8221; said senior staff referred to clients by the derogatory term &#8220;muppets&#8221; and blamed Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and President Gary Cohn for &#8220;a decline in the firm&#8217;s moral fiber.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Smith has since documented his views and experiences in a 276-page book, &#8220;Why I Left Goldman Sachs.&#8221; Published by Grand Central, it&#8217;ll be available for purchase Oct. 22. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;American Way&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seeking better compensation is &#8220;the American way,&#8221; according to John Farrell, JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s former human- resources chief. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything wrong with trying to earn more and be promoted.&#8221; He added that any writing by former employees about their old workplaces should be taken &#8220;with a grain of salt.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The sudden and public nature of the departure caught Goldman Sachs off-guard. Smith was one of 13,000 vice presidents. Blankfein and Cohn had no idea who Smith was or why he decided to go public with his resignation, according to two people familiar with their thinking at the time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It makes me ill how callously people talk about ripping their clients off,&#8221; Smith wrote in the Times on March 14. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Soul Searching &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;That day, Blankfein, 58, set in motion a soul-searching mission that would become a months-long investigation into Smith&#8217;s allegations. According to two people close to the CEO, he indicated he and the board wanted to know why Goldman Sachs&#8217;s radar failed to detect Smith&#8217;s dissatisfaction. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among Wall Street firms, Goldman Sachs was dragged most publicly through Congressional inquiries over its role in the financial crisis, and it paid $550 million in a settlement with regulators. Now Goldman Sachs would have to defend its conduct again. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jake Siewert, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, says all of the firm&#8217;s attempts to talk to Smith after his resignation were rebuffed. Jimmy Franco, director of publicity at Grand Central, said in an e-mail that Smith would not be making statements at this time. The Financial Times reported details of the bank&#8217;s internal review last week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Forensic Specialists &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The firm hired forensic specialists to troll through e- mails and taped conversations, according to four people with direct knowledge of the probe. It also conducted interviews with 125 employees who had contact with Smith, going as far back as his summer internship in 2000. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The results of that investigation were shared with Goldman Sachs&#8217;s board and regulators including the Washington-based Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the U.K.&#8217;s Financial Services Authority, according to one of the people familiar with the probe. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A nine-page summary was provided to Bloomberg News. While it includes excerpts from Smith&#8217;s self-evaluations and quotes directly from internal e-mails, much is excluded. The summary does not, for example, show the context in which some of Smith&#8217;s remarks were made, leaving open the possibility of misinterpretation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, the documents paint a picture of Smith that is at odds with the image he fashioned for himself in the op-ed: an altruistic kid from Johannesburg, out of place in the rapacious, wealth-obsessed world of American high finance. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Stanford Grad &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Smith wrote in the Times that Goldman Sachs &#8220;has veered so far from the place I joined right out of college that I can no longer in good conscience say that I identify with what it stands for.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s document shows Smith as a striver, eager to make more money and frustrated when he didn&#8217;t advance. In his 2010 self-evaluation he made clear he wanted to stay at Goldman Sachs, saying, &#8220;it is my goal to get promoted to managing director.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It creates some doubt, some question about his credibility and whether in fact he had an axe to grind,&#8221; said James Post, a professor at Boston University&#8217;s School of Management who focuses on corporate governance and ethics. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Warped Logic&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Smith, a graduate of Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, joined Goldman Sachs full-time in 2001 as an analyst in the equities division in New York. He was promoted to associate in 2003 and then vice president in 2006. In his book, he describes being disappointed with his $500,000 bonus at the end of that year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;By any measure, I should have felt exceptionally lucky and grateful,&#8221; he writes. &#8220;But by the warped logic of Goldman Sachs and Wall Street, I was being screwed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He transferred to London in 2011 to take a position supporting the desk that sells U.S. equity derivatives to European clients. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Falling Behind &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;By 2012, Smith had fallen behind his peers. According to Goldman Sachs, he was the lowest-paid among the VPs who started in the same training class. A third of his classmates had become managing directors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the op-ed, Smith said he&#8217;d advised some of the world&#8217;s largest money managers and that his &#8220;clients have a total asset base of more than a trillion dollars.&#8221; According to Goldman Sachs&#8217;s investigation, that description is a stretch. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Smith did work for some of the firm&#8217;s biggest clients, including AQR Capital Management LLC, Government of Singapore Investment Corp., T. Rowe Price Group Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and the asset-management units of Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank AG, he had no direct responsibility for those accounts and didn&#8217;t perform an advisory role. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Promotion Denied &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the same time, Smith had, in Goldman Sachs&#8217;s assessment, an overgenerous view of his own performance. The documents say he placed in the bottom half of the firm in regular evaluations from 2007, while giving himself scores that were &#8220;significantly above&#8221; those he received from others. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When his request for a promotion to managing director was denied in January, Smith asked to be moved to a different sales desk. The investigation report says he wanted to generate revenue and cover clients, a step up from the support role he was providing as a marketer and one with a better shot at a bigger paycheck. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs put a different managing director in charge of Smith as it considered giving him a sales job. The report says he &#8220;found the transition difficult&#8221; and considered the female MD who ran the desk a peer and not his boss. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Vague Concerns&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In February, Smith told a colleague he was concerned that the move he wanted to a different sales desk might not happen, according to Goldman Sachs&#8217;s account. A month later, he was gone. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The investigation exonerated Smith&#8217;s managers, saying they had not missed warning signs. When he had formal opportunities to raise concerns or criticize individuals, such as performance reviews, he gave his colleagues top marks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Goldman Sachs, Smith never let on that he was disenchanted or resentful until March 12, two days before he resigned. At a regular meeting with a Goldman partner he &#8220;expressed vague concerns&#8221; about the firm&#8217;s direction and complained that its focus was on making money, not serving clients. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs executives now say they believe Smith had submitted his op-ed by the time that meeting was held. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Taken together, the materials provided by Goldman Sachs challenge the storyline Smith has presented in his op-ed and excerpts from his forthcoming book. Only Smith knows if his public denunciation of the firm was motivated by loathing for what it had become, or instead resentment upon realizing that his career was stuck and a promotion unlikely. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What Smith didn&#8217;t know: His future at Goldman Sachs might have been short-lived anyway. The investigation report says Smith&#8217;s managers &#8220;discussed the possibility of Greg&#8217;s departure from the firm.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Erik Schatzker in New York at  eschatzker@bloomberg.net; Stephanie Ruhle in New York at  sruhle2@bloomberg.net. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: David Scheer at  dscheer@bloomberg.net. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European policy makers who think
Spain and Italy won&#8217;t need aid or new fiscal programs now that
their debt costs have dropped are misreading the markets,
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s Jacob Frenkel said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drop in sovereign interest rates doesn&#8217;t mean the
crisis is over, and outside aid won&#8217;t work without a program to
fix underlying causes, said Frenkel, chairman of JPMorgan Chase
International, in an interview on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;In
the Loop.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The reason why yields have declined is because the market
expects them to have the program,&#8221; Frenkel said. &#8220;The issue is
not just financing, it is adjustment, and if they don&#8217;t do the
adjustment, the financing will just be throwing good money after
bad.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spain sold more debt than planned and yields on Spanish 10-
year bonds fell to a six-month low last week after Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service affirmed the nation&#8217;s credit rating on signs
that policy makers will seek aid. Italian bond yields also
dropped to their lowest levels since March last week, although
they have since erased that decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frenkel said the so-called fiscal cliff, the automatic
increase in U.S. taxes and spending cuts that will take effect
unless Congress reaches a compromise, is the biggest threat to
the U.S. economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) sought to profit last year by persuading clients to buy and sell stock options on European banks such as BNP Paribas SA (BNP) and UniCredit SpA (UCG), according to former employee Greg Smith&#8217;s new book. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We must have changed our view on each of these institutions from positive to negative back to positive ten times,&#8221; Smith writes in  &#8220;Why I Left Goldman Sachs: A Wall Street Story,&#8221; scheduled for release on Oct. 22. &#8220;I remember thinking, &#8216;How can we be doing this with a straight face? No thinking client could believe that conditions on the ground could change that frequently.&#8221;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Smith, a South African who graduated from Stanford University, is the first former employee to write a critical account of his career at New York-based Goldman Sachs. The 143- year-old firm was once the most profitable on Wall Street and counts among its alumni two former U.S. Treasury secretaries and the European Central Bank president. Excerpts of the book were published yesterday by Politico. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Smith, who said he moved to London from New York to run the U.S. equity-derivatives business in Europe, doesn&#8217;t explain in the book how he knows that Goldman Sachs was trying to get clients to trade European bank options. Prices of European bank stocks and other assets fluctuated during the year amid the region&#8217;s sovereign debt crisis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) is releasing its largest set of security products ever as
the company seeks new business amid slowing revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, which disappointed investors this week by reporting
that sales fell in the third quarter, said today it has 10 new
products that will help it gain ground in the market for
business security software, where spending will rise to $21
billion in 2013, according to Gartner Research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For IBM it really is a significant increase in focus on
the whole area of security,&#8221; said Brendan Hannigan, general
manager of IBM&#8217;s security systems division. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got a large
security sales force. We have a channel organization that will
help package the capabilities together.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is releasing products that will help companies control
employees&#8217; mobile devices, mitigate threats from the Internet
and in data centers, and automate some security management. The
company is betting that a wider product portfolio will help it
win business from niche competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Armonk, New York-based company formed its security
division earlier this year, urged by clients who are adding
security officers in top management positions to combat the
growing threat of cybercrime. Companies are storing data
remotely and retrieving the information with mobile devices,
increasing the points of entry for potential theft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM declined 4.9 percent yesterday to $200.63 as investors
reacted to third-quarter revenue, which fell short of
expectations. Revenue dropped 5.4 percent to $24.7 billion, the
company said, missing the $25.4 billion average analyst
estimate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA)&#8217;s
settlement of a merchants&#8217; lawsuit over credit card fees, a deal
that may cost the companies and banks as much as $7.25 billion,
was submitted for approval to a federal judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers today formally asked U.S. District
Judge John Gleeson in Brooklyn, New York, to sign off on the
agreement covering about 7 million retailers. The settlement
would resolve seven years of litigation over allegations that
Foster City, California-based Visa and Purchase, New York-based
MasterCard conspired with major banks to fix the fees merchants
pay when customers use a credit card. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Today&#8217;s filing is an important milestone toward resolving
the long-running litigation between the nation&#8217;s retailers,
financial institutions and payment networks,&#8221; Josh Floum,
Visa&#8217;s general counsel, said in a statement. &#8220;When finalized,
this settlement will bring to an end nearly 10 years of repeated
legal challenges against the default interchange system.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hearing on preliminary approval of the settlement is
expected to be held in December or early next year, according to
attorneys involved in the case. Final approval of the deal may
take a year, said Robert Stolebarger, a lawyer for the
Electronic Payments Coalition, a credit- and debit-card industry
group that has advised the defendants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I fully expect that this will go on for a while,&#8221; he
said in a phone interview. &#8220;I think everyone was prepared for
that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Retailer Opposition &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several merchant trade organizations and large retailers
oppose the settlement, arguing its terms, including releases
from future claims regarding so-called interchange fees, are too
generous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups and companies that have spoken out against the deal
include the Retail Industry Leaders Association, the National
Retail Federation, the National Restaurant Association, the
National Community Pharmacists Association and the National
Association of Convenience Stores, as well as retailers Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. (WMT) and Target Corp. (TGT) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We look forward to making our case to the courts that
this one-sided deal should be rejected,&#8221; the Retail Industry
Leaders Association president, Sandy Kennedy, said in a
statement. &#8220;The outrage within the retail community over this
flawed proposal and the harm that it will cause cannot be
understated.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Formal Objection &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for some of the other groups, Jeffrey Shinder,
said he also plans to file a formal objection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the settlement was made public in July, 10 of 19
retailers who were plaintiffs in the suit have dropped out of
the deal, according to K. Craig Wildfang, a lead lawyer for the
plaintiffs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wildfang said no material changes were made to the deal
since its release. The proposal includes cash payments of
$6.05 billion, an eight-month reduction in interchange rates for
merchants and rule changes that could potentially allow
retailers to impose surcharges on customers&#8217; purchases,
according to court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plaintiffs who did sign on include Payless ShoeSource Inc.,
Photos Etc. Corp., Discount Optics Inc. and Leon&#8217;s Transmission
Service Inc., according to the court papers filed today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The agreement is very much in the interests of the
merchants and those who have objected are either misinformed or
have other agendas, or both,&#8221; Wildfang said in an interview.
&#8220;We are way over the bar for preliminary approval and we hope
and expect that Judge Gleeson will agree with us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Political Motives &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronic Payments Coalition representatives said the
groups who oppose the deal may have political motives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Senator Richard Durbin &#8217;s office has told retailers
that they may lose out on future legislative opportunities to
rein in credit-card fees if they support the settlement. Durbin,
a Democrat from Illinois, secured the inclusion of limits on
swipe fees for debit cards in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, trimming
revenue for the largest U.S. banks by about $8 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa said today in a filing to the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission that its share of the settlement will be
about $4 billion. Other defendants include about a dozen banks,
including Citigroup Inc., (C) HSBC Bank Holdings Plc (HSBA), PNC Bank (PNC),
Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) and Bank of America Corp., according to the
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As with any settlement, both sides had to give a little
or a lot here and there to reach a compromise, and as a result,
no one is entirely happy,&#8221; Stolebarger said in a statement.
&#8220;But in the end, in my view, this settlement represents the
very best and most realistic outcome possible for all
involved.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and
Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation, 05-md-01720, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) raised a $617.3

&lt;p&gt;The fund includes a $372.2 million slice rated AAA that has

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), squeezed along
with other money-market fund providers by low interest rates,
has become the first to prepare investors for negative yields
from funds that maintain a constant net-asset value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constant NAV share classes of the 3.84 billion euro ($5
billion) JPMorgan Euro Government Liquidity Fund (JPMEGAA) and the 13.5
billion euro Euro Liquidity Fund (JPMEULC) will be replaced next month
with new share classes that allow the funds to maintain their
stable value by taking shares from investors, causing them to
lose money, the New York-based bank said yesterday in a
statement. The firm is giving customers until Nov. 18 to switch
to the new share class, to a floating-value share class or
redeem shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not that we think negative yields are imminent, but
we want to be prepared,&#8221; Robert Deutsch, JPMorgan&#8217;s head of
global liquidity, said today in a telephone interview. He said
some institutional investors, to which the funds cater, have
signaled they would still use the fund if yields turn negative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Euro-denominated money funds have been extending the
maturity of holdings, broadening their assets, waiving fees and
turning away clients to prevent record low interest rates from
pushing investor returns below zero. Rate cuts prompted
JPMorgan, BlackRock Inc. (BLK) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) to close
or restrict deposits to euro money funds. The European Central
Bank cut its deposit rate to zero on July 5, pushing down yields
on the short-term debt to which money funds are restricted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Promising Avenue&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Small funds are likely to liquidate should yields turn
negative while large ones will try to accommodate their
investors, and this looks like the most promising avenue for
that,&#8221; Peter Crane, president of research firm Crane Data LLC
in Westborough, Massachusetts, said in an interview, referring
to the JPMorgan announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average seven-day yield on funds that buy euro-
denominated government securities was at zero percent for the
week ended Oct. 12, according to research firm iMoneyNet, also
based in Westborough, Massachusetts. The average yield on euro
funds eligible to purchase corporate debt was 0.05 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No constant NAV cash product has ever returned a negative
yield to investors, according to JPMorgan&#8217;s Deutsch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The share prices of funds with floating values would
decline if investment returns fail to exceed fees fund managers
impose on clients. The same scenario would cause a constant NAV
product to &#8220;break the buck,&#8221; as it&#8217;s known in the U.S., where
money-fund share prices are kept at $1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reserve Primary &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $62.5 billion Reserve Primary Fund was forced to shut
down in September 2008 after losses on debt issued by Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. caused the fund to fall below $1 a share.
That triggered a run on the industry and efforts by regulators
to overhaul fund rules in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid breaking the buck, JPMorgan is rewriting the
prospectuses of the two Luxembourg-registered funds and adding
share classes that allow the funds to reverse the normal process
by which constant NAV investors receive returns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those funds typically maintain a steady share value by
distributing new shares as investment earnings cause total
assets to rise. The JPMorgan funds would automatically reduce
the number of shares by taking some away from all investors if
total assets drop, an action that isn&#8217;t allowed under current
fund rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At the time you redeem, you may get back less than you
originally invested,&#8221; the company said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was the second-biggest provider of money funds
with $372 billion in assets worldwide as of Sept. 30, according
to Crane Data. Fidelity was the largest with $422 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks fell, giving benchmark indexes their biggest declines since June, as Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and General Electric Co. (GE) results missed estimates and euro-area leaders failed to discuss aid for Spain at a summit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft slid 2.9 percent after the largest software maker posted earnings that fell short of estimates. General Electric lost 3.4 percent as third-quarter revenue missed forecasts. McDonald&#8217;s Corp. (MCD) slumped 4.5 percent as sales growth slowed at U.S. stores. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) dropped 17 percent after announcing a plan to cut staff by 15 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index (SPX) SP 500 retreated 1.7 percent to 1,433.19 at 4 p.m. in New York, on the 25th anniversary of the worst one-day stock crash in history. The equity benchmark trimmed its gain for the week to 0.3 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 205.43 points, or 1.5 percent, to 13,343.51 today. About 7.3 billion shares traded hands on U.S. exchanges, 20 percent above the three-month average. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market is saying not so fast,&#8221; said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist for Newark, New Jersey-based Prudential Financial Inc., which oversees $961 billion. &#8220;People have been waiting for positive earnings surprises given that expectations have been lowered enough. In addition, there&#8217;s a perception that the European problems still have to be dealt with. Europe remains a headline risk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks snapped a three-day rally yesterday after Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s third-quarter earnings missed analysts&#8217; estimates. The SP 500 has climbed 14 percent so far this year as economic data topped estimates, companies posted better-than-expected earnings and the Federal Reserve announced a third round of bond purchases. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Earnings Forecasts &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Per-share profits trailed analyst forecasts at half of the 18 companies in the SP 500 that released results since the close of trading yesterday. Since the start of the earnings season, profits have exceeded estimates at about 69 percent of the 117 companies in the SP 500 that released results, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A European Union summit failed to discuss further financial assistance for Spain, according to French President Francois Hollande. Germany and France agreed to enforce common banking regulation for the euro area&#8217;s 6,000 lenders by the end of next year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Home Sales &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the U.S., sales of previously owned homes held near a two-year high in September, restrained by a lack of supply that is pushing prices higher. Purchases of existing houses, tabulated when a contract closes, decreased 1.7 percent to a 4.75 million annual rate, matching the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg, figures from the National Association of Realtors showed today in Washington. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All 10 industry groups in the SP 500 declined today with indexes tracking technology, raw-materials producers and industrial stocks losing more than 1.7 percent. Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) tumbled 3.2 percent to $83.86. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;People got spooked when Google went negative mid-morning and that accelerated the sell-off,&#8221; Donald Selkin, the New York-based chief market strategist at National Securities Corp., said via phone. His firm manages about $3 billion of assets. &#8220;The market had gotten ahead of itself and the news of out Spain that they will delay seeking a bailout didn&#8217;t help.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Google, Microsoft &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Google lost 1.9 percent to $681.79 after rising as much as 1.7 percent earlier. Microsoft retreated 2.9 percent, the biggest since November, to $28.64. The company reported a 22 percent drop in fiscal first-quarter net income to $4.47 billion, or 53 cents a share, amid declining sales of Windows, its operating system. That missed the 56-cent average estimate of analysts polled by Bloomberg. The company also posted sales of $16 billion, missing the average estimate of $16.4 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;General Electric lost 3.4 percent, the most since Nov. 9, to $22.03 after reporting third-quarter revenue that fell short of the average analyst estimate as the decelerating global economy eroded demand for equipment from medical scanners to jet engines. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;McDonald&#8217;s had its largest drop since 2009, falling 4.5 percent to $88.72. The world&#8217;s largest restaurant chain by sales reported third-quarter profit fell 3.5 percent. Sales at U.S. stores open at least 13 months rose 1.2 percent in the quarter, marking the slowest growth in 11 quarters. Analysts projected an increase of 1.7 percent, according to 21 estimates compiled by Consensus Metrix. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (CMG) plunged 15 percent to $243 for the second-biggest loss in the SP 500. The burrito chain criticized by hedge fund manager David Einhorn fell after posting third-quarter profit that trailed analysts&#8217; estimates on slowing store sales growth. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;AMD Drops &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;AMD had the biggest drop in the benchmark index for American equities, losing 17 percent to $2.18, its lowest level since 2009. The second-largest maker of processors for personal computers said that the job cuts will save $190 million next year, enabling the company to break even on quarterly revenue of $1.3 billion. AMD also forecast fourth-quarter sales that will miss analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL) slipped 3.6 percent to $609.84. Shares of the iPhone maker have fallen 13 percent from an all-time high of $702.10 on Sept. 19, driving the stock below its average price in the past 100 days for the first time since July. The shares are still up 51 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Intel Corp. (INTC), the world&#8217;s largest semiconductor maker, lost 1.9 percent to $21.27, while Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO), the largest maker of networking equipment, retreated 3 percent to $18.04. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;SanDisk Jumps &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;SanDisk Corp. (SNDK) surged 2.7 percent to $44.02. The maker of flash memory for mobile devices reported quarterly profit and revenue that beat analysts&#8217; estimates on strong retail sales and high demand for mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) added 6 percent to $60.75. The sixth-biggest U.S. bank by deposits rose after reporting a 45 percent increase in third-quarter profit that topped analysts&#8217; forecasts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A quarter century after the worst one-day stock crash in history, measures to prevent a repeat are failing to keep investors from losing confidence in the market. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 23 percent plunge in the Dow on Oct. 19, 1987, came amid signs of a slowing economy, the threat of higher taxes and concern among individuals that trading was rigged for insiders. Today&#8217;s investors have pulled $440 billion from U.S. equity mutual funds since 2008 and sent trading to the lowest levels in at least four years, retrenching after the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression and the May 2010 stock crash, data compiled by Bloomberg and the Investment Company Institute show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Hedging Demand &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Trading in an exchange-traded fund tracking the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index has jumped more than any other U.S. ETF this year, drawing investors betting that stocks will decline after the biggest rally in three years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Trading in the fund, which is designed to return twice the daily performance of VIX short-term futures, has surged since September on speculation it will rebound from a 96 percent plunge this year. Demand is increasing for securities that move in the opposite direction as the SP 500 amid political gridlock in Washington and a European debt crisis. The VIX rose 14 percent, the most since July, to 17.06 today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a very high probability of a major pullback over the next six months, which would lead to a spike in volatility,&#8221; Steven Ayer, managing director and partner at Chicago-based HighTower Advisors, said yesterday in a phone interview. His firm manages about $25 billion. &#8220;It could come from the U.S. election and the fiscal cliff, it could come out of Europe and it could come in the form of another slow-down in economic growth. All of this could derail this liquidity high market.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft (MSFT) Corp. and Advanced Micro
Devices Inc. (AMD) declined after reporting quarterly results that
fell short of analysts&#8217; predictions as competition from tablets
and global economic weakness squeeze sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the largest software maker, reported fiscal
first quarter sales and profit yesterday that missed estimates
on declining sales of Windows, its flagship operating system.
AMD, the No. 2 maker of PC processors, forecast fourth-quarter
sales that may miss projections and said it will cut 15 percent
of staff. Chipmaker Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL) dropped after
cutting its fiscal third quarter revenue forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following Intel Corp. (INTC)&#8217;s results earlier in the week showing
margins under pressure, yesterday&#8217;s reports underscored the
impact of slowing international growth and a shift away from
traditional computers toward handheld electronics. Some
customers also put off PC purchases before the debut of the next
version of Microsoft&#8217;s flagship Windows operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think people are expecting a big bounce in terms
of PC sales for the fourth quarter,&#8221; said Colin Gillis, an
analyst at BGC Partners LP in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft fell 2.9
percent to $28.64 at the close in New York. The stock has gained
10 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shares Plunge &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunnyvale, California-based AMD -- the worst performer on
the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index this year, with a decline
of 60 percent this year -- dropped 17 percent to $2.18, its
lowest price since March 2009. Marvell retreated 14 percent to
$7.57, also the lowest price since March 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s net income declined 22 percent to $4.47
billion, or 53 cents a share, in the three months through Sept.
30, it said in a statement. That missed the 56-cent average
estimate of analysts polled by Bloomberg. Sales fell 7.9 percent
to $16 billion, compared with the $16.4 billion average
estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the quarter, global PC shipments slumped 8.3 percent
from a year earlier to 87.5 million units, market-research firm
Gartner Inc. said last week. The total PC market will contract
by 1.2 percent to 348.7 million units this year, according to
IHS ISuppli. That&#8217;s the first annual decline since 2001, the
market researcher said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although holiday sales usually kick in this time of year,
AMD is expecting revenue to fall 9 percent, plus or minus 4
percent, in the current quarter from the prior period, the
company said yesterday in a statement. That indicates sales as
low as $1.1 billion, compared with an average analyst estimate
of $1.31 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Marvell Forecast &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marvell, a Hamilton, Bermuda registered company with
operations in California, said revenue for the fiscal third
quarter, which ends Oct. 27, will be $765 million to $785
million, down from an earlier prediction of $800 million to $850
million, as lower PC demand hurt orders of chips that run hard
disk drives. Marvell also said Chief Financial Officer Clyde
Hosein resigned after four years at the company, and named Brad
Feller, vice president and corporate comptroller, as an interim
replacement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is betting on Windows 8, which goes on sale next
week, to lift demand for PCs and get consumers to purchase
tablet machines running Windows rather than Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iOS or
Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Android. Alongside tablets from its computer-maker
partners, Microsoft will begin selling Surface, a tablet machine
that marks the company&#8217;s first foray into computer hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Windows Slump &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of Windows declined 33 percent to $3.24 billion,
missing the average analyst estimate of $3.64 billion. Business
Division sales, mostly Office software, fell 2.4 percent.
Microsoft is betting on Windows 8 to vault it into the tablet
market and restore consumer demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Microsoft numbers are a little worse than expected,
but for Wall Street, it&#8217;s all about Windows 8,&#8221; said Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. &#8220;These are
not substantially off enough to change the fact that people are
largely going to shrug it off and look towards the launch of
Windows 8 to see how that goes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiyear contracts, which Microsoft reports as unearned
revenue, blunted the impact in the latest quarter and boosted
investor optimism for future quarters. Demand from corporate
customers upgrading their server software and paying off
multiyear contracts translated into unearned revenue, a measure
of future sales, of $19.6 billion. That&#8217;s better than analysts&#8217;
average estimate of $19.3 billion, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Corporate Purchases &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although corporate PC purchases, which have been shoring up
results for the last several quarters, have slowed, they have
performed better than the consumer market, Microsoft Chief
Financial Officer Peter Klein said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said a weaker economy, particularly in Europe, is
causing companies to put off one-time purchases of its software.
At the same time, corporate customers continue to sign multiyear
agreements, with such licenses rising 15 percent in the quarter,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poor PC demand and the shift to tablet machines has been
ailing Microsoft&#8217;s Windows unit for almost two years. Windows
revenue has fallen short of analysts&#8217; estimates in six of the
last eight quarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Xbox Beats &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Klein declined in an interview and conference call to
provide an outlook for Windows sales in the current quarter and
full year. He also didn&#8217;t adjust the cost of goods sold numbers
to account for Surface, explaining to analysts that the company
will just see how the device sells first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Server unit sales rose 8 percent to $4.55 billion. Although
Xbox division sales declined slightly to $1.95 billion, they
beat the average analysts&#8217; estimate of $1.62 billion, as Xbox
remained the top-selling console in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The online business saw sales increase 8.7 percent to $697
million, while analysts had expected an average of $689 million,
as the company boosted average revenue per search. Microsoft
also narrowed the loss in that unit to $364 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underlining the relative success of mobile phones and
tablets at the expense of PCs, SanDisk Corp. (SNDK), a maker of flash
memory chips which store files in handheld devices, reported
sales and profit that beat estimates yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of the Milpitas, California-based company advanced
2.7 percent to $44.02, and earlier gained as much as 9.3
percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chicago gasoline strengthened for a
third day after Exxon Mobil Corp. reported an incident at its
Joliet refinery in Illinois and a crude unit was shut at BP
Plc&#8217;s Whiting, Indiana, plant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 238,000-barrel-a-day Joliet refinery released gasoline
and heavier materials from a coker today, according to Tricia
Simpson, a company spokeswoman. BP Whiting&#8217;s smallest crude
unit, with the capacity to process 80,000 barrels, was reported
yesterday to be shut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional gasoline to be blended with ethanol in Chicago
gained 5.5 cents to a 13-cent discount versus New York futures
at 2:36 p.m. The climb follows yesterday&#8217;s 19-cent advance,
which was the largest increase since Aug. 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joliet and Whiting, with a combined capacity of 658,000
barrels a day, account for 18 percent of production in the
Midwest, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Fuel supplies
in the region shrank by 944,000 barrels last week to 47.6
million, the lowest level since June, Energy Department data
show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the West Coast market, California-grade, or Carbob,
gasoline was unchanged at a 10-cent premium in Los Angeles and
at parity with futures in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greg Smith, who resigned from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) with a March 14 opinion piece criticizing the firm&#8217;s treatment of clients, told &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; that he doesn&#8217;t think he betrayed the bank. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t view it as a betrayal,&#8221; Smith said in a portion of the interview released by CBS Corp. (CBS) before the program airs Oct. 21. &#8220;I actually think the leaders of Goldman Sachs today don&#8217;t have the long-run interests of the institution at heart. The idea of the op-ed was not to do any destruction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About $2.15 billion was wiped from Goldman Sachs&#8217;s market value the day the New York Times published Smith&#8217;s article, which threatened to reignite political and popular distrust of Wall Street in general and Goldman Sachs in particular. Goldman Sachs responded by saying that surveys found most employees believed the firm treated clients well. The stock price, which recovered within a week as the company promised to investigate Smith&#8217;s assertions, is up 38 percent this year to $124.42. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;As we looked into his claims I was very pleased to see there wasn&#8217;t merit,&#8221; Edith Cooper, 51, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s global head of human capital management, said today on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;Market Makers&#8221; with Erik Schatzker and Stephanie Ruhle. &#8220;My biggest disappointment in this is that Greg Smith didn&#8217;t come forward and speak to us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) found no support for claims by Greg Smith, a former employee, that the firm has stopped putting clients first, said Edith Cooper, global head of human capital management. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;As we looked into his claims I was very pleased to see there wasn&#8217;t merit,&#8221; Cooper, 51, said on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;Market Makers&#8221; with Erik Schatzker and Stephanie Ruhle. &#8220;My biggest disappointment in this is that Greg Smith didn&#8217;t come forward and speak to us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, is fighting back against Smith, who ended a 12-year career at the firm on March 14 with a New York Times opinion piece that called the environment at the bank &#8220;toxic and destructive,&#8221; and said senior staff referred to clients by the derogatory term &#8220;muppets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Smith has written a book about his career at the firm, entitled &#8220;Why I Left Goldman Sachs: A Wall Street Story,&#8221; that goes on sale Oct. 22. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A 33-year-old South African who graduated from Stanford University, Smith is the first former employee to write a critical account of New York-based Goldman Sachs. The 143-year- old firm was once the most profitable on Wall Street and counts among its alumni two former U.S. Treasury secretaries and the European Central Bank president. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relative yields on U.S. investment-
grade bonds are poised to tighten to the least since 2007 as the
Federal Reserve&#8217;s program to buy up mortgage debt boosts demand
for company obligations, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to own corporate
debentures instead of Treasuries will likely drop to 135 basis
points, or 1.35 percentage points, by the end of the year,
compared with 148 basis points Oct. 17, JPMorgan strategists led
by Eric Beinstein wrote today in a report. The gauge hasn&#8217;t
breached that level since July 2007, a year before the collapse
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., according to the analysts,
whose forecast is lower than a previous year-end estimate of 150
basis points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a &#8220;frenzy&#8221; for high-grade debt that has pushed
borrowing costs to record lows will probably slow considerably,
the Fed&#8217;s open-ended mortgage purchases announced last month to
support housing and boost employment &#8220;is a powerful force for
lower spreads,&#8221; the strategists wrote. &#8220;Many investors hold
corporate bonds as part of a fixed-income portfolio which also
includes mortgage bonds, so the rally in mortgages has increased
the relative attractiveness of corporate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest near-term risk to a sustained rally is that
policy makers won&#8217;t reach a compromise to raise the nation&#8217;s
debt ceiling and avert the so-called fiscal cliff of $607
billion in federal spending cuts and tax increases scheduled to
take effect in January, the analysts said in the report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. lenders may get strong
protections against lawsuits over government-backed mortgages
under rules being weighed by the Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau, according to two people briefed on the process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called qualified mortgage regulations would give
banks including JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC)
safeguards against legal action arising from the underwriting
process, provided the loans are backed by Fannie Mae (FNMA), Freddie
Mac or government insurers such as the Federal Housing
Administration, according to the people who spoke on condition
of anonymity because the discussions aren&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consumer bureau, which is crafting the rules as part of
a broader overhaul of housing-finance oversight, revealed its
plans in a meeting with other federal regulators Oct. 17,
according to the people. Bureau officials have said they will
issue a final rule by the statutory deadline of Jan. 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the rule goes into effect, lenders are expected to
originate most of their loans according to the new standards in
order to gain legal protection from the kind of lawsuits and
&#8220;putbacks&#8221; that have cost banks billions in the wake of the
mortgage crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Howard, the consumer bureau&#8217;s spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to messages seeking comment on the planning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;EU Leaders Seek Deal on Bank Supervisor Starting in 2013 &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European leaders committed to their goal of establishing a
euro-area bank supervisor by year-end, opening the prospect of
direct aid to Spain&#8217;s banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union will seek to agree on a framework that
makes the European Central Bank the main supervisor by Jan. 1,
according to conclusions released early today after leaders met
at a summit in Brussels. The new system, intended to break the
link between banks and governments at the root of the region&#8217;s
financial crisis, will phase in over the next year and could
cover all 6,000 euro-area banks by Jan. 1, 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The supervisor can &#8220;probably be effectively operational,&#8221;
allowing the euro bailout fund to lend directly to banks as soon
as 2013, EU President Herman Van Rompuy told reporters around
3:20 a.m. this morning after the meeting. He said finance
ministers will design rules for such bank rescues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German Chancellor Angela Merkel, underscoring a go-slow
approach, said before direct aid, the bank-oversight system
needs to reach &#8220;practical completion.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called banking union dominated talks at leaders&#8217;
20th crisis-fighting European summit. Leaders praised Greece for
its efforts to meet commitments and secure its next aid
installments, while sidestepping questions of when and how Spain
might secure further assistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU has struggled to maintain momentum on a June plan to
spur investor confidence by putting the ECB in charge of lenders
across the euro area. Divisions have flared over the scope of
the ECB&#8217;s authority and how losses would be shared. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;EU Summit Tussle Over Costs Risks Derailing Bank Union Plans &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French-backed effort to fast-track a European bank
supervisor is running into German-led concern over potential
costs as the region&#8217;s leaders tussle over putting their crisis-
fighting blueprint into action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pressed by counterparts from France to Austria to move
quickly on breaking the link between banks and governments in
the euro area&#8217;s financial crisis, German Chancellor Angela
Merkel demanded a &#8220;thorough&#8221; approach as the 27 European Union
leaders met for talks in Brussels yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French President Francois Hollande told reporters as the
two-day summit began that he was in favor of &#8220;moving forward.&#8221;
Suggesting electoral considerations are holding Merkel back, he
said Germany and France have a joint responsibility to get the
euro area out of crisis and &#8220;we are almost there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU has struggled to maintain momentum on a June plan to
spur investor confidence by putting the European Central Bank in
charge of lenders across the euro area. Divisions have flared
over the scope of the ECB&#8217;s supervisory powers and how losses
would be shared. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A French official, briefing reporters after a meeting
between Hollande and Merkel, said agreements in principle were
possible. He said Finland, Sweden and the U.K. were the biggest
obstacles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The splits over banking may emerge as proxies for wider
disagreements over EU budget rules. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Energy-Trading Unit Admits Error in Apology to FERC &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s energy-trading unit admitted making
mistakes in filings to state and federal regulators as it sought
to avoid losing its authority to trade electricity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan Ventures Energy Corp. &#8220;regrets and apologizes
for its failure to address&#8221; the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission&#8217;s communications in an investigation of JPMorgan&#8217;s
electricity trading in California and the Midwest, according to
a filing yesterday. The FERC has threatened to suspend the
company&#8217;s trading powers, a penalty JPMorgan said &#8220;is not an
appropriate or proportionate response&#8221; to the errors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FERC ordered the company on Sept. 20 to show that it
didn&#8217;t violate agency rules and said it may suspend JPMorgan&#8217;s
authority to sell power and related services at market-based
rates shouldn&#8217;t be suspended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan unit didn&#8217;t discuss the allegation of market
manipulation in its apology yesterday. The company said it
inadvertently supplied the FERC and the California Independent
System Operator Corp. with inadequate information in their
investigation. CAISO manages the state&#8217;s power grid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary O&#8217;Driscoll, a spokeswoman for the agency, said the
commission won&#8217;t comment on the company&#8217;s filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Surging Stocks at Australia&#8217;s Open Prompt Regulatory Inquiry &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trades in about a dozen Australian equities including
Australia  New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) and AMP Ltd. surged
at the open in the absence of company news, prompting inquiries
by the market regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incident comes 2 1/2 months after Knight Capital Group
Inc. (KGC), one of the biggest market makers in U.S. stocks, bombarded
American exchanges with mistaken orders in the first minutes of
trading on Aug. 1. The company blamed the mishap on defective
software. Two weeks ago, orders for Indian stocks improperly
entered by a Mumbai brokerage sent the SP CNF Nifty Index down
16 percent over eight seconds before it rebounded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Australian Securities and Investment Commission has
commenced informal inquiries into the incident, Andre Khoury, a
Sydney-based spokesman for ASIC said in a statement. There
haven&#8217;t been any requests to cancel trades, Matthew Gibbs,
Sydney-based spokesman for ASX Ltd., operator of the country&#8217;s
main bourse, said by telephone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Today was the expiry day for the October ASX 200 Index
futures contracts, which often generates heightened trading
activity as investors seek to unwind their positions,&#8221; Gibbs,
said by e-mail yesterday. &#8220;ASX alerted ASIC this morning and
has been closely monitoring trading throughout the day, which
has been orderly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stocks that moved unusually yesterday were mainly those
attached to companies whose tickers begin with the letters A and
B. Australia&#8217;s market opens in phases according to the
alphabetical order of tickers, ASX said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australian regulators are considering requiring all trading
algorithms to have an inbuilt &#8220;kill switch&#8221; to immediately
disable them if they malfunction, ASIC Chairman Greg Medcraft
told a conference in Sydney Oct. 10. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bank of Scotland Is Fined $6.7 Million Over Mortgage Records &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)&#8217;s Bank of Scotland was fined 4.2
million pounds ($6.7 million) over failures to keep accurate
mortgage records between 2004 and 2011 by the U.K. Financial
Services Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank had mortgage records for 250,000 customers spread
across two &#8220;unaligned systems,&#8221; breaching FSA rules for a
lender to &#8220;organize and control its affairs responsibly,&#8221; the
regulator said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator censured Bank of Scotland earlier this year
for &#8220;very serious misconduct&#8221; at its corporate division that
led to it getting a government bailout during the financial
crisis. Bank of Scotland embarked on a program of goodwill
payments for some customers who took out mortgages before
September 2007, Lloyds said. The lender won&#8217;t ask for the money
back, the FSA said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Bank of Scotland has apologized to customers, co-operated
fully with the regulator throughout this process and has agreed
to pay a fine,&#8221; Lloyds said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lender settled at an early stage in the investigation,
the FSA said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ex-GE Bankers Sentenced in Bid-Rig Scam Targeting Cities &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three former General Electric Co. (GE) bankers were sentenced to
prison terms ranging from three to four years for defrauding
cities and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service in a bid-rigging
scheme involving municipal bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Harold Baer in Manhattan sentenced
Steven Goldberg to four years in prison while Peter Grimm and
Dominick Carollo each received three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three were found guilty by a federal jury in Manhattan
in May of conspiracy to commit fraud by manipulating auctions
for municipal bond investment contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charges grew out of a five-year investigation by
federal antitrust prosecutors into the $3.7 trillion municipal
bond market. Including the three defendants, 15 people have been
convicted in the government&#8217;s investigation into municipal
bonds, the Justice Department has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Carollo, 10-cr-00654, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blackstone&#8217;s James Says Collusion Lawsuit Is Fabrication &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tony James, president of Blackstone Group LP (BX), said
allegations that the biggest buyout firms colluded in bidding on
takeovers are untrue and may have been politically motivated in
an election year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He made the statement in response to a question from
Bloomberg News on a conference call discussing third-quarter
earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top executives at private-equity firms including
Blackstone, Bain, KKR  Co. (KKR) and Carlyle Group LP (CG) assured each
other in e-mails that they wouldn&#8217;t compete on deals to avoid
driving up prices and angering competitors, according to an
amended complaint unsealed last week by a federal judge in
Boston. The correspondence was cited as evidence that the firms
rigged bids in 19 leveraged buyouts and eight other
transactions, including the biggest deals of the LBO boom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amendment to the complaint, which was first filed in
2007, was unsealed Oct. 11 after U.S. District Judge Edward
Harrington granted a request by the New York Times to make it
public. Besides James, representatives for KKR and TPG Capital,
also named in the complaint, said the firms compete vigorously
for deals and there is no evidence of the alleged conspiracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs include the Police and Fire Retirement
System of the City of Detroit, a public pension fund, and a
Minnesota-based investor, Kirk Dahl, who owned shares of
Freescale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Dahl v. Bain Capital Partners LLC, 07-12388,
U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts (Boston). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hong Kong Firm to Pay $14 Million to Settle Insider Trading &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Hong Kong-based firm sued for insider trading in July
will settle the case by paying more than $14 million, the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission said in a news release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC filed an emergency action against Well Advantage to
freeze its assets less than 24 hours after the firm placed an
order to liquidate its entire position in Nexen Inc. (NXY) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC alleged that Well Advantage had stockpiled shares
of Nexen stock based on confidential information that China-
based CNOOC Ltd. was about to announce an acquisition of Nexen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed settlement is subject to the approval of U.S
District Judge Richard J. Sullivan in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interviews &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bankers Warn U.S. of Fiscal Cliff Threat, Nichols Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Nichols, president of the Financial Services Forum,
talked about a letter from some top bank executives warning of
the threat the so-called fiscal cliff poses to the U.S. and
global economies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fiscal cliff refers to $607 billion in federal spending
cuts and tax increases scheduled to take effect in January
unless the U.S. Congress acts. Nichols spoke with Tom Keene and
Sara Eisen on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;Surveillance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;FSA Censure Shouldn&#8217;t Rule Turner Out of BOE Job, Tyrie Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. lawmaker Andrew Tyrie, who heads Parliament&#8217;s Treasury
Committee, said new criticism of the Financial Services
Authority shouldn&#8217;t rule Chairman Adair Turner out of the race
to be the next Bank of England governor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The committee, which will scrutinize the government&#8217;s
proposed candidate to replace Governor Mervyn King, published a
report today that rebuked the FSA for failing to stop Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc&#8217;s 2007 purchase of ABN Amro Holding NV.
The panel said the watchdog showed poor judgment and should have
intervened in the deal, which brought RBS close to collapse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculation on who will succeed King in June is centering
on Bank of England Deputy Governor Paul Tucker, seen as the
favorite, and Turner after the close of applications last week.
Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne plans to announce a
new governor by the end of the year, and former Prime Minister
Tony Blair said in an interview yesterday that King will be a
&#8220;hard act to follow.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the report, the Parliament committee also criticized the
Bank of England and the Treasury for their role. It attacked
Turner for initially resisting a postmortem of the affair. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada&#8217;s Sterling Resources Ltd. (SLG)
said it agreed to sell its interest in a portion of a Black Sea
block to Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) and OMV Petrom SA. (SNP) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction involves a consideration payment of $29.25
million to Sterling upon completion, a contingent payment of
$29.25 million &#8220;upon satisfaction of certain conditions
relating to a hydrocarbon discovery made on the sale portion,
and a further contingent payment of $19.5 million upon first
commercial production,&#8221; the company said in a statement sent to
the stock exchange today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sterling said in May that it contracted Grup Servicii
Petroliere SA to start drilling two off-shore wells in the Black
Sea and that it plans to invest between $500 million to $1
billion in exploration together with Petro Ventures Europe BV
and Gas Plus International BV. (GSP) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petrom, Romania&#8217;s biggest oil company and Exxon said on
Feb. 22 that they discovered what may be its biggest gas find in
the Black Sea after exploring the Neptun Block, located 170
kilometers (106 miles) off the Romanian shore in water about
1,000 meters deep. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sterling said the portion sold to Exxon and Petrom is
located in the southeastern margin of the 15 Midia Block, in
deeper waters and covers 125,000 gross acres, or 11 percent of
the total area of its Midia and Pelican concession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petro Ventures is also selling its interest in the portion
block to Exxon and Petrom, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) lost a bid
for dismissal of a lawsuit by Australian hedge fund Basis
Capital Funds Management Ltd. over the sale of securities known
as Timberwolf and Point Pleasant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York Supreme Court Judge Shirley Werner Kornreich in an
order yesterday denied Goldman Sachs&#8217;s request to throw out
Basis Capital&#8217;s fraud, negligent misrepresentation, unjust
enrichment and recession claims. The judge agreed to dismiss the
breach of contract claim and a claim for breach of implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit, filed a year ago in Manhattan by Basis Capital&#8217;s
Basis Yield Alpha Fund, accuses New York-based Goldman Sachs of
&#8220;knowingly making materially false and misleading statements
and omissions&#8221; in connection with the securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The claims relate to Point Pleasant, a collateralized debt
obligation based on subprime residential home mortgages, and two
credit default swaps that referenced securities from a similar
CDO known as Timberwolf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basis Capital accuses Goldman Sachs of marketing new CDO
investments in early 2007, after the company had already
determined that the value of securities in that market &#8220;would
likely go into sharp decline in the near future,&#8221; and used the
new CDOs as a vehicle to short the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basis Capital is seeking to recover the $67 million in
compensatory damages and $1 billion in punitive damages,
according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to
comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Basis Yield Alpha Fund (Master), 652996/2011,
New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s not easy being Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senators grill you. Reporters compare you to blood-sucking
ocean creatures. Ungrateful former employees trash you in the
pages of the New York Times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Greg Smith, Goldman&#8217;s most famous opinion writer, has
produced &#8220;Why I Left Goldman Sachs.&#8221; It tells the story of his
12 years at the firm, from an internship in the New York City
office in 2000 to the roughly $500,000-a-year job as an
executive director he walked away from in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book has everything from seven Goldman guys in a Las
Vegas hot-tub with a topless 23-year-old (&#8220;Ms. Silicone&#8221;) to
the perhaps less-electrifying image of chief executive Lloyd Blankfein &#8220;walking around the changing room au naturel to dry
off from his shower&#8221; in the Goldman gym. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith describes his journey with a Wall-Street caliber
perspective. That is to say, he has none. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He makes points worth reading, but to get something out of
&#8220;Why I Left,&#8221; you need to come equipped with your own
understanding of Wall Street&#8217;s long history of conflicts,
hype and fraud, which the author mostly skips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Major Conflicts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith gets it right that Goldman (like its Wall Street
brethren) is ridden with conflicts and is flush with revenues
from confusing and hidden fees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy First Gulf Bank
PJSC (FGB) shares before year end as the lender controlled by Abu
Dhabi&#8217;s ruling family will offer a 7 percent dividend yield,
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) said, raising its price estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which has a buy rating on the stock, increased
its price forecast for the Abu Dhabi-based lender&#8217;s shares to
13.5 dirhams from 13 dirhams, analysts including Naresh Bilandani said in a report dated Oct. 19. That represents a 36
percent upside from last week&#8217;s closing price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysts&#8217; projected dividend yield for First Gulf Bank
exceeds the 4.6 percent average for banks traded on the
benchmark ADX General Index (ADSMI), according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Shares of First Gulf Bank have rallied 29 percent
this year through Oct. 18, compared with a 10 percent advance
for the Abu Dhabi gauge and a 13 percent gain for the ADX Banks
Index. (ADBF) First Gulf Bank trades at 7.7 times earnings compared
with 9.3 times for Abu Dhabi&#8217;s measure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see FGB&#8217;s current valuation not fully pricing in scope
for attractive dividend from this name and we recommend that
investors buy FGB shares ahead of year-end&#8221; to benefit from the
dividend yield, JPMorgan said. &#8220;FGB will maintain its strong
shareholder value-driven approach and focus on unlocking value
by returning capital through higher dividends.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lender is set to increase its dividend yield to 7.7
percent in 2013 and 8.9 percent in 2014, according to JPMorgan
estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Gulf Bank may tomorrow report a 10 percent advance in
third-quarter profit to 1.01 billion dirhams ($275 million),
according to the mean estimate of five analysts compiled by
Bloomberg. The bank&#8217;s stock was unchanged at 10:32 a.m. in Abu
Dhabi today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixteen analysts recommend investors buy the shares, while
one has a hold rating on the stock, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, agreed to pay as much as $700 million to buy NextWave
Pharmaceuticals Inc., the closely held maker of a medicine to
treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal includes an initial $255 million and as much as
$425 million in milestone payments depending on how well
NextWave&#8217;s liquid ADHD drug, Quillivant XR, sells, New York-
based Pfizer said in a statement today. Pfizer had paid
Cupertino, California-based NextWave $20 million in the second
quarter as part of an option to buy the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NextWave&#8217;s formulation was approved by U.S. regulators on
Oct. 1. It&#8217;s a liquid form of attention-deficit drugs such as
Novartis AG&#8217;s Focalin that no longer have patent protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This agreement demonstrates our focused expansion of the
Established Products U.S. brands business,&#8221; Albert Bourla,
president of Pfizer&#8217;s Established Products unit, said in the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has been shedding non-drug units like its animal
health and nutritionals businesses as Chief Executive Officer
Ian Read focuses the company on developing new prescription
medicines. The drugmaker&#8217;s shares fell less than 1 percent to
$25.60 at the close of New York trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferies Group Inc. acted as financial adviser to Pfizer,
while Aquilo Partners LP was NextWave&#8217;s adviser, according to
the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy Hartford
Financial Services Group Inc. (HIG)&#8217;s debt as the insurer divests
life-insurance businesses to focus on higher-returning property-
casualty operations, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spreads on the insurer&#8217;s debt will probably improve as the
company refocuses operations and lowers risk in the variable
annuity portfolio, JPMorgan analysts led by Arun Kumar said in a
note to clients today, in which they upgraded the bonds to
overweight. The Hartford, Connecticut-based company may use
proceeds from asset sales to retire debt, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Liam McGee reached deals this year
to sell Hartford&#8217;s broker-dealer, retirement-plans business, a
life operation and individual-annuities distribution unit after
facing pressure from John Paulson to simplify the business.
Paulson, whose hedge fund is Hartford&#8217;s largest shareholder,
urged McGee in February to split property-casualty operations,
such as auto and commercial coverage, from life insurance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hartford &#8220;has largely traded in tandem with its life
insurance counterparts,&#8221; the analysts wrote. &#8220;However, as the
company continues to execute on its plans, we believe it will
naturally trend toward some of the other PC companies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insurer&#8217;s $425 million of 6.625 percent notes due April
2042, rated Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, trade at 128.9
cents on the dollar to yield 4.78 percent, according to Trace,
the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. That&#8217;s up from 102.6 cents on April 26,
when McGee announced a deal to sell the annuities distribution
business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spurt in issuance of high-yield
debt reduced the amount of corporate borrowings maturing in 2014
by 71 percent, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) analysts wrote in a report
last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculative-grade bond and loan sales of $269 billion this
year, have exceeded the more than $250 billion of annual
issuance since 2010. The sales have cut the amount of debt
maturing in 2014 to $127 billion and the total borrowings coming
due in the three years through 2014 has been cut by $767 billion
since the start of 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focus by companies on extending maturities and
improving liquidity has been the main reason for the low default
backdrop, according to the New York-based lender. The U.S.
speculative-grade default rate will decline to 3 percent by
September 2013 from 3.5 percent at the end of last month,
according to an Oct. 18 report from Moody&#8217;s Investors Service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was only a few years ago that credit investors were
fixated on the upcoming maturity schedule,&#8221; JPMorgan analysts
led by New York-based Peter Acciavatti wrote in the report.
&#8220;Record capital market conditions have improved corporate
liquidity and minimized the imminent need to access capital.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of 2014, $188 billion of debt is set to mature,
which is equivalent to the refinancing volume in the first seven
months of the year, JPMorgan said. Maturities for the three
years starting 2012 have been cut by $194 billion, $271 billion
and $303 billion, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds and institutional loan issuance of $82 billion in
September was the second-highest monthly volume on record,
trailing only May 2011&#8217;s $83.9 billion, according to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leveraged loans and high-yield, high-risk, or junk, bonds
are rated below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and lower than
BBB- at Standard  Poor&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects Shell&#8217;s share of U.K. output in fifth paragraph.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) and Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM) agreed to develop the Fram oil and gas field in the
U.K. North Sea after managing to reduce drilling costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partners plan to convert a tanker into a floating
production, storage and off-loading vessel, or FPSO, to begin
extraction within three years, Shell Vice President Glen Cayley
said by telephone. Fram will reach peak output of about 35,000
barrels of oil equivalent a day within two years of starting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s biggest oil companies have sold or scaled back
North Sea operations in recent years as reserves dwindle
following more than 40 years of production. While The Hague-
based Shell installed a rig at Fram earlier this year, it
examined plans to delay the development after U.K. Chancellor of
the Exchequer George Osborne raised oil taxes last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have managed to continue with some focused efforts on
cost reduction,&#8221; Cayley said, declining to comment on the
required investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell, Fram&#8217;s project operator, has spent about $2 billion
a year on U.K. projects since 2005. The company, which pumps
about 14 percent of Britain&#8217;s oil and gas, signed a letter of
intent in June with SBM Offshore NV, the biggest supplier of
floating oil platforms, to secure the FPSO for the field. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc. (DO)&#8217;s Ocean Guardian rig began
work at Fram in July. About two-thirds of the field&#8217;s output
will be gas and the rest oil. The deposit holds about 390
million barrels of oil and gas resources in place, according to
Shell. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jean Wang, who works in fixed-income
sales for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) in London, told her roommate
in 2009 that buying shares based on tips from a Mizuho
International Plc banker she was in a relationship with was
insider trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang&#8217;s former roommate, Jessica Mang, a British
chiropractor, is on trial accused of making 65,000 pounds
($104,000) trading on illegal tips about Canon Inc. (7751)&#8217;s
acquisition of OCE NV in 2009 that she got from her then-
boyfriend, former Mizuho banker Thomas Ammann. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I basically said I don&#8217;t think Thomas should be doing
that, that&#8217;s insider trading,&#8221; Wang testified at a London court
today. &#8220;My impression was it was the deal he was working on and
he was relatively sure it would happen.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mang is on trial with another of Ammann&#8217;s girlfriends,
Christina Weckwerth. The U.K. Financial Services Authority,
which is prosecuting the case, said Weckwerth took in nearly
2 million pounds from her trading on the same deal. Both paid
half the profits they made to Ammann, a lawyer for the FSA said
during the first day of trial last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang and Mang, who were high school classmates, lived
together in central London from 2007 until April 2010. Wang said
they were friends and she didn&#8217;t like Ammann because he didn&#8217;t
treat Mang with enough respect, failing to show up for Mang&#8217;s
birthday and once keeping her waiting for three hours at a
Haagen Daz ice cream shop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Canon Adviser &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ammann, who worked for the Mizuho mergers and acquisitions
team that advised Canon on the OCE deal, pleaded guilty earlier
this year to insider trading and encouraging both women to
commit insider trading. Canon, the Tokyo-based maker of cameras
and photocopiers, agreed to buy OCE in a 730 million-euro (953
million) deal in November 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang said she was surprised to hear Ammann wanted Mang to
make an investment and told her it was insider trading. Wang
said she didn&#8217;t explain what insider trading was to her then-
roommate and only mentioned it once -- a mention that was

&lt;p&gt;LEG NRW GmbH, the German residential
landlord owned by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s Whitehall Street
Real Estate Funds, is considering an initial public offering as
early as the second quarter of 2013, two people with knowledge
of the plan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LEG, based in Dusseldorf, plans to select banks to run the
share sale by the end of the year, said one of the people. Both
of them asked not to be identified because the talks are
private. LEG&#8217;s 90,000 apartments are valued at about 4.7 billion
euros ($6.1 billion), according to LEG&#8217;s 2011 annual report. The
homes are in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany&#8217;s most populous
state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manfred Neuhoefer, a spokesman for LEG, and Roland Leithaeuser, a spokesman at Goldman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which bought LEG from the state government
for about 3.5 billion euros in 2008, is seeking to profit from
the boom in German residential real estate. The FTSE EPRA/Nareit
index of German property stocks has gained 32 percent this year
as investors seek a safe place to put their money amid the
European sovereign-debt crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is one of the most active foreign investors
in German real estate. In 2011, the firm spun off GSW Immobilien
AG (GIB), now Germany&#8217;s third-largest residential landlord by market
value, in an IPO that raised about 468 million euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s Whitehall Street made a failed bid to buy
Baubecon, the residential property portfolio that Barclays Plc (BARC)
agreed to sell to Deutsche Wohnen AG in May in a deal valued at
1.24 billion euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More Liquidity &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An IPO would help make Germany more attractive to real
estate investors by adding liquidity to the market, said Torsten Klingner, an analyst at Warburg Research in Hamburg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The German residential listed market is too small by
international standards and fairly illiquid,&#8221; Klingner said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Annington Immobilien GmbH, Germany&#8217;s largest owner
of apartments, also plans to sell shares in an IPO next year.
Annington, which has 186,000 apartments, is controlled by Guy Hands&#8217; Terra Firma Capital Partners Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LEG is preparing to access capital markets and an IPO is
possible, Chief Executive Officer Thomas Hegel said at a press
conference in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LEG reported a net loss of 15 million euros for 2011,
compared with a profit of 29 million euros a year earlier, after
spending money to upgrade its technology and refinancing debt,
according to Neuhoefer. The company generated rental income of
244 million euros, up from 241 million euros. Funds from
operations excluding sales of properties, a measure of a
property company&#8217;s ability to raise cash, amounted to 112
million euros. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A half-dozen top Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) officials, including Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and President Gary D. Cohn, reaped $14.6 million by exercising 10-year-old stock options due to expire next month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blankfein, 58, collected $3.15 million last week when he sold 68,836 shares purchased for $78.87 each, according to an Oct. 19 filing. Cohn, 52, made $1.87 million selling 40,425, a separate filing showed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, has gained in New York Stock Exchange composite trading in the past 10 years, even as the stock is worth about half the price of five years ago. The six executives sold a combined 320,424 shares last week at prices ranging from $123.92 to $126.17 after buying them at the $78.87 strike price granted in November and December 2002, the filings show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Michael S. Sherwood, 47, the firm&#8217;s London-based vice chairman and co-head of the European business, reaped the biggest gain of $5.23 million as he exercised 115,211 options and sold the stock on Oct. 17 and Oct. 18, according to a filing. In November 2009, Sherwood made about $15.7 million exercising options on 182,860 shares. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer David A. Viniar, 57, who is set to step down from his role in January, made $2.28 million selling 50,751 shares, while John S. Weinberg, 55, a vice chairman and co-head of investment banking, made $1.87 million selling 41,094 shares after exercising options, filings show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sarah Smith, the chief accounting officer, exercised 4,107 options and sold the underlying shares for a profit of $185,681, a filing showed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman Sachs, declined to comment on the transactions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All of the sales took place on Oct. 17 and Oct. 18 after the company reported third-quarter results on Oct. 16, beating analysts&#8217; estimates. Goldman Sachs ended the week at $123.62, up 2.8 percent from the Oct. 12 close of $120.20. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Christine Harper in New York at  charper@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: David Scheer at  dscheer@bloomberg.net. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scripps Networks Interactive Inc. (SNI),
the television home of Paula Deen&#8217;s mashed potatoes, is poised
to lure bids even with the stock at a record high now that the
controlling family trust has disbanded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owner of the Travel Channel, HGTV and most of the Food
Network has the second-fastest projected sales growth through
2015 among 13 U.S. media companies valued at $1 billion or more,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Scripps Networks, which
split from E.W. Scripps Co.&#8217;s newspaper assets in 2008, also
offers the industry&#8217;s highest return on assets at 14 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $9.5 billion corporation&#8217;s revenue outlook justifies a
premium of 30 percent or more, according to Carne Capital LLC.
Edward Jones  Co. said buyers will likely emerge given the end
last week of the Edward W. Scripps Trust, which had 93.5 percent
of the voting rights. Walt Disney Co. (DIS), owner of sports network
ESPN, should be drawn to Scripps Networks as a way to add more
female-friendly content, said Citigroup Inc. and Macquarie Group
Ltd., which also sees Time Warner (TWX) Inc. as a potential acquirer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scripps Networks &#8220;probably belongs in a larger entity,&#8221;
Amy Yong, a New York-based analyst at Macquarie, said in a
telephone interview. The dissolution of the family trust last
week &#8220;puts Scripps into play,&#8221; she added. &#8220;Anyone who doesn&#8217;t
have kind of female-centric or lifestyle-centric content would
want to own this.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;California sold $539.3 million of
general-obligation bonds today in its largest tax-exempt
competitive issue since 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The winning bidder, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), offered a yield
of 2.14 percent on a 10-year maturity, Tom Dresslar, a spokesman
for Treasurer Bill Lockyer, said in a statement. The deal,
replacing previous debt, will lower interest payments for the
most populous state by about $118 million, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10-year rate is 0.44 percentage point more than a
benchmark index of munis, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
so-called yield spread shrank from 0.68 percentage point when
the state issued 10-year bonds on Sept. 24 in a negotiated deal,
and is the slimmest for the state&#8217;s bonds in four years, the
data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re pleased with the results,&#8221; Dresslar said in an e-
mailed response to a question about the state&#8217;s strategy. &#8220;We
always make decisions on whether to go competitive or negotiated
based on what works best for taxpayers.  That will continue to
be our practice.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yields are 1.07 percent for the five-year maturity and
about 3.53 percent for a 20-year maturity, Dresslar said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2007 Sale &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s sale was California&#8217;s largest competitive general-
obligation issue since February 2007, when it offered $1.1
billion in tax exempts and $625 million in taxable bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan submitted the winning bid at a true interest cost
of 3.22 percent for a 20-year security, Dresslar said. The true
interest cost represents the total cash amount of the interest
payments and the time of the interest and principal payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The losing bids were Wells Fargo Bank National Association,
3.24 percent; Morgan Stanley  Co. (MS), 3.280 percent; Bank of
America Merrill Lynch, 3.285 percent; Goldman Sachs  Co. (GS), 3.31
percent; Barclays Capital Inc. (BARC), 3.34 percent; RBC Capital
Markets LLC, 3.36 percent, and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (C),
3.39 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. economy is the strongest
among developed markets as a debt crisis weighs on Europe, said
Joseph Tanious, a global market strategist at JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM)&#8217;s asset-management unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s kind of like the best house in a really lousy
neighborhood,&#8221; Tanious today said at a presentation in
Washington. The U.S. economy will grow at about a 2 percent pace
for the next two years, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tanious joins JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon
in highlighting the potential for the U.S. economy while Europe
struggles, even as tax hikes and spending cuts loom as part of
the so-called fiscal cliff. Lawmakers will find a way to avoid
the fiscal cliff after U.S. elections in November, Tanious said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is in no political party&#8217;s best interest to push the
U.S. economy into a recession,&#8221; Tanious said at the American
Council of Life Insurers&#8217; annual conference. &#8220;You&#8217;re going to
see a lot of political banter, but at the end of the day I do
think an agreement will be reached.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon hosted a meeting of more than 75 CEOs at his bank&#8217;s
New York headquarters yesterday to build support for a campaign
to address the U.S. deficit and avert the fiscal cliff,
according to a person with knowledge of the event. He&#8217;s said
bond markets will eventually spurn U.S. debt if lawmakers fail
to reach an agreement to address the deficit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Dimon has affirmed his faith in the U.S., saying
Oct. 10 that the economy remains &#8220;fundamentally stronger than
people might think.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. economy will grow by 2.1 percent this year and 2
percent in 2013, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
The euro zone may shrink this year and grow by 0.3 percent next
year, economists estimate. Better growth prospects have helped
the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index (SPX) of U.S. stocks rally 12 percent
this year, compared with the 9.8 percent gain of the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index. (SXXP) &lt;/p&gt;

value after MTN Group Ltd. (MTN) plans to raise debt to as much as 40
percent of equity within three to five years, from 2.7 percent
at the end of June, the company said. Sasol has a market value
of 239 billion rand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scandlines, a Danish-German ferry
operator, is being prepared for a sale after owners 3i Group Plc (III)
and Allianz Capital Partners GmbH hired banks to find a buyer,
according to people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and ING Groep NV (INGA) will advise and
finance a potential sale, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the talks are private. Scandlines may be
worth about 1.4 billion euros ($1.8 billion) and attract
infrastructure funds, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major long-term risk for Scandlines is government plans
to build a tunnel linking Denmark and Germany, potentially
reducing a need for ferry use. The Danish-German route accounts
for the majority of Scandlines&#8217; business, according to its
annual report. Denmark and Germany plan to start building what
will become the world&#8217;s longest combined road and rail tunnel
beneath the Fehmarn Belt strait in 2015 and aim to open it by
2021, according to a statement on the tunnel&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials at Goldman, ING, Scandlines and 3i declined to
comment on a sale process, and Allianz Capital Partners couldn&#8217;t
be immediately reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which is based in Copenhagen and Rostock,
Germany, and traces its roots to an 1872 ferry route,
transported 11.5 million passengers, 2.6 million cars and
640,000 trucks on its three main routes last year, its website
shows. Scandlines in May agreed to sell five ferry routes to
Stena Line AB of Sweden to focus on the Danish-German routes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scandferries Group, the holding company for Scandlines,
reported that 2011 profit fell by half to 10 million euros, even
as sales grew by about 8 percent to 611 million euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3i, Britain&#8217;s oldest private-equity firm, and Allianz
Capital Partners, the buyout unit of Germany&#8217;s largest insurer
Allianz SE (ALV), each own 49 percent of Scandferries Group. The rest
is owned by management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two private-equity investors, along with shipping
company Deutsche Seereederei GmbH, agreed in 2007 to jointly
acquire Scandlines from Germany&#8217;s national rail operator
Deutsche Bahn AG and the Danish government for 1.56 billion
euros. 3i and Allianz Capital Partners bought out Deutsche
Seereederei&#8217;s stake in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, &#8220;never seriously&#8221; looked at
selling its commodities unit as lenders consider their options
amid new rules on proprietary trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While we constantly evaluate all our businesses, senior
management never seriously looked at spinning out all or part of
our commodity business,&#8221; Sophie Bullock, a spokeswoman for the
bank in London, said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Volcker rule may cut profit at the biggest U.S. banks
twice as much as earlier estimates if regulators take a strict
stance on limiting proprietary trading, Standard  Poor&#8217;s said
yesterday. Qatar is weighing a potential stake in Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s commodities unit, Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin
Jassim Al Thani said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It seems banks are restructuring or in some cases
curtailing their activities in light of the Volcker rule while
others haven&#8217;t made any changes,&#8221; said Robert Finney, a partner
at Holman Fenwick Willan LLP in London who specializes in
financial services and regulation. &#8220;The extra-territorial
application that would extend the rule to non-U.S. institutions
as well as non-U.S. branches and affiliates of U.S. banks
remains uncertain, as does the interaction with new capital and
liquidity rules under Basel III. Many institutions hope the rule
will be watered down after the U.S. elections.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hedging Impaired &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Volcker rule would impair banks&#8217; ability to provide
commodity-related hedging and financing services as currently
written, Simon Greenshields, co-head of Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
commodities, said in a comment letter to regulators in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue generated by the 10 largest banks&#8217; commodity units
slumped 20 percent in the first six months this year to $3.5
billion from $4.4 billion a year earlier, according to
Coalition, a London-based research company. Their overall fixed
income revenue dropped 1.1 percent to $51.49 billion, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s revenue from fixed-income, currency and commodity
trading climbed 28 percent in the third quarter from a year
earlier to $2.22 billion, it said on Oct. 16. Its value-at-risk,
a measure of the company&#8217;s potential daily trading losses, fell
to $81 million, the lowest since the fourth quarter of 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Commodities and currencies were both negatively impacted
by continued low levels of volatility and volumes,&#8221; Harvey Schwartz, who will become chief financial officer at the end of
January, said on a conference call with analysts that day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities erased
gains for the year today, after climbing the past three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal today reported that Goldman Sachs
held preliminary talks on splitting off its commodities trading
unit in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The carbon capture project linked to
Chevron Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s Gorgon liquefied natural gas project off the
northwest coast of Australia is on track to begin injections in
2015, Australian energy minister Martin Ferguson said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Carbon capture and storage remains the only viable method
of using fossil fuels, which are still favored for energy
security and affordability, while reducing global emissions in
the long run,&#8221; Ferguson said in the text of a speech delivered
in Perth today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia is targeting a reduction in greenhouse gas
emissions of at least five percent below 2000 levels by 2020
with a longterm goal of cutting emissions by 80 percent below
2000 levels by 2050. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will offer its
Surface tablet in China starting Oct. 26, the initial day of
global sales for the device, as the company uses its first
computer to challenge the dominance of Apple (AAPL) Inc.&#8217;s iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#8217;s &#8220;no delay&#8221; for Surface in the China market, Ralph Haupter, Microsoft&#8217;s chief executive officer for the region,
told Bloomberg News in Shanghai today. Apple&#8217;s newest iPad
wasn&#8217;t sold in China until four months after the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is trying to jump-start a moribund personal-
computer market and lay claim to some market share in a tablet
PC category dominated by Apple. Personal computer sales are
forecast to decline this year for the first time since 2001,
according to IHS iSuppli, as some customers spend on tablets
instead, a market where Microsoft currently has zero share.
China is now the world&#8217;s biggest PC market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Chinese market is obviously, as for the whole IT
industry, very important for Microsoft,&#8221; Haupter said after the
unveiling of the company&#8217;s new Windows 8 software in Shanghai
today. &#8220;The biggest number of downloads in the Beta site have
been coming from China on Windows 8, so the interest is great.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Windows 8 operating system is an overhaul of the
product to add touch controls for tablet computers. Besides
touch controls, Windows 8 features a completely overhauled
design that drops the start button introduced in Windows 95 for
a start screen with tiles for each of the user&#8217;s applications,
as well as important people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in the similar Windows Phone design, the tiles
automatically update as new content, such as an e-mail or change
in the weather, comes in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from tablet PCs is expected to grow 26 percent to
$79.4 billion next year, according to market research firm
DisplaySearch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple&#8217;s newest iPad, which went on sale in the U.S. in
March, wasn&#8217;t sold in China until July 20. Carolyn Wu, a
spokeswoman for Apple, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to requests
for comment on Haupter&#8217;s remarks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OAO Rosneft is trading at the
smallest discount in four months to the world&#8217;s most valuable
energy stocks as the Russian company&#8217;s planned takeover puts it
in line to become the biggest global crude producer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State-controlled Rosneft&#8217;s 9.5 percent climb since its Oct.
22 agreement to buy BP Plc&#8217;s (BP/) Russian joint venture TNK-BP, and
the MSCI World Energy Index (MXWO0EN)&#8217;s 3.2 percent drop in the same
period, narrowed the Moscow-based producer&#8217;s discount to 30
percent from as wide as 42 percent on Aug. 31. The Bloomberg
Russia-US 14 Equity Index (RUS14BN) of the most-traded Russian companies
in the U.S. sank for a second day yesterday as crude oil capped
the longest stretch of declines since May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acquisition that would boost Rosneft&#8217;s output to about
4.5 million barrels a day has propelled Rosneft&#8217;s valuation to
8.1 times earnings, the most expensive level since March 2011,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Companies on MSCI&#8217;s gauge of
developed-nation energy stocks, which includes Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s largest energy company by market value, and
Chevron Corp. (CVX), trade at an average multiple of 11.5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Rosneft is a blue-chip stock,&#8221; Adam Mattessich, head of
international trading at Cantor Fitzgerald LP said by phone in
New York yesterday. &#8220;People with exposure to oil and gas, or to
Russia, are taking a closer look at it or have invested.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian equity futures expiring in December on the dollar-
denominated RTS Index (RTSI$) fell 0.7 percent to 144,700 in New York.
The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in the
index futures, rose 4.4 percent to 27.09. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Russia ETF Drops &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg Russia-US 14 Index retreated 1.5 percent to
95.35 while the Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX), the largest exchange-
traded fund of Russian shares, dropped for a second day, losing
0.5 percent to $28.27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosneft gained 3.9 percent yesterday in Moscow to 234.54
rubles, or $7.49, while its global depositary receipts traded in
London advanced 4.6 percent to $7.50. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia&#8217;s biggest oil producer agreed this week to pay BP
$17.1 billion along with 12.8 percent of its shares to buy 50
percent of TNK-BP. Rosneft also agreed to acquire the other half
of the venture from its billionaire shareholders for $28 billion
in cash, according to a statement on Oct. 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal would bring Rosneft&#8217;s output to equal that of
Exxon Mobil. Under the terms of the deal, BP will become a
pivotal
Rosneft partner, with a nearly 20 percent stake in the Russian
company and two board seats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oil Slides &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard  Poor&#8217;s revised the CreditWatch status on
Rosneft&#8217;s
BBB- rating to positive from negative yesterday, reflecting the
possibility of a one-level upgrade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil, which trades for 11.4 times earnings, fell 0.3
percent yesterday in New York to $89.88. San Ramon, California-
based Chevron gained 0.3 percent to $109.71, and trades for 8.4
times earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil, which together with natural gas accounted for half of
Russia&#8217;s budget revenue in 2011, lost 1.1 percent yesterday to
$85.73 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest
settlement price since July 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent oil for December settlement dropped 0.4 percent to
$107.85 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. Urals crude, Russia&#8217;s chief export blend, declined for
a seventh day, the longest losing stretch since July 2009, and
fell 0.4 percent to $106.56 a barrel yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CTC Tumbles &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CTC Media Inc. (CTCM), the Nasdaq-listed Russian media company,
slumped 4.1 percent to $8.87, the most since July 3, after  Igor Semenov, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in Moscow downgraded the
shares to hold from buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures contracts on the ruble expiring in December
weakened
0.1 percent to 31.53 per dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 (SPX) Index fell to the lowest level
since Sept. 5, slipping 0.3 percent to 1,408.75 as the U.S.
Federal Reserve said the world&#8217;s largest economy is still
growing modestly and unemployment remains elevated. The Fed said
it plans to continue its monthly purchases of $40 billion in
mortgage-backed securities in an effort to spur growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RTS Index in Moscow dropped 0.3 percent to 1,457.96
while the 30-stock Micex (INDEXCF) Index also retreated 0.3 percent to
1,451.61, a one-week low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Micex has gained 3.5 percent in 2012 and trades for 5.7
times analysts&#8217; earnings estimates for member companies. That
compares with a 0.7 percent gain for Brazil&#8217;s Bovespa (IBOV) index,
which is valued at 14.9 times estimated earnings, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) trades
at 10 times estimated profit, and the BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX)
has a ratio of 14.9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;United Co. Rusal, the world&#8217;s largest aluminum producer,
dropped 0.9 percent to HK$4.49 in Hong Kong trading as of 10:48
a.m. local time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) and BG Group Plc (BG/) have
approved the Starfish natural gas field development project in
Trinidad and Tobago, Chevron said today in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field off the east coast of Trinidad is operated by BG
Group subsidiaries, Chevron said. Both companies have a 50
percent stake in the project, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;First gas from the Starfish field is planned to come on
stream in the fourth quarter of 2014,&#8221; Chevron said in the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural gas produced at the field will be mixed with output
from the Dolphin project and delivered through existing
pipelines to supply contractual commitments with the National
Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago and Atlantic LNG, said
Chevron. The company, with BG Group, has produced natural gas
from the Dolphin field since 1996, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s decision
to provide information about former employee Greg Smith&#8217;s pay
and promotion requests to the media may scare staff at the firm
about the privacy of their own reviews, Smith said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What are people at Goldman thinking? Are they thinking
&#8216;Is this going to be leaked out to the public?&#8217;&#8221; Smith, 33,
said in an interview today with Stephanie Ruhle on Bloomberg
Television&#8217;s &#8220;Market Makers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, said
Smith was denied a raise and a promotion he sought in the months
before he quit the firm with a New York Times op-ed piece that
criticized how the company treated employees. Documents provided
by the company to Bloomberg News showed one of Smith&#8217;s managers
calling him &#8220;off the charts unrealistic&#8221; in his demands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith, whose book &#8220;Why I Left Goldman Sachs: A Wall Street
Story&#8221; went on sale this week, said the information provided by
the firm about him in a nine-page document withheld positive
reviews he&#8217;d received. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs should have &#8220;released all of my reviews from
my entire career and read them out on air,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;I&#8217;m
disappointed that instead of shooting the messenger that Goldman
Sachs doesn&#8217;t address the issues.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance reviews and comments made in those reviews
&#8220;are kept in strictest confidence,&#8221; Andrew Williams, a
spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York, said in an e-mailed
statement. &#8220;Our people can and do rely on the confidentiality
of that process.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Changing Room &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book, which includes a description of Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 57, walking naked through the
company gym&#8217;s changing room, undermines Smith&#8217;s call for
privacy, Williams added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to imagine that someone who writes a book
describing the company CEO coming out of the shower, calling a
female colleague the &#8216;Black Widow&#8217; and detailing a close
friend&#8217;s bachelor party has much standing on the issue of
privacy,&#8221; Williams said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the wake of Mr. Smith&#8217;s abrupt resignation, we had an
obligation to our employees, shareholders and regulators to
determine whether he had raised issues internally, and the
performance reviews and a wealth of other evidence demonstrated
that he had not,&#8221; Williams added.&#160;&#8220;This was a unique
situation, and our employees recognize that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V), the world&#8217;s largest payments network, appointed former JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) retail- banking head Charles Scharf to succeed Joseph W. Saunders as chief executive officer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scharf, 47, will take over Nov. 1, Foster City, California- based Visa said today in a statement. Scharf moved from his position atop JPMorgan&#8217;s retail-banking division in June 2011, when his duties were reassigned and he was transferred to the private-equity unit as a partner. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scharf is a &#8220;solid, logical choice,&#8221; Tien-tsin Huang, a JPMorgan analyst, wrote today in a note to clients. He&#8217;s &#8220;a proven thought leader in the global payments industry and can run a large organization with a focus on technology. Moreover, the selection of a bank executive to run Visa implies the board is sticking to its core in servicing bank clients.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Saunders, 66, who has led Visa since its 2008 initial public offering and will remain as executive chairman through March, steered the company through challenges to its business model that included new rules on debit-card fees and processing that helped MasterCard Inc. (MA), the second-largest card network, gain market share. Both companies and banks they serve reached a proposed $6.6 billion settlement with merchants over credit-card transaction fees after seven years of litigation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Africa&#8217;s Competition
Commission has recommended the maximum penalty in a price-fixing
case spanning decades that involves six companies including
Chevron Corp. (CVX), Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) and Total SA. (FP) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator, which has referred the matter to the
Competition Tribunal for adjudication, wants the companies to be
fined 10 percent of their revenues in the preceding financial
year, it said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation &#8220;revealed collusive conduct through
extensive exchanges of commercially sensitive information by the
respondent oil companies,&#8221; which also include Engen (ENGN) Ltd., Sasol
Ltd. (SOL), BP SA and the South African Petroleum Industry
Association, or Sapia, the Pretoria-based commission said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies exchanged detailed sales volumes of gasoline,
diesel and other fuels, allowing them to &#8220;align their
strategies in the market,&#8221; according to the statement. High
profit margins were maintained through the sharing of
information that started in the late 1980s and largely went
through through Sapia from 2005, the investigation found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The referral is confined to the production, marketing and
distribution of diesel and commercial sales of the fuel. The
commission is still investigating the respondents in other
product categories. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) has been cutting its stake in Procter  Gamble
Co. (PG), said he doesn&#8217;t have solutions to improve the consumer-
products company&#8217;s earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What goes on inside the place, what mistakes have been
made, what the plans are, I don&#8217;t know the answers on that,&#8221;
Buffett, 82, told CNBC today. &#8220;The jury&#8217;s out on that now,
because they have disappointed in terms of earnings and we&#8217;ll
see what happens. I know the board is actively engaged and
trying to come up with a strategy they think makes sense to take
the earnings forward.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Bob McDonald is under pressure from
activist investor Bill Ackman after cutting PG&#8217;s forecast three
times this year and scaling back price increases that hurt
sales. Ackman, whose Pershing Square Capital Management LP took
a $1.8 billion stake in PG in July, has pushed to fire McDonald
and split the CEO and chairman roles, a person familiar with the
matter has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McDonald is working on a turnaround that includes $10
billion in cost cuts through 2016 and a renewed focus on the
company&#8217;s top categories and markets. PG&#8217;s board in July said
it unanimously supports him and his plan after Bloomberg
reported that some directors were dissatisfied with his
performance and had discussed replacing him. The board said it
would monitor the plan&#8217;s effectiveness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The board and management team are not only fully engaged
but also confident in our growth and productivity plan,&#8221; Paul Fox, a spokesman for Cincinnati-based PG, said today in an e-
mailed statement. &#8220;At PG, we remain focused on execution and
value creation &#173;- we are on track and laser focused.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He declined to comment directly on Buffett&#8217;s CNBC
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Berkshire Stake &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire&#8217;s PG holding declined 19 percent to 59.6 million
shares in the second quarter, according to an August filing
disclosing its U.S. stock portfolio. That represents about a 2.2
percent stake in the company and would be valued at about $4
billion at yesterday&#8217;s closing price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Buffett called McDonald &#8220;a terrific human being.&#8221; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PG, which reports first-quarter results tomorrow, rose 0.5
percent to $67.80 at 9:44 a.m. in New York. Berkshire, based in
Omaha, Nebraska, rose 0.5 percent to $131,168. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) was warned by European Union regulators to modify how it presents Internet Explorer in its new Windows 8 operating system to avert another antitrust clash, Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it would implement changes to Windows 8 before the new version of its operating system goes on sale in two days. The world&#8217;s largest software maker was also sent EU antitrust objections today over its failure to comply with a settlement of an earlier probe requiring it to display a choice of rival web browsers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have raised issues with Microsoft relating to Windows 8,&#8221; Almunia told reporters in Brussels today. &#8220;If a user decides to set a rival browser as a default browser, there should not be an unnecessary warning in Windows or confirmations by the user and the Internet Explorer icon should also be unpinned from the Start screen. We expect Microsoft to address these issues.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft has already been fined 1.68 billion euros ($2.17 billion) in EU antitrust probes, including an 899 million-euro penalty for failing to obey an order to share data with competitors. The Redmond, Washington-based company agreed in 2009 to offer access to rival browsers as a part of a settlement to repair its relationship with the bloc&#8217;s regulators. It told regulators last December that it was complying with its commitments. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Browser Choice &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Robin Koch, a spokesman for Microsoft in Brussels, said the company was changing &#8220;some aspects of the way the browser choice screen works on Windows 8 and will have those changes implemented&#8221; before the product goes on sale on Oct. 26. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Almunia said he&#8217;d contacted Microsoft about Windows 8 and told management &#8220;at the highest level possible what are my concerns and what kind of presentation should be avoided if they don&#8217;t want to take the risk of new investigations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s statement of objections is a step toward possible fines over Microsoft&#8217;s failure to comply with its earlier pledge to display a choice of web browser. The EU can fine companies as much as 10 percent of yearly revenue if they &#8220;breached commitments made legally binding,&#8221; according to its statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft takes the statement of objections listing the EU&#8217;s antitrust concerns over compliance with the settlement &#8220;very seriously,&#8221; Koch said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Technical Error &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Almunia said in July that Microsoft may have misled regulators by failing to display a browser choice screen to users of the Windows operating system since February 2011. The company blamed a technical error for not showing the screen to some users and offered to extend until March 2016 a commitment to show it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft is strengthening its internal procedures to help prevent a repeat of the technical error, Koch said. The company &#8220;will continue to cooperate fully with&#8221; the commission. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company said in July it only learned that month that it didn&#8217;t offer its browser choice software to some 28 million computers running Windows 7 Service Pack 1, or 10 percent of the computers that should have received it. It distributed a software fix to computers that were affected. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Under the terms of Microsoft&#8217;s 2009 pledge, consumers who buy personal computers were given a choice of the 12 most widely used browsers to install in addition to, or instead of, Microsoft&#8217;s Internet Explorer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Repeat Offenses &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Any fines for Microsoft may take into account repeat offenses, Almunia said in July in a reference to the EU&#8217;s 2008 penalty for the company&#8217;s failure to obey an earlier EU decision. That ruling also ordered it to provide information to software developers to make compatible products. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Almunia said there were &#8220;no grounds&#8221; for EU officials to intervene on Microsoft&#8217;s Windows RT software for tablets. The software, to be introduced on Oct. 26, prohibits any browser except for Internet Explorer, according to a May blog post by Mozilla Corp., maker of the rival Firefox browser. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Companies have raised &#8220;various issues about other aspects of Microsoft&#8217;s compliance&#8221; that regulators had examined and didn&#8217;t see any reason to pursue, Almunia said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will remain vigilant and we will continue to monitor all aspects of Microsoft&#8217;s compliance with the commitments in the future,&#8221; Almunia said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Aoife White in Brussels at  awhite62@bloomberg.net. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Anthony Aarons at  aaarons@bloomberg.net. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Central Bank will deploy &#8220;guerrilla&#8221; tactics to contain short-term Spanish bond yields around current levels and punish investors who question its resolve, said Huw Pill, chief European economist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With a Spanish aid request &#8220;a question of when rather than if,&#8221; Pill predicted the ECB will then intervene sporadically to anchor short-term Spanish bond yields near where they are now rather than try to propel them much lower with large-scale purchases. If investors doubt the ECB&#8217;s credibility, the central bank may burn them with losses, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Euro Crisis Blog:  ESM, Europe's Very Own IMF, Will Face Test on Ireland and Portugal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t think the ECB is going to be ambitious in terms of driving down short-dated yields in Spain much below where they are now,&#8221; Pill, a former ECB official, told Bloomberg Television in an interview at the Retail Leadership Forum in London to be broadcast today. &#8220;They&#8217;d rather anchor the short- term yield curve through sort of guerrilla tactics.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What form the ECB&#8217;s Outright Monetary Transactions program will take is being debated in financial markets as Spanish Premier Mariano Rajoy holds out against seeking the bailout that the ECB pledges to support with bond-buying in the secondary market. With Spain&#8217;s bond yields rising again, Pill said an aid request is likely in the first half of November. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer says Windows 8, the next version of his company&#8217;s operating system, will be bigger than Windows 95, an early and much heralded upgrade unveiled almost two decades ago. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It had better be. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bill Gates, then CEO of the largest software maker, introduced Windows 95 when the World Wide Web was still coming of age. While the program met with robust demand, it failed to catapult Microsoft to the forefront of the Internet industry. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the eve of Windows 8&#8217;s release, Microsoft is facing the risk of being left behind again by another technological wave -- the rise of mobile computing in the form of tablets and smartphones, led by Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPhone and iPad. To respond, the company has completely redesigned the software to include touch-screen capabilities. To showcase the new operating system, Microsoft has also broken with tradition by making its own tablet, becoming a competitor to longstanding hardware partners. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s starting to look like the biggest thing that Microsoft has ever done is going to be getting past the next few weeks,&#8221; said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Gartner Inc. who has covered the company since the release of Windows 95. &#8220;They have to match what it took competitors 10 years to do -- oh, and they have to bring partners along with them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;PC Slump &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Windows 8, which will power desktops, laptops and handheld tablets, and the company&#8217;s new device, called Surface, will go on sale Oct. 26 following a kickoff event in New York tomorrow. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft is relying on the software, a product conceived in 2009, to revive interest in the personal computer. The PC market will contract by 1.2 percent to 348.7 million units this year, according to IHS ISuppli. That would be the first annual decline since 2001. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet the software may not be able to outweigh consumers&#8217; growing attraction to tablets and smartphones, which are getting faster and more powerful and doing more tasks people once needed PCs for. IDC, another researcher, is likely to cut its projection for fourth-quarter PC shipment growth, which had been estimated at 4.8 percent, analyst Loren Loverde said. Even that gain would have represented &#8220;limited&#8221; growth for a quarter in which a major new Windows program goes on sale, he said. It&#8217;s also slower than historical growth rates that averaged more than 10 percent a quarter from 2003 through 2010. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Casting a further shadow over the introduction, Intel Corp. (INTC) CEO Paul Otellini told staffers in Taiwan last month that Windows 8 is being released before it&#8217;s fully ready, a person who attended the event said. Otellini told employees that releasing the operating system on schedule was the right move, and said Microsoft can make improvements after it ships, the person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Mobile Moves &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While it&#8217;s betting on a comeback in PC-market growth, Microsoft is also counting on Surface to make a mark in mobile computing. The product will thrust the company into a hardware market it has left to partners since Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded the company in 1975. In addition, Microsoft will unveil a new version of its Windows Phone software next week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The last three and a half years has been in some ways the most pivotal set of products that we have ever designed and launched,&#8221; said Jensen Harris, director of program management for Windows user experience. &#8220;We wanted to shake people loose, to be free to think about what would we do if we didn&#8217;t feel constrained by the past. Taking that leap forward meant taking a risk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ballmer brought Steven Sinofsky, a veteran of Microsoft&#8217;s Office software, into the Windows business to stabilize the flagship product ahead of the much-delayed release of Windows Vista, which shipped more than two years late in 2007 and was met with little customer enthusiasm. In 2009, Windows 7 brought the business back on course in part by appealing to corporate customers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tablet Threat &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, Windows 7 hasn&#8217;t kept consumers from shifting some computer purchases to tablets like Apple&#8217;s iPad. Windows revenue has missed analysts&#8217; estimates in six of the past eight quarters. The company knew it needed to do something drastic to show Windows could go mobile. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We started thinking about if we were to start Windows today, if we were starting fresh, what would it look like?&#8221; said Julie Larson-Green, the vice president who oversaw the design and delivery of Windows 8. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Larson-Green&#8217;s team got rid of Windows 95&#8217;s iconic multicolored Start button, even though some product testers complained. The new Windows&#8217; home screen adopts the tile-like interface now used in Windows Phone, which can be personalized and automatically updates with weather or messages from friends and family. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In another departure for Microsoft, computers with chips based on ARM Holdings Plc (ARM)&#8217;s technology will be able to run a version of the new software called Windows RT. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Strong Opinions&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some people are going to see it and they&#8217;re going to have strong opinions that are going to be negative, and some people are going to love it in a way that they&#8217;ve never loved Windows before,&#8221; Harris said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, Larson-Green said she&#8217;s never been concerned that the design and direction would be poorly received. By the time she and Sinofsky first unveiled it in June 2011, the team had done enough research to feel &#8220;confident but not cavalier,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One thing Microsoft has sought to replicate from Apple is the company&#8217;s famous attention to detail, Harris said. For Windows 8, that meant a lot of time spent perfecting things that previously might have been declared good enough. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Five Buttons &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Swiping from the right edge of the screen brings up five buttons Microsoft calls charms. The Windows logo button exhibits a subtle animation that looks almost as if light is coming across it, Harris said. To get it right, a team of six or seven people spent an entire weekend holed up in an office in Microsoft&#8217;s building 84. Every hour, they looked at 30 to 40 different versions until it was perfect. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;That level of detail has not existed in this product in that way before,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The emphasis on tablets and on touch controls, which IDC estimates will only be available in 15 percent of notebook PCs next year, has some analysts concerned that the operating system is too consumer-focused. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;As far as enterprise is concerned, Windows 8 is Windows Vista version 2 -- it&#8217;s the version they skip,&#8221; said Bob O&#8217;Donnell, an analyst at IDC. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Business Customization &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Larson-Green disagrees. She said the customizable nature of Windows 8&#8217;s start screen means businesses can tweak versions to show exactly what their employees require and to display the latest information in the automatically updating tiles. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With corporate use of the iPad rising, Apple is no longer just a consumer threat. Currently there&#8217;s no version of Microsoft&#8217;s Office productivity software for the iPad, which means the success of those devices with businesses also may imperil growth in Microsoft&#8217;s biggest division. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Office and Windows are bosom buddies,&#8221; said Wes Miller, an analyst at Directions on Microsoft in Kirkland, Washington. &#8220;As Office goes, so goes Windows, and vice versa.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If Microsoft&#8217;s strategy fails, it won&#8217;t be for lack of guts, said IDC&#8217;s O&#8217;Donnell. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s incredibly bold, it&#8217;s incredibly hard to do,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not convinced it&#8217;s all going to work out exactly as they hoped.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Dina Bass in Seattle at  dbass2@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Tom Giles at  tgiles5@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) received a request from the Securities and Exchange
Commission to describe its interactions with Iran, following
reports that ZTE Corp. (000063) resold some IBM products in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM supplied information to the SEC, which completed its
investigation in September, according to documents released
today. As IBM&#8217;s business partner, ZTE is required to comply
fully with U.S. regulations, including economic sanctions and
export laws, IBM said in its response to the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Iran is designated as a state sponsor of terrorism by the
State Department and is subject to U.S. economic sanctions and
export controls,&#8221; the SEC said in an August letter to IBM.
&#8220;Please describe to us the nature, duration, and extent of your
past, current, and anticipated contacts with Iran, whether
through subsidiaries, distributors, resellers, or other direct
or indirect arrangements.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC also requested information about IBM&#8217;s contacts
with Syria, Sudan and Cuba. IBM responded on Sept. 10, saying it
&#8220;complies with all U.S. economic sanctions and export laws and
regulations, including those regarding countries identified as
state sponsors of terrorism.&#8221; In a follow-up letter to IBM on
Sept. 25, the SEC said it had completed its review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Great Seriousness&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;IBM takes its obligations regarding export compliance
with great seriousness,&#8221; Doug Shelton, a spokesman for Armonk,
New York-based IBM, said in an e-mail. &#8220;Our agreements with our
business partners specifically prohibit them from the transfer
of IBM products to Iran. If any of IBM&#8217;s business partners are
breaching our export compliance agreements, IBM will take
appropriate actions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margrete Ma, a spokeswoman for Shenzhen, China-based ZTE,
didn&#8217;t reply to an e-mail sent after business hours local time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, U.S. lawmakers asked ZTE and another Chinese
telecommunications company, Huawei Technologies Co., for details
about their business dealings as part of an investigation into
how their expansion may affect U.S. security. In the letter,
they questioned whether ZTE sold &#8220;highly sophisticated
surveillance technology&#8221; to the Iranian government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House Intelligence Committee began an investigation
last year &#8220;to review the threat posed to U.S. national security
interests by telecommunications companies with potential ties to
the Chinese government,&#8221; according to a committee statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM shares climbed less than 1 percent to $191.60 at the
close in New York. The stock has risen 4.2 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) introduced the biggest overhaul of its flagship Windows software in two decades, reflecting the rising stakes in its competition with Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG) for the loyalty of customers who are shunning personal computers and flocking to mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is the biggest product we&#8217;ve ever done,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said today in an interview with Bloomberg Television, comparing it with the arrival of the PC in 1981 and the introduction of Windows 95. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft packed the new Windows with touch-screen capabilities, designed to vault the company into the tablet market dominated by Apple&#8217;s iPad. To avoid being left behind as computing increasingly shifts to mobile devices like tablets and smartphones, the company radically altered Windows&#8217; familiar design and scrapped a strategy that had it relying entirely on partners to produce Windows computers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;In creating Windows 8, we shunned the incremental,&#8221; Windows President Steven Sinofsky said at an event to mark the product&#8217;s release today at New York&#8217;s Pier 57. Windows 8 and the company&#8217;s first-ever computer, the Surface tablet, go on sale tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares slipped less than 1 percent to $27.88 at the close in New York. The stock has gained 7.4 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1,000 Computers &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than 1,000 computers have been certified for Windows 8, Sinofsky said. That will include the first Windows machines capable of running on chips with technology from ARM Holdings Plc (ARM), instead of Intel (INTC) Corp. Besides Microsoft&#8217;s own Surface, the list of ARM-powered machines includes computers from Dell Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Lenovo Group Ltd. and Asustek Computer Inc. These run a version called Windows RT. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, Surface and the other Windows RT machines will be constrained in competition with Apple because they don&#8217;t work with some of the most widely used downloadable applications. The RT-based machines can only run apps from Microsoft&#8217;s new Windows store, which won&#8217;t feature applications for Facebook Inc. (FB)&#8217;s social-networking service or Apple&#8217;s iTunes music store. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Windows store does have some popular apps, including those from media-streaming companies Hulu LLC and Netflix Inc. (NFLX) Still, Microsoft won&#8217;t say how many apps are available for the operating system, and the lack of a broad range of games, tools and other downloadable software will detract from the Surface in a head-to-head comparison against the iPad and its more than 275,000 apps. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Promissory Note&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Part of me had hoped that we&#8217;d see more killer apps,&#8221; said Wes Miller, an analyst at Directions on Microsoft in Kirkland, Washington. &#8220;Consumers who buy into the platform on Friday -- unless we start seeing an abundance of apps -- are buying into a promissory note that the apps will arrive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Machines with Windows 8 that run chips from Intel can run older Windows programs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Downloadable applications have become central to the way customers use tablet computers, and one of Apple&#8217;s selling points is its leadership in apps. The company introduced a smaller, lower-cost version of the iPad earlier this week, part of CEO Tim Cook&#8217;s effort to keep budget-conscious shoppers from turning to inexpensive tablets sold by competitors such as Amazon.com Inc. The iPad mini is available for early orders tomorrow, the same day Surface hits stores. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Consumer Defection &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The PC market will contract by 1.2 percent to 348.7 million units this year, according to IHS ISuppli. That would be the first annual decline since 2001. Microsoft is relying on the new operating system to revive interest in the PC and carve out a position for Windows in the tablet market, which is picking up consumers defecting from PCs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft has had a lot of interest in writing applications for the operating system and has had to add staff and computers to process and approve the submissions, Antoine Leblond, the vice president in charge of the Windows app store, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because apps written for the program can be sold not just to tablet users but to hundreds of millions of customers who will get Windows 8 on PCs, Microsoft has a chance to win over more developers, Leblond said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft feels pretty strongly that the platform they have built is compelling to both users and developers,&#8221; Directions on Microsoft&#8217;s Miller said. &#8220;Time will tell if both are true.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Miller&#8217;s own examination of the Windows app store indicates there were 7,873 apps worldwide earlier this week, with hundreds being added daily. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Facebook Decision &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, Facebook, for example, only writes apps for Apple&#8217;s iOS and Google&#8217;s Android operating system, and the company opted not to do Windows, a person familiar with the matter said in May. Microsoft could have written a Facebook app on its own using Facebook&#8217;s open standards, which is what the Windows Phone group did when similarly faced with a possible dearth of apps in 2010. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Facebook will or will not decide to write an app,&#8221; Leblond said. &#8220;That&#8217;s their decision to make. We&#8217;re not going to build a native app for them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Leblond also notes that Windows RT customers can go to Facebook&#8217;s website through their browser and get a similar experience to the app. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead, the Windows group focused their budget on workshops to train developers and resources to help them write apps, Leblond said. More than 400,000 people have attended developer camps run by the company, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Besides Hulu and Netflix, the new Windows will also have apps such as the Skype Internet-calling service and Evernote Corp.&#8217;s note-taking tool. A version of Rovio Entertainment Oy&#8217;s Angry Birds game will be available Nov. 8. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;When the store opens, we will have more apps in it than any other store when it opened, and to me that&#8217;s a great sign of momentum,&#8221; Leblond said. &#8220;I&#8217;m much more interested in the momentum that we&#8217;re seeing than what that absolute count looks like.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Dina Bass in Seattle at  dbass2@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Tom Giles at  tgiles5@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) sold its first Surface tablet at a department store in northwest Beijing as the company seeks to challenge Apple Inc. (AAPL), which had offered the last iPad in China months after its U.S. debut. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is the first place in the world where people will be able to get Surface devices in their hands,&#8221; Ralph Haupter, Microsoft&#8217;s chief executive officer for China, said in an interview today at the Suning Appliance Co. (002024) store in Beijing. &#8220;Having it here in China is addressing the capability of the China market, the fact that we produce these devices here and can bring it to a big, big addressable consumer market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Consumers in China, the world&#8217;s largest personal computer market, typically must wait months to get the latest Apple devices. The third generation of Apple&#8217;s iPad, which went on sale in the U.S. in March, wasn&#8217;t sold in China until four months later. Still, a commitment to earlier China sales alone won&#8217;t be enough for Microsoft to unseat Apple, said Shaw Wu, an analyst at Sterne Agee  Leach Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would agree that launching in China makes sense but Apple is already there with the third-generation iPad,&#8221; Wu said in an Oct. 24 e-mail. &#8220;At the end of the day, the product has to appeal with its usability and ecosystem and it isn&#8217;t clear that Microsoft can deliver.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Suning will sell the devices at 500 locations across China, Haupter said, declining to comment on sales or market share forecasts for the device in China. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We all recognize China is a great market to have devices,&#8221; Haupter said. &#8220;The pure number of people using devices in China is giving us a huge opportunity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Chinese Cities &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to the nation&#8217;s capital, Microsoft is holding similar events in four other Chinese cities: Shanghai, Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Nanjing, Haupter said. Sales will follow today in the U.S. and markets including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, and the United Kingdom. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than 600 people lined up outside the Beijing location to collect a number needed to buy the device at the midnight debut, said Xu Lei, a Suning spokesman. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first person in line was Chen Shi, a 25-year-old electrician from Beijing, who said he camped out from 6 p.m. the night before to be first in line. He said Microsoft&#8217;s decision to debut the Surface first in China was &#8220;very important.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This shows the proper respect for the China market, which Apple doesn&#8217;t always do,&#8221; Chen said. &#8220;China is a great consumer market and that needs to be recognized.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second in line was Zhou Qiaochuan, a 26-year-old publisher, who said he arrived at 9 a.m. He said he&#8217;s &#8220;very excited&#8221; as a long-time Windows user who also owns an iPhone and has been frustrated by Apple&#8217;s delayed introduction in China. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Really Angry&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Why do you make us wait so long,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It makes me really angry. China is such an important consumer market and Apple doesn&#8217;t recognize it. That&#8217;s laughable. Microsoft is doing it right.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Apple&#8217;s products are sold later in China than the U.S., many Chinese still get them when they travel abroad, Wu said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Consumers in China who can&#8217;t travel to get Apple&#8217;s products before the local release are forced to pay a markup to smugglers who bring the devices from Hong Kong, said Bryan Ma, a Singapore-based analyst at research firm IDC. Microsoft could win over some buyers by providing an escape from that routine, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;For most Apple products, people have to pay a premium to get products on the gray market in the months it takes Apple to launch officially in China,&#8221; Ma said. &#8220;Microsoft putting China first in the priority list could help to make buyers feel special.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Global Dominance &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, that won&#8217;t translate into unseating Apple from its global dominance, Ma said. IDC forecasts Apple&#8217;s share of the tablet market will rise to 61 percent next year, from 60 percent this year. The share for all tablets running Windows software will rise to 6 percent next year, from 4 percent this year, Ma said. Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Android system will drop to 33 percent next year, from 35 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple&#8217;s Beijing-based spokeswoman Carolyn Wu declined to comment on Microsoft&#8217;s tablet strategy, or how it would affect iPad sales in China. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tablets and mobile devices running the new Windows 8 system are key for Microsoft, as personal computer sales are forecast to decline this year for the first time since 2001, according to IHS iSuppli. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Windows 8 operating system is an overhaul of the product to add touch controls for tablet computers. Windows 8 also features a new design that drops the start button introduced in Windows 95, replacing it with tiles for each of the user&#8217;s applications, as well as ones displaying snippets of information such as weather, news and people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tablet Revenue &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;As in the similar Windows Phone design, the tiles automatically update as new content, such as an e-mail or change in the weather, comes in. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Revenue from tablet PCs is expected to grow 26 percent to $79.4 billion next year, according to market research firm NPD DisplaySearch. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Edmond Lococo in Beijing at  elococo@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Michael Tighe at  mtighe4@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) introduced the biggest overhaul of its flagship Windows software in two decades, reflecting the rising stakes in its competition with Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. for the loyalty of customers who are shunning personal computers and flocking to mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is the biggest product we&#8217;ve ever done,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said today in an interview with Bloomberg Television, comparing it with the arrival of the PC in 1981 and the introduction of Windows 95. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft packed the new Windows with touch-screen capabilities, designed to vault the company into the tablet market dominated by Apple&#8217;s iPad. To avoid being left behind as computing increasingly shifts to mobile devices like tablets and smartphones, the company radically altered Windows&#8217; familiar design and scrapped a strategy that had it relying entirely on partners to produce Windows computers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;In creating Windows 8, we shunned the incremental,&#8221; Windows President Steven Sinofsky said at an event to mark the product&#8217;s release today at New York&#8217;s Pier 57. Windows 8 and the company&#8217;s first-ever computer, the Surface tablet, go on sale tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares were little changed at $27.90 at 12:51 p.m. in New York. Through yesterday, the shares had gained 7.5 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1,000 Computers &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than 1,000 computers have been certified for Windows 8, Sinofsky said. That will include the first Windows machines capable of running on chips with technology from ARM Holdings Plc (ARM), instead of Intel Corp. Besides Microsoft&#8217;s own Surface, the list of ARM-powered machines includes computers from Dell Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Lenovo Group Ltd. and Asustek Computer Inc. These run a version called Windows RT. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, Surface and the other Windows RT machines will be constrained in competition with Apple because they don&#8217;t work with some of the most widely used downloadable applications. The RT-based machines can only run apps from Microsoft&#8217;s new Windows store, which won&#8217;t feature applications for Facebook Inc. (FB)&#8217;s social-networking service or Apple&#8217;s iTunes music store. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Windows store does have some popular apps, including those from media-streaming companies Hulu LLC and Netflix Inc. (NFLX) Still, Microsoft won&#8217;t say how many apps are available for the operating system, and the lack of a broad range of games, tools and other downloadable software will detract from the Surface in a head-to-head comparison against the iPad and its more than 275,000 apps. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Promissory Note&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Part of me had hoped that we&#8217;d see more killer apps,&#8221; said Wes Miller, an analyst at Directions on Microsoft in Kirkland, Washington. &#8220;Consumers who buy into the platform on Friday -- unless we start seeing an abundance of apps -- are buying into a promissory note that the apps will arrive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Machines with Windows 8 that run chips from Intel can run older Windows programs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Downloadable applications have become central to the way customers use tablet computers, and one of Apple&#8217;s selling points is its leadership in apps. The company introduced a smaller, lower-cost version of the iPad earlier this week, part of CEO Tim Cook&#8217;s effort to keep budget-conscious shoppers from turning to inexpensive tablets sold by competitors such as Amazon.com Inc. The iPad mini is available for early orders tomorrow, the same day Surface hits stores. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Consumer Defection &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The PC market will contract by 1.2 percent to 348.7 million units this year, according to IHS ISuppli. That would be the first annual decline since 2001. Microsoft is relying on the new operating system to revive interest in the PC and carve out a position for Windows in the tablet market, which is picking up consumers defecting from PCs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft has had a lot of interest in writing applications for the operating system and has had to add staff and computers to process and approve the submissions, Antoine Leblond, the vice president in charge of the Windows app store, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because apps written for the program can be sold not just to tablet users but to hundreds of millions of customers who will get Windows 8 on PCs, Microsoft has a chance to win over more developers, Leblond said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft feels pretty strongly that the platform they have built is compelling to both users and developers,&#8221; Directions on Microsoft&#8217;s Miller said. &#8220;Time will tell if both are true.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Miller&#8217;s own examination of the Windows app store indicates there were 7,873 apps worldwide earlier this week, with hundreds being added daily. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Facebook Decision &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, Facebook, for example, only writes apps for Apple&#8217;s iOS and Google&#8217;s Android operating system, and the company opted not to do Windows, a person familiar with the matter said in May. Microsoft could have written a Facebook app on its own using Facebook&#8217;s open standards, which is what the Windows Phone group did when similarly faced with a possible dearth of apps in 2010. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Facebook will or will not decide to write an app,&#8221; Leblond said. &#8220;That&#8217;s their decision to make. We&#8217;re not going to build a native app for them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Leblond also notes that Windows RT customers can go to Facebook&#8217;s website through their browser and get a similar experience to the app. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead, the Windows group focused their budget on workshops to train developers and resources to help them write apps, Leblond said. More than 400,000 people have attended developer camps run by the company, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Besides Hulu and Netflix, the new Windows will also have apps such as the Skype Internet-calling service and Evernote Corp.&#8217;s note-taking tool. A version of Rovio Entertainment Oy&#8217;s Angry Birds game will be available Nov. 8. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;When the store opens, we will have more apps in it than any other store when it opened, and to me that&#8217;s a great sign of momentum,&#8221; Leblond said. &#8220;I&#8217;m much more interested in the momentum that we&#8217;re seeing than what that absolute count looks like.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Dina Bass in Seattle at  dbass2@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Tom Giles at  tgiles5@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financial firms including Bank of
Montreal and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) risk losing as much as
$190 million in advisory fees if the Canadian government rejects
C$23 billion ($23.2 billion) of planned takeovers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada turned down a C$5.2 billion bid by Malaysia&#8217;s state-
owned oil company for Calgary-based Progress Energy Resources
Corp. (PRQ) on Oct. 19, raising concern that a $15.1 billion bid for
Nexen Inc. (NXY) by Cnooc Ltd. (883) of China may face the same fate. BCE
Inc. (BCE)&#8217;s C$3 billion takeover of Astral Media Inc. (ACM/A) was rejected by
Canada&#8217;s broadcast regulator a day earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment bankers on both sides of the three deals stand
to make as much as $190 million in advisory fees, according to
estimates by New York-based Freeman  Co., which specializes in
mergers consulting in the financial industry. Freeman uses its
own model to estimate bank fees based on deal size, industry and
nature of the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the case that the deals fail, adviser banks may get
paid a small percentage, depending on negotiation, of the total
fees,&#8221; Lam Nguyen, a director at Freeman, said yesterday. &#8220;In
addition, banks advising the target side may split a percentage,
depending on negotiation, of the breakup fees if there are
breakup fees.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Progress Energy and Kuala Lumpur-based Petroliam Nasional
Bhd., or Petronas, have been speaking with government officials
in Ottawa this week on how to resolve the impasse. The
government ruled the Petronas purchase doesn&#8217;t provide a &#8220;net
benefit&#8221; to Canada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Progress Costs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Progress said estimated fees and costs from its takeover
are not expected to exceed C$22.7 million, according to
regulatory filings. The amount includes  &#8220;employee
obligations,&#8221; fees to Bank of Montreal (BMO)&#8217;s BMO Capital Markets as
its financial adviser and Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) for a fairness
opinion, as well as legal fees and other costs, according to the
July 20 filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Deegan, a spokesman for Toronto-based Bank of
Montreal, declined to comment. Scotiabank spokesman Joe Konecny
didn&#8217;t immediately provide a comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential combined advisory fees for both sides on the
Progress-Petronas deal are estimated at $40 million to $50
million, Freeman&#8217;s Nguyen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transaction costs for Petronas, which is being advised by
Bank of America&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit, haven&#8217;t been disclosed.
Kerrie McHugh, a bank spokeswoman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Success Loaded&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment bankers have the most to lose if deals fail,
said Frank Turner, co-chairman of the corporate group at Osler,
Hoskin  Harcourt LLP law firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re the ones whose compensation is typically most
tied to a successful outcome,&#8221; Turner said in a phone interview
from Calgary yesterday. &#8220;For the financial advisers on the sell
side, the banking fee is usually success loaded.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BCE, Canada&#8217;s largest telecommunications company, agreed in
March to buy Montreal-based specialty broadcaster Astral to
bolster its French-language programming. The deal was rejected
Oct. 18 by the Canadian Radio-television Telecommunications
Commission, which said it would have given Montreal-based BCE
too much control. While BCE has asked the federal government to
intervene to overturn the regulator&#8217;s ruling, it will have to
pay Astral a C$150 million break fee if the deal fails. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s creating huge uncertainty for bankers, lawyers and
anyone else doing deals in Canada, said Mirko Bibic, BCE&#8217;s chief
legal officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Investment Climate&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think people are going to be asking themselves what is
the investment climate today and what is it going to be tomorrow
if the markets and investors don&#8217;t have the clarity around what
rules exist and if there&#8217;s going to be any consistency in their
application,&#8221; Bibic said in an Oct. 22 phone interview.
&#8220;That&#8217;s a fundamental issue that we really need to look at
carefully.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astral said transaction costs were estimated at C$14.7
million, including C$7.1 million in fees to financial advisers.
Royal Bank of Canada (RY) and Montreal-based National Bank of Canada (NA)
advised Astral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of Montreal and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce
advised BCE. CIBC spokesman Tom Wallis and National Bank
spokeswoman Joan Beauchamp declined to comment. Mark Langton, a
BCE spokesman, declined to say how much BCE&#8217;s advisers stand to
lose from a failed deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freeman&#8217;s Nguyen estimates potential total advisory fees
for both sides on the Astral-BCE takeover are $30 million to $40
million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Work Fees &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bankers will not entirely lose out if a deal fails.
&#8220;There&#8217;s usually a work fee, but the majority of the fee is on
a contingent basis on the success or completion of the deal,&#8221;
Eric Castonguay, a managing director at PwC in Toronto, said in
a phone interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work fees are usually non-refundable and are typically
fixed monthly to help cover costs for banks working on the
transaction, Castonguay said. Bankers may also get part of any
break fees if a deal doesn&#8217;t go through, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cnooc&#8217;s takeover of Nexen also faces a government review
under the Investment Canada Act. The act requires the government
to consider foreign takeovers valued at more than C$330 million
to determine whether they are in the country&#8217;s interest and
provide a &#8220;net benefit&#8221; to Canada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nexen Costs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nexen estimates fees, costs and expenses tied to the Cnooc
takeover to be about C$81.7 million. That includes fees to its
financial advisers, New York-based Goldman Sachs, and Royal
Bank, the country&#8217;s biggest bank. Royal Bank spokeswoman Gillian McArdle and Michael DuVally, a spokesman at Goldman Sachs,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential advisory fees for both sides in the Nexen-
Cnooc deal are estimated at $80 million to $100 million, Nguyen
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cnooc, which is being advised by Bank of Montreal and
Citigroup Inc., said yesterday it&#8217;s assuming the Nexen purchase
will get approved. The Chinese oil explorer expects the deal to
be done by year-end and is prepared for all possible outcomes,
Chief Financial Officer Zhong Hua said in a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Co. SA (EEEK)&#8217;s
decision to leave its home equity market in Athens for London
increases the chance that Greece will be demoted to an emerging
market next year, MSCI Inc. (MSCI) said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The index provider put Greece&#8217;s stock market under review
for downgrade from developed status on June 20 and will make a
final decision as part of its annual reclassification in June
next year. The MSCI Greece Index (MXGR) consists of just two companies,
with the world&#8217;s second-largest Coca-Cola bottler accounting for
75 percent by weight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market size &#8220;is the main driver for us to make that
proposal, but on top of that, one needs to admit that there are
still some operational issues that have been present since the
inclusion of MSCI Greece in developed markets back in 2001,&#8221;
Sebastian Lieblich, global head of index management at MSCI in
Geneva, said in a phone interview yesterday. Coca-Cola&#8217;s exit is
&#8220;a very important development, and this is something we&#8217;d need
to assess how investors see this move.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola HBC&#8217;s departure will shave off about two-thirds
of the increase in Greece&#8217;s market size since the end of June.
The country&#8217;s largest company by market value is fleeing the
epicenter of the euro-area sovereign-debt crisis, saying it
wants a more stable economic and regulatory environment. The
company will be based in Switzerland and will trade on the
London Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lieblich said that MSCI&#8217;s decisions are based on
consultations with investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exceptional Decision &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSCI said it won&#8217;t discontinue the Greece index after Coca-
Cola HBC&#8217;s exit. Any deletions from the gauge will be
substituted by the largest constituents of the MSCI Greece Small
Cap Index (MXGRSC), it said. There are currently 22 members in the small-
cap measure, led by National Bank of Greece SA. (ETE) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSCI will &#8220;exceptionally maintain at all times at least
two constituents in the MSCI Greece Index until further
communication,&#8221; it said in a statement yesterday. Opap SA (OPAP),
Europe&#8217;s biggest listed gambling company, is the second stock in
the MSCI Greece, accounting for 25 percent of the gauge&#8217;s
weight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Hellenic makes up 21 percent of the benchmark
Athens Stock Exchange Index (ASE), followed by National Bank, Hellenic
Petroleum SA (ELPE), Hellenic Telecommunications Organization SA and
OPAP, with weights ranging from 8 percent to 5.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shrinking Market &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greek market has lost about 85 percent of its value
since peaking at $273 billion in November 2007 as surging
borrowing costs forced the government to accept two European
Union-led bailouts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market value of the MSCI Greece has risen to 7.9
billion euros ($10.2 billion) from 6.7 billion euros at the end
of June, on optimism the nation will agree on a new financing
package with the International Monetary Fund and European
partners. The equity value is still down from 25.8 billion euros
in June 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall Greek equity market has climbed to 32.2 billion
euros from 23.5 billion euros at the end of June this year. It
would fall to about 26.1 billion euros once Coca-Cola Hellenic
is removed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSCI said in June that restrictions on in-kind transfers,
off-exchange transactions, stock lending and short-selling
impeded Greece from having a fully functional trading place
aligned with those of developed markets. The Greek authorities
had not been receptive to repeated complaints from the
international investment community, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If at one point in time any market doesn&#8217;t provide enough
stocks to clearly represent the investment-opportunity set, then
we may be forced to consider it for demotion,&#8221; said Lieblich.
&#8220;The current sovereign-debt issues that Greece is facing are
not at all the trigger point for the reclassification of Greece.
It is really the size combined with the operational issues which
haven&#8217;t been solved over the past ten years which we see as a
major concern.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) poised to
lose its lead as the largest publicly traded oil producer by
output, acquiring Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC) or EOG Resources Inc. (EOG)
would accelerate growth and help the company regain its lead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OAO Rosneft (ROSN)&#8217;s plan this week to buy BP Plc (BP/)&#8217;s Russian
venture TNK-BP for $55 billion would vault the Moscow-based
company past Exxon in terms of production. Irving, Texas-based
Exxon also is lagging behind on growth, with analysts estimating
only a 3 percent increase in sales through 2014, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with 28 percent at
Rosneft and more than 26 percent at Anadarko and EOG, which have
market values exceeding $30 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Exxon falls behind in discovering untapped oil fields,
it may be forced to buy what it cannot find, Brown Advisory Inc.
said. For Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG), Anadarko is a candidate for
Exxon because utilities from Singapore to Seoul would pay a
premium to import gas it finds off Mozambique&#8217;s coast. EOG would
rejuvenate Exxon with its oil-rich reservoirs in the Eagle Ford
Shale in Texas, U.S. Capital Advisors LLC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Exxon is grasping for investment opportunities that carry
scale,&#8221; Eric Gordon, a Baltimore-based analyst at Brown
Advisory, which oversees $32 billion, said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;The places where oil is domiciled are becoming more
challenging to get access to,&#8221; he said. Exxon is &#8220;being forced
to gain access through acquisitions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BP, Billionaires &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Jeffers, an Exxon spokesman, declined to comment on
whether the company is considering an acquisition in response to
Rosneft&#8217;s expansion. John Christiansen, a spokesman at The
Woodlands, Texas-based Anadarko, and K Leonard, a spokeswoman at
EOG in Houston, said the companies don&#8217;t comment on speculation,
when asked whether Exxon has approached them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosneft, a state-owned energy producer, said Oct. 22 that
it agreed to buy TNK-BP, a 50-50 venture between BP and a group
of billionaires. It will pay $26.8 billion in cash and shares
for BP&#8217;s stake and has an initial deal to acquire the
billionaires&#8217; half for $28 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal will give Rosneft control of more than 40 percent
of Russia&#8217;s crude output and boost its production to the
equivalent of 4.573 million barrels a day, surpassing Exxon&#8217;s
2011 average of 4.506 million. Rosneft&#8217;s output will also exceed
that of every Middle Eastern country except Saudi Arabia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon completion, Rosneft&#8217;s deal will rank as the third-
biggest oil acquisition on record, trailing only Exxon&#8217;s $87.7
billion merger with Mobil Corp. in 1999 and BP&#8217;s $61.9 billion
purchase of Amoco Corp. the same year, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exxon&#8217;s Acquisitions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past five weeks, Exxon agreed to spend about $5
billion on oil and gas fields in Canada and the U.S. Great
Plains, bringing the total allocated to acquisitions since June
2010 to more than $40 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson has been
struggling with production declines as fields discovered decades
ago peter out and national governments in the Middle East and
Latin America prohibit exploration by foreign businesses or make
it too expensive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global output probably dropped at Exxon for a fifth
straight quarter during the July-to-September period, according
to Argus Research Corp. That would be the longest streak of
declines in 13 years, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Exxon is
scheduled to release third-quarter results on Nov. 1. Its
reserve growth slowed to 0.5 percent last year after jumping 7.9
percent and 8.9 percent in 2010 and 2009, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Less Discovery &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon is lagging behind rivals in finding new energy
sources. It discovered enough oil and natural gas last year to
replace 107 percent of what it pumped from wells, a so-called
reserve-replacement ratio that was less than one-third that of
Rosneft, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It also lagged behind
the 148 percent ratio at Anadarko and 167 percent at EOG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon is focused on acquiring companies with vast tracts of
unexplored acreage, rather than firms that churn out large
volumes of crude or gas every day, said Duane Grubert, an
analyst at Susquehanna International Group LLP. in Stamford,
Connecticut. That&#8217;s a shift from the 1990s and early 2000s, when
some of the largest oil-industry deals targeted producers such
as Texaco Inc. and Unocal Corp., he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anadarko&#8217;s wealth of potential future output means Exxon
would need to offer at least $102 a share for the company, said
Joseph Magner, an analyst at Macquarie in Denver. That&#8217;s 53
percent more than yesterday&#8217;s closing level of $66.55 and values
its equity at $51 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Anadarko shares slipped 0.1 percent to $66.49. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prosperidade, Golfinho &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is still trying to determine how much gas is
locked in its trio of offshore Mozambique discoveries known as
Prosperidade, Golfinho and Atum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These are big fields that just keep getting bigger&#8221; as
drilling proceeds, Ernest Leyendecker, the company&#8217;s exploration
chief, told analysts at a Johnson Rice  Co. conference in New
Orleans on Oct. 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anadarko&#8217;s other attractive qualities include a stake in
the Jubilee oilfield on the other side of the African continent,
in the waters off Ghana, and exploratory prospects off the
coasts of Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast. Exxon has been
interested in Jubilee since at least 2009, when it made an
unsuccessful $4 billion bid for some assets of Kosmos Energy
Ltd. (KOS), which discovered the field and is now developing the
project in partnership with Anadarko. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EOG might also satisfy Exxon&#8217;s needs, according to Cameron Horwitz, head of exploration and production research at U.S.
Capital Advisors in Houston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Most Coveted&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has &#8220;one of the most coveted asset bases&#8221; among U.S.
onshore exploration companies, Horwitz said. The company&#8217;s
&#8220;prime asset&#8221; is an almost 650,000-acre tract in Texas&#8217;s Eagle
Ford Shale formation, where wells are yielding crude and so-
called gas liquids such as propane, which command higher prices
than gas alone, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past 18 months, EOG has discovered it can drill
twice as many wells on a given area without draining gas liquids
from neighboring wells, an indication the formation holds far
more reserves than previously thought, Horwitz said. He said EOG
is worth at least $149 a share, a 33 percent premium to
yesterday&#8217;s close of $112.42. That would value the company at
$40.2 billion, compared with Exxon&#8217;s market capitalization of
$417.4 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EOG gained 1.5 percent to $114.09 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;EOG isn&#8217;t just going to give the company away,&#8221; Horwitz
said of the premium. &#8220;It&#8217;s a big pill to swallow. Obviously,
only a very select group of buyers could do that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apache&#8217;s Allure &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apache Corp. (APA), the Houston-based energy producer that
replaced 113 percent of the reserves it pumped out of the ground
last year, is another tempting target for Exxon, according to
Capital One Southcoast Inc.&#8217;s Eliot Javanmardi. The company&#8217;s
market capitalization was $32.4 billion yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Apache shares fell 0.5 percent to $82.36. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apache&#8217;s discoveries in places like Canada&#8217;s Liard Basin
constitute &#8220;an embarrassment of riches,&#8221; the New Orleans-based
analyst said. &#8220;It is a massive, massive find&#8221; that may hold as
much as 40 trillion cubic feet of gas, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Roper, a spokesman at Apache, said the company&#8217;s
policy is to not comment on market speculation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying Anadarko, EOG or Apache would give Exxon a business
that&#8217;s growing at least six times as fast as its own. Analysts
project Anadarko will boost revenue 26.9 percent through 2014,
while EOG&#8217;s sales may climb 37 percent and Apache&#8217;s could rise
20.7 percent, estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. Exxon may
report sales of about $447 billion that year, just a 3 percent
increase from 2011, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;None Needed &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon doesn&#8217;t need to respond to Rosneft&#8217;s acquisition with
its own large deal because it has enough opportunities to grow
and increase production on its own, according to Anthony Walker
of Exxon shareholder Ariel Investments LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would be a little bit concerned if they felt that they
needed to respond to what their competitors are doing because it
probably signals that they would be going after lower-return
opportunities,&#8221; Walker, an energy analyst for Chicago-based
Ariel Investments, which oversees $4.7 billion, said in a phone
interview. &#8220;They do have some avenues to production growth
outside of acquisitions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s biggest transaction in more than a decade, the 2010
purchase of XTO Energy Inc. for $34.9 billion, &#8220;turned out to
be kind of a dud,&#8221; Susquehanna&#8217;s Grubert said in a phone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prices Plunge &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XTO was targeted because of its North American gas fields
and its expertise in drilling shale formations, he said. The
deal proved poorly timed as a supply glut drove down prices.
Natural-gas futures lost more than half their value between June
2010, when Exxon completed its deal for Fort Worth, Texas-based
XTO, and April of this year, when prices sank to a 10-year low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They bought that company for a skill set and a different
kind of gas market,&#8221; Grubert said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Exxon is still working to integrate the XTO
acquisition, the company has a strong enough balance sheet to
undertake another large transaction, such as buying EOG or
Apache, said Todd Lowenstein, a Los Angeles-based fund manager
at HighMark Capital Management Inc., which oversees about $17
billion. Exxon&#8217;s cash and near-cash items exceed total debt by
$2.22 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;XTO was a very sizable deal for them, and they haven&#8217;t
quite harvested the returns yet,&#8221; he said in a phone interview.
&#8220;So they may be gun-shy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, &#8220;there are a lot of assets in play right now, and I
wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if Exxon is looking,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) faces a preliminary
investigation by European data protection regulators who are
examining potential privacy issues raised by changes to policies
for Internet products including Hotmail and Bing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Updates to Microsoft&#8217;s services agreement, which took
effect Oct. 19, are being reviewed by Luxembourg&#8217;s data
protection commission in collaboration with other European Union
privacy regulators, said Gerard Lommel, president of the
Luxembourgish agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. companies sometimes run afoul of privacy concerns in
Europe, where rules protecting individuals&#8217; data are stricter
than in America. Data protection authorities in the EU earlier
this month urged Google Inc. (GOOG) to address concerns about its
privacy policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This investigation is not at the same level as the probe
concerning Google was a few months ago when it changed its
privacy policy, where clear privacy issues had been
identified,&#8221; Lommel said in an interview today. Potential
issues with Microsoft&#8217;s upgrade &#8220;can neither be excluded nor
confirmed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to check whether the amendment to Microsoft&#8217;s
policies could entail new risks for users&#8217; privacy. The
examination is also checking whether Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft&#8217;s privacy policy meets European standards on notice
and choice of services, Lommel said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Services Agreement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robin Koch, a spokesman for Microsoft in Brussels, said the
changes don&#8217;t alter the company&#8217;s existing privacy policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We recognize we could have been clearer about this when
we rolled out our updated services agreement,&#8221; Koch said in an
e-mailed statement. &#8220;We will update the agreement as soon as
possible to make that point absolutely clear.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data protection is currently policed by separate regulators
across the EU. As part of an overhaul of the union&#8217;s 17-year-old
rules on the issue, its executive body wants to simplify the
system so companies deal with only one regulator in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Luxembourg commission, in close cooperation with the
French and other European data protection authorities, is
examining the policy in this case because Microsoft&#8217;s service
agreement with users falls under Luxembourg law, said Lommel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc. (FB), which has its European base in Ireland,
earlier this year was subject to an audit by the Irish data
protection authority into privacy issues with its facial-
recognition feature. France&#8217;s National Commission for Computing
and Civil Liberties, or CNIL, led the probe into Google&#8217;s new
privacy policy, announcing last week that the company must fix
flaws in the update or face possible fines. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazilian swaps traders are
overestimating how soon the central bank will reverse course and
raise borrowing costs from a record low, said Paulo Leme, the
chief of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s offices in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Policy makers are likely to keep the benchmark rate at 7.25
percent through the end of 2013, Leme said in a speech today at
a Brazilian pension fund conference in Sao Paulo. Traders are
betting the central bank will raise the rate, know as Selic, by
75 basis points, or 0.75 percentage point, next year, starting
with a 25 basis-point increase as soon as May, swap rates show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m more dovish,&#8221; Leme said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil cut the target lending rate for a 10th straight
meeting on Oct. 10, bringing it down from 12.5 percent in August
2011, to revive the slowest growth among major emerging-market
economies. Keeping interest rates stable for a &#8220;sufficiently
prolonged&#8221; period is the best strategy to ensure inflation
converges to the country&#8217;s 4.5 percent, the central bank said in
the minutes of its Oct. 9-10 meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developed nations face a &#8220;long and painful&#8221; deleveraging
process that will weigh on global growth and provide room for
Brazil to keep rates at record lows, Leme said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian pension funds seeking higher returns in coming
years will abandon lower-yielding government debt in favor of
alternative investments in industries including infrastructure,
real estate and private equity, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy Inc. (WLT), a producer of
steelmaking coal in the U.S. and Canada, anticipates taking as
much as a $1.1 billion goodwill impairment charge in the third
quarter because of &#8220;recent weakness&#8221; in global demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Preliminary indications are that all or substantially all
of the company&#8217;s $1.1 billion of goodwill could be impaired and
a corresponding non-cash charge recognized,&#8221; Birmingham,
Alabama-based Walter said today in a statement. The company is
scheduled to release earnings Nov. 5 and is expected to report
$34.8 million in net income for the quarter, according to the
average of nine analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowing output from steelmakers and the increased
Australian production have caused prices for metallurgical coal,
used to make steel, to tumble. Prices have dropped 39 percent in
the past 12 months to $160 a ton as of Oct. 19, according to the
most recent weekly data from Knoxville, Tennessee-based Energy
Publishing Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter paid C$5.32 billion ($5.34 billion) in 2011 to
acquire Vancouver-based Western Coal Corp., adding reserves of
metallurgical coal. As slow economic growth damped coal demand,
the shares have declined 40 percent this year, a steeper fall
than the 23 percent drop for the 35-member Stowe Global Coal
Index. (COAL) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given the drop in met coal and slower global growth
expectations, the fair value for the Western Coal assets has
fallen below the value paid by Walter to acquire the company in
2011,&#8221; Kuni Chen, a Stamford, Connecticut-based analyst for CRT
Capital Group LLC, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter rose 0.2 percent to $36.30 at 9:34 a.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A former director of store
operations at J.Crew Group Inc. agreed to pay more than $120,000
to settle allegations that he traded stock based on non-public
information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said yesterday
it settled with Frank LoBue, whom it accused of trading on
store-sales results and cost information before the announcement
of company earnings for the first and second quarters of 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LoBue made just over $60,000 in profit from his trades,
according to the complaint. LoBue didn&#8217;t admit to wrongdoing as
part of the settlement. He &#8220;had been trained not to do insider
trading&#8221; at J.Crew, Scott Friestad, an associate director in
the SEC&#8217;s enforcement division, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Heim, a partner at Meyers  Heim LLP in New York who
represents LoBue, said his client &#8220;is looking forward to
putting this behind him and moving on.&#8221; Heim declined to
comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friestad said that while insider-trading cases often center
on &#8220;one-time events like a takeover, this case is a reminder
that there is a lot of market-moving information that employees
routinely come in possession of and they need to be careful not
to trade in those circumstances.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J.Crew was bought by private equity firms TPG Capital LP
and Leonard Green  Partners LP last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. LoBue,
12-cv-07944, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SEC Approves Mortgage Trade Disclosure Rules for Finra&#8217;s Trace &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved rules
intended to increase transparency in a corner of the market for
mortgage- and asset-backed bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC agreed to a plan by the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority to create public reporting for trades of
so-called specified government-backed mortgage bonds and
securities tied to Small Business Administration loans,
according to an Oct. 23 notice posted on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protocols for disclosures through Finra&#8217;s Trace system
will allow for the unique identifiers of bonds called CUSIPs to
be hidden, in favor of generic information about the securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finra has been expanding Trace to securitized debt after
the opacity of trading in securities including mortgage bonds
without government backing contributed to the worst financial
crisis since the Great Depression in 2008, by fueling doubt
about the health of banks and funds. The non-governmental
regulator oversees more than 4,000 brokerage firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trace system started in 2002, providing the first real-time data on most corporate bond trading to anyone with Internet
access. Finra, which operates from Washington and New York,
began last year disclosing daily market-level information culled
from data on individual securitized-debt trades it had started
collecting earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CFTC Said to Allow More Swaps Trading Via Phone in Final Rule &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commodity Futures Trading Commission will allow more
swaps to be traded over the phone than initially indicated under
proposed Dodd-Frank Act reforms, according to people familiar
with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman Gary Gensler outlined the changes in a meeting
earlier this week in New York with executives of firms that want
to create regulated entities allowed to trade swaps, known as
swap execution facilities, or SEFs, according to two people who
attended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The details of what will be allowed are still being worked
out for the final draft rule, according to one of the people,
who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change in phone trading contrasts with the proposal
written in the Federal Register in January 2011, which said that
&#8220;entities offering the following services do not comply with
the statutory definition of a SEF: one-to-one voice services for
the execution or trading of swaps (other than for the execution
of block trades).&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trades in interest-rate, credit-default and other types of
swaps historically have been done over the phone in negotiations
between banks and their customers. Gensler, with the backing of
Congress through the Dodd-Frank reforms passed in 2010, has made
electronic trading of the instruments a central feature of
regulation in a market with $648 trillion of contracts
outstanding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Gary, a CFTC spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expanded phone trading would be a victory for inter-dealer
brokers who facilitate transactions between banks. The firms,
which use a combination of phone and computer trading to match
buyers and sellers, lobbied the CFTC through the Wholesale
Market Brokers Association, Americas to allow flexible methods
of trading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hertz Bid for Dollar Thrifty Said to Raise Concerns at FTC &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (HTZ)&#8217;s bid for antitrust clearance to
buy Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group Inc. is meeting resistance
at the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, according to people
familiar with the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An understanding that the deal could be approved with
conditions, reached with the FTC&#8217;s Bureau of Competition, faces
opposition at the agency&#8217;s Bureau of Economics, where some
staffers think the $2.6 billion merger should be blocked, said
the people, who declined to be identified because the matter
isn&#8217;t public. The two bureaus submit their recommendations to
the five-member commission, which makes the final decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hertz, based in Park Ridge, New Jersey, announced the
acquisition on Aug. 26 and it said it expected FTC approval by
mid-October. On Oct. 18, Hertz extended the deadline for the FTC
to rule on the transaction to Nov. 16 from Oct. 31 because the
agency needed more time to complete its review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hertz, which has sought to take over Dollar Thrifty for
more than five years, agreed to sell its Advantage brand to
address concerns that the deal would crimp competition in the
rental-car market, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;EU May Toughen Commodity Swaps Curbs in Financial Market Law &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodity derivative speculators may face tougher curbs
under compromise plans to overhaul the European Union&#8217;s
financial market rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governments may seek to restrict the number of commodity-derivative contracts that traders can enter into, according to a
draft version of the rules prepared by Cyprus, which holds the
rotating presidency of the EU. Such a requirement would go
beyond a draft law published last year by Michel Barnier, the
EU&#8217;s financial services chief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The position-limit rule wouldn&#8217;t apply in cases where
businesses are trying to use the derivatives to shield
themselves from losses on investments, according to the
documents. Regulators would also have some, limited power to
grant other case-by-case exemptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aid organizations and some governments, including France
and Germany, have demanded restrictions on commodity derivatives
speculation, which they blame for worldwide spikes in food
prices. The Institute of International Finance, an association
representing global lenders, has said there is &#8220;little
convincing evidence linking financial investment with trends in
commodity prices and volatility.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnier&#8217;s proposals, published last year, would have given
regulators the chance to find alternatives to position limits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking to lawmakers in the European Parliament yesterday,
Barnier said he backed moves to toughen the planned measures for
commodity derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Treasury, Fed Reject Call to Stop Using Libor Rates in TARP &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve
defended the use of Libor in rates tied to the Troubled Asset
Relief Program, rejecting a request from the watchdog of the
U.S. financial crisis bailouts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither the Treasury nor the Fed has &#8220;the authority to
change unilaterally the interest rate on the small number of
remaining loans that rely on Libor,&#8221; Timothy Massad, the
Treasury&#8217;s assistant secretary for financial stability, said in
a letter to Christy Romero, special inspector general for TARP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If we sought to renegotiate the rate, it is likely that
borrowers either would not agree to a rate change or would agree
only to a change that would result in a lower payment to the
taxpayers,&#8221; according to the Oct. 9 letter obtained by
Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romero had asked the Treasury and Fed to use other
reference rates instead of Libor for Treasury&#8217;s Public-Private
Investment Program, or PPIP, and the Fed&#8217;s Term Asset-Backed
Securities Loan Facility, or TALF. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. taxpayers &#8220;may have been at risk and may continue to
be at risk from the manipulation of Libor,&#8221; the London
interbank offered rate, Romero said in an August letter to Fed
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Timothy F.
Geithner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Citigroup Inc. (C) and Royal Bank of
Scotland Plc are among the banks under investigation for Libor-rate tampering. Barclays Plc (BARC), Britain&#8217;s second-biggest lender by
assets, was fined $450 million in June when it became the first
bank to settle with regulators over the rigging of interest
rates. Chief Executive Officer Robert Diamond and Chairman
Marcus Agius resigned in the aftermath. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The time for Treasury and the Federal Reserve to act is
now, rather than wait for global Libor reform, because there are
$598.6 million in outstanding TALF loans and $5.685 billion in
outstanding PPIP debt with interest rates tied to Libor,&#8221; the
special inspector general for TARP said in a quarterly report to
Congress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SocGen, RBC Among Banks Said to Get N.Y. Libor Probe Subpoenas &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Societe Generale SA (GLE), Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of
America Corp. are among nine additional banks that were
subpoenaed in New York and Connecticut&#8217;s probe of alleged
manipulation of Libor, a person familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subpoenas, issued by New York Attorney General Eric
Schneiderman starting in August, bring to 16 the total number of
banks that have been subpoenaed in the states&#8217; investigation,
said the person, who asked not to be identified because there
wasn&#8217;t authorization to speak publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schneiderman and Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen
are jointly investigating claims that banks rigged the London
interbank offered rate, or Libor, a worldwide benchmark for
borrowing. The same person said in August that seven banks were
subpoenaed in their investigation, including JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) and Barclays Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The states are coordinating with &#8220;a much larger group of
attorneys general,&#8221; Susan Kinsman, a spokeswoman for the
Connecticut attorney general, said in September. Florida
Attorney General Pam Bondi has also issued subpoenas to more
than a dozen financial institutions, including UBS AG (UBS), Deutsche
Bank AG (DBK) and HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides Societe Generale, Royal Bank of Canada (RY) and Bank of
America, the other six banks to receive subpoenas from New York
are: Credit Suisse Group AG (CS), Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.,
Norinchukin Bank, Rabobank, Lloyd&#8217;s Banking Group Plc and West
LB AG, a German lender that ceased operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives of those banks couldn&#8217;t be reached for
comment or declined to comment on the subpoenas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lloyd&#8217;s has said it is assisting various regulators in
their investigations into the setting of Libor. Royal Bank of
Canada has said it is cooperating with regulators and found no
evidence of collusion with other banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabobank said in a report this year that it has received
subpoenas and requests for information from regulatory agencies
in the U.S., Europe and Asia and is cooperating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melissa Grace, a spokeswoman for Schneiderman, and Jaclyn
Falkowski, a spokeswoman for Jepsen, declined to comment on the
probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IBM Received Request From SEC Over Dealings With Iran, ZTE &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) received a request
from the Securities and Exchange Commission to describe its
interactions with Iran, following reports that ZTE Corp. (000063) resold
some IBM products in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM supplied information to the SEC, which completed its
investigation in September, according to documents released
yesterday. As IBM&#8217;s business partner, ZTE is required to comply
fully with U.S. regulations, including economic sanctions and
export laws, IBM said in its response to the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Iran is designated as a state sponsor of terrorism by the
State Department and is subject to U.S. economic sanctions and
export controls,&#8221; the SEC said in an August letter to IBM.
&#8220;Please describe to us the nature, duration, and extent of your
past, current, and anticipated contacts with Iran, whether
through subsidiaries, distributors, resellers, or other direct
or indirect arrangements.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC also requested information about IBM&#8217;s contacts
with Syria, Sudan and Cuba. IBM responded on Sept. 10, saying it
&#8220;complies with all U.S. economic sanctions and export laws and
regulations, including those regarding countries identified as
state sponsors of terrorism.&#8221; In a follow-up letter to IBM on
Sept. 25, the SEC said it had completed its review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ed Barbini, a spokesman for Armonk, New York-based IBM,
didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a request for comment. Margrete
Ma, a spokeswoman at Shenzhen, China-based ZTE, didn&#8217;t reply to
an e-mail sent after business hours local time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ex-JPMorgan Trader Fired for Aluminum Mispricing Loses Lawsuit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former JPMorgan Chase  Co. commodities trader, fired for
mispricing aluminum trades, lost a lawsuit against the bank when
a London judge ruled he couldn&#8217;t explain why the errors had all
been profitable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daragh Nott, who was fired in September after the bank
found as many as 90 erroneous trades, sued for unfair dismissal
at an employment tribunal saying he had made honest mistakes as
a result of the pressure of his job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nott &#8220;failed to answer adequately why the large number of
errors he had made on the aluminum book all favored his&#8221;
account, adding about $400,000 to his 2010 trading profits,
according to an Oct. 17 written decision from employment judge
A. Isaacson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment banks have reduced bonuses, shed jobs and
increased scrutiny of staff in the wake of losses from the 2008
financial crisis, leading to a rising number of employment
disputes in London courts and tribunals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nott&#8217;s lawyer Richard Woolmer didn&#8217;t respond to an e-mail
seeking comment. JPMorgan spokeswoman Kate Haywood declined to
comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank in March won a case in which a
currency trader sought about 580,000 pounds ($935,000) over a
missing decimal point in his contract. Commerzbank AG was
ordered in May to pay 50 million euros ($65 million) to more
than 100 Dresdner Kleinwort bankers who sued after the lender
slashed bonuses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan found after an internal probe that the odds of all
Nott&#8217;s mistakes benefiting his trading book were as much as a-trillion-to-one, Isaacson said in her judgment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a hearing in September, Nott admitted to making
&#8220;numerous errors across all books due to the nature of,&#8221; and
pressures that went with, his job. He said his health suffered
as a result of being fired and the internal company appeal
process he used to try to get it back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rajaratnam Appellate Judges Voice Concern Over U.S. Wiretap Bid &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judges hearing the appeal of Galleon Group LLC co-founder
Raj Rajaratnam, who is serving 11 years in prison for insider
trading, voiced concern over whether prosecutors improperly won
authority to wiretap his phone calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A three-judge panel in Manhattan heard arguments yesterday
over whether to reverse Rajaratnam&#8217;s conviction for insider
trading. The central issue is whether prosecutors misled the
lower court judge who authorized the wiretaps in 2008 by
omitting key facts from their request, and if Rajaratnam&#8217;s
conviction should be overturned as a result. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What happens if we agree with you? Does this mean it&#8217;s a
new trial?&#8221; U.S. Circuit Judge Robert Sack asked Rajaratnam&#8217;s
lawyer, Patricia Ann Millett, at the start of the argument. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second judge, Jose Cabranes, suggested in his questions
that prosecutors acted properly. The third judge, Susan Carney,
asked Millett what the &#8220;remedy&#8221; would be if the judges agreed
that prosecutors had misled the district court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam was convicted of directing the biggest hedge
fund insider-trading scheme in U.S. history. At the trial, the
government introduced 45 wiretap recordings, along with
documents and testimony derived from the wiretaps. That evidence
must be thrown out and his conviction overturned, his lawyers
argued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kozlowski Sues New York Parole Board for Denying Release &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L. Dennis Kozlowski, the former Tyco International Ltd. (TYC)
chief executive officer convicted in 2005 of looting the
company, sued New York&#8217;s parole board for refusing to release
him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board in April denied the 65-year-old Kozlowski&#8217;s
request for parole in April &#8220;due to concern for the public
safety and welfare.&#8221; Kozlowski was sentenced to 8 1/3 to 25
years in prison in 2005 after a Manhattan jury found him guilty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a petition filed Oct. 24 in New York State Supreme
Court, Kozlowski asked a judge to annul the decision and grant
his application for parole or give him a new hearing, saying
that the board relied on erroneous information in making its
ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The parole board denied petitioner parole using non-statutory factors, impermissibly conclusory reasoning, and
incorrect information,&#8221; Kozlowski said. &#8220;The board&#8217;s arbitrary
and capricious decision violated petitioner&#8217;s due process.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York State Department of Corrections and Community
Supervision, which operates the parole board, didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Kozlowski v. New York State Board of Parole,
104097/2012, New York State Supreme Court, New York County
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;University of California Must Disclose Fund Investments Details &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of California, which manages a $70 billion
investment portfolio for retirees, faces a tentative court order
to make &#8220;a good faith effort&#8221; to get and disclose the returns
it earns from Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins Caufield 
Byers funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State court Judge Evelio Grillo in Oakland, California,
said in a tentative ruling that information about the
university&#8217;s commitment to the funds, cash invested, current net
asset values and returns for individual investment vehicles with
Kleiner and Sequoia, as well as communications with the private
equity firms, aren&#8217;t exempt from disclosure under state laws
passed in 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grillo rejected the university regents&#8217; argument in a
public records lawsuit that the information should remain
secret. The 26-member board of regents governs the university. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling came in a public records lawsuit against the
university filed by Reuters America LLC, a unit of Thomson
Reuters Corp. (TRI) The news agency is a competitor of Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s appropriate to comment until he
issues his final ruling after considering the arguments
presented by the parties&#8221; at an Oct. 19 hearing, said Dianne
Klein, a spokeswoman for the University of California&#8217;s office
of the president, in an e-mail yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kleiner, based in Menlo Park, California, and Sequoia
aren&#8217;t named as defendants in the lawsuit. Andrew Kovacs, a
spokesman for Menlo Park-based Sequoia Capital Operations LLC,
declined to comment on the ruling. There was no immediate
response to an e-mail to Kleiner&#8217;s media office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Reuters v. Regents, RG12-613664, Alameda County
Superior Court (Oakland, California). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Speeches and Interviews &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU Banks Need &#8216;TARP-Like&#8217; Program, Millstein and Studzinski Say &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European banks, battered by the sovereign-debt crisis and
tougher regulation, need a &#8220;TARP-like&#8221; program to help boost
market confidence and lending, Jim Millstein and John Studzinski
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ultimately, they need a central authority providing
equity behind the banking system&#8217;s liabilities,&#8221; Millstein, the
former U.S. Treasury Department chief restructuring officer who
started the turnaround advisory firm Millstein  Co., said in a
panel discussion at Bloomberg&#8217;s Dealmakers Summit in New York
yesterday. &#8220;The large European banks are actually more
leveraged than our banks were at the beginning of the crisis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TARP is the Treasury Department&#8217;s Troubled Asset Relief
Program, a $700 billion bank-bailout fund that provided capital
injections to firms including Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America
Corp. during the financial crisis. European banks are struggling
to fulfill a pledge made last year to cut more than $1.2
trillion of assets to help them weather the sovereign-debt
crisis, stoking investor concern about financial stability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The traditional model in Europe for the banking system is
bust,&#8221; said Studzinski, senior managing director and global
head of Blackstone Advisory Partners LP, citing the dependency
of companies on banks as well as the structure of large banks
and local state-owned lenders. He also called for a TARP-like
program for the region&#8217;s banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You need some sort of pan-European deposit guarantee
system&#8221; to slow down the flight of capital, said billionaire
investor Wilbur Ross, speaking at the same event. He called it a
&#8220;conceptual error&#8221; to try to impose new Basel III regulations
while simultaneously asking banks to lend more. &#8220;It&#8217;s not going
to work.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belgian authorities are
investigating the killing of an Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) executive in
Brussels earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicholas Mockford, a British national, was killed on Oct.
14 in the Belgian capital, Sophie Foale, a spokeswoman for the
company, said in an e-mailed statement. Mockford was a
department manager at Exxon&#8217;s office near Brussels, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have no indication that the incident was work
related,&#8221; Foale said. Exxon is &#8220;shocked by the tragic death of
Nick Mockford.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mockford was shot three times after he was attacked by two
people when he left an Italian restaurant in the north of the
city and died on his way to the hospital, Belga newswire 
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genevieve Seressia, a spokeswoman for the Brussels
prosecutor&#8217;s office, declined to give details on the case,
citing instructions from the investigating judge, Martine
Quintin. She said investigators were calling for witnesses to
come forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We hope that we will find the perpetrators,&#8221; Seressia
said in a telephone interview today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) surrounded
its headquarters with sandbags, and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) closed
flood-prone offices as water driven by Hurricane Sandy lapped
into Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks shifted duties to other cities and had some New York-
based employees working at home as exchanges closed so financial
industry employees wouldn&#8217;t risk their lives amid the largest
Atlantic tropical storm system recorded. Sandy forced the halt
of subways and the interruption of electricity, and U.S. stock
trading was canceled yesterday and today, the first time weather
caused consecutive days of shutdowns for exchanges since 1888. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Predictions of an 11-foot storm surge prompted Goldman
Sachs to stack sandbags around its West Street office in Lower
Manhattan, home to some of the world&#8217;s largest financial firms,
as the city ordered downtown neighborhoods evacuated. Partial
shutdowns included offices of the nation&#8217;s three biggest banks,
JPMorgan, Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. (C) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We operate in 60 countries and have these types of events
happen outside the U.S. more commonly than they do in places
like New York,&#8221; said JPMorgan co-Chief Operating Officer Frank Bisignano in a Bloomberg Television interview with Erik Schatzker and Stephanie Ruhle. &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen tsunamis in Asia,
we&#8217;ve seen floods in India and managed through volcanoes in
Chile. Until the event occurs, you really don&#8217;t know the impact
on your business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed-income trading at Goldman Sachs was mostly limited to
money markets and ensuring clients had funding they needed to
meet obligations that are coming due, said a person familiar
with the bank, who declined to be identified because the
information is private. Plans may be the same today, according
to the person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Power Cut &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is counting on employees in locations
including London and Salt Lake City, with the West Street office
scheduled to be closed today, according to a memo from Chief
Administrative Officer Jeffrey Schroeder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consolidated Edison Inc., New York City&#8217;s utility, said
late yesterday it was cutting power to parts of lower Manhattan
as flood waters threatened underground electrical systems. The
cuts affected more than 5,000 customers, the utility said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, closed all buildings and
branches in New York&#8217;s Zone A, the mandatory evacuation area,
the four main heads of retail and mortgage operations said in an
e-mail to the bank&#8217;s 160,000 retail employees. Bisignano said in
the interview the New York-based company has about 35,000 people
who may be affected by the storm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Very Light&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some trading still occurred, &#8220;it was a very light
day, I mean very, very light,&#8221; Bisignano said. &#8220;Even though
there&#8217;s fabulous remote ability by every company in this
industry, including by our clients, you saw most people focused
on safety at home.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 20,000 of Morgan Stanley (MS)&#8217;s employees used remote
connections to work from home, according to a staff memo from
Jim Rosenthal, chief operating officer of the New York-based
investment bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup&#8217;s main U.S.-based trading office at 388-390
Greenwich Ave. is included in New York&#8217;s mandatory evacuation
order, as are some branches and an office at 111 Wall St.,
according to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, the second-biggest U.S. lender by assets,
said it closed its offices at Two and Four World Financial
Center as well as all of its New York City branches and Merrill
Lynch wealth-management offices in New York and the mid-Atlantic
markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Express Co. (AXP), the credit-card lender with
headquarters in Lower Manhattan, will shut all its offices in
the tri-state region today, the second straight day of closures,
a spokeswoman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;European Banks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European-based firms including Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Credit
Suisse, UBS AG (UBSN) and BNP Paribas SA (BNP), which have offices outside of
the mandatory evacuation zone, made arrangements to provide
transportation and hotels for workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS booked hotels for staff in Manhattan, Stamford,
Connecticut, and Weehawken, New Jersey, according to Karina Byrne, a spokeswoman at the Zurich-based bank. Paris-based BNP

&lt;p&gt;The alarm sounds at 7 a.m., and this
is during vacation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not your typical time off, though. I have an hour to wash,
eat breakfast and get outside to meet the farm manager. I am in
San Miniato, Italy, working the grape harvest at the Tuscany
estate of Cosimo Maria Masini. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For two weeks I trade my Christian Louboutin heels for
boots and my computer keyboard for gardening gloves and
clippers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cosimo Maria Masini is a certified organic and biodynamic
farm. It uses no synthesized chemicals and limited mechanical
intervention in the winemaking process. The concept is based on
principles derived from Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner, who
is credited as the founder of biodynamics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An organization called World Wide Opportunities on Organic
Farms, or Wwoof, allows me to work like a dog picking the grapes
that will become the 2012 vintage. The organization matches
volunteer workers with organic farms in order to share
sustainable ways of living. More than 50 countries offer Wwoof
opportunities such as working on a coffee plantation in Hawaii
or landscaping in New Zealand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I volunteered. Yet nonfinancial rewards come in the
form of San Miniato sunsets, sweet figs and ripe tomatoes from
the orchards lining the property, and the camaraderie of people
from diverse backgrounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#8217;s a chef from Japan, two post-collegiate women from
Iowa, an architecture student from France and an entrepreneur
from Brooklyn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goldman, BlackRock &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helen Belogolova, a former trader at Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) for three years and who also worked at BlackRock Inc. (BLK) for a
year as a portfolio manager, now is pursuing a Ph.D. at the UCLA
Anderson School of Management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She seems less interested in winemaking and more in
spending a few weeks in the beautiful countryside. By contrast,
Andrea Bandini, 23, an aspiring winemaker from San Miniato, is
working at the farm as part of his internship for the trade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s obligatory for the program,&#8221; he says about his
university studies specializing in viticulture and oenology.
&#8220;I&#8217;d like to make wine one day in Tuscany.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthony Vecci, a 25-year-old American who arrived as a
Wwoofer at the farm last October, is now a full-time employee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I came looking for export jobs, but it&#8217;s a difficult
industry in Italy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Despite experience, you start at
the bottom rung and are paid very little and have very little
responsibility.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Working Vacation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About one in 10 people are actually interested in wine when
they arrive, Vecci said. &#8220;Most see the pictures on the website
and think of the stereotypical Tuscan setting and see a
beautiful way to vacation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call it a working vacation. While I&#8217;m in the minority who
are there to experience winemaking, the picturesque backdrop is
not lost on me. Nor are the myriad mosquitos that laugh at the
long pants and sleeves I wear in soaring temperatures to avoid
getting scratched by the thousands of little prickles clinging
to my clothes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start early to avoid the heat, which this year has been
historically high. The sun beats down at as much as 40 degrees
Celsius (110 degrees Fahrenheit). Our jugs of cold water are
tepid by mid-morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Grape Stomping &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical day is spent crouched among the dense vines,
clipping ripe bunches to fill hundreds of crates that are
brought back to the cantina where the winemaking occurs.
Stomping grapes with bare feet is still practiced here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the rolling hills of Tuscany are beautiful, they&#8217;re a
hard terrain to work on. Maneuvering with 25-pound (12-kilo)
crates in the vineyard is more science than art. Back at the
cantina, the grapes are manually dropped into a machine that
separates stems from fruit, which is then dumped into the
fermentation barrels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;m surprised by the weight of the grapes as I plunge my
bare arm into the barrel. I&#8217;m more surprised by how hot it is at
the bottom -- a sign that fermentation is taking place. The pre-
fermenting juice tastes as sweet as sugar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sweet aroma of alcohol wafts through the cantina. The
floor is sticky from juice that has splashed out, all of which
means more insects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Espresso Rush &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We work until about noon and break for lunch, which is
washed down with espresso to give us energy to get through the
rest of the workday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The red varietals are turned, or punched down, by hand a
few times a day, typically by men. I tried it, standing on the
narrow edge of the barrel and using all my weight to push down
the grapes with a long, shovel-like metal tool while praying
that I wouldn&#8217;t fall in. Another worker was not so fortunate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some days there&#8217;s labeling and packing of boxes of wine
that will be shipped for export or sold locally to shops and
restaurants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#8217;s no maid service. Preparing meals and chores are
divided among the workers. Leisure time is spent playing cards,
napping or trying to access e-mail or Skype over the spotty
Internet connection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dinners most nights last for hours and include beer and
wine. They are followed by dancing. Weekends are free and often
involve trips to nearby destinations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hard Lessons &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;ve never worked so hard on vacation -- nor learned so
much. Handpicking allows for more selectivity, so only the
healthiest grapes are used, and white varietals are often picked
first because red grapes take longer to reach full maturation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wasn&#8217;t true of the malvasia grapes, a local white
variety that becomes Fedardo, Cosimo Maria Masini&#8217;s name for the
sweet Italian dessert wine known as Vin Santo. After picking,
the grapes hang to dry for three to four months until ready to
be pressed and aged in small barrels for five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps that&#8217;s the only drawback of the experience: having
to wait to taste the fruits of my labor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Miniato is about 45 minutes by train from Florence. It
is the center of a white truffle zone and hosts an annual
festival in November. The Wwoof website provides a list of
participating farms. Membership is 25 euros ($32.30) and covers
medical insurance while working. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) unveiled a new version of its software for smartphones today, redoubling an effort to regain market share lost to Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;New features include a new Pandora Media Inc. (P) app with a year of advertising-free Internet radio, a program that helps customers use less of their wireless data capacity and an app that lets parents control what programs and features their children can use, Microsoft Vice President Joe Belfiore said today at an event in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Windows Phone 8 software, running on devices with better screens and more powerful chips, will rely for the first time on the same underlying programming code as the flagship Windows operating system. Microsoft, with just 3.5 percent share of the smartphone market in the second quarter, seeks to close a gap with Apple&#8217;s more popular iOS and devices from Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) and other makers that use Google&#8217;s Android. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The platform looks very competitive,&#8221; Al Hilwa, an analyst at research firm IDC, said of Microsoft&#8217;s new lineup. Hardware will be &#8220;on par with iOS and Android devices&#8221; in terms of power, screen resolution, camera and data speeds, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related Stories:&lt;/p&gt;

Google With Korean Partners Unveils Devices
&lt;p&gt;Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)&#8217;s Lumia 920, featuring a 4.5-inch (11-centimeter) screen and an 8.7-megapixel camera, will run on Windows Phone 8. HTC Corp. (2498) will sell two devices -- the Windows Phone 8X and the 8S -- which sport a new design, better audio and a wide-angle camera. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Carrier Push &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said the new phones go on sale in Europe this weekend and in the U.S. in November at ATT Inc. (T), Verizon Wireless and T-Mobile USA stores, as well as Microsoft&#8217;s own retail outlets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aside from improving phone hardware and adding features to the software, Microsoft&#8217;s biggest challenge lies in how to market its mobile products, particularly in the stores of U.S. carriers where salespeople often recommend iPhones and Android devices. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Carriers and handset makers have been providing sales staff with their own Windows Phones in an effort to get them excited about the products, said Thom Gruhler, a vice president recruited in March from McCann Worldgroup to improve the Windows Phone&#8217;s marketing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to say we&#8217;ve got it all solved, but the important thing for us is there&#8217;s excitement among retail sales personnel,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This isn&#8217;t a panacea. It&#8217;s going to improve this holiday and improve the next holiday and the next after that. It takes time and attention from us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Marketing Pitch &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft will also back the effort with its biggest advertising campaign ever for Windows Phone, he said. The campaign, which will begin in the coming weeks, will focus on the product and how users can personalize phones, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gruhler also noted that Verizon, which had previously sold only one Windows Phone model in the two years the devices have been on the market, is showing a new level of commitment by selling three different models this holiday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Helping to boost Microsoft&#8217;s case with consumers, Windows Phone now has 120,000 apps, including 46 of the top 50 on rival phones, Microsoft&#8217;s Belfiore said. Pandora, for example, had been a long-time holdout. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are more than 700,000 apps on Apple&#8217;s store, including more than 275,000 specifically for the iPad tablet computer. There are about 700,000 apps for Android devices, Google said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Apple&#8217;s Popularity &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Operating on phones with a dual-core chip and high- definition screens, Windows 8 supports near-field communication technology, which lets customers use phones to make payments. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft initially discussed some of the features in June. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new Windows Phone 8-based devices are aimed squarely at Apple&#8217;s iPhones, which have a market share of 17 percent, as well as smartphones based on Google&#8217;s Android software, which accounted for 68 percent of the market, according to Framingham, Massachusetts-based IDC. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The iPhone 5 sold 5 million units in its debut weekend, or about the same number of Windows Phone devices shipped in the entire second quarter, based on IDC&#8217;s data. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Consumers heading into the U.S. year-end holiday shopping season are being offered a bounty of choices. Apple began selling the iPhone 5 last month with a bigger screen, lightweight body design and faster processor, and Google today unveiled new versions of its Nexus smartphone and tablet, which showcase Android&#8217;s latest features. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Mobile Shift &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Windows Phone software has declined in annual market share for the past three years, according to IDC data compiled by Bloomberg Industries, even in 2010 when it was revamped. There is some growth, with second quarter market share climbing from 2.3 percent a year earlier, according to IDC. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, Microsoft as a whole is grappling with the shift to mobile computing, with first fiscal quarter profit and sales missing analysts&#8217; estimates. For the first time in a decade, the total PC market will contract this year, by 1.2 percent to 348.7 million units, according to IHS ISuppli. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which is revamping its software across the board, introduced Windows 8, a new version of its software for PCs, last week. With the suite of new software, the company is aiming to push Windows, which dominated the market over the past two decades by running on nine out of every 10 personal computers, into mobile computing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares advanced 1.2 percent to close at $28.21 in New York on Oct. 26, and are up 8.7 percent so far this year. Trading was canceled today due to a hurricane on the East Coast. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Dina Bass in Seattle at  dbass2@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Tom Giles at  tgiles5@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alleged data rigging by
Argentina that cost inflation-linked bondholders $7 billion and
earned the nation a rebuke from the International Monetary Fund
is now turning MetLife Inc. against its banker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The local unit of the largest U.S. life insurer is suing
JPMorgan Chase  Co. to recoup $107 million in losses on notes
securitized by the lender, claiming the biggest U.S. bank by
assets used government inflation data that is estimated to be
less than half the actual rate to value the debt. The underlying
bonds lost 9.5 percent in dollars this year, the biggest drop
among inflation-linked debt in Latin America, after plunging 25
percent in 2011, according to Barclays Plc. Economists estimate
inflation at 24 percent, versus the official rate of 9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed in London, is emblematic of the mistrust
Argentina has sowed since it fired statisticians in 2007 and
began reporting consumer prices that economists say are
inaccurate. That&#8217;s shut the nation out of its own bond market
and caused trading in notes tied to consumer prices to dry up.
Unable to sell debt overseas since its record default in 2001,
Argentina has also imposed currency controls and seized oil
producer YPF SA in the past year as it faces borrowing costs
that are twice the average in emerging markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflation-linked bonds have &#8220;fallen off the map,&#8221;
Leonardo Chialva, a partner at Delphos Investment in Buenos
Aires, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;They barely trade among
a reduced, highly speculative group of investors who are not
looking at the fundamentals because they depend on the highly
subjective and arbitrary component that is official inflation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Good Faith&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for JPMorgan and MetLife declined to comment
about ongoing litigation. Officials at Argentina&#8217;s Economy
Ministry didn&#8217;t return calls seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metropolitan Life Seguros de Retiro SA alleges that by
using the government&#8217;s data, JPMorgan paid less interest on
securities that were created by the bank and tied to the
performance of underlying Argentine bonds, according to court
documents filed in September and made available last week.
JPMorgan put the redemption value of the notes at $177 million,
a figure based on official inflation, while MetLife said their
value should have been $284 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Argentine unit of the New York-based insurer says a
clause in the bond contract stipulates that JPMorgan was
required to determine consumer prices &#8220;in good faith and in a
commercially reasonable manner based in available market
information,&#8221; in the event the country&#8217;s official data was
deemed unreliable. Instead, New York-based JPMorgan used
official inflation that one of its analysts deemed &#8220;grossly
distorted,&#8221; MetLife said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.S. Ruling &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has said
since taking office in December 2007 that her government&#8217;s data
is accurate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate case, Argentina lost a bid to reverse U.S.
court rulings on Oct. 26 that may help creditors including
billionaire Paul Singer&#8217;s hedge fund Elliott Management Corp.
collect $1.4 billion on defaulted debt, sparking the biggest
decline in the country&#8217;s bonds in four months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government&#8217;s dollar-denominated notes due in 2015 fell
4.98 cents to 84.55 cents on the dollar, pushing yields to an
almost three-month high 13.82 percent, after the U.S. Appeals
Court in New York ruled that Argentina can&#8217;t discriminate
against holders of the defaulted bonds in favor of those that
own the securities it restructured following the default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Elliot Management this month won a court
order in Ghana to seize an Argentine navy frigate when it docked
in the West African nation on a training mission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Captive Buyers&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nation&#8217;s foreign-exchange restrictions, which Fernandez
imposed after her re-election in October 2011, have also
undermined trading in inflation-linked bonds, according to
Bulltick Capital Markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the unregulated market, which traders use to acquire
dollars by buying assets locally in pesos and selling them
abroad in U.S. currency, the peso has weakened 27 percent this
year to 6.5252 pesos per dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Basically, everybody bailed on that trade,&#8221; Alberto Bernal, head of fixed-income research at Bulltick, said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;Local trading is mostly arbitrage by
captive buyers at this point.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argentina&#8217;s credit-rating outlook last month was revised to
negative from stable by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, which said
misreporting inflation data has resulted in the underpayment of
holders of inflation-linked bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Moody&#8217;s Downgrades &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combined with the $8.9 billion still owed to the Paris Club
of creditor nations, the underpayment demonstrates a lack of
willingness to pay back creditors, according to Moody&#8217;s. The
country is rated B3, six levels below investment grade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s lowered the foreign debt ratings of three Argentine
banks from B2 to B3 on Oct. 26, citing the risk that debtors
will be unable to access foreign currency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South America&#8217;s second-biggest economy is on track to be
the first country censured by the IMF for not sharing accurate
inflation data. The IMF&#8217;s board of directors gave Argentina
until Dec. 17 to respond to its concerns. After that, the board
can issue a declaration of censure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enrique Alvarez, the New York-based head of Latin America
fixed-income research at IdeaGlobal, says the threat of a
downgrade and censure by IMF won&#8217;t compel the Argentine
government to change its inflation data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Argentina is not going to fully budge,&#8221; he said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;You see that in their actions. I don&#8217;t
believe that they&#8217;ll make an immediate U-turn and start
reporting something that would cost them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Blow Up&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, Fernandez fined economists for reporting
independent inflation estimates, prompting opposition lawmakers
to compile the reports and publish them anonymously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September, she questioned whether U.S. inflation was
close to 2 percent and told a Georgetown University student in a
televised conference that &#8220;if inflation in Argentina was 25
percent, the country would blow up.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield, or spread, investors demand to hold
Argentine government dollar bonds instead of Treasuries swelled
six basis points to 993 at 12:32 p.m. in Buenos Aires, according
to JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of protecting Argentine debt against non-payment
for five years with credit-default swaps surged 246 basis points
to 1,533, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The swaps pay the
buyer face value in exchange for the underlying securities or
cash if a government or company fails to comply with debt
agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peso was little changed at 4.7537 per dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edwin Gutierrez, who helps manage $9 billion of emerging-
market debt at Aberdeen Asset Management Plc and owned Argentine
inflation-linked bonds in the past, says MetLife may be locked
in a legal battle with JPMorgan for years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This will be a long, drawn-out battle,&#8221; Gutierrez said
in a telephone interview from London. &#8220;Good luck with that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s Indonesian unit, the
nation&#8217;s largest producer of crude, started a $500 million
expansion of the project at Duri field in Sumatra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At peak production, the site at North Duri Development Area
13 is forecast to add 17,000 barrels a day to production, PT
Chevron Pacific Indonesia said in an e-mailed statement today. A
Chevron spokesman in Singapore confirmed the news. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The North Duri 13 project will add 539 new wells, including
145 using a technology known as steam injection to increase
production yields, the company said. Steam flooding involves
injecting steam into wells to ease the flow of heavy oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project follows an expansion in Area 12 that was
completed in 2009, adding 40,000 barrels a day to production, it
said. The Duri field is one of the world&#8217;s largest steam-flood
projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Pacific may produce 343,212 barrels of oil a day
this year, about 39 percent of Indonesia&#8217;s total output,
according to data from the nation&#8217;s oil and gas regulator,
BPMigas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia is trying to stem production decline as older
fields pump less crude. The nation withdrew from the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in 2008 amid
falling output. &lt;/p&gt;

Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s daughter Elisabeth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International investors including
Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) are favoring natural gas over oil sands
acquisitions in Canada as the less-expensive way to supply Asian
markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three of the five largest energy acquisitions announced by
foreign buyers in Canada this year, valued at a combined $9.8
billion, were for natural gas assets, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The trend will continue next year as liquefied
natural gas developers move closer to commissioning projects,
said Robert Mark, who helps oversee C$4.5 billion ($4.5 billion)
at MacDougall, MacDougall  MacTier Inc. in Montreal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a unique scramble in Canada to lock up gas assets
for LNG,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Asian buyers look at that as a significant
opportunity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A race to secure natural gas for planned LNG export on
Canada&#8217;s West Coast by Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Exxon and others
has spurred interest in the fossil fuel among investors seeking
to benefit from the price differences between Asia and North
America. With at least five LNG projects valued at as much as
$15 billion each proposed for British Columbia&#8217;s northwest
coast, proponents are lining up supplies from reserves such as
the Horn River and the Montney shale formations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Record Premium &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canadian natural gas traded yesterday at C$3.175 per
gigajoule, after more than doubling from a 10-year low of
C$1.4475 on April 20. That compares with about $16 for LNG
contracts sold in Japan. A gigajoule is a unit of energy. About
100 gigajoules of natural gas is required to heat a single
family home in Canada for one year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign buyers of natural gas producers or assets this year
include Tokyo-based Mitsubishi Corp. (8058), Japan&#8217;s largest trading
company; Irving, Texas-based Exxon; and Petroliam Nasional Bhd,
Malayasia&#8217;s state-owned oil and gas company. The premiums paid
for those assets have reached as high as 97 percent, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petroliam Nasional, known as Petronas and based in Kuala
Lumpur, boosted its first offer for Progress Energy Resources
Corp. (PRQ) to C$22, or 97 percent more than the Calgary-based
company&#8217;s 20-day average before the initial proposal, the
steepest premium on record in the oil and gas industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petronas yesterday extended its C$5.16 billion offer for
Progress after an initial regulatory rejection by the Canadian
government on Oct. 19. Progress rose 0.4 percent to C$19.89 at
4:19 p.m. today after soaring 8 percent yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deals Increasing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the world&#8217;s largest energy company by market value,
agreed to pay C$2.86 billion for Calgary-based Celtic
Exploration Ltd.&#8217;s leases in Alberta&#8217;s gas-producing Duvernay
and Montney formations on Oct. 17, its biggest Canadian
acquisition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada&#8217;s decision on Petronas&#8217;s bid will determine how many
more foreign investors are lured to Canada, said John Stephenson, who helps manage C$2.7 billion at First Asset
Investment Management Inc. in Toronto. He owns shares of natural
gas producers including Painted Pony Petroleum Ltd. (PPY) and Crew
Energy Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It remains to be seen how many of these deals get done,&#8221;
he said in a phone interview. &#8220;Up until this point, natural gas
deals have been on the upswing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Producers with holdings in the Montney formation in
northeastern British Columbia, could see bids for assets or
entire companies as LNG proponents secure gas reserves, said
Gordon Currie, analyst at Salman Partners Inc. in Calgary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You need to have a lot of reserves tied up to support an
LNG export facility so it&#8217;s entirely possible they would be out
looking to tie up additional resources,&#8221; Currie said in a phone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Possible Targets &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targets could include Painted Pony, Talisman Energy Inc. (TLM),
Advantage Oil  Gas Ltd. (AAV), and ARC Resources Ltd. (ARX), Currie said.
Shares of these gas producers, all based in Calgary, have
declined this year through yesterday, with Painted Pony down 5.3
percent; Talisman, 7.2 percent; Advantage, 18 percent; and ARC
Resources, 3.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick Ward, Painted Pony&#8217;s chief executive officer, was
not immediately available to comment yesterday when contacted by
phone by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon looks for &#8220;value&#8221; for its shareholders, Alan Jeffers, a company spokesman said in a phone interview,
yesterday. The company is in the &#8220;very early stages&#8221; of
evaluating an LNG terminal for western Canada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advantage is considering a strategic review after
announcing in August that it plans to sell &#8220;non-core&#8221; assets,
Doug Jackson, a company spokesman said in a phone interview
today. Phoebe Buckland, a spokeswoman for Talisman, did not
immediately respond to an e-mail request for comment. Niki
Anderson, a spokeswoman for ARC Resources, said the company had
&#8220;nothing to add&#8221; to its past position on market perceptions it
could be a target. The company is not interested in being taken
over or in pursuing joint ventures, David Carey, ARC Resources
vice president of capital markets, said in a Sept. 14 interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stranded Gas &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among companies seeking partners to develop gas reserves in
Canada are Encana Corp., which is marketing a stake in its
Duvernay shale acreage in Alberta and Cutbank Ridge acreage in
British Columbia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building infrastructure to allow &#8220;stranded&#8221; gas reserves
to reach new markets makes those assets more attractive to
potential investors, said Tim Marchant, an adjunct professor of
energy strategy and geopolitics at the University of Calgary and
a former senior manager at BP Plc. (BP/) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TransCanada Corp. has agreed to develop a 700-kilometer
(434-mile) pipeline in British Columbia to link gas from the
Montney to an LNG project in Kitimat led by Shell. Spectra
Energy Corp. (SE), based in Houston Texas, has signed on with BG
Group Plc (BG/) to build a separate 850 kilometer line from the
Montney to BG&#8217;s proposed terminal in Prince Rupert.| &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oil Sands &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Any time you get a major trunk line built, a lot of
assets that may have been considered stranded, become attractive
because you can evacuate them,&#8221; Marchant said in a phone
interview. &#8220;Asian state-owned oil companies are planning in a
very holistic way for energy demand over the next few decades
and North American gas is cheap if you want to add reserves.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil sands projects will probably require C$23 billion this
year in investments, according to the Canadian Association of
Petroleum Producers. Foreign companies are holding off on oil
sands purchases, said Wenran Jiang, a University of Alberta
professor and adviser to the Alberta government on Asian
investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asian national energy companies and private investors are
eyeing Western Canadian natural gas reserves as well as
conventional oil deposits outside the oil sands to quench
current supply shortages, Jiang said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Oil sands are too big in scale, in terms of advanced
investment and the slow pace of return and scale of the
infrastructure building,&#8221; Jiang said in a telephone interview
from Edmonton on Oct. 26. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Canada Crude &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Price discounts for Canadian heavy crude, made from oil
sands bitumen, when compared to prices paid for Brent, the
international benchmark, are also working against oil sands
investments, said Mark of MacDougall, MacDougall  MacTier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As an international investor you look around the globe,
and you see that you&#8217;re getting paid in Brent, but with Canadian
heavy crudes, you&#8217;re getting a big discount,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If
you&#8217;re buying assets, you might be more inclined to buy gas or
conventional crude.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. energy companies ConocoPhillips (COP), Marathon Oil Corp.
and Murphy Oil Corp. said they are all considering divesting
oil-sands assets amid industry concerns about project cost
overruns and discounting of Canadian crude prices as export
pipeline capacity is squeezed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said it
will assess the risk of having two buildings in close proximity
after Hurricane Sandy caused flooding at offices in Manhattan
and across the Hudson River in Jersey City, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s one of the things we&#8217;ll talk about,&#8221; Gary Cohn, the
company&#8217;s president and chief operating officer, said today in
an interview on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;Market Makers&#8221;
program. &#8220;They&#8217;re very much in similar weather zones, so
clearly something to be thought of.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets and
the largest by equity-trading revenue, surrounded both buildings
with sandbags before the storm deluged lower Manhattan and parts
of New Jersey yesterday. The two office towers, both built
within the past decade, are a ferry ride across the river from
each other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Wall Street rivals, such as
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Morgan Stanley, have headquarters in
midtown Manhattan -- on higher ground that escaped flooding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve gone through all the protective measures we could
to isolate the buildings from each other,&#8221; including separate
electrical and communications systems, Cohn said, adding that
the firm likes the ease with which it can move employees between
the locations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has a total of 3.7 million square feet at its
New York headquarters at 200 West St., which was completed in
2009, and the tower at 30 Hudson St. in Jersey City, according
to an annual filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;London, Tokyo &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm has more than 1,600 people in Salt Lake City who
can handle some of the bank&#8217;s business if the New York and
Jersey City locations are shut down, Cohn said. Goldman Sachs
also can count on London, Hong Kong and Tokyo to assume some
responsibilities, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have a bunch of conference calls going on trying to
get people to where they need to be,&#8221; Cohn said, adding that
some employees are within walking distance of headquarters.
&#8220;Sales and trading personnel are the people that will be our
No. 1 priority to get into the building.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs also is weighing how to help the Battery Park
neighborhood surrounding its headquarters, including allowing
residents to use facilities at the Conrad Hotel adjacent to 200
West St. and owned by the bank, Cohn said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Executive
Officer Steve Ballmer said 4 million Windows 8 upgrades were
sold to consumers since the flagship operating system for
personal computers went on sale last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAP AG (SAP), Twitter Inc. and Dropbox Inc. are building
applications for Windows 8, Ballmer said at a conference for
developers at Microsoft&#8217;s headquarters in Redmond, Washington.
He said application developers would benefit from their
familiarity with older Windows versions and will be able to
write for mobile phones and tablets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest software maker began selling Windows 8
on Oct. 26. The operating system has been completely redesigned
to work with desktops, laptops and touch-screen tablets as
Microsoft competes with Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG) for the
loyalty of customers who are increasingly shunning PCs and
flocking to mobile devices. Attracting developers to write apps
for Windows will be crucial in capturing sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Windows 8 needs a great Twitter app,&#8221; Twitter said in a
short blog, which was confirmed by the company. &#8220;So we&#8217;re
building it. Looking forward to sharing it with you in the
months ahead.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downloadable applications have become central to the way
customers use tablet computers, and one of Apple&#8217;s selling
points is its leadership in apps. Google said yesterday it has
matched the 700,000 apps that Apple offers on its online store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co., ESPN and Lego A/S are also developing
applications for Windows 8, Microsoft said. The software maker
also showed how developers could set up payment systems in their
apps from either PayPal or Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) increased its stock repurchase fund by 75 percent to $11.7
billion and said it plans to ask the board to authorize more in
April as it seeks to improve shareholder returns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company may buy shares in the open market or in private
transactions, according to a statement today. Armonk, New York-
based IBM spent more than $3 billion on share repurchases in
each of the first two quarters of this year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty is using record
income this year from the company&#8217;s shift to more profitable
software and services to reward shareholders whose stock has
been outpaced by the broader market. While the Standard  Poor&#8217;s
500 index has increased at more than double the rate of IBM
shares this year, the company&#8217;s total return including dividends
and buybacks is 14 percent, compared with 16 percent for the SP
500. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM rose 0.9 percent to $193.27 on Oct. 26, the most recent
trading day. The stock market has been closed since yesterday
because of superstorm Sandy. The shares have climbed 5.1 percent
this year, compared with a 12 percent gain for the SP 500. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is projected to record net income of $17 billion this
year, up 7 percent from 2011, according to the average of
analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board also declared a quarterly dividend of 85 cents a
share to be paid Dec. 10, the company said. IBM last increased
its dividend in April. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guests on two Walt Disney Co. (DIS)
cruises reported being rocked as Hurricane Sandy traveled north
along the coast of Florida Oct. 26 and 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A video at CNN.com showed broken glass, gift shop
merchandise on the floor and a ship official warning passengers
to stay in their cabins as the Disney Fantasy was returning to
Port Canaveral, Florida, from a seven-day Caribbean cruise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Disney Dream, passengers who booked a three-day
Bahamas trip instead spent their time coping with rough seas,
according to postings on Disneycruiselineblog.com, which isn&#8217;t
affiliated with the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The cruise on the Dream was horrible,&#8221; a passenger who
identified herself as Laurie Eshelman said on the blog. &#8220;Rather
than stay in the Gulf of Mexico where it would have been calm
and sunny we followed Hurricane Sandy in very rough, rainy seas
with winds up to 83 m.p.h. Passengers were vomiting in the
shops, stairways and theater. Disney you blew this one!&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angela Bliss, a spokeswoman for the Burbank, California-
based Disney, said in an e-mailed there were no reports of
injuries. Minor damage didn&#8217;t prevent the ships from embarking
again on their current itineraries, she said. Both ships are in
the Bahamas, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The passengers who were in the storm were offered 25
percent discounts on future bookings, according to Bliss. The
company and crews were monitoring weather conditions and in
touch with U.S. Coast Guard officials at the time, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Safety is our top priority,&#8221; Bliss said. &#8220;At Disney
Cruise Line, our captains and crew members are highly trained
and experienced in navigating through inclement weather.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney closed at $50.08 on Oct. 26, down 0.4 percent.
Markets were closed today because of the storm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ecuadorean plaintiffs will ask an
Argentine court to enforce a $19 billion award against Chevron
Corp. (CVX) in a lawsuit over pollution in the Amazon rain forest by
seizing the company&#8217;s local assets, a lawyer for the group said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An attachment order will be filed as soon as tomorrow in a
Commercial Court of Justice in Buenos Aires, Pablo Fajardo, the
Ecuadorean lawyer who represents the group, said today at a
press conference in Buenos Aires. The group will ask to seize
Chevron&#8217;s local Argentine unit, dividends, oil sales income and
the company&#8217;s bank accounts in Argentina, Enrique Bruchou, an
Argentine attorney with Bruchou, Fernandez, Madero  Lombardi,
said at the same press conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ecuadoreans blame Texaco Inc., which Chevron acquired
in 2001, for destroying the environment in the Lago Agrio
region, damaging living conditions of 30,000 inhabitants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, on Oct. 9 lost a
U.S. Supreme Court bid to block the judgment imposed by an
Ecuadorean court. The highest U.S. court let stand a federal
appeals court ruling against Chevron that the Ecuadoreans can&#8217;t
be barred from seeking to collect the award anywhere in the
world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Ecuador judgment is a product of bribery, fraud, and
it is illegitimate,&#8221; Chevron said today in an e-mailed
response. &#8220;The company does not believe that the Ecuador
judgment is enforceable in any court that observes the rule of
law.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shale Partnership &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ecuadorean group also plans to file an attachment order
asking a Colombian court to do the same as the Argentine court,
Bruchou said. Seizures may be expedited because of a treaty
between the Latin American nations, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another related lawsuit was filed by the Ecuadoreans in the
Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Toronto on May 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the fourth-largest producer of oil in Argentina,
signed a memorandum of understanding on Sept. 14 with YPF SA (YPF),
Argentina&#8217;s biggest energy company, to analyze a partnership to
jointly develop projects at the shale formation of Vaca Muerta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Any attachment of Chevron assets should not affect YPF
but any proceeds from the partnership belonging to Chevron will
become attachable,&#8221; Bruchou said. Alejandro Di Lazzaro, a YPF
spokesman in Buenos Aires, declined to comment in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ecuadorean group estimates Chevron&#8217;s assets in
Argentina at $2 billion, Bruchou said. The Argentine assets
include a minority ownership in local pipeline Oleoductos del
Valle SA. Chevron&#8217;s Colombian assets that may be attached
include natural gas sales, which represent about two-thirds of
the country&#8217;s production, Bruchou said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Canada Ltd. will have a hearing on the lawsuit Nov.
28 in the Ontario Superior Court, Alan Lenczner, an attorney for
the Ecuadoreans based in Toronto, said in a telephone interview
today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V), the world&#8217;s biggest
payments network, posted a fiscal fourth-quarter profit that
beat analysts&#8217; estimates as the company reversed $627 million in
previously recorded tax reserves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income for the three months ended Sept. 30 climbed 89
percent to $1.66 billion, or $2.47 a share, from $880 million,
or $1.27, a year earlier, the Foster City, California-based
company said today in a statement. Adjusted profit per share,
which excludes one-time items, was $1.54, beating the $1.50
average estimate of 34 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Adjusted
net income for the full year was $4.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer spending in the U.S., where Visa gets more than
half its revenue, rose more than forecast last month, a sign
that the biggest part of the economy was strengthening as the
quarter ended. It was Visa&#8217;s last full period under the
stewardship of Chief Executive Officer Joseph W. Saunders, 66,
who steps down after today and hands control to Charles Scharf,
the former head of retail banking at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Visa has a strong foundation for continued long-term
growth as technology-enabled change continues to shape our
global market,&#8221; Saunders said in the statement. &#8220;We see
extraordinary opportunity for growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Visa&#8217;s Outlook &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa said annual earnings-per-share growth would be in the
&#8220;high teens&#8221; in 2013, down from a 2012 forecast of &#8220;low
twenties&#8221; provided in July, according to the statement. The
company said client incentives could climb to 18.5 percent of
gross revenues in 2013, compared with an earlier top range of 18
percent. Capital expenditures may climb to $475 million, up from
an estimate of $400 million, Visa said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa rose 1.2 percent to $140.51 at 4:38 p.m. in New York
after the announcement. It has climbed 37 percent this year, the
sixth-best performance in the 70-company Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
Information Technology Index. MasterCard Inc. (MA) rose 1.8 percent
to $460.93. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is working to derive more than half of its
revenue from outside the U.S. by 2015, Saunders has said.
Scharf, 47, may attain that goal with the help of a long-term
global consumer shift to electronic payments from cash and
checks, particularly in emerging economies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saunders, who led Visa since its 2008 initial public
offering, will remain as executive chairman through March. He
navigated challenges to the firm&#8217;s business model, including new
U.S. rules on debit-card fees that eroded the company&#8217;s
dominance of that business as it lost market share to MasterCard
and other competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MasterCard Results &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MasterCard&#8217;s third-quarter profit climbed 7.7 percent to
$772 million, the Purchase, New York-based company said today in
a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa&#8217;s operating revenue rose 15 percent to $2.73 billion
from a year earlier, beating the $2.67 billion estimate of 31
analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa has repurchased stock and increased the dividend as
the company moves closer to resolving a seven-year legal battle
with merchants over credit-card &#8220;swipe&#8221; fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement of the proposed class-action lawsuit against
banks, MasterCard and Visa probably is worthy of preliminary
approval, U.S. District Judge John Gleeson in Brooklyn, New
York, said last week. Visa has said its share of the settlement
would be about $4.4 billion. MasterCard has said the accord
could cost the company $790 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Processed Transactions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MasterCard, ranked No. 2 globally by processed
transactions, risks losing its standing as the second-biggest
payments network in terms of total spending to Shanghai-based
China UnionPay Data Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UnionPay&#8217;s share of combined credit- and debit-card
purchase volume for the first half of 2012 rose to 25 percent
from 21 percent a year earlier, while MasterCard&#8217;s climbed to 22
percent from 21 percent, according to the Nilson Report, a
payments-industry newsletter. Visa&#8217;s share declined to 46
percent from 49 percent, while fourth-ranked American Express
Co. (AXP)&#8217;s fell to 7.2 percent from 7.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa, MasterCard and New York-based AmEx were among
companies to win partial support this year from World Trade
Organization judges in a U.S. claim that China unfairly
discriminates against foreign suppliers of electronic-payment
services by imposing requirements on them that aren&#8217;t applied to
domestic firms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Citigroup
Inc. (C), the largest and third-largest U.S. banks by assets, opened
about half their retail branches in New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut following the biggest Atlantic storm in history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost 60 percent of JPMorgan&#8217;s 3,200 cash machines and 70
percent of Citigroup&#8217;s 1,500 ATMs are working today, the New
York-based banks said. JPMorgan is waiving late fees and other
charges for customers in 10 states along the East Coast and the
District of Columbia through Nov. 1, the lender said in a
statement. Citigroup said it is waiving similar charges through
Nov. 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our employees have done simply heroic things to get more
than half of our branches open today,&#8221; said Ryan McInerney,
chief executive officer of Chase&#8217;s consumer bank. &#8220;We stand
ready to help our customers in any way we can,&#8221; including
charging mobile phones, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial markets were shut for two days, airports were
dark and government offices shuttered by a storm that killed at
least 50 people and disrupted millions of lives because of
flooding and power failures. JPMorgan opened 587 branches, or 55
percent of its retail locations in the region. About 55 percent
of Citigroup&#8217;s 300 branches in the area are open, said Catherine Pulley, a spokeswoman for the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the second biggest U.S. lender, said
it was deploying mobile ATMs to serve customers in lower
Manhattan and that it had 13 banking centers open in the
borough. About 75 percent of its branches were open in the
Northeast, according to Mark Pipitone, a spokesman for the
Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup said it is refunding fees for customers who need
to use ATMs outside the bank&#8217;s network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We realize it&#8217;s important during this time to have easy
access to cash,&#8221; said Cece Stewart, president of U.S. consumer
and commercial banking for Citigroup. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) sued the
executive responsible for supervising Bruno Iksil, the trader
nicknamed the London Whale for market-moving wagers at the
division responsible for a $6.2 billion trading loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Javier Martin-Artajo, Iksil&#8217;s boss in the chief investment
office, is a defendant in a London lawsuit filed Oct. 22 by the
bank and made public today. The court filings didn&#8217;t reveal any
details of the complaint. Both men have left the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan disclosed trading losses in May after what Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said were &#8220;egregious&#8221; failures
to manage flawed positions on synthetic credit securities. The
bank is still recovering from those bets, the losses on which
had risen to $6.2 billion through the first nine months of 2012
and may increase, the bank has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo hasn&#8217;t been served with the lawsuit and
hasn&#8217;t seen the bank&#8217;s evidence against him, according to his
lawyer Greg Campbell. His client is &#8220;deeply disappointed by the
bank&#8217;s unjustified assertion that he may have attempted to
conceal the losses,&#8221; and is confident he&#8217;ll be cleared of any
wrongdoing, Campbell said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan ousted managers responsible for the group&#8217;s loss
and said it would claw back their pay after an internal probe
found traders may have intentionally tried to hide the problem.
The company didn&#8217;t name the managers. Iksil, Martin-Artajo and
former Europe CIO head Achilles Macris were responsible for
overseeing the trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kate Haywood, a spokeswoman for the New York-based bank,
declined to comment on the litigation by e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pricing Trades &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internal investigation by JPMorgan found that Martin-
Artajo encouraged Iksil to put higher values on his trades than
they would have fetched on the open market, the Wall Street
Journal reported in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is facing regulatory scrutiny and criminal probes
over the CIO group&#8217;s trading as well as U.S. lawsuits from
pension funds claiming they lost as much as $52 million because
of its activities. The unit was pushed by Dimon to make bigger
and riskier bets with the bank&#8217;s money in the years leading up
to the losses, according to former employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The botched bets spawned management changes and dismissals,
beginning with Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew, who retired
four days after the loss was disclosed on May 10. Barry Zubrow,
who had overseen JPMorgan&#8217;s risk management function during the
period, will retire at the end of this year, he said Oct. 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is: JP Morgan Chase  Co v. Mr Javier Martin-
Artajo, High Court of Justice, Queen&#8217;s Bench Division,
HQ12X04391 &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Jim Brunsden and Michael J. Moore" date="Nov 01, 2012 10:41 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-01/deutsche-bank-jpmorgan-may-face-top-g-20-capital-charges.html"><headline>Deutsche Bank Faces Top Surcharge as FSB Shuffles Tiers</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) would be required to
hold more capital and Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s burden stands to
be reduced as global regulators shuffled the competitive balance
among the world&#8217;s biggest banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C), HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
join Deutsche Bank as firms that will be targeted for a capital
surcharge of 2.5 percent, according to an updated list published
yesterday by the Financial Stability Board. The change means
Bank of America already exceeds requirements, while Deutsche
Bank would be more than 2 percentage points below the new
minimum of 9.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That limits earnings potential for Citigroup, JPMorgan
and Deutsche Bank compared to Bank of America, all other things
being equal, so it&#8217;s certainly a competitive advantage for
them,&#8221; said David Kass, a professor at the University of
Maryland&#8217;s Robert H. Smith School of Business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The capital surcharges for systemic banks, set in half-
percentage-point increments ranging from 1 percent to 2.5
percent, come on top of agreements by the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision to more than triple the core reserves they
must hold against possible losses. The extra requirements are
calculated against banks&#8217; interconnectedness, size, complexity,
global reach, and the ability of other firms to take over their
functions if they fail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;RBS, Dexia &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank of Scotland Plc will be subject to a 1.5 percent
buffer, down 1 percentage point from last year&#8217;s list. Three
banks -- Dexia SA (DEXB), Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) and Commerzbank AG -
- were removed from the list, the FSB said. Standard Chartered
Plc (STAN) and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA), which weren&#8217;t
included in 2011, were added to the lowest surcharge group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dexia is being broken up by the French and Belgian
governments after losing access to unsecured funding. The other
two have seen a &#8220;decline in their global systemic importance,&#8221;
the FSB said. The quality of data it used in determining the
list &#8220;improved considerably&#8221; from last year, the group said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It would have been more helpful if FSB explained why some
banks fell off the list and why some joined or moved around
buckets -- does this mean the framework was wrong last year?&#8221;
said Barbara Matthews, managing director of BCM International
Regulatory Analytics LLC, a Washington-based consulting firm.
&#8220;This is a classic case of informational asymmetry between
banks, regulators and markets that perpetuates moral hazard.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Capital Levels &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon last year
predicted a &#8220;race to the top&#8221; as lenders tried to meet
requirements well before the deadline and said his company would
win business because of its higher capital levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment banks that aren&#8217;t in the top group will have to
see if clients care whether they have as much capital as
Citigroup and JPMorgan, said Christopher Wheeler, a London-based
analyst at Mediobanca SpA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The guys at the top are stuck, and the guys below are
scratching their heads and saying, &#8216;Do we have to go up and be
in line to be competitive,&#8217;&#8221; Wheeler said. &#8220;If your clients
don&#8217;t worry, you&#8217;re probably fine&#8221; to hold lower equity
capital, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc (BARC) and BNP Paribas SA (BNP) may face surcharges of 2
percent. BNP, based in Paris, and Edinburgh-based RBS were
previously targeted for the highest 2.5 percent surcharges.
Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America, the second-
largest U.S. lender, now faces capital requirements a full point
lower than JPMorgan and Citigroup, the first- and third-biggest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Head-Scratcher&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Bank of America is a head-scratcher,&#8221; said Christopher Kotowski, an Oppenheimer  Co. analyst. &#8220;How you would come to
the conclusion that Bank of America is less of a SIFI and less
risky than JPMorgan and Citibank is just a real puzzler.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America said last month that it had an estimated
Basel III common equity ratio of 8.97 percent, above the 8.5
percent it would need with the surcharge in yesterday&#8217;s list.
Still, U.S. regulators may be cautious in letting the lender
return capital to shareholders in the form of dividends or
buybacks, Kotowski said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank said earlier this week that it plans to have
a Basel III ratio of 7.2 percent at the end of this year, below
the 9.5 percent it would need with a 2.5 percent surcharge. The
lender set a target of more than 10 percent by March 31, 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This ups the ante for Deutsche Bank,&#8221; Wheeler said.
&#8220;They haven&#8217;t been in a great hurry to get where they probably
need to be. We&#8217;ve been rattling on about how weak their capital
is.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deutsche Bank &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then-CEO Josef Ackermann said last year he was proud that
Germany&#8217;s biggest lender was considered the world&#8217;s most
systemically important financial institution by Japanese
regulators. Japan&#8217;s Financial Services Agency and central bank
ranked Deutsche Bank the most important among 60 peers based on
the impact their failure would have on the global financial
system, the Mainichi newspaper reported in December 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some banks in the European Union already face requirements
to hold core reserves equivalent to 9 percent of their risk-
weighted assets, after sovereign-debt writedowns, under plans
adopted by EU regulators in response to the bloc&#8217;s fiscal
crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9 Percent &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The definition of what banks can count as capital to meet
the international surcharges is stricter than that used by the
EU, which allows lenders to use some contingent convertible
instruments to meet the 9 percent threshold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard Chartered already exceeds the capital levels it
needs to meet the requirements, said Doris Fan, a Hong Kong-
based spokeswoman for the bank. &#8220;Our inclusion in the list does
not change the way we run the bank or think about our capital
structure,&#8221; she said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large international lenders would have faced a 374.1
billion-euro shortfall ($483.8 billion) in the capital needed to
meet the Basel capital rules had they been in force at the end
of 2011, according to data published by the Basel committee in
September. The figure factors in the surcharges for globally
systemic banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other changes included Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306),
which moved from 1 percent to 1.5 percent, pushing its total
requirement to 8.5 percent. Credit Agricole SA (ACA) moved down half a
point to 1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our global scale and activities probably prompted the
adjustment,&#8221; Yuji Okumura, a spokesman for Tokyo-based
Mitsubishi UFJ, Japan&#8217;s biggest publicly traded bank, said by
phone today. He said the lender already had an estimated Basel
III common equity ratio of at least 9 percent as of June 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Japan Megabanks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese Financial Services Minister Ikko Nakatsuka told
reporters he&#8217;s not concerned that Mitsubishi UFJ&#8217;s proposed
capital surcharge was raised. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group
Inc. (8316) and Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411), the country&#8217;s other two
so-called megabanks, remain on the list with targeted surcharges
of 1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The capital buffers are scheduled to be phased in beginning
Jan. 1, 2016, the FSB has said. The updated list was based on
banks&#8217; data at the end of 2011, the group said. The FSB said
last year regulators would update the list annually, with each
revision to be published in November. The 2014 version will be
the first to be applied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A lot of work remains to be done on determining what risk
weightings these banks will ultimately be subject to,&#8221; Richard Reid, research director for the International Centre for
Financial Regulation in London, said in an e-mail. It&#8217;s also
unclear how capital rules will &#8220;be applied in the coming
years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shrink Further &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators have said the list may shrink further as lenders
take steps to reduce their systemic importance and ensure they
can be wound down if they fail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There should come a day&#8221; when the list is blank, Stephen Cecchetti, head of the monetary and economic department at the
Bank for International Settlements, said in an October speech.
&#8220;That day will come when either the institutions change, the
rules change, or both.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSB published the updated list ahead of a meeting of
Group of 20 finance ministers starting Nov. 4. The FSB brings
together central bankers, regulators and government officials
from G-20 nations to coordinate financial rule-making. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others included on the list are Bank of New York Mellon
Corp., Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan
Stanley (MS), UBS AG (UBSN), Bank of China Ltd., Groupe BPCE, ING Groep NV (INGA),
Nordea Bank AB (NDA), Banco Santander SA (SAN), Societe Generale SA (GLE), State
Street Corp., Unicredit SpA (UCG), and Wells Fargo  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Citi&#8217;s estimated Tier 1 common ratio of 8.6 percent under
Basel 3 at the end of the third quarter is among the highest in
the industry,&#8221; said Shannon Bell, a spokeswoman for New York-
based Citigroup. &#8220;We expect to continue to generate capital
through earnings and divestitures of non-core assets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Dubrowski, a Bank of America spokesman, JPMorgan&#8217;s
Mark Kornblau and BNP&#8217;s Cesaltine Gregorio all declined to
comment on the FSB report. Duncan King, a spokesman for Deutsche
Bank, and Mary Guzman, a Credit Agricole spokeswoman in New
York, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to e-mailed requests for
comment, as did a spokesman for Lloyds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS), which agreed to its
biggest takeover in almost seven years, is betting $4.05 billion
that &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; is more valuable with Iron Man and Thor than
it was under George Lucas&#8217;s control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announced price for Lucasfilm Ltd. is larger than every
Disney purchase since Pixar in 2006, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. If the new &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; trilogy starting in 2015
matches the films released between 1999 and 2005, Disney is
adding the inflation-adjusted equivalent of three &#8220;Avengers,&#8221;
its 2012 movie that won about $1.5 billion in ticket sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney can squeeze more value out of the 35-year-old movie
series than any other entertainment company because of its
consumer-products business, which delivered $3 billion of sales
in 2011, and film-inspired amusement park rides, said Wunderlich
Securities Inc. The chance to boost sales outside the U.S. makes
the deal even more attractive for Disney shareholders than
Marvel Entertainment Inc., the 2010 purchase that yielded &#8220;The
Avengers,&#8221; the third-highest-grossing film of all time, Lazard
Capital Markets LLC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It will take some time to see the payoff here, but
Disney&#8217;s not managing their stock price for tomorrow or the next
day,&#8221; David Miller, a Los Angeles-based analyst at Caris  Co.,
said in a telephone interview. Though Disney shares retreated
1.9 percent following the deal&#8217;s announcement, &#8220;what the
Street&#8217;s missing here is the supplier power that Disney now has.
It makes sense strategically.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney shares rebounded today, rising 1.3 percent to
$49.78. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a value-creating acquisition,&#8221; Jay Rasulo, the
chief financial officer of Burbank, California-based Disney,
said in an Oct. 30 phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Joining Forces&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We fully expect that by joining forces with Disney,
Lucasfilm will succeed in ways far beyond anything the company
has ever experienced,&#8221; Lynne Hale, a spokeswoman for Lucasfilm,
wrote in an e-mail. &#8220;Disney affords us endless new
opportunities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucas, who is Lucasfilm&#8217;s only owner, will get half the
purchase price in cash and the rest in Disney stock, according
to an Oct. 30 statement, which also announced that a new &#8220;Star
Wars&#8221; trilogy will start coming out in 2015. While Lucasfilm
owns other assets such as the &#8220;Indiana Jones&#8221; movies, Disney
said it valued the deal almost entirely based on &#8220;Star Wars.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction furthers Disney Chief Executive Officer
Robert Iger&#8217;s pursuit of marquee content in an era marked by
technology changes, such as $8-a-month video streaming and free
game downloads, that disrupted Hollywood&#8217;s traditional revenue
sources. Iger, who paid a combined $11.2 billion for Pixar and
Marvel, said memorable characters will be valuable no matter
what medium they appear in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inflation, 3-D &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Technology has proved more friend than foe to great
storytelling,&#8221; Iger said in an Oct. 30 phone interview. &#8220;It
allows us to distribute in ways we never thought would have been
imaginable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If released today, the last three &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; films would
have each generated $1.5 billion on average when adjusting for
inflation, the expanded movie market outside the U.S. and
increased popularity of 3-D releases, Disney said. Sales of
related merchandise will total about $215 million this year, and
Lucasfilm earned $550 million in operating profit in 2005, when
the last movie, &#8220;Revenge of the Sith,&#8221; came out, Disney said
in its statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wunderlich&#8217;s Matthew Harrigan estimates that if Disney
earns $800 million for each new &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; film and $250
million in the years one isn&#8217;t released, Lucasfilm&#8217;s value is
$5.2 billion, or more than $1 billion greater than what Disney
is paying. Should the next movie only match Lucasfilm&#8217;s profit
in 2005 when &#8220;Revenge of the Sith&#8221; was released, the business
is worth $3.5 billion, he wrote in a note to clients yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Worth More &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The $5.2 billion number frankly could be low if they can
do the magic,&#8221; Denver-based Harrigan said in a phone interview.
&#8220;The $4 billion they&#8217;re paying is a pretty attractive price and
a lot of the &#8216;Star Wars&#8217; movies are going to be bigger than a
lot of the Marvel movies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evercore Partners Inc. says Lucasfilm&#8217;s peak earnings today
would be $600 million to $700 million, including royalty and
licensing profits. That implies Disney is paying 5.5 to 6 times
earnings, which is a &#8220;reasonable multiple,&#8221; Evercore analyst
Alan Gould said in a note to clients yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty full price,&#8221; Brett Harriss, an analyst
with Gabelli  Co. in Rye, New York, said in a phone interview.
&#8220;But if they can go out there and put out a successful third
trilogy of &#8216;Star Wars,&#8217; you could see this deal making sense.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Finding Nemo&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney agreed to buy animation studio Pixar, which created
&#8220;Toy Story&#8221; and &#8220;Finding Nemo,&#8221; in January 2006 and Marvel
in August 2009. Lucasfilm is the biggest deal since Pixar, based
on the size of the transactions when they were announced, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The Pixar purchase, initially valued
at $5.8 billion, increased to $7 billion by closing, and Marvel
expanded to $4.2 billion from $3.8 billion, the data show. The
figures fluctuated because both deals included stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger is reinventing Disney&#8217;s film business through
acquisitions of popular animated and live-action characters.
&#8220;Marvel&#8217;s The Avengers,&#8221; the first film from that acquisition
to be marketed by Disney, generated $1.51 billion in ticket
sales, trailing only &#8220;Titanic&#8221; and &#8220;Avatar,&#8221; according to
Box Office Mojo. The picture, Disney&#8217;s biggest ever, led to a 24
percent jump in profit in the quarter ended June 30. The
purchase also added characters such as Iron Man and Thor to the
company&#8217;s lineup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marvel and Pixar reinvigorated Disney&#8217;s film business, said
Martin Pyykkonen, an analyst at Wedge Partners Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;The Duds&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some of the best movies they&#8217;ve put out are Pixar and
Marvel, and more of the duds have come from their own home-grown
studio,&#8221; he said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, with its merchandising business, theme parks and
global presence, can revive and grow the &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; franchise
more easily than Lucasfilm could on its own, said Wunderlich&#8217;s
Harrigan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s consumer-products division, which includes movie-
branded apparel and toys for kids, drew $3.05 billion in revenue
last year, while the company&#8217;s parks and resorts accounted for
$11.8 billion, almost a third of total sales, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The top eight amusement parks worldwide by 2011
attendance belonged to Disney, according to an annual report
from the Themed Entertainment Association and consulting firm
Aecom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s no one else who could extract as much value from
&#8216;Star Wars&#8217; as Disney,&#8221; Harrigan said in a phone interview.
&#8220;On the merchandising side, Disney feels they can do a much
better job than Lucasfilm has done as a standalone.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Drawing Parallels &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While parallels can be drawn between Lucasfilm and Marvel,
the &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; owner &#8220;looks more promising&#8221; because of the
opportunity to boost non-U.S. revenue, Barton Crockett, a New
York-based analyst with Lazard Capital, wrote in a note to
clients yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each year, about a quarter of Disney&#8217;s sales are made
outside the U.S. and Canada, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Lucasfilm has sold its products abroad via distribution deals
with third-party agents, which can be cut out under Disney&#8217;s
ownership, said Evercore&#8217;s Gould, who&#8217;s based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There will be some cost savings by just taking out the
middle man,&#8221; Gould said in a phone interview. &#8220;Disney is
already in all those markets and licensing to the same
retailers. It should be very little incremental expense for
Disney to add the &#8216;Star Wars&#8217; line.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Retirement Plans &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Lucas will serve as a creative consultant for the new
movies, Iger said in a conference call with analysts that &#8220;it&#8217;s
his intent to retire.&#8221; Lucas, 68, said it was &#8220;time for me to
pass &#8216;Star Wars&#8217; on to a new generation of filmmakers,&#8221;
according to the Oct. 30 statement from Disney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kathleen Kennedy, co-chairman of Lucasfilm with its
founder, will become president of the unit. She co-founded
Amblin Entertainment with director Steven Spielberg and produced
&#8220;E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial&#8221; and &#8220;Jurassic Park.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prospect that fresh creative talent will reinvigorate
the franchise has fans excited, according to Paul Dergarabedian,
president of Hollywood.com Box-Office. While the movies released
in the late &#8217;70s and early &#8217;80s won acclaim, the second trilogy
fared worse. When averaging the scores for each movie, 90
percent of reviewers liked the original trilogy, compared with
68 percent for the second batch of films, according to data
compiled by RottenTomatoes.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next movie, known as &#8220;Episode 7,&#8221; is scheduled to
come out in 2015, the same year Iger is set to retire as CEO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a huge amount of hope and excitement surrounding
&#8216;Episode 7,&#8217; that it can kind of go back to what was created
with the first three films,&#8221; Dergarabedian said in a phone
interview. &#8220;Injecting new blood into the series with Lucas as
the visionary could prove to be very, very fruitful and
satisfying for the franchise.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s
largest energy company by market value, posted net income that
exceeded the highest estimate from analysts as its U.S.
refineries diminished the impact of lower oil output and prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third-quarter profit was $9.57 billion, or $2.09 a share,
down 7.1 percent from $10.3 billion, or $2.13, a year earlier,
Irving, Texas-based Exxon said in a statement today. The per-
share result topped the high estimate of $2.07 and was 13 cents
more than the $1.96 average of 19 analysts&#8217; estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s profit from refining oil at U.S. plants soared 78
percent to $1.4 billion, even as the benchmark margin based on
New York futures contracts dropped 5.2 percent. Oil and natural
gas production from Exxon&#8217;s wells fell to the lowest in three
years as output slipped everywhere the company operates except
for Africa and Australia, slashing so-called upstream profit by
29 percent to $5.97 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Their upstream performance was light relative to
expectations but that was offset somewhat by strength in their
U.S. refining operations,&#8221; Jason Gammel, an analyst at
Macquarie Capital Europe Ltd. in London, said in a telephone
interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Production Decline &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon probably will be forced to lower its full-year 2012
production target after output for the first nine months lagged
the year-earlier volumes by 6.2 percent, Brian Youngberg, an
analyst at Edwards Jones  Co. in St. Louis, said in an
interview today. The company said in March that full-year
production would be 3 percent lower than in 2011, or equivalent
to 4.37 million barrels a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon rose 0.5 percent to $91.60 at the close in New York.
Exxon has risen 8.1 percent this year. The shares have 13 buy
recommendations from analysts, 15 holds and zero sell ratings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales fell 7.7 percent to $115.7 billion, a smaller decline
than expected according to the average of three analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson
budgeted about $100 million a day this year to find oilfields,
build gas-export terminals and upgrade refineries and chemical
plants. The company agreed to almost $5 billion in acquisitions
in the past six weeks to reverse the longest stretch of
quarterly production declines in 13 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s production of oil and gas liquids such as butane
declined by 5.9 percent to 2.1 million barrels a day, led by
falling output from European wells, according to the statement.
More than 80 percent of Exxon&#8217;s oil and gas-liquids production
comes from outside the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Brent Down &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent oil futures, the benchmark for two-thirds of the
world&#8217;s crude, fell 2.4 percent during the quarter to an average
of $109.42 a barrel as global demand failed to keep pace with
growing supply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the biggest U.S. gas producer, Exxon also was stung by a
29 percent plunge in gas prices to an average of $2.893 per
million British thermal units during the quarter. Tillerson said
in June that gas producers have been &#8220;losing our shirts&#8221; as
drilling innovations allowed explorers to penetrate North
American shale formations, leading to a supply glut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s gas production declined by 9.3 percent during the
quarter to 11 billion cubic feet a day, according to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;World Supplies &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as Exxon output was falling, total worldwide crude
output increased by 2.16 million barrels a day during the third
quarter from a year earlier, overwhelming demand that grew by
just 540,000 barrels, according to an Oct. 12 report by the
International Energy Agency. Rising oil usage in major economies
such as China, Japan, India and Russia was insufficient to
offset falling demand in the U.S., the world&#8217;s largest crude
market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon agreed on Sept. 20 to pay about $2 billion in cash
and assets for Denbury Resources Inc. (DNR)&#8217;s drilling rights to
196,000 net acres in the Bakken Shale formation beneath North
Dakota and Montana. The transaction will boost Exxon&#8217;s holdings
in the region by about 50 percent, the company said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Exxon added more shale acreage to its portfolio
with a C$2.86 billion ($2.86 billion) agreement to purchase
Celtic Exploration Ltd. (CLT) The acquisition, Exxon&#8217;s largest since
the $35 billion takeover of XTO Energy in June 2010, will
provide access to the Montney and Duvernay formations in western
Canada. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, narrowed its 2012 forecast after reporting third-
quarter earnings that met analyst estimates and sales that fell
short of expectations. The company also said it was buying back
as much as $10 billion in shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income in the third quarter fell 14 percent to $3.21
billion, or 43 cents a share, from $3.74 billion, or 48 cents, a
year earlier, New York-based Pfizer said today in a statement.
Earnings excluding one-time items matched the 53 cents average
of 16 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales decreased 16 percent to $14 billion, more than $600
million below analyst estimates. The company&#8217;s former top seller
Lipitor, in the first full quarter facing competition from
copycat generics, saw sales fall 71 percent to $749 million from
a year earlier. Pfizer has fought to hold on to sales of the
cholesterol pill, using discounts and coupons to keep customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to believe that building a pipeline that
delivers sustained revenue and profit growth is the most
enduring driver of multiple growth,&#8221; said Tony Butler, a drug
industry analyst with Barclays Plc in New York, in an Oct. 15
note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts had projected third-quarter revenue of $14.7
billion. The sales miss was due to foreign currency exchange
rates that trimmed 4 percent, said Timothy Anderson, an analyst
with Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in New York. In a note to
clients today, he called the buyback program &#8220;not a surprise.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rapamune Charge &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the quarter, Pfizer also had a $491 million charge
to net income from a settlement with the U.S. Department of
Justice over marketing of Rapamune, a transplant drug, that
Pfizer got with its 2009 purchase of Wyeth. Offsetting that was
$1.1 billion Pfizer got from tax audits in its favor by the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company narrowed its full year adjusted earnings
forecast to $2.14 to $2.17 a share, from $2.12 to $2.22 a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer also announced a $10 billion share buyback program
once the sale of its nutrition unit to Nestle SA (NESN) for $11.85
billion closes, in the &#8220;next few months,&#8221; the company said.
That means that almost the entire proceeds from the nutrition
unit sale will go to buybacks. Pfizer also has $4.1 billion left
in its current repurchase program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Share Buybacks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#8217;s no defined limit on how far the share buybacks will
extend, said Chief Executive Officer Ian Read. &#8220;We look at
total shareholder return, through the performance of the
business, dividends and buybacks,&#8221; he said in a telephone
interview after the announcement. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see it as an &#8217;or,&#8217; I
see it as an &#8217;and,&#8217;&#8221; he said, comparing buybacks to other
activities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer fell 1.3 percent to $24.55 at the 4 p.m. close of
New York trading. The shares have gained 27 percent in the past
12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our results this quarter reflect continued product losses
of exclusivity, most notably Lipitor in all major markets,&#8221;
Read said in a statement announcing the results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is divesting its nutrition and animal health units
as part of its plan to refocus the company on developing and
selling new prescription drugs. Its two $2 billion-plus
prospects include a blood thinner, Eliquis, being co-developed
with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY), and a rheumatoid arthritis pill,
tofacitinib. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The animal health business will be spun off in an initial
public offering and stock swap before the first half of next
year. The unit had $4.19 billion in sales last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Last &#8216;Lever&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Once nutritionals and animal health businesses are gone,
Pfizer will revisit further the option of splitting up more,&#8221;
said Sanford C. Bernstein&#8217;s Anderson. &#8220;This is perhaps the last
major &#8217;lever&#8217; that Pfizer can pull, and doing so would likely
energize investors,&#8221; he said in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has already restructured operations in developed
markets, and is now looking at its business in emerging markets
for more efficiency, Read said. The CEO, however, said today
that though he considers its new drugs and established products
units as separate businesses, he plans no formal separation of
the two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I haven&#8217;t used the word &#8217;separation,&#8217;&#8221; he said on a
conference call today. &#8220;I&#8217;ve said, &#8217;I see two businesses,&#8217; one
that&#8217;s value and one that&#8217;s innovative.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyrica, used to treat pain, is now Pfizer&#8217;s top product.
The pill sold $1.04 billion, up 8 percent from a year earlier.
Other top drugs saw their sales decline. Second best-selling was
Enbrel, for rheumatoid arthritis, which sold $893 million, down
7 percent, partly on foreign exchange rates. Pneumococcal
vaccine Prevnar, which Pfizer is seeking to expand use of in
older populations, sold $868 million, down 14 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;FDA Decision &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker is waiting on decisions by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration on tofacitinib, expected by Nov. 21, and
Eliquis, due in March. It is hoping to get both 5-milligram and
10-milligram doses of tofacitinib approved, Geno Germano,
president of specialty care, said on a conference call
discussing the quarterly results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tofacitinib could sell $2.16 billion by 2017, according to
the average of three analyst estimates compiled Bloomberg.
Eliquis, meanwhile, could generate $5.2 billion in sales by
2020, which will be split with Bristol-Myers, Catherine Arnold,
an analyst with Credit Suisse Group AG, said in a note to
clients. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) lost a bid
to avoid trial in a lawsuit over the 2000 sale of Dragon Systems
Inc., a pioneer in voice-recognition software, to a Belgian
competitor that collapsed following an accounting scandal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Patti Saris in Boston yesterday
declined Goldman Sachs&#8217;s request to throw out claims by James
and Janet Baker, Dragon System&#8217;s founders, that Goldman Sachs
failed to provide adequate advice in the sale of their $600
million company for stock in Lernout  Hauspie Speech Products
NV. Goldman Sachs was paid $5 million for advising Dragon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bakers, who owned 51 percent of Dragon Systems at the
time of the transaction, claim they lost about $300 million and
the rights to patents they developed as voice-recognition
researchers, when Lernout  Hauspie failed months after it was
sold. The Belgian company filed for bankruptcy protection in
November 2000 after public disclosure of improper accounting
forced it to restate $373 million in earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bakers claim Goldman should have warned Dragon about
deficiencies in Lernout  Hauspie&#8217;s accounting. Saris&#8217;s ruling
yesterday clears the way for a trial in the case, which is set
to begin Dec. 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said that
Lernout  Hauspie created bogus customers, booked circular
transactions with shell companies and recorded loans as sales
from 1996 to 2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The court has denied all of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s efforts to
prevent a trial,&#8221; said Alan Cotler, the Bakers&#8217; lawyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a Goldman spokesman, declined to comment
on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Baker v. Goldman Sachs  Co., 09-cv-10053, U.S.
District Court, District of Massachusetts (Boston). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Verizon
Communications Inc. (VZ) led borrowers in the U.S. selling $15.1
billion of bonds in the busiest Friday this year as issuers
stymied by Hurricane Sandy try to complete deals before the U.S.
presidential election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker, sold $2.25
billion of securities in three parts and New York-based Verizon
raised $4.5 billion in its first bond sale this year, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales exceed this year&#8217;s daily
average of $6.1 billion and compare with $2.9 billion on Oct.
26. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issuers rushed to market at the end of a week shortened by
a virtual three-day hiatus amid the biggest Atlantic storm in
history. As electricity and mass transit are gradually restored,
issuers looked to lock in record-low borrowing costs after
today&#8217;s better-than-expected jobs report and before next week&#8217;s
presidential elections, according to Jody Lurie at Janney
Montgomery Scott LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a very one-time, unusual event,&#8221; Lurie, a
Philadelphia-based corporate credit analyst, said in a telephone
interview. The unemployment figures are giving borrowers &#8220;a
green light to say, &#8216;OK, go time, don&#8217;t wait,&#8221;&#8217; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on U.S. corporate bonds reached a record-low 3.58
percent on Oct. 19 before increasing to 3.62 percent yesterday,
according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate 
High Yield Master index. The extra yield investors demand to own
corporate bonds rather than government debentures rose to 231
basis points from 227 basis points on Oct. 26. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Microsoft Offering &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the manufacturer of the Windows operating
system, sold $600 million of 0.875 percent, five-year notes at a
relative yield of 27 basis points, $750 million of 2.125
percent, 10-year securities at a spread of 47 basis points and
$900 million of 3.5 percent, 30-year debt at 67 basis points as
soon as today, Bloomberg data show. The Redmond, Washington-
based company&#8217;s bonds are rated Aaa, the highest level of
investment grade, by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, the ratings
company said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon, the second-largest U.S. phone company, raised $1
billion of 0.7 percent, three-year notes at a spread of 32 basis
points; $500 million of 1.1 percent, five-year debt at 42 basis
points; $1.75 billion of 2.45 percent, 10-year securities at 75
basis points; and $1.25 billion of 3.85 percent, 30-year debt at
97 basis points, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Verizon Issue &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company last issued debt in October 2011 and proceeds
will be used to pay existing debt and for general corporate
purposes, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the Oct. 29 storm, power had been restored to 4.6
million customers as of yesterday, or about 45 percent of those
affected, according to the U.S. Energy Department. The outages
pose &#8220;a real, serious threat&#8221; of disruption to voting on Nov.
6 in Nassau County, New York&#8217;s largest suburban jurisdiction,
said William Biamonte, the county Democratic election
commissioner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Washington Post/ABC News national tracking poll released
yesterday showed presidential candidates Barack Obama and Mitt Romney essentially tied, with 49 percent of likely voters
supporting Obama and 48 percent with Romney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last jobs report before next week&#8217;s election, a net
171,000 workers were added to payrolls in October after a
148,000 gain in September that was more than first estimated,
Labor Department figures showed today in Washington. The
increase exceeded the most optimistic forecast in a Bloomberg
survey in which the median called for an advance of 125,000. The
unemployment rate rose to 7.9 percent from 7.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Accelerating Funding &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Companies are trying to take advantage of the current
low-rate environment, in case there is a shift in the yield
curve after the elections,&#8221; Alan Shepard, an analyst at
Madison, Wisconsin-based Madison Investment Holdings Inc., which
oversees about $16 billion, wrote in an e-mail. For firms in
need of financing, &#8220;they may be accelerating their funding to
get it in now, in an environment that is known, rather than do
the funding at a potentially higher cost in a more uncertain
environment post-election,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aetna Inc. (AET), the third-biggest U.S. health insurer, sold $2
billion of debt split into $500 million of 1.5 percent, five-
year notes at a spread of 88 basis points, $1 billion of 2.75
percent, 10-year securities at 123 basis points and $500 million
of 4.125 percent, 30-year debt at 133 basis points, Bloomberg
data show. Proceeds will be used to help finance the company&#8217;s
purchase of Coventry Health Care Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clear Channel &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to today&#8217;s sales, Clear Channel Communications
Inc. plans to raise $2.73 billion next week through a unit of
its Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings business, the San Antonio-
based company said today in a statement. Proceeds will fund a
tender offer for as much as $2.5 billion of shorter-term
securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clear Channel Worldwide, which manages advertising
displays, will offer about $736 million of 10-year series A
senior notes and about $2 billion of similar-maturity series B
bonds. Pricing is set for Nov. 5, according to a person familiar
with the transaction who asked not to be identified because the
terms are private. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, will provide $5 million in loans to
small businesses affected by Hurricane Sandy with the firm and
its staff donating an equal amount for cleanup and recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loans match the $5 million that New York City is
offering to small businesses in Zone A and other areas affected
by flooding and power failures, the company said today in a
statement on its website. Amounts ranging from $5,000 to $25,000
will be available within five to seven days after application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Many small businesses in our communities have been
devastated by this disaster, and fast access to capital will
help them get back on their feet more quickly,&#8221; Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 58, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The money from the city and Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Urban
Investment Group will be available through the New York Business
Development Corp., the company said. The program is expected to
be running by Nov. 5, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s employees, who will be making donations through
Goldman Sachs Gives, also will volunteer for cleanup, food
delivery and rebuilding projects, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs headquarters in Lower Manhattan and its
building across the Hudson River in Jersey City, New Jersey, had
&#8220;a little bit of flooding&#8221; as a result of the storm, Gary D. Cohn, the firm&#8217;s chief operating officer, said on Bloomberg
Television&#8217;s &#8220;Market Makers with Erik Schatzker and Stephanie Ruhle&#8221; on Oct. 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We clearly feel an obligation and a responsibility to the
neighborhood and the people that live there,&#8221; said Cohn, 52. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brevan Howard Asset Management LLP,
Europe&#8217;s second-largest hedge fund, hired Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. credit trader Wayne Leslie, said a person with knowledge of
the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leslie, who headed European investment-grade trading at
Goldman Sachs, will work for Brevan Howard in London, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the information
is private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brevan Howard, which oversees $39 billion, hired the credit
trader as hedge funds focused on debt outperform the rest of the
industry. Funds investing in corporate bonds have gained 8
percent this year on average through September, beating the 4.9
percent return for the broader industry, according to Chicago-
based Hedge Fund Research Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sophie Bullock, a spokeswoman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs (GS), confirmed that Leslie left the bank last month. She
declined to comment further. Leslie and officials at London-
based Brevan Howard declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traders have been leaving banks as lenders cut risk-taking
and bonus payments following the 2008 credit crisis. Antoine
Cornut, who led flow-credit trading in Europe and the Americas
for Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank AG, plans to start his own
hedge fund after resigning from the lender in July, two people
familiar with the matter said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brevan Howard&#8217;s main fund posted a 1.5 percent gain this
year through Oct. 19, according to a person with knowledge of
the returns. Competing macro funds, which bet on interest rates,
stocks, bonds and currencies based on global economic trends,
rose 0.9 percent on average this year through September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Howard, 49, started Brevan Howard 10 years ago with
four other fixed-income traders from Credit Suisse Group AG. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, is offering benchmark bonds in three parts with
its first sale in 21 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manufacturer of the Windows operating system may sell
five-year notes, 10-year securities and 30-year debt as soon as
today, according to a person familiar with the transaction.
Proceeds from the offering, which will be of benchmark size,
typically at least $500 million, will be used for general
corporate purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company last sold debt in February 2011, issuing $1
billion of 5.3 percent, 30-year bonds, $750 million of 2.5
percent, five-year notes and $500 million of 4 percent, 10-year
securities, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The notes
due February 2021 traded at 116.1 cents on the dollar to yield
1.89 percent on Oct. 24, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new bonds may be rated Aaa, the highest level of
investment grade, by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, said the person,
who asked not to be identified because terms aren&#8217;t set.
Barclays Plc, JPMorgan Chase  Co. and UBS AG are managing the
sale for the Redmond, Washington-based company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-biggest
U.S. energy company by market value, said third-quarter profit
declined as output plunged to a 4-year low, oil prices slumped
and refining income dropped 65 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income was $5.25 billion, or $2.69 a share, compared
with $7.83 billion, or $3.92, a year earlier, San Ramon,
California-based Chevron said in a statement today. Per-share
results were 15 cents less than the $2.84 average of 19
analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil and natural gas production from Chevron&#8217;s wells dropped
to the lowest since the third quarter of 2008 after Hurricane
Isaac shut output in the Gulf of Mexico and oilfield repairs
were conducted in Kazakhstan and the U.K. Isaac also forced the
shutdown of Chevron&#8217;s largest refinery in Pascagoula,
Mississippi, and a fire damaged the company&#8217;s San Francisco-area
plant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s fuel-production profit fell by $1.3 billion to
$689 million because of the plant outages and declining fuel
margins. The U.S. margin for processing oil into gasoline and
diesel fell 5.2 percent to an average of $30.86 per barrel
during the quarter, based on benchmark futures contracts traded
in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Watson is
spending almost $90 million a day this year to expand the search
for untapped reserves from the Indian Ocean to the Baltic Sea.
The company is aiming to raise production by one-fifth by the
end of 2017 to the equivalent of 3.3 million barrels of crude. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Energy Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earnings statement was released before the opening of
regular U.S. stock trading. Chevron rose 1.1 percent yesterday
to $111.46 at the close in New York. Sales fell 9.9 percent to
$58.04 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit from oil and gas wells declined by 17 percent to
$5.14 billion as output fell to the equivalent of 2.52 million
barrels of crude a day from 2.6 million a year earlier,
according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent crude futures, the benchmark for two-thirds of the
world&#8217;s oil, fell 2.4 percent during the quarter to an average
of $109.42 a barrel. Worldwide crude output rose by 2.16 million
barrels a day during the third quarter from a year earlier, four
times faster than the 540,000-barrel-a-day increase in demand,
according to an Oct. 12 report by the International Energy
Agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s performance also was diminished by a 29 percent
decline in U.S. gas prices from a year earlier to an average of
$2.893 per million British thermal units during the quarter.
Horizontal wells and hydraulic fracturing have allowed explorers
to penetrate gas-rich shale formations in the U.S. Great Plains,
Appalachia and western Canada, leading to a North American
supply glut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron has risen 4.7 percent this year, outperforming the
1.8 percent increase in Brent crude futures. The shares have 20
buy recommendations from analysts, eight holds and one sell
rating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nestle SA (NESN), the world&#8217;s largest food
company, won regulatory approval in China for its $11.9 billion
acquisition of Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s infant-nutrition unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese authorities cleared the deal this week, Chief
Executive Officer Paul Bulcke said today at the inauguration of
Nestle&#8217;s health-science institute in Lausanne, Switzerland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestle agreed in April to buy Pfizer&#8217;s baby-food business,
edging out rival Danone. The acquisition will help the Swiss
company, already the top seller of infant-nutrition products,
regain traction in the Chinese baby-food market, where it has
been losing market share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulcke also said today that Nestle has no plans to
recombine its health-science and nutrition businesses after
placing them under the same leadership this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is no intention to put it altogether,&#8221; the CEO
said at the press briefing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestle said Oct. 30 that Luis Cantarell, the health-science
head, would also run its nutrition business after the current
chief, Kurt Schmidt, resigned. Nestle set up the health-science
unit in January 2011 to combine the company&#8217;s existing medical
nutrition business with investments in start-ups. The division
is working on nutrition products aimed at helping conditions
ranging from gastrointestinal disease to diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schmidt&#8217;s departure caps a decade during which Nestle has
repeatedly organized and reformed a business central to its
strategy of being the world&#8217;s &#8220;leading nutrition, health and
wellness&#8221; company. Cantarell ran the nutrition unit from 2001
to 2005 and has worked more than three decades at Nestle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL) was criticized by U.K.
judges for posting a notice on its website about a lawsuit with
Samsung Electronics Co. that was &#8220;untrue&#8221; and &#8220;incorrect.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. Court of Appeal in London ordered Apple to remove
the statement within 24 hours and replace it with a new notice
acknowledging the inaccurate comments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m at a loss that a company such as Apple would do
this,&#8221; Judge Robin Jacob said yesterday. &#8220;That is a plain
breach of the order.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision is the latest in a lawsuit that produced a
July judgment in which another London court said the design for
three Samsung Galaxy tablets didn&#8217;t infringe Apple&#8217;s registered
design because they were not &#8220;cool&#8221; enough. Apple, based in
Cupertino, California, was told by the same court last month to
post a notice about the ruling that Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy tablets
didn&#8217;t copy the design of Apple&#8217;s iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court&#8217;s initial order was for a simple notice on its
website about the Oct. 18 judgment meant to correct the
impression Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung had copied Apple&#8217;s
product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple&#8217;s post, criticized by judges yesterday, inserted four
paragraphs including excerpts of the original &#8220;cool&#8221; ruling
regarding the tablets&#8217; coolness that appear to favor Apple and
details of German lawsuits about similar issues that the court
yesterday said weren&#8217;t true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notice created the &#8220;impression that the U.K. court is
out of step with other courts,&#8221; Henry Carr, Samsung&#8217;s lawyer,
said in a filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was clear the judges were not happy with what Apple
had done,&#8221; Gary Moss, a lawyer at EIP Partnership LLP who isn&#8217;t
involved in the case but attended yesterday&#8217;s hearing, said in a
phone interview. &#8220;They thought Apple was playing fast and
loose.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Hely, a spokesman for Apple, declined to comment on
the ruling. Michael Beloff, a lawyer for the company, told the
court the comments were in line with the original order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notice &#8220;is not designed to punish, it is not designed
to makes us grovel,&#8221; Beloff said in court yesterday. &#8220;The only
purpose is to dispel commercial uncertainty.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple&#8217;s request for 14 days to make the changes was
rejected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would like to see the head of Apple make an affidavit
setting out the technical difficulties which means Apple can&#8217;t
put this on&#8221; their website, Jacob said. &#8220;I just can&#8217;t believe
the instructions you&#8217;ve been given. This is Apple. They cannot
put something on their website?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple must now add a three sentence note on its homepage in
acknowledgment of &#8220;the incorrect statement,&#8221; with a link to a
new notice, the judges said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activist&#8217;s Estate Says Permission Needed for &#8216;Gay is Good&#8217; Use &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The efforts of a gay-rights activist to set up a page on
Facebook Inc. (FB)&#8217;s social media site highlighting contributions
gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people have made to
society has run into a potential trademark problem, the
Washington Blade newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher Dyer of Washington received a cease-and-desist
letter telling him his slogan for the page -- &#8220;Gay is Good,
Make LGBT Great&#8221; -- infringed a registered U.S. trademark,
according to the Blade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;Gay is Good&#8221; mark was created by the late Frank
Kameny, a gay rights activist, and registered by his estate with
the intention of make sure the phrase is always used in a
respectful fashion, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dyer, former head of the Office of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual
and Transgender Affairs in Washington, told the Blade that while
he&#8217;ll quit using the phrase, he is &#8220;frankly disgusted&#8221; the
estate registered the trademark and is trying to control its
use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Aussie Registers &#8216;Mate,&#8217; Hopes to Rival Billabong&#8217;s Reach &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Australian truck driver has registered &#8220;mate&#8221; as a
trademark in his county, Queensland, Australia&#8217;s Sunshine Coast
Daily reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trent Lecky of Bli Bli, Australia, said he wants to turn
his mark &#8220;into an Australian brand that people around the world
can relate to,&#8221; according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that while his goal isn&#8217;t necessarily to make
money, he hopes to sell 1,000 shirts through his
MateAustralia.com website by Christmas and eventually rival
Billabong International Ltd. (BBG) as an Australian clothing brand,
the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lecky told the newspaper he is using a page on Facebook
Inc.&#8217;s social media site to promote his brand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Patents &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;FTC Staff Said to Formally Recommend Google Patent Suit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) should be sued by the Federal Trade Commission
for trying to block competitors&#8217; access to key smartphone-
technology patents in violation of antitrust law, the agency&#8217;s
staff told commissioners in a formal recommendation, according
to four people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A majority of the agency&#8217;s five commissioners are inclined
to sue, according to the people, who declined to be identified
because the matter isn&#8217;t public. A final decision on the staff
recommendation, made last month, isn&#8217;t likely until after the
Nov. 6 presidential election, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At issue are Google&#8217;s efforts to block U.S. imports of
products made by Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Apple Inc. by claiming the
devices, which rely on industry-standard technology, infringe
patents owned by Google&#8217;s Motorola Mobility unit, the people
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We take our commitments to license on fair, reasonable,
and non-discriminatory terms very seriously and are happy to
answer any questions,&#8221; Niki Fenwick, a Google spokeswoman,
said. Peter Kaplan, a spokesman for the FTC, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FTC opened a formal probe into the matter in June, when
it began seeking information from companies including Microsoft
and Apple about whether Google offered licensing for technology
under patents that help operate 3G wireless, Wi-Fi and video
streaming on fair and reasonable terms, a person familiar with
the matter said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industry-standard technology helps ensure that different
manufacturers&#8217; products, such as mobile phone antennas and
global-positioning system software, work together. Companies
that create technology that helps develop the agreed-upon
industry standard pledge to license patents for those inventions
on reasonable terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Argentina Seed Law May Be Postponed Until 2013, Cronista Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argentina&#8217;s Congress may postpone until 2013 a debate on a
seed law to protect intellectual property rights for
agricultural biotechnology, El Cronista said, citing
unidentified executives from seed producers such as Asociados
Don Mario SA and Nidera SA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress will delay the debate after opposition from some
farm organizations, Buenos Aires-based El Cronista said. Seed
producers support the proposed law that will primarily benefit
Monsanto Co. (MON), which has a patent for seeds in Argentina, it
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farmers aren&#8217;t currently required to pay royalties on seeds
they withhold for the next planting season, the newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s &#8216;Mr. Young&#8217; Accused of Infringing &#8216;Student Teacher&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS), which agreed this week to buy George Lucas&#8217;s Lucasfilm Ltd. for $4.05 billion, was sued for copyright
infringement by a Los Angeles screenwriter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint filed Oct. 30 in federal court
in Los Angeles, the company is accused of infringing copyrights
to a script and &#8220;show bible&#8221; for &#8220;Student Teacher,&#8221; a
television series about a student who becomes the teacher in his
class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emir Tiar, who writes as E.T. Radcliffe, said he submitted
the script and the show bible -- a written sales pitch for the
script -- through the William Morris Agency, which he said
showed interest in his project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that after initial discussions with Morris, he was
told in 2009 his project was too &#8220;high concept&#8221; for American
audiences and that the script was unmarketable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiar later discovered a program &#8220;Mr. Young&#8221; airing on one
of the Disney channels.  The program, he said contains &#8220;all the
elements&#8221; of &#8220;Student Teacher.&#8221; He claims Disney is now
earning money from infringing his script, and that he is damaged
by the studio&#8217;s actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Morris agency is co-defendant with Disney, as are a
Canadian production company that filmed the show and producer
Dan Signer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiar asked the court to declare his copyright is infringed,
and that he is entitled to &#8220;at least $100 million based on the
fact that the television series is now in its third season and
is being broadcast in 31 different countries,&#8221; according to
court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, he asked for awards of litigation costs and
attorney fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney didn&#8217;t respond immediately to an e-mailed request
for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Emir Tiar v. Walt Disney Co., 2:12-cv-09323-GW-
FFM, U.S. District Court, Central District of California (Los
Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Arbitron, Magic Broadcasting Settle Copyright-Infringement Suit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arbitron Inc. (ARB), the media research and marketing firm,
settled a copyright-infringement dispute with Magic Broadcasting
LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to an Oct. 31 statement from the Columbia,
Maryland-based company, the dispute had involved the use of some
of its rating data after the expiration of a contract with
Magic, the former owner and operator of six FM radio stations in
Alabama. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magic, based in Panama City Beach, Florida, had a license
to use Arbitron audience-measurement reports through March 31,
2010. Arbitron filed the infringement suit in November 2011,
after saying it found that Magic was using Arbitron data to
promote the radio stations after the license ended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute was settled for an undisclosed sum, Arbitron
said in its statement. Magic agreed to refrain from making any
future unauthorized use of Arbitron ratings data and its on-air
personalities are barred from making any reference to the data,
the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Arbitron Inc. v. Magic Broadcasting LLC, 1:11-
cv-08311-DLC, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
