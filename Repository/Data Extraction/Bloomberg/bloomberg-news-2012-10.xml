<p>Intel Corp. (INTC)''s delayed delivery of
software that conserves computer battery life is holding up
development of some tablets running the latest version of
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)''s Windows operating system, a person with
knowledge of the matter said. </p>
<p>Microsoft hasn''t yet approved any tablets featuring an
Intel processor code-named Clover Trail because the chipmaker
hasn''t produced necessary power-management software, said the
person, who asked not to be named since the process is private. </p>
<p>The delay, following remarks by Intel Chief Executive
Officer Paul Otellini, who told employees in Taiwan that Windows
8 needs improvement, underscores how the Wintel alliance that
has dominated the personal computer industry for three decades
is struggling to respond to the threat of Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s iPad. At
stake is the chance to make up for lackluster PC buying by
capturing users who are flocking to mobile devices, snappy
applications and elegant design. </p>
<p>The PC channel is in chaos right now, said Alex Gauna,
an analyst at JMP Securities LLC in San Francisco. They don''t
know what to do. They don''t know what to design for, they don''t
know what the consumers are going to buy. Tablets have stolen
their growth trajectory, plus the macro situation, plus Wintel
has made a mess of their ecosystem. </p>
<p>PC makers, including Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ), Dell Inc. (DELL) and
Lenovo Group Ltd. (992), are counting on the new version of Windows to
help them compete in the $63.2 billion tablet market dominated
by Apple. </p>
<h2>Fighting Apple </h2>
<p>Any software development delay gives manufacturers less
time to get their tablets ready for the year-end holiday
shopping season, undermining attempts to erode Apple''s 70
percent share of tablets. </p>
<p>Tablets featuring Clover Trail are the ones designed by
Intel to most closely compete with the iPad. The industry can
ill afford a slowdown in getting them into stores with the next
iPad due to be released in March or April, said Wes Miller, an
analyst at Directions on Microsoft, based in Kirkland,
Washington. </p>
<p>It''s bad news for Microsoft and Intel because it''s not
going to present the best light on either one and it will hurt
the perception of Windows 8, Miller said. </p>
<p>While Windows is fundamentally sound, the operating system
lacks a wide range of robust applications and PC makers haven''t
had enough time to work out kinks with so-called drivers, which
connect software to such hardware as printers, according to
Directions on Microsoft. </p>
<h2>ARM Threat </h2>
<p>Microsoft has certified some 800 machines with the new
software, said Mark Martin, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-
based Microsoft. That includes tablets running low-power chips
with technology from ARM Holdings Plc (ARM) on a version of the
software called RT. The recent entrant to the Windows family
compounds threats to Intel. </p>
<p>Microsoft has worked closely with Intel and our hardware
partners, Martin said in a statement. We look forward to the
new Atom-based offerings from Intel to complement the already
strong Windows 8 and Windows RT ecosystem. </p>
<p>Tablets and laptops convertible into tablets built on
Clover Trail will be available Oct. 26, said Jon Carvill, a
spokesman for Santa Clara, California-based Intel. </p>
<p>We''re excited about the opportunity for Windows 8 tablets
with a broad range of Intel chips, Carvill said. We''ve
collaborated very closely with Microsoft in extensive testing
and validation for chips, he said. </p>
<p>Intel rose less than one percent to $22.76 at the close in
New York. The stock has declined 6.2 percent this year, while
the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index has gained 15 percent. Microsoft
fell 0.9 percent to $29.49. The stock is up 14 percent this
year. </p>
<h2>China, Brazil </h2>
<p>Intel held an event last week showcasing Clover Trail-based
tablets from Acer Inc. (2353), Asustek Computer Inc. (2357), Dell, Fujitsu
Ltd. (6702), Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo and Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) The
new devices, many of which featured detachable keyboards, have
weeks of standby time and are capable of playing high-definition
video for 10 hours. </p>
<p>Still, any delays caused by unfinished software or untested
hardware in tablets, laptops and desktops would be harmful to an
industry already seeing demand faltering in China and Brazil,
countries that until recently could be counted on to compensate
for weakness in the U.S. and Europe. </p>
<p>The refresh of the software that runs more than 90 percent
of all personal computers typically leads PC makers to stock up
on parts in anticipation of a surge in orders. Microprocessor
shipments have risen an average 6.7 percent in the quarter
before new Windows PCs go on sale, according to Mercury
Research, while PC sales gained by more than 15 percent in each
of the past two release quarters, researcher IDC said. </p>
<h2>Sales Decline </h2>
<p>This time around, Intel is on pace for a sequential decline
in third-quarter sales for the first time in two decades.
Western Digital Corp. (WDC) trimmed its forecast for disk drives, and
analysts at IDC said the PC market will expand less than 1
percent this year -- the worst performance since it shrank in
2001. </p>
<p>It''s a tough environment right now, said Dean McCarron,
an analyst at Cave Creek, Arizona-based Mercury Research, who
has been tracking PC-industry data for two decades. </p>
<p>According to McCarron, computer-processor industry sales
have posted as steep a decline only twice before in 20 years: in
2000, amid the bursting of the dot-com bubble, and in the fourth
quarter of 2008, after the financial meltdown. He estimates that
8 million fewer PC processors will ship last quarter than the
previous period, which means fewer PCs built. </p>
<p>Chip orders are an important indicator of how confident
manufacturers are of what will happen when the new PC models go
on sale. </p>
<h2>Touch Screen </h2>
<p>While consumers no longer stand in line outside stores to
get the latest version of Microsoft''s operating system, as they
did when Windows 95 went on sale in August of that year, even
versions like Vista -- which was panned by reviewers -- can help
the industry. PC sales jumped 15.3 percent from a year earlier
in the quarter Windows Vista debuted. Its replacement, Windows
7, prompted a 15.2 percent increase, according to IDC. </p>
<p>In answer to the surging popularity of handheld devices led
by the iPad, Microsoft has given Windows 8 a touch-screen
interface. It has also opened up Windows to chip technology
other than Intel''s, and is plotting a move into the hardware
market itself with a line of tablets, dubbed Surface. </p>
<p>All that may be cold comfort for Intel and other
traditional PC component makers, because in many cases tablets
rely on parts better made by competing suppliers. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, tablet shipments have more than tripled in 2011
and will jump 67 percent this year, according to an estimate by
JPMorgan Chase  Co. </p>
<h2>Lateness Hurts </h2>
<p>It''s obvious that tablets are taking sales from
notebooks, said Chris Danely, an analyst at JPMorgan in San
Francisco. We''re all buying tablets. </p>
<p>With a growing list of Windows 8-based designs to choose
from -- notebooks, tablets, laptops with touch screens, touch-
screen desktops, laptops with detachable screens that become
tablets -- PC makers have avoided snapping up their usual
stockpiles of parts until demand is more clear, according to CJ Muse, an analyst at Barclays Plc. </p>
<p>Folks are sitting on their hands in terms of what they''re
building and they''re planning on air-shipping whatever starts to
sell, said Muse. There''s just too much uncertainty. </p>
<p>Still, the main obstacle isn''t lack of enthusiasm about
Windows 8. The underlying challenge is that Microsoft and Intel
were too late with products aimed at fending off tablets, said
Doug Freedman, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. </p>
<p>Intel began pushing Ultrabooks, slim-line laptops that
start up instantly, last year. The devices haven''t come down in
price fast enough to woo buyers, and Windows 8''s planned arrival
Oct. 26 has given Apple and other tablet makers too much of a
head start. </p>
<p>They''re six to nine months late, Freedman said. They
haven''t put their best foot forward against the tablet. </p>

<p>Irene Tse, the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) partner hired by JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s chief investment office to help manage the bank''s balance sheet while it boosted risk, is leaving to start a hedge fund. </p> <p>Tse, 43, hired by New York-based JPMorgan less than two years ago as chief investment officer for North America, is starting her own fund early next year, said people with knowledge of the matter, requesting anonymity because her plans haven''t been announced. The fund will make investments based on trends in the global economy, the people said. </p> <p>JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, has been curbing risk in the chief investment office after London traders built a position in credit derivatives that cost the firm $5.8 billion in the first half of the year. Tse''s departure deprives the unit of one of its most senior leaders following changes and dismissals that stemmed from the botched bets by  U.K.-based trader Bruno Iksil, nicknamed the London Whale  because the wagers were big enough to move the market. </p> <p>Former Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew, 56, who retired four days after Dimon announced the initial losses on May 10, hired Tse in January 2011 to oversee North America. Tse came from Stanley Druckenmiller''s hedge fund Duquesne Capital Management LLC, where she spent three years as a portfolio manager trading mortgage securities and betting on interest rates, foreign exchange, credit, equity, commodities and structured products. </p>

<p>The $6.5 trillion market for
investment-grade company bonds is the most attractive for risk-
averse fixed-income investors, according to Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth most-active underwriter of top-
tier corporate debt in the U.S., joins investors from BlackRock
Inc. to Loews Corp. in saying there''s still value in the bonds
even after the biggest rally in two years. The Federal Reserve
is suppressing yields on the debt with its plans to stimulate a
slowing economy, which include its expectation of keeping
interest rates near zero through mid-2015. </p>
<p>We expect the search for yield to intensify, analysts
led by Charles Himmelberg wrote in a Sept. 28 report. Recent
central bank actions have reinvigorated the relative value case
for credit within fixed income. </p>
<p>Investors funneled $2.1 billion into U.S. funds that buy
investment-grade debt last week while pulling $5 million from
those that focus on junk bonds, according to a Sept. 27 report
by Bank of America Corp. (BAC) analysts. The best-rated company notes
gained 0.6 percent last week compared with a 0.6 decline in junk
bonds, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. </p>
<p>Investors will be forced to look elsewhere for
duration, the Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in the report. To
satisfy this demand in liquid U.S. dollar markets, corporate
bonds would be the only realistic option. </p>

<p>A federal appeals court in Manhattan

<p>Citibank NA arranged the swap for protection in the event
that a collateralized debt obligation based on a line of credit

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) said its Sutent pill will
continue to be the standard treatment for renal cell carcinoma
after GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) said its competing Votrient drug
showed similar effectiveness with fewer side effects. </p>
<p>Patients taking Sutent survived an average of 9.5 months
without the disease progressing, compared with 8.4 months for
those on Votrient, in a study of 1,100 patients, London-based
Glaxo said yesterday. Side effects such as fatigue and skin
sores occurred with less frequency for Votrient. </p>
<p>One of the study''s authors yesterday suggested new patients
may now view Votrient more favorably than Sutent, which commands
about half the U.S. market for renal cancer treatments since
gaining approval in 2006 for Pfizer, the world''s largest
drugmaker. Still, physicians and patients have experience using
Sutent and have learned to manage the side effects, said Robin
Wiltshire, head of global medical affairs for New York-based
Pfizer''s drug. </p>
<p>I''m confident that Sutent will remain the standard of
care, Wiltshire said in a phone interview from Vienna after
attending the European Society for Medical Oncology''s annual
meeting. Over time, physicians and their patients have really
learned good strategies for helping to manage the therapy. </p>
<p>Severity of side effects can be reduced through methods
such as using hand creams for the skin sores, changing diets to
manage diarrhea and reducing doses, Wiltshire said. </p>
<p>Sutent had global sales of $1.19 billion in 2011, compared
with 100 million pounds ($160 million) for Votrient, which was
approved for use in the U.S. in 2009 for advanced renal cell
carcinoma. </p>
<p>Renal cell carcinoma is a type of kidney cancer that starts
in the lining of the tubes in the kidney. </p>

<p>Investors are buying record amounts
of notes paying returns based on ruble bonds as Russia prepares
to open the market to foreigners, triggering inflows Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. estimates may reach $30 billion. </p>
<p>Sales of the structured notes reached $641 million between
July and September, the most since Bloomberg began compiling the
data in 1999. Russia''s so-called OFZ bonds gained 3.8 percent
during the quarter as yields tumbled 43 basis points to 7.25
percent, JPMorgan Chase  Co. indexes show. The average yield on
similarly rated Mexican government bonds slipped eight basis
points to 5.7 percent, the indexes show. </p>
<p>Russia plans to expand the investor base for its 3.1
trillion-ruble ($96 billion) Treasuries market by allowing
foreign investors to buy and sell through Euroclear Bank SA, the
world''s biggest bond settlement system, after five years of
discussion. The move will attract $20 billion to $30 billion by
mid-2013, Clemens Grafe, chief economist for Goldman Sachs in
Russia, said in a Moscow interview on Sept. 27. </p>
<p>Euroclear will make the Russian domestic bond market more
accessible to a wider range of investors, Natasha Smirnova,
who helps manage $4 billion of emerging-markets assets as a
product specialist at PineBridge Investments in London, said by
e-mail yesterday. This should result in a bigger, deeper bond
market over time. </p>
<h2>Central Depository </h2>
<p>While Mexican bonds have been traded through Euroclear
since 1995, Russia''s Justice Ministry last week registered an
order by the market watchdog listing the settlement systems
allowed to open nominal holder accounts with a central
depository. Trading via Euroclear may happen as soon as December
if a single depository is created by November, Stephan Pouyat,
head of Brussels-based Euroclear''s global product management,
said on Sept. 13. That timescale hasn''t changed, he said by e-mail yesterday. </p>
<p>Credit Suisse Group AG is the biggest seller this year of
structured notes at $587.8 million, followed by Citigroup with
$244.6 million and JPMorgan with $199.2 million, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Also known as credit-linked notes, the securities offer
higher yields and tailored maturities that may not be available
in the bond market. Investors suffer losses if there''s a default
either by the bank issuing the note or the reference entity. </p>
<p>Ruble bonds returned 3.8 percent in the third quarter,
compared with a 2.6 percent gain for Indian debt and a 0.5
percent decline for Chinese bonds, according to JPMorgan
indexes. Brazil''s bonds rallied 7.5 percent, the data show. </p>
<h2>Foreign Ownership </h2>
<p>VTB Capital said in July that the 6 percent of the OFZ
market owned by foreign investors may jump fivefold in the first
half of next year once the market opens up. The growth of the
OFZ market and impact on capital flows will depend on the level
of issuance by the Finance Ministry, Goldman''s Grafe said. </p>
<p>The $30 billion inflow from liberalization seems
realistic but it could take two to three years, Euroclear''s
Pouyat said yesterday. We have to look at it more as a catch-up compared to other emerging markets, as today the percentage
of foreign investors on OFZ is relatively low. Now, as for how
soon it will catch up, it all depends on how Russia as a country
will perform. </p>
<p>Russia''s Finance Ministry plans to sell as much as 335
billion rubles of so-called OFZ bonds in the fourth quarter, the
biggest three-month offering for at least a year. The government
is selling 130 billion rubles this month, starting with 25
billion rubles of 15-year notes tomorrow. </p>
<h2>Ruble Appreciation </h2>
<p>The ruble gained 3.6 percent versus the dollar in
September. It slid 0.2 percent to 31.1121 per dollar by 5:07
p.m. in Moscow. Non-deliverable forwards, which provide a guide
to expectations of currency movements, showed the ruble at
31.6010 per dollar in three months. </p>
<p>Russia is rated Baa1 by Moody''s Investors Service, the
third-lowest investment-grade ranking. Russian sovereign dollar
bonds due in April 2020 rose, lowering the yield by six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 2.685 percent. The yield on
domestically traded notes due in June 2017 lost three basis
points to 7.49 percent. The yield on Russia''s international
ruble bond due in March 2018 declined two basis points to 6.225
percent. </p>
<p>The cost of protecting Russian debt against non-payment for
five years using credit-default swaps fell two basis points to
142, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The swaps cost 13
basis points less than contracts for Turkey, which is rated
three levels lower at Ba1 by Moody''s. The contracts pay the
buyer face value in exchange for the underlying securities or
the cash equivalent should a government or company fail to
adhere to its debt agreements. </p>
<h2>Yield Gap </h2>
<p>The extra yield investors demand to hold Russian debt
rather than U.S. Treasuries dropped five basis points to 202,
according to JPMorgan EMBI Global indexes. The difference
compares with 165 for debt of similarly-rated Mexico and 153 for
Brazil, which is rated one step lower at Baa2 by Moody''s. </p>
<p>The yield on ruble government debt has fallen 67 basis
points from this year''s peak on June 4 to 7.25 percent as of
Sept. 28, compared with a decline of 63 basis points for
emerging markets to 5.80 percent, according to JPMorgan indexes. </p>
<p>Market liberalization could spur an increase in foreign
ownership of OFZ bonds to 20 percent from the current 6 percent,
according to Elena Kolchina, head of Renaissance Capital''s fixed
income group. Opening up the market could reduce yields by about
100 basis points over the next six months, she said yesterday in
e-mailed comments. </p>
<p>This trend could be sustained and not a short-term
rally, Kolchina said. It could last for years. </p>

<p>The New York lawsuit over mortgage-
backed securities filed Monday against JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) will
serve as a template for suits against other issuers, state
Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said. </p>
<p>Schneiderman alleged that the Bear Stearns business that
JPMorgan took over in 2008 deceived mortgage-bond investors
about the defective loans backing securities they bought,
leading to monumental losses, according to a complaint filed
yesterday in New York State Supreme Court. </p>
<p>The Bear Stearns mortgage unit packaged $212 billion in
mortgage bonds from 2003 through 2006, according to the
complaint. Losses on $87 billion of those bonds packaged during
just two of those years total $22.5 billion so far, it
estimated. Schneiderman said he wants the bank to disgorge all
money it obtained in connection with or as a result of the
alleged fraud. </p>
<p>This is a workable template for future actions against
issuers of residential mortgage-backed securities that defrauded
investors and cost millions of Americans their homes,
Schneiderman said in a statement. </p>
<p>New York hasn''t fully identified the losses in the JPMorgan
case, Schneiderman said yesterday in a teleconference. </p>
<p>Schneiderman is co-chairman of a state-federal group formed
to investigate misconduct in the bundling of mortgage loans into
securities leading up to the financial crisis. The group
includes officials from the Justice Department, the Securities
and Exchange Commission, the FBI and other federal and state
officials. </p>
<p>Joe Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, said the New York-
based bank would contest the complaint, which is entirely
about conduct by Bear Stearns. JPMorgan acquired Bear Stearns
in March 2008 after a run on what was then Wall Street''s fifth-
largest securities firm. </p>
<p>The case is People of the State of New York v. J.P. Morgan
Securities, 451556-2012, New York State Supreme Court, New York
County (Manhattan). </p>

<h2>Compliance Action </h2>
<h2>JPMorgan Joins BofA to End Card Adds-Ons as CFPB Cracks Down </h2>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., Bank of America Corp. and American
Express Co. (AXP) are among credit-card lenders retreating from a
$2.4 billion market as regulators seek curbs on deceptive
marketing of products including debt cancellation. </p>
<p>Scrutiny from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has
led to fines against banks including Capital One Financial Corp. (COF)
and Discover Financial Services (DFS), prompting them to curtail sales
of so-called add-ons that offer to help customers pay card bills
if they get sick or lose their jobs, or to monitor their credit. </p>
<p>American Express also is cooperating with regulators amid
an industrywide review of the products, said Michael
O''Neill, a spokesman for the New York-based lender. </p>
<p>AmEx, the biggest U.S. credit-card issuer by purchases,
said on Monday that it will pay $112.5 million to settle claims
it violated consumer safeguards from marketing to collections in
products sold to about 250,000 customers. That case didn''t
involve add-on products. </p>
<p>The crackdown is CFPB Director Richard Cordray''s first
enforcement campaign after the Dodd-Frank Act consolidated
regulation of retail financial products under one federal
agency. With U.S. banks already complaining that regulation has
squeezed revenue, the bureau is considering new limits on payday
lending and fees for checking overdrafts, and has proposed an
overhaul of mortgage practices. </p>

<h2>SEC Questions Revenue Disclosures of Real Estate Site Zillow </h2>
<p>Zillow Inc. (Z), the real estate website, fell yesterday after
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asked the company to
respond to questions about how it reported revenue. </p>
<p>Seattle-based Zillow declined 4.21 percent to $39.11 in New
York. Before the release of the SEC''s letter, the stock had
gained 82 percent this year. </p>
<p>The SEC asked in a letter dated Aug. 30 why the company
didn''t report the percentage increase in the average price paid
for so-called Premier Agent subscriptions in its most recent
financial report, according to a regulatory filing. Zillow said
it would revise disclosures in its next quarterly report,
according to the filing. </p>
<p>In addition, the SEC asked why total marketplace revenue
growth appears to be slowing while Premier Agent subscription
revenues look to be increasing. In response, Zillow said in the
filing that it would start disclosing the average monthly
Premier Agent revenue per subscriber. </p>
<p>This letter was in response to an early 2012 10-K filing
submitted by Zillow, and we have since responded to the SEC''s
satisfaction, Katie Curnutte, a Zillow spokeswoman, said in an
e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Separately, the SEC also asked Zillow to disclose the
number of unique users by domain name for different websites the
company operates, including Zillow.com and RentJuice.com,
according to a second letter released in a regulatory filing. </p>
<h2>Former Madoff Employees to Be Tried Next Year, Judge Says </h2>
<p>Five longtime employees of Bernard L. Madoff''s investment
firm will go to trial Oct. 7, 2013, charged with participating
in history''s biggest Ponzi scheme, a judge said. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain set the date
yesterday after the former Madoff employees, Daniel Bonventre,
Annette Bongiorno, Joann Crupi, Jerome O''Hara and George Perez,
pleaded not guilty to new charges. </p>
<p>Prosecutors in the office of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in
Manhattan on Oct. 1 filed a new indictment alleging the five
joined a conspiracy to defraud investors that got its start in
the early 1970s. The charges add to the 17 criminal counts filed
against the former employees in November 2010, for a total of 33
counts. </p>
<p>Bonventre, 65, and Bongiorno, 64, worked for Madoff for
40 years. Bongiorno rose to the level of supervisor and account
manager. Crupi, 51, an employee since 1983, tracked daily bank
account activity, prosecutors said. Perez, 46 and O''Hara, 49,
started at the firm in the early 1990s. </p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Lisa Baroni told Swain yesterday
that the prosecution case against the five will take about two
months. Swain said she will set aside 3 1/2 months for the
entire trial. </p>
<p>Madoff, 74, pleaded guilty to fraud in 2009 for cheating
investors out of $20 billion in principal. He is serving a 150-
year term in federal prison in North Carolina. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. O''Hara, 10-cr-00228, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<h2>Florida Man Pleads Guilty to Phony Facebook Share Scam </h2>
<p>A South Florida man charged with running an $11 million
scam involving nonexistent shares in companies including
Facebook Inc. (FB) and Groupon Inc. (GRPN) was taken into custody after
pleading guilty to criminal charges. </p>
<p>John Mattera, 50, who operated Praetorian Global Fund Ltd.,
pleaded guilty yesterday in Manhattan to three criminal counts
-- conspiracy, securities fraud and wire fraud -- and tried to
plead guilty to a fourth, money laundering. U.S. District Judge
Richard Sullivan declined Mattera''s request to remain free on
bail, ordering him jailed after a two-hour hearing. </p>
<p>In a plea agreement, Mattera and prosecutors said federal
sentencing guidelines call for a term of 10 to more than
12 years in prison. Sullivan may disregard the guidelines in
sentencing Mattera. </p>
<p>In the SEC case, U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel in New
York found that Mattera sold a Lamborghini automobile for
$28,000, which he passed to his mother, in violation of a court-
ordered asset freeze. Mattera also borrowed $114,000 and
transferred money to his mother to pay his expenses, also in
violation of the order, Castel said. </p>
<p>Carl Schoeppl, Mattera''s lawyer, declined to comment on the
case after the hearing. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Mattera, 11-CR-2947, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<h2>Courts </h2>
<h2>Morgan Stanley Loses Appeal in $245 Million Citigroup Suit </h2>
<p>A federal appeals court in Manhattan upheld a ruling
against Morgan Stanley  Co. (MS) in a breach-of-contract suit in
which it''s accused of failing to pay a Citigroup Inc. (C) unit
$245 million under a swap agreement. </p>
<p>Citibank NA arranged the swap for protection in the event
that a collateralized debt obligation based on a line of credit
provided to an entity called Capmark defaulted, according to the
ruling yesterday. </p>
<p>Citibank sued in 2009, alleging that Morgan Stanley refused
to pay the shortfall owed under the swap after Capmark defaulted
on its loan agreements and the $366 million CDO was liquidated.
In 2011, U.S. District Judge Shira A. Scheindlin ordered Morgan
Stanley to pay $245 million plus interest. </p>
<p>The appeals court rejected Morgan Stanley''s argument that
it wasn''t obligated to pay because Citibank NA ordered the CDO
liquidated without Morgan Stanley''s permission. </p>
<p>Lauren Onis, a spokeswoman for New York-based Morgan
Stanley, declined to comment on the appeals court ruling. </p>
<p>We are pleased with the decision of the Second Circuit of
Appeals affirming the judgment in our favor, Danielle Romero-
Apsilos, a spokeswoman for New York-based Citigroup, said in an
e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>The case is Citibank N.A. v. Morgan Stanley  Co.
International Plc, 11-2592, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit (Manhattan). </p>
<h2>U.S. Role in Lehman Collapse Allowed in Reserve Trial </h2>
<p>The U.S. government''s role in the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. will be allowed as evidence in the Oct. 9
trial over allegations that Reserve Primary Fund misled
investors in 2008, a federal judge in Manhattan ruled. </p>
<p>The company will be permitted to present evidence that its
confidence in Lehman''s finances were based in part on the U.S.
Securities Exchange Commission''s oversight of the investment
bank under a voluntary regulatory program, according to the
decision by U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe. </p>
<p>A trial is scheduled to begin Oct. 9 in the SEC''s case
alleging that the company misled investors about the safety of
the fund after it suffered losses in Lehman investments. The
fund, which held $785 million in debt issued by Lehman, became
the first money fund in 14 years to expose investors to losses
when Lehman filed for bankruptcy protection in September 2008. </p>
<p>Defendants intend to argue that Bent Sr. believed that
Lehman''s financial reports were sound, and this belief was
critical to his state of mind on September 15 and 16, Gardephe
said in his ruling, referring to Reserve Partners founder and
Chief Executive Officer Bruce R. Bent, a defendant along with
his son, Bruce Bent II. </p>
<p>The judge excluded evidence regarding government actions
following Lehman''s bankruptcy filing and the beginning of
Reserve Primary Fund''s collapse, including government bailout
programs and the SEC''s investigation of Lehman and other
financial firms. </p>
<p>John Dellaportas, a lawyer for the defendants, and SEC
attorney Nancy A. Brown didn''t immediately return calls for
comment on the ruling. </p>
<p>The case is SEC v. Reserve Management Co. Inc. 09-cv-
04346, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>
<h2>Playboy Enterprises to Settle Investor Case for $5 Million </h2>
<p>Playboy Enterprises Inc. agreed to pay $5.25 million to
settle a lawsuit over claims its founder, Hugh M. Hefner,
shortchanged investors in a going-private buyout in March. </p>
<p>Stockholders sued beginning in 2010 over the offer, which
started at $5.50 a share and increased to $6.15 a share the
following year. The parties agreed to the settlement partly to
avoid continued litigation, according to Delaware Chancery Court
papers made public yesterday in Wilmington. Playboy, based in
Chicago, denied any wrongdoing. </p>
<p>Plaintiffs'' counsel have concluded that the settlement is
fair and adequate and that it is reasonable, the parties wrote
in their memorandum. The agreement requires a judge''s approval. </p>
<p>Playboy expanded globally in the 1960s and 1970s when
Hefner, now 86, ran the company. The company went public in 1971
and circulation reached 7.2 million for one issue in 1972.
Hefner is the company''s chief creative officer. </p>
<p>Teri Thomerson, a spokeswoman for Playboy, and plaintiffs''
lawyer Carmella Keener didn''t immediately respond to e-mail
messages seeking comment on the settlement. </p>
<p>The case is In Re Playboy Enterprises Inc. Shareholders
Litigation, CA5632-VCN, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). </p>
<h2>ResCap Mortgage Holders Seek Details on Servicing Unit Sale </h2>
<p>Residential Capital LLC, the bankrupt mortgage unit of Ally
Financial Inc. (ALLY), should be barred from selling its loan servicing
unit until the company provides more information about the deal,
investors who bought ResCap mortgages said in court papers. </p>
<p>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government-chartered
mortgage buyers, on Monday objected to the sale, claiming that
without changes the proposed deal may threaten contracts they
have with ResCap to service loans. </p>
<p>The unit being sold collects payments and provides
foreclosure services on more than 1 million loans Fannie and
Freddie bought from ResCap. Because they own a large share of
the 2.4 million loans that ResCap services, the two mortgage
holders said in court papers filed in Manhattan, they expected
ResCap to be more cooperative. </p>
<p>ResCap, based in New York, filed for bankruptcy in May with
plans to sell most of its assets and resolve legal claims
related to residential mortgage-backed securities. </p>
<p>The company said last month that it is working to resolve
objections to the proposed sale. </p>
<p>ResCap plans to hold an auction for the mortgage servicing
business, with a unit of Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG) as the
lead bidder. The unit, Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc. (NSM), has
agreed to buy the servicing business for more than $2.4 billion
unless it is outbid. </p>
<p>In separate filings, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac said they
would support the sale if ResCap and the winning bidder provide
enough information to ensure that their servicing contracts are
not disrupted. </p>
<p>The case is In re Residential Capital LLC, 12-12020, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<h2>Speeches and Conferences </h2>
<h2>SEC Holds Conference on Trading Technology and Crisis Management </h2>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday held

<h2>Miliband Seeks Tighter U.K. Merger Rules Against Predators'' </h2>
<p>U.K. opposition leader Ed Miliband pledged to tighten
takeover rules and end quarterly reporting for companies, saying
that would encourage longer-term thinking and businesses that
are producers rather than predators. </p>
<p>In his keynote speech yesterday to his Labour Party''s
annual conference in Manchester, England, Miliband laid claim to
the one nation model of politics defined by Conservative
Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli in 1872 and said banks and
other businesses should be bound to similar tenets. He said
David Cameron, the current Tory leader and premier, had
abandoned one nation policies. </p>
<p>Miliband said Labour is now the party best able to
represent people of all backgrounds and incomes, and that recent
British governments, including those headed by Labour''s Tony
Blair and Gordon Brown, in which he was a minister, failed to
hold the powerful to account. </p>

<p>A feature in the newest version of Microsoft Corp.

It was signed by top marketing and sales executives at more than three dozen companies, including Coca-Cola Co. (KO), Ford Motor Co. (F), Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) and American Express Co. (AXP) </p> <p>Microsoft plans to include Internet Explorer 10 with Windows 8, the latest version of its personal computer operating system that will be released later this month. The move reduces choices for consumers using the browser, which has a 43 percent market share in the U.S., the trade group said. </p> <p>If Microsoft moves forward with this default setting, it will undercut the effectiveness of our members'' advertising and, as a result, drastically damage the online experience by reducing the Internet content and offerings that such advertising supports, the trade group said in the letter, which was posted on its website. This result will harm consumers, hurt competition, and undermine American innovation and leadership in the Internet economy. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)''s full-length,
Hollywood-style movie based on the next Halo video game will
skip the big screen, streaming instead on Google Inc. (GOOG)''s YouTube
before heading to store shelves as a DVD. </p>
<p>The Redmond, Washington-based maker of the Xbox console,
promoting the November release of Halo 4, has taken the
unusual step of creating its own 90-minute movie, at a cost of
almost $10 million. </p>
<p>Microsoft plans to release weekly installments of Halo 4:
Forward Unto Dawn on the Web before offering the game and DVD,
a move that highlights the influence of new media, including
promotional options and the ability to cut out traditional
channels like theaters. The film airs starting tomorrow in five
15-minute segments on the YouTube channel Machinima Prime,
leading up to the game''s debut on Nov. 6. </p>
<p>We''re either the best-funded Web series of all time, a
sort of mid-road healthy TV pilot, or a super-low budget
movie, director Stewart Hendler said in an interview. </p>
<p>The clips of Forward Unto Dawn will stay online through
Nov. 23, then disappear until Dec. 4, when a Blu-ray disc goes
on sale that includes an added 15 minutes, for a suggested
$28.99. The film will also be available for download from Apple
Inc. (AAPL)''s iTunes, Microsoft''s Zune Marketplace and other online
movie stores. </p>
<p>Microsoft almost didn''t make a Halo movie. In 2006, the
company shelved plans for a live-action theatrical release with
Universal Pictures and Twentieth Century Fox over financial
concerns, Variety reported at the time. The trade publication
put the budget at $135 million. </p>
<h2>Seasoned Director </h2>
<p>After the stumbles in Hollywood, Microsoft began financing
and distributing short videos and animated films online, while
selling rights to make novels and comic books based on Halo.
For Forward Unto Dawn, the company hired Hendler, whose
directing credits include the horror movies Sorority Row and
Whisper, and developed a script based on one of the novels
and tied to the pending game. </p>
<p>While the production team hired the actors, Microsoft
retained final say, including the decision not to use Steve
Downes, according to Matt McCloskey, a Microsoft business
director who manages Halo''s development. Downes'' distinctive
voice as Master Chief in the games is known to legions of
Halo fans. </p>
<p>New Window? </p>
<p>By self-producing a movie and then releasing it both online
and through traditional home-video outlets, Microsoft has carved
a new distribution path, Laura Martin, a media analyst at
Needham  Co., said in an interview. YouTube and other streaming
sites traditionally show short-form video. </p>
<p>They''re basically replicating the traditional film-window
strategy of movie to home video, but they''re releasing it on the
Web, Martin said. With this experiment, they''ve now given us
another window into, What does the premium online content
market look like?'' </p>
<p>At least two movies, Girl Walks Into a Bar and The
Princess of Nebraska, made their debuts online before moving
to home video, according to Chris Dale, a spokesman for Mountain
view, California-based Google. Consumers who buy a limited
edition of the game will receive a free download of the movie on
their Xbox, McCloskey said, a tie-in that highlights the
marketing possibilities for other videos tied to games. </p>
<p>Produced over five weeks last spring in Vancouver, the
movie tells the story of an alien invasion that occurs 25 years
before the original Halo video game, with a new hero called
Thomas Lasky and appearances by Master Chief, the protagonist in
previous games. Actor Daniel Cudmore, who played Colossus in two
X-Men movies, dons the armored suit of Master Chief. </p>
<h2>Top Franchise </h2>
<p>The Web world is making everybody that works within it
think outside the normal pattern of film development, Hendler
said. </p>
<p>Microsoft, which released the first Halo title in
November 2001, rose 0.6 percent to $30.03 at the close in New
York. The shares have gained 16 percent this year. </p>
<p>Halo, exclusive to the Xbox, ranks among the 10
largest-grossing video-game franchises of all time, selling tens
of millions of copies, according to Michael Pachter, an analyst
at Wedbush Securities. The franchise has generated more than $3
billion in revenue, according to Microsoft. </p>
<p>Microsoft has a lot at stake with the next installment,
said Pachter, who is based in Los Angeles. Halo 4 is the
first title in the franchise to be developed by 343 Industries,
the Microsoft-owned studio that was tapped in 2007 to oversee
the property after its creator, Bungie Studios, became
independent and signed a 10-year publishing deal with Activision
Blizzard Inc. (ATVI) </p>
<p>With Halo 4 and the accompanying movie, 343 Industries
aims to draw a broader science-fiction audience, Microsoft''s
McCloskey said. </p>
<p>You see something that looks like a video game, you''re
going to get the same crowd you always get, McCloskey said.
The movie is not simply a marketing vehicle, though. It is in
and of itself a standalone property. </p>
<p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Rakteem Katakey and Jim Polson" date="Oct 04, 2012  2:31 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-04/exxon-bp-estimate-alaska-lng-export-project-at-65-billion.html"><headline>Exxon, BP Estimate Alaska LNG Export Project at $65 Billion</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), ConocoPhillips, BP
Plc (BP/) and TransCanada Corp. said a project to liquefy and export
natural gas from Alaska will cost as much as $65 billion and
take more than 10 years to construct. </p>
<p>The venture includes an 800-mile (1,300-kilometer) pipeline
from the North Slope to Alaska''s southern coast as well as a
liquefaction plant and storage tanks, the companies said in an
Oct. 1 letter received by Alaskan Governor Sean Parnell''s office
yesterday. The governor had asked the companies to harden the
numbers on the project by the end of September, Parnell said
in a statement. </p>
<p>As oil output from the North Slope has dropped, energy
companies and Alaska''s government are seeking ways to sell the
area''s gas, which may generate as much as $20 billion in annual
revenue as demand from Asia increases. The North Slope may hold
35 trillion cubic feet of reserves and more than 200 trillion
cubic feet of undiscovered, technically recoverable gas, making
it one of the largest sources in the world, according to the
governor. </p>
<p>This will be a game-changer for global LNG trade because
it will be one of the largest projects ever, Dan Sullivan,
Alaska''s natural resources commissioner, said today in a
telephone interview. Plans call for exports of 3.5 billion cubic
feet of natural gas per day, he said. Knowing this project has
to compete globally, we''ll be working with these companies to
make this the most cost-competitive project there is. </p>
<h2>Mega-Project'' </h2>
<p>The pipeline and liquefaction facility would be a mega-
project of unprecedented scale and challenge, executives of
Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips (COP), BP and TransCanada said in the
letter to Parnell. The opportunity is challenged by its cost,
scale, long project lead times and reliance upon independent oil
and gas operations with declining production. </p>
<p>BP and ConocoPhillips joined with TransCanada and Exxon
after deciding last year to halt a competing $35 billion
pipeline proposal known as Denali. The companies are cooperating
with a smaller state-backed pipeline project which would deliver
North Slope gas to Alaska customers. </p>
<p>The bigger project, which will also include a plant to
remove carbon dioxide from the gas and marine facilities, would
require 1.7 million metric tons of steel and as many as 15,000
people at peak construction, the companies said. The venture
would compete with global supplies of liquefied natural gas, or
LNG, coming into the market in the next 20 years from Australia,
East Africa, the U.S. Gulf Coast and Canada. </p>
<h2>TransCanada''s Role </h2>
<p>TransCanada (TRP) will build the North Slope pipeline to carry
gas to the export terminals. </p>
<p>I''m encouraged that the companies have made significant
progress in advancing a project and an associated schedule,
Parnell said in the statement. They have fully shifted their
efforts to an Alaska LNG project. </p>
<p>The companies have yet to make a final decision on whether
to proceed with the project. Design, engineering and
construction may take 10-and-a-half years, barring permitting
and financing delays, the companies said. </p>
<p>Alaska agreed to incentives should the final decision to
build the project be completed in 2016, Sullivan said in today''s
interview. Based on the timeline submitted yesterday, that would
peg first shipments in 2021 or 2022, he said. </p>
<h2>Reimbursing TransCanada </h2>
<p>The state has agreed to reimburse TransCanada $500 million
for development costs, he said. Other incentives might include
expedited permitting, tax breaks or state-backed low-interest
financing, Sullivan added. </p>
<p>This is good progress, Sullivan said. Alaska is fully
motivated to keep the pedal to the metal on it. </p>
<p>The companies made clear in their letter that they want
signed LNG sales and shipping agreements before making a final
decision to proceed with the project, Sullivan said. The
arrangement would be similar to other global LNG works. </p>
<p>The initial cost estimate is $45 billion to $65 billion.
Estimated cost by Chevron Corp. (CVX) for the Gorgon liquefied natural
gas project off Australia, scheduled for first shipments in
2014, is $45 billion. Deutsche Bank AG estimated Sept. 14 Gorgon
may cost A$50 billion ($51.3 billion). </p>
<p>Plans to export gas from the North Slope come as companies
are proposing to build LNG facilities on Canada''s West Coast to
send the fuel to Asia. Apache Corp. (APA)''s Kitimat LNG project, which
has Encana Corp. (ECA) and EOG Resources Inc. (EOG) as partners, is
estimated to cost $15 billion for the plant, pipeline and wells. </p>
<p>Increased production from shale-gas resources in the U.S.
has also led to proposals to export LNG from facilities on the
Gulf Coast. </p>
<p>Alaska, the only U.S. state operating an LNG export plant,
is seeking to parlay its more than 40-year history of sending
fuel to Asia from ConocoPhillips''s terminal near Kenai into an
advantage for expanding shipments. </p>
<p>The state''s coast provides one of the closest routes to
Asian markets, potentially giving it lower shipping costs than
competing projects from western Canada, Robert Brooks, founder
of RBAC Inc., an energy data company, said in an interview
before yesterday''s announcement. </p>
<h2>Asian Demand </h2>
<p>Asian demand will lead a 17 percent increase in global gas
demand by 2017 from 2011, the International Energy Agency
forecast in June. China''s annual gas consumption will more than
double to 273 billion cubic meters in the period, the IEA said.

<p>Morgan Stanley reiterated its call for gold, silver and copper to outperform other metals as investor demand and central-bank buying bolsters bullion and supply constraints benefit the raw material used in wires. </p> <p>Central bank policies ensure conditions remain favorable for continued price appreciation for both gold and its cheaper proxy, silver, analysts Peter Richardson and Joel Crane wrote in a report today. The bank expects gold to average $1,683 an ounce this year, rising to $1,853 in 2013. Morgan Stanley also remained bearish on aluminum, nickel, lead and zinc. </p> <p>Commodities as tracked by the Standard  Poor''s GSCI Spot Index rose 11 percent last quarter in the best such performance since March 2011, as central banks in the U.S., Japan, China and Europe, took action to support their economies. Gold is rallying for a 12th year as central banks join investors buying bullion to diversify assets. South Korea and Kazakhstan are among those who added to gold reserves this year. Holdings in exchange- traded products tracked by Bloomberg are at a record. </p> <p>Central banks'' expansionary monetary policies, with all their attendant inflation and currency debasement risks, are a game changer for gold, Morgan Stanley said. Central banks have further underpinned the likelihood of continued growth in investment demand by emphasizing their own liking for gold as a reserve portfolio asset. </p> <p>The Bank of Japan (8301) said Sept. 19 it will expand a fund that buys assets following the U.S. Federal Reserve''s announcement of a third round of so-called quantitative easing, or QE, by buying $40 billion of mortgage-backed securities a month. The European Central Bank also gave details last month of a program to buy debt of member states. </p> <h2>Goldman, Copper </h2> <p>Gold for immediate delivery traded at $1,788.91 at 1 p.m. in London, and has averaged $1,654.68 this year, according to data tracked by Bloomberg. Copper may average $3.63 a pound this year and $3.90 in 2013, the report said. Copper futures in New York traded at $3.8045, and have averaged $3.6196 in 2012. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. expects aggressive quantitative easing to be the most bullish for copper due to the metal''s relatively robust fundamentals, it said in an Oct. 2 report. Copper was seen by 34 percent of about 160 Credit Suisse Group AG clients as having the best 12-month outlook, the bank said in a Sept. 18 survey. </p> <p>Global industrial output may grow by 3.6 percent in 2012 and by 4 percent in 2013, Morgan Stanley said. China''s industrialization is passing into a more mature phase of lower annual gross domestic product growth as the economy rebalances, with reduced rates of raw-material demand expansion, it said. </p> <h2>China Growth </h2> <p>Growth in China''s gross domestic product decelerated to a three-year low of 7.6 percent in the last quarter. Policy makers have taken steps to shield the economy hurt by the debt crisis in Europe. China''s central bank cut interest rates in July, after lowering lenders'' reserve requirement ratio three times from November to May, and the government last month approved additional infrastructure spending. </p> <p>Chinese growth has already slowed well beyond the comfort levels of many commodity investors, and a prolonged extension of this trend would likely send most commodity markets into significant oversupply, the analysts wrote. The euro zone sovereign debt crisis continues to represent the single most significant downside risk. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Dawn Kopecki and Bradley Keoun" date="Oct 05, 2012  3:44 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-05/jpmorgan-s-zubrow-to-retire-after-getting-new-boss-zames.html"><headline>JPMorgan''s Zubrow to Retire in Wake of CIO''s Trading Loss</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s Barry Zubrow,
who oversaw risk management while the bank amassed credit-
derivative bets that led to a multibillion-dollar trading loss,
will retire at the end of this year. </p>
<p>Now is the right time in my life to retire, Zubrow, 59,
wrote to colleagues in a note today. We have learned from the
mistakes of our recent trading losses. The contents of the
note were confirmed by Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for the New
York-based bank. </p>
<p>Zubrow was chief risk officer from November 2007 until
January, as bank personnel were evaluating changes to the
computer-based mathematical models used to measure the potential
for trading losses. The changes, which took effect in mid-
January, made risks in the firm''s chief investment office look
smaller than they were, fueling losses that reached $5.8 billion
as of June. </p>
<p>Since January, Zubrow was head of corporate and regulatory
affairs, where he lobbied the Federal Reserve and other
regulators for looser controls on proprietary traders in the
CIO. </p>
<p>In a management shuffle in July, JPMorgan Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon moved Zubrow from reporting directly to him
to reporting to 41-year-old Matt Zames, who was promoted to co-
chief operating officer. </p>
<h2>Thoughtful Counsel'' </h2>
<p>Dimon said in a separate memo to staff today that he had
benefited from Zubrow''s thoughtful counsel and analysis. </p>
<p>Zubrow, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive who was
hired by Dimon in 2007, also was the brother-in-law of Irv Goldman, who was appointed chief risk officer of the chief
investment office in February. Goldman, 52, had been fired in
2007 by Cantor Fitzgerald LP for money-losing bets that led to a
regulatory sanction of that firm, Bloomberg News reported on May
20. </p>
<p>It was during Goldman''s watch that Bruno Iksil, a CIO
trader in London, put on the trades that Dimon later called
egregious. Less than a week after the loss became public,
the bank stripped Goldman of those duties. </p>
<p>While the losses mostly occurred this year, the trades that
went wrong were designed to hedge other positions built up in
2011, according to Michael Cavanagh, a senior executive at the
bank who led an internal inquiry into the cause of the losses. </p>
<p>Ina Drew, who was the bank''s chief investment officer,
resigned in May after the losses were disclosed. </p>
<p>Zubrow''s retirement was previously reported by the Wall
Street Journal. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s $5.8 billion
trading loss this year showed that the financial system is
getting too complicated for even respected institutions, the
president of China''s sovereign-wealth fund said. </p>
<p>You are creating a system that very few people
understand, much less the regulators because the regulators
haven''t the incentives like the bankers, Gao Xiqing, president
of China Investment Corp., said today at a lunch hosted by the
Economic Club of New York. As a former regulator I think we do
need to slow down a little bit instead of rushing up to all
those fancy derivatives. </p>
<p>Gao, who said he was speaking in a personal capacity and
not in his role at the CIC, said the loss attributed to a trader
known as the London Whale was especially instructive because it
happened at a bank he holds in high regard and wasn''t the result
of a rogue employee. New York-based JPMorgan, the biggest U.S.
bank by assets, lost the money because of derivatives held by
its chief investment office. </p>
<p>That single thing was most revealing to me at least
because I respect this institution JPMorgan very much, he
said. We believe in their risk management, we believe in the
fact that they''re being cautious. </p>
<p>He expressed concern about a society in which all the
best engineers are engineering financial products. </p>
<p>You have all the smartest kids to design these products,
the only purpose of which is to get money out of other people''s
pockets, he said. That is not very good. </p>
<p>Gao said he tries to avoid relying on financial models in
his own investments because he doesn''t trust them. </p>
<p>CIC is an investor in Morgan Stanley (MS), the sixth-biggest
U.S. bank, which competes with JPMorgan. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s biggest
drugmaker, was asked by U.S. regulators how it recorded high
profit overseas and losses at home when 40 percent of its sales
were inside the U.S. </p>
<p>In a May 9 letter filed today, Securities and Exchange
Commission staff asked New York-based Pfizer to explain why
earnings before taxes outside the U.S. were $15 billion in 2011
while losses within the country were $2.2 billion. By piling up
profit in low-tax jurisdictions overseas, Pfizer has been able
to cut its tax rate reported to investors and boost results. </p>
<p>These operating results appear to be inconsistent with
your domestic and international revenues, which in 2011 were
$26.9 billion and $40.5 billion, respectively, wrote Jim Rosenberg, the commission''s senior assistant chief accountant. </p>
<p>Pfizer is one of the most aggressive U.S. companies
reporting income in countries with lower tax rates than the U.S.
as a way of reducing their effective tax rate, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The drugmaker had the second-highest
amount of profit kept overseas, $63 billion, behind only General
Electric Co., according to securities filings as of March. </p>
<p>Pfizer is among the companies that have lobbied U.S.
lawmakers for a tax holiday that would allow it to bring some of
the overseas profit back to the country at a lower tax rate.
Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, argued for
such a holiday in his Oct. 3 debate with President Barack Obama. </p>
<h2>Not Helpful </h2>
<p>In its response to regulators, Pfizer wrote that giving
more information about how it distributed its earnings among
various locations wouldn''t be helpful to investors. </p>
<p>The geographical mix of revenues is not a good indicator
of the split between domestic and international pretax earnings
for purposes of financial statement presentation, especially for
a multinational company that manages its operations on a global
basis, wrote Loretta V. Cangialosi, Pfizer''s controller. </p>
<p>We do not believe that disclosure regarding the reasons
for the geographical split of pretax earnings would be
meaningful or useful to investors, she wrote on May 22. </p>
<p>In 2009, according to the correspondence, Pfizer cut 9.4
percent from its tax rate by designating profit as overseas. And
in 2011 the company reduced the rate 3.3 percent. </p>
<p>Pfizer is slimming down by divesting its animal health and
infant nutrition units to focus on producing new medicines to
replace revenue from its best-selling cholesterol pill Lipitor,
which until it lost patent protection last year was the top drug
in the world with about $9.6 billion in 2011 sales. </p>
<p>Pfizer has paid all the taxes it is legally obligated to,
said Joan Campion, a company spokeswoman. </p>
<h2>150 Countries </h2>
<p>We conduct business in more than 150 countries and face
significant competition from companies located outside the
United States, including many competitors located in lower tax
jurisdictions, Campion said in an e-mail. At all times and
wherever we operate, Pfizer complies with the appropriate tax
law. </p>
<p>Pfizer said in an Aug. 27 letter that it would add more
disclosure, including a line saying, the jurisdictional
location of earnings is a significant component of our effective
tax rate each year as tax rates outside of the U.S. are
generally lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate. The
company would also explain how tax breaks in Ireland, Singapore
and Puerto Rico lower its rates. </p>
<p>We believe the disclosures provided are sufficient and
have received a response from the SEC that it has no further
comments on those filings, Campion said. </p>
<p>Pfizer is not alone in getting these questions from the
SEC. In December, the commission questioned Google about its
earnings in other countries. </p>
<p>Florence Harmon, a spokeswoman for the SEC, declined to
comment. </p>

<p>New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman''s fraud lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase  Co. for
the misdeeds that occurred at Bear Stearns Cos. has sent exactly
the wrong message to Wall Street: Don''t worry, you can get away
with seemingly criminal behavior. </p>
<p>And yet JPMorgan -- the bank that bought the stock of Bear
Stearns in March 2008 with a $30 billion assist from the U.S.
government -- is offended. The suit alleges that Bear Stearns''s
bankers and traders manufactured and sold about $20 billion of
mortgage-backed securities containing home loans they knew were
fraudulent. What JPMorgan objects to is that the government
asked it to buy Bear Stearns over the course of a weekend to
help keep the financial system from collapsing, and now, more
than four years later, it has the temerity to sue. </p>
<p>I can imagine Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan (JPM)''s chief executive
officer, saying: If this is the thanks we get, you can pretty
much be assured that next time you ask us to save a failing
systemically important institution, we''ll just walk away. </p>
<p>Methinks the bank doth protest too much. JPMorgan didn''t
buy Bear Stearns as a favor to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson,
New York Fed President Timothy Geithner and Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke; it bought Bear Stearns because it saw an
opportunity to acquire on the cheap a company with assets it
coveted. JPMorgan admired Bear Stearns''s clearing business, its
commodities trading, a few of its bankers and traders and, most
of all, its sleek, new skyscraper at 383 Madison Avenue, across
the street from JPMorgan headquarters at 270 Park Avenue. </p>
<h2>First Offer </h2>
<p>Pretty much from the start of that fateful weekend in
March, JPMorgan knew that there was no serious competition for
Bear Stearns. And that wasn''t because the government had
handpicked Dimon to save the company. Dimon''s first offer was $8
to $12 a share, a two-thirds discount to Bear Stearns''s closing
price of about $30 a share that Friday. Bear Stearns''s
management was incredulous that Dimon would make such a low
offer. So the JPMorgan CEO lowered it even further. Then, on
Sunday morning, Dimon''s representatives told Bear Stearns''s
executives that he was walking away from the deal altogether. </p>
<p>That''s when panic erupted and Paulson, working behind the
scenes, got Dimon to agree to buy Bear Stearns for $2 a share if
the government took $30 billion of squirrelly assets that
JPMorgan didn''t want. The $2-a-share deal was announced Sunday
night. Dimon had paid less for the equity of Bear Stearns than
the market value of the building at 383 Madison. JPMorgan soon
scrapped plans to erect a new building downtown for its
investment-banking operations, which were moved instead across
the street to the former Bear Stearns digs. (The purchase price
for Bear Stearns was later increased to $10 a share supposedly
because of a legal drafting error; who precisely was to blame
for that mess or how it happened has never been made clear.) </p>
<p>In doing a stock-for-stock deal for Bear Stearns, JPMorgan
not only bought all of the bank''s assets -- except for the $30
billion taken by the New York Fed -- but it also took over its
liabilities, including its debt and its lawsuits, both the known
ones and those to come. JPMorgan knew that it would be held
responsible for the bad behavior that led Bear Stearns to the
brink of disaster and viewed that potential liability as just
another cost of the deal. (Bank of America Corp. faced the same
predicament -- only much worse -- in its acquisitions of
Countrywide Financial Corp. and Merrill Lynch  Co.) </p>
<p>For JPMorgan to complain about Schneiderman''s suit, even
though this was one of the risks it agreed to take in the March
2008 merger agreement with Bear Stearns, is beyond ridiculous;
it''s simply spin. </p>
<h2>Deceptive Acts'' </h2>
<p>That isn''t the worst of it. What makes Schneiderman''s suit
against JPMorgan a total yawner on Wall Street is that the
attorney general failed to bring criminal charges against
JPMorgan for the doings at Bear Stearns. How Schneiderman could
let the bank off so easily when the complaint itself claims that
Bear Stearns committed multiple fraudulent and deceptive acts
in promoting and selling its mortgage-backed securities is an
utter mystery. If those aren''t criminal offenses under
securities law, could someone please tell me what is? </p>
<p>The complaint describes repeated bad behavior at Bear
Stearns, including a now-infamous e-mail that describes one
securitization deal in the most vulgar of scatological terms.
Those e-mails alone make clear that Bear Stearns executives knew
that they were packaging and selling a load of junk to
investors. </p>
<p>It''s also clear that after March 15, 2008, JPMorgan knew it
would be legally responsible for that bad behavior. The lawsuit
will probably be settled shortly -- I would guess for about $100
million -- and Schneiderman will no doubt sue other Wall Street
firms for similar reasons. He will extract fines out of them,
too, and fill New York state''s coffers. </p>
<p>Yet he missed a chance to change the behavior on Wall
Street by his decision not to make the criminal case against
Bear Stearns and its owner, JPMorgan. A $100 million fine?
That''s a joke for JPMorgan and an unneeded cost for the bank''s
shareholders and its insurance carrier. Bear Stearns was picked
up for a song, in what still ranks as one of the savviest
business deals of the past decade. Schneiderman blew it. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) agreed to
pay $6.75 million to eight U.S. exchanges to settle claims over
the way it handled options trades from January 2004 through May
2010, according to a document on the Chicago Board Options
Exchange''s website. </p>
<p>The New York-based securities firm mislabeled certain
options orders as originating with customers instead of brokers
or market makers, potentially giving them access to preferential
treatment, according to a letter of consent. Goldman Sachs,
which was censured by the exchanges, neither admitted nor denied
wrongdoing. </p>
<p>The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which oversees
more than 4,300 brokers, has been assessing how firms categorize
orders in sweeps it is conducting to ensure they are complying
with rules, Richard Ketchum, chairman and chief executive
officer of Finra, said at a conference in Washington on Sept.
20. Mismarking orders affects the execution priority given to
users, the official audit trail of executions, and the fees paid
to exchanges, he said. </p>
<p>Historically, traders have attempted to get better
pricing from exchanges by representing someone as a customer,
Stephen Solaka, a former CBOE member who oversees about $60
million including options as co-founder of Belmont Capital Group
in Los Angeles, said in a phone interview. The exchanges are
competing for customer order flow and would bend over a little
more for a customer than they would for a market maker. </p>
<h2>Different Categories </h2>
<p>Buy and sell requests from market makers, brokers, public
customers and professionals are treated differently by many
exchanges, with those from customers usually executing before
others. The fees exchanges charge may vary based on the type of
company or individual submitting the order. Goldman Sachs
employed two order-entry systems that failed to identify the
source of options orders, according to the disciplinary action. </p>
<p>We''re pleased to have settled these matters, Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, said by phone. </p>
<p>The G2 and Stride systems Goldman Sachs employed were
deficient because they didn''t allow users to select different
codes to identify the orders properly, the document said. The
Stride system coded all orders as coming from customers. Some
orders may have received priority in transactions over others
because they were mislabeled, the document said. </p>
<h2>Supervisory Systems </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs failed to maintain supervisory systems and
controls that were reasonably designed to achieve compliance
with exchange rules, the CBOE document said. The broker also
didn''t immediately fix its coding deficiencies when problems
were identified by its employees on several occasions, the
letter of consent said. </p>
<p>Nasdaq Options Market said in its disciplinary action that
Goldman Sachs''s compliance, equity derivative sales and sales
technology groups didn''t communicate adequately about the
development of G2 and Stride. System developers also didn''t
understand the broker''s client base for options, contributing to
deficiencies in the order-entry platforms, it said. </p>
<p>CBOE, the largest U.S. options exchange, will get $3.75
million of the total fine, CBOE Holdings Inc. (CBOE) said. The other
exchanges include the International Securities Exchange, Nasdaq
Options Market, Nasdaq OMX PHLX, NYSE Amex Options, NYSE Arca
Options, Bats Options and BOX Options Exchange, according to the
document. ISE said in a separate notice it will get $1.1 million
of the total amount. </p>
<h2>Reimbursement Payments </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs separately reimbursed exchanges for the
difference between the fees it paid to trade on their venues and
what it owed them, CBOE said. ISE said the broker paid almost
$900,000 in uncollected fees for improperly marking orders as
coming from customers instead of brokers or market makers. ISE
in New York is owned by Frankfurt-based Deutsche Boerse AG. </p>
<p>Finra''s focus on the labeling of options orders is part of
a broader review of controls brokers employ to ensure that buy
and sell requests are properly identified. The private-sector
regulator has uncovered a large number of firms that are
either misreporting positions or not reporting them at all,
flouting obligations concerning their so-called large-options
positions, Ketchum said in September. </p>
<p>The misuse of market-maker exemptions for firms that must
otherwise locate shares before engaging in short sales is
another area of investigation, Ketchum said. Finra is probing
excessive quotation message traffic caused by algorithms and
enhancing its examination and market surveillance programs to
uncover manipulative activity, he said. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) can''t avoid liability
for any inaccurate ratings on a group of notes backed by
subprime mortgages by saying the information came from Moody''s
Corp. (MCO) and Standard  Poor''s, a judge ruled. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin in Manhattan said Oct.
5 that investors in a structured-investment vehicle named Cheyne
may go forward with claims the bank is responsible for passing
along inflated ratings on the notes. </p>
<p>The investors, which include Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank,
claim Morgan Stanley was negligent in conveying ratings that it
should have know were inaccurate. Scheindlin, applying New York
law, rejected Morgan Stanley''s argument that the alleged
misstatements were made by the rating companies, not the bank. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s conveyance of the inaccurate ratings --
combined with its omission of nonpublic facts that it knew would
undercut the ratings -- represented a breach of its duty to
provide plaintiffs with accurate information, Scheindlin said
in a written opinion. </p>
<p>In August, Scheindlin denied a request by Moody''s and
Standard  Poor''s to dismiss fraud claims against them in the
suit. She also allowed the investors to pursue claims of aiding
and abetting fraud against Morgan Stanley. </p>
<p>Mary Claire Delaney, a spokeswoman for New York-based
Morgan Stanley, declined to comment on the ruling. </p>
<h2>August Decision </h2>
<p>At the time of her August decision, Scheindlin ordered the
investors to provide arguments for why she shouldn''t dismiss the
negligent-misrepresentation claim against Morgan Stanley. </p>
<p>A defendant whose duty consisted of an obligation to
provide accurate information to a plaintiff may be liable for
negligently providing inaccurate information even if that
information originated from third parties, Scheindlin said in
the Oct. 5 opinion. </p>
<p>The case is Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB) v. Morgan Stanley 
Co., 08-CV-7508, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>U.S. soft drink companies led by
Coca-Cola Co. (KO) and PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) have agreed to put calorie counts
on vending machines and encourage low-calorie drinks as sugary
beverages come under increasing scrutiny. </p>
<p>Starting in 2013, vending machines in government buildings
in Chicago and San Antonio will advise consumers to Check then
Choose and Try a Low-Calorie Beverage, according to a
statement today by the American Beverage Association, the
industry''s chief trade group. The companies, including Dr Pepper
Snapple Group Inc. (DPS), will then expand the plan nationally. </p>
<p>Amid rising obesity rates, lawmakers have proposed taxing
sugary drinks in more than 30 states to curb consumption, an
initiative that has foundered after resistance from the soda
lobby. That prompted New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the
city''s health board to ban the sale of super-size sugared drinks
in some locations. U.S. soft drink sales have declined for seven
straight years amid lower demand for full-calorie colas as
consumers turn to healthier options. </p>
<p>It''s the next step in the evolution of public
disclosure, said Thomas Mullarkey, a Chicago-based analyst for
Morningstar Inc (MORN), citing past advances such as nutrition labels
and front-of-package calorie citations. It helps consumers
while appeasing political powers and regulators, so soft drink
companies are seen as encouraging healthy decisions. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Asset Management
Chairman Jim O''Neill said he did not apply to become the next

<p>I have not applied, O''Neill said in an e-mail today.
I don''t think it was appropriate for me to apply. I have an

<p>Candidates to replace Mervyn King as chief of the U.K.

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX) lost a U.S. Supreme Court bid to block a $19 billion judgment by an Ecuadorean court in an almost two-decade legal battle over pollution in the Amazon rain forest. </p> <p>The highest U.S. court, without comment, today let stand a federal appeals court ruling against Chevron. The appellate court said a federal trial judge in New York couldn''t bar a group of Ecuadoreans from seeking to collect the award anywhere in the world. </p> <p>Chevron says the judgment is the product of fabricated evidence and is the largest awarded by a foreign court against a U.S. company. The Ecuadoreans blame Texaco Inc., which Chevron acquired in 2001, for destroying the environment in the Lago Agrio region of the rain forest. </p> <p>The high court rebuff eliminates one legal avenue for Chevron in litigation that has produced dozens of U.S. court decisions. The company, based in San Ramon, California, is pressing separate legal theories before a federal trial judge in New York. </p> <p>While Chevron is disappointed that the court denied our petition, we will continue to defend against the plaintiffs'' lawyers'' attempts to enforce the fraudulent Ecuadorean judgment and to further expose their misconduct, Chevron said in an e- mailed statement. </p> <p>The appeal centered on the power of federal courts to issue so-called declaratory judgments. In ruling against Chevron, the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York said the company couldn''t seek an order blocking the award until the Ecuadoreans sought to enforce the judgment. </p> <p>Chevron''s latest loss before the Supreme Court is an example of the company''s increasingly futile battle to avoid paying its legal obligations in Ecuador, Aaron Marr Page, a lawyer for the Ecuadoreans, said in an e-mail. Chevron is running from justice while its toxic dumping continues to create an imminent danger of death to indigenous peoples in Ecuador. </p> <p>Justice Samuel Alito didn''t take part in today''s action. As is the court''s custom, he gave no reasons. </p> <p>The Supreme Court case is Chevron v.

<p>(Corrects percentage decline in second paragraph.) </p>
<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX) said third-quarter
earnings were substantially lower than second-quarter
results amid lower oil output, falling crude prices and weaker
U.S. refining returns. The stock fell 1.7 percent. </p>
<p>Oil and natural gas output fell 4 percent to the equivalent
of 2.518 million barrels a day in June and July from 2.624
million for the entire second quarter, the San Ramon,
California-based company said in a statement today. </p>
<p>Chevron said production fell as Hurricane Isaac shut wells
in the Gulf of Mexico and oilfield repairs were carried out in
the U.K. and Kazakhstan. The company received an average price
of $96.86 for each barrel of crude pumped outside the U.S., 2.4
percent less than in the prior quarter. </p>
<p>Chevron''s refining profit declined after an August fire
damaged a crude-processing unit at a Richmond, California,
plant. The unit will remain out of service through the end of
December, the company said. A refinery in Pascagoula,
Mississippi, was shut for part of the quarter as Isaac passed
through the region, according to the statement. </p>
<p>Chevron declined 1.7 percent to $115.36 at 5:25 p.m. in New
York. </p>
<p>Chevron, the second-largest U.S. energy company by market
value, is scheduled to release full third-quarter results on
Nov. 2. Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) is the biggest U.S. energy company. </p>

<p>The crude unit was knocked out of service during an August
blaze at the refinery near San Francisco. Chevron, based in San
Ramon, California, announced the extent of the closure in a
statement today. </p>
<p>The Richmond disruption was the first in a chain of events
that crippled Californian fuel markets and led to gasoline
shortages that have forced some filling stations to shut and
others to raise prices close to $5 a gallon. Governor Jerry
Brown this week ordered regulators to ease pollution rules to
speed delivery of fuel supplies. </p>
<p>Regular gasoline at the pump climbed to an all-time peak of
$4.671 a gallon, according to data published today by AAA, the

Prices jumped 50 cents last week as refineries reduced output
and Chevron shut a crude pipeline because of contamination. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) and other movie and
TV studios asked a federal judge to rule that the file-sharing
website Lime Wire LLC and its founder, Mark Gorton, induced
people to illegally download shows and films without payment. </p>
<p>The companies, which also include Viacom Inc. (VIAB), News Corp. (NWSA)''s
Twentieth Century Fox Film and Time Warner Inc. (TWX)''s Warner Bros.
Entertainment, are seeking the same judgment a federal court
granted to the music industry against Lime Wire in 2010,
according to a court filing in Manhattan yesterday. </p>
<p>Users by the tens of millions were attracted to LimeWire
to access -- for free -- infringing copies of virtually any type
of copyrighted content, the entertainment companies, which
sued in February, said in yesterday''s motion for summary
judgment. </p>
<p>The plaintiffs said U.S. District Judge Harold Baer should
find Lime Wire and Gorton liable for inducement of copyright
infringement without a trial. TV shows such as South Park
and Desperate Housewives and movies including Avatar and
the Harry Potter films were among the material allegedly
infringed, according to the filing. </p>
<p>Lime Wire developed peer-to-peer software that allowed
users to share digital entertainment files on their computers
with other people over the Internet. </p>
<h2>Gorton Directed'' </h2>
<p>Gorton directed and benefited from Lime Wire''s inducement
of infringement, the entertainment companies said in the
filing. </p>
<p>Gorton operates Tower Capital Research LLC, a New York-
based hedge fund that trades securities based on mathematical
algorithms it developed. Gorton said today in a phone interview
that he hadn''t seen the motion for summary judgment and couldn''t
comment on it. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood in May 2010 found Lime Wire
and Gorton liable for inducing infringement of copyrights for
recorded music. The site was shut down by an October 2010 court
order. Lime Wire settled with the recording industry for
$105 million in May 2011 during a trial in Manhattan to
determine damages. </p>
<p>In the new case, the parties were unable to reach a
settlement, according to a docket entry in September. </p>
<p>The case is Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. v. Lime Wire
LLC, 12-0818, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) probably
will post a third-quarter profit that exceeds Wall Street
estimates more than that of any other big bank, according to
International Strategy  Investment Group LLC. </p>
<p>Gains on the firm''s own investments and revenue from
underwriting and trading debt will help New York-based Goldman
Sachs earn $2.70 a share, ISI analysts led by Ed Najarian said
yesterday in a research note. The average estimate of 25
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg is $2.27. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), ranked first
and fourth by assets among U.S. banks, are set to kick off the
industry''s third-quarter earnings season tomorrow. Goldman
Sachs, the fifth-largest bank and the one that gets the highest
percentage of revenue from trading, is scheduled for Oct. 16. </p>
<p>We expect most large banks to beat earnings-per-share,
or EPS, estimates, Najarian wrote. The main drivers of EPS
upside should be stronger than expected mortgage origination
revenue and debt capital markets revenue. </p>
<p>Najarian predicts New York-based JPMorgan will report
earnings per share of $1.20 and San Francisco-based Wells Fargo
88 cents, both one cent better than the average estimate of
analysts in the Bloomberg survey. </p>
<p>JPMorgan and Citigroup Inc. (C), the third-largest U.S. lender,
offer the biggest potential share increases from third-quarter
results, according to Najarian. That''s because both stocks are
valued at 8 to 9 times their estimated core annual earnings,
which excludes one-time gains and losses, he wrote. Citigroup
may earn $1.01 a share in the quarter, beating the average
estimate by 4 cents, according to the note. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s stock, which has climbed 14 percent since
the end of August, already factors in higher profit, Najarian
wrote. If third-quarter profit of $2.70 a share is annualized to
$10.80, the stock is valued at 11.1 times earnings. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s own bank research team, led by London-based Kian Abouhossein, also published a note yesterday raising its
estimates for third-quarter revenue from investment banking and
fixed-income trading and recommended owning a higher weighting
in banks tied to those activities. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS)''s ABC network and
Buena Vista Television units asked a federal appeals court to
overturn a $319 million judgment won two years ago by the U.K.
creators of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. </p>
<p>A lawyer for ABC and Buena Vista argued their case today
before a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals meeting
in Pasadena, California. The Disney units claim the judge who
oversaw the trial allowed the jury to adopt a flawed reading of
the contract with Celador International Ltd., entitling the
creators to a share of ABC''s profits. </p>
<p>This case never should have gone to the jury, Seth Waxman, a lawyer representing the Disney units, said at today''s
hearing. </p>
<p>ABC and Buena Vista said in their appeal that the judge
overseeing the trial committed a cascading series of errors
that allowed the jury to interpret the contract to mean that
Celador was entitled to a 50 percent share of both ABC''s and
Buena Vista''s profits, rather than just Buena Vista''s. </p>
<p>Closely held Celador sued in 2004, claiming Buena Vista and
ABC through a complex web of self-dealing transactions
allowed ABC to keep the advertising revenue and pay Buena Vista
only a licensing fee equal to the cost of producing the show.
That kept Buena Vista from earning a profit from Millionaire
that it would have had to share with the creators, Celador said. </p>
<h2>Jury Verdict </h2>
<p>A jury in Riverside, California, in July 2010 agreed that
the Disney units breached the contract and awarded Celador $269
million in damages, to which U.S. District Judge Virginia A. Phillips added $50 million in pre-judgment interest. </p>
<p>U.S. Circuit Judge Andrew Kleinfeld today questioned
Celador''s lawyer, Robin Meadow, on the company''s claim that it
was harmed because ABC paid Buena Vista a fee per episode of
Millionaire that equaled the production cost, or about
$825,000, rather than as much as $3 million to a producer
unaffiliated with Disney. </p>
<p>What I don''t get is why ABC can''t do that, Kleinfeld
said. It''s an economy of scale that Disney has. Why can''t they
use an internal company and do it cheap? </p>
<p>The judge also asked what evidence Celador provided at
trial that Buena Vista didn''t get from the network what it
should have gotten. The license fee ABC paid Buena Vista was
kept artificially low, Meadow said. </p>
<p>License fees are based on success, revenue is based on
success, he said. They flow together. </p>
<h2>Syndication, Merchandising </h2>
<p>ABC and Buena Vista said in their appeal that it''s industry
practice for the producer, Buena Vista, to get a licensing fee
from the network that is equal to the cost of producing a game
show. The producer makes a profit, if any, from syndicating the
show to local television stations and from other sources,
including merchandising, according to the Disney units. </p>
<p>Celador, under the 1999 agreement that gave ABC and Buena
Vista the North American rights to Millionaire, was entitled
to an up-front option payment and guaranteed fees for each
episode, according to the Disney units. </p>
<p>The U.K. company also would receive 50 percent of Buena
Vista''s revenue from the show, after certain deductions
including Buena Vista''s normal distribution fees, costs and an
overhead charge equal to about 10 percent of the production
costs, according to the appeal brief. </p>
<p>The overhead charge meant Buena Vista had a deficit from
the show after its initial run on ABC, when Millionaire
aired as often as every night during two-week special events.
ABC canceled the show in 2002, and Buena Vista has since
produced a version of Millionaire for syndication, according
to the appeal by the Disney units. </p>
<h2>Slumdog Millionaire'' </h2>
<p>The show''s performance in syndication has not matched its
network success, ABC and Buena Vista said. The show has
earned a profit, but the margin has been too low to cover the
distribution fee for syndication specified in the rights
agreement, let alone make up the deficit. </p>
<p>Millionaire was first broadcast in the U.K. in 1998 and
has been carried in 106 countries, including Australia, India,
Japan, Germany and Russia, according to the creators. The show
also was featured in the movie Slumdog Millionaire, which
was co-produced by Celador and won eight Oscars in 2009. </p>
<p>Celador said in its response to ABC and Buena Vista''s
appeal that it specifically wanted to make a deal directly with
ABC, not with a producer, and that the agreement it made
included 50 percent of the network''s profits from the show. </p>
<p>After the rights agreement had been signed, defendants
entered into a mind-boggling succession of agreements that
shuffled Millionaire'' rights and obligations among various
Disney-affiliated entities, Celador said. The goal was to
ensure that Millionaire'' never would earn network-run broadcast
profits for Celador to share, Celador said. </p>
<h2>Network Promises </h2>
<p>The U.K. company said that, if the appeals court reverses
the jury verdict, it should also overturn the judge''s ruling
that ABC can''t be held liable for fraud. Celador alleges that
ABC induced it into making a deal by making promises the network
didn''t intend to fulfill. </p>
<p>Phillips found that the alleged fraudulent
misrepresentations were too vague, conclusory and of the
nature of opinion to be actionable, according to Celador''s
cross-appeal. </p>
<p>The case is Celador v. ABC, 11-55014 and 11-55172, U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (San Francisco). </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) was ordered by
an Oklahoma court to pay $18.1 million to the trust fund of a
75-year-old oil heiress for selling her derivatives that she
claimed she didn''t understand. </p>
<p>The bank must also pay punitive damages to the Carolyn S.
Burford Trust, which benefits the granddaughter of Oklahoma
oilman William G. Skelly, Tulsa County District Court Judge
Linda Morrissey ruled yesterday. The evidence overwhelmingly
demonstrates the bank''s grossly negligent and reckless
administration of the trust, Morrissey said. </p>
<p>The trust lost a substantial amount of money on
contracts called variable prepaid forwards, which bankers at
Bank One Trust Co. sold to Ann Fletcher in 2000 as a way to
generate more income, according to the ruling. After Bank One
Corp. merged with New York-based JPMorgan in 2004, the bank
managed the trust for two more years. </p>
<p>This bank developed a strategy whereby they could utilize
the funds in this trust in order to purchase investment products
from their own equity division, Erin Donovan, a lawyer in
Tulsa who represented Fletcher, said in a phone interview. She
thought they were her friends. </p>
<p>The bank breached its fiduciary duty when it sold the
derivatives, Morrissey wrote. Bankers were given incentives to
push the variable prepaid forwards, which generated as much as
$2 million in fees, she said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) expects
emerging markets to provide a greater share of its revenue once
the global economy recovers, after proving resilient in the
current crisis, Vice Chairman J. Michael Evans said. </p>
<p>Emerging markets may contribute growth in all three of the
bank''s basic businesses, Evans said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television from Seoul today, listing mergers and
acquisitions, asset management and securities. He declined to
give specific revenue figures. </p>
<p>We could be in a challenging environment for the
foreseeable future, Evans said. If things even get a bit
better in Europe and the U.S., we can count on emerging
markets to contribute more, he said. </p>
<p>Emerging economies have expanded at an average annual pace
of 6.2 percent during the past five years, outstripping
developed markets'' 0.8 percent pace, and will grow 5.3 percent
this year, compared with 1.3 percent, according to data and
forecasts from the International Monetary Fund. The MSCI
Emerging Markets Index (MXEF) has climbed 8.3 percent this year,
compared with an 11 percent gain in the MSCI World (MXWO) Index of
developed countries. </p>
<p>Weakness in global markets has made it easier for China to
shift toward an economic-growth model that''s less dependent on
exports and more on domestic demand, said Evans. </p>
<p>The country is responding to the slowdown in the U.S. and
Europe with significant structural reform, Evans, who
oversees the New York-based bank''s businesses in emerging
markets, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television today
from Seoul. </p>
<h2>Growth Model </h2>
<p>It would have been a more painful transition if that
transition was required in a stronger market, particularly in
the Western world, Evans said. In the last four or five
years, China has had an opportunity to observe that the export-
driven model of growth is no longer a sustainable model. </p>
<p>President Hu Jintao pledged last month to boost domestic
demand and promote more balanced growth as a slowdown in exports
puts pressure on the world''s second-largest economy. Spending on
roads, bridges, subways and other public-works projects surged
in 2009 and 2010 as much of a 4 trillion-yuan ($636 billion)
stimulus and an unprecedented expansion in bank lending was
directed toward local government projects. </p>

While German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited Athens to assure Greek citizens she wants them to stay in the euro, the largest opposition party says Greece should renege on all its bailout agreements and a report today showed unemployment rose above 25 percent in July. </p> <p>The move will help disassociate CCH from problems related to Greece including a potential exit from the euro area and related capital controls, said Paris Mantzavras, an analyst at Pantelakis Securities in Athens. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein said he would be willing to pay higher U.S. taxes if he thought it would help reduce the national debt. </p> <p>No one is so unpatriotic that they wouldn''t pay a little bit more to resolve it, Blankfein, 58, said today in an interview on CNBC. He said that no one would be willing to pay higher taxes unless they''re sure it was part of a comprehensive solution to the country''s budget. </p> <p>Blankfein discussed the U.S.''s fiscal challenges with Erskine Bowles, a Democrat and former White House chief of staff, and Alan Simpson, a former Republican Senator, who led a deficit-reduction committee that failed to win congressional support in 2010. All three emphasized the importance of Congress reaching a compromise to cut spending, raise revenue and encourage economic growth. </p> <p>If there were some compromise laid out, what kind of a stimulus do you think that would provide? asked Blankfein. I''d be a buyer of the market. </p> <p>Blankfein and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, both of whom have been grilled by members of Congress in recent years about their own businesses, have turned the tables recently, publicly urging politicians to reach an agreement to reduce the U.S. debt. Dimon, 56, said yesterday the economy would be booming if Congress had passed the so-called Bowles-Simpson plan last year. </p> <h2>Left-Center'' </h2> <p>We have a stake in this country like everybody else and I think we have the experience and the competence to let people know the consequences of failing to address deficit spending and the national debt, Blankfein said. Blankfein, who backed Hillary Clinton''s campaign for president in 2008 and hasn''t endorsed a candidate this year, said he''s on the left-center side of things politically. </p> <p>Simpson and Bowles, whose plan was defeated by a 382-38 vote in the House of Representatives in March, are meeting this week with a bipartisan group of eight senators seeking to avert a fiscal cliff of tax increases and automatic spending cuts at year''s end. Simpson, 81, and Bowles, 67, also plan to begin a $30 million campaign to build public support for a debt deal. </p> <p>The two have signed up about 75 to 80 CEOs for a fiscal leadership council, said Bowles, who serves on the boards of Morgan Stanley (MS) and Facebook Inc. and whose wife is a member of the JPMorgan board. Blankfein and Dimon are among the CEOs. </p> <p>Asked by CNBC''s Steve Liesman if he might serve as U.S. Treasury secretary, Bowles said I expect to be living in North Carolina for the rest of my life. </p> <h2>Mutual Distrust </h2> <p>Simpson said that using business people to win support didn''t guarantee success. Politicians don''t like or believe the business people and the business people don''t like or believe the politicians, he said. </p> <p>The stock market''s recent gains indicate that traders are too comfortable with the idea that Congress will avert the fiscal cliff by the end of the year, he said. </p> <p>Investors really believe honestly that no Congress could be this stupid, and by God, they can, Simpson said. </p> <p>In response to a question from Liesman, Blankfein said he''s not really concerned about the revelations in a book due Oct. 22 by a former Goldman Sachs employee who has publicly criticized the firm. I''ll tell you I''m not looking forward to the hoopla that will surround the book''s release, he said, adding that he hasn''t read it. </p> <p>The firm''s investigation of claims made by the former employee, Greg Smith, in a New York Times op-ed earlier this year didn''t turn up any evidence to support his allegations, Blankfein said. </p> <h2>Incomplete Information'' </h2> <p>Still when you think about what happened in the last four or five years, it will go into the mix, he said. </p> <p>Blankfein and other executives at Goldman Sachs, the fifth- biggest U.S. bank by assets, were interrogated by the Senate''s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations in April 2010. A report issued by the committee accused the firm of misleading investors into buying mortgage-linked assets just before the financial crisis, even as Goldman Sachs''s own traders were betting against them. The firm rejected the accusation, saying they were making markets for their clients. </p> <p>In July 2010, Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $550 million to settle the Securities  Exchange Commission''s claim that the firm misled investors who bought a mortgage-linked investment called Abacus in 2007. The firm said in the settlement that marketing materials for the 2007 deal contained incomplete information. </p> <p>Dimon, who spoke yesterday in Washington at an event hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations, was questioned by the House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee in June over his bank''s $5.8 billion loss on derivative bets. JPMorgan is the biggest U.S. bank by assets. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Stephen Morris" date="Oct 11, 2012  1:04 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-11/coca-cola-hbc-gets-2-billion-loan-to-back-london-listing-2-.html"><headline>Coca-Cola HBC Gets $2 Billion Loan to Back London Listing</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling SA, (EEEK) the
world''s second-largest bottler of the soft drink, has obtained
1.55 billion euros ($2 billion) of loans to back the company''s
move out of Greece. </p>
<p>The financing is being arranged for Coca-Cola HBC AG, a new
company established in Switzerland to take over the Greek
business, and comprises 550 million euros of acquisition
financing, 500 million euros of revolving credit facilities and
a 500 million-euro term loan to refinance debt, according to an
Athens exchange filing today. </p>
<p>The company, advised by Credit Suisse Group AG, plans a
primary listing in London and potentially New York, it said.
Listing in London will give us greater recognition among
international investors, will increase the liquidity of our
stock and improve our access to the international equity and
debt markets, Dimitris Lois, Coca-Cola HBC''s chief executive
officer, told reporters on a conference call today. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola HBC shares fell 4.9 percent today to 15.66 euros
at the close of trading in Athens. </p>
<p>The acquisition loan will be used for the cash component of
the offer if it''s needed, and the revolver and refinancing lines
will replace Coca-Cola Hellenic''s existing debt if required,
according to the filing. </p>
<p>Both loans mature in July 2014 or 18 months after the
company issues a prospectus for the London Stock Exchange
listing, whichever is sooner. The refinancing loan matures in
March 2014 or at the time the acquisition facility matures,
whichever is later. </p>
<p>Under a revolver, money can be borrowed again once it''s
repaid. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola HBC may enter the FTSE 100 if successful, as its
market value is equivalent to about 4.4 billion pounds ($7.1
billion). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s Fabrice Tourre will go to trial July 15 in the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission''s lawsuit accusing him of misleading
investors in a collateralized debt obligation. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in Manhattan set the
trial date today at the end of a hearing in which an SEC lawyer
argued that she should reinstate some claims against Tourre that
another judge dismissed earlier in the case. </p>
<p>Last year, U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones threw out some
of the SEC''s claims after Tourre argued that he couldn''t be held
liable under U.S. securities law for transactions that occurred
outside the country. </p>
<p>The SEC argued today that the claims should be reinstated
because of a recent appeals court ruling that applied a broader
definition of domestic securities transaction than the one
used by Jones. Tourre''s case was assigned to Forrest last week. </p>
<p>Tourre, 33, who is studying for a Ph.D. in economics at the
University of Chicago, wasn''t present in the courtroom today.
His lawyer, Pamela Chepiga, told Forrest that she will check
with her client to make sure there is no conflict between his
exams and the trial date. </p>
<p>The SEC sued Goldman Sachs and Tourre in April 2010. The
New York-based investment bank agreed in July 2010 to pay
$550 million to settle the allegations against it. </p>
<p>The case is SEC v. Tourre, 10-03229, U.S. District Court,

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Financial
Officer Douglas Braunstein is considering leaving his position
and may seek a role in the firm''s investment bank, where he
previously led dealmaking, according to a person with direct
knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>Braunstein, who was promoted to CFO in June 2010, is likely
to remain in that role for at least several months, said the
person, who requested anonymity because a decision on the move
isn''t final. The finance chief had reported to Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon until July, when Matt Zames, 41, became his
boss and co-chief operating officer amid management changes in
the wake of a $5.8 billion trading loss. </p>
<p>Braunstein, 51, didn''t respond to a phone call seeking
comment. The Wall Street Journal reported late yesterday that he
is expected to leave his post. </p>
<p>The trading loss, tied to wrong-way bets on derivatives, is
being reviewed by agencies including the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.K.
Financial Services Authority and the U.S. Senate Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations. An internal probe showed traders
in London priced their books aggressively and may have tried
to hide the full extent of their losses, the company has said. </p>
<p>The FBI is focusing its inquiry on four former London-based
executives in the bank''s chief investment office, where the loss
occurred, and the bureau could make arrests in the next several
months, the New York Times reported late yesterday, citing
officials briefed on the case. </p>
<h2>London Whale </h2>
<p>The newspaper said the FBI is scrutinizing former JPMorgan
traders including Bruno Iksil, nicknamed the London Whale
because his wagers were big enough to move the market, as well
as his boss, Javier Martin-Artajo, and former Europe CIO head
Achilles Macris. </p>
<p>A lawyer for Macris, 51, declined to comment and an
attorney for Iksil didn''t respond to requests for comment,
according to the New York Times. Greg Campbell, a lawyer for
Martin-Artajo, said his client is confident that he will be
cleared of wrongdoing after a fair reconstruction of these
complex events is completed, the newspaper reported. </p>
<p>Joe Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment. </p>
<p>A series of personnel changes stemmed from the botched
bets, starting with the resignation in May of Chief Investment
Officer Ina Drew, 56, less than a week after Dimon, 56,
disclosed the trading loss. Her exit was followed by that of
Iksil, Martin-Artajo and Macris. </p>
<h2>Senate Panel </h2>
<p>Dimon and Drew are among executives who have been
questioned by aides to the Senate panel, overseen by Chairman
Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, people familiar with the
discussions said. Joseph Bonocore, a former CIO finance chief,
and David Olson, an ex-credit trader in the unit, also have been
interviewed, said the people, who asked not to be identified
because the talks are private. </p>
<p>Bonocore and Olson now work at New York-based Citigroup
Inc. Shannon Bell, a spokeswoman for that bank, declined to
comment. </p>
<p>Two senior managers last week also disclosed that they
intend to leave the company. Irene Tse, 43, who ran the CIO for
North America under Drew, told employees that she''s resigning
and people familiar with the matter have said she plans to start
a hedge fund. Former Chief Risk Officer Barry Zubrow, 59, who
runs JPMorgan''s lobbying operation, announced Oct. 5 that he
will retire at year-end. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is scheduled to report third-quarter results
tomorrow before U.S. markets open. The lender may say net income
climbed 14 percent to $4.87 billion, according to the average
estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>

<p>The Federal Reserve will struggle to end its quantitative easing program, said Gary D. Cohn, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s president and chief operating officer. </p> <p>I understand what they''re trying to do and I will tell you this, this is going to be difficult to stop or to exit, Cohn told Bloomberg Television today in Tokyo. At the end of this -- there will be an end to quantitative easing -- we will have to go through the pains of stopping quantitative easing. </p> <p>The Fed last month announced its third round of large-scale asset purchases since 2008, with no limit this time on the ultimate amount it would buy or the duration of the program. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke says that stimulus will be expanded until policy makers see sustained improvement in the labor market and that the strategy works in part by boosting the prices of assets such as equities. </p> <p>We know the Fed wants to create job growth, Cohn said. We know that the Fed wants to create asset appreciation. </p> <p>Bank of America Corp. Chief Executive Officer Brian T. Moynihan said in a separate interview that the U.S. central bank is working hard to boost demand that''s less than potential and that its exit plan is something to worry about down the road. </p> <h2>Confidence Deficit </h2> <p>Right now we''ve got to make sure we continue to push confidence, he said. That''s a problem that we''ll face more in the future than we face today. </p> <p>Fed Vice Chairman Janet Yellen said in Tokyo yesterday that policy makers have a plan to normalize monetary policy when the time comes. After it begins to raise its benchmark interest rate from near zero, the U.S. central bank has indicated it wants to sell many of the assets on its balance sheet in a very gradual and predictable way, she said. </p> <p>We know that this will be a challenging feat to normalize monetary policy, she said, noting bank balance sheets may be vulnerable to any sharp increase in rates. </p> <p>Bank of Israel Governor Stanley Fischer, a former Citigroup Inc. executive, said in Tokyo that central banks know what to do when inflation accelerates. You just reverse the operation, it''s not technically difficult, he said. I have enough belief in my central bank colleagues to believe that if they see inflation beginning to get underway, they will react and stop it. </p> <h2>Not Alone </h2> <p>The Fed isn''t alone in easing monetary policy, with the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan (8301) both adding to stimulus in the past three months. The ECB cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low of 0.75 percent and pledged to buy the bonds of governments that agree to austerity conditions. The Bank of Japan last month boosted its asset-purchase fund by 10 trillion yen ($128 billion) and abandoned a minimum yield for the bonds it purchases. </p> <p>They are all kind of doing the same thing so it has less impact than if other players were on the sideline, said Cohn. </p> <p>While he praised ECB President Mario Draghi for doing a spectacular job and removing a lot of risk off the table, Cohn said the ECB can''t deal with the real long-term problem of Europe, which is economic growth. Draghi worked at Goldman Sachs from 2002 to 2005. </p> <h2>Lehman Moment </h2> <p>Cohn echoed his June view that Europe needs a moment like Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.''s 2008 bankruptcy to solve its debt stress. </p> <p>I''m not sure what the moment will be, but I do believe there''s going to be a moment when everyone takes a deep breath and says we''ve got to fix this situation,'' Cohn said. </p> <p>He said there is a small probability the euro-area will stick together, saying it''s more likely than not that some countries will exit the 17-nation bloc to pursue growth. Greece, for example, could enjoy a thriving, booming economy based on tourism within five years if they devalued, he said. </p> <p>With the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund under way in Tokyo, Cohn said the world economy is in a tough place and lacks leadership. </p> <p>Europe''s strains, a slowdown in China and the U.S.''s fiscal challenges all point you to be cautious, Moynihan said. The U.S. economy continues to grow and Europe''s problems will ebb and flow, he said. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Elisa Martinuzzi and Takahiko Hyuga" date="Oct 11, 2012  2:49 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-11/goldman-s-cohn-sees-small-chance-euro-area-will-stick-together.html"><headline>Goldman''s Cohn Sees Small'' Chance Euro Area Will Stick Together</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) President
and Chief Operating Officer Gary D. Cohn sees a small
probability that the euro area will stick together, saying it''s
more likely that some countries will exit to pursue growth. </p>
<p>In federalism, you create a unified Europe, where the
countries that are thriving because of the currency subsidize
the countries that are contracting because of the currency,
Cohn said in an interview in Tokyo today. I would put a
relatively small probability of that happening. </p>
<p>The European Central Bank program pledging unlimited
support to debt-burdened nations if they sign up for economic
reforms deals with the pre-existing condition but hasn''t
addressed the lack of growth, Cohn said. ECB President Mario Draghi pledged to do whatever it takes to defend the euro as
officials seek to stem the debt crisis. </p>
<p>Europe still needs a moment similar to Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.''s 2008 bankruptcy, Cohn said, reiterating comments
made in June. The 17 countries that share the euro must find
ways to support economic growth in the weaker members, he had
said at that time, adding that austerity programs don''t support
expansion. </p>
<p>Southern Europe has no ability to grow the economy with
the fixed exchange-rate environment they''re in, he said today. </p>

<p>An agreement isn''t assured, said one of the people, who

be reached in the next few weeks, Sky News reported yesterday,
citing people close to the beverage company. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola, owner of the world''s most-valuable brand, has
increased its ties to entertainment so it can market products to
young consumers in a subtle way. The Atlanta-based company
reached a deal in April to add Spotify to its Internet

the company as high as $4 billion, people with knowledge of the

<p>The Pentagon''s top weapons buyer has
approved continued production of a General Dynamics Corp. (GD)
infantry radio that the Defense Department''s chief tester found
ineffective and unreliable earlier this year. </p>
<p>Frank Kendall, the under secretary of defense for
acquisition, backed the purchase of as many as 3,726 two-channel
digital radios for infantry rucksacks and vehicles, in addition
to the 100 already under contract, according to an Oct. 11 memo
obtained by Bloomberg News. The order may be valued at more than
$250 million. </p>
<p>The Defense Department''s testing office in July criticized
the Manpack radio and recommended additional testing before
Kendall''s office made a decision on whether to increase
quantities. The radio, as configured in response to some of its
earlier flaws, demonstrated adequate range, but continued
to demonstrate poor reliability, Pentagon test director
Michael Gilmore said today in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Kendall also gave other companies such as Harris Corp. (HRS) a
chance to bid on the bulk of the 71,814 Manpack radios the Army
intends to buy. In the memo, he directed the service to conduct
a full and open competition for radios starting no later
than July 2013. </p>
<p>The second batch of radios will be used for testing and
development until a decision is made on full-rate production and
potential deployment in the field, Army spokesman Matthew Bourke
said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>The Manpack radio is part of the Joint Tactical Radio
System. The Pentagon in July approved production of 13,077
additional handheld Rifleman JTRS radios also made by Falls
Church, Virginia-based General Dynamics. </p>
<h2>Poor Reliability'' </h2>
<p>Gilmore said today that his earlier criticism was based on
the radio''s performance in a stressing environment where
soldiers operated the radios in a manner which represents combat
conditions. Under those conditions, the radio exhibited poor
reliability and inadequate range, he said. </p>
<p>The latest test this month was in a benign environment
and not designed to replicate realistic combat conditions nor
was it designed to test the full functionality of the radio,
Gilmore wrote. </p>
<p>Kendall said in his memo that the Army needed to ensure the
service addresses deficiencies identified by the test office
and in the latest round of evaluations. </p>
<p>While he didn''t provide details of the latest test results,
Kendall said the radio has met criteria he set for proceeding
with additional limited production in a developmental test
environment. </p>
<h2>Improving Reliability </h2>
<p>Kendall also directed the Army to perform a thorough
reliability growth analysis and develop a detailed plan
for achieving required reliability. </p>
<p>The Army will proceed in its acquisition strategy of a
full and open competition, Kendall wrote. </p>
<p>Chris Marzilli, General Dynamics'' president of C4 Systems,
said in an e-mailed statement that the company expects the
contract to be valued at more than $250 million. </p>
<p>The radios use government-owned, non-proprietary software
to not only preserve soldiers'' ability to use legacy radios but
also places in their hands transformational capability, he
said. </p>
<p>Asked about Gilmore''s e-mail, Marzilli wrote, We are
pleased with the decision to issue the order, and we will
support the Army in completing the remaining tasks outlined by
Kendall''s memo. </p>
<p>The radios are made at General Dynamics'' Scottsdale,
Arizona, facility. </p>
<p>Harris has repeatedly expressed interest in bidding on the
program. The Melbourne, Florida-based company says it has more
than 68 percent of the market for such tactical radios. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S. bank by assets, reported record third-quarter profit that beat analysts'' estimates as mortgage revenue soared 72 percent. </p> <p>Net income rose 34 percent to $5.71 billion, or $1.40 a share, from $4.26 billion, or $1.02, a year earlier, the New York-based company said today in a statement. Earnings, which included a loss on accounting adjustments, beat the average estimate of $1.20 among 30 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. </p> <p>JPMorgan is still recovering from a wrong-way bet on credit derivatives that cost the bank about $6.25 billion through the first nine months of this year, not including what the bank said was a modest additional loss in the third quarter. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56, got help restoring investor confidence from historically low interest rates and government programs that fueled demand for home loans. </p> <p>The housing market has turned the corner, Dimon said in the statement. We were encouraged that credit trends continued to modestly improve, and, as a result, the firm reduced the related loan-loss reserves by $900 million. </p> <p>Low interest rates have also been hurting the industry as banks earn less on the money they lend. The bank''s net interest margin, which measures profitability on loans and other interest-bearing assets, dropped to 2.43 percent from 2.66 percent a year earlier. </p>

<p>Charges against William Bryan Jennings, the former Morgan Stanley (MS) U.S. bond-underwriting chief
accused of stabbing a New York cab driver over a fare, will be
dropped, police said. </p>
<p>I''m aware that the charges are being dropped, Detective
Chester Perkowski of the Darien, Connecticut, police department
said today in an interview. He declined to comment further. </p>
<p>Jennings was accused of attacking the driver, Mohamed
Ammar, on Dec. 22 with a 2 1/2-inch blade after a 40-mile
(64 kilometer) ride from New York to the banker''s $3.4 million
home in Darien. Ammar, a native of Egypt and a U.S. citizen,
said Jennings told him, I''m going to kill you. You should go
back to your country, according to a police report. </p>
<p>Jennings faced assault and hate-crime charges, each of
which brings a maximum sentence of five years in prison. He was
also charged with not paying the fare, a misdemeanor. He pleaded
not guilty March 9. </p>
<p>Eugene Riccio, Jennings''s attorney, wouldn''t confirm that
the case had been abandoned. </p>
<p>All I''m saying is we''re showing up, he said today in a
phone interview. We have a court date Monday, and we''re going
to be there. </p>
<h2>Left Bank </h2>
<p>Jennings no longer works at New York-based Morgan Stanley,
according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter who
declined to be named because the information isn''t public. </p>
<p>Pen Pendleton, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley, the sixth-
largest U.S. bank by assets, said in March that Jennings had
been placed on leave. Pendleton didn''t immediately return a call
for comment today. </p>
<p>Riccio declined to comment on his client''s employment.
Jennings didn''t immediately return a phone call to his home. </p>
<p>Steven Weiss, the supervisory state''s attorney, didn''t
return a call seeking comment on the status of the case. </p>
<p>Mr. Ammar is outraged by the prosecutor''s decision and
continues to demand justice, Ammar''s attorney, Hassan Ahmad of
Ahmad Navqi Rodriguez LLP in New York, said in a statement. He
was anxiously awaiting trial this month and had no indication
that the prosecutor would take such a drastic turn nearly a year
after this crime was committed and within days of the trial. </p>
<h2>Seriously Undermine'' </h2>
<p>On March 28, Jennings filed a motion seeking to have the
case dismissed, arguing that Ammar contradicted himself in
statements to the police. The arrest warrant contained false
statements and omissions that seriously undermine Ammar''s
credibility, according to the filing by Jennings. That motion
was still pending and was to be the subject of an Oct. 15
hearing. </p>
<p>Jennings flagged Ammar down in front of Ink48, a hotel on
Manhattan''s West Side, sometime before 11 p.m. after the banker
said his car service didn''t appear, according to the police
report. Jennings had been attending a company Christmas party. </p>
<p>Ammar told police that once they reached Jennings''s home,
he refused to pay the $204 fare they had agreed on. He said he
drove away to find police and that during the ride the banker
stabbed him in the hand. Jennings said that they never agreed on
an amount and that Ammar had demanded $294, which he viewed as
exorbitant. </p>
<p>The case is State of Connecticut v. Jennings 12-0176761,
Superior Court for the State of Connecticut (Stamford). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) raised a
$520 million collateralized loan obligation for PineBridge
Investments LLC, according to two people with knowledge of the
deal. </p>
<p>The fund, Galaxy XIV CLO, includes a $318.75 million slice
rated AAA that pays a rate of 143 basis points more than the
London interbank offered rate, said the people, who declined to
be identified because the terms are private. Libor is the rate
at which banks say they can borrow in dollars from each other. </p>
<p>CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. </p>
<p>This is the second CLO PineBridge has issued this year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Morgan Stanley arranged
a $412.5 million fund for the firm in March. </p>
<p>There have been $32 billion of CLOs backed by widely
syndicated loans raised in the U.S. this year, an increase from
$11.7 billion in all of 2011, according to Bloomberg data. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s investment
bank cut employee compensation 9.4 percent in the first nine
months of the year to $6.98 billion as the division generated
7.1 percent less revenue. </p>
<p>The expense was enough to give each of the division''s
25,884 employees $269,703, according to figures posted today on
the New York-based company''s website. For the same period last
year, the unit set aside $7.71 billion to pay traders,
dealmakers and other personnel, or $289,611 for each of the
26,615 people on staff as of Sept. 30, 2011. </p>
<p>The world''s biggest banks are cutting costs as concerns
that the global economy will slow limit revenue growth and new
capital rules depress returns. Mike Cavanagh and Daniel Pinto
were placed in charge of the investment bank in July, along with
the firm''s corporate bank and treasury and securities-services
units, replacing Jes Staley. </p>
<p>The bank set aside $2.07 billion in the third quarter to
pay investment-bank employees, or 33 percent of that division''s
revenue. JPMorgan''s investment bank had 669 fewer people than at
the end of the second quarter, according to today''s disclosure.
The staff companywide contracted 1 percent to 259,547. </p>
<p>Pay costs for the first nine months of the year were 34
percent of revenue at the investment bank, down from 35 percent
in the same period a year earlier. </p>
<p>The amount set aside for compensation includes salaries,
bonuses, benefits and the cost of deferred pay from previous
years. Figures for average pay don''t represent what any employee
actually receives and are calculated by dividing the total
compensation expense by the number of employees. </p>

<p>Morgan Crucible Co Plc (MGCR) Chief
Executive Officer Mark Robertshaw said the maker of advanced
materials used in body armor and wind-turbine blades will close
facilities in Europe and shift work to lower-cost operations to
counteract a greater-than-expected drop in revenue. </p>
<p>Third-quarter revenue was 10 percent below the preceding
three months, the company said today in a statement. Markets in
Europe and China were particularly affected, the Windsor,
England-based company said. </p>
<p>Morgan Crucible''s advanced materials and technology
business has been hit most by global economic slowdown, with
demand at the ceramics and molten metal systems units is holding
up. The company is grappling with a drop in sales to the U.S.
Department of Defense this year. The stock fell as much as 14
percent, the most in more than three years. </p>
<p>We are looking at the potential closure and
rationalization of some of our smaller plants, Robertshaw said
in a telephone interview. He would not name the facilities,
mainly in Europe, because employees still need to be consulted. </p>
<p>Work will be moved into larger facilities and to existing,
lower-cost sites, he said. Closing decisions, which will cost
about 15 million pounds, will be taken in the next 3 to 4 months
and should yield a 7 million pounds to 8 million pound reduction
in the annual cost base, Robertshaw said. </p>

<p>The lender issued $2.25 billion of fixed-rate securities

<p>The Standard  Poor''s 500 Index may climb to a record 1,575 next year, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s David Kostin predicts, joining four other Wall Street firms in forecasting the benchmark gauge will exceed its 2007 peak. </p> <p>The strategist'' projection implies a 10 percent gain in the SP 500 from the Oct. 12 close of 1,428.59. The advance would take the index above its all-time high of 1,565.15 reached on Oct. 9, 2007. Kostin, chief U.S. equity strategist at New York- based Goldman Sachs, reiterated his estimate for SP 500 earnings to reach $107 a share next year. </p> <p>SP 500 faces near-term political risk in the form of the fiscal cliff'' but has long-term policy support from QE3, Kostin wrote in a note dated Oct. 12, referring to automatic deficit cuts that could go into effect starting in January and a third round of bond purchases from the Federal Reserve to stimulate economic growth. </p> <p>Wall Street strategists so far are unanimous in predicting the SP 500 will reach a record next year, according to the five firms that have made predictions out of 15 tracked by Bloomberg. Kostin''s estimate was shared by Bank of Montreal''s Brian Belski while lower than predictions of 1,600 by Bank of America Corp.''s Savita Subramanian, 1,615 by Tobias Levkovich at Citigroup Inc. and 1,585 by Oppenheimer  Co.''s John Stoltzfus. Kostin''s profit forecast is higher than the average estimate of $106.27 from the strategists tracked by Bloomberg. </p> <h2>Unprecedented Stimulus </h2> <p>The SP 500 has rallied 14 percent this year, poised for its biggest annual gain since 2009, amid better-than-expected earnings and unprecedented stimulus from the Fed to boost the economy. The American equity benchmark needs to increase 9.6 percent from last week''s close to reach its all-time high. </p> <p>The index may slump 13 percent to end this year at 1,250 as a potential government failure to reach an agreement on deficit cuts will spur a contraction in the SP 500''s multiples, according to Kostin. About $607 billion of automatic spending reductions and tax increases will be triggered unless a government comprised is reached this year. Goldman Sachs sees a one-in-three chance that Congress will reach a resolution by December. </p> <p>The SP 500 is trading at 14.5 times earnings, compared with an average income multiple of 16.4 over the last five decades, based on data tracked by Bloomberg. The index''s P/E ratio dropped to 12 in October 2011 after SP stripped the U.S. of its AAA sovereign credit rating on concern spending cuts agreed on by lawmakers to raise the nation''s borrowing limit won''t be enough to reduce record deficits. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Bob Van Voris" date="Oct 15, 2012 10:50 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-15/morgan-stanley-accused-in-suit-of-urging-risky-loans-correct-.html"><headline>Morgan Stanley Sued Over Risky Loans to Black Home Buyers</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) was accused in a
race-bias lawsuit of urging a home lender to target black
borrowers with high-risk mortgages so the bank could profit from
buying and securitizing the loans. </p>
<p>Five black Detroit-area homeowners sued Morgan Stanley
today in New York for violating civil-rights laws covering
housing and credit. They claim the bank encouraged New Century
Financial Corp. (CYFL), the bankrupt mortgage company, to make
combined-risk loans to borrowers who couldn''t pay. </p>
<p>Though profitable for Morgan Stanley, these combined-risk
loans put borrowers on a path toward default and foreclosure,
the plaintiffs said in a complaint filed in federal court in
Manhattan. </p>
<p>The plaintiffs seek to represent thousands of black
borrowers in the Detroit area who received the combined-risk
loans from New Century from 2004 to 2007. They seek unspecified
damages, an injunction against Morgan Stanley and a monitor to
ensure the bank complies with any court orders. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)''s Internet music
service will roll out starting tomorrow on Xbox and next week on
computers with Windows 8, as the company looks to compete
against Pandora Media Inc. (P) and Spotify Ltd. </p>
<p>Xbox Music will offer free, unlimited advertising-supported
streaming of music on computers and tablets. For those seeking
access on the Xbox gaming console and mobile phones, the service
costs $9.99 a month, said Scott Porter, principal program
manager for the product. </p>
<p>Customers who prefer to buy music, rather than just playing
it online, can also purchase albums and tracks. By offering
music streaming and downloads, the world''s largest software
maker is betting it can attract users from Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s iTunes
and Amazon.com Inc.''s music store, as well as listeners of
streaming services such as Pandora, Spotify, Rdio Inc. and
Rhapsody International Inc. </p>
<p>This gives Microsoft a strong music story which they''ve
lacked for years and extends the Xbox brand to media and
entertainment, said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at market
research firm Gartner Inc. A free streaming service with ads
every 15 or 20 minutes is pretty compelling. This is will put a
lot of pressure on the Spotify''s, the Rdio''s and Pandora''s. </p>
<p>The application will also be available on new handsets with
Microsoft''s Windows Phone 8 software, coming in November. Mobile
apps for Apple''s iOS and Google Inc. (GOOG)''s Android are planned for
next year, Porter said. </p>
<p>Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft had already added
television and sports content to its Xbox Live service in a bid
to push into the consumer entertainment market. </p>
<h2>Single Platform </h2>
<p>Xbox Music features touch controls and the tile design of
Windows 8. It will also be the default music service on the
operating system. Customers who want to use the streaming
service without ads on PCs and tablets will also have to pay
$9.99 a month. </p>
<p>When a customer creates a playlist or downloads music on
one device such as a PC, the account is automatically updated if
they access it using a phone, tablet or Xbox because the data is
stored in the cloud. That''s an advance over Xbox Music''s
predecessor the Zune music service, Porter said. </p>
<p>Initially Xbox Music will lack some of the social features
seen in a service like Spotify, which tells users what music
their friends are listening to. While those will come next year,
Porter said, Microsoft is also mulling how to make those
features useful without spamming your friends with constant
notifications about a user''s listening choices. </p>
<p>The service will have a worldwide catalog of 30 million
tracks, and in the U.S. there will be 18 million tracks 
available. </p>

<p>Leaders from the world''s biggest
emerging markets are moving closer toward establishing a
development bank of their own, according to Goldman Sachs Asset
Management Chairman Jim O''Neill.
     The so-called BRICS nations of Brazil, Russia, India,
China and South Africa have spent the year considering an
Indian proposal for a multilateral bank that would be
exclusively funded by those nations and finance projects in
them. </p>
<p>While the Chinese have been scratching their head
about whether to support it, they may decide to if rich nations
continue to prove slow in backing a shift in voting power
toward emerging economies at the International Monetary Fund,
O''Neill told Tom Keene at the Bloomberg Link FX Summit in London
yesterday. </p>
<p>The Chinese could jump ship, said O''Neill, who devised
the BRIC term a decade ago. </p>
<p>The U.S. has so far failed to ratify a 2010 agreement that
would give more strength to emerging markets at the IMF and make
China the third most powerful member. Negotiations over a 2014
shift in voting rights are already subject to disagreement over
how to calculate the reshuffle. </p>
<p>O''Neill said China is shifting to a better quality of
growth from a previous focus on quantity, and its economy
will now expand between 6 percent and 8 percent. </p>
<p>China are telling us they''re happy to have less growth
going forward, said O''Neill, who added he expected more reform
to the nation''s economy and financial system. </p>
<h2>Growth Slowdown </h2>
<p>China will report this week that economic growth slowed to
7.4 percent in the third quarter, according to the median
estimate of a Bloomberg News survey of economists. That would be
the weakest annual pace in three years. </p>
<p>Turning to the euro area, O''Neill said equities in the
region remain very, very cheap. He argued that European
Central Bank President Mario Draghi sidelined the Bundesbank by
persuading German Chancellor Angela Merkel to back the bond-
buying program opposed by the country''s central bank chief, Jens Weidmann. </p>
<p>That reduced the Bundesbank to a protest group, O''Neill
said. Nobody has ignored the Bundesbank like that since the
Berlin Wall fell. </p>
<p>O''Neill said he still expects the Standard  Poor''s 500
Index to end the year at about 1500 and is confident lawmakers
will strike a deal to avert the so-called fiscal cliff of $607
billion in federal spending cuts and tax increases scheduled to
take effect in January unless the U.S. Congress acts. The index
was at 1454.55 yesterday in New York. </p>
<p>O''Neill, a former chief currency economist at Goldman
Sachs, said he sees the Australian dollar falling below $1. </p>
<p>I think the Aussie''s days above parity are numbered, he
said. I''d be in favor of the euro over the Aussie. </p>
<p>The Australian currency was 0.2 percent higher yesterday at
$1.0269 as of 5:52 p.m. London time. </p>

<p> International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the biggest computer-services company, fell as much as
3.8 percent in extended trading after reporting third-quarter
revenue that fell short of estimates as clients delayed orders. </p>
<p>The shares dropped 3.5 percent to $203.72 at 6:48 p.m. in
New York after trading as low as $203. The stock, which rose 1
percent to $211 at the close, has gained 15 percent this year. </p>
<p>Revenue dropped 5.4 percent to $24.7 billion, Armonk, New
York-based IBM said in a statement after the markets closed.
That missed the $25.4 billion average analyst estimate,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Profit excluding some
items rose 5 percent to $4.2 billion, or $3.62 a share. Analysts
on average predicted $3.61. </p>
<p>IBM cited an economic slowdown, especially in North
America, that caused software deals to be pushed back and kept
customers from signing up for business technology services
packages. Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty, in her first
year on the job, is working to combat weak economic growth by
expanding in emerging markets and shifting to higher-profit
software and services, like data analysis and cloud computing. </p>
<p>The actual macro environment must be weaker than we
thought, said Josh Olson, an analyst with Edward Jones  Co.
in Des Peres, Missouri. With biggest competitor Hewlett-Packard
Co. (HPQ) restructuring, you''d think there would be opportunity
there for some gains. The revenue was disappointing. </p>
<h2>Software Slowdown </h2>
<p>Net income was little changed at $3.82 billion, or $3.33 a
share. The quarter was especially weak in North America in the
final month of the quarter, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on a call with investors. </p>
<p>It was really a falloff that we saw in our GBS business,
number one, and in our software business, number two,
Loughridge said, referring to Global Business Services. He
attributed the software slowdown to a handful of deals that
didn''t take place. We thought we had those through the end of
the quarter, he said. </p>
<p>IBM said sales were hurt by the divestiture of the
company''s point-of-sale business to Toshiba Tec Corp. (6588), the
Japanese maker of scanners and bar-code machines, during the
quarter. The unit generated $1.15 billion in revenue last year.
IBM also was ordered to pay an extra $160 million in retirement-
related expenses in a ruling by the High Court in London,
according to an Oct. 12 regulatory filing. </p>
<h2>Currency Impact </h2>
<p>The U.S. dollar was 13 percent stronger than the euro on
average during the third quarter than a year earlier, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. That reduced the value of sales
from Europe, the Middle East and Africa, which were down 9
percent to $7.2 billion. Currency fluctuations hurt total sales
by $1 billion, IBM said. </p>
<p>IBM is betting on four areas to add $20 billion in
incremental revenue by 2015 as it shifts away from less-
profitable hardware. The areas include cloud computing, for
businesses to store data remotely on IBM servers; analytics
software, for businesses to make decisions based on data
analysis; smarter planet, for monitoring and improving
infrastructure like traffic and water systems; and emerging
markets, where the company plans to generate 30 percent of its
revenue by 2015. </p>
<p>Even in its shrinking hardware business, IBM is designing
solutions for new corporate needs. The company updated its
PureSystems storage and networking technology with products that
focus on business analytics. A new zEnterprise mainframe
computer works better with cloud software and storage. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth- biggest U.S. bank by assets, reported profit that beat analysts'' estimates on higher underwriting fees and a jump in the value of the firm''s own investments. </p> <p>Third-quarter net income of $1.51 billion, or $2.85 per share, compared with a loss of $393 million, or 84 cents, a year earlier, the New York-based bank said today in a statement. The average estimate of 25 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was $2.28 a share. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs, led by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 58, benefited from a rise in asset values that boosted the firm''s holdings of stock and debt, reversing a loss from a year earlier. Revenue from trading fixed-income, currency and commodities fell short of gains posted by JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Citigroup Inc. (C) </p> <p>The main driver of the earnings beat was basically larger mark-to-market type gains in their investing and lending division, said Richard Staite, an analyst at Atlantic Equities LLP in London who rates Goldman Sachs stock neutral. Trading revenue matched estimates, and given that JPMorgan and Citigroup performed better than expected, that could be a bit disappointing, Staite said. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs raised the quarterly dividend to 50 cents from 46 cents, the second increase this year. The shares, which climbed 3.6 percent yesterday, dropped 1 percent to $123.22 in New York trading at 4:15 p.m. Even after gaining 38 percent this year, the stock is below the firm''s theoretical liquidation value as investors wait to see whether returns will remain depressed by slow economic growth and regulatory constraints. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will sell its first computer, a device called Surface RT, for as little as $499 as the software maker pushes into the tablet market dominated by Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s iPad. </p> <p>The first iteration of the device, powered by a chip with technology from ARM Holdings Plc (ARM), will be available as a 32- gigabyte model for $499, the company said in a statement. With a black cover, it will cost $599, and a 64-gigabyte version will be $699. The machine goes on sale Oct. 26, and Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft will take a limited number of early online orders starting at 12 p.m. New York time today. </p> <p>The world''s largest software maker needed a device priced under $500 to lure customers away from the iPad and to compete with Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Google Inc. (GOOG), which are pushing prices lower in the tablet category, said Bob O''Donnell, an analyst at market-research firm IDC. The latest version of the iPad starts at $499 for a 16-gigabyte device that, like the Surface, uses a Wi-Fi short range wireless connection. </p> <p>Everything is pulling tablet prices down to below $500, so anything over $500 -- that is a tablet that is going to look expensive, he said. </p> <p>The snap-on cover, which includes a full keyboard, is one of the key features that make the Surface different from other tablets. Customers can buy the cover for $119.99 in black, white, magenta, cyan and red, according to the statement. </p> <h2>New Windows </h2> <p>Surface will be sold in Microsoft''s retail stores, including 34 temporary locations set up for the holidays. They''re also available online in the U.S., U.K., China, Germany, France, Hong Kong, Australia and Canada. </p> <p>The tablet has a 10.6-inch display and will run the new version of Microsoft''s operating system, which also goes on sale Oct. 26. </p> <p>The software maker is stepping up its assault on the tablet market as consumers choose the devices over laptops, weakening personal-computer sales and curbing Windows revenue. In the third quarter, total global PC shipments fell 8.3 percent from a year earlier to 87.5 million, market-research firm Gartner Inc. said last week. </p> <p>Since the iPad went on sale in April 2010, Apple has led the tablet market, which is predicted by DisplaySearch to reach $63.2 billion this year. Apple has 61 percent of the market, according to Gartner. Apple may introduce a smaller, less expensive version of the iPad at an event on Oct. 23, a person familiar with the matter said last week. </p> <p>Apple will probably price the iPad mini at $299 or $349, said Shaw Wu, an analyst at Sterne Agee  Leach Inc. An older version of the iPad sells for $399 in the U.S., according to the company''s website. </p> <p>Google''s Nexus 7 tablet and some versions of Amazon''s Kindle Fire with 7-inch screens cost $199. Amazon also sells a Fire with an 8.9-inch screen for $299. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Will Robinson" date="Oct 16, 2012 10:29 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-16/morgan-stanley-names-machen-co-head-of-north-america-bank-group.html"><headline>Morgan Stanley Names Machen Co-Head of North America Bank Group</headline><body><![CDATA[

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

<p>The Chinese auto-parts maker that
previously bailed out A123 Systems Inc. (AONE), the U.S. electric-car
battery maker that filed for bankruptcy protection this week,
said it''s still interested in taking over the company. </p>
<p>The bankruptcy filing may turn A123 into a more attractive
investment because the court proceedings would clear out legal
risks, Ni Pin, president of Wanxiang Group Corp.''s U.S.
operations, said in a phone interview yesterday. The automotive
business assets that A123 announced this week it would sell to
Johnson Controls Inc. (JCI) are separate from what Wanxiang had
targeted, Ni said. </p>
<p>Bankruptcy court is like a filter that lets a dirty big
boy covered with mud go through it and turn himself into a clean
boy, Ni said. Even though the boy may become smaller, he
doesn''t have the obligations he used to have. </p>
<p>A123, the recipient of a $249 million federal grant, said
that it scrapped the previous agreement with Wanxiang as it
filed for bankruptcy protection and agreed to sell its
automotive business assets to Johnson Controls. The Chinese
company, the nation''s biggest auto-parts maker, earlier this
year agreed to provide A123 with as much as $465 million in
loans and bonds convertible into an 80 percent stake. </p>
<p>Wanxiang''s deal was structured to protect itself against
A123''s potential bankruptcy, Ni said. Still, the court
proceedings may result in Wanxiang facing competing suitors,
which may drive up the cost of A123, he said. </p>
<p>The Johnson Controls deal doesn''t clash with Wanxiang
because the Chinese company is interested in all of A123, not
part of its assets, Ni said. </p>
<h2>Targeting China </h2>
<p>The earlier deal between the Chinese company and A123,
announced in August, had drawn opposition from Waltham,
Massachusetts-based Representative Cliff Stearns, a Florida
Republican, who cited possible national security concerns. </p>
<p>Ni said Wanxiang hasn''t faced any U.S. regulatory
opposition and that the company may have drawn attacks from
politicians because the deal came during an election year. </p>
<p>In a two-party system, they have to figure out an enemy
and China is the easiest one to target, Ni said. This is
just the reality. </p>
<p>The bankruptcy filing gave Republican Mitt Romney fresh
ammunition to criticize President Barack Obama''s record on the
economy. </p>
<p>A123''s bankruptcy is yet another failure for the
president''s disastrous strategy of gambling away billions of
taxpayer dollars on a strategy of government-led growth that
simply does not work, Andrea Saul, a Romney campaign
spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement this week. </p>
<h2>Orderly Sale'' </h2>
<p>Federal grants and loans to companies including A123,
Fisker Automotive Inc. and Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) have drawn scrutiny
from congressional Republicans following the September 2011
bankruptcy filing of solar-panel maker Solyndra LLC two years
after it received a $535 million loan guarantee from the U.S.
Energy Department. </p>
<p>For A123, this week''s move may pave the way for an
orderly sale of the company, it said in a statement. Johnson
Controls plans to acquire A123''s automotive-business assets in a
deal valued at $125 million and will provide financing of $72.5
million to support A123''s operations, according to the release. </p>
<p>The company listed assets of $459.8 million and debt of
$376 million as of Aug. 31 in Chapter 11 documents filed in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware. </p>
<h2>Financial Lifeline </h2>
<p>A123 needed a financial lifeline after struggling with
costs from a recall of batteries supplied to Fisker, the plug-in
hybrid luxury carmaker. Temporary relief came in August, when
the company announced a non-binding agreement with Wanxiang. </p>
<p>A123 Chief Executive Officer David Vieau said in this
week''s statement that the company scrapped its deal with the
Chinese company because of unanticipated and significant
challenges to its completion. </p>
<p>Johnson Controls plans to acquire A123''s automotive
business assets, including its facilities in Livonia and
Romulus, Michigan. The Milwaukee-based company also will obtain
A123''s cathode powder plant in China and its equity interest in
Shanghai Advanced Traction Battery Systems Co., A123''s joint
venture with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world''s largest energy company by market value, agreed to buy Celtic Exploration Ltd. (CLT) for C$2.86 billion ($2.92 billion) in cash and stock, adding oil and gas production in Canada''s Montney and Duvernay shale. </p> <p>Celtic''s holders will receive C$24.50 ($24.89) a share and half a share of a new company that will hold assets not included in the agreement, Calgary-based Celtic said today in a statement. The cash value per-share represents a 35 percent premium to Celtic''s closing price yesterday. </p> <p>The purchase is the largest by Exxon Mobil since its $35 billion takeover of XTO Energy in June 2010. It includes 545,000 net acres in the Montney shale and 104,000 acres in the Duvernay, fields where oil and natural gas are extracted by horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, so-called unconventional operations that were XTO''s specialty. </p> <p>This acquisition will add significant liquids-rich resources to our existing North American unconventional portfolio, Andrew Barry, president of Exxon Mobil Canada, said in a separate statement. Our financial and technical strength will enable us to maximize resource value by leveraging the experience of Exxon Mobil subsidiary XTO Energy. </p> <p>Current production on the acreage is 72 million cubic feet of gas a day and 4,000 barrels a day of oil and natural gas liquids. </p> <h2>Acreage Value </h2> <p>Exxon rose 1.1 percent to $93.39 at the close in New York. Celtic rose 45 percent to C$26.29 in Toronto, the biggest gain in more than 10 years. </p> <p>Exxon is paying about C$3,600 an acre for Celtic''s holdings, compared with C$2,800 an acre in Petroliam Nasional Bhd''s pending C$5.16 billion purchase of Progress Energy Resources Corp., Brook Papau, a Calgary-based energy-markets analyst for ITG Investment Research in Calgary, said today in a telephone interview. </p> <p>Celtic''s Duvernay production may be as much as half oil and other petroleum liquids by volume, prized because those sell at premiums to gas, Papau said. The area has been actively drilled, reducing the risk that the petroleum in place is lower than estimated, he said. </p> <p>Exxon may also eventually export liquefied natural gas to Asia from the Montney shale, where production is about 80 percent gas, Papau said. </p> <h2>LNG Exports </h2> <p>The company is looking at potential LNG export projects in western Canada and the U.S., Thomas Walters, president of Exxon Mobil Gas  Power Marketing Co., said Sept. 19 in an interview at an LNG conference in Tokyo. </p> <p>Exxon also may attempt to join export projects led by Apache Corp. (APA) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) that are planned in Kitimat, British Columbia, Papau said. </p> <p>The major oil companies are recognizing that Canada represents an enormous opportunity to build out their portfolios in unconventional resources such as shale, Gianna Bern, founder of Brookshire Advisory and Research Inc., a Chicago- based risk-management adviser to energy producers, said in an interview today. </p> <p>Western Canadian shale acreage is held in large blocks by small companies, making it attractive for major oil companies that can create value by accelerating drilling and locking in major supply lines to market, Papau said. </p> <h2>Unconventional Expertise </h2> <p>Exxon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson spent almost $40 billion during the past 28 months acquiring shale fields and the expertise to harvest them, including last month''s $2 billion agreement to buy drilling rights in North Dakota and Montana from Denbury Resources (DNR) Inc. </p> <p>In the past four weeks, Exxon has agreed to purchase drilling rights in shale and other unconventional formations spanning 845,000 acres, an area more than four times the size of New York City. </p> <p>Worldwide oil prices surged 20 percent since the end of 2010, enabling Exxon to expand its cash reserve by almost $10 billion to $17.8 billion at the end of the second quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p> <p>Exxon Mobil Canada will assume C$240 million of debt in the transaction, Sadiq H. Lalani, chief financial officer of Celtic, said today in a telephone interview. </p> <h2>New Company </h2> <p>In addition to cash for each share owned, each Celtic shareholder will get half a share of the new company led by Lalani and David J. Wilson, Celtic''s CEO. The company will have daily production equivalent to 3,300 barrels of oil a day and will have assets in Alberta and British Columbia. </p> <p>The new company will own property for which Exxon and Celtic couldn''t agree on a value, Lalani said in an interview. So it made more sense for us to keep that, he said. </p> <p>Net asset value of the new company is C$2.32 a share, Celtic said in its statement. </p> <p>Celtic used no financial advisers, Lalani said. FirstEnergy Capital Corp. and RBC Capital Markets provided fairness opinions, according to the statement. </p> <p>The deal has been unanimously approved by Celtic''s board and is subject to a C$90 million termination fee, paid by Celtic, if it isn''t completed under certain conditions. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Dina Bass" date="Oct 17, 2012  2:05 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-17/microsoft-may-have-sold-out-of-499-surface-ordered-early-online.html"><headline>Microsoft May Have Sold Out of $499 Surface Ordered Early Online</headline><body><![CDATA[

<p>Coca-Cola Co. (KO) and Sanofi (SAN) set up a
joint venture to sell health drinks at French pharmacies, a
pilot project to test demand for beverages with beauty claims. </p>
<p>The beverages, called Beautific and sold under the brand
name Oenobiol, will be available within months, the two
companies said in separate statements. Coca-Cola, the world''s
largest soft-drink maker, will handle formulation and Sanofi
will oversee distribution, according to the French drugmaker. </p>
<p>Sanofi is looking to diversify to reduce its reliance on
prescription drugs while Coca-Cola faces pressure to offer
healthier beverages amid rising obesity rates. The first four
drinks will help with hair, weight loss, sun exposure and
general vitality, according to a Sanofi presentation obtained by
Bloomberg. The product, designed to appeal to active urban women
aged 25 to 45, will cost between 2 euros ($2.60) and 3 euros a
bottle, the document shows. </p>
<p>The blockbuster model is broken, and drugmakers have been
turning to consumer health-care, Pierre Corby, an analyst at
Aurel BGC in Paris, said in a phone interview. </p>
<p>Sanofi Chief Executive Officer Chris Viehbacher has been
reshaping the French company since he took over almost four
years ago. The 52-year-old CEO has been expanding in animal
health as well as consumer products as its top medicines,
including the blood-thinner Plavix, face generic competition. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola and Sanofi will own 50 percent of the venture,
Sanofi said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<h2>Gold Bond Powder </h2>
<p>Sanofi''s consumer health-care business has been growing
through purchases, such as the 2010 acquisition of Chattem Inc.,
the U.S. maker of Gold Bond medicated powder. The company
acquired Laboratoire Oenobiol, a French maker of nutritional
beauty supplements, three years ago. Sales of consumer goods,
which Sanofi touts as one of its growth platforms, rose 23
percent to 2.7 billion euros ($3.54 billion) last year. </p>
<p>At the same time, Viehbacher has been cutting internal
research, ending the least promising projects and lowering
headcount. In France, a new plan to eliminate about 900 jobs by
2015 has drawn criticism from politicians and unions. </p>
<p>Today''s announcement is an example of how Sanofi''s identity
is changing under Viehbacher, unions said. </p>
<p>They presented this project to our sales forces as if it
were the height of innovation, Thierry Bodin, a union
representative, said in a telephone interview. We are
concerned about trying to get new medicines to patients, and
Sanofi''s management is only worried about making money, in this
case with beauty products. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)''s largest-ever
Canadian acquisition is fueling speculation that domestic
companies with assets in Alberta''s shale-gas fields will become
takeover targets. </p>
<p>Shares of Artek Exploration Ltd. (RTK), Cequence Energy Ltd. (CQE) and
NuVista Energy Ltd. (NVA) all surged yesterday after Exxon agreed to
pay $2.86 billion ($2.91 billion) for Celtic Exploration Ltd. (CLT)''s
leases in the Duvernay and Montney shale formations that span an
area twice the size of Los Angeles. Larger firms such as
Tourmaline Oil Corp. (TOU) and Paramount Resources Ltd. (POU) also climbed. </p>
<p>The deal helps externally verify the Duvernay formation
as being one of the best liquids-rich plays in Canada, said
Randy Eresman, chief executive officer of  Encana Corp. (ECA),
Canada''s largest gas producer. </p>
<p>The Duvernay shale, which is soaked in natural gas as well
as petroleum liquids such as propane and ethane, which fetch
higher prices, may rival the mammoth Eagle Ford formation in
south Texas, Eresman said in an interview yesterday in his
Calgary office.  The Eagle Ford holds the equivalent of 25
billion barrels of crude, according to ITG Investment Research,
or enough to supply North American crude demand for 3 years. </p>
<p>The major oil companies are recognizing that Canada
represents an enormous opportunity to build out their portfolios
in unconventional resources such as shale, Gianna Bern,
founder of Brookshire Advisory and Research Inc., a Chicago-
based risk-management adviser to energy producers, said in an
interview yesterday. </p>
<h2>Large Blocks </h2>
<p>In western Canada, drilling rights often are held in large
blocks by small companies, making it easier for major
international explorers to snap up significant holdings without
having to deal with thousands of individual landowners, as they
must in U.S. shale regions such as Ohio and Louisiana, said
Brook Papau, an analyst at ITG Investment in Calgary. </p>
<p>The C$24.50 a share Exxon will pay amounts to a 35 percent
premium to Celtic''s Oct. 16 closing price. With 76 percent of
the reserves to be acquired comprised of gas, Exxon is wagering
that a cold North American winter and expanding use of gas in
place of coal at power plants will lift prices that touched a
decade-low in April, said Chris Kettenmann, an analyst at
Phoenix Partners Group LP. </p>
<p>Artek rose 23 percent to C$2.98 yesterday in Toronto. It
dropped to C$2.90 at market close today after announcing it sold
shares to banks and brokerages. Cequence climbed 12 percent
yesterday and was little changed today, while NuVista added 6.6
percent, bringing its two-day gains to 20 percent. All three are
based in Calgary. Tourmaline added 6.6 percent yesterday and was
little changed today while Paramount rose 8 percent over the
last two days. </p>
<h2>Face Challenges </h2>
<p>Encana is seeking a partner to develop its Duvernay
acreage, one of a handful of joint venture packages the company
is marketing. He expects at least one deal to close by
year''s end, Eresman said. </p>
<p>This just shows the value embedded in the acreage, not
just this deal, Eric Nuttall of Sprott Asset Management in
Toronto said in a telephone interview yesterday. </p>
<p>Exxon is not alone in the shale fields that span parts of
Alberta and nearby provinces such as British Columbia and the
Yukon. Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), the world''s third-largest energy
company by market value after Exxon and PetroChina, has been
prospecting in the Duvernay shale since 2008. Chevron Corp. (CVX) also
has holdings there. </p>
<p>Duvernay explorers may face challenges in making the
prospect competitive with other North American fields. Duvernay
wells cost about C$12 million each to drill, Sveinung Svarte,
chief executive officer at Athabasca Oil Corp. (ATH), said in a
conference call with analysts Oct. 16. That''s about 36 percent
more than the $9 million Continental Resources Corp. said last
week it was spending on wells in a new discovery called the
South Central Oklahoma Oil Province, or SCOOP. </p>
<h2>Amassing Acreage </h2>
<p>The cash-and-stock deal with Celtic is the Irving, Texas-
based company''s largest in Canada since the 1999 merger of Exxon
and Mobil Corp., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The economic and environmental advantages of natural gas
are clear - and markets around the world will increasingly seek
this cleaner burning source of energy to fuel progress and
prosperity, Andrew Swiger, an Exxon senior vice president said
in a speech last month. With North America''s abundant
supplies, natural gas will be a valued contributor to jobs and
energy security in Canada, the United States, and around the
world. </p>
<p>Exxon probably is most keen on the Duvernay shale portion
of the Celtic transaction, said Nuttall, who oversees C$110
million at Sprott. The U.S. energy explorer is unlikely to
attempt to ship any of the gas produced in the Duvernay or
Montney areas to Canada''s west coast for export as liquefied
natural gas, or LNG, as it would require the construction of a
pipeline over mountains at a cost of $1 billion, he said. </p>
<h2>Too Dense </h2>
<p>Exxon has been amassing shale acreage from south Texas to
the Yukon Territory after spending almost $35 billion in 2010
for XTO Energy''s gas fields and shale-drilling experts.
Benchmark gas futures traded in New York have risen 16 percent
this year, on track for the first annual gain in a half decade. </p>
<p>It''s clear prices are going higher, Kettenmann said in
a telephone interview from New York yesterday. Exxon is
following through on the bet they made with XTO.'' </p>
<p>Exxon, which has been drilling for oil and gas in Canada
for more than seven decades, will acquire rights to 104,000 net
acres in the Duvernay and 545,000 acres in the Montney Shale.
Exxon has been deploying XTO engineers versed in horizontal
drilling and hydraulic fracturing to crack open shale formations
from Argentina to the Northwest Territories. </p>
<p>Exxon already held vast leases in other so-called
unconventional gas and oil prospects across western Canada,
including the Horn River Basin and the Cardium and Viking
fields. Unconventional prospects are geologic formations such as
shale that are too dense or non-porous to be tapped without
intensive drilling and fracturing techniques. </p>
<p>In the past four weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Rex Tillerson agreed to spend almost $5 billion in cash,
stock and asset swaps to expand Exxon''s North American shale
holdings, including the deal announced yesterday. On Sept. 20,
Exxon disclosed a $2 billion deal for Denbury Resources Inc. (DNR)''s
acreage in the Bakken shale of North Dakota and Montana. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world''s largest
soft drink maker, authorized a new plan to buy back 500 million
shares, valued at about $18.9 billion at yesterday''s closing
price, as it returns cash to investors. </p>
<p>The new authorization doesn''t affect the plan to buy back
$2.5 billion to $3 billion in stock this year, the Atlanta-based
company said today in a statement. Coca-Cola said its current
repurchase program was authorized in 2006. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola has risen 48 percent since Chief Executive
Officer Muhtar Kent took over in July 2008, compared with an 9.9
percent gain for rival PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) Kent has pledged to reach
$200 billion in revenue for the company and its bottlers
globally by 2020, double the sales generated in 2010. </p>
<p>This company is in a good spot -- they don''t know what to
do with all their cash except to give it back to shareholders,
Jack Russo, an analyst with Edward Jones  Co. in St. Louis,
said in a telephone interview. They''ve been active share
repuchasers for a long time. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola rose 0.3 percent to $37.84 at the close in New
York. The shares have gained 8.2 percent this year. </p>
<p>Directors also declared a quarterly dividend of 25.5 cents,
payable Dec. 17 to shareholders of record as of Nov. 30. The
company completed a 2-for-1 share split in August. </p>
<p>The company had $18.1 billion in cash and equivalents as of
Sept. 28. Coca-Cola authorized the repurchase of as many as 300
million shares in 2006. </p>
<p>Kent has adjusted prices and introduced new products to
cope with weaker demand in European nations facing a persistent
debt crisis and slowing growth in China and Brazil. Earlier this
week, the company reported a 3.9 percent increase in third-
quarter profit as sales volumes in Europe improved. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), the sixth-largest U.S. bank, reported third-quarter results that beat analysts'' estimates as revenue from fixed-income trading almost doubled from the second quarter. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley posted a loss of $1.01 billion, or 55 cents a share, compared with a profit of $2.2 billion, or $1.15, a year earlier, the New York-based firm said today in a statement. Excluding accounting adjustments and a one-time restructuring cost, profit was about 35 cents a share, compared with the 25- cent average estimate of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. </p> <p>Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, 54, is trying to improve returns at the brokerage unit and shrink the fixed- income trading division to reduce capital demands. The bank had the lowest first-half return on equity among the 10 largest U.S. lenders and trades at two-thirds of its liquidation value, compared with 96 percent at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p> <p>The rebound in fixed-income and commodities sales and trading indicates that clients have re-engaged after the uncertainty of the rating review in the previous quarter, Gorman said in the statement, referring to Moody''s Investors Service''s two-level downgrade of Morgan Stanley''s credit rating in June. </p>

<p>European policy makers who think
Spain and Italy won''t need aid or new fiscal programs now that
their debt costs have dropped are misreading the markets,
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s Jacob Frenkel said. </p>
<p>The drop in sovereign interest rates doesn''t mean the
crisis is over, and outside aid won''t work without a program to
fix underlying causes, said Frenkel, chairman of JPMorgan Chase
International, in an interview on Bloomberg Television''s In
the Loop. </p>
<p>The reason why yields have declined is because the market
expects them to have the program, Frenkel said. The issue is
not just financing, it is adjustment, and if they don''t do the
adjustment, the financing will just be throwing good money after
bad. </p>
<p>Spain sold more debt than planned and yields on Spanish 10-
year bonds fell to a six-month low last week after Moody''s
Investors Service affirmed the nation''s credit rating on signs
that policy makers will seek aid. Italian bond yields also
dropped to their lowest levels since March last week, although
they have since erased that decline. </p>
<p>Frenkel said the so-called fiscal cliff, the automatic
increase in U.S. taxes and spending cuts that will take effect
unless Congress reaches a compromise, is the biggest threat to
the U.S. economy. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, set aside $5.2 billion in the first nine
months of 2012 to pay investment-bank employees, a 9 percent
decline from a year earlier. </p>
<p>The ratio of compensation to revenue in the unit fell to
44.9 percent, compared with 48.4 percent in the same period a
year earlier, when excluding accounting gains and losses related
to the firm''s credit spreads. That''s still higher than Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s investment bank.
Compensation and benefits for all of Morgan Stanley totaled $12
billion in the first nine months, down 4 percent. </p>
<p>Pay expenses at the institutional-securities unit, which
includes salaries, bonuses, benefits and the cost of deferred
pay for bankers and traders, were $1.6 billion in the third
quarter, an 8 percent increase from a year earlier, the New
York-based company said today on its website. </p>
<p>The world''s biggest banks are cutting costs amid concerns
that the global economy will slow revenue growth and new capital
rules will depress returns. Morgan Stanley Chief Executive
Officer James Gorman, 54, said in an interview with the
Financial Times published earlier this month that Wall Street
employees are still overpaid. </p>
<h2>Job Cuts </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley, which said in July it planned to reduce
more than 700 positions during the rest of the year, eliminated
901 jobs in the quarter ended Sept. 30. In the past 12 months
the company shed 4,519 employees, or 7 percent of its workforce,
from job cuts and unit sales. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the largest U.S. lender by assets, cut
compensation expenses at its investment bank by 9.4 percent in
the first nine months of the year as the business generated 7.1
percent less revenue. It was enough to give each of the
division''s 25,884 employees $269,703. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs set aside almost $11 billion to pay employees
in the first nine months of the year, up 10 percent from the
same period in 2011 as revenue climbed. Goldman Sachs''s cost was
equivalent to $336,441 for each of its 32,600 workers as of
Sept. 30. </p>
<p>Wall Street firms typically reserve a portion of revenue
throughout the year for employees. Average pay per worker
doesn''t reflect the amount of money employees actually receive.
Top executives and revenue producers sometimes receive
multimillion-dollar awards, while clerical workers get smaller
salaries. </p>
<h2>Companywide Compensation </h2>
<p>Adjusted for accounting gains and losses related to the
firm''s credit spreads, known as debt-valuation adjustments or
DVA, revenue at the Morgan Stanley''s institutional-securities
unit fell 1.27 percent to $11.5 billion in the nine months. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s companywide compensation, the firm''s
largest expense, was enough to pay each of its 57,726 employees
$207,757 for the nine months, up from $201,542 for each of the
62,245 employees at the end of the third quarter of 2011,
according to figures released today. The bank doesn''t report how
many people work in institutional securities. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s brokerage division, which employed 16,829
financial advisers at the end of September, set aside $6.15
billion for pay in the nine months, down 1 percent from a year
earlier. The unit''s compensation cost, which is set by a fixed
grid for some employees, was 61 percent of the division''s
revenue, down from 62 percent last year. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) sought to profit last year by persuading clients to buy and sell stock options on European banks such as BNP Paribas SA (BNP) and UniCredit SpA (UCG), according to former employee Greg Smith''s new book. </p> <p>We must have changed our view on each of these institutions from positive to negative back to positive ten times, Smith writes in  Why I Left Goldman Sachs: A Wall Street Story, scheduled for release on Oct. 22. I remember thinking, How can we be doing this with a straight face? No thinking client could believe that conditions on the ground could change that frequently.'' </p> <p>Smith, a South African who graduated from Stanford University, is the first former employee to write a critical account of his career at New York-based Goldman Sachs. The 143- year-old firm was once the most profitable on Wall Street and counts among its alumni two former U.S. Treasury secretaries and the European Central Bank president. Excerpts of the book were published yesterday by Politico. </p> <p>Smith, who said he moved to London from New York to run the U.S. equity-derivatives business in Europe, doesn''t explain in the book how he knows that Goldman Sachs was trying to get clients to trade European bank options. Prices of European bank stocks and other assets fluctuated during the year amid the region''s sovereign debt crisis. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) is releasing its largest set of security products ever as
the company seeks new business amid slowing revenue. </p>
<p>IBM, which disappointed investors this week by reporting
that sales fell in the third quarter, said today it has 10 new
products that will help it gain ground in the market for
business security software, where spending will rise to $21
billion in 2013, according to Gartner Research. </p>
<p>For IBM it really is a significant increase in focus on
the whole area of security, said Brendan Hannigan, general
manager of IBM''s security systems division. We''ve got a large
security sales force. We have a channel organization that will
help package the capabilities together. </p>
<p>IBM is releasing products that will help companies control
employees'' mobile devices, mitigate threats from the Internet
and in data centers, and automate some security management. The
company is betting that a wider product portfolio will help it
win business from niche competitors. </p>
<p>The Armonk, New York-based company formed its security
division earlier this year, urged by clients who are adding
security officers in top management positions to combat the
growing threat of cybercrime. Companies are storing data
remotely and retrieving the information with mobile devices,
increasing the points of entry for potential theft. </p>
<p>IBM declined 4.9 percent yesterday to $200.63 as investors
reacted to third-quarter revenue, which fell short of
expectations. Revenue dropped 5.4 percent to $24.7 billion, the
company said, missing the $25.4 billion average analyst
estimate. </p>

<p>JPMorgan raised a $409.8 million fund for BlueMountain in

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), squeezed along
with other money-market fund providers by low interest rates,
has become the first to prepare investors for negative yields
from funds that maintain a constant net-asset value. </p>
<p>Constant NAV share classes of the 3.84 billion euro ($5
billion) JPMorgan Euro Government Liquidity Fund (JPMEGAA) and the 13.5
billion euro Euro Liquidity Fund (JPMEULC) will be replaced next month
with new share classes that allow the funds to maintain their
stable value by taking shares from investors, causing them to
lose money, the New York-based bank said yesterday in a
statement. The firm is giving customers until Nov. 18 to switch
to the new share class, to a floating-value share class or
redeem shares. </p>
<p>It''s not that we think negative yields are imminent, but
we want to be prepared, Robert Deutsch, JPMorgan''s head of
global liquidity, said today in a telephone interview. He said
some institutional investors, to which the funds cater, have
signaled they would still use the fund if yields turn negative. </p>
<p>Euro-denominated money funds have been extending the
maturity of holdings, broadening their assets, waiving fees and
turning away clients to prevent record low interest rates from
pushing investor returns below zero. Rate cuts prompted
JPMorgan, BlackRock Inc. (BLK) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) to close
or restrict deposits to euro money funds. The European Central
Bank cut its deposit rate to zero on July 5, pushing down yields
on the short-term debt to which money funds are restricted. </p>
<h2>Promising Avenue'' </h2>
<p>Small funds are likely to liquidate should yields turn
negative while large ones will try to accommodate their
investors, and this looks like the most promising avenue for
that, Peter Crane, president of research firm Crane Data LLC
in Westborough, Massachusetts, said in an interview, referring
to the JPMorgan announcement. </p>
<p>The average seven-day yield on funds that buy euro-
denominated government securities was at zero percent for the
week ended Oct. 12, according to research firm iMoneyNet, also
based in Westborough, Massachusetts. The average yield on euro
funds eligible to purchase corporate debt was 0.05 percent. </p>
<p>No constant NAV cash product has ever returned a negative
yield to investors, according to JPMorgan''s Deutsch. </p>
<p>The share prices of funds with floating values would
decline if investment returns fail to exceed fees fund managers
impose on clients. The same scenario would cause a constant NAV
product to break the buck, as it''s known in the U.S., where
money-fund share prices are kept at $1. </p>
<h2>Reserve Primary </h2>
<p>The $62.5 billion Reserve Primary Fund was forced to shut
down in September 2008 after losses on debt issued by Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. caused the fund to fall below $1 a share.
That triggered a run on the industry and efforts by regulators
to overhaul fund rules in the U.S. </p>
<p>To avoid breaking the buck, JPMorgan is rewriting the
prospectuses of the two Luxembourg-registered funds and adding
share classes that allow the funds to reverse the normal process
by which constant NAV investors receive returns. </p>
<p>Those funds typically maintain a steady share value by
distributing new shares as investment earnings cause total
assets to rise. The JPMorgan funds would automatically reduce
the number of shares by taking some away from all investors if
total assets drop, an action that isn''t allowed under current
fund rules. </p>
<p>At the time you redeem, you may get back less than you
originally invested, the company said in the statement. </p>
<p>JPMorgan was the second-biggest provider of money funds
with $372 billion in assets worldwide as of Sept. 30, according
to Crane Data. Fidelity was the largest with $422 billion. </p>

<p>Microsoft (MSFT) Corp. and Advanced Micro
Devices Inc. (AMD) declined after reporting quarterly results that
fell short of analysts'' predictions as competition from tablets
and global economic weakness squeeze sales. </p>
<p>Microsoft, the largest software maker, reported fiscal
first quarter sales and profit yesterday that missed estimates
on declining sales of Windows, its flagship operating system.
AMD, the No. 2 maker of PC processors, forecast fourth-quarter
sales that may miss projections and said it will cut 15 percent
of staff. Chipmaker Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL) dropped after
cutting its fiscal third quarter revenue forecast. </p>
<p>Following Intel Corp. (INTC)''s results earlier in the week showing
margins under pressure, yesterday''s reports underscored the
impact of slowing international growth and a shift away from
traditional computers toward handheld electronics. Some
customers also put off PC purchases before the debut of the next
version of Microsoft''s flagship Windows operating system. </p>
<p>I don''t think people are expecting a big bounce in terms
of PC sales for the fourth quarter, said Colin Gillis, an
analyst at BGC Partners LP in New York. </p>
<p>Shares of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft fell 2.9
percent to $28.64 at the close in New York. The stock has gained
10 percent this year. </p>
<h2>Shares Plunge </h2>
<p>Sunnyvale, California-based AMD -- the worst performer on
the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index this year, with a decline
of 60 percent this year -- dropped 17 percent to $2.18, its
lowest price since March 2009. Marvell retreated 14 percent to
$7.57, also the lowest price since March 2009. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s net income declined 22 percent to $4.47
billion, or 53 cents a share, in the three months through Sept.
30, it said in a statement. That missed the 56-cent average
estimate of analysts polled by Bloomberg. Sales fell 7.9 percent
to $16 billion, compared with the $16.4 billion average
estimate. </p>
<p>During the quarter, global PC shipments slumped 8.3 percent
from a year earlier to 87.5 million units, market-research firm
Gartner Inc. said last week. The total PC market will contract
by 1.2 percent to 348.7 million units this year, according to
IHS ISuppli. That''s the first annual decline since 2001, the
market researcher said last week. </p>
<p>Although holiday sales usually kick in this time of year,
AMD is expecting revenue to fall 9 percent, plus or minus 4
percent, in the current quarter from the prior period, the
company said yesterday in a statement. That indicates sales as
low as $1.1 billion, compared with an average analyst estimate
of $1.31 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Marvell Forecast </h2>
<p>Marvell, a Hamilton, Bermuda registered company with
operations in California, said revenue for the fiscal third
quarter, which ends Oct. 27, will be $765 million to $785
million, down from an earlier prediction of $800 million to $850
million, as lower PC demand hurt orders of chips that run hard
disk drives. Marvell also said Chief Financial Officer Clyde
Hosein resigned after four years at the company, and named Brad
Feller, vice president and corporate comptroller, as an interim
replacement. </p>
<p>Microsoft is betting on Windows 8, which goes on sale next
week, to lift demand for PCs and get consumers to purchase
tablet machines running Windows rather than Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s iOS or
Google Inc. (GOOG)''s Android. Alongside tablets from its computer-maker
partners, Microsoft will begin selling Surface, a tablet machine
that marks the company''s first foray into computer hardware. </p>
<h2>Windows Slump </h2>
<p>Sales of Windows declined 33 percent to $3.24 billion,
missing the average analyst estimate of $3.64 billion. Business
Division sales, mostly Office software, fell 2.4 percent.
Microsoft is betting on Windows 8 to vault it into the tablet
market and restore consumer demand. </p>
<p>The Microsoft numbers are a little worse than expected,
but for Wall Street, it''s all about Windows 8, said Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. These are
not substantially off enough to change the fact that people are
largely going to shrug it off and look towards the launch of
Windows 8 to see how that goes. </p>
<p>Multiyear contracts, which Microsoft reports as unearned
revenue, blunted the impact in the latest quarter and boosted
investor optimism for future quarters. Demand from corporate
customers upgrading their server software and paying off
multiyear contracts translated into unearned revenue, a measure
of future sales, of $19.6 billion. That''s better than analysts''
average estimate of $19.3 billion, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Corporate Purchases </h2>
<p>Although corporate PC purchases, which have been shoring up
results for the last several quarters, have slowed, they have
performed better than the consumer market, Microsoft Chief
Financial Officer Peter Klein said in an interview. </p>
<p>Microsoft said a weaker economy, particularly in Europe, is
causing companies to put off one-time purchases of its software.
At the same time, corporate customers continue to sign multiyear
agreements, with such licenses rising 15 percent in the quarter,
he said. </p>
<p>Poor PC demand and the shift to tablet machines has been
ailing Microsoft''s Windows unit for almost two years. Windows
revenue has fallen short of analysts'' estimates in six of the
last eight quarters. </p>
<h2>Xbox Beats </h2>
<p>Klein declined in an interview and conference call to
provide an outlook for Windows sales in the current quarter and
full year. He also didn''t adjust the cost of goods sold numbers
to account for Surface, explaining to analysts that the company
will just see how the device sells first. </p>
<p>Server unit sales rose 8 percent to $4.55 billion. Although
Xbox division sales declined slightly to $1.95 billion, they
beat the average analysts'' estimate of $1.62 billion, as Xbox
remained the top-selling console in the U.S. </p>
<p>The online business saw sales increase 8.7 percent to $697
million, while analysts had expected an average of $689 million,
as the company boosted average revenue per search. Microsoft
also narrowed the loss in that unit to $364 million. </p>
<p>Underlining the relative success of mobile phones and
tablets at the expense of PCs, SanDisk Corp. (SNDK), a maker of flash
memory chips which store files in handheld devices, reported
sales and profit that beat estimates yesterday. </p>
<p>Shares of the Milpitas, California-based company advanced
2.7 percent to $44.02, and earlier gained as much as 9.3
percent. </p>

The idea of the op-ed was not to do any destruction. </p> <p>About $2.15 billion was wiped from Goldman Sachs''s market value the day the New York Times published Smith''s article, which threatened to reignite political and popular distrust of Wall Street in general and Goldman Sachs in particular. Goldman Sachs responded by saying that surveys found most employees believed the firm treated clients well. The stock price, which recovered within a week as the company promised to investigate Smith''s assertions, is up 38 percent this year to $124.42. </p> <p>As we looked into his claims I was very pleased to see there wasn''t merit, Edith Cooper, 51, Goldman Sachs''s global head of human capital management, said today on Bloomberg Television''s Market Makers with Erik Schatzker and Stephanie Ruhle. My biggest disappointment in this is that Greg Smith didn''t come forward and speak to us. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley Chief Executive
Officer James Gorman is set to lose stock once valued at almost
$2.9 million as the bank misses profitability and share-
performance goals. </p>
<p>Gorman, 54, probably will forfeit so-called performance-
based stock units awarded in 2009 that required the New York-
based firm earn a 12 percent average return on equity and have
shareholder gains ranking in the top half of a 10-company group
during his first three years as CEO. He could have earned shares
worth almost $6 million if he exceeded those goals. </p>
<p>Instead, Morgan Stanley has produced an ROE of less than 6
percent with one quarter remaining and ranks ninth in its peer
group in terms of shareholder return, beating only Credit Suisse
Group AG. Gorman, who''s criticized Wall Street pay as too high,
has pledged to improve results, in part by shrinking fixed-
income trading and buying the rest of a brokerage joint venture. </p>
<p>With pay for performance, you don''t always get paid,
said Rose Marie Orens, a senior partner at New York-based
Compensation Advisory Partners LLC. If you always got paid,
we''d have to wonder how you stacked the deck. This plan is not a
walk in the park, it sounds like they really did set up a
performance plan that made sense. </p>
<p>Colm Kelleher, 55, who now oversees the firm''s trading
division, received performance-based stock units, or PSUs,
valued at $2.36 million, according to the bank''s 2010 proxy
filing. Ken deRegt, 56, then-chief risk officer who now runs
fixed-income trading, got $1.87 million of PSUs. </p>
<h2>Shareholder''s Vote </h2>
<p>While executives don''t like missing out on the payments,
the plan shows investors the bank is committed to rewarding real
performance, Orens said. Citigroup Inc. faced criticism after
then-CEO Vikram Pandit, 55, who resigned this week, had his pay
package rejected by shareholders in a nonbinding vote in April. </p>
<p>Directors had awarded Pandit about $15 million in total
compensation for 2011 and granted him a separate, multiyear
retention package that was potentially worth $40 million.
Citigroup shares slumped 44 percent in the year, prompting more
than half of shareholders to oppose the executive compensation. </p>
<p>About 95 percent of Morgan Stanley (MS) shareholders approved
the firm''s executive compensation for 2011, in which Gorman''s
pay was cut by a quarter to $10.5 million and included $1.94
million of PSUs. The $2.85 million in PSUs, now worth $1.73
million as the firm''s share price has decreased, were part of a
$15 million pay package for 2009. </p>
<h2>Still Overpaid'' </h2>
<p>Banks haven''t cut compensation enough when faced with
falling profits and the industry is still overpaid, Gorman
said in an interview with the Financial Times published this
month. Morgan Stanley will consider a new round of cost-cutting
next year, and that could include lower pay, Gorman told the FT. </p>
<p>Gorman bought 100,000 shares of Morgan Stanley in August
2011 as a sign of confidence after the stock dropped 19 percent
in two weeks. He owns 1.18 million shares, according to a
regulatory filing, valued at $21 million at yesterday''s closing
price. </p>
<p>Gorman could still receive a fraction of the 2009 award. He
would get one-eighth of the shares if Morgan Stanley exceeds the
total shareholder return of another bank to move into eighth
place in the group. Morgan Stanley has slid about 40 percent
since the end of 2009. Bank of America Corp. (BAC), which has dropped
about 38 percent, is the only firm within 10 percentage points
of Morgan Stanley''s decline. </p>
<h2>Public Scrutiny </h2>
<p>He could receive an additional one-eighth of the award if
the firm''s ROE averages 7.5 percent over the three years,
excluding the effect of accounting adjustments related to Morgan
Stanley''s own credit spreads, known as DVA. The bank would have
to earn more than $5 billion in the fourth quarter to reach that
mark, a total larger than it produced in the previous two years
combined. </p>
<p>Wesley McDade, a Morgan Stanley spokesman, declined to
comment on Gorman''s compensation. </p>
<p>The macroeconomic environment has probably been worse than
the bank anticipated when it set the goals, said Joseph Sorrentino, a managing director at Steven Hall  Partners, a
compensation-consulting firm in New York. Still, given the
public scrutiny surrounding Wall Street pay, the company must
stick to targets, he said. </p>
<p>If you''re talking about senior executives, modifying
those goals after the fact in today''s environment is just not
possible, Sorrentino said. </p>
<h2>Tweaking Metrics </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley did tweak the metrics in subsequent years''
awards. Gorman was given $1.94 million of the PSUs for each of
the past two years. </p>
<p>For 2010, the bank placed a larger weight on ROE earned in
2013 than in 2011. In last year''s deal, Morgan Stanley lowered
the benchmark for ROE to 10 percent and excluded certain sales
of businesses and legal costs. The bank also replaced the group
of rival firms with a comparison to the 81-company Standard 
Poor''s 500 Financials Index. (S5FINL) </p>
<p>Some top Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) executives will be beneficiaries
of awards tied to performance, as they''re set to receive payouts
almost double the original amount. The San Francisco-based bank
gave CEO John Stumpf, 59, and other executives retention bonuses
in December 2009 tied to the firm earning a higher ROE than half
the lenders in the KBW Bank Index (BKX) for the three years ended
2012. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo is poised to finish in the top quartile of the
24-company index on that measure, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg, meaning the executives would get 1.5 times the amount
of stock they were originally set to receive. For Stumpf, that
means he''d get shares valued at $19.7 million from a bonus that
was originally worth $10.3 million. </p>
<h2>Deferred Bonus </h2>
<p>Bank of America and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) have also
given executives bonuses tied to future performance. Bank of
America CEO Brian T. Moynihan, 53, and his deputies received
PSUs for 2010 and last year that are based on reaching a return-
on-assets target at some point between 2011 and 2016. Moynihan
received his entire $9.05 million bonus in the PSUs for 2010. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs in February 2011 gave its named executives,
including CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein, 58, a performance-tied
deferred cash bonus of $7 million separate from year-end pay.
The full bonus would be given if the firm averaged a 10 percent
ROE and 7 percent growth in book value per share over three
years. The company can decide by the end of December to extend
by five years the period in which it can achieve those goals. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs gave a similar bonus of $3 million in
February. </p>
<p>They''ve become quite common, and they are very much a
response to the feeling that given how our shareholders fared,
we need to have something in our pay program that demonstrates
financial performance, Orens said. </p>

<p>Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G) moved
Managing Director Sergio Balbinot to the new position of chief
insurance officer as Chief Executive Officer Mario Greco
shuffles management after taking charge of Italy''s largest
insurer. </p>
<p>Balbinot, 54, will lead insurance activities worldwide,
reporting to Greco, the Trieste, Italy-based insurer said in a
statement today. Generali also created a 10-member management
committee that will be led by Greco, have Balbinot as deputy,
and include the heads of Italy, France and Germany as well as
other top executives. </p>
<p>Greco, 53, named CEO in June to replace Giovanni Perissinotto, 58, is realigning management to spur profit
growth, strengthen capital and smooth relations with investors.
Balbinot''s shift follows the appointment of Alberto Minali as
chief financial officer last month to replace Raffaele Agrusti,
who became country manager for Italy. </p>
<p>Today''s announcement marks the completion of the review
of Generali''s organizational structure, said Greco in the
statement. We want to refocus on the core insurance business
at an international level and therefore begin to enhance our
internal capabilities. </p>
<p>Generali also created chief operating and chief investment
officer roles, to be held by Greco on an interim basis. Balbinot
will leave the board of directors. </p>
<h2>Business Plan </h2>
<p>Greco said in August he''ll announce the timing of a new
business plan on Nov. 9, when third-quarter results are
published. The insurer is seeking to sell non-strategic assets,
including its U.S. life reinsurance business and Swiss asset-
management unit BSI Group, people familiar with the matter have
said. </p>
<p>Generali''s second-quarter profit climbed 45 percent after
year-earlier writedowns on Greek bonds and other securities
weren''t repeated. In 2011, net income slumped 50 percent to the
lowest level since 2002, and the insurer''s stock sank to an
almost two-decade low on May 31. </p>
<p>Investors are betting Greco, a former McKinsey  Co.
consultant who joined from Zurich Insurance Group AG, can
replicate what he achieved over 17 years in the insurance
industry, when he oversaw businesses in countries including
France, Spain, Turkey and Italy. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) lost a bid
for dismissal of a lawsuit by Australian hedge fund Basis
Capital Funds Management Ltd. over the sale of securities known
as Timberwolf and Point Pleasant. </p>
<p>New York Supreme Court Judge Shirley Werner Kornreich in an
order yesterday denied Goldman Sachs''s request to throw out
Basis Capital''s fraud, negligent misrepresentation, unjust
enrichment and recession claims. The judge agreed to dismiss the
breach of contract claim and a claim for breach of implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing. </p>
<p>The suit, filed a year ago in Manhattan by Basis Capital''s
Basis Yield Alpha Fund, accuses New York-based Goldman Sachs of
knowingly making materially false and misleading statements
and omissions in connection with the securities. </p>
<p>The claims relate to Point Pleasant, a collateralized debt
obligation based on subprime residential home mortgages, and two
credit default swaps that referenced securities from a similar
CDO known as Timberwolf. </p>
<p>Basis Capital accuses Goldman Sachs of marketing new CDO
investments in early 2007, after the company had already
determined that the value of securities in that market would
likely go into sharp decline in the near future, and used the
new CDOs as a vehicle to short the market. </p>
<p>Basis Capital is seeking to recover the $67 million in
compensatory damages and $1 billion in punitive damages,
according to the lawsuit. </p>
<p>Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to
comment on the ruling. </p>
<p>The case is Basis Yield Alpha Fund (Master), 652996/2011,
New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s biggest
drugmaker, agreed to pay as much as $700 million to buy NextWave
Pharmaceuticals Inc., the closely held maker of a medicine to
treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. </p>
<p>The deal includes an initial $255 million and as much as
$425 million in milestone payments depending on how well
NextWave''s liquid ADHD drug, Quillivant XR, sells, New York-
based Pfizer said in a statement today. Pfizer had paid
Cupertino, California-based NextWave $20 million in the second
quarter as part of an option to buy the company. </p>
<p>NextWave''s formulation was approved by U.S. regulators on
Oct. 1. It''s a liquid form of attention-deficit drugs such as
Novartis AG''s Focalin that no longer have patent protection. </p>
<p>This agreement demonstrates our focused expansion of the
Established Products U.S. brands business, Albert Bourla,
president of Pfizer''s Established Products unit, said in the
statement. </p>
<p>Pfizer has been shedding non-drug units like its animal
health and nutritionals businesses as Chief Executive Officer
Ian Read focuses the company on developing new prescription
medicines. The drugmaker''s shares fell less than 1 percent to
$25.60 at the close of New York trading. </p>
<p>Jefferies Group Inc. acted as financial adviser to Pfizer,
while Aquilo Partners LP was NextWave''s adviser, according to
the statement. </p>

<p>Jean Wang, who works in fixed-income
sales for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) in London, told her roommate
in 2009 that buying shares based on tips from a Mizuho
International Plc banker she was in a relationship with was
insider trading. </p>
<p>Wang''s former roommate, Jessica Mang, a British
chiropractor, is on trial accused of making 65,000 pounds
($104,000) trading on illegal tips about Canon Inc. (7751)''s
acquisition of OCE NV in 2009 that she got from her then-
boyfriend, former Mizuho banker Thomas Ammann. </p>
<p>I basically said I don''t think Thomas should be doing
that, that''s insider trading, Wang testified at a London court
today. My impression was it was the deal he was working on and
he was relatively sure it would happen. </p>
<p>Mang is on trial with another of Ammann''s girlfriends,
Christina Weckwerth. The U.K. Financial Services Authority,
which is prosecuting the case, said Weckwerth took in nearly
2 million pounds from her trading on the same deal. Both paid
half the profits they made to Ammann, a lawyer for the FSA said
during the first day of trial last week. </p>
<p>Wang and Mang, who were high school classmates, lived
together in central London from 2007 until April 2010. Wang said
they were friends and she didn''t like Ammann because he didn''t
treat Mang with enough respect, failing to show up for Mang''s
birthday and once keeping her waiting for three hours at a
Haagen Daz ice cream shop. </p>
<h2>Canon Adviser </h2>
<p>Ammann, who worked for the Mizuho mergers and acquisitions
team that advised Canon on the OCE deal, pleaded guilty earlier
this year to insider trading and encouraging both women to
commit insider trading. Canon, the Tokyo-based maker of cameras
and photocopiers, agreed to buy OCE in a 730 million-euro (953
million) deal in November 2009. </p>
<p>Wang said she was surprised to hear Ammann wanted Mang to
make an investment and told her it was insider trading. Wang
said she didn''t explain what insider trading was to her then-
roommate and only mentioned it once -- a mention that was
probably not something she recognizes as significant. </p>
<p>It was more the suggestion that he should know better,
Wang said. I didn''t go further into details with it with
Jess. </p>
<p>Mang bought OCE shares and then sold them five days later
for almost twice what she invested, the FSA said. She wrote in
her diary that Ammann advised her to invest. </p>
<p>The trial is scheduled to last as long as five weeks. </p>

<p>LEG NRW GmbH, the German residential
landlord owned by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s Whitehall Street
Real Estate Funds, is considering an initial public offering as
early as the second quarter of 2013, two people with knowledge
of the plan said. </p>
<p>LEG, based in Dusseldorf, plans to select banks to run the
share sale by the end of the year, said one of the people. Both
of them asked not to be identified because the talks are
private. LEG''s 90,000 apartments are valued at about 4.7 billion
euros ($6.1 billion), according to LEG''s 2011 annual report. The
homes are in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany''s most populous
state. </p>
<p>Manfred Neuhoefer, a spokesman for LEG, and Roland Leithaeuser, a spokesman at Goldman, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which bought LEG from the state government
for about 3.5 billion euros in 2008, is seeking to profit from
the boom in German residential real estate. The FTSE EPRA/Nareit
index of German property stocks has gained 32 percent this year
as investors seek a safe place to put their money amid the
European sovereign-debt crisis. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is one of the most active foreign investors
in German real estate. In 2011, the firm spun off GSW Immobilien
AG (GIB), now Germany''s third-largest residential landlord by market
value, in an IPO that raised about 468 million euros. </p>
<p>Goldman''s Whitehall Street made a failed bid to buy
Baubecon, the residential property portfolio that Barclays Plc (BARC)
agreed to sell to Deutsche Wohnen AG in May in a deal valued at
1.24 billion euros. </p>
<h2>More Liquidity </h2>
<p>An IPO would help make Germany more attractive to real
estate investors by adding liquidity to the market, said Torsten Klingner, an analyst at Warburg Research in Hamburg. </p>
<p>The German residential listed market is too small by
international standards and fairly illiquid, Klingner said. </p>
<p>Deutsche Annington Immobilien GmbH, Germany''s largest owner
of apartments, also plans to sell shares in an IPO next year.
Annington, which has 186,000 apartments, is controlled by Guy Hands'' Terra Firma Capital Partners Ltd. </p>
<p>LEG is preparing to access capital markets and an IPO is
possible, Chief Executive Officer Thomas Hegel said at a press
conference in September. </p>
<p>LEG reported a net loss of 15 million euros for 2011,
compared with a profit of 29 million euros a year earlier, after
spending money to upgrade its technology and refinancing debt,
according to Neuhoefer. The company generated rental income of
244 million euros, up from 241 million euros. Funds from
operations excluding sales of properties, a measure of a
property company''s ability to raise cash, amounted to 112
million euros. </p>

Cohn, 52, made $1.87 million selling 40,425, a separate filing showed. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, has gained in New York Stock Exchange composite trading in the past 10 years, even as the stock is worth about half the price of five years ago. The six executives sold a combined 320,424 shares last week at prices ranging from $123.92 to $126.17 after buying them at the $78.87 strike price granted in November and December 2002, the filings show. </p> <p>Michael S.

In November 2009, Sherwood made about $15.7 million exercising options on 182,860 shares. </p> <p>Chief Financial Officer David A.

<p>The U.S. economy is the strongest
among developed markets as a debt crisis weighs on Europe, said
Joseph Tanious, a global market strategist at JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM)''s asset-management unit. </p>
<p>It''s kind of like the best house in a really lousy
neighborhood, Tanious today said at a presentation in
Washington. The U.S. economy will grow at about a 2 percent pace
for the next two years, he said. </p>
<p>Tanious joins JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon
in highlighting the potential for the U.S. economy while Europe
struggles, even as tax hikes and spending cuts loom as part of
the so-called fiscal cliff. Lawmakers will find a way to avoid
the fiscal cliff after U.S. elections in November, Tanious said. </p>
<p>It is in no political party''s best interest to push the
U.S. economy into a recession, Tanious said at the American
Council of Life Insurers'' annual conference. You''re going to
see a lot of political banter, but at the end of the day I do
think an agreement will be reached. </p>
<p>Dimon hosted a meeting of more than 75 CEOs at his bank''s
New York headquarters yesterday to build support for a campaign
to address the U.S. deficit and avert the fiscal cliff,
according to a person with knowledge of the event. He''s said
bond markets will eventually spurn U.S. debt if lawmakers fail
to reach an agreement to address the deficit. </p>
<p>Still, Dimon has affirmed his faith in the U.S., saying
Oct. 10 that the economy remains fundamentally stronger than
people might think. </p>
<p>The U.S. economy will grow by 2.1 percent this year and 2
percent in 2013, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
The euro zone may shrink this year and grow by 0.3 percent next
year, economists estimate. Better growth prospects have helped
the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index (SPX) of U.S. stocks rally 12 percent
this year, compared with the 9.8 percent gain of the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index. (SXXP) </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, never seriously looked at
selling its commodities unit as lenders consider their options
amid new rules on proprietary trading. </p>
<p>While we constantly evaluate all our businesses, senior
management never seriously looked at spinning out all or part of
our commodity business, Sophie Bullock, a spokeswoman for the
bank in London, said in a statement today. </p>
<p>The Volcker rule may cut profit at the biggest U.S. banks
twice as much as earlier estimates if regulators take a strict
stance on limiting proprietary trading, Standard  Poor''s said
yesterday. Qatar is weighing a potential stake in Morgan
Stanley''s commodities unit, Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin
Jassim Al Thani said last week. </p>
<p>It seems banks are restructuring or in some cases
curtailing their activities in light of the Volcker rule while
others haven''t made any changes, said Robert Finney, a partner
at Holman Fenwick Willan LLP in London who specializes in
financial services and regulation. The extra-territorial
application that would extend the rule to non-U.S. institutions
as well as non-U.S. branches and affiliates of U.S. banks
remains uncertain, as does the interaction with new capital and
liquidity rules under Basel III. Many institutions hope the rule
will be watered down after the U.S. elections. </p>
<h2>Hedging Impaired </h2>
<p>The Volcker rule would impair banks'' ability to provide
commodity-related hedging and financing services as currently
written, Simon Greenshields, co-head of Morgan Stanley''s
commodities, said in a comment letter to regulators in February. </p>
<p>Revenue generated by the 10 largest banks'' commodity units
slumped 20 percent in the first six months this year to $3.5
billion from $4.4 billion a year earlier, according to
Coalition, a London-based research company. Their overall fixed
income revenue dropped 1.1 percent to $51.49 billion, it said. </p>
<p>Goldman''s revenue from fixed-income, currency and commodity
trading climbed 28 percent in the third quarter from a year
earlier to $2.22 billion, it said on Oct. 16. Its value-at-risk,
a measure of the company''s potential daily trading losses, fell
to $81 million, the lowest since the fourth quarter of 2005. </p>
<p>Commodities and currencies were both negatively impacted
by continued low levels of volatility and volumes, Harvey Schwartz, who will become chief financial officer at the end of
January, said on a conference call with analysts that day. </p>
<p>The Standard  Poor''s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities erased
gains for the year today, after climbing the past three years. </p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal today reported that Goldman Sachs
held preliminary talks on splitting off its commodities trading
unit in recent years. </p>

<p>The carbon capture project linked to
Chevron Corp. (CVX)''s Gorgon liquefied natural gas project off the
northwest coast of Australia is on track to begin injections in
2015, Australian energy minister Martin Ferguson said. </p>
<p>The world''s largest carbon capture and sequestration
project is designed to inject 3.5 million tons of carbon dioxide
per year at a depth of about 2,300 meters below Barrow Island
off Western Australia. </p>
<p>Carbon capture and storage remains the only viable method
of using fossil fuels, which are still favored for energy
security and affordability, while reducing global emissions in
the long run, Ferguson said in the text of a speech delivered
in Perth today. </p>
<p>Australia is targeting a reduction in greenhouse gas
emissions of at least five percent below 2000 levels by 2020

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will offer its
Surface tablet in China starting Oct. 26, the initial day of
global sales for the device, as the company uses its first
computer to challenge the dominance of Apple (AAPL) Inc.''s iPad. </p>
<p>There''s no delay for Surface in the China market, Ralph Haupter, Microsoft''s chief executive officer for the region,
told Bloomberg News in Shanghai today. Apple''s newest iPad
wasn''t sold in China until four months after the U.S. </p>
<p>Microsoft is trying to jump-start a moribund personal-
computer market and lay claim to some market share in a tablet
PC category dominated by Apple. Personal computer sales are
forecast to decline this year for the first time since 2001,
according to IHS iSuppli, as some customers spend on tablets
instead, a market where Microsoft currently has zero share.
China is now the world''s biggest PC market. </p>
<p>The Chinese market is obviously, as for the whole IT
industry, very important for Microsoft, Haupter said after the
unveiling of the company''s new Windows 8 software in Shanghai
today. The biggest number of downloads in the Beta site have
been coming from China on Windows 8, so the interest is great. </p>
<p>The Windows 8 operating system is an overhaul of the
product to add touch controls for tablet computers. Besides
touch controls, Windows 8 features a completely overhauled
design that drops the start button introduced in Windows 95 for
a start screen with tiles for each of the user''s applications,
as well as important people. </p>
<p>As in the similar Windows Phone design, the tiles
automatically update as new content, such as an e-mail or change
in the weather, comes in. </p>
<p>Revenue from tablet PCs is expected to grow 26 percent to
$79.4 billion next year, according to market research firm
DisplaySearch. </p>
<p>Apple''s newest iPad, which went on sale in the U.S. in
March, wasn''t sold in China until July 20. Carolyn Wu, a
spokeswoman for Apple, didn''t immediately respond to requests
for comment on Haupter''s remarks. </p>

Trinidad and Tobago, Chevron said today in an e-mailed
statement. </p>
<p>The field off the east coast of Trinidad is operated by BG
Group subsidiaries, Chevron said. Both companies have a 50
percent stake in the project, according to the statement. </p>
<p>First gas from the Starfish field is planned to come on
stream in the fourth quarter of 2014, Chevron said in the
statement. </p>
<p>Natural gas produced at the field will be mixed with output
from the Dolphin project and delivered through existing
pipelines to supply contractual commitments with the National
Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago and Atlantic LNG, said
Chevron. The company, with BG Group, has produced natural gas
from the Dolphin field since 1996, according to the statement. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s decision
to provide information about former employee Greg Smith''s pay
and promotion requests to the media may scare staff at the firm
about the privacy of their own reviews, Smith said. </p>
<p>What are people at Goldman thinking? Are they thinking
Is this going to be leaked out to the public?'' Smith, 33,
said in an interview today with Stephanie Ruhle on Bloomberg
Television''s Market Makers. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, said
Smith was denied a raise and a promotion he sought in the months
before he quit the firm with a New York Times op-ed piece that
criticized how the company treated employees. Documents provided
by the company to Bloomberg News showed one of Smith''s managers
calling him off the charts unrealistic in his demands. </p>
<p>Smith, whose book Why I Left Goldman Sachs: A Wall Street
Story went on sale this week, said the information provided by
the firm about him in a nine-page document withheld positive
reviews he''d received. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs should have released all of my reviews from
my entire career and read them out on air, Smith said. I''m
disappointed that instead of shooting the messenger that Goldman
Sachs doesn''t address the issues. </p>
<p>Performance reviews and comments made in those reviews
are kept in strictest confidence, Andrew Williams, a
spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York, said in an e-mailed
statement. Our people can and do rely on the confidentiality
of that process. </p>
<h2>Changing Room </h2>
<p>The book, which includes a description of Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 57, walking naked through the
company gym''s changing room, undermines Smith''s call for
privacy, Williams added. </p>
<p>It''s hard to imagine that someone who writes a book
describing the company CEO coming out of the shower, calling a
female colleague the Black Widow'' and detailing a close
friend''s bachelor party has much standing on the issue of
privacy, Williams said in the statement. </p>
<p>In the wake of Mr. Smith''s abrupt resignation, we had an
obligation to our employees, shareholders and regulators to
determine whether he had raised issues internally, and the
performance reviews and a wealth of other evidence demonstrated
that he had not, Williams added.This was a unique
situation, and our employees recognize that. </p>

<p>Visa Inc. (V), the world''s largest payments network, appointed former JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) retail- banking head Charles Scharf to succeed Joseph W. Saunders as chief executive officer. </p> <p>Scharf, 47, will take over Nov. 1, Foster City, California- based Visa said today in a statement. Scharf moved from his position atop JPMorgan''s retail-banking division in June 2011, when his duties were reassigned and he was transferred to the private-equity unit as a partner. </p> <p>Scharf is a solid, logical choice, Tien-tsin Huang, a JPMorgan analyst, wrote today in a note to clients. He''s a proven thought leader in the global payments industry and can run a large organization with a focus on technology. Moreover, the selection of a bank executive to run Visa implies the board is sticking to its core in servicing bank clients. </p> <p>Saunders, 66, who has led Visa since its 2008 initial public offering and will remain as executive chairman through March, steered the company through challenges to its business model that included new rules on debit-card fees and processing that helped MasterCard Inc. (MA), the second-largest card network, gain market share. Both companies and banks they serve reached a proposed $6.6 billion settlement with merchants over credit-card transaction fees after seven years of litigation. </p>

<p>The regulator, which has referred the matter to the

Association, or Sapia, the Pretoria-based commission said. </p>
<p>The companies exchanged detailed sales volumes of gasoline,
diesel and other fuels, allowing them to align their

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) was warned by European Union regulators to modify how it presents Internet Explorer in its new Windows 8 operating system to avert another antitrust clash, Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said. </p> <p>Microsoft said it would implement changes to Windows 8 before the new version of its operating system goes on sale in two days. The world''s largest software maker was also sent EU antitrust objections today over its failure to comply with a settlement of an earlier probe requiring it to display a choice of rival web browsers. </p> <p>We have raised issues with Microsoft relating to Windows 8, Almunia told reporters in Brussels today. If a user decides to set a rival browser as a default browser, there should not be an unnecessary warning in Windows or confirmations by the user and the Internet Explorer icon should also be unpinned from the Start screen. We expect Microsoft to address these issues. </p> <p>Microsoft has already been fined 1.68 billion euros ($2.17 billion) in EU antitrust probes, including an 899 million-euro penalty for failing to obey an order to share data with competitors. The Redmond, Washington-based company agreed in 2009 to offer access to rival browsers as a part of a settlement to repair its relationship with the bloc''s regulators. It told regulators last December that it was complying with its commitments. </p> <h2>Browser Choice </h2> <p>Robin Koch, a spokesman for Microsoft in Brussels, said the company was changing some aspects of the way the browser choice screen works on Windows 8 and will have those changes implemented before the product goes on sale on Oct. 26. </p> <p>Almunia said he''d contacted Microsoft about Windows 8 and told management at the highest level possible what are my concerns and what kind of presentation should be avoided if they don''t want to take the risk of new investigations. </p> <p>Today''s statement of objections is a step toward possible fines over Microsoft''s failure to comply with its earlier pledge to display a choice of web browser. The EU can fine companies as much as 10 percent of yearly revenue if they breached commitments made legally binding, according to its statement. </p> <p>Microsoft takes the statement of objections listing the EU''s antitrust concerns over compliance with the settlement very seriously, Koch said. </p> <h2>Technical Error </h2> <p>Almunia said in July that Microsoft may have misled regulators by failing to display a browser choice screen to users of the Windows operating system since February 2011. The company blamed a technical error for not showing the screen to some users and offered to extend until March 2016 a commitment to show it. </p> <p>Microsoft is strengthening its internal procedures to help prevent a repeat of the technical error, Koch said. The company will continue to cooperate fully with the commission. </p> <p>The company said in July it only learned that month that it didn''t offer its browser choice software to some 28 million computers running Windows 7 Service Pack 1, or 10 percent of the computers that should have received it. It distributed a software fix to computers that were affected. </p> <p>Under the terms of Microsoft''s 2009 pledge, consumers who buy personal computers were given a choice of the 12 most widely used browsers to install in addition to, or instead of, Microsoft''s Internet Explorer. </p> <h2>Repeat Offenses </h2> <p>Any fines for Microsoft may take into account repeat offenses, Almunia said in July in a reference to the EU''s 2008 penalty for the company''s failure to obey an earlier EU decision. That ruling also ordered it to provide information to software developers to make compatible products. </p> <p>Almunia said there were no grounds for EU officials to intervene on Microsoft''s Windows RT software for tablets. The software, to be introduced on Oct. 26, prohibits any browser except for Internet Explorer, according to a May blog post by Mozilla Corp., maker of the rival Firefox browser. </p> <p>Companies have raised various issues about other aspects of Microsoft''s compliance that regulators had examined and didn''t see any reason to pursue, Almunia said. </p> <p>We will remain vigilant and we will continue to monitor all aspects of Microsoft''s compliance with the commitments in the future, Almunia said. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Simon Kennedy" date="Oct 24, 2012  1:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-24/goldman-s-pill-says-guerrilla-ecb-to-impose-losses-on-skeptics.html"><headline>Goldman''s Pill Says Guerrilla'' ECB to Impose Losses on Skeptics</headline><body><![CDATA[

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer says Windows 8, the next version of his company''s operating system, will be bigger than Windows 95, an early and much heralded upgrade unveiled almost two decades ago. </p> <p>It had better be. </p> <p>Bill Gates, then CEO of the largest software maker, introduced Windows 95 when the World Wide Web was still coming of age. While the program met with robust demand, it failed to catapult Microsoft to the forefront of the Internet industry. </p> <p>On the eve of Windows 8''s release, Microsoft is facing the risk of being left behind again by another technological wave -- the rise of mobile computing in the form of tablets and smartphones, led by Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s iPhone and iPad. To respond, the company has completely redesigned the software to include touch-screen capabilities. To showcase the new operating system, Microsoft has also broken with tradition by making its own tablet, becoming a competitor to longstanding hardware partners. </p> <p>It''s starting to look like the biggest thing that Microsoft has ever done is going to be getting past the next few weeks, said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Gartner Inc. who has covered the company since the release of Windows 95. They have to match what it took competitors 10 years to do -- oh, and they have to bring partners along with them. </p> <h2>PC Slump </h2> <p>Windows 8, which will power desktops, laptops and handheld tablets, and the company''s new device, called Surface, will go on sale Oct. 26 following a kickoff event in New York tomorrow. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft is relying on the software, a product conceived in 2009, to revive interest in the personal computer. The PC market will contract by 1.2 percent to 348.7 million units this year, according to IHS ISuppli. That would be the first annual decline since 2001. </p> <p>Yet the software may not be able to outweigh consumers'' growing attraction to tablets and smartphones, which are getting faster and more powerful and doing more tasks people once needed PCs for. IDC, another researcher, is likely to cut its projection for fourth-quarter PC shipment growth, which had been estimated at 4.8 percent, analyst Loren Loverde said. Even that gain would have represented limited growth for a quarter in which a major new Windows program goes on sale, he said. It''s also slower than historical growth rates that averaged more than 10 percent a quarter from 2003 through 2010. </p> <p>Casting a further shadow over the introduction, Intel Corp. (INTC) CEO Paul Otellini told staffers in Taiwan last month that Windows 8 is being released before it''s fully ready, a person who attended the event said. Otellini told employees that releasing the operating system on schedule was the right move, and said Microsoft can make improvements after it ships, the person said. </p> <h2>Mobile Moves </h2> <p>While it''s betting on a comeback in PC-market growth, Microsoft is also counting on Surface to make a mark in mobile computing. The product will thrust the company into a hardware market it has left to partners since Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded the company in 1975. In addition, Microsoft will unveil a new version of its Windows Phone software next week. </p> <p>The last three and a half years has been in some ways the most pivotal set of products that we have ever designed and launched, said Jensen Harris, director of program management for Windows user experience. We wanted to shake people loose, to be free to think about what would we do if we didn''t feel constrained by the past. Taking that leap forward meant taking a risk. </p> <p>Ballmer brought Steven Sinofsky, a veteran of Microsoft''s Office software, into the Windows business to stabilize the flagship product ahead of the much-delayed release of Windows Vista, which shipped more than two years late in 2007 and was met with little customer enthusiasm. In 2009, Windows 7 brought the business back on course in part by appealing to corporate customers. </p> <h2>Tablet Threat </h2> <p>Still, Windows 7 hasn''t kept consumers from shifting some computer purchases to tablets like Apple''s iPad. Windows revenue has missed analysts'' estimates in six of the past eight quarters. The company knew it needed to do something drastic to show Windows could go mobile. </p> <p>We started thinking about if we were to start Windows today, if we were starting fresh, what would it look like? said Julie Larson-Green, the vice president who oversaw the design and delivery of Windows 8. </p> <p>Larson-Green''s team got rid of Windows 95''s iconic multicolored Start button, even though some product testers complained. The new Windows'' home screen adopts the tile-like interface now used in Windows Phone, which can be personalized and automatically updates with weather or messages from friends and family. </p> <p>In another departure for Microsoft, computers with chips based on ARM Holdings Plc (ARM)''s technology will be able to run a version of the new software called Windows RT. </p> <h2>Strong Opinions'' </h2> <p>Some people are going to see it and they''re going to have strong opinions that are going to be negative, and some people are going to love it in a way that they''ve never loved Windows before, Harris said. </p> <p>Still, Larson-Green said she''s never been concerned that the design and direction would be poorly received. By the time she and Sinofsky first unveiled it in June 2011, the team had done enough research to feel confident but not cavalier, she said. </p> <p>One thing Microsoft has sought to replicate from Apple is the company''s famous attention to detail, Harris said. For Windows 8, that meant a lot of time spent perfecting things that previously might have been declared good enough. </p> <h2>Five Buttons </h2> <p>Swiping from the right edge of the screen brings up five buttons Microsoft calls charms. The Windows logo button exhibits a subtle animation that looks almost as if light is coming across it, Harris said. To get it right, a team of six or seven people spent an entire weekend holed up in an office in Microsoft''s building 84. Every hour, they looked at 30 to 40 different versions until it was perfect. </p> <p>That level of detail has not existed in this product in that way before, he said. </p> <p>The emphasis on tablets and on touch controls, which IDC estimates will only be available in 15 percent of notebook PCs next year, has some analysts concerned that the operating system is too consumer-focused. </p> <p>As far as enterprise is concerned, Windows 8 is Windows Vista version 2 -- it''s the version they skip, said Bob O''Donnell, an analyst at IDC. </p> <h2>Business Customization </h2> <p>Larson-Green disagrees. She said the customizable nature of Windows 8''s start screen means businesses can tweak versions to show exactly what their employees require and to display the latest information in the automatically updating tiles. </p> <p>With corporate use of the iPad rising, Apple is no longer just a consumer threat. Currently there''s no version of Microsoft''s Office productivity software for the iPad, which means the success of those devices with businesses also may imperil growth in Microsoft''s biggest division. </p> <p>Office and Windows are bosom buddies, said Wes Miller, an analyst at Directions on Microsoft in Kirkland, Washington. As Office goes, so goes Windows, and vice versa. </p> <p>If Microsoft''s strategy fails, it won''t be for lack of guts, said IDC''s O''Donnell. </p> <p>It''s incredibly bold, it''s incredibly hard to do, he said. I''m not convinced it''s all going to work out exactly as they hoped. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Nick Turner" date="Oct 25, 2012  7:35 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-25/ibm-received-request-from-sec-over-dealings-with-iran-zte-1-.html"><headline>IBM Received Request From SEC Over Dealings With Iran, ZTE</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) received a request from the Securities and Exchange
Commission to describe its interactions with Iran, following
reports that ZTE Corp. (000063) resold some IBM products in the country. </p>
<p>IBM supplied information to the SEC, which completed its
investigation in September, according to documents released
today. As IBM''s business partner, ZTE is required to comply
fully with U.S. regulations, including economic sanctions and
export laws, IBM said in its response to the SEC. </p>
<p>Iran is designated as a state sponsor of terrorism by the
State Department and is subject to U.S. economic sanctions and
export controls, the SEC said in an August letter to IBM.
Please describe to us the nature, duration, and extent of your
past, current, and anticipated contacts with Iran, whether
through subsidiaries, distributors, resellers, or other direct
or indirect arrangements. </p>
<p>The SEC also requested information about IBM''s contacts
with Syria, Sudan and Cuba. IBM responded on Sept. 10, saying it
complies with all U.S. economic sanctions and export laws and
regulations, including those regarding countries identified as
state sponsors of terrorism. In a follow-up letter to IBM on
Sept. 25, the SEC said it had completed its review. </p>
<h2>Great Seriousness'' </h2>
<p>IBM takes its obligations regarding export compliance
with great seriousness, Doug Shelton, a spokesman for Armonk,
New York-based IBM, said in an e-mail. Our agreements with our
business partners specifically prohibit them from the transfer
of IBM products to Iran. If any of IBM''s business partners are
breaching our export compliance agreements, IBM will take
appropriate actions. </p>
<p>Margrete Ma, a spokeswoman for Shenzhen, China-based ZTE,
didn''t reply to an e-mail sent after business hours local time. </p>
<p>In June, U.S. lawmakers asked ZTE and another Chinese
telecommunications company, Huawei Technologies Co., for details
about their business dealings as part of an investigation into
how their expansion may affect U.S. security. In the letter,
they questioned whether ZTE sold highly sophisticated
surveillance technology to the Iranian government. </p>
<p>The House Intelligence Committee began an investigation
last year to review the threat posed to U.S. national security
interests by telecommunications companies with potential ties to
the Chinese government, according to a committee statement. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) introduced the biggest overhaul of its flagship Windows software in two decades, reflecting the rising stakes in its competition with Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG) for the loyalty of customers who are shunning personal computers and flocking to mobile devices. </p> <p>This is the biggest product we''ve ever done, Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said today in an interview with Bloomberg Television, comparing it with the arrival of the PC in 1981 and the introduction of Windows 95. </p> <p>Microsoft packed the new Windows with touch-screen capabilities, designed to vault the company into the tablet market dominated by Apple''s iPad. To avoid being left behind as computing increasingly shifts to mobile devices like tablets and smartphones, the company radically altered Windows'' familiar design and scrapped a strategy that had it relying entirely on partners to produce Windows computers. </p> <p>In creating Windows 8, we shunned the incremental, Windows President Steven Sinofsky said at an event to mark the product''s release today at New York''s Pier 57. Windows 8 and the company''s first-ever computer, the Surface tablet, go on sale tomorrow. </p> <p>Microsoft shares slipped less than 1 percent to $27.88 at the close in New York. The stock has gained 7.4 percent this year. </p> <h2>1,000 Computers </h2> <p>More than 1,000 computers have been certified for Windows 8, Sinofsky said. That will include the first Windows machines capable of running on chips with technology from ARM Holdings Plc (ARM), instead of Intel (INTC) Corp. Besides Microsoft''s own Surface, the list of ARM-powered machines includes computers from Dell Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Lenovo Group Ltd. and Asustek Computer Inc. These run a version called Windows RT. </p> <p>Still, Surface and the other Windows RT machines will be constrained in competition with Apple because they don''t work with some of the most widely used downloadable applications. The RT-based machines can only run apps from Microsoft''s new Windows store, which won''t feature applications for Facebook Inc. (FB)''s social-networking service or Apple''s iTunes music store. </p> <p>The Windows store does have some popular apps, including those from media-streaming companies Hulu LLC and Netflix Inc. (NFLX) Still, Microsoft won''t say how many apps are available for the operating system, and the lack of a broad range of games, tools and other downloadable software will detract from the Surface in a head-to-head comparison against the iPad and its more than 275,000 apps. </p> <h2>Promissory Note'' </h2> <p>Part of me had hoped that we''d see more killer apps, said Wes Miller, an analyst at Directions on Microsoft in Kirkland, Washington. Consumers who buy into the platform on Friday -- unless we start seeing an abundance of apps -- are buying into a promissory note that the apps will arrive. </p> <p>Machines with Windows 8 that run chips from Intel can run older Windows programs. </p> <p>Downloadable applications have become central to the way customers use tablet computers, and one of Apple''s selling points is its leadership in apps. The company introduced a smaller, lower-cost version of the iPad earlier this week, part of CEO Tim Cook''s effort to keep budget-conscious shoppers from turning to inexpensive tablets sold by competitors such as Amazon.com Inc. The iPad mini is available for early orders tomorrow, the same day Surface hits stores. </p> <h2>Consumer Defection </h2> <p>The PC market will contract by 1.2 percent to 348.7 million units this year, according to IHS ISuppli. That would be the first annual decline since 2001. Microsoft is relying on the new operating system to revive interest in the PC and carve out a position for Windows in the tablet market, which is picking up consumers defecting from PCs. </p> <p>Microsoft has had a lot of interest in writing applications for the operating system and has had to add staff and computers to process and approve the submissions, Antoine Leblond, the vice president in charge of the Windows app store, said in an interview. </p> <p>Because apps written for the program can be sold not just to tablet users but to hundreds of millions of customers who will get Windows 8 on PCs, Microsoft has a chance to win over more developers, Leblond said. </p> <p>Microsoft feels pretty strongly that the platform they have built is compelling to both users and developers, Directions on Microsoft''s Miller said. Time will tell if both are true. </p> <p>Miller''s own examination of the Windows app store indicates there were 7,873 apps worldwide earlier this week, with hundreds being added daily. </p> <h2>Facebook Decision </h2> <p>Still, Facebook, for example, only writes apps for Apple''s iOS and Google''s Android operating system, and the company opted not to do Windows, a person familiar with the matter said in May. Microsoft could have written a Facebook app on its own using Facebook''s open standards, which is what the Windows Phone group did when similarly faced with a possible dearth of apps in 2010. </p> <p>Facebook will or will not decide to write an app, Leblond said. That''s their decision to make. We''re not going to build a native app for them. </p> <p>Leblond also notes that Windows RT customers can go to Facebook''s website through their browser and get a similar experience to the app. </p> <p>Instead, the Windows group focused their budget on workshops to train developers and resources to help them write apps, Leblond said. More than 400,000 people have attended developer camps run by the company, he said. </p> <p>Besides Hulu and Netflix, the new Windows will also have apps such as the Skype Internet-calling service and Evernote Corp.''s note-taking tool. A version of Rovio Entertainment Oy''s Angry Birds game will be available Nov. 8. </p> <p>When the store opens, we will have more apps in it than any other store when it opened, and to me that''s a great sign of momentum, Leblond said. I''m much more interested in the momentum that we''re seeing than what that absolute count looks like. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Bloomberg News" date="Oct 25, 2012  1:20 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-25/microsoft-s-china-first-tablet-sales-challenge-apple.html"><headline>Microsoft''s China-First Tablet Sales Challenge Apple</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) sold its first Surface tablet at a department store in northwest Beijing as the company seeks to challenge Apple Inc. (AAPL), which had offered the last iPad in China months after its U.S. debut. </p> <p>This is the first place in the world where people will be able to get Surface devices in their hands, Ralph Haupter, Microsoft''s chief executive officer for China, said in an interview today at the Suning Appliance Co. (002024) store in Beijing. Having it here in China is addressing the capability of the China market, the fact that we produce these devices here and can bring it to a big, big addressable consumer market. </p> <p>Consumers in China, the world''s largest personal computer market, typically must wait months to get the latest Apple devices. The third generation of Apple''s iPad, which went on sale in the U.S. in March, wasn''t sold in China until four months later. Still, a commitment to earlier China sales alone won''t be enough for Microsoft to unseat Apple, said Shaw Wu, an analyst at Sterne Agee  Leach Inc. </p> <p>I would agree that launching in China makes sense but Apple is already there with the third-generation iPad, Wu said in an Oct. 24 e-mail. At the end of the day, the product has to appeal with its usability and ecosystem and it isn''t clear that Microsoft can deliver. </p> <p>Suning will sell the devices at 500 locations across China, Haupter said, declining to comment on sales or market share forecasts for the device in China. </p> <p>We all recognize China is a great market to have devices, Haupter said. The pure number of people using devices in China is giving us a huge opportunity. </p> <h2>Chinese Cities </h2> <p>In addition to the nation''s capital, Microsoft is holding similar events in four other Chinese cities: Shanghai, Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Nanjing, Haupter said. Sales will follow today in the U.S. and markets including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, and the United Kingdom. </p> <p>More than 600 people lined up outside the Beijing location to collect a number needed to buy the device at the midnight debut, said Xu Lei, a Suning spokesman. </p> <p>The first person in line was Chen Shi, a 25-year-old electrician from Beijing, who said he camped out from 6 p.m. the night before to be first in line. He said Microsoft''s decision to debut the Surface first in China was very important. </p> <p>This shows the proper respect for the China market, which Apple doesn''t always do, Chen said. China is a great consumer market and that needs to be recognized. </p> <p>Second in line was Zhou Qiaochuan, a 26-year-old publisher, who said he arrived at 9 a.m. He said he''s very excited as a long-time Windows user who also owns an iPhone and has been frustrated by Apple''s delayed introduction in China. </p> <h2>Really Angry'' </h2> <p>Why do you make us wait so long, he said. It makes me really angry. China is such an important consumer market and Apple doesn''t recognize it. That''s laughable. Microsoft is doing it right. </p> <p>While Apple''s products are sold later in China than the U.S., many Chinese still get them when they travel abroad, Wu said. </p> <p>Consumers in China who can''t travel to get Apple''s products before the local release are forced to pay a markup to smugglers who bring the devices from Hong Kong, said Bryan Ma, a Singapore-based analyst at research firm IDC. Microsoft could win over some buyers by providing an escape from that routine, he said. </p> <p>For most Apple products, people have to pay a premium to get products on the gray market in the months it takes Apple to launch officially in China, Ma said. Microsoft putting China first in the priority list could help to make buyers feel special. </p> <h2>Global Dominance </h2> <p>Still, that won''t translate into unseating Apple from its global dominance, Ma said. IDC forecasts Apple''s share of the tablet market will rise to 61 percent next year, from 60 percent this year. The share for all tablets running Windows software will rise to 6 percent next year, from 4 percent this year, Ma said. Google Inc. (GOOG)''s Android system will drop to 33 percent next year, from 35 percent this year. </p> <p>Apple''s Beijing-based spokeswoman Carolyn Wu declined to comment on Microsoft''s tablet strategy, or how it would affect iPad sales in China. </p> <p>Tablets and mobile devices running the new Windows 8 system are key for Microsoft, as personal computer sales are forecast to decline this year for the first time since 2001, according to IHS iSuppli. </p> <p>The Windows 8 operating system is an overhaul of the product to add touch controls for tablet computers. Windows 8 also features a new design that drops the start button introduced in Windows 95, replacing it with tiles for each of the user''s applications, as well as ones displaying snippets of information such as weather, news and people. </p> <h2>Tablet Revenue </h2> <p>As in the similar Windows Phone design, the tiles automatically update as new content, such as an e-mail or change in the weather, comes in. </p> <p>Revenue from tablet PCs is expected to grow 26 percent to $79.4 billion next year, according to market research firm NPD DisplaySearch. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Dina Bass" date="Oct 25, 2012 12:54 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-25/microsoft-unveils-windows-8-as-stakes-rise-in-apple-fight.html"><headline>Microsoft Unveils Windows 8 as Stakes Rise in Apple Fight</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) introduced the biggest overhaul of its flagship Windows software in two decades, reflecting the rising stakes in its competition with Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. for the loyalty of customers who are shunning personal computers and flocking to mobile devices. </p> <p>This is the biggest product we''ve ever done, Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said today in an interview with Bloomberg Television, comparing it with the arrival of the PC in 1981 and the introduction of Windows 95. </p> <p>Microsoft packed the new Windows with touch-screen capabilities, designed to vault the company into the tablet market dominated by Apple''s iPad. To avoid being left behind as computing increasingly shifts to mobile devices like tablets and smartphones, the company radically altered Windows'' familiar design and scrapped a strategy that had it relying entirely on partners to produce Windows computers. </p> <p>In creating Windows 8, we shunned the incremental, Windows President Steven Sinofsky said at an event to mark the product''s release today at New York''s Pier 57. Windows 8 and the company''s first-ever computer, the Surface tablet, go on sale tomorrow. </p> <p>Microsoft shares were little changed at $27.90 at 12:51 p.m. in New York. Through yesterday, the shares had gained 7.5 percent this year. </p> <h2>1,000 Computers </h2> <p>More than 1,000 computers have been certified for Windows 8, Sinofsky said. That will include the first Windows machines capable of running on chips with technology from ARM Holdings Plc (ARM), instead of Intel Corp. Besides Microsoft''s own Surface, the list of ARM-powered machines includes computers from Dell Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Lenovo Group Ltd. and Asustek Computer Inc. These run a version called Windows RT. </p> <p>Still, Surface and the other Windows RT machines will be constrained in competition with Apple because they don''t work with some of the most widely used downloadable applications. The RT-based machines can only run apps from Microsoft''s new Windows store, which won''t feature applications for Facebook Inc. (FB)''s social-networking service or Apple''s iTunes music store. </p> <p>The Windows store does have some popular apps, including those from media-streaming companies Hulu LLC and Netflix Inc. (NFLX) Still, Microsoft won''t say how many apps are available for the operating system, and the lack of a broad range of games, tools and other downloadable software will detract from the Surface in a head-to-head comparison against the iPad and its more than 275,000 apps. </p> <h2>Promissory Note'' </h2> <p>Part of me had hoped that we''d see more killer apps, said Wes Miller, an analyst at Directions on Microsoft in Kirkland, Washington. Consumers who buy into the platform on Friday -- unless we start seeing an abundance of apps -- are buying into a promissory note that the apps will arrive. </p> <p>Machines with Windows 8 that run chips from Intel can run older Windows programs. </p> <p>Downloadable applications have become central to the way customers use tablet computers, and one of Apple''s selling points is its leadership in apps. The company introduced a smaller, lower-cost version of the iPad earlier this week, part of CEO Tim Cook''s effort to keep budget-conscious shoppers from turning to inexpensive tablets sold by competitors such as Amazon.com Inc. The iPad mini is available for early orders tomorrow, the same day Surface hits stores. </p> <h2>Consumer Defection </h2> <p>The PC market will contract by 1.2 percent to 348.7 million units this year, according to IHS ISuppli. That would be the first annual decline since 2001. Microsoft is relying on the new operating system to revive interest in the PC and carve out a position for Windows in the tablet market, which is picking up consumers defecting from PCs. </p> <p>Microsoft has had a lot of interest in writing applications for the operating system and has had to add staff and computers to process and approve the submissions, Antoine Leblond, the vice president in charge of the Windows app store, said in an interview. </p> <p>Because apps written for the program can be sold not just to tablet users but to hundreds of millions of customers who will get Windows 8 on PCs, Microsoft has a chance to win over more developers, Leblond said. </p> <p>Microsoft feels pretty strongly that the platform they have built is compelling to both users and developers, Directions on Microsoft''s Miller said. Time will tell if both are true. </p> <p>Miller''s own examination of the Windows app store indicates there were 7,873 apps worldwide earlier this week, with hundreds being added daily. </p> <h2>Facebook Decision </h2> <p>Still, Facebook, for example, only writes apps for Apple''s iOS and Google''s Android operating system, and the company opted not to do Windows, a person familiar with the matter said in May. Microsoft could have written a Facebook app on its own using Facebook''s open standards, which is what the Windows Phone group did when similarly faced with a possible dearth of apps in 2010. </p> <p>Facebook will or will not decide to write an app, Leblond said. That''s their decision to make. We''re not going to build a native app for them. </p> <p>Leblond also notes that Windows RT customers can go to Facebook''s website through their browser and get a similar experience to the app. </p> <p>Instead, the Windows group focused their budget on workshops to train developers and resources to help them write apps, Leblond said.

since 2011. </p>
<p>Sistema, billionaire Vladimir Evtushenkov''s company that
also controls MTS, would reduce its stake in MTS-Bank to 65
percent under the deal, according to a separate statement from
the mobile operator. </p>

<p>Financial firms including Bank of
Montreal and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) risk losing as much as
$190 million in advisory fees if the Canadian government rejects
C$23 billion ($23.2 billion) of planned takeovers. </p>
<p>Canada turned down a C$5.2 billion bid by Malaysia''s state-
owned oil company for Calgary-based Progress Energy Resources
Corp. (PRQ) on Oct. 19, raising concern that a $15.1 billion bid for
Nexen Inc. (NXY) by Cnooc Ltd. (883) of China may face the same fate. BCE
Inc. (BCE)''s C$3 billion takeover of Astral Media Inc. (ACM/A) was rejected by
Canada''s broadcast regulator a day earlier. </p>
<p>Investment bankers on both sides of the three deals stand
to make as much as $190 million in advisory fees, according to
estimates by New York-based Freeman  Co., which specializes in
mergers consulting in the financial industry. Freeman uses its
own model to estimate bank fees based on deal size, industry and
nature of the transaction. </p>
<p>In the case that the deals fail, adviser banks may get
paid a small percentage, depending on negotiation, of the total
fees, Lam Nguyen, a director at Freeman, said yesterday. In
addition, banks advising the target side may split a percentage,
depending on negotiation, of the breakup fees if there are
breakup fees. </p>
<p>Progress Energy and Kuala Lumpur-based Petroliam Nasional
Bhd., or Petronas, have been speaking with government officials
in Ottawa this week on how to resolve the impasse. The
government ruled the Petronas purchase doesn''t provide a net
benefit to Canada. </p>
<h2>Progress Costs </h2>
<p>Progress said estimated fees and costs from its takeover
are not expected to exceed C$22.7 million, according to
regulatory filings. The amount includes  employee
obligations, fees to Bank of Montreal (BMO)''s BMO Capital Markets as
its financial adviser and Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) for a fairness
opinion, as well as legal fees and other costs, according to the
July 20 filing. </p>
<p>Paul Deegan, a spokesman for Toronto-based Bank of
Montreal, declined to comment. Scotiabank spokesman Joe Konecny
didn''t immediately provide a comment. </p>
<p>The potential combined advisory fees for both sides on the
Progress-Petronas deal are estimated at $40 million to $50
million, Freeman''s Nguyen said. </p>
<p>Transaction costs for Petronas, which is being advised by
Bank of America''s Merrill Lynch unit, haven''t been disclosed.
Kerrie McHugh, a bank spokeswoman, declined to comment. </p>
<h2>Success Loaded'' </h2>
<p>Investment bankers have the most to lose if deals fail,
said Frank Turner, co-chairman of the corporate group at Osler,
Hoskin  Harcourt LLP law firm. </p>
<p>They''re the ones whose compensation is typically most
tied to a successful outcome, Turner said in a phone interview
from Calgary yesterday. For the financial advisers on the sell
side, the banking fee is usually success loaded. </p>
<p>BCE, Canada''s largest telecommunications company, agreed in
March to buy Montreal-based specialty broadcaster Astral to
bolster its French-language programming. The deal was rejected
Oct. 18 by the Canadian Radio-television Telecommunications
Commission, which said it would have given Montreal-based BCE
too much control. While BCE has asked the federal government to
intervene to overturn the regulator''s ruling, it will have to
pay Astral a C$150 million break fee if the deal fails. </p>
<p>That''s creating huge uncertainty for bankers, lawyers and
anyone else doing deals in Canada, said Mirko Bibic, BCE''s chief
legal officer. </p>
<h2>Investment Climate'' </h2>
<p>I think people are going to be asking themselves what is
the investment climate today and what is it going to be tomorrow
if the markets and investors don''t have the clarity around what
rules exist and if there''s going to be any consistency in their
application, Bibic said in an Oct. 22 phone interview.
That''s a fundamental issue that we really need to look at
carefully. </p>
<p>Astral said transaction costs were estimated at C$14.7
million, including C$7.1 million in fees to financial advisers.
Royal Bank of Canada (RY) and Montreal-based National Bank of Canada (NA)
advised Astral. </p>
<p>Bank of Montreal and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce
advised BCE. CIBC spokesman Tom Wallis and National Bank
spokeswoman Joan Beauchamp declined to comment. Mark Langton, a
BCE spokesman, declined to say how much BCE''s advisers stand to
lose from a failed deal. </p>
<p>Freeman''s Nguyen estimates potential total advisory fees
for both sides on the Astral-BCE takeover are $30 million to $40
million. </p>
<h2>Work Fees </h2>
<p>Bankers will not entirely lose out if a deal fails.
There''s usually a work fee, but the majority of the fee is on
a contingent basis on the success or completion of the deal,
Eric Castonguay, a managing director at PwC in Toronto, said in
a phone interview yesterday. </p>
<p>Work fees are usually non-refundable and are typically
fixed monthly to help cover costs for banks working on the
transaction, Castonguay said. Bankers may also get part of any
break fees if a deal doesn''t go through, he said. </p>
<p>Cnooc''s takeover of Nexen also faces a government review
under the Investment Canada Act. The act requires the government
to consider foreign takeovers valued at more than C$330 million
to determine whether they are in the country''s interest and
provide a net benefit to Canada. </p>
<h2>Nexen Costs </h2>
<p>Nexen estimates fees, costs and expenses tied to the Cnooc
takeover to be about C$81.7 million. That includes fees to its
financial advisers, New York-based Goldman Sachs, and Royal
Bank, the country''s biggest bank. Royal Bank spokeswoman Gillian McArdle and Michael DuVally, a spokesman at Goldman Sachs,
declined to comment. </p>
<p>The potential advisory fees for both sides in the Nexen-
Cnooc deal are estimated at $80 million to $100 million, Nguyen
said. </p>
<p>Cnooc, which is being advised by Bank of Montreal and
Citigroup Inc., said yesterday it''s assuming the Nexen purchase
will get approved. The Chinese oil explorer expects the deal to
be done by year-end and is prepared for all possible outcomes,
Chief Financial Officer Zhong Hua said in a conference call. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Co. SA (EEEK)''s
decision to leave its home equity market in Athens for London
increases the chance that Greece will be demoted to an emerging
market next year, MSCI Inc. (MSCI) said. </p>
<p>The index provider put Greece''s stock market under review
for downgrade from developed status on June 20 and will make a
final decision as part of its annual reclassification in June
next year. The MSCI Greece Index (MXGR) consists of just two companies,
with the world''s second-largest Coca-Cola bottler accounting for
75 percent by weight. </p>
<p>Market size is the main driver for us to make that
proposal, but on top of that, one needs to admit that there are
still some operational issues that have been present since the
inclusion of MSCI Greece in developed markets back in 2001,
Sebastian Lieblich, global head of index management at MSCI in
Geneva, said in a phone interview yesterday. Coca-Cola''s exit is
a very important development, and this is something we''d need
to assess how investors see this move. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola HBC''s departure will shave off about two-thirds
of the increase in Greece''s market size since the end of June.
The country''s largest company by market value is fleeing the
epicenter of the euro-area sovereign-debt crisis, saying it
wants a more stable economic and regulatory environment. The
company will be based in Switzerland and will trade on the
London Stock Exchange. </p>
<p>Lieblich said that MSCI''s decisions are based on
consultations with investors. </p>
<h2>Exceptional Decision </h2>
<p>MSCI said it won''t discontinue the Greece index after Coca-
Cola HBC''s exit. Any deletions from the gauge will be
substituted by the largest constituents of the MSCI Greece Small
Cap Index (MXGRSC), it said. There are currently 22 members in the small-
cap measure, led by National Bank of Greece SA. (ETE) </p>
<p>MSCI will exceptionally maintain at all times at least
two constituents in the MSCI Greece Index until further
communication, it said in a statement yesterday. Opap SA (OPAP),
Europe''s biggest listed gambling company, is the second stock in
the MSCI Greece, accounting for 25 percent of the gauge''s
weight. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Hellenic makes up 21 percent of the benchmark
Athens Stock Exchange Index (ASE), followed by National Bank, Hellenic
Petroleum SA (ELPE), Hellenic Telecommunications Organization SA and
OPAP, with weights ranging from 8 percent to 5.6 percent. </p>
<h2>Shrinking Market </h2>
<p>The Greek market has lost about 85 percent of its value
since peaking at $273 billion in November 2007 as surging
borrowing costs forced the government to accept two European
Union-led bailouts. </p>
<p>The market value of the MSCI Greece has risen to 7.9
billion euros ($10.2 billion) from 6.7 billion euros at the end
of June, on optimism the nation will agree on a new financing
package with the International Monetary Fund and European
partners. The equity value is still down from 25.8 billion euros
in June 2011. </p>
<p>The overall Greek equity market has climbed to 32.2 billion
euros from 23.5 billion euros at the end of June this year. It
would fall to about 26.1 billion euros once Coca-Cola Hellenic
is removed. </p>
<p>MSCI said in June that restrictions on in-kind transfers,
off-exchange transactions, stock lending and short-selling
impeded Greece from having a fully functional trading place
aligned with those of developed markets. The Greek authorities
had not been receptive to repeated complaints from the
international investment community, the company said. </p>
<p>If at one point in time any market doesn''t provide enough
stocks to clearly represent the investment-opportunity set, then
we may be forced to consider it for demotion, said Lieblich.
The current sovereign-debt issues that Greece is facing are
not at all the trigger point for the reclassification of Greece.
It is really the size combined with the operational issues which
haven''t been solved over the past ten years which we see as a
major concern. </p>

<p>With Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) poised to
lose its lead as the largest publicly traded oil producer by
output, acquiring Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC) or EOG Resources Inc. (EOG)
would accelerate growth and help the company regain its lead. </p>
<p>OAO Rosneft (ROSN)''s plan this week to buy BP Plc (BP/)''s Russian
venture TNK-BP for $55 billion would vault the Moscow-based
company past Exxon in terms of production. Irving, Texas-based
Exxon also is lagging behind on growth, with analysts estimating
only a 3 percent increase in sales through 2014, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with 28 percent at
Rosneft and more than 26 percent at Anadarko and EOG, which have
market values exceeding $30 billion. </p>
<p>As Exxon falls behind in discovering untapped oil fields,
it may be forced to buy what it cannot find, Brown Advisory Inc.
said. For Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG), Anadarko is a candidate for
Exxon because utilities from Singapore to Seoul would pay a
premium to import gas it finds off Mozambique''s coast. EOG would
rejuvenate Exxon with its oil-rich reservoirs in the Eagle Ford
Shale in Texas, U.S. Capital Advisors LLC said. </p>
<p>Exxon is grasping for investment opportunities that carry
scale, Eric Gordon, a Baltimore-based analyst at Brown
Advisory, which oversees $32 billion, said in a telephone
interview. The places where oil is domiciled are becoming more
challenging to get access to, he said. Exxon is being forced
to gain access through acquisitions. </p>
<h2>BP, Billionaires </h2>
<p>Alan Jeffers, an Exxon spokesman, declined to comment on
whether the company is considering an acquisition in response to
Rosneft''s expansion. John Christiansen, a spokesman at The
Woodlands, Texas-based Anadarko, and K Leonard, a spokeswoman at
EOG in Houston, said the companies don''t comment on speculation,
when asked whether Exxon has approached them. </p>
<p>Rosneft, a state-owned energy producer, said Oct. 22 that
it agreed to buy TNK-BP, a 50-50 venture between BP and a group
of billionaires. It will pay $26.8 billion in cash and shares
for BP''s stake and has an initial deal to acquire the
billionaires'' half for $28 billion. </p>
<p>The deal will give Rosneft control of more than 40 percent
of Russia''s crude output and boost its production to the
equivalent of 4.573 million barrels a day, surpassing Exxon''s
2011 average of 4.506 million. Rosneft''s output will also exceed
that of every Middle Eastern country except Saudi Arabia. </p>
<p>Upon completion, Rosneft''s deal will rank as the third-
biggest oil acquisition on record, trailing only Exxon''s $87.7
billion merger with Mobil Corp. in 1999 and BP''s $61.9 billion
purchase of Amoco Corp. the same year, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. </p>
<h2>Exxon''s Acquisitions </h2>
<p>In the past five weeks, Exxon agreed to spend about $5
billion on oil and gas fields in Canada and the U.S. Great
Plains, bringing the total allocated to acquisitions since June
2010 to more than $40 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson has been
struggling with production declines as fields discovered decades
ago peter out and national governments in the Middle East and
Latin America prohibit exploration by foreign businesses or make
it too expensive. </p>
<p>Global output probably dropped at Exxon for a fifth
straight quarter during the July-to-September period, according
to Argus Research Corp. That would be the longest streak of
declines in 13 years, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Exxon is
scheduled to release third-quarter results on Nov. 1. Its
reserve growth slowed to 0.5 percent last year after jumping 7.9
percent and 8.9 percent in 2010 and 2009, respectively. </p>
<h2>Less Discovery </h2>
<p>Exxon is lagging behind rivals in finding new energy
sources. It discovered enough oil and natural gas last year to
replace 107 percent of what it pumped from wells, a so-called
reserve-replacement ratio that was less than one-third that of
Rosneft, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It also lagged behind
the 148 percent ratio at Anadarko and 167 percent at EOG. </p>
<p>Exxon is focused on acquiring companies with vast tracts of
unexplored acreage, rather than firms that churn out large
volumes of crude or gas every day, said Duane Grubert, an
analyst at Susquehanna International Group LLP. in Stamford,
Connecticut. That''s a shift from the 1990s and early 2000s, when
some of the largest oil-industry deals targeted producers such
as Texaco Inc. and Unocal Corp., he said. </p>
<p>Anadarko''s wealth of potential future output means Exxon
would need to offer at least $102 a share for the company, said
Joseph Magner, an analyst at Macquarie in Denver. That''s 53
percent more than yesterday''s closing level of $66.55 and values
its equity at $51 billion. </p>
<p>Today, Anadarko shares slipped 0.1 percent to $66.49. </p>
<h2>Prosperidade, Golfinho </h2>
<p>The company is still trying to determine how much gas is
locked in its trio of offshore Mozambique discoveries known as
Prosperidade, Golfinho and Atum. </p>
<p>These are big fields that just keep getting bigger as
drilling proceeds, Ernest Leyendecker, the company''s exploration
chief, told analysts at a Johnson Rice  Co. conference in New
Orleans on Oct. 2. </p>
<p>Anadarko''s other attractive qualities include a stake in
the Jubilee oilfield on the other side of the African continent,
in the waters off Ghana, and exploratory prospects off the
coasts of Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast. Exxon has been
interested in Jubilee since at least 2009, when it made an
unsuccessful $4 billion bid for some assets of Kosmos Energy
Ltd. (KOS), which discovered the field and is now developing the
project in partnership with Anadarko. </p>
<p>EOG might also satisfy Exxon''s needs, according to Cameron Horwitz, head of exploration and production research at U.S.
Capital Advisors in Houston. </p>
<h2>Most Coveted'' </h2>
<p>It has one of the most coveted asset bases among U.S.
onshore exploration companies, Horwitz said. The company''s
prime asset is an almost 650,000-acre tract in Texas''s Eagle
Ford Shale formation, where wells are yielding crude and so-
called gas liquids such as propane, which command higher prices
than gas alone, he said. </p>
<p>In the past 18 months, EOG has discovered it can drill
twice as many wells on a given area without draining gas liquids
from neighboring wells, an indication the formation holds far
more reserves than previously thought, Horwitz said. He said EOG
is worth at least $149 a share, a 33 percent premium to
yesterday''s close of $112.42. That would value the company at
$40.2 billion, compared with Exxon''s market capitalization of
$417.4 billion. </p>
<p>EOG gained 1.5 percent to $114.09 today. </p>
<p>EOG isn''t just going to give the company away, Horwitz
said of the premium. It''s a big pill to swallow. Obviously,
only a very select group of buyers could do that. </p>
<h2>Apache''s Allure </h2>
<p>Apache Corp. (APA), the Houston-based energy producer that
replaced 113 percent of the reserves it pumped out of the ground
last year, is another tempting target for Exxon, according to
Capital One Southcoast Inc.''s Eliot Javanmardi. The company''s
market capitalization was $32.4 billion yesterday. </p>
<p>Today, Apache shares fell 0.5 percent to $82.36. </p>
<p>Apache''s discoveries in places like Canada''s Liard Basin
constitute an embarrassment of riches, the New Orleans-based
analyst said. It is a massive, massive find that may hold as
much as 40 trillion cubic feet of gas, he said. </p>
<p>John Roper, a spokesman at Apache, said the company''s
policy is to not comment on market speculation. </p>
<p>Buying Anadarko, EOG or Apache would give Exxon a business
that''s growing at least six times as fast as its own. Analysts
project Anadarko will boost revenue 26.9 percent through 2014,
while EOG''s sales may climb 37 percent and Apache''s could rise
20.7 percent, estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. Exxon may
report sales of about $447 billion that year, just a 3 percent
increase from 2011, the data show. </p>
<h2>None Needed </h2>
<p>Exxon doesn''t need to respond to Rosneft''s acquisition with
its own large deal because it has enough opportunities to grow
and increase production on its own, according to Anthony Walker
of Exxon shareholder Ariel Investments LLC. </p>
<p>I would be a little bit concerned if they felt that they
needed to respond to what their competitors are doing because it
probably signals that they would be going after lower-return
opportunities, Walker, an energy analyst for Chicago-based
Ariel Investments, which oversees $4.7 billion, said in a phone
interview. They do have some avenues to production growth
outside of acquisitions. </p>
<p>Exxon''s biggest transaction in more than a decade, the 2010
purchase of XTO Energy Inc. for $34.9 billion, turned out to
be kind of a dud, Susquehanna''s Grubert said in a phone
interview. </p>
<h2>Prices Plunge </h2>
<p>XTO was targeted because of its North American gas fields
and its expertise in drilling shale formations, he said. The
deal proved poorly timed as a supply glut drove down prices.
Natural-gas futures lost more than half their value between June
2010, when Exxon completed its deal for Fort Worth, Texas-based
XTO, and April of this year, when prices sank to a 10-year low. </p>
<p>They bought that company for a skill set and a different
kind of gas market, Grubert said. </p>
<p>While Exxon is still working to integrate the XTO
acquisition, the company has a strong enough balance sheet to
undertake another large transaction, such as buying EOG or
Apache, said Todd Lowenstein, a Los Angeles-based fund manager
at HighMark Capital Management Inc., which oversees about $17
billion. Exxon''s cash and near-cash items exceed total debt by
$2.22 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>XTO was a very sizable deal for them, and they haven''t
quite harvested the returns yet, he said in a phone interview.
So they may be gun-shy. </p>
<p>Still, there are a lot of assets in play right now, and I
wouldn''t be surprised if Exxon is looking, he said. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) faces a preliminary
investigation by European data protection regulators who are
examining potential privacy issues raised by changes to policies
for Internet products including Hotmail and Bing. </p>
<p>Updates to Microsoft''s services agreement, which took
effect Oct. 19, are being reviewed by Luxembourg''s data
protection commission in collaboration with other European Union
privacy regulators, said Gerard Lommel, president of the
Luxembourgish agency. </p>
<p>U.S. companies sometimes run afoul of privacy concerns in
Europe, where rules protecting individuals'' data are stricter
than in America. Data protection authorities in the EU earlier
this month urged Google Inc. (GOOG) to address concerns about its
privacy policy. </p>
<p>This investigation is not at the same level as the probe
concerning Google was a few months ago when it changed its
privacy policy, where clear privacy issues had been
identified, Lommel said in an interview today. Potential
issues with Microsoft''s upgrade can neither be excluded nor
confirmed. </p>
<p>The goal is to check whether the amendment to Microsoft''s
policies could entail new risks for users'' privacy. The
examination is also checking whether Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft''s privacy policy meets European standards on notice
and choice of services, Lommel said. </p>
<h2>Services Agreement </h2>
<p>Robin Koch, a spokesman for Microsoft in Brussels, said the
changes don''t alter the company''s existing privacy policies. </p>
<p>We recognize we could have been clearer about this when
we rolled out our updated services agreement, Koch said in an
e-mailed statement. We will update the agreement as soon as
possible to make that point absolutely clear. </p>
<p>Data protection is currently policed by separate regulators
across the EU. As part of an overhaul of the union''s 17-year-old
rules on the issue, its executive body wants to simplify the
system so companies deal with only one regulator in the region. </p>
<p>The Luxembourg commission, in close cooperation with the
French and other European data protection authorities, is
examining the policy in this case because Microsoft''s service
agreement with users falls under Luxembourg law, said Lommel. </p>
<p>Facebook Inc. (FB), which has its European base in Ireland,
earlier this year was subject to an audit by the Irish data
protection authority into privacy issues with its facial-
recognition feature. France''s National Commission for Computing
and Civil Liberties, or CNIL, led the probe into Google''s new
privacy policy, announcing last week that the company must fix
flaws in the update or face possible fines. </p>

<p>Brazilian swaps traders are
overestimating how soon the central bank will reverse course and
raise borrowing costs from a record low, said Paulo Leme, the
chief of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s offices in the country. </p>
<p>Policy makers are likely to keep the benchmark rate at 7.25
percent through the end of 2013, Leme said in a speech today at
a Brazilian pension fund conference in Sao Paulo. Traders are
betting the central bank will raise the rate, know as Selic, by
75 basis points, or 0.75 percentage point, next year, starting
with a 25 basis-point increase as soon as May, swap rates show. </p>
<p>I''m more dovish, Leme said. </p>
<p>Brazil cut the target lending rate for a 10th straight
meeting on Oct. 10, bringing it down from 12.5 percent in August
2011, to revive the slowest growth among major emerging-market
economies. Keeping interest rates stable for a sufficiently
prolonged period is the best strategy to ensure inflation
converges to the country''s 4.5 percent, the central bank said in
the minutes of its Oct. 9-10 meeting. </p>
<p>Developed nations face a long and painful deleveraging
process that will weigh on global growth and provide room for
Brazil to keep rates at record lows, Leme said. </p>
<p>Brazilian pension funds seeking higher returns in coming
years will abandon lower-yielding government debt in favor of
alternative investments in industries including infrastructure,
real estate and private equity, he said. </p>

<p>General Electric Capital Corp. and
Toyota Motor Credit Corp. have each increased market share in
the shrinking U.S. structured notes market, selling more than
twice as many of the securities as the same period last year. </p>
<p>General Electric Capital, the largest non-bank structured
note issuer in the U.S., sold $525 million of rate-linked
structured notes this year, 3.5 times more than last year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Toyota has sold $215
million in rate-linked notes, more than twice as much as in
2011. </p>
<p>Investors are buying more structured notes from non-bank
issuers this year because their credit ratings are typically
higher than those of financial firms, said Bill Pang, manager of
derivatives and structured finance at Toyota Motor Credit Corp
in Torrance, California. Since structured notes rely on the
issuer''s promise to pay its obligation, investors want to have
different kinds of issuers, he said. </p>
<p>What we''re doing this year is capitalizing on investor
demand of increasing yield while diversifying bank-sponsored
deals whose ratings have suffered over the year, he said in a
telephone interview. </p>
<p>Toyota Motor Credit is rated Aa3 with a negative outlook by
Moody''s Investors Service. General Electric Capital is rated A1
with a stable outlook. Bank of America Corp., the largest U.S.
issuer of structured notes, is rated Baa2 with a negative
outlook. </p>
<h2>Cash Reserves </h2>
<p>In 2007, Toyota sold more than $2.5 billion in structured
notes, the most in a calendar year for the company and 11 times
what has been sold this year, Pang said. That number includes
notes registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission and private transactions, he said. </p>
<p>One of the key reasons there hasn''t been a lot of
issuance is that there is a lot of cash on hand in these
entities, said Ian Merrill, director of U.S. investor
solutions at Barclays Plc (BARC) in New York. Tactical acquisitions
have been contemplated for a long time, but they''re still not
doing them because of uncertainty in the economy, he said. </p>
<p>Sales of structured notes in the U.S. are down 19 percent,
compared with the same week last year, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>We look at all options all the time -- it''s business as
usual for us, said Russell Wilkerson, spokesmen for GE
Capital, in an e-mail. </p>
<p>Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather. </p>

<p>Walter Energy Inc. (WLT), a producer of
steelmaking coal in the U.S. and Canada, anticipates taking as
much as a $1.1 billion goodwill impairment charge in the third
quarter because of recent weakness in global demand. </p>
<p>Preliminary indications are that all or substantially all
of the company''s $1.1 billion of goodwill could be impaired and
a corresponding non-cash charge recognized, Birmingham,
Alabama-based Walter said today in a statement. The company is
scheduled to release earnings Nov. 5 and is expected to report
$34.8 million in net income for the quarter, according to the
average of nine analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Slowing output from steelmakers and the increased
Australian production have caused prices for metallurgical coal,
used to make steel, to tumble. Prices have dropped 39 percent in
the past 12 months to $160 a ton as of Oct. 19, according to the
most recent weekly data from Knoxville, Tennessee-based Energy
Publishing Inc. </p>
<p>Walter paid C$5.32 billion ($5.34 billion) in 2011 to
acquire Vancouver-based Western Coal Corp., adding reserves of
metallurgical coal. As slow economic growth damped coal demand,
the shares have declined 40 percent this year, a steeper fall
than the 23 percent drop for the 35-member Stowe Global Coal
Index. (COAL) </p>
<p>Given the drop in met coal and slower global growth
expectations, the fair value for the Western Coal assets has
fallen below the value paid by Walter to acquire the company in
2011, Kuni Chen, a Stamford, Connecticut-based analyst for CRT
Capital Group LLC, said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>Walter rose 0.2 percent to $36.30 at 9:34 a.m. in New York. </p>

<p>(Corrects number of power plants and GE''s role starting in
headline in story originally published on Oct. 24.) </p>
<p>General Electric Co. is partnering
with Kenyan government and industry to develop 1,000 megawatts
of power in the East African nation and is in talks with Kenya
Power Ltd. (KPLL) about a power-purchase agreement. </p>
<p>The power projects will probably be developed over five to
10 years, Jay Ireland, president and chief executive officer for
Africa said in a phone interview. He didn''t give a price for the
partnership in which his company will provide technology and
equipment. </p>
<p>We are in the process of working with Kenya Power to
develop a power purchase agreement shortly, he said. GE, as
the company is known, in May signed an agreement with the
government to develop power, rail, health care, aviation and
training projects, he said. </p>
<p>Kenya plans to spend as much as $50 billion over the next
20 years to meet a 14 percent annual increase in electricity
demand, according to the country''s Energy Regulatory Commission.
Kenya, east Africa''s biggest economy, will need 16,905 megawatts
annually by 2031 from 1,520 megawatts this year, the regulator
said. </p>
<p>GE signed similar development agreements with the
governments of Nigeria and Ghana. Under the accord with Kenya,
It will develop wind-energy projects and refurbish rail
locomotives in partnership with Rift Valley Railways, Ireland
said. The company would be interested in building locomotives
for Kenya''s proposed railway line to South Sudan and Ethiopia,
he said. </p>
<h2>Angola Power </h2>
<p>The Fairfield, Connecticut-based company supplies jet
engines for the Boeing 787s and Embraer planes flown by Kenya
Airways Ltd. (KNAL), sub-Saharan Africa''s third-biggest carrier and one
of GE''s main customers in the East African region. In Tanzania,
it has power generation projects and is providing health care
equipment in Ethiopia and Rwanda. </p>
<p>In Angola, where GE is already supplying oil and gas
companies, the company will seek power generation
opportunities, Ireland said. </p>
<p>We are looking at mostly utilizing gas or diesel, he
said, without giving more details. </p>
<p>Angola is Africa''s second-biggest oil producer after
Nigeria. The southern African nation said Oct. 19 it will start
six diesel power stations to supply the capital Luanda by the
end of this year. Angola is expected to have economic growth of
6.8 percent this year, according to the International Monetary
Fund, as it pumps about 1.7 million barrels of oil a day. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) surrounded
its headquarters with sandbags, and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) closed
flood-prone offices as water driven by Hurricane Sandy lapped
into Manhattan. </p>
<p>Banks shifted duties to other cities and had some New York-
based employees working at home as exchanges closed so financial
industry employees wouldn''t risk their lives amid the largest
Atlantic tropical storm system recorded. Sandy forced the halt
of subways and the interruption of electricity, and U.S. stock
trading was canceled yesterday and today, the first time weather
caused consecutive days of shutdowns for exchanges since 1888. </p>
<p>Predictions of an 11-foot storm surge prompted Goldman
Sachs to stack sandbags around its West Street office in Lower
Manhattan, home to some of the world''s largest financial firms,
as the city ordered downtown neighborhoods evacuated. Partial
shutdowns included offices of the nation''s three biggest banks,
JPMorgan, Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. (C) </p>
<p>We operate in 60 countries and have these types of events
happen outside the U.S. more commonly than they do in places
like New York, said JPMorgan co-Chief Operating Officer Frank Bisignano in a Bloomberg Television interview with Erik Schatzker and Stephanie Ruhle. We''ve seen tsunamis in Asia,
we''ve seen floods in India and managed through volcanoes in
Chile. Until the event occurs, you really don''t know the impact
on your business. </p>
<p>Fixed-income trading at Goldman Sachs was mostly limited to
money markets and ensuring clients had funding they needed to
meet obligations that are coming due, said a person familiar
with the bank, who declined to be identified because the
information is private. Plans may be the same today, according
to the person. </p>
<h2>Power Cut </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs is counting on employees in locations
including London and Salt Lake City, with the West Street office
scheduled to be closed today, according to a memo from Chief
Administrative Officer Jeffrey Schroeder. </p>
<p>Consolidated Edison Inc., New York City''s utility, said
late yesterday it was cutting power to parts of lower Manhattan
as flood waters threatened underground electrical systems. The
cuts affected more than 5,000 customers, the utility said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, closed all buildings and
branches in New York''s Zone A, the mandatory evacuation area,
the four main heads of retail and mortgage operations said in an
e-mail to the bank''s 160,000 retail employees. Bisignano said in
the interview the New York-based company has about 35,000 people
who may be affected by the storm. </p>
<h2>Very Light'' </h2>
<p>While some trading still occurred, it was a very light
day, I mean very, very light, Bisignano said. Even though
there''s fabulous remote ability by every company in this
industry, including by our clients, you saw most people focused
on safety at home. </p>
<p>More than 20,000 of Morgan Stanley (MS)''s employees used remote
connections to work from home, according to a staff memo from
Jim Rosenthal, chief operating officer of the New York-based
investment bank. </p>
<p>Citigroup''s main U.S.-based trading office at 388-390
Greenwich Ave. is included in New York''s mandatory evacuation
order, as are some branches and an office at 111 Wall St.,
according to the bank. </p>
<p>Bank of America, the second-biggest U.S. lender by assets,
said it closed its offices at Two and Four World Financial
Center as well as all of its New York City branches and Merrill
Lynch wealth-management offices in New York and the mid-Atlantic
markets. </p>
<p>American Express Co. (AXP), the credit-card lender with
headquarters in Lower Manhattan, will shut all its offices in
the tri-state region today, the second straight day of closures,
a spokeswoman said. </p>
<h2>European Banks </h2>
<p>European-based firms including Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Credit
Suisse, UBS AG (UBSN) and BNP Paribas SA (BNP), which have offices outside of
the mandatory evacuation zone, made arrangements to provide
transportation and hotels for workers. </p>
<p>UBS booked hotels for staff in Manhattan, Stamford,
Connecticut, and Weehawken, New Jersey, according to Karina Byrne, a spokeswoman at the Zurich-based bank. Paris-based BNP
Paribas told all non-critical workers to work from home and is
providing hotel rooms for staff who are reporting to the office,
said Cesaltine Gregorio, a New York-based spokeswoman. </p>
<p>Societe Generale SA (GLE), France''s second-largest bank by market
value, told most of its staff in New York City and New Jersey to
stay home, said Jim Galvin, a spokesman for the Paris-based
bank. </p>

The campaign, which will begin in the coming weeks, will focus on the product and how users can personalize phones, he said. </p> <p>Gruhler also noted that Verizon, which had previously sold only one Windows Phone model in the two years the devices have been on the market, is showing a new level of commitment by selling three different models this holiday. </p> <p>Helping to boost Microsoft''s case with consumers, Windows Phone now has 120,000 apps, including 46 of the top 50 on rival phones, Microsoft''s Belfiore said. Pandora, for example, had been a long-time holdout. </p> <p>There are more than 700,000 apps on Apple''s store, including more than 275,000 specifically for the iPad tablet computer. There are about 700,000 apps for Android devices, Google said. </p> <h2>Apple''s Popularity </h2> <p>Operating on phones with a dual-core chip and high- definition screens, Windows 8 supports near-field communication technology, which lets customers use phones to make payments.

There is some growth, with second quarter market share climbing from 2.3 percent a year earlier, according to IDC. </p> <p>Still, Microsoft as a whole is grappling with the shift to mobile computing, with first fiscal quarter profit and sales missing analysts'' estimates. For the first time in a decade, the total PC market will contract this year, by 1.2 percent to 348.7 million units, according to IHS ISuppli. </p> <p>Microsoft, which is revamping its software across the board, introduced Windows 8, a new version of its software for PCs, last week. With the suite of new software, the company is aiming to push Windows, which dominated the market over the past two decades by running on nine out of every 10 personal computers, into mobile computing. </p> <p>Microsoft shares advanced 1.2 percent to close at $28.21 in New York on Oct. 26, and are up 8.7 percent so far this year.

<p>The alleged data rigging by
Argentina that cost inflation-linked bondholders $7 billion and
earned the nation a rebuke from the International Monetary Fund
is now turning MetLife Inc. against its banker. </p>
<p>The local unit of the largest U.S. life insurer is suing
JPMorgan Chase  Co. to recoup $107 million in losses on notes
securitized by the lender, claiming the biggest U.S. bank by
assets used government inflation data that is estimated to be
less than half the actual rate to value the debt. The underlying
bonds lost 9.5 percent in dollars this year, the biggest drop
among inflation-linked debt in Latin America, after plunging 25
percent in 2011, according to Barclays Plc. Economists estimate
inflation at 24 percent, versus the official rate of 9 percent. </p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed in London, is emblematic of the mistrust
Argentina has sowed since it fired statisticians in 2007 and
began reporting consumer prices that economists say are
inaccurate. That''s shut the nation out of its own bond market
and caused trading in notes tied to consumer prices to dry up.
Unable to sell debt overseas since its record default in 2001,
Argentina has also imposed currency controls and seized oil
producer YPF SA in the past year as it faces borrowing costs
that are twice the average in emerging markets. </p>
<p>Inflation-linked bonds have fallen off the map,
Leonardo Chialva, a partner at Delphos Investment in Buenos
Aires, said in a telephone interview. They barely trade among
a reduced, highly speculative group of investors who are not
looking at the fundamentals because they depend on the highly
subjective and arbitrary component that is official inflation. </p>
<h2>Good Faith'' </h2>
<p>Spokesmen for JPMorgan and MetLife declined to comment
about ongoing litigation. Officials at Argentina''s Economy
Ministry didn''t return calls seeking comment. </p>
<p>Metropolitan Life Seguros de Retiro SA alleges that by
using the government''s data, JPMorgan paid less interest on
securities that were created by the bank and tied to the
performance of underlying Argentine bonds, according to court
documents filed in September and made available last week.
JPMorgan put the redemption value of the notes at $177 million,
a figure based on official inflation, while MetLife said their
value should have been $284 million. </p>
<p>The Argentine unit of the New York-based insurer says a
clause in the bond contract stipulates that JPMorgan was
required to determine consumer prices in good faith and in a
commercially reasonable manner based in available market
information, in the event the country''s official data was
deemed unreliable. Instead, New York-based JPMorgan used
official inflation that one of its analysts deemed grossly
distorted, MetLife said. </p>
<h2>U.S. Ruling </h2>
<p>Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has said
since taking office in December 2007 that her government''s data
is accurate. </p>
<p>In a separate case, Argentina lost a bid to reverse U.S.
court rulings on Oct. 26 that may help creditors including
billionaire Paul Singer''s hedge fund Elliott Management Corp.
collect $1.4 billion on defaulted debt, sparking the biggest
decline in the country''s bonds in four months. </p>
<p>The government''s dollar-denominated notes due in 2015 fell
4.98 cents to 84.55 cents on the dollar, pushing yields to an
almost three-month high 13.82 percent, after the U.S. Appeals
Court in New York ruled that Argentina can''t discriminate
against holders of the defaulted bonds in favor of those that
own the securities it restructured following the default. </p>
<p>New York-based Elliot Management this month won a court
order in Ghana to seize an Argentine navy frigate when it docked
in the West African nation on a training mission. </p>
<h2>Captive Buyers'' </h2>
<p>The nation''s foreign-exchange restrictions, which Fernandez
imposed after her re-election in October 2011, have also
undermined trading in inflation-linked bonds, according to
Bulltick Capital Markets. </p>
<p>In the unregulated market, which traders use to acquire
dollars by buying assets locally in pesos and selling them
abroad in U.S. currency, the peso has weakened 27 percent this
year to 6.5252 pesos per dollar. </p>
<p>Basically, everybody bailed on that trade, Alberto Bernal, head of fixed-income research at Bulltick, said in a
telephone interview. Local trading is mostly arbitrage by
captive buyers at this point. </p>
<p>Argentina''s credit-rating outlook last month was revised to
negative from stable by Moody''s Investors Service, which said
misreporting inflation data has resulted in the underpayment of
holders of inflation-linked bonds. </p>
<h2>Moody''s Downgrades </h2>
<p>Combined with the $8.9 billion still owed to the Paris Club
of creditor nations, the underpayment demonstrates a lack of
willingness to pay back creditors, according to Moody''s. The
country is rated B3, six levels below investment grade. </p>
<p>Moody''s lowered the foreign debt ratings of three Argentine
banks from B2 to B3 on Oct. 26, citing the risk that debtors
will be unable to access foreign currency. </p>
<p>South America''s second-biggest economy is on track to be
the first country censured by the IMF for not sharing accurate
inflation data. The IMF''s board of directors gave Argentina
until Dec. 17 to respond to its concerns. After that, the board
can issue a declaration of censure. </p>
<p>Enrique Alvarez, the New York-based head of Latin America
fixed-income research at IdeaGlobal, says the threat of a
downgrade and censure by IMF won''t compel the Argentine
government to change its inflation data. </p>
<p>Argentina is not going to fully budge, he said in a
telephone interview. You see that in their actions. I don''t
believe that they''ll make an immediate U-turn and start
reporting something that would cost them. </p>
<h2>Blow Up'' </h2>
<p>Last year, Fernandez fined economists for reporting
independent inflation estimates, prompting opposition lawmakers
to compile the reports and publish them anonymously. </p>
<p>In September, she questioned whether U.S. inflation was
close to 2 percent and told a Georgetown University student in a
televised conference that if inflation in Argentina was 25
percent, the country would blow up. </p>
<p>The extra yield, or spread, investors demand to hold
Argentine government dollar bonds instead of Treasuries swelled
six basis points to 993 at 12:32 p.m. in Buenos Aires, according
to JPMorgan. </p>
<p>The cost of protecting Argentine debt against non-payment
for five years with credit-default swaps surged 246 basis points
to 1,533, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The swaps pay the
buyer face value in exchange for the underlying securities or
cash if a government or company fails to comply with debt
agreements. </p>
<p>The peso was little changed at 4.7537 per dollar. </p>
<p>Edwin Gutierrez, who helps manage $9 billion of emerging-
market debt at Aberdeen Asset Management Plc and owned Argentine
inflation-linked bonds in the past, says MetLife may be locked
in a legal battle with JPMorgan for years. </p>
<p>This will be a long, drawn-out battle, Gutierrez said
in a telephone interview from London. Good luck with that. </p>

<h2>News </h2>
<h2>NFL Asks Judge to Dismiss Vilma Move to Disqualify Tagliabue </h2>
<p>The National Football League said there''s no basis for
disqualifying its former commissioner, Paul Tagliabue, from
arbitrating a dispute over New Orleans Saints player Jonathan Vilma''s full-season suspension for alleged bounty-hunting. </p>
<p>The NFL called the move to take Tagliabue off the case an
untoward and baseless demand that has no merit,
according to a filing Oct. 26 in federal court in New Orleans. </p>
<p>Vilma argued in court filings this week that Tagliabue has
a conflict of interest because he is a senior counsel with the
law firm representing the current NFL commissioner, Roger Goodell. Vilma also said the firm, Covington  Burling LLP, has
represented the NFL since at least 2006 and collected millions
of dollars in legal fees from the league. </p>
<p>Tagliabue now has been placed in a position of presiding
over a matter in which one of his firm''s most important clients,
the NFL, and one of his longtime colleagues have an undeniable
interest, Vilma''s attorneys said in a court filing. </p>
<p>The NFL claimed that about two dozen Saints players paid
one another as much as $1,500 for trying to injure opposing
players including quarterback Brett Favre. The players have
denied the league''s allegations. </p>
<p>The league announced Tagliabue''s appointment as appellate
arbitrator on Oct. 19. He will decide whether Goodell''s
disciplinary ruling was proper. </p>
<p>Tagliabue served as NFL commissioner from 1989 until 2006,
when Goodell replaced him. </p>
<p>The NFL said that Tagliabue hasn''t represented the league
in any matter since returning to Covington  Burling in 2007. </p>
<p>Commissioner Tagliabue has had no personal involvement in
the investigation, arbitration or litigation of the bounty
matter, NFL lawyers said in the filing. </p>
<p>The league said it will be represented by the law firm
Debevoise  Plimpton LLP at an appellate hearing for Vilma and
the other three players set for Oct. 30. </p>
<p>The case is Vilma v. Goodell, 12-1283, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of Louisiana (New Orleans). </p>
<h2>California Withdraws Mitchell as Mediator in PGE Pipe Talks </h2>
<p>The California Public Utilities Commission withdrew a
proposal for former U.S. Senator George Mitchell to serve as
mediator in settlement talks with PGE Corp. (PCG) over potential
fines from a 2010 pipeline blast. </p>
<p>Mitchell was removed after consumer advocacy groups and the
cities of San Bruno and San Francisco objected to his selection,
the commission said in a statement. The groups said they weren''t
consulted on Mitchell''s selection and his law firm, DLA Piper
LLP, had a conflict of interest in the case. </p>
<p>An explosion on a PGE natural gas pipeline killed eight
people and destroyed 38 homes in San Bruno in September 2010.
The California commission suspended hearings into PGE''s role in
the pipeline blast earlier this month in an effort to reach a
negotiated settlement on penalties. </p>
<p>Unless a stipulation can be reached, I am worried it
might take until mid-next year before these cases can be
concluded in the normal litigation manner, Michael Peevey,
president of the commission, said in the statement. We want
justice and remedies much sooner than that, to get closure and
true justice for the people of San Bruno. </p>
<p>PGE supports settlement negotiations and we will
continue to support them as a party to this process, Brittany
Chord, a spokeswoman for the San Francisco-based utility, said
in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>The withdrawal of the mediator indicates that the
negotiations could be in a more difficult position as
several parties now seem to be voicing more skepticism about
the role the CPUC might be playing in the negotiations, said
Paul Patterson, a New York-based utility analyst with Glenrock
Associates LLC, in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<h2>Berlusconi Sentenced to Prison for Mediaset Tax Fraud </h2>
<p>Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who
describes himself as the most persecuted man in history, was
found guilty of tax fraud and sentenced to four years in prison
in a film-rights case involving his Mediaset SpA (MS) television
company. </p>
<p>Berlusconi''s lawyers, Niccolo Ghedini and Piero Longo,
called the verdict absolutely incredible and lacking legal
logic, in an e-mailed statement. They plan to file an appeal
of the decision, and said they trust that a higher court
will overturn the verdict. Berlusconi can appeal the verdict two
more times under Italian law. </p>
<p>It is unlikely that Berlusconi will serve any jail time
given his age, 76, and the Italian appeals process, which can
run out the statute of limitations. The court pardoned three
years of the sentence. He was also barred from public office for
five years, according to a sentence read Oct. 26 by a judge in
Milan. </p>
<p>He won''t go to jail because criminal sentences in the
first instance aren''t executed if an appeal is presented within
15 days, said Fabio Belloni, a criminal lawyer who previously
defended Parmalat (PLT) Chairman Calisto Tanzi in Italy''s biggest
bankruptcy case. </p>
<p>The sentence remains suspended until the end of the
appeals process. The same thing with the ban from public
office,'''' he said. </p>
<p>The ruling comes as Berlusconi faces another trial on
charges of paying for sex with a minor. The revelations about
his relationship with a 17-year-old Milan nightclub dancer and
the so-called Bunga Bunga parties he threw at his Milan
residence led to a slump in his popularity last year that
contributed to his resignation as prime minister in November. </p>
<p>There will be consequences,'''' Berlusconi said Oct. 27 in
an interview on the news bulletin of his Mediaset Spa''s Canale 5
when asked to comment on the verdict. I feel forced to remain
in politics to reform the justice system, so that what happened
to me will not happen to other citizens.'''' </p>
<h2>Deals </h2>
<h2>Mergers to Get Boost in 2013 Regardless of Election, Varney Says </h2>
<p>Merger activity will see a boost next year, said the former
chief of the U.S. Justice Department''s antitrust unit, Christine Varney, head of Cravath, Swaine  Moore LLP''s antitrust
practice. She predicted that the winner of the White House won''t
have a significant impact on the field. </p>
<p>I see it very, very busy in my own practice, Varney
said in a panel Oct. 25 at the Bloomberg Dealmakers Summit in
New York, at which she and former Securities and Exchange
Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt downplayed the impact of the
presidential election. </p>
<p>Varney, a former U.S. Assistant Attorney General, said she
has half a dozen projects brewing and has observed the
availability of a lot of capital on the sidelines,
especially in areas such as emerging industries looking to
augment portfolios. She predicts a lot of MA in 2013. </p>
<p>Levitt, a senior adviser to the Carlyle Group LP (CG) and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and a board member of Bloomberg News
parent Bloomberg LP, dismissed arguments that President Barack Obama''s administration has been heavy-handed with new rules,
saying regulation is on shakier ground that it''s been in many,
many years. </p>
<p>The congressional committees that oversee the regulators
are universally in the pockets of the companies being
regulated, Levitt said, accusing Congress of pushing such laws
as the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act that threatens
investor safety. Investors have never been more exposed. </p>

<h2>Buffett''s Berkshire Wins ResCap Auction With $1.5 Billion Offer </h2>
<p>Munger, Tolles  Olson LLP partners Thomas B. Walper, Seth
Goldman, Mary Ann Todd and Brett J. Rodda advised Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A), which won an auction for a portfolio of
Residential Capital LLC''s loans with a $1.5 billion bid, adding
to Warren Buffett''s bet on a housing market recovery. </p>
<p>Morrison  Foerster LLP is ResCap''s law firm handling the
bankruptcy case. Partners include Larren Nashelsky, Gary Lee,
Lorenzo Marinuzzi, Todd Goren and Norman Rosenbaum. </p>
<p>The competing bidder was a group that included a unit of
Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), according to two people familiar with
the matter, who declined to be identified because they weren''t
authorized to speak publicly. </p>
<p>ResCap auctioned its mortgage-servicing business to Ocwen
Financial Corp. (OCN) on Oct. 24 for $3 billion. Ocwen beat Nationstar
Mortgage Holdings Inc. (NSM) in an auction that would create at least
the fifth-largest U.S. mortgage servicer. </p>
<p>Mayer Brown LLP served as primary deal counsel to Ocwen
Loan Servicing. Banking and finance partners Jon Van Gorp as
well as John Lawlor and corporate and securities/mergers and
acquisitions partner Bill Kucera worked on the deal. </p>
<p>Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY), a Detroit-based auto lender majority
owned by U.S. taxpayers, allowed its New York-based ResCap unit
to file for bankruptcy in May to distance itself from the
mortgage lender''s losses and help repay its 2008 bailout
following the U.S. housing crash and subsequent credit crisis.
Ally was previously owned by General Motors Corp. </p>
<p>ResCap''s board approved Berkshire''s offer for the portfolio
of about 47,000 whole loans as the highest and best bid,
according to a statement. The agreement must now be approved by
the bankruptcy court. A hearing is set for Nov. 19. The two
auctions were expected to generate about $4 billion, ResCap said
in a May 14 statement announcing its bankruptcy. </p>
<p>The case is In re Residential Capital LLC, 12-12020, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<h2>Litigation </h2>
<h2>BBC Faces Lawsuits by TV Star''s Alleged Sex-Abuse Victims </h2>
<p>The British Broadcasting Corp. may be weighed down for
years by a wave of civil lawsuits and reputational damage
resulting from allegations of decades of sexual abuse of
children by former television star Jimmy Savile. </p>
<p>London police are probing allegations that Savile, who died
last year at the age of 84, may have abused more than 300 people
as early as 1959. Claims may reach the BBC''s highest ranks if
there was a cover-up to save its reputation, said Mark Burden, a
liability insurance director at Prime Professions Ltd. </p>
<p>If there''s some systemic issue about the way the
institution was being run, obviously the directors or officers
who were there at the time could be held accountable, Burden
said in London. From a reputational point of view, you just
don''t know how that''s going to affect the business going
forward. It could have significant consequences. </p>
<p>The BBC, the world''s largest public broadcaster, is running
internal probes and cooperating with police and lawmakers
investigating the incidents. It seeks to avoid the type of
damage that befell News Corp. (NWSA)''s U.K. publisher after civil
lawsuits revealed that a phone-hacking conspiracy, with hundreds
of victims, had been covered up for years by executives. </p>
<p>Savile''s alleged victims deserve their day in court,
said Liz Dux, a lawyer at Russell Jones  Walker Solicitors, who
is representing at least 10 people. Many of the potential
claimants have said they told people years earlier about the
abuse and weren''t believed, Dux said. </p>
<p>The victims feel somewhat robbed, because he obviously
cannot be prosecuted and cannot give evidence -- he''s not there
to suffer the repercussions, Dux said of Savile. </p>
<p>BBC Trust spokeswoman Hannah Murdoch declined to comment on
potential suits, saying it may conflict with the internal
investigations. </p>
<p>Previous attempts to investigate Savile failed. A woman
called the Metropolitan Police in 2003 claiming Savile touched
her inappropriately in the 1970s, though she didn''t file a
complaint, Commander Peter Spindler said Oct. 25. Prosecutors
who reviewed similar claims in 2007 didn''t press charges. </p>
<p>The scandal was brought to light in a documentary by
broadcaster ITV Plc (ITV) this month that featured several women
accusing the host of BBC''s Top of the Pops music show of
sexual abuse when they were teens. Savile, who was knighted in
1990, also fronted Jim''ll Fix It, which granted children''s
wishes, such as meeting celebrities. </p>
<p>The BBC will probably be sued for negligence in failing to
stop the TV star and may be forced to pay hundreds of
thousands of pounds to each victim, said David Foster, a
lawyer with Barlow Robbins LLP in Guildford, England, who isn''t
involved in the cases. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX)''s Indonesian unit, the
nation''s largest producer of crude, started a $500 million
expansion of the project at Duri field in Sumatra. </p>
<p>At peak production, the site at North Duri Development Area
13 is forecast to add 17,000 barrels a day to production, PT
Chevron Pacific Indonesia said in an e-mailed statement today. A
Chevron spokesman in Singapore confirmed the news. </p>
<p>The North Duri 13 project will add 539 new wells, including
145 using a technology known as steam injection to increase
production yields, the company said. Steam flooding involves
injecting steam into wells to ease the flow of heavy oil. </p>
<p>The project follows an expansion in Area 12 that was
completed in 2009, adding 40,000 barrels a day to production, it
said. The Duri field is one of the world''s largest steam-flood
projects. </p>
<p>Chevron Pacific may produce 343,212 barrels of oil a day
this year, about 39 percent of Indonesia''s total output,
according to data from the nation''s oil and gas regulator,
BPMigas. </p>
<p>Indonesia is trying to stem production decline as older
fields pump less crude. The nation withdrew from the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in 2008 amid
falling output. </p>

<p>International investors including
Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) are favoring natural gas over oil sands
acquisitions in Canada as the less-expensive way to supply Asian
markets. </p>
<p>Three of the five largest energy acquisitions announced by
foreign buyers in Canada this year, valued at a combined $9.8
billion, were for natural gas assets, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The trend will continue next year as liquefied
natural gas developers move closer to commissioning projects,
said Robert Mark, who helps oversee C$4.5 billion ($4.5 billion)
at MacDougall, MacDougall  MacTier Inc. in Montreal. </p>
<p>There''s a unique scramble in Canada to lock up gas assets
for LNG, he said. Asian buyers look at that as a significant
opportunity. </p>
<p>A race to secure natural gas for planned LNG export on
Canada''s West Coast by Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Exxon and others
has spurred interest in the fossil fuel among investors seeking
to benefit from the price differences between Asia and North
America. With at least five LNG projects valued at as much as
$15 billion each proposed for British Columbia''s northwest
coast, proponents are lining up supplies from reserves such as
the Horn River and the Montney shale formations. </p>
<h2>Record Premium </h2>
<p>Canadian natural gas traded yesterday at C$3.175 per
gigajoule, after more than doubling from a 10-year low of
C$1.4475 on April 20. That compares with about $16 for LNG
contracts sold in Japan. A gigajoule is a unit of energy. About
100 gigajoules of natural gas is required to heat a single
family home in Canada for one year. </p>
<p>Foreign buyers of natural gas producers or assets this year
include Tokyo-based Mitsubishi Corp. (8058), Japan''s largest trading
company; Irving, Texas-based Exxon; and Petroliam Nasional Bhd,
Malayasia''s state-owned oil and gas company. The premiums paid
for those assets have reached as high as 97 percent, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Petroliam Nasional, known as Petronas and based in Kuala
Lumpur, boosted its first offer for Progress Energy Resources
Corp. (PRQ) to C$22, or 97 percent more than the Calgary-based
company''s 20-day average before the initial proposal, the
steepest premium on record in the oil and gas industry. </p>
<p>Petronas yesterday extended its C$5.16 billion offer for
Progress after an initial regulatory rejection by the Canadian
government on Oct. 19. Progress rose 0.4 percent to C$19.89 at
4:19 p.m. today after soaring 8 percent yesterday. </p>
<h2>Deals Increasing </h2>
<p>Exxon, the world''s largest energy company by market value,
agreed to pay C$2.86 billion for Calgary-based Celtic
Exploration Ltd.''s leases in Alberta''s gas-producing Duvernay
and Montney formations on Oct. 17, its biggest Canadian
acquisition. </p>
<p>Canada''s decision on Petronas''s bid will determine how many
more foreign investors are lured to Canada, said John Stephenson, who helps manage C$2.7 billion at First Asset
Investment Management Inc. in Toronto. He owns shares of natural
gas producers including Painted Pony Petroleum Ltd. (PPY) and Crew
Energy Inc. </p>
<p>It remains to be seen how many of these deals get done,
he said in a phone interview. Up until this point, natural gas
deals have been on the upswing. </p>
<p>Producers with holdings in the Montney formation in
northeastern British Columbia, could see bids for assets or
entire companies as LNG proponents secure gas reserves, said
Gordon Currie, analyst at Salman Partners Inc. in Calgary. </p>
<p>You need to have a lot of reserves tied up to support an
LNG export facility so it''s entirely possible they would be out
looking to tie up additional resources, Currie said in a phone
interview. </p>
<h2>Possible Targets </h2>
<p>Targets could include Painted Pony, Talisman Energy Inc. (TLM),
Advantage Oil  Gas Ltd. (AAV), and ARC Resources Ltd. (ARX), Currie said.
Shares of these gas producers, all based in Calgary, have
declined this year through yesterday, with Painted Pony down 5.3
percent; Talisman, 7.2 percent; Advantage, 18 percent; and ARC
Resources, 3.2 percent. </p>
<p>Patrick Ward, Painted Pony''s chief executive officer, was
not immediately available to comment yesterday when contacted by
phone by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Exxon looks for value for its shareholders, Alan Jeffers, a company spokesman said in a phone interview,
yesterday. The company is in the very early stages of
evaluating an LNG terminal for western Canada. </p>
<p>Advantage is considering a strategic review after
announcing in August that it plans to sell non-core assets,
Doug Jackson, a company spokesman said in a phone interview
today. Phoebe Buckland, a spokeswoman for Talisman, did not
immediately respond to an e-mail request for comment. Niki
Anderson, a spokeswoman for ARC Resources, said the company had
nothing to add to its past position on market perceptions it
could be a target. The company is not interested in being taken
over or in pursuing joint ventures, David Carey, ARC Resources
vice president of capital markets, said in a Sept. 14 interview. </p>
<h2>Stranded Gas </h2>
<p>Among companies seeking partners to develop gas reserves in
Canada are Encana Corp., which is marketing a stake in its
Duvernay shale acreage in Alberta and Cutbank Ridge acreage in
British Columbia. </p>
<p>Building infrastructure to allow stranded gas reserves
to reach new markets makes those assets more attractive to
potential investors, said Tim Marchant, an adjunct professor of
energy strategy and geopolitics at the University of Calgary and
a former senior manager at BP Plc. (BP/) </p>
<p>TransCanada Corp. has agreed to develop a 700-kilometer
(434-mile) pipeline in British Columbia to link gas from the
Montney to an LNG project in Kitimat led by Shell. Spectra
Energy Corp. (SE), based in Houston Texas, has signed on with BG
Group Plc (BG/) to build a separate 850 kilometer line from the
Montney to BG''s proposed terminal in Prince Rupert.| </p>
<h2>Oil Sands </h2>
<p>Any time you get a major trunk line built, a lot of
assets that may have been considered stranded, become attractive
because you can evacuate them, Marchant said in a phone
interview. Asian state-owned oil companies are planning in a
very holistic way for energy demand over the next few decades
and North American gas is cheap if you want to add reserves. </p>
<p>Oil sands projects will probably require C$23 billion this
year in investments, according to the Canadian Association of
Petroleum Producers. Foreign companies are holding off on oil
sands purchases, said Wenran Jiang, a University of Alberta
professor and adviser to the Alberta government on Asian
investment. </p>
<p>Asian national energy companies and private investors are
eyeing Western Canadian natural gas reserves as well as
conventional oil deposits outside the oil sands to quench
current supply shortages, Jiang said. </p>
<p>Oil sands are too big in scale, in terms of advanced
investment and the slow pace of return and scale of the
infrastructure building, Jiang said in a telephone interview
from Edmonton on Oct. 26. </p>
<h2>Canada Crude </h2>
<p>Price discounts for Canadian heavy crude, made from oil
sands bitumen, when compared to prices paid for Brent, the
international benchmark, are also working against oil sands
investments, said Mark of MacDougall, MacDougall  MacTier. </p>
<p>As an international investor you look around the globe,
and you see that you''re getting paid in Brent, but with Canadian
heavy crudes, you''re getting a big discount, he said. If
you''re buying assets, you might be more inclined to buy gas or
conventional crude. </p>
<p>U.S. energy companies ConocoPhillips (COP), Marathon Oil Corp.
and Murphy Oil Corp. said they are all considering divesting
oil-sands assets amid industry concerns about project cost
overruns and discounting of Canadian crude prices as export
pipeline capacity is squeezed. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said it
will assess the risk of having two buildings in close proximity
after Hurricane Sandy caused flooding at offices in Manhattan
and across the Hudson River in Jersey City, New Jersey. </p>
<p>It''s one of the things we''ll talk about, Gary Cohn, the
company''s president and chief operating officer, said today in
an interview on Bloomberg Television''s Market Makers
program. They''re very much in similar weather zones, so
clearly something to be thought of. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets and
the largest by equity-trading revenue, surrounded both buildings
with sandbags before the storm deluged lower Manhattan and parts
of New Jersey yesterday. The two office towers, both built
within the past decade, are a ferry ride across the river from
each other. </p>
<p>Some of Goldman Sachs''s Wall Street rivals, such as
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Morgan Stanley, have headquarters in
midtown Manhattan -- on higher ground that escaped flooding. </p>
<p>We''ve gone through all the protective measures we could
to isolate the buildings from each other, including separate
electrical and communications systems, Cohn said, adding that
the firm likes the ease with which it can move employees between
the locations. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs has a total of 3.7 million square feet at its
New York headquarters at 200 West St., which was completed in
2009, and the tower at 30 Hudson St. in Jersey City, according
to an annual filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>
<h2>London, Tokyo </h2>
<p>The firm has more than 1,600 people in Salt Lake City who
can handle some of the bank''s business if the New York and
Jersey City locations are shut down, Cohn said. Goldman Sachs
also can count on London, Hong Kong and Tokyo to assume some
responsibilities, he said. </p>
<p>We have a bunch of conference calls going on trying to
get people to where they need to be, Cohn said, adding that
some employees are within walking distance of headquarters.
Sales and trading personnel are the people that will be our
No. 1 priority to get into the building. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs also is weighing how to help the Battery Park
neighborhood surrounding its headquarters, including allowing
residents to use facilities at the Conrad Hotel adjacent to 200
West St. and owned by the bank, Cohn said. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Executive
Officer Steve Ballmer said 4 million Windows 8 upgrades were
sold to consumers since the flagship operating system for
personal computers went on sale last week. </p>
<p>SAP AG (SAP), Twitter Inc. and Dropbox Inc. are building
applications for Windows 8, Ballmer said at a conference for
developers at Microsoft''s headquarters in Redmond, Washington.
He said application developers would benefit from their
familiarity with older Windows versions and will be able to
write for mobile phones and tablets. </p>
<p>The world''s largest software maker began selling Windows 8
on Oct. 26. The operating system has been completely redesigned
to work with desktops, laptops and touch-screen tablets as
Microsoft competes with Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG) for the
loyalty of customers who are increasingly shunning PCs and
flocking to mobile devices. Attracting developers to write apps
for Windows will be crucial in capturing sales. </p>
<p>Windows 8 needs a great Twitter app, Twitter said in a
short blog, which was confirmed by the company. So we''re
building it. Looking forward to sharing it with you in the
months ahead. </p>
<p>Downloadable applications have become central to the way
customers use tablet computers, and one of Apple''s selling
points is its leadership in apps. Google said yesterday it has
matched the 700,000 apps that Apple offers on its online store. </p>
<p>Walt Disney Co., ESPN and Lego A/S are also developing
applications for Windows 8, Microsoft said. The software maker
also showed how developers could set up payment systems in their
apps from either PayPal or Microsoft. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) increased its stock repurchase fund by 75 percent to $11.7
billion and said it plans to ask the board to authorize more in
April as it seeks to improve shareholder returns. </p>
<p>The company may buy shares in the open market or in private
transactions, according to a statement today. Armonk, New York-
based IBM spent more than $3 billion on share repurchases in
each of the first two quarters of this year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty is using record
income this year from the company''s shift to more profitable
software and services to reward shareholders whose stock has
been outpaced by the broader market. While the Standard  Poor''s
500 index has increased at more than double the rate of IBM
shares this year, the company''s total return including dividends
and buybacks is 14 percent, compared with 16 percent for the SP
500. </p>
<p>IBM rose 0.9 percent to $193.27 on Oct. 26, the most recent
trading day. The stock market has been closed since yesterday
because of superstorm Sandy. The shares have climbed 5.1 percent
this year, compared with a 12 percent gain for the SP 500. </p>
<p>IBM is projected to record net income of $17 billion this
year, up 7 percent from 2011, according to the average of
analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The board also declared a quarterly dividend of 85 cents a

<p>Guests on two Walt Disney Co. (DIS)
cruises reported being rocked as Hurricane Sandy traveled north
along the coast of Florida Oct. 26 and 27. </p>
<p>A video at CNN.com showed broken glass, gift shop
merchandise on the floor and a ship official warning passengers
to stay in their cabins as the Disney Fantasy was returning to
Port Canaveral, Florida, from a seven-day Caribbean cruise. </p>
<p>On the Disney Dream, passengers who booked a three-day
Bahamas trip instead spent their time coping with rough seas,
according to postings on Disneycruiselineblog.com, which isn''t
affiliated with the company. </p>
<p>The cruise on the Dream was horrible, a passenger who
identified herself as Laurie Eshelman said on the blog. Rather
than stay in the Gulf of Mexico where it would have been calm
and sunny we followed Hurricane Sandy in very rough, rainy seas
with winds up to 83 m.p.h. Passengers were vomiting in the
shops, stairways and theater. Disney you blew this one! </p>
<p>Angela Bliss, a spokeswoman for the Burbank, California-
based Disney, said in an e-mailed there were no reports of
injuries. Minor damage didn''t prevent the ships from embarking
again on their current itineraries, she said. Both ships are in
the Bahamas, according to Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>The passengers who were in the storm were offered 25
percent discounts on future bookings, according to Bliss. The
company and crews were monitoring weather conditions and in
touch with U.S. Coast Guard officials at the time, she said. </p>
<p>Safety is our top priority, Bliss said. At Disney
Cruise Line, our captains and crew members are highly trained
and experienced in navigating through inclement weather. </p>
<p>Disney closed at $50.08 on Oct. 26, down 0.4 percent.

<p>Visa Inc. (V), the world''s biggest
payments network, posted a fiscal fourth-quarter profit that
beat analysts'' estimates as the company reversed $627 million in
previously recorded tax reserves. </p>
<p>Net income for the three months ended Sept. 30 climbed 89
percent to $1.66 billion, or $2.47 a share, from $880 million,
or $1.27, a year earlier, the Foster City, California-based
company said today in a statement. Adjusted profit per share,
which excludes one-time items, was $1.54, beating the $1.50
average estimate of 34 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Adjusted
net income for the full year was $4.2 billion. </p>
<p>Consumer spending in the U.S., where Visa gets more than
half its revenue, rose more than forecast last month, a sign
that the biggest part of the economy was strengthening as the
quarter ended. It was Visa''s last full period under the
stewardship of Chief Executive Officer Joseph W. Saunders, 66,
who steps down after today and hands control to Charles Scharf,
the former head of retail banking at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) </p>
<p>Visa has a strong foundation for continued long-term
growth as technology-enabled change continues to shape our
global market, Saunders said in the statement. We see
extraordinary opportunity for growth. </p>
<h2>Visa''s Outlook </h2>
<p>Visa said annual earnings-per-share growth would be in the
high teens in 2013, down from a 2012 forecast of low
twenties provided in July, according to the statement. The
company said client incentives could climb to 18.5 percent of
gross revenues in 2013, compared with an earlier top range of 18
percent. Capital expenditures may climb to $475 million, up from
an estimate of $400 million, Visa said. </p>
<p>Visa rose 1.2 percent to $140.51 at 4:38 p.m. in New York
after the announcement. It has climbed 37 percent this year, the
sixth-best performance in the 70-company Standard  Poor''s 500
Information Technology Index. MasterCard Inc. (MA) rose 1.8 percent
to $460.93. </p>
<p>The company is working to derive more than half of its
revenue from outside the U.S. by 2015, Saunders has said.
Scharf, 47, may attain that goal with the help of a long-term
global consumer shift to electronic payments from cash and
checks, particularly in emerging economies. </p>
<p>Saunders, who led Visa since its 2008 initial public
offering, will remain as executive chairman through March. He
navigated challenges to the firm''s business model, including new
U.S. rules on debit-card fees that eroded the company''s
dominance of that business as it lost market share to MasterCard
and other competitors. </p>
<h2>MasterCard Results </h2>
<p>MasterCard''s third-quarter profit climbed 7.7 percent to
$772 million, the Purchase, New York-based company said today in
a statement. </p>
<p>Visa''s operating revenue rose 15 percent to $2.73 billion
from a year earlier, beating the $2.67 billion estimate of 31
analysts. </p>
<p>Visa has repurchased stock and increased the dividend as
the company moves closer to resolving a seven-year legal battle
with merchants over credit-card swipe fees. </p>
<p>The settlement of the proposed class-action lawsuit against
banks, MasterCard and Visa probably is worthy of preliminary
approval, U.S. District Judge John Gleeson in Brooklyn, New
York, said last week. Visa has said its share of the settlement
would be about $4.4 billion. MasterCard has said the accord
could cost the company $790 million. </p>
<h2>Processed Transactions </h2>
<p>MasterCard, ranked No. 2 globally by processed
transactions, risks losing its standing as the second-biggest
payments network in terms of total spending to Shanghai-based
China UnionPay Data Co. </p>
<p>UnionPay''s share of combined credit- and debit-card
purchase volume for the first half of 2012 rose to 25 percent
from 21 percent a year earlier, while MasterCard''s climbed to 22
percent from 21 percent, according to the Nilson Report, a
payments-industry newsletter. Visa''s share declined to 46
percent from 49 percent, while fourth-ranked American Express
Co. (AXP)''s fell to 7.2 percent from 7.5 percent. </p>
<p>Visa, MasterCard and New York-based AmEx were among
companies to win partial support this year from World Trade
Organization judges in a U.S. claim that China unfairly
discriminates against foreign suppliers of electronic-payment
services by imposing requirements on them that aren''t applied to
domestic firms. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Citigroup
Inc. (C), the largest and third-largest U.S. banks by assets, opened
about half their retail branches in New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut following the biggest Atlantic storm in history. </p>
<p>Almost 60 percent of JPMorgan''s 3,200 cash machines and 70
percent of Citigroup''s 1,500 ATMs are working today, the New
York-based banks said. JPMorgan is waiving late fees and other
charges for customers in 10 states along the East Coast and the
District of Columbia through Nov. 1, the lender said in a
statement. Citigroup said it is waiving similar charges through
Nov. 5. </p>
<p>Our employees have done simply heroic things to get more
than half of our branches open today, said Ryan McInerney,
chief executive officer of Chase''s consumer bank. We stand
ready to help our customers in any way we can, including
charging mobile phones, he said. </p>
<p>Financial markets were shut for two days, airports were
dark and government offices shuttered by a storm that killed at
least 50 people and disrupted millions of lives because of
flooding and power failures. JPMorgan opened 587 branches, or 55
percent of its retail locations in the region. About 55 percent
of Citigroup''s 300 branches in the area are open, said Catherine Pulley, a spokeswoman for the bank. </p>
<p>Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the second biggest U.S. lender, said
it was deploying mobile ATMs to serve customers in lower
Manhattan and that it had 13 banking centers open in the
borough. About 75 percent of its branches were open in the
Northeast, according to Mark Pipitone, a spokesman for the
Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender. </p>
<p>Citigroup said it is refunding fees for customers who need
to use ATMs outside the bank''s network. </p>
<p>We realize it''s important during this time to have easy
access to cash, said Cece Stewart, president of U.S. consumer
and commercial banking for Citigroup. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS), which agreed to its
biggest takeover in almost seven years, is betting $4.05 billion
that Star Wars is more valuable with Iron Man and Thor than
it was under George Lucas''s control. </p>
<p>The announced price for Lucasfilm Ltd. is larger than every
Disney purchase since Pixar in 2006, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. If the new Star Wars trilogy starting in 2015
matches the films released between 1999 and 2005, Disney is
adding the inflation-adjusted equivalent of three Avengers,
its 2012 movie that won about $1.5 billion in ticket sales. </p>
<p>Disney can squeeze more value out of the 35-year-old movie
series than any other entertainment company because of its
consumer-products business, which delivered $3 billion of sales
in 2011, and film-inspired amusement park rides, said Wunderlich
Securities Inc. The chance to boost sales outside the U.S. makes
the deal even more attractive for Disney shareholders than
Marvel Entertainment Inc., the 2010 purchase that yielded The
Avengers, the third-highest-grossing film of all time, Lazard
Capital Markets LLC said. </p>
<p>It will take some time to see the payoff here, but
Disney''s not managing their stock price for tomorrow or the next
day, David Miller, a Los Angeles-based analyst at Caris  Co.,
said in a telephone interview. Though Disney shares retreated
1.9 percent following the deal''s announcement, what the
Street''s missing here is the supplier power that Disney now has.
It makes sense strategically. </p>
<p>Disney shares rebounded today, rising 1.3 percent to
$49.78. </p>
<p>This is a value-creating acquisition, Jay Rasulo, the
chief financial officer of Burbank, California-based Disney,
said in an Oct. 30 phone interview. </p>
<h2>Joining Forces'' </h2>
<p>We fully expect that by joining forces with Disney,
Lucasfilm will succeed in ways far beyond anything the company
has ever experienced, Lynne Hale, a spokeswoman for Lucasfilm,
wrote in an e-mail. Disney affords us endless new
opportunities. </p>
<p>Lucas, who is Lucasfilm''s only owner, will get half the
purchase price in cash and the rest in Disney stock, according
to an Oct. 30 statement, which also announced that a new Star
Wars trilogy will start coming out in 2015. While Lucasfilm
owns other assets such as the Indiana Jones movies, Disney
said it valued the deal almost entirely based on Star Wars. </p>
<p>The transaction furthers Disney Chief Executive Officer
Robert Iger''s pursuit of marquee content in an era marked by
technology changes, such as $8-a-month video streaming and free
game downloads, that disrupted Hollywood''s traditional revenue
sources. Iger, who paid a combined $11.2 billion for Pixar and
Marvel, said memorable characters will be valuable no matter
what medium they appear in. </p>
<h2>Inflation, 3-D </h2>
<p>Technology has proved more friend than foe to great
storytelling, Iger said in an Oct. 30 phone interview. It
allows us to distribute in ways we never thought would have been
imaginable. </p>
<p>If released today, the last three Star Wars films would
have each generated $1.5 billion on average when adjusting for
inflation, the expanded movie market outside the U.S. and
increased popularity of 3-D releases, Disney said. Sales of
related merchandise will total about $215 million this year, and
Lucasfilm earned $550 million in operating profit in 2005, when
the last movie, Revenge of the Sith, came out, Disney said
in its statement. </p>
<p>Wunderlich''s Matthew Harrigan estimates that if Disney
earns $800 million for each new Star Wars film and $250
million in the years one isn''t released, Lucasfilm''s value is
$5.2 billion, or more than $1 billion greater than what Disney
is paying. Should the next movie only match Lucasfilm''s profit
in 2005 when Revenge of the Sith was released, the business
is worth $3.5 billion, he wrote in a note to clients yesterday. </p>
<h2>Worth More </h2>
<p>The $5.2 billion number frankly could be low if they can
do the magic, Denver-based Harrigan said in a phone interview.
The $4 billion they''re paying is a pretty attractive price and
a lot of the Star Wars'' movies are going to be bigger than a
lot of the Marvel movies. </p>
<p>Evercore Partners Inc. says Lucasfilm''s peak earnings today
would be $600 million to $700 million, including royalty and
licensing profits. That implies Disney is paying 5.5 to 6 times
earnings, which is a reasonable multiple, Evercore analyst
Alan Gould said in a note to clients yesterday. </p>
<p>It''s a pretty full price, Brett Harriss, an analyst
with Gabelli  Co. in Rye, New York, said in a phone interview.
But if they can go out there and put out a successful third
trilogy of Star Wars,'' you could see this deal making sense. </p>
<h2>Finding Nemo'' </h2>
<p>Disney agreed to buy animation studio Pixar, which created
Toy Story and Finding Nemo, in January 2006 and Marvel
in August 2009. Lucasfilm is the biggest deal since Pixar, based
on the size of the transactions when they were announced, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The Pixar purchase, initially valued
at $5.8 billion, increased to $7 billion by closing, and Marvel
expanded to $4.2 billion from $3.8 billion, the data show. The
figures fluctuated because both deals included stock. </p>
<p>Iger is reinventing Disney''s film business through
acquisitions of popular animated and live-action characters.
Marvel''s The Avengers, the first film from that acquisition
to be marketed by Disney, generated $1.51 billion in ticket
sales, trailing only Titanic and Avatar, according to
Box Office Mojo. The picture, Disney''s biggest ever, led to a 24
percent jump in profit in the quarter ended June 30. The
purchase also added characters such as Iron Man and Thor to the
company''s lineup. </p>
<p>Marvel and Pixar reinvigorated Disney''s film business, said
Martin Pyykkonen, an analyst at Wedge Partners Corp. </p>
<h2>The Duds'' </h2>
<p>Some of the best movies they''ve put out are Pixar and
Marvel, and more of the duds have come from their own home-grown
studio, he said in a phone interview. </p>
<p>Disney, with its merchandising business, theme parks and
global presence, can revive and grow the Star Wars franchise
more easily than Lucasfilm could on its own, said Wunderlich''s
Harrigan. </p>
<p>Disney''s consumer-products division, which includes movie-
branded apparel and toys for kids, drew $3.05 billion in revenue
last year, while the company''s parks and resorts accounted for
$11.8 billion, almost a third of total sales, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The top eight amusement parks worldwide by 2011
attendance belonged to Disney, according to an annual report
from the Themed Entertainment Association and consulting firm
Aecom. </p>
<p>There''s no one else who could extract as much value from
Star Wars'' as Disney, Harrigan said in a phone interview.
On the merchandising side, Disney feels they can do a much
better job than Lucasfilm has done as a standalone. </p>
<h2>Drawing Parallels </h2>
<p>While parallels can be drawn between Lucasfilm and Marvel,
the Star Wars owner looks more promising because of the
opportunity to boost non-U.S. revenue, Barton Crockett, a New
York-based analyst with Lazard Capital, wrote in a note to
clients yesterday. </p>
<p>Each year, about a quarter of Disney''s sales are made
outside the U.S. and Canada, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Lucasfilm has sold its products abroad via distribution deals
with third-party agents, which can be cut out under Disney''s
ownership, said Evercore''s Gould, who''s based in New York. </p>
<p>There will be some cost savings by just taking out the
middle man, Gould said in a phone interview. Disney is
already in all those markets and licensing to the same
retailers. It should be very little incremental expense for
Disney to add the Star Wars'' line. </p>
<h2>Retirement Plans </h2>
<p>While Lucas will serve as a creative consultant for the new
movies, Iger said in a conference call with analysts that it''s
his intent to retire. Lucas, 68, said it was time for me to
pass Star Wars'' on to a new generation of filmmakers,
according to the Oct. 30 statement from Disney. </p>
<p>Kathleen Kennedy, co-chairman of Lucasfilm with its
founder, will become president of the unit. She co-founded
Amblin Entertainment with director Steven Spielberg and produced
E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial and Jurassic Park. </p>
<p>The prospect that fresh creative talent will reinvigorate
the franchise has fans excited, according to Paul Dergarabedian,
president of Hollywood.com Box-Office. While the movies released
in the late ''70s and early ''80s won acclaim, the second trilogy
fared worse. When averaging the scores for each movie, 90
percent of reviewers liked the original trilogy, compared with
68 percent for the second batch of films, according to data
compiled by RottenTomatoes.com. </p>
<p>The next movie, known as Episode 7, is scheduled to
come out in 2015, the same year Iger is set to retire as CEO. </p>
<p>There is a huge amount of hope and excitement surrounding
Episode 7,'' that it can kind of go back to what was created
with the first three films, Dergarabedian said in a phone
interview. Injecting new blood into the series with Lucas as
the visionary could prove to be very, very fruitful and
satisfying for the franchise. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world''s
largest energy company by market value, posted net income that
exceeded the highest estimate from analysts as its U.S.
refineries diminished the impact of lower oil output and prices. </p>
<p>Third-quarter profit was $9.57 billion, or $2.09 a share,
down 7.1 percent from $10.3 billion, or $2.13, a year earlier,
Irving, Texas-based Exxon said in a statement today. The per-
share result topped the high estimate of $2.07 and was 13 cents
more than the $1.96 average of 19 analysts'' estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Exxon''s profit from refining oil at U.S. plants soared 78
percent to $1.4 billion, even as the benchmark margin based on
New York futures contracts dropped 5.2 percent. Oil and natural
gas production from Exxon''s wells fell to the lowest in three
years as output slipped everywhere the company operates except
for Africa and Australia, slashing so-called upstream profit by
29 percent to $5.97 billion. </p>
<p>Their upstream performance was light relative to
expectations but that was offset somewhat by strength in their
U.S. refining operations, Jason Gammel, an analyst at
Macquarie Capital Europe Ltd. in London, said in a telephone
interview today. </p>
<h2>Production Decline </h2>
<p>Exxon probably will be forced to lower its full-year 2012
production target after output for the first nine months lagged
the year-earlier volumes by 6.2 percent, Brian Youngberg, an
analyst at Edwards Jones  Co. in St. Louis, said in an
interview today. The company said in March that full-year
production would be 3 percent lower than in 2011, or equivalent
to 4.37 million barrels a day. </p>
<p>Exxon rose 0.5 percent to $91.60 at the close in New York.
Exxon has risen 8.1 percent this year. The shares have 13 buy
recommendations from analysts, 15 holds and zero sell ratings. </p>
<p>Sales fell 7.7 percent to $115.7 billion, a smaller decline
than expected according to the average of three analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Exxon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson
budgeted about $100 million a day this year to find oilfields,
build gas-export terminals and upgrade refineries and chemical
plants. The company agreed to almost $5 billion in acquisitions
in the past six weeks to reverse the longest stretch of
quarterly production declines in 13 years. </p>
<p>Exxon''s production of oil and gas liquids such as butane
declined by 5.9 percent to 2.1 million barrels a day, led by
falling output from European wells, according to the statement.
More than 80 percent of Exxon''s oil and gas-liquids production
comes from outside the U.S. </p>
<h2>Brent Down </h2>
<p>Brent oil futures, the benchmark for two-thirds of the
world''s crude, fell 2.4 percent during the quarter to an average
of $109.42 a barrel as global demand failed to keep pace with
growing supply. </p>
<p>As the biggest U.S. gas producer, Exxon also was stung by a
29 percent plunge in gas prices to an average of $2.893 per
million British thermal units during the quarter. Tillerson said
in June that gas producers have been losing our shirts as
drilling innovations allowed explorers to penetrate North
American shale formations, leading to a supply glut. </p>
<p>Exxon''s gas production declined by 9.3 percent during the
quarter to 11 billion cubic feet a day, according to the
statement. </p>
<h2>World Supplies </h2>
<p>Even as Exxon output was falling, total worldwide crude
output increased by 2.16 million barrels a day during the third
quarter from a year earlier, overwhelming demand that grew by
just 540,000 barrels, according to an Oct. 12 report by the
International Energy Agency. Rising oil usage in major economies
such as China, Japan, India and Russia was insufficient to
offset falling demand in the U.S., the world''s largest crude
market. </p>
<p>Exxon agreed on Sept. 20 to pay about $2 billion in cash
and assets for Denbury Resources Inc. (DNR)''s drilling rights to
196,000 net acres in the Bakken Shale formation beneath North
Dakota and Montana. The transaction will boost Exxon''s holdings
in the region by about 50 percent, the company said at the time. </p>
<p>Last month, Exxon added more shale acreage to its portfolio
with a C$2.86 billion ($2.86 billion) agreement to purchase
Celtic Exploration Ltd. (CLT) The acquisition, Exxon''s largest since
the $35 billion takeover of XTO Energy in June 2010, will
provide access to the Montney and Duvernay formations in western
Canada. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s biggest
drugmaker, narrowed its 2012 forecast after reporting third-
quarter earnings that met analyst estimates and sales that fell
short of expectations. The company also said it was buying back
as much as $10 billion in shares. </p>
<p>Net income in the third quarter fell 14 percent to $3.21
billion, or 43 cents a share, from $3.74 billion, or 48 cents, a
year earlier, New York-based Pfizer said today in a statement.
Earnings excluding one-time items matched the 53 cents average
of 16 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Sales decreased 16 percent to $14 billion, more than $600
million below analyst estimates. The company''s former top seller
Lipitor, in the first full quarter facing competition from
copycat generics, saw sales fall 71 percent to $749 million from
a year earlier. Pfizer has fought to hold on to sales of the
cholesterol pill, using discounts and coupons to keep customers. </p>
<p>We continue to believe that building a pipeline that
delivers sustained revenue and profit growth is the most
enduring driver of multiple growth, said Tony Butler, a drug
industry analyst with Barclays Plc in New York, in an Oct. 15
note to clients. </p>
<p>Analysts had projected third-quarter revenue of $14.7
billion. The sales miss was due to foreign currency exchange
rates that trimmed 4 percent, said Timothy Anderson, an analyst
with Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in New York. In a note to
clients today, he called the buyback program not a surprise. </p>
<h2>Rapamune Charge </h2>
<p>During the quarter, Pfizer also had a $491 million charge
to net income from a settlement with the U.S. Department of
Justice over marketing of Rapamune, a transplant drug, that
Pfizer got with its 2009 purchase of Wyeth. Offsetting that was
$1.1 billion Pfizer got from tax audits in its favor by the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service. </p>
<p>The company narrowed its full year adjusted earnings
forecast to $2.14 to $2.17 a share, from $2.12 to $2.22 a share. </p>
<p>Pfizer also announced a $10 billion share buyback program
once the sale of its nutrition unit to Nestle SA (NESN) for $11.85
billion closes, in the next few months, the company said.
That means that almost the entire proceeds from the nutrition
unit sale will go to buybacks. Pfizer also has $4.1 billion left
in its current repurchase program. </p>
<h2>Share Buybacks </h2>
<p>There''s no defined limit on how far the share buybacks will
extend, said Chief Executive Officer Ian Read. We look at
total shareholder return, through the performance of the
business, dividends and buybacks, he said in a telephone
interview after the announcement. I don''t see it as an ''or,'' I
see it as an ''and,'' he said, comparing buybacks to other
activities. </p>
<p>Pfizer fell 1.3 percent to $24.55 at the 4 p.m. close of
New York trading. The shares have gained 27 percent in the past
12 months. </p>
<p>Our results this quarter reflect continued product losses
of exclusivity, most notably Lipitor in all major markets,
Read said in a statement announcing the results. </p>
<p>Pfizer is divesting its nutrition and animal health units
as part of its plan to refocus the company on developing and
selling new prescription drugs. Its two $2 billion-plus
prospects include a blood thinner, Eliquis, being co-developed
with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY), and a rheumatoid arthritis pill,
tofacitinib. </p>
<p>The animal health business will be spun off in an initial
public offering and stock swap before the first half of next
year. The unit had $4.19 billion in sales last year. </p>
<h2>Last Lever'' </h2>
<p>Once nutritionals and animal health businesses are gone,
Pfizer will revisit further the option of splitting up more,
said Sanford C. Bernstein''s Anderson. This is perhaps the last
major ''lever'' that Pfizer can pull, and doing so would likely
energize investors, he said in a note to clients. </p>
<p>Pfizer has already restructured operations in developed
markets, and is now looking at its business in emerging markets
for more efficiency, Read said. The CEO, however, said today
that though he considers its new drugs and established products
units as separate businesses, he plans no formal separation of
the two. </p>
<p>I haven''t used the word ''separation,'' he said on a
conference call today. I''ve said, ''I see two businesses,'' one
that''s value and one that''s innovative. </p>
<p>Lyrica, used to treat pain, is now Pfizer''s top product.
The pill sold $1.04 billion, up 8 percent from a year earlier.
Other top drugs saw their sales decline. Second best-selling was
Enbrel, for rheumatoid arthritis, which sold $893 million, down
7 percent, partly on foreign exchange rates. Pneumococcal
vaccine Prevnar, which Pfizer is seeking to expand use of in
older populations, sold $868 million, down 14 percent. </p>
<h2>FDA Decision </h2>
<p>The drugmaker is waiting on decisions by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration on tofacitinib, expected by Nov. 21, and
Eliquis, due in March. It is hoping to get both 5-milligram and
10-milligram doses of tofacitinib approved, Geno Germano,
president of specialty care, said on a conference call
discussing the quarterly results. </p>
<p>Tofacitinib could sell $2.16 billion by 2017, according to
the average of three analyst estimates compiled Bloomberg.
Eliquis, meanwhile, could generate $5.2 billion in sales by
2020, which will be split with Bristol-Myers, Catherine Arnold,
an analyst with Credit Suisse Group AG, said in a note to
clients. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) lost a bid
to avoid trial in a lawsuit over the 2000 sale of Dragon Systems
Inc., a pioneer in voice-recognition software, to a Belgian
competitor that collapsed following an accounting scandal. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Patti Saris in Boston yesterday
declined Goldman Sachs''s request to throw out claims by James
and Janet Baker, Dragon System''s founders, that Goldman Sachs
failed to provide adequate advice in the sale of their $600
million company for stock in Lernout  Hauspie Speech Products
NV. Goldman Sachs was paid $5 million for advising Dragon. </p>
<p>The Bakers, who owned 51 percent of Dragon Systems at the
time of the transaction, claim they lost about $300 million and
the rights to patents they developed as voice-recognition
researchers, when Lernout  Hauspie failed months after it was
sold. The Belgian company filed for bankruptcy protection in
November 2000 after public disclosure of improper accounting
forced it to restate $373 million in earnings. </p>
<p>The Bakers claim Goldman should have warned Dragon about
deficiencies in Lernout  Hauspie''s accounting. Saris''s ruling
yesterday clears the way for a trial in the case, which is set
to begin Dec. 10. </p>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said that
Lernout  Hauspie created bogus customers, booked circular
transactions with shell companies and recorded loans as sales
from 1996 to 2000. </p>
<p>The court has denied all of Goldman Sachs''s efforts to
prevent a trial, said Alan Cotler, the Bakers'' lawyer. </p>
<p>Michael DuVally, a Goldman spokesman, declined to comment
on the ruling. </p>
<p>The case is Baker v. Goldman Sachs  Co., 09-cv-10053, U.S.
District Court, District of Massachusetts (Boston). </p>

<p>In any kind of normal flood, water would never reach 80 Pine St., a 39-story tower two blocks inland from the lower Manhattan waterfront, landlord William Rudin said. </p> <p>Last night, his Rudin Management Co. was pumping out the basement, and he was grateful his building manager and engineer weren''t seriously hurt when water poured in as they were shutting down steam lines and checking equipment. </p> <p>They were in a very precarious position on Monday night, Rudin said in a telephone interview. They''re lucky they''re alive. Quick thinking by a couple of their associates saved their lives. So we''re very thankful. </p> <p>Now owners such as Rudin are dealing with the aftermath of the Atlantic storm Sandy, which triggered flooding on Oct. 29 that was anything but normal in lower Manhattan and may have put some buildings that are home to Wall Street firms out of commission for weeks. Landlords are draining basements and determining what it will take to get vital systems for electricity and steam back in service. Among the companies facing possible delays returning to their offices are Morgan Stanley and American International Group Inc. (AIG) </p> <p>The tower at 80 Pine is one of two of Rudin''s buildings that flooded, he said. The other is 110 Wall St. Tenants at 80 Pine include law firm Cahill Gordon  Reindel LLP, and Tullett Prebon Americas Corp., a unit of the London-based inter-broker dealer, according to data from CoStar Group Inc. (CSGP), a Washington-based firm that tracks commercial-property leasing. </p> <h2>Water Street </h2> <p>Tenants at 110 Wall include First Investors Management Co., which offers mutual funds and other financial products, and M.R. Beal  Co., an investment bank. </p> <p>Depending on the systems affected, we''re talking weeks, not days, said Jim Rosenbluth, managing director for crisis management at Cushman  Wakefield Inc., which manages about 15 million square feet (1.4 million square meters) of properties in downtown Manhattan. My assessment is those buildings can''t be used, because you have to have all the basic building services up and running to make the building habitable. </p> <p>Buildings along or near Water Street, which runs from Battery Park on the lower end of the island past Wall Street to Fulton Street, bore the brunt of the record 14-foot (4.3-meter) surge that inundated lower Manhattan in Monday''s storm, Rosenbluth said. Many large financial firms have offices in that area. </p> <h2>AIG Headquarters </h2> <p>The building at 180 Maiden Lane, which houses AIG''s headquarters, suffered heavy flooding, co-landlord SL Green Realty Corp. (SLG) said yesterday in a statement. Engineers and other workers are removing water and seeking to restore operating systems as soon as they can, the company said. </p> <p>That 1.1 million-square-foot building is just across the FDR Drive from the East River, a block east of 80 Pine. </p> <p>Rick Matthews, a spokesman for New York-based SL Green, wouldn''t comment beyond the statement. Jim Ankner, an AIG spokesman, said the company had initiated business continuity plans so it can serve customers. </p> <p>The water must be pumped out before the damage to building equipment can be assessed, Rosenbluth said, speaking in general. Cushman doesn''t service 180 Maiden. </p> <p>Once that is done, and a visual assessment can be made, obviously everything has to be washed down to get the salt off, and then those spaces have to be dried out, he said. And then a comprehensive assessment of the electric and mechanical systems in those buildings has to be done. </p> <h2>Department Determination </h2> <p>The city Department of Buildings will determine when the buildings can reopen, Rosenbluth said. Calls and e-mails to Tony Sclafani, a department spokesman, weren''t returned. </p> <p>The department will be inspecting all structures throughout the city that lie in Zone A, its designation for the areas most vulnerable to flood, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said at a press conference yesterday. Safe buildings will get a green tag, those that are partially safe will be assigned a yellow tag and structures not ready for occupancy will get a red tag. Large building owners can self-certify if city engineers approve, the mayor said. </p> <p>The mayor is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News. </p> <h2>Morgan Stanley </h2> <p>Workers at Morgan Stanley''s offices at 1 New York Plaza are waiting to hear when they can return, a person with knowledge of the situation said. The company may face an extended absence there because salt water got into the basement where operating systems are located, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. </p> <p>Employees from 1 New York Plaza are working at other offices, including Morgan Stanley (MS)''s headquarters in Times Square, which is fully operational, or are using computers remotely, said Matt Burkhard, a spokesman for the company. </p> <p>Brookfield Office Properties (BPO), which owns the 2.6 million-square-foot skyscraper near the foot of Manhattan, said in a statement that flooding took place in the building''s sub-levels. </p> <p>Water removal is substantially under way, and Brookfield is taking all necessary steps to bring 1 New York Plaza online as quickly as possible, the company said in a statement e-mailed by Andrew Willis, a spokesman for Brookfield''s parent company, Toronto-based Brookfield Asset Management Inc. (BAM/A) </p> <p>Brookfield is lower Manhattan''s largest office landlord. </p> <h2>Collateral Damage'' </h2> <p>The 8 million-square-foot World Financial Center, the company''s largest New York property, suffered only limited collateral damage, according to the statement. Power has already been restored at the four-building complex, which sits by the Hudson River, the company said. </p> <p>At the World Trade Center site, water got into the lowest sub-basement of 4 World Trade Center, said a person with knowledge of that property, which is under construction by Silverstein Properties Inc. The building''s mechanical equipment wasn''t damaged because they are on a level above the sub-basement, which is 80 feet below the street, said the person, who declined to be identified because the information is private. </p> <p>Removal of the water is well under way, Silverstein Properties said in a statement e-mailed by spokesman Bud Perrone. Four World Trade remains on track for completion next year, the company said. </p> <h2>Rethink'' Buildings </h2> <p>Repairing damaged buildings in lower Manhattan won''t simply be a matter of putting everything back where it was, Rudin said today in an interview on Bloomberg Television''s In the Loop with Betty Liu. </p> <p>We''re going to have to rethink how these buildings get rebuilt, he said. Put the power up higher, have more robust emergency generators. I think the governor and the mayor have already talked about that, and I think that''s an important step. </p> <p>Today''s lifting of a moratorium on exterior construction, which the mayor imposed on Friday because of high winds, should expedite the recovery, Rudin said. </p> <p>In a city where 6,300 people remained in shelters as of yesterday and subway service to lower Manhattan remains suspended, getting downtown''s towers back in service is a priority competing with others, said Thomas Scarangello, chief executive officer of Thornton Tomasetti Inc., an engineering firm which is helping landlords and insurers assess the damage. </p> <p>Everyone understands the enormity and the basic challenges, he said. Till the water''s gone and you see the issues that have to be addressed, it''s hard to put a timeline on any of it. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Sarika Gangar and Charles Mead" date="Nov 02, 2012  5:56 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-02/microsoft-leads-10-3-billion-of-sales-in-year-s-busiest-friday.html"><headline>Bond Sales in U.S. Reach $15.1 Billion in Year''s Busiest Friday</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Verizon
Communications Inc. (VZ) led borrowers in the U.S. selling $15.1
billion of bonds in the busiest Friday this year as issuers
stymied by Hurricane Sandy try to complete deals before the U.S.
presidential election. </p>
<p>Microsoft, the world''s largest software maker, sold $2.25
billion of securities in three parts and New York-based Verizon
raised $4.5 billion in its first bond sale this year, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales exceed this year''s daily
average of $6.1 billion and compare with $2.9 billion on Oct.
26. </p>
<p>Issuers rushed to market at the end of a week shortened by
a virtual three-day hiatus amid the biggest Atlantic storm in
history. As electricity and mass transit are gradually restored,
issuers looked to lock in record-low borrowing costs after
today''s better-than-expected jobs report and before next week''s
presidential elections, according to Jody Lurie at Janney
Montgomery Scott LLC. </p>
<p>This is a very one-time, unusual event, Lurie, a
Philadelphia-based corporate credit analyst, said in a telephone
interview. The unemployment figures are giving borrowers a
green light to say, OK, go time, don''t wait,'' she said. </p>
<p>Yields on U.S. corporate bonds reached a record-low 3.58
percent on Oct. 19 before increasing to 3.62 percent yesterday,
according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate 
High Yield Master index. The extra yield investors demand to own
corporate bonds rather than government debentures rose to 231
basis points from 227 basis points on Oct. 26. </p>
<h2>Microsoft Offering </h2>
<p>Microsoft, the manufacturer of the Windows operating
system, sold $600 million of 0.875 percent, five-year notes at a
relative yield of 27 basis points, $750 million of 2.125
percent, 10-year securities at a spread of 47 basis points and
$900 million of 3.5 percent, 30-year debt at 67 basis points as
soon as today, Bloomberg data show. The Redmond, Washington-
based company''s bonds are rated Aaa, the highest level of
investment grade, by Moody''s Investors Service, the ratings
company said today in a statement. </p>
<p>Verizon, the second-largest U.S. phone company, raised $1
billion of 0.7 percent, three-year notes at a spread of 32 basis
points; $500 million of 1.1 percent, five-year debt at 42 basis
points; $1.75 billion of 2.45 percent, 10-year securities at 75
basis points; and $1.25 billion of 3.85 percent, 30-year debt at
97 basis points, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<h2>Verizon Issue </h2>
<p>The company last issued debt in October 2011 and proceeds
will be used to pay existing debt and for general corporate
purposes, the person said. </p>
<p>Following the Oct. 29 storm, power had been restored to 4.6
million customers as of yesterday, or about 45 percent of those
affected, according to the U.S. Energy Department. The outages
pose a real, serious threat of disruption to voting on Nov.
6 in Nassau County, New York''s largest suburban jurisdiction,
said William Biamonte, the county Democratic election
commissioner. </p>
<p>A Washington Post/ABC News national tracking poll released
yesterday showed presidential candidates Barack Obama and Mitt Romney essentially tied, with 49 percent of likely voters
supporting Obama and 48 percent with Romney. </p>
<p>In the last jobs report before next week''s election, a net
171,000 workers were added to payrolls in October after a
148,000 gain in September that was more than first estimated,
Labor Department figures showed today in Washington. The
increase exceeded the most optimistic forecast in a Bloomberg
survey in which the median called for an advance of 125,000. The
unemployment rate rose to 7.9 percent from 7.8 percent. </p>
<h2>Accelerating Funding </h2>
<p>Companies are trying to take advantage of the current
low-rate environment, in case there is a shift in the yield
curve after the elections, Alan Shepard, an analyst at
Madison, Wisconsin-based Madison Investment Holdings Inc., which
oversees about $16 billion, wrote in an e-mail. For firms in
need of financing, they may be accelerating their funding to
get it in now, in an environment that is known, rather than do
the funding at a potentially higher cost in a more uncertain
environment post-election, he said. </p>
<p>Aetna Inc. (AET), the third-biggest U.S. health insurer, sold $2
billion of debt split into $500 million of 1.5 percent, five-
year notes at a spread of 88 basis points, $1 billion of 2.75
percent, 10-year securities at 123 basis points and $500 million
of 4.125 percent, 30-year debt at 133 basis points, Bloomberg
data show. Proceeds will be used to help finance the company''s
purchase of Coventry Health Care Inc. </p>
<h2>Clear Channel </h2>
<p>In addition to today''s sales, Clear Channel Communications
Inc. plans to raise $2.73 billion next week through a unit of
its Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings business, the San Antonio-
based company said today in a statement. Proceeds will fund a
tender offer for as much as $2.5 billion of shorter-term
securities. </p>
<p>Clear Channel Worldwide, which manages advertising
displays, will offer about $736 million of 10-year series A
senior notes and about $2 billion of similar-maturity series B
bonds. Pricing is set for Nov. 5, according to a person familiar
with the transaction who asked not to be identified because the
terms are private. </p>

by flooding and power failures, the company said today in a
statement on its website. Amounts ranging from $5,000 to $25,000
will be available within five to seven days after application. </p>
<p>Many small businesses in our communities have been
devastated by this disaster, and fast access to capital will
help them get back on their feet more quickly, Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 58, said in the statement. </p>
<p>The money from the city and Goldman Sachs''s Urban
Investment Group will be available through the New York Business

Television''s Market Makers with Erik Schatzker and Stephanie Ruhle on Oct. 30. </p>
<p>We clearly feel an obligation and a responsibility to the
neighborhood and the people that live there, said Cohn, 52. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-biggest
U.S. energy company by market value, said third-quarter profit
declined as output plunged to a 4-year low, oil prices slumped
and refining income dropped 65 percent. </p>
<p>Net income was $5.25 billion, or $2.69 a share, compared
with $7.83 billion, or $3.92, a year earlier, San Ramon,
California-based Chevron said in a statement today. Per-share
results were 15 cents less than the $2.84 average of 19
analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Oil and natural gas production from Chevron''s wells dropped
to the lowest since the third quarter of 2008 after Hurricane
Isaac shut output in the Gulf of Mexico and oilfield repairs
were conducted in Kazakhstan and the U.K. Isaac also forced the
shutdown of Chevron''s largest refinery in Pascagoula,
Mississippi, and a fire damaged the company''s San Francisco-area
plant. </p>
<p>Chevron''s fuel-production profit fell by $1.3 billion to
$689 million because of the plant outages and declining fuel
margins. The U.S. margin for processing oil into gasoline and
diesel fell 5.2 percent to an average of $30.86 per barrel
during the quarter, based on benchmark futures contracts traded
in New York. </p>
<p>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Watson is
spending almost $90 million a day this year to expand the search
for untapped reserves from the Indian Ocean to the Baltic Sea.
The company is aiming to raise production by one-fifth by the
end of 2017 to the equivalent of 3.3 million barrels of crude. </p>
<h2>Energy Prices </h2>
<p>The earnings statement was released before the opening of
regular U.S. stock trading. Chevron rose 1.1 percent yesterday
to $111.46 at the close in New York. Sales fell 9.9 percent to
$58.04 billion. </p>
<p>Profit from oil and gas wells declined by 17 percent to
$5.14 billion as output fell to the equivalent of 2.52 million
barrels of crude a day from 2.6 million a year earlier,
according to the statement. </p>
<p>Brent crude futures, the benchmark for two-thirds of the
world''s oil, fell 2.4 percent during the quarter to an average
of $109.42 a barrel. Worldwide crude output rose by 2.16 million
barrels a day during the third quarter from a year earlier, four
times faster than the 540,000-barrel-a-day increase in demand,
according to an Oct. 12 report by the International Energy
Agency. </p>
<p>Chevron''s performance also was diminished by a 29 percent
decline in U.S. gas prices from a year earlier to an average of
$2.893 per million British thermal units during the quarter.
Horizontal wells and hydraulic fracturing have allowed explorers
to penetrate gas-rich shale formations in the U.S. Great Plains,
Appalachia and western Canada, leading to a North American
supply glut. </p>
<p>Chevron has risen 4.7 percent this year, outperforming the
1.8 percent increase in Brent crude futures. The shares have 20
buy recommendations from analysts, eight holds and one sell
rating. </p>
