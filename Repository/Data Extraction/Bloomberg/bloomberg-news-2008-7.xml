<p>Morgans Hotel Group Co. (MHGC) and Orient-Express Hotels Ltd. (OEH) fell at least 7.5 percent in U.S. trading
after having their ratings cut to ''''underperform'''' at Merrill
Lynch  Co. because of a slowdown in demand for U.S. lodging. </p>
<p>''''We remain cautious on the group as we expect occupancy to
decline further before reaching trough levels,'''' New York-based
analyst Amanda Bryant wrote in a note today. Previously, Bryant
advised investors to hold both stocks. </p>
<p>Morgans Hotel Group, based in New York, lost 82 cents to
$10.19 at 11:44 a.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading.
Bermuda-based Orient-Express Hotels, the owner of more than 40
properties, dropped $3.12 to $38.63 on the New York Stock
Exchange. </p>
<p>Separately, Orient-Express will own 50 percent of three
hotels being built by U.S. real-estate developer Related Group
under a new partnership, Orient-Express spokeswoman Pippa Isbell
said today in a telephone interview from London. </p>
<p>The companies will build and run hotels and residences in
Florida''s South Beach region of Miami; Cartagena, Colombia; and
Panama City, Panama, which are set to open in three years,
according to Orient-Express. Orient-Express and Related Group
intend to collaborate on more joint projects, Isbell added. </p>
