<p>Banks struggling to find buyers for
$131 billion of unsold loans that financed last year''s leveraged
buyouts are starting to break ranks and hold individual
negotiations with investors. </p>
<p>Instead of sticking together in a lending group, or
syndicate, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Morgan Stanley (MS) and
Credit Suisse Group have each sought buyers for their portion of
Clear Channel Communications Inc. (CCU)''s $22 billion buyout
financing, said people with knowledge of the situation. They
declined to be identified because the talks are private. </p>
<p>Banks are under pressure to sell the loans after prices for
debt that paid for last year''s record $438 billion of buyouts
fell 12 percent in the past seven months, according to Standard
 Poor''s. Banks and securities firms have taken about $188
billion in writedowns and credit losses since the beginning of
2007, including reserves for bad loans, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>''''It''s reached a new stage of every man for himself,''''
Martin Fridson, chief executive officer of high-yield research
firm FridsonVision LLC in New York, said in an interview.
''''Banks worked hard until now to hold the line and keep the
gentlemen''s agreement together.'''' </p>
<p>Jennifer Sala, a spokeswoman for New York-based Morgan
Stanley, declined comment. Peter Ward, a spokesman for RBS,
based in Edinburgh, didn''t return calls seeking comment. Zurich-based Credit Suisse hasn''t sold any of the Clear Channel debt
and plans to work with the syndicate, Tom Newberry, the bank''s
global head of syndicated loans in New York, said in a telephone
interview. </p>
<p>`Circled the Wagons'' </p>
<p>New York-based Citigroup Inc. (C) is leading the group. The
other banks include Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) of Frankfurt and Wachovia
Corp. (WB) in Charlotte, North Carolina. </p>
<p>Credit Suisse, Switzerland''s second-biggest bank, sold its
share of $7.25 billion of loans to Las Vegas-based casino
operator Harrah''s Entertainment Inc. in December, before the
other banks, which then struggled to sell the debt, people with
knowledge of the situation said. </p>
<p>''''Up through recently, the banking community kind of
circled wagons and everybody was protecting their positions
because they were involved in the same'''' loans, said Matthew Eagan, a money manager at Boston-based Loomis Sayles  Co.,
which oversees $130 billion of assets. ''''What you didn''t want
was somebody under-pricing you and hurting you.'''' </p>
<p>In syndicated loans, banks form a financing group. One or
two institutions typically take charge in finding buyers for
chunks of the loans, such as other banks, money managers and
hedge funds, at an agreed upon price. </p>
<h2>Buyout Frenzy </h2>
<p>Investor demand for riskier assets including high-yield
loans used to finance buyouts began to dry up in the second half
of last year as losses related to the collapse of the subprime
mortgage market spread. Banks were stuck with $163 billion of
the loans at the beginning of 2008, according to a Bank of
America Corp. report last week. </p>
<p>Financial firms will likely see their credit-related losses
reach at least $600 billion, UBS AG analysts wrote in a report
dated Feb. 29. </p>
<p>Loans trade at an average price of 89.02 cents on the
dollar, down from 100 cents in July, according to SP data.
High-yield, or leveraged, loans are rated below BBB- by SP and
Baa3 by Moody''s Investors Service. </p>
<p>`Steady Decline'' </p>
<p>''''It''s been a reasonably steady decline in market
conditions,'''' Blackstone President Hamilton James said on a
conference call today. The publicly traded buyout firm raised a
$1.4 billion fund to invest in loans stuck on bank balance sheets
last November. The firm still has ''''100 percent dry powder'''' and
expects conditions to get worse before improving, James said. </p>
<p>''''Temptation is growing. Some time in the next 90 days
might be the time to do something significant,'''' he said on a
separate call with investors today. </p>
<p>San Antonio-based Clear Channel, the largest U.S. radio
broadcaster, is being bought for $19.5 billion by private-equity
firms Bain Capital LLC and Thomas H. Lee Partners LP, both
located in Boston. </p>
<p>The banks financing the deal agreed in April to provide $22
billion in debt. Banks will extend about $19.5 billion in bank
loans at the London interbank offered rate plus as much as 3.25
percentage points. The premium over Libor (US0003M) has since widened to
about 6.65 percentage points, according to SP, meaning the
banks must sell the Clear Channel loans at a discount to reflect
the wider spreads and current prices. Three-month Libor was 2.94
percent last week. </p>
<h2>Betrayal </h2>
<p>Clear Channel fell 18 cents to $33.96 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading today. The shares have climbed 18
percent over the past month as more investors bet the deal would
be completed. The buyout firms agreed to pay $39.20 a share. </p>
<p>The decision by the banks to approach investors separately
probably means they will be able to buy the loans cheaper. </p>
<p>''''From an investor viewpoint, they are unlikely to be upset
about banks betraying one another, because investors feel they
were treated shabbily by the banks all through the bull
period,'''' Fridson said. </p>

<p>U.S. banks from Goldman Sachs (GS) Group
Inc. to Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. have whittled their
holdings of leveraged buyout loans to $129 billion from $163
billion at the beginning of the year by offering the debt at
discounts, according to analysts at Bank of America Corp. (BAC) </p>
<p>The decline is a ''''ray of hope'''' for banks amid a slump in
credit markets and a slowing economy, said analysts led by
Jeffrey Rosenberg. The firms also have $73.6 billion of high-yield bonds they need to sell, they said. </p>
<p>Banks have been breaking ranks from their lending groups and
offering their own pieces of the LBO loans at as little as 80
cents on the dollar to get the debt off their books. New York-based Lehman yesterday said it has reduced its LBO backlog by
$6.1 billion to $17.8 billion since the beginning of the year.
Goldman Sachs halved its holdings to $20 billion and Morgan
Stanley (MS) reduced its pipeline by 20 percent. </p>
<p>The buyout industry, including Blackstone Group (BX), Apollo
Management LP and Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts  Co. (KKR), all based in
New York, negotiated more than $370 billion in financing to back
acquisitions such as the $32 billion purchase of Texas power
producer TXU Corp. and the $46.8 billion sale of Canadian
telecommunications company BCE Inc. (BCE) to an investor group led by
the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan, the largest buyout ever. </p>
<h2>Plunging Demand </h2>
<p>Investor demand for the debt plummeted in July as losses on
U.S. subprime securities spread to other asset classes. The
average price of a leveraged loan fell from par to a record low
of 86.28 last month, according to Standard  Poor''s data. Prices
have since climbed to 87.32 cents on the dollar. </p>
<p>Banks began tackling the backlog in September, when lenders
for KKR sold $9.4 billion of loans at a discount of up to 4
percent for its takeover of Greenwood Village, Colorado-based
First Data Corp., the biggest processor of credit card payments. </p>
<p>Goldman, the world''s biggest securities firm by market
value, is selling its portion of Chrysler LLC''s $7 billion in
loans for as little as 72 cents on the dollar, said investors,
who declined to be identified because the terms are private.
Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally declined to comment on
individual sales. </p>
<p>Cerberus Capital Management LP bought Chrysler Group LLC
last August. Bankers for the Auburn Hills, Michigan-based
automaker twice failed to sell the Chrysler loans. JPMorgan Chase
 Co. (JPM), Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Bear Stearns Cos. and Goldman,
all of New York, tried in November to sell $4 billion of the
loans at 97.5 cents on the dollar. </p>
<p>The loan is priced at 400 basis points more than the three-month London interbank offered rate, or Libor (US0003M), a borrowing
benchmark. Three-month Libor is 2.6 percent. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point. </p>
<h2>Backlogs Reduced </h2>
<p>Goldman reduced its backlog of loans by $20 billion in the
past quarter from $43 billion, chief financial officer David Viniar said on an investor call yesterday. The New York-based
firm, which booked a loss of $1 billion on the loans, also added
$4 billion of new commitments during the period. </p>
<p>Lehman, the fourth-biggest U.S. securities firm, booked
losses of $500 million on leveraged loans last quarter, CFO Erin Callan said on a conference call with investors yesterday. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, the second-biggest U.S. securities firm,
reduced its leveraged finance pipeline to $16 billion from $20
billion during the first quarter, CFO Colm Kelleher said in an
interview today after the company reported first-quarter profit
fell 42 percent. </p>
<p>Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Morgan Stanley and Credit
Suisse Group have each sought buyers for their portion of Clear
Channel Communications Inc.''s $22 billion buyout financing, said
people with knowledge of the situation. </p>
<h2>LBO Buyers </h2>
<p>Some of the same LBO firms that generated the debt in the
first place are raising funds to buy it back at reduced prices.
Blackstone raised a $1.4 billion fund last November to buy bank
loans, and Leon Black''s Apollo  has bought $1 billion of
distressed loans and bonds. </p>
<p>''''The leveraged loan forward calendar continues to
decline,'''' Rosenberg wrote in the report on March 17. ''''The
ongoing raising of distressed debt funds,'''' including Apollo''s,
''''appears to support these efforts.'''' </p>
<p>In addition to the buyout firms, traditional loan investors
and hedge funds are also buying the debt. </p>
<p>Dallas-based Highland Capital Management LP has raised $1
billion in the past four months from pension funds and sovereign
wealth funds, to invest in debt, including bank loans, according
to Mark Okada, co-founder and chief investment officer. </p>
<p>''''We are more willing to participate in new issues at these
distressed prices,'''' said Scott D''Orsi, a partner at Boston-based
Feingold O''Keeffe Capital, which has $1.25 billion in assets.
''''It''s been a waiting game between the buy side and the banks
over the past several months, with pricing moving in favor of
investors.'''' </p>

<p>New York paid 10 securities firms
more than $600,000 since mid-February to handle bids for
auction-bonds even though the sales failed, saddling the state
with penalty interest rates. </p>
<p>Citigroup Inc. (C), Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and eight more
firms receive $10 million a year to oversee periodic bidding
that sets rates on about $4 billion of auction bonds. When there
aren''t enough buyers, the yields rise. A total of 188 of the
state''s 201 auctions since Feb. 12 have failed, according to
data supplied by the state. </p>
<p>''''We are contractually obligated to pay these fees
regardless of whether the auction fails, and we will fulfill our
commitment,'''' Matt Anderson, a spokesman for New York''s Division
of Budget said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>State and local governments pay almost $8 million a week in
fees to banks for auctions-rate bonds, based on standard fees.
About two-thirds of auctions in the $330 billion market have
failed since mid-February, including periodic sales of preferred
stock for closed-end bond funds, Bloomberg data show. Securities
firms are receiving the same fee even when investors who wanted
to sell are unable to do so because bankers haven''t found enough
bidders. </p>
<p>`Systemic Problems'' </p>
<p>Banks covered shortfalls in demand at auctions in the $330
billion market buy purchasing bonds for their own account, even
though they weren''t obliged to. They didn''t tell investors or
issuers about the extent of the activity, which was one of the
practices cited by the Securities and Exchange Commission in
2006 when it fined 15 banks a total of $13 million for bid-rigging. </p>
<p>New York isn''t trying to renegotiate the contracts with the
10 broker-dealers it uses for auction bonds, Anderson said. The
firms also include Bank of America Corp., Wachovia Corp., UBS
AG, JPMorgan Chase  Co., Merrill Lynch  Co., Bear Stearns Cos.
Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. </p>
<p>''''These failed auctions were not caused by these banks, but
by systemic problems within this market beyond their control,''''
he said. </p>
<p>A spokeswoman for New York-based Citigroup, Danielle Romero-Apsilos, declined to comment, as did Michael DuVally, a
spokesman for New York-based Goldman. Citigroup was the biggest
underwriter of auction-rate debt from 2000 to 2007, according to
Thomson Financial. Goldman is the most profitable investment
bank. </p>
<h2>Higher Rates </h2>
<p>When there aren''t enough bidders in auctions that typically
take place every seven, 28 or 35 days, rates get set by formulas
spelled out when the debt is issued. In New York, the penalty
rates ranged from 3.59 percent to 5.64 percent in the week ended
March 14. That compares with yields on the variable-rate demand
bonds, an alternative to auction-rate notes, that were less than
3 percent for 27 of 43 issues, according to state data. </p>
<p>Seven-day auction rates averaged 4.36 percent on March 19
for borrowers in New York, New Jersey, California and
Massachusetts, up from 3.47 percent on Feb. 6, the last week
before New York auctions began failing, according to index data
published by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets
Association. The rate peaked at 5.98 percent March 5. </p>
<p>Before the failures, auction-rate bonds were a way to sell
long-term bonds at money market rates. They were the least
expensive kind of borrowing for New York until demand began to
weaken in September, according to a state report. </p>
<h2>Bank Contracts </h2>
<p>Anderson said copies of the contracts with banks handling
the auction bonds weren''t available. Anderson and Ronald
Greenberg, a first deputy director of the budget, said state
officials are in daily contact with bankers about auction bonds.
He declined to respond to questions about the shortage of
bidders since Feb. 12. </p>
<p>''''Contracts for handling auctions are written by broker
dealers and presented to issuers as part of a negotiated
transaction,'''' said Joseph Fichera, chief executive officer of
Saber Partners, a New York based adviser to companies and
governments. ''''They can be terminated or renegotiated, like any
contract.'''' </p>
<p>Fichera, a financial adviser to the New York State
Dormitory Authority, declined to comment on the state''s bonds. </p>
<p>There is precedent for broker-dealer agreements that don''t
pay banks a fee when auctions fail. </p>
<p>After auctions failed to attract enough bidders in 1990 for
bonds of Tucson Electric Power Co., now a unit of Unisource
Energy Corp. (UNS), Fichera arranged a new contract that rewarded
bankers with a higher fee for selling bonds that resulted in a
lower auction rate, and no fee if bonds sold at the highest
permitted rate. </p>
