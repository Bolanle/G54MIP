<p>Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world''s largest
soft-drink maker, will shift some of outgoing marketing chief
Mary Minnick''s responsibilities to recently promoted President
Muhtar Kent. </p>
<p>Kent will oversee marketing for the Atlanta-based company
beginning March 1, Chief Executive Officer Neville Isdell, said
today in an internal memo to employees. Minnick, who was passed
over when Kent was named president and chief operating officer
in December, said last week she will leave in February to pursue
other personal and professional goals in the U.K. </p>
<p>The move gives more responsibility to Kent, 54, who is
Coca-Cola''s second-highest ranking executive and likely
successor to Isdell. Coca-Cola''s strategy and innovation groups,
formerly overseen by Minnick, will report to Isdell. </p>
<p>''''As the health of our business continues to improve, the
factors that necessitated the combining of marketing, strategy
and innovation have evolved,'''' Isdell, 63, said in the memo. </p>
<p>The new structure allows Coca-Cola to ''''increase the impact
and effectiveness of the global marketing community, while
preserving the benefits we have captured'''' by previously
combining the groups, wrote Isdell, who hasn''t said when he
plans to retire. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola also said today Marc Mathieu, who previously
oversaw marketing for brands such as Coca-Cola, Sprite and
Fanta, will assume similar duties for noncarbonated drinks

<p>Coca-Cola Co. (KO) will go head-to-head
with PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) in Super Bowl television advertising for the
first time in almost a decade as it tries to boost sales of its
top-selling drink. </p>
<p>One new ad for Coca-Cola Classic will air during
professional football''s championship game along with two spots
that debuted during the television show ''''American Idol,'''' the
Atlanta-based company said in a statement today. Coca-Cola hasn''t
run promotions during the Super Bowl since 1998. </p>
<p>Advertising during television''s most-watched event pits
Coca-Cola against PepsiCo as both companies try to reverse a drop
in U.S. soda sales. PepsiCo has advertised during the Super Bowl
for 21 consecutive years and will sponsor the half-time show for
the first time. </p>
<p>''''Coke wants back in the game,'''' said Z. John Zhang,
marketing professor at the Wharton School at the University of
Pennsylvania. ''''They''ve waited this many years to come back, so
the pressure is on them to have the louder voice.'''' </p>
<p>Both soft-drink makers are trying to stop declines in the
U.S., where soda consumption dropped in 2005 for the first time
in at least 15 years because of concern that sugary beverages
contribute to obesity. Coca-Cola''s soft drink volume fell 1
percent in North America during the third quarter, and PepsiCo''s
dropped 2 percent. </p>
<h2>Cost of Ads </h2>
<p>Coca-Cola''s Super Bowl advertisements include a 60-second
spot titled ''''Video Game,'''' showing a character who passes out
bottles of Coca-Cola Classic to people he meets on the street.
Coca-Cola will also run a 30-second ad called ''''Happiness
Factory'''' that follows a bottle of Coke through an imaginary
vending machine. </p>
<p>The company won''t say anything about the new commercial
being made for the Super Bowl. The ads were created by
independent agency Wieden + Kennedy, based in Portland, Oregon. </p>
<p>''''Coca-Cola Classic has always been about having fun, and
that''s what people get together to do when they watch the Super
Bowl,'''' said Katie Bayne, senior vice president for Coca-Cola
brands in North America. </p>
<p>Shares of Coca-Cola fell 1 cent to $48.13 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. They gained 20 percent
last year, the biggest gain since 1997. </p>
<p>PepsiCo shares climbed 36 cents to $65.20. They rose 5.9
percent last year. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola spokeswoman Susan McDermott wouldn''t say how much
the company is spending on the game. A 30-second ad during the
Super Bowl can cost $2.5 million, according to AdWeek. Coca-
Cola''s advertising budget was $2.48 billion in 2005. </p>
<h2>Bears vs. Colts </h2>
<p>More than 141 million people watched last year''s Super Bowl.
This year''s game, scheduled for Feb. 4 at Dolphin Stadium in
Miami Gardens, Fla., is a match-up between the Chicago Bears and
the Indianapolis Colts. </p>
<p>The Super Bowl will be broadcast on CBS Corp.''s CBS network.
The television show American Idol, the most popular show on
primetime television, airs on News Corp.''s Fox network. </p>
<p>In addition to the half-time show sponsorship, PepsiCo plans
to run 90 seconds of ads during the first half of the Super Bowl,
spokeswoman Nicole Bradley said. She wouldn''t say how much the
company is spending, or which ads it plans to run. </p>
<p>PepsiCo has a promotion featuring a sterling silver can of
Pepsi studded with diamonds, rubies and sapphires. The company
will give away the can, worth $100,000, and Super Bowl tickets
for life after the half-time show, which includes a performance
by the musician Prince. </p>
<p>''''We thrive on the Super Bowl spotlight. It''s been a part of
our game plan for more than two decades,'''' Bradley said. </p>
<p>Last year, Coca-Cola sponsored a Super Bowl pre-game show
with its Full Throttle energy drink. Ads showed a semi-tractor
trailer truck mounted with an oversized can of Full Throttle
overtaking a small pickup truck with a slender can of rival
energy drink Red Bull. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world''s largest
soft-drink maker, agreed to buy Fuze Beverage LLC to add more
juice, tea and energy drinks in an effort to catch up with
PepsiCo Inc. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola gains a half-dozen new products including Fuze
Tea, NOS energy drinks and Fuze Slenderize, which has chromium
and amino acids that Fuze says help promote weight loss. Atlanta-
based Coca-Cola didn''t disclose terms of the purchase. </p>
<p>Fuze beverages may help Coca-Cola win back customers who
switched from sugary sodas to drinks such as PepsiCo''s SoBe tea.
It''s Coca-Cola''s biggest U.S. acquisition since buying Odwalla
Inc. in 2001 for $186 million to gain protein drinks and juices,
said John Sicher, editor of industry journal Beverage Digest. </p>
<p>''''This represents Coke aggressively getting itself into a
better place in the noncarbonated business in the U.S.,'''' Sicher
said. ''''Fuze is small but growing strongly.'''' </p>
<p>Sicher estimated that Coca-Cola paid $225 million to $250
million for closely held Fuze. He said the Englewood Cliffs, New
Jersey-based company sold about 11.5 million cases last year, up
from 8 million cases in 2005, generating $90 million to $100
million in revenue. </p>
<p>Shares of Coca-Cola rose 22 cents to $48.10 at 4:22 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. They increased 20
percent last year, their biggest gain since 1997. </p>
<h2>Bottlers </h2>
<p>The Fuze purchase may help sate bottlers that had
complained about Coca-Cola falling behind PepsiCo in adding
drinks other than soda. Coca-Cola depends on soda for 80 percent
of its volume, compared with less than 20 percent for PepsiCo. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (CCE), the largest distributor, agreed
to distribute Arizona bottled teas in the U.S. last year, making
good on a promise to get new drinks from someone other than Coca-
Cola if it needed to. The bottler is 36 percent owned by Coca-
Cola. </p>
<p>''''This should be well-received by Coke''s bottlers,'''' Bill Pecoriello, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, wrote today in a note. </p>
<p>Fuze was already distributed by 20 Coca-Cola bottlers
including Coca-Cola Bottling Co. United of Birmingham, Alabama,
and the Philadelphia Coca-Cola Bottling Co. </p>
<p>Only about 15 percent of Fuze''s volume currently goes
through Coca-Cola bottlers, Pecoriello wrote. The Cadbury
Schweppes Bottling Group had distributed Fuze in much of the
U.S., Sicher said. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated, the second-largest
bottler for Coca-Cola, sells Cinnabon bottled coffee and created
a separate unit called Beverages and Beyond Brands to create or
buy drinks it wasn''t getting from the soda maker. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola''s soda volume in the U.S. dropped by a low single
digit in 2005, while noncarbonated volume jumped 10 percent. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Cazenove Ltd. and Bear
Stearns Cos. will help raise up to $2 billion for a Kuwaiti
buyout fund offering international investors a way to tap oil-fueled economic growth in the Middle East and North Africa. </p>
<p>Global Investment House KSCC (GI5B), Kuwait''s biggest investment
bank, will open its Global Buyout Fund to investors tomorrow,
Shailesh Dash, head of the lender''s strategic investment group,
said in a phone interview today from Kuwait. It aims to raise
about $1.5 billion for conventional private equity, and another
$500 million for Islamic investments. </p>
<p>''''This is the first time a Gulf fund has attracted two
international placement agents without giving them a role on
the fund''s management board,'''' Dash said. ''''This region''s
current account surpluses, construction boom and opening
economies are really attracting investors now.'''' </p>
<p>The economy of Saudi Arabia, the world''s biggest oil
producer, will expand by 6.5 percent this year as the
government spends oil surpluses on new infrastructure, the
International Monetary Fund forecasts. Economic growth in Egypt
will accelerate to 7.5 percent this year after the government
cut taxes and tariffs to spur investment, Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif said in a Jan. 25 interview. </p>
<p>The IMF expects Middle Eastern countries will earn a
combined current account surplus of $306 billion in 2007, up
from $282 billion in 2006, it says on its Web site. </p>
<h2>Wall Street </h2>
<p>JPMorgan Cazenove and Bear Stearns, Wall Street''s fifth-biggest firm, join Western investors including Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)
and Carlyle Group raising money to buy Middle East and North
African companies. </p>
<p>Deutsche in May started a $2 billion Islamic private
equity fund for the region with Dubai''s Abraaj Capital and
Bahrain''s Ithmaar Bank that aims to grow investors'' money by 15
percent a year. Muslim Shariah law forbids investment in
companies with high levels of debt or that are active in
proscribed businesses like gaming and alcohol sales. </p>
<p>Carlyle, manager of more than $44 billion worldwide, plans
to hire 15 people to buy companies and identify potential
partners in the Middle East, North Africa and Turkey, Walid Musallam, the U.S. buyout firm''s regional managing director,
said in November. </p>
<h2>20 Percent Return </h2>
<p>Global Investment''s 7-year fund will seek buyouts of
between $100 million and $150 million to achieve an internal
rate of return of 20 percent for its investors, according to
Dash. </p>
<p>Private equity raised $432 billion globally last year, led
by buyout funds which raised $212 billion, London-based Private
Equity Intelligence Ltd. said in a Jan. 25 report. Investors
like pension funds, endowments and wealthy individuals have
poured increasing amounts of money into private equity as some
funds outperform public markets. </p>
<p>Blackstone Group LP''s 2002 $6.45 billion fund had annual
returns of 63 percent to July compared with an annual return of
6.3 percent in the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index from 2002. </p>
<p>Buyout firms typically aim to increase a company''s profit
by changing managers or strategy before selling their holdings
within five years to a new buyer or to investors in an initial
stock sale. The firms raise cash from institutional investors
and use a combination of cash and loans to make purchases. The
acquired company''s cash flow is then used to pay down debt. </p>
<p>Global Investment manages about $1 billion of private
equity investments within a total $7.2 billion of assets under
management, according to Dash. The bank''s shares closed down 1
percent to 960 fils ($3.3) in Kuwait today and have fallen by
13 percent this year. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Co. (KO) Chief Executive
Officer Neville Isdell said the world''s largest soft-drink maker
is ''''keeping our promise'''' to return the company to steady
growth by focusing on emerging markets such as China. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola''s profit has resumed growing after a two-year
slowdown, Isdell said today on a Webcast of the company''s annual
meeting in Wilmington, Delaware. The company reported yesterday
that first-quarter profit rose 14 percent on the biggest sales
gain in more than a decade. </p>
<p>''''Last year, I told you the company completed the
transition, and that stabilization would be achieved in 2006,''''
Isdell said. ''''I said as a result of that, the company would
return to sustainable growth, and my message to you today is
that we are keeping our promise.'''' </p>
<p>Coca-Cola is headed for its biggest increase in annual
profit since 2003, buoyed by demand for its drinks in fast-
growing markets such as China and Brazil. Worldwide volume
increased 6 percent in the first quarter, compared with a 3.3
percent average annual gain since Isdell became CEO in 2004. </p>
<p>Eleven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg estimate the Atlanta-
based company''s annual profit will jump 18 percent this year,
compared with a 4 percent gain last year and less than 1 percent
the prior year. </p>
<p>Shares of Coca-Cola rose 9 cents to $51.66 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading, after closing yesterday
at their highest since June 2004. The shares have gained 25
percent in the past year, compared with 13 percent for PepsiCo
Inc. </p>
<p>U.S. `Problems'' </p>
<p>Coca-Cola is still ''''working through some problems'''' in
North America, its largest unit, where volume dropped 3 percent
in the first quarter after higher prices hurt soda sales. </p>
<p>The company is trying to bolster sales with more
advertising and healthy drinks such as juices and teas made by
Fuze Beverage LLC, which Coca-Cola bought in March. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola''s soft drink volume in the U.S. dropped 1.2
percent last year, according to data by industry journal
Beverage Digest. </p>
<p>The company wants to ''''reinvigorate'''' soda sales, Isdell
said. Coca-Cola has promoted and expanded Coca-Cola Zero, a
calorie-free drink formulated to taste like regular Coke. The
company has added a cherry-flavored version, and the drink will
be available in 40 countries by the end of this year. </p>
<p>''''Along the way, we will make corrections wherever we make
inevitable mistakes as we hit the bumps that occur on the
road,'''' Isdell said. </p>
<p>Also at the meeting, shareholders voted against proposals
seeking limits on executive pay and restricted stock grants. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), the world''s second-largest securities company, raised its forecast for emerging-market stocks this year on expectations for worldwide economic
growth and rising commodity prices. </p>
<p>Jonathan Garner, head of global emerging-market strategy in
London, raised his year-end projection for the Morgan Stanley
Capital International Emerging Markets Index by 8.2 percent to
1,060. That represents a gain of 7.8 percent from yesterday''s
close. </p>
<p>The benchmark has risen 6.8 percent so far this year after
recovering from a slump that began in late February when equity
markets dropped worldwide on concerns about slowdown of the U.S.
economy. </p>
<p>''''The global growth story is about strengthening economies
in Japan, European Union, especially Germany and emerging
markets,'''' Garner said in a telephone interview. ''''It''s
inappropriate to have such a U.S. centric view.'''' </p>
<p>A report showed today that last quarter''s growth rate in the
U.S. was the weakest since the first three months of 2003,
trimmed by the slump in home construction and a bigger trade
deficit. Growth in the 12 months ended in March slowed to 2.1
percent, the weakest year-over-year gain since the second quarter
of 2003, while inflation rose. </p>
<p>Garner said the slowdown is mostly led by non-traded housing
market in the world''s largest economy and doesn''t have a major
impact on global and emerging market stocks. </p>
<h2>Counterbalance </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley expects the global economy to grow 4.5
percent this year, as it expects the slowdown of the U.S. economy
to be counterbalanced by reviving expansion in countries that
share euro currency, Garner said in the note. </p>
<p>At the same time Morgan Stanley sees commodity prices and
prices for oil to rise above prices in 2006. Garner has
recommended buying South African basic resource stocks in his

will be built in 2010 and 2011, and it will buy gas at an
''''acceptable price,'''' he said. </p>
<p>The petrochemical complex will include refineries to
process gas from the Tengiz field, and later from the Kashagan

foreign-led ventures. Basell Holdings NV, the world''s largest

<p>The trucking industry and
congressional Democrats are trying to put the brakes on state
efforts to lease toll roads to Macquarie Bank Ltd., Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) and other private investors. </p>
<p>Urged on by truckers such as U.S. Xpress Enterprises Ltd.,
House Democrats are considering withholding highway funds from
states whose leases with companies fail to meet proposed federal
standards. Critics of leasing say private investors are more
likely to raise tolls than government authorities are. Private
investors would also find it easier to fire toll collectors and
other employees. </p>
<p>New federal restrictions could make investments in the $1.7
trillion of public roadways less attractive to private interests.
And the mere fact of congressional attention might have a
chilling effect on such deals, says Mike McDermott, an analyst
who works on toll-road transactions in the New York office of
Fitch Ratings Ltd., which rates debt used to finance
infrastructure. </p>
<p>''''Those kinds of public debates would make politicians at
the state level more cautious,'''' he says. </p>
<p>For states with heavily traveled roadways, lease agreements
with the likes of Macquarie and Goldman are potential windfalls
that would allow them to meet budget needs without raising taxes. </p>
<h2>Leasing the Turnpike </h2>
<p>Pennsylvania, which says it faces a $1.7 billion shortfall
in transportation funds during the next 20 years, might raise as
much as $12 billion to $18 billion by leasing the 537-mile
Pennsylvania Turnpike, according to an analysis by Morgan
Stanley. New Jersey Democratic Governor Jon Corzine, 60, is also
looking at leasing state toll roads to raise money for highway
construction and maintenance. </p>
<p>Such arrangements are common in Australia, Chile, Spain and
elsewhere around the world. Sydney-based Macquarie, the world''s
largest private manager of public facilities, said last month
that it raised $10 billion to buy more infrastructure assets in
Europe and North America. Those assets would be added to its
existing stakes in the Indiana Toll Road -- leased in 2006 for
$3.85 billion -- and the Chicago Skyway, leased for 99 years in
2005 for $1.83 billion. </p>
<p>New York-based Goldman Sachs, the biggest U.S. securities
firm by market value, raised $6.5 billion last year for a new
fund to invest in toll roads and other infrastructure. Goldman is
one of 48 firms interested in leasing the Pennsylvania Turnpike. </p>
<h2>Shortchanging the Public </h2>
<p>Alex Doughty, a spokesman for New York-based Macquarie
Infrastructure Group, didn''t respond to requests for comment.
Goldman Sachs spokesman Michael DuVally declined to comment. </p>
<p>House Democrats say they are concerned the public will be
shortchanged by long-term private leases. ''''Public-private
partnerships need to take the public interests in mind,'''' House
Transportation Committee Chairman Jim Oberstar, 72, a Minnesota
Democrat, said in a statement provided by his office. </p>
<p>Oberstar''s proposed guidelines for private leasing
agreements would include guarantees that states could upgrade
highways parallel to leased toll roads and protection against
price gouging by private companies. States that didn''t comply
would face the loss of federal highway funds. </p>
<p>Oberstar and House highways subcommittee chairman Peter DeFazio have sent letters to state officials urging them to go
slow. ''''If public-private partnerships are abused, what you will
cause is a reaction on the state and federal level that will put
an end to this,'''' says DeFazio, 60, an Oregon Democrat. </p>
<p>A `Patronage Bastion'' </p>
<p>Pennsylvania Governor Edward Rendell -- like Oberstar and
DeFazio, a Democrat -- says the congressional concerns are
overblown. In his state, Rendell, 63, said in an interview, much
of the opposition to leasing the turnpike has come from
entrenched partisan interests fearing the loss of what has been a
''''huge patronage bastion for both political parties.'''' </p>
<p>Congressional Democrats have found unlikely allies in
Chattanooga, Tennessee-based U.S. Xpress and other trucking
companies, which in the last 10 years have given about 80 percent
of their campaign donations to Republicans, according to the
Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based research
group. </p>
<p>The growing interest in road leasing shows that ''''someone''s
figured out how to make a lot of money doing these deals and also
that someone, probably the users of these roads, is going to pay
exponentially,'''' says former Kansas Governor Bill Graves, 54,
chief executive of the American Trucking Associations. The trade
group, based in Alexandria, Virginia, represents among others
U.S. Xpress and Overland Park, Kansas-based YRC Worldwide Inc. (YRCW),
the largest U.S. trucking company. </p>
<h2>Taxes Over Tolls </h2>
<p>The truckers'' trade group says the industry pays $3 billion
to $4 billion a year in tolls now. Graves, a Republican, says the
industry would prefer higher fuel taxes to increased tolls. </p>
<p>Large trucking companies typically sign long-term contracts
with customers that factor in fuel-price fluctuations. Patrick Quinn, 61, president of U.S. Xpress and chairman of the ATA, said
in an interview that private control of U.S. highways is
''''unpredictable and unknown'''' and could increase tolls. </p>
<p>Frequent toll hikes, Quinn says, would make cost planning
difficult. ''''We feel kind of comfortable with the system'''' now,
he says. </p>
<p>After Indiana signed its lease agreement, truck tolls on its
157-mile toll road rose 24 percent -- the first increase since
1985. They rose another 25 percent in April and are due to go up
again in 2008 and 2009. </p>
<h2>Benefits and Risks </h2>
<p>For politicians, there may be both benefits and risks in
such arrangements. Private control may free officials from being
blamed for higher tolls, says McDermott, the Fitch Ratings
analyst. They can say ''''it''s not me that''s raising rates,'''' he
says. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the higher charges in Indiana helped
Democrats capture control of the state House of Representatives
and win a congressional seat in the district that straddles the
highway. </p>
<p>''''People thought it was done in an unfair way, and they
wanted someone who would stand up for it,'''' says Democratic U.S.
Representative Joe Donnelly, 51, who ousted Republican Chris Chocola, 45. </p>
<p>Matt Pierce, a spokesman for the Indiana Toll Road, says the
lease benefits motorists. ''''Our primary responsibility is to the
consumers who travel the road,'''' he says. ''''We''re selling them
time. We''re selling them that ease of moving the goods.'''' </p>
<p>The Bush administration is backing the states'' drive to get
business investment to run highways. ''''Public-private
partnerships are vital to fixing this nation''s mounting mobility
crisis because private investment is based on demand and not
political influence,'''' Transportation Secretary Mary Peters, 58,
told a highway group in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, on June 1. </p>
<p>With Bush''s backing, and given the financial needs of the
states, Pennsylvania''s Rendell predicts more such deals in the
future. The balding governor says he''ll be able to ''''comb my hair
in a pompadour'''' before Congress clamps down on the trend. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX) and PTT Exploration
and Production Pcl (PTTEP), Thailand''s two biggest natural gas
producers, have got an extension on their exploration and
production contracts at some fields. </p>
<p>Chevron can continue exploration and production at three
blocks in the Gulf of Thailand for another 10 years, Energy
Minister Piyasvasti Amranand said in an interview in Bangkok
today. PTT Exploration will also receive permission to develop
the Bongkot field for another 10 years, he said. The contracts
for those gas and oil fields were scheduled to expire in 2012. </p>
<p>Thailand has given more areas to Chevron, PTT Exploration,
Hess Corp. and other companies to explore as part of the
government''s attempt to boost domestic output of natural gas
and oil. The country imports almost all of its crude oil and
about a third of natural gas. </p>
<p>''''Those companies should give more time to develop those
fields as they have done a very good job in exploration and
production,'''' said Piyasvasti. ''''There are significant amounts
of remaining natural gas reserves in those fields that need
additional investments to be developed.'''' </p>
<p>Chevron may invest $8 billion in the Southeast Asian
nation should the government extend its concessions for another
10 years, the Bangkok Post reported today, citing Songpop
Polachan, deputy director of the Mineral Fuels Department. </p>
<p>Chevron is working with the department to extend
production period for Blocks 10 to 13 under the existing
concessions until 2022, Nicole Hodgson, Chevron''s spokeswoman
in Bangkok, said in an e-mailed response to a question today.
Hodgson declined to comment on the report about Chevron''s
investment plan, saying: ''''Chevron does not release forward
looking investment figures by country.'''' </p>
<p>Chevron, the second-biggest U.S. oil company, had invested
$11.2 billion in gas and oil exploration and production in
Thailand between 1962 and 2005, according to the company''s data. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world''s largest
soft-drink maker, and its Mexican bottler received antitrust
approval to buy a juice producer for $380 million with
conditions to encourage competition. </p>
<p>Mexico''s antitrust agency approved the purchase of Mexican
juice-maker Jugos del Valle SAB on the condition that Coca-Cola
and local bottler Coca-Cola Femsa SAB don''t impose exclusivity
contracts on retailers or tie juice sales to soft-drink sales,
the regulator said in an e-mailed statement today. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola and Coca-Cola Femsa agreed to buy Jugos del
Valle, Mexico''s second-largest juice producer, in December to
boost non-carbonated drink sales in Latin America. The company
sells drinks under brands such as Frutsi and Bebere in Mexico
and Brazil. </p>
<p>Antitrust regulators blocked the purchase in May, then
reversed themselves yesterday with the conditional approval
after the companies appealed. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola owns 32 percent of Coca-Cola Femsa, which is a
unit of Fomento Economico Mexicano SA (FEMSAUBD), Latin America''s largest
beverage company. </p>
<p>The agency also limited exclusive sales to Fomento
Economico''s OXXO stores and said refrigerators the companies
provide to small retailers must be able to display competing
drinks. The companies must also divest Jugos del Valle''s soft-
drink brands, among other conditions. </p>
<p>Separately today, Jugos del Valle said securities
regulators fined the company for failing to fully inform the
public during its sale to Coca-Cola and Coca-Cola Femsa. </p>
<p>Mexico''s National Banking and Securities Commission said
the company''s statements to the stock exchange before the sale
were ''''insufficient.'''' The commission fined the company 1.9
million pesos ($176,540), Mexico City-based Jugos del Valle
said. </p>
<p>Shares of Coca-Cola rose 26 cents to $53.43 at 4:01 p.m. in

<p>Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world''s largest

juice line to capture more sales in the faster-growing market. </p>
<p>The first variety of Odwalla Serious Energy is made with
pineapple, mango, guava and passion-fruit juices, Atlanta-based
Coca-Cola said today in an e-mailed statement. The 15.2-ounce

million cases, led by Full Throttle and Tab Energy, according to
data from industry journal Beverage Digest. </p>
<p>The company''s soft-drink sales have dropped for four
straight quarters in North America. Coca-Cola Classic, the top-
selling soda, posted a 2 percent drop in volume last year to
1.76 billion cases in the U.S., according to Beverage Digest. </p>
<p>The Odwalla energy drink has extracts of guarana, yerba
mate, green tea and ginseng, which the company says help
increase alertness. Some of those ingredients have naturally
occurring caffeine, although no additional caffeine is added,
