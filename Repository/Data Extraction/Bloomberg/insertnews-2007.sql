            <p>NYSE Group Inc. and Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. led a group of investors that agreed to buy 20 percent
            of the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd., tapping the world''s
            second-fastest-growing major economy. </p>
            <p>The National exchange will receive $115 million from NYSE
            Group for a 5 percent stake in a transaction that values India''s
            largest equity market at $2.3 billion. Goldman, General Atlantic
            LLC and Softbank Asian Infrastructure Fund will buy 5 percent
            each, the closely held NSE said without disclosing a price. </p>
            <p>NYSE Group, operator of the world''s biggest stock exchange,
            is making its first investment in Asia through a market where the
            combined worth of equities rose 50 percent in the past two years
            to $820 billion. The Indian government lifted a ban on foreign
            ownership three weeks ago as markets race to make acquisitions
            and expand internationally into trading multiple securities. </p>
            <p>''''Goldman and NYSE are clearly investing in India''s long-term growth story,'''' said Navneet
            Munot, who helps manage the
            equivalent of $4 billion of Indian stocks and bonds at Birla
            Sunlife Asset Management Co. in Mumbai. ''''For NSE, a tie-up with
            the NYSE would mean technology, visibility and access to new
            financial products.'''' </p>
            <p>India''s government on Dec. 22 allowed international
            investors to buy as much as a combined 49 percent in any of the
            nation''s 22 stock exchanges. The limit for a single investor was
            set at 5 percent by the Securities and Exchange Board of India. </p>
            <h2>Closest Competitor </h2>
            <p>The Mumbai-based National Stock Exchange, home to companies
            such as Reliance Industries Ltd. and Infosys Technologies Ltd.,
            handled a daily average of 72.3 billion rupees ($1.6 billion) in
            the past six months. That''s more than twice the value of its
            closest competitor, the Bombay Stock Exchange. </p>
            <p>The 14-year-old National exchange also dominates trading in
            equity-based futures contracts and owns stakes in India''s
            National Commodity Derivatives Exchange and the Multi-Commodity
            Exchange. </p>
            <p>India''s gross domestic product grew 9.2 percent in the three
            months through September, second only to China among the world''s
            major economies. India may overtake China in growth this year,
            Credit Suisse Group economists estimated in December. </p>
            <p>The investment may help the NYSE draw the listing of Indian
            companies, said NYSE Group Chief Financial Officer Nelson Chai.
            It currently lists 10 Indian companies. </p>
            <h2>Investing in Asia </h2>
            <p>''''We are going to be on the ground with them, meeting people
            both at the corporate level and also within the regulatory and
            government level,'''' Chai told reports in a conference call from
            Delhi. ''''We are neither in a control position nor in a position
            to capture cost synergies. But we do believe there are long-term
            growth prospects here, and we''re closer to participating in that
            growth.'''' </p>
            <p>Chief Executive Officer John Thain said on Dec. 20 NYSE
            Group was looking to invest in Japan, China or India after
            shareholders approved its $14.6 billion purchase of Euronext NV.
            Thain, who joined the NYSE in 2004 from Goldman, has extend the
            exchange''s reach overseas and beyond equities trading since
            transforming the 214-year-old market into a publicly traded
            company through the acquisition of Archipelago Holdings Inc. in
            March. </p>
            <p>NYSE Group shares rose $3.63, or 3.5 percent, to $108.21 at
            4:01 p.m. in composite trading in New York. The stock has gained
            68 percent since its debut March 8. </p>
            <h2>Exchange Ownership </h2>
            <p>Rival exchanges have also pursued international
            acquisitions. Nasdaq Stock Market Inc. this week urged
            shareholders of the London Stock Exchange Plc to accept its
            takeover bid that values the company at 2.7 billion pounds ($5.2
            billion). The Bombay exchange is considering selling stakes to
            five overseas investors, India''s Business Standard reported last
            week, citing people it didn''t identify. </p>
            <p>India''s government said today it will set rules within six
            weeks opening up the nation''s $600 billion commodities markets to
            international investors, clearing the way for the world''s third-largest gold exchange to sell shares. </p>
            <p>''''We hope to announce norms related to exchange ownership
            soon,'''' Yashwant Bhave, secretary at the department of Consumer
            Affairs, said today in Mumbai. ''''Norms on foreign investors''
            participation in the market will also be announced.'''' </p>
            <p>The deal unveiled today will be completed this quarter,
            subject to regulatory approvals from various Indian government
            agencies, the NYSE said in a statement. The 20 percent stake will
            be sold by companies including ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC), IFCI Ltd. (IFCI), ILFS
            Trust Company Ltd., Punjab National Bank (PNB) Ltd. and General
            Insurance Corp. of India Ltd., the National exchange said in its
            statement. </p>
            <h2>Goldman and NYSE </h2>
            <p>Goldman, the most profitable brokerage in Wall Street
            history, already owns a 7 percent stake in India''s National
            Commodity Derivatives Exchange Ltd. Goldman and the buyout firm
            General Atlantic were early investors in Archipelago and are
            currently among the top five shareholders of NYSE Group. </p>
            <p>General Atlantic, which overseas $12 billion in Greenwich,
            Connecticut, last year acquired a stake in the New York
            Mercantile Exchange in anticipation of an initial public
            offering. Since their debut in November, shares of the world''s
            largest energy exchange have more than doubled. </p>

            <p>Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world''s largest
            soft-drink maker, will shift some of outgoing marketing chief
            Mary Minnick''s responsibilities to recently promoted President
            Muhtar Kent. </p>
            <p>Kent will oversee marketing for the Atlanta-based company
            beginning March 1, Chief Executive Officer Neville Isdell, said
            today in an internal memo to employees. Minnick, who was passed
            over when Kent was named president and chief operating officer
            in December, said last week she will leave in February to pursue
            other personal and professional goals in the U.K. </p>
            <p>The move gives more responsibility to Kent, 54, who is
            Coca-Cola''s second-highest ranking executive and likely
            successor to Isdell. Coca-Cola''s strategy and innovation groups,
            formerly overseen by Minnick, will report to Isdell. </p>
            <p>''''As the health of our business continues to improve, the
            factors that necessitated the combining of marketing, strategy
            and innovation have evolved,'''' Isdell, 63, said in the memo. </p>
            <p>The new structure allows Coca-Cola to ''''increase the impact
            and effectiveness of the global marketing community, while
            preserving the benefits we have captured'''' by previously
            combining the groups, wrote Isdell, who hasn''t said when he
            plans to retire. </p>

            including Dasani and Powerade. </p>
            <p>Shares of Coca-Cola fell 23 cents to $48.03 at 4 p.m. in

            <p>Coca-Cola Co. (KO) will go head-to-head
            with PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) in Super Bowl television advertising for the
            first time in almost a decade as it tries to boost sales of its
            top-selling drink. </p>
            <p>One new ad for Coca-Cola Classic will air during
            professional football''s championship game along with two spots
            that debuted during the television show ''''American Idol,'''' the
            Atlanta-based company said in a statement today. Coca-Cola hasn''t
            run promotions during the Super Bowl since 1998. </p>
            <p>Advertising during television''s most-watched event pits
            Coca-Cola against PepsiCo as both companies try to reverse a drop
            in U.S. soda sales. PepsiCo has advertised during the Super Bowl
            for 21 consecutive years and will sponsor the half-time show for
            the first time. </p>
            <p>''''Coke wants back in the game,'''' said Z. John Zhang,
            marketing professor at the Wharton School at the University of
            Pennsylvania. ''''They''ve waited this many years to come back, so
            the pressure is on them to have the louder voice.'''' </p>
            <p>Both soft-drink makers are trying to stop declines in the
            U.S., where soda consumption dropped in 2005 for the first time
            in at least 15 years because of concern that sugary beverages
            contribute to obesity. Coca-Cola''s soft drink volume fell 1
            percent in North America during the third quarter, and PepsiCo''s
            dropped 2 percent. </p>
            <h2>Cost of Ads </h2>
            <p>Coca-Cola''s Super Bowl advertisements include a 60-second
            spot titled ''''Video Game,'''' showing a character who passes out
            bottles of Coca-Cola Classic to people he meets on the street.
            Coca-Cola will also run a 30-second ad called ''''Happiness
            Factory'''' that follows a bottle of Coke through an imaginary
            vending machine. </p>
            <p>The company won''t say anything about the new commercial
            being made for the Super Bowl. The ads were created by
            independent agency Wieden + Kennedy, based in Portland, Oregon. </p>
            <p>''''Coca-Cola Classic has always been about having fun, and
            that''s what people get together to do when they watch the Super
            Bowl,'''' said Katie Bayne, senior vice president for Coca-Cola
            brands in North America. </p>
            <p>Shares of Coca-Cola fell 1 cent to $48.13 at 4 p.m. in New
            York Stock Exchange composite trading. They gained 20 percent
            last year, the biggest gain since 1997. </p>
            <p>PepsiCo shares climbed 36 cents to $65.20. They rose 5.9
            percent last year. </p>
            <p>Coca-Cola spokeswoman Susan McDermott wouldn''t say how much
            the company is spending on the game. A 30-second ad during the
            Super Bowl can cost $2.5 million, according to AdWeek. Coca-
            Cola''s advertising budget was $2.48 billion in 2005. </p>
            <h2>Bears vs. Colts </h2>
            <p>More than 141 million people watched last year''s Super Bowl.
            This year''s game, scheduled for Feb. 4 at Dolphin Stadium in
            Miami Gardens, Fla., is a match-up between the Chicago Bears and
            the Indianapolis Colts. </p>
            <p>The Super Bowl will be broadcast on CBS Corp.''s CBS network.
            The television show American Idol, the most popular show on
            primetime television, airs on News Corp.''s Fox network. </p>
            <p>In addition to the half-time show sponsorship, PepsiCo plans
            to run 90 seconds of ads during the first half of the Super Bowl,
            spokeswoman Nicole Bradley said. She wouldn''t say how much the
            company is spending, or which ads it plans to run. </p>
            <p>PepsiCo has a promotion featuring a sterling silver can of
            Pepsi studded with diamonds, rubies and sapphires. The company
            will give away the can, worth $100,000, and Super Bowl tickets
            for life after the half-time show, which includes a performance
            by the musician Prince. </p>
            <p>''''We thrive on the Super Bowl spotlight. It''s been a part of
            our game plan for more than two decades,'''' Bradley said. </p>
            <p>Last year, Coca-Cola sponsored a Super Bowl pre-game show
            with its Full Throttle energy drink. Ads showed a semi-tractor
            trailer truck mounted with an oversized can of Full Throttle
            overtaking a small pickup truck with a slender can of rival
            energy drink Red Bull. </p>

            <p>Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world''s largest
            soft-drink maker, agreed to buy Fuze Beverage LLC to add more
            juice, tea and energy drinks in an effort to catch up with
            PepsiCo Inc. </p>
            <p>Coca-Cola gains a half-dozen new products including Fuze
            Tea, NOS energy drinks and Fuze Slenderize, which has chromium
            and amino acids that Fuze says help promote weight loss. Atlanta-
            based Coca-Cola didn''t disclose terms of the purchase. </p>
            <p>Fuze beverages may help Coca-Cola win back customers who
            switched from sugary sodas to drinks such as PepsiCo''s SoBe tea.
            It''s Coca-Cola''s biggest U.S. acquisition since buying Odwalla
            Inc. in 2001 for $186 million to gain protein drinks and juices,
            said John Sicher, editor of industry journal Beverage Digest. </p>
            <p>''''This represents Coke aggressively getting itself into a
            better place in the noncarbonated business in the U.S.,'''' Sicher
            said. ''''Fuze is small but growing strongly.'''' </p>
            <p>Sicher estimated that Coca-Cola paid $225 million to $250
            million for closely held Fuze. He said the Englewood Cliffs, New
            Jersey-based company sold about 11.5 million cases last year, up
            from 8 million cases in 2005, generating $90 million to $100
            million in revenue. </p>
            <p>Shares of Coca-Cola rose 22 cents to $48.10 at 4:22 p.m. in
            New York Stock Exchange composite trading. They increased 20
            percent last year, their biggest gain since 1997. </p>
            <h2>Bottlers </h2>
            <p>The Fuze purchase may help sate bottlers that had
            complained about Coca-Cola falling behind PepsiCo in adding
            drinks other than soda. Coca-Cola depends on soda for 80 percent
            of its volume, compared with less than 20 percent for PepsiCo. </p>
            <p>Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (CCE), the largest distributor, agreed
            to distribute Arizona bottled teas in the U.S. last year, making
            good on a promise to get new drinks from someone other than Coca-
            Cola if it needed to. The bottler is 36 percent owned by Coca-
            Cola. </p>
            <p>''''This should be well-received by Coke''s bottlers,'''' Bill Pecoriello, an analyst at Morgan
            Stanley, wrote today in a note. </p>
            <p>Fuze was already distributed by 20 Coca-Cola bottlers
            including Coca-Cola Bottling Co. United of Birmingham, Alabama,
            and the Philadelphia Coca-Cola Bottling Co. </p>
            <p>Only about 15 percent of Fuze''s volume currently goes
            through Coca-Cola bottlers, Pecoriello wrote. The Cadbury
            Schweppes Bottling Group had distributed Fuze in much of the
            U.S., Sicher said. </p>
            <p>Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated, the second-largest
            bottler for Coca-Cola, sells Cinnabon bottled coffee and created
            a separate unit called Beverages and Beyond Brands to create or
            buy drinks it wasn''t getting from the soda maker. </p>
            <p>Coca-Cola''s soda volume in the U.S. dropped by a low single
            digit in 2005, while noncarbonated volume jumped 10 percent. </p>

cut taxes and tariffs to spur investment, Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif said in a Jan. 25 interview. </p>
<p>The IMF expects Middle Eastern countries will earn a
combined current account surplus of $306 billion in 2007, up
from $282 billion in 2006, it says on its Web site. </p>
<h2>Wall Street </h2>
<p>JPMorgan Cazenove and Bear Stearns, Wall Street''s fifth-biggest firm, join Western investors including Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)
and Carlyle Group raising money to buy Middle East and North
African companies. </p>
<p>Deutsche in May started a $2 billion Islamic private
equity fund for the region with Dubai''s Abraaj Capital and
Bahrain''s Ithmaar Bank that aims to grow investors'' money by 15
percent a year. Muslim Shariah law forbids investment in
companies with high levels of debt or that are active in
proscribed businesses like gaming and alcohol sales. </p>
<p>Carlyle, manager of more than $44 billion worldwide, plans
to hire 15 people to buy companies and identify potential
partners in the Middle East, North Africa and Turkey, Walid Musallam, the U.S. buyout firm''s regional managing director,
said in November. </p>
<h2>20 Percent Return </h2>
<p>Global Investment''s 7-year fund will seek buyouts of
between $100 million and $150 million to achieve an internal
rate of return of 20 percent for its investors, according to
Dash. </p>
<p>Private equity raised $432 billion globally last year, led
by buyout funds which raised $212 billion, London-based Private
Equity Intelligence Ltd. said in a Jan. 25 report. Investors
like pension funds, endowments and wealthy individuals have
poured increasing amounts of money into private equity as some
funds outperform public markets. </p>
<p>Blackstone Group LP''s 2002 $6.45 billion fund had annual
returns of 63 percent to July compared with an annual return of
6.3 percent in the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index from 2002. </p>
<p>Buyout firms typically aim to increase a company''s profit
by changing managers or strategy before selling their holdings
within five years to a new buyer or to investors in an initial
stock sale. The firms raise cash from institutional investors
and use a combination of cash and loans to make purchases. The
acquired company''s cash flow is then used to pay down debt. </p>
<p>Global Investment manages about $1 billion of private
equity investments within a total $7.2 billion of assets under
management, according to Dash. The bank''s shares closed down 1
percent to 960 fils ($3.3) in Kuwait today and have fallen by
13 percent this year. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Co. (KO) Chief Executive
Officer Neville Isdell said the world''s largest soft-drink maker
is ''''keeping our promise'''' to return the company to steady
growth by focusing on emerging markets such as China. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola''s profit has resumed growing after a two-year
slowdown, Isdell said today on a Webcast of the company''s annual
meeting in Wilmington, Delaware. The company reported yesterday
that first-quarter profit rose 14 percent on the biggest sales
gain in more than a decade. </p>
<p>''''Last year, I told you the company completed the
transition, and that stabilization would be achieved in 2006,''''
Isdell said. ''''I said as a result of that, the company would
return to sustainable growth, and my message to you today is
that we are keeping our promise.'''' </p>
<p>Coca-Cola is headed for its biggest increase in annual
profit since 2003, buoyed by demand for its drinks in fast-
growing markets such as China and Brazil. Worldwide volume
increased 6 percent in the first quarter, compared with a 3.3
percent average annual gain since Isdell became CEO in 2004. </p>
<p>Eleven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg estimate the Atlanta-
based company''s annual profit will jump 18 percent this year,
compared with a 4 percent gain last year and less than 1 percent
the prior year. </p>
<p>Shares of Coca-Cola rose 9 cents to $51.66 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading, after closing yesterday
at their highest since June 2004. The shares have gained 25
percent in the past year, compared with 13 percent for PepsiCo
Inc. </p>
<p>U.S. `Problems'' </p>
<p>Coca-Cola is still ''''working through some problems'''' in
North America, its largest unit, where volume dropped 3 percent
in the first quarter after higher prices hurt soda sales. </p>
<p>The company is trying to bolster sales with more
advertising and healthy drinks such as juices and teas made by
Fuze Beverage LLC, which Coca-Cola bought in March. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola''s soft drink volume in the U.S. dropped 1.2
percent last year, according to data by industry journal
Beverage Digest. </p>
<p>The company wants to ''''reinvigorate'''' soda sales, Isdell
said. Coca-Cola has promoted and expanded Coca-Cola Zero, a
calorie-free drink formulated to taste like regular Coke. The
company has added a cherry-flavored version, and the drink will
be available in 40 countries by the end of this year. </p>
<p>''''Along the way, we will make corrections wherever we make
inevitable mistakes as we hit the bumps that occur on the
road,'''' Isdell said. </p>
<p>Also at the meeting, shareholders voted against proposals
seeking limits on executive pay and restricted stock grants. </p>

<p>A Chevron Corp. (CVX) unit that produces
about a quarter of Kazakhstan''s oil will provide 7 billion cubic
meters of gas a year to the country''s first ''''world-scale''''
petrochemical complex when it opens in 2011. </p>
<p>The Chevron unit, Tengizchevroil LLP, and Kazakhstan
Petrochemical Industries signed an agreement today to supply gas
from the Tengiz field to the petrochemical complex planned in
western Kazakhstan, the state-run news agency Kazinform reported
from Atyrau. </p>
<p>''''The memorandum of understanding is an important milestone
in our discussions with Kazakhstan Petrochemical Industries, a

e-mail. </p>
<p>''''Tengizchevroil and KPI have worked to outline terms for
the sales of feedstock to KPI for their planned petrochemical

<p>Kazakhstan Petrochemical Industries is a venture between a
publicly traded subsidiary of KazMunaiGaz National Co., the
state-owned oil and gas company, and Sat  Co., a privately
owned Kazakh industrial company. </p>
<h2>Tengizchevroil''s Supplies </h2>
<p>Tengizchevroil will supply 7 billion cubic meters of dry
gas and 550,000 tons of liquid propane to the plant, Shukhrat
Danbay, KazMunaiGaz National''s executive director of refining
and petrochemicals, said in a phone interview today. The complex
will be built in 2010 and 2011, and it will buy gas at an
''''acceptable price,'''' he said. </p>
<p>The petrochemical complex will include refineries to
process gas from the Tengiz field, and later from the Kashagan
and Karachaganak fields, all of which are being developed by
foreign-led ventures. Basell Holdings NV, the world''s largest
producer of polypropylene, used to make car fenders, will help
build and manage the refineries. </p>
<p>The partners also have an agreement with an Eni SpA-led
group to provide supplies of 3 billion cubic meters of dry gas
from the Kashagan field, according to the Energy Ministry''s May
17 statement. Eni expects to start production in 2010 at
Kashagan, the largest discovery worldwide in the past 30 years. </p>
<p>Chevron''s venture plans to nearly double oil production to
550,000 barrels a day after building a $5.5 billion gas-processing plant and gas-injection system for oil extraction in
2008, TengizChevroil said in January. </p>

<p>The trucking industry and
congressional Democrats are trying to put the brakes on state
efforts to lease toll roads to Macquarie Bank Ltd., Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) and other private investors. </p>
<p>Urged on by truckers such as U.S. Xpress Enterprises Ltd.,
House Democrats are considering withholding highway funds from
states whose leases with companies fail to meet proposed federal
standards. Critics of leasing say private investors are more
likely to raise tolls than government authorities are. Private
investors would also find it easier to fire toll collectors and
other employees. </p>
<p>New federal restrictions could make investments in the $1.7
trillion of public roadways less attractive to private interests.
And the mere fact of congressional attention might have a
chilling effect on such deals, says Mike McDermott, an analyst
who works on toll-road transactions in the New York office of
Fitch Ratings Ltd., which rates debt used to finance
infrastructure. </p>
<p>''''Those kinds of public debates would make politicians at
the state level more cautious,'''' he says. </p>
<p>For states with heavily traveled roadways, lease agreements
with the likes of Macquarie and Goldman are potential windfalls
that would allow them to meet budget needs without raising taxes. </p>
<h2>Leasing the Turnpike </h2>
<p>Pennsylvania, which says it faces a $1.7 billion shortfall
in transportation funds during the next 20 years, might raise as
much as $12 billion to $18 billion by leasing the 537-mile
Pennsylvania Turnpike, according to an analysis by Morgan
Stanley. New Jersey Democratic Governor Jon Corzine, 60, is also
looking at leasing state toll roads to raise money for highway
construction and maintenance. </p>
<p>Such arrangements are common in Australia, Chile, Spain and
elsewhere around the world. Sydney-based Macquarie, the world''s
largest private manager of public facilities, said last month
that it raised $10 billion to buy more infrastructure assets in
Europe and North America. Those assets would be added to its
existing stakes in the Indiana Toll Road -- leased in 2006 for
$3.85 billion -- and the Chicago Skyway, leased for 99 years in
2005 for $1.83 billion. </p>
<p>New York-based Goldman Sachs, the biggest U.S. securities
firm by market value, raised $6.5 billion last year for a new
fund to invest in toll roads and other infrastructure. Goldman is
one of 48 firms interested in leasing the Pennsylvania Turnpike. </p>
<h2>Shortchanging the Public </h2>
<p>Alex Doughty, a spokesman for New York-based Macquarie
Infrastructure Group, didn''t respond to requests for comment.
Goldman Sachs spokesman Michael DuVally declined to comment. </p>
<p>House Democrats say they are concerned the public will be
shortchanged by long-term private leases. ''''Public-private
partnerships need to take the public interests in mind,'''' House
Transportation Committee Chairman Jim Oberstar, 72, a Minnesota
Democrat, said in a statement provided by his office. </p>
<p>Oberstar''s proposed guidelines for private leasing
agreements would include guarantees that states could upgrade
highways parallel to leased toll roads and protection against
price gouging by private companies. States that didn''t comply
would face the loss of federal highway funds. </p>
<p>Oberstar and House highways subcommittee chairman Peter DeFazio have sent letters to state officials urging them to go
slow. ''''If public-private partnerships are abused, what you will
cause is a reaction on the state and federal level that will put
an end to this,'''' says DeFazio, 60, an Oregon Democrat. </p>
<p>A `Patronage Bastion'' </p>
<p>Pennsylvania Governor Edward Rendell -- like Oberstar and
DeFazio, a Democrat -- says the congressional concerns are
overblown. In his state, Rendell, 63, said in an interview, much
of the opposition to leasing the turnpike has come from
entrenched partisan interests fearing the loss of what has been a
''''huge patronage bastion for both political parties.'''' </p>
<p>Congressional Democrats have found unlikely allies in
Chattanooga, Tennessee-based U.S. Xpress and other trucking
companies, which in the last 10 years have given about 80 percent
of their campaign donations to Republicans, according to the
Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based research
group. </p>
<p>The growing interest in road leasing shows that ''''someone''s
figured out how to make a lot of money doing these deals and also
that someone, probably the users of these roads, is going to pay
exponentially,'''' says former Kansas Governor Bill Graves, 54,
chief executive of the American Trucking Associations. The trade
group, based in Alexandria, Virginia, represents among others
U.S. Xpress and Overland Park, Kansas-based YRC Worldwide Inc. (YRCW),
the largest U.S. trucking company. </p>
<h2>Taxes Over Tolls </h2>
<p>The truckers'' trade group says the industry pays $3 billion
to $4 billion a year in tolls now. Graves, a Republican, says the
industry would prefer higher fuel taxes to increased tolls. </p>
<p>Large trucking companies typically sign long-term contracts
with customers that factor in fuel-price fluctuations. Patrick Quinn, 61, president of U.S. Xpress and chairman of the ATA, said
in an interview that private control of U.S. highways is
''''unpredictable and unknown'''' and could increase tolls. </p>
<p>Frequent toll hikes, Quinn says, would make cost planning
difficult. ''''We feel kind of comfortable with the system'''' now,
he says. </p>
<p>After Indiana signed its lease agreement, truck tolls on its
157-mile toll road rose 24 percent -- the first increase since
1985. They rose another 25 percent in April and are due to go up
again in 2008 and 2009. </p>
<h2>Benefits and Risks </h2>
<p>For politicians, there may be both benefits and risks in
such arrangements. Private control may free officials from being
blamed for higher tolls, says McDermott, the Fitch Ratings
analyst. They can say ''''it''s not me that''s raising rates,'''' he
says. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the higher charges in Indiana helped
Democrats capture control of the state House of Representatives
and win a congressional seat in the district that straddles the
highway. </p>
<p>''''People thought it was done in an unfair way, and they
wanted someone who would stand up for it,'''' says Democratic U.S.
Representative Joe Donnelly, 51, who ousted Republican Chris Chocola, 45. </p>
<p>Matt Pierce, a spokesman for the Indiana Toll Road, says the
lease benefits motorists. ''''Our primary responsibility is to the
consumers who travel the road,'''' he says. ''''We''re selling them
time. We''re selling them that ease of moving the goods.'''' </p>
<p>The Bush administration is backing the states'' drive to get
business investment to run highways. ''''Public-private
partnerships are vital to fixing this nation''s mounting mobility
crisis because private investment is based on demand and not
political influence,'''' Transportation Secretary Mary Peters, 58,
told a highway group in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, on June 1. </p>
<p>With Bush''s backing, and given the financial needs of the
states, Pennsylvania''s Rendell predicts more such deals in the
future. The balding governor says he''ll be able to ''''comb my hair
in a pompadour'''' before Congress clamps down on the trend. </p>

analysts said. ''''We believe the European manufacturers are well
placed to benefit from emerging market growth.'''' </p>
<p>The Goldman analysts also said they expect Renault shares
to rise 60 percent over the next year. ''''We believe that 2006
marked a low point for Renault''s earnings, while the recent
first-half results highlight that the company is well positioned
to deliver on its 3 percent operating margin target,'''' the
analysts said. </p>
<h2>Growth Markets </h2>
<p>European carmakers have expanded into growing markets such
as Russia, China and India with new factories and sales networks
as demand stagnates in their domestic markets, the U.S. and
Japan. </p>
<p>Fiat has introduced new models such as the 500, an updated
version of the small car popular in the 1950s and 1960s, which
join vehicles such as the Grande Punto that are helping Italy''s
biggest manufacturer boost sales. Sales gained 7.2 percent in
the first six months of this year, making it the fastest-growing
European carmaker. </p>

<p>Crude oil fell more than $3 from a
record in New York after Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the bank that
said in July oil may reach $95 a barrel, told clients it''s ''''time
to take profits.'''' </p>
<p>''''When the lead bull takes a pause, you have to expect the
herd to turn,'''' said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy
 Economic Research in Winchester, Massachusetts. ''''Prices are so
high that Goldman Sachs can''t justify them.'''' </p>
<p>Goldman said in a report it was closing its long position in
New York oil futures. Long positions are bets that prices will
rise. Petroleos Mexicanos will review weather conditions and
release updated production plans today, spokesman Carlos Ramirez
said. The company cut output by 600,000 barrels a day starting
Oct. 28. </p>
<p>Crude oil for December delivery fell $3.15, or 3.4 percent,
to settle at $90.38 a barrel at 2:49 p.m. on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. It''s the biggest one-day drop since Aug. 6.
Futures climbed to $93.80 yesterday, the highest since trading
began in 1983. </p>
<p>Brent crude oil for December settlement fell $2.88, or 3.2
percent, to close at $87.44 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. It was also the biggest decline since
Aug. 6. Brent reached $90.49 a barrel yesterday, the highest
since trading began in 1988. </p>
<p>''''This isn''t a full-out correction; the market is just
taking a breather,'''' said Brad Samples, commodity analyst for
Summit Energy Services Inc. in Louisville, Kentucky. ''''When
Goldman makes a call to sell, investors listen, especially since
they have been one of the more vocal bulls in the market.'''' </p>
<p>Oil has gained 48 percent this year as hedge funds and other
large speculators increased bets on rising prices. Net-long
positions in New York crude futures in the week ended Aug. 3
jumped to the highest in more than a decade. </p>
<h2>Downside Risk </h2>
<p>''''The downside risks we have embedded in our end of first
quarter 2008 oil price target of $80 a barrel are beginning to
gain momentum,'''' the Goldman said. ''''These include increasing
exports, a slowing U.S. economy, an adequate level of heating oil
inventories.'''' </p>
<p>OPEC has a ''''duty'''' to supply the world with oil at stable
prices, Mohamed al-Hamli, the group''s president, said today at an
oil conference in London. Al-Hamli is also the oil minister of
the United Arab Emirates. If the market needs more oil, OPEC will
supply it, while the group''s spare capacity stands at 3.5 million
barrels a day, he added. </p>
<p>The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed
last month to increase output by 500,000 barrels a day starting
Nov. 1 to help ease prices that threaten economic growth. Futures
have surged 18 percent since the Sept. 11 meeting in Vienna. The
group produces 40 percent of the world''s oil. </p>
<h2>OPEC Meeting </h2>
<p>The heads of state of OPEC members will meet in Riyadh on
Nov. 17. There won''t be any decisions taken regarding oil supply
at the meeting, Al-Hamli said. Still, ministers are likely to
discuss the oil market during the summit, he said. OPEC''s next
meeting to set crude-oil production levels is scheduled for Dec.
5 in Abu Dhabi. </p>
<p>An Energy Department report tomorrow is expected to show
that U.S. crude-oil supplies rose 300,000 barrels last week,
according to the median of 15 responses in a Bloomberg News
survey. The report may show that stockpiles of distillate fuel, a
category that includes heating oil and diesel, dropped 1 million
barrels, the survey showed. </p>

<p>The outbreak of drug-resistant
infections in U.S. hospitals and schools may provide both
Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) and Pfizer Inc. with a $1 billion windfall in
a market that analysts expect will double in five years. </p>
<p>JJ, the world''s largest health-products company, and
Pfizer, the biggest drugmaker, are poised to release new
antibiotics next year to treat MRSA, or methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus. The germ sickens about 2 million
Americans annually, costs about $20 billion a year to treat, and
has reinvigorated the search for new antibiotics. </p>
<p>The two experimental drugs, modified versions of older
medicines, may create a $2.5 billion market in treatments
against MRSA and other drug-resistant bacteria that kill 20,000
Americans a year, analysts say. New York-based Pfizer needs new
medicines by 2011 to counter generic competition for drugs that
generated about half of 2006 revenue. JJ faces a similar
erosion beginning in 2009 of 41 percent of last year''s drug
sales. </p>
<p>''''Pfizer and JJ are going to get a survivor benefit from
sticking with antibiotics after almost every other big
pharmaceutical company cut back in this area,'''' said Les Funtleyder, an analyst with Miller Tabak  Co. in New York, in a
telephone interview. </p>
<p>Wyeth''s Tygacil, the first in a new family of medicines for
MRSA known as glycylcyclines, was introduced in 2005 and will
have peak sales of more than $1 billion, the Madison, New
Jersey-based drugmaker projects. Its success, and the rising
MRSA menace, has spurred antibiotic research, analysts say. </p>
<p>`Urgent Need'' </p>
<p>''''Given the urgent need for more effective antibiotics
against MRSA, I would expect the new entries from Pfizer and JJ
to perform as well as Tygacil, if not better,'''' said Danielle
Drayton, an analyst with Waltham, Massachusetts-based drug
research firm Decision Resources, in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>JJ rose 68 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $64.59 at 4:01 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, and has declined
2.2 percent this year. Pfizer fell 21 cents to $23.11, and has
fallen 11 percent in 2007. </p>
<p>Two years ago, Pfizer and New Brunswick, New Jersey-based
JJ separately obtained the drugs from biotechnology companies
working on rival antibiotics. Pfizer''s $1.9 billion acquisition
of Vicuron Pharmaceuticals Inc. in June 2005 provided access to
dalbavancin, an updated version of a class of medicines known as
glycopeptides introduced in 1958. </p>
<p>JJ in February 2005 agreed to pay Basilea (BSLN) Pharmaceutica
AG, based in Basel, Switzerland, about $308 million to jointly
develop ceftobiprole, part of a group of antibiotics known as
cephalosporins. First marketed 40 years ago, the group includes
Roche Holding AG''s Rocephin. JJ won rights to ceftobiprole
after Roche, also based in Basel, declined to license it. </p>
<p>`Strategic Deals'' </p>
<p>''''These strategic deals have positioned Pfizer and JJ to
come out ahead as panic over MRSA spins out of control,'''' said
Funtleyder. </p>
<p>MRSA is found in about 4.6 percent of hospital patients,
and accounts for almost two-thirds of skin infections in
emergency rooms, up from just 2 percent 35 years ago. About one
in 20 patients hospitalized with the drug-resistant bacterium
dies, according to the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality. </p>
<p>Because JJ''s new antibiotic is in a class that works
against a wider variety of germs, it may have an edge over
Pfizer (PFE)''s product, said Drayton. </p>
<p>''''Doctors will use a broad spectrum agent like ceftobiprole
early as a single therapy to replace older regimens that
included multiple antibiotics,'''' she said. </p>
<h2>Outside the Hospital </h2>
<p>Pfizer''s dalbavancin may be chosen to treat patients
outside the hospital because it can be injected once a week.
Vancomycin, the oldest medicine in this family, must be injected
as often as four times daily, requiring costly hospitalization
until patients complete treatment. </p>
<p>Dalbavancin was delayed by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration in June 2006. The company resubmitted its
application to the FDA in June 2007 and expects a decision this
year, said Pfizer spokesman Francisco Gebauer. </p>
<p>Bacteria frequently mutate into forms that aren''t sensitive
to existing antibiotics. Staph bacteria typically enter the body
through a cut or scrape and cause only minor skin problems.
These can escalate into fatal bloodstream infections and
pneumonia in children, the elderly and patients whose disease-fighting immune systems are weakened. </p>
<p>''''As MRSA infections spread from the hospitals into the
community we''re seeing that the more drugs you use, the more
resistance you get,'''' said Richard Wenzel, chair of internal
medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine
in Richmond. </p>
<p>`Swiss Cheese'' </p>
<p>When 5 percent of patients stop responding to a medicine
for MRSA, hospitals need another option. ''''We''re talking about
patients who present in shock with lungs that look like Swiss
cheese,'''' said Wenzel. ''''If we keep using a drug until one in 10
people can''t take it, all we do is breed an even worse strain of
MRSA.'''' </p>
<p>The concern that medicines were breeding resistance led
doctors to reserve vancomycin for the most critical patients.
Now, vancomycin use is growing in response to more deadly germs,
and so is resistance to it. </p>
<p>''''Antibiotics like vancomycin that were kept on the shelf
for emergencies for decades are losing effectiveness and we
don''t have anything yet to replace it,'''' said Janice Reichert, a
senior research fellow at the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug
Development in Boston. </p>
<p>Theravance (THRX) Inc. of South San Francisco, California, is
seeking FDA approval for its glycopeptide called Televancin. The
agency sent the company a letter last month delaying approval by
asking how the drug is made and how the label will be worded,
analysts say. Thervance is developing the antibiotic with Tokyo-based Astellas Pharma Inc. </p>
<h2>Competitors'' Drugs </h2>
<p>Targanta Therapeutics Corp. of Cambridge, Massachusetts, is
also in the final stages of human testing for a new
glycopeptide, called oritavancin, and plans to seek FDA approval
in the first quarter of 2008. </p>
<p>New York-based Forest (FRX) Laboratories Inc. is in the final
stages of human trials with another new cephalosporin, called
ceftaroline, which the company gained from its $480 million
purchase of closely held Cerexa Inc. last year. </p>

<p>Roche Holding AG may transform
itself from the largest seller of cancer therapies to the
biggest drugmaker in the $15 billion-a-year cholesterol market
by succeeding where a Pfizer Inc. (PFE) medicine failed last year. </p>
<p>Roche will probably begin a clinical trial for regulatory
approval of a heart-disease treatment next year. The Basel,
Switzerland-based company says its candidate, called R1658,
doesn''t cause the blood-pressure increase that forced Pfizer to
terminate testing of a similar pill. The drug would head off
heart attacks by raising levels of HDL, the body''s so-called
good cholesterol. </p>
<p>Almost 50 percent of Roche''s 33.3 billion Swiss francs ($30
billion) in pharmaceutical revenue came from Avastin and tumor-fighting medicines last year, and the sales growth of one,
Herceptin for breast cancer, is slowing. A blockbuster
cholesterol treatment will keep Roche''s profit rising after
Herceptin and other older products lose patent protection. </p>
<p>''''It could be the most expensive trial Roche has ever run,
but it could be worth it as the drug has the potential to
eventually replace the sales of Avastin,'''' said Denise Anderson,
an analyst at Landsbanki Kepler in Zurich. Avastin ''''is such a
big drug that you''d need 10 normal-sized drugs, or one huge
drug, to replace it.'''' </p>
<p>Avastin brought in 1.06 billion Swiss francs in the third
quarter, when Roche''s total sales missed analyst estimates and
the company had its biggest decline in 13 months in Zurich
trading. Herceptin third-quarter revenue rose at the slowest
rate in five quarters. </p>
<h2>Share Performance </h2>
<p>Roche gained 1.4 Swiss francs to 215.5 francs in Zurich
trading. The shares have fallen about 1.4 percent this year
while Switzerland''s benchmark SMI Index of 20 companies has
risen 0.5 percent. </p>
<p>Merck  Co. (MRK) is working on a cardiac drug similar to the one
Roche is developing, and Pfizer is reviewing two new cholesterol
treatments. R1658 and its Actemra arthritis medicine are among
the most promising new drugs Roche has in development. </p>
<p>''''It''s certainly got mega-blockbuster potential,'''' Anderson
said. ''''Merck and Roche would have the market to themselves, and
that''s $15 billion for the winner.'''' </p>
<p>Lipitor, the world''s best-selling drug, with $12.9 billion
in sales last year, accounts for about 40 percent of New York-based Pfizer''s profit. Generic copies of cholesterol-fighting
Lipitor may come on the market as early as 2010 when its patent
expires. Pfizer shares have fallen about 13 percent in the past
12 months as the drugmaker has failed to find a Lipitor
replacement. </p>
<h2>Competitors Products </h2>
<p>Development (ROG) of the Roche cholesterol medicine won''t be
cheap, or without risk. Pfizer spent about $1 billion before
halting work on torcetrapib, the drug it had intended to replace
some of the revenue lost when Lipitor loses patent protection.
U.S. regulators will probably demand rigorous testing of
compounds in the unproven class called CETP inhibitors. </p>
<p>''''This could potentially be a massive market, but the
endpoints of these trials are very hard to reach,'''' said Andrew Fellows, an analyst at Helvea Ltd. in London. </p>
<p>Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, New Jersey, is still
reviewing data from Pfizer''s torcetrapib study to determine
whether it will begin the final stage of testing of anacetrapib,
spokesman Ron Rogers said in an e-mail. Pfizer has two other
CETP inhibitors in the first of three clinical trials required
for U.S. regulatory approval. The U.S. drugmaker has suspended
development of both compounds and hasn''t disclosed its plans for
the medicines, said Vanessa Aristide, a Pfizer spokesperson. </p>
<h2>Good Cholesterol </h2>
<p>CETP inhibitors block the cholesterol ester transfer
protein that turns good cholesterol into LDL, the fatty protein
that at high levels can lead to clogged arteries. The HDL form
of cholesterol is linked to a reduced incidence of heart attacks
and cardiovascular disease. </p>
<p>Roche has provided few details on the compound, licensed
from Japan Tobacco Inc. of Tokyo in 2004. The Swiss drugmaker
said last month it was leaning towards starting a phase III
trial, the last generally needed for regulatory approval. Roche
has also said results from a previous study were encouraging. </p>
<p>''''It''s got a unique chemical structure that''s different to
that of our competitors'' compounds and it''s been generally well
tolerated, which is why we think that the CETP mechanism itself
is not associated with an increase in blood pressure,'''' said
Martina Rupp, a spokeswoman at Roche. </p>
<h2>Backed by Studies </h2>
<p>Roche''s position is backed by studies reported at the
American Heart Association''s annual meeting in Orlando, Florida
earlier this month. Data showed Pfizer''s torcetrapib increased
levels of a hormone called aldosterone that may trigger fatty
plaque formation and hypertension. Merck''s medicine didn''t cause
similar increases in mice, suggesting the rise in blood pressure
wasn''t a flaw common to the whole class but one associated with
Pfizer''s compound. </p>
<p>Erik Stroes, a doctor at the Academic Medical Center in
Amsterdam involved in studies of the Roche and Pfizer drugs,
said side effects from the Swiss drugmaker''s compound were minor
to modest and centered on gastro-intestinal reactions at higher
doses. </p>
<p>''''There''s abundant evidence on the Roche CETP inhibitor and
in none of the groups studied was there a hint of increased
blood pressure,'''' Stroes added. He said there''s ''''good
rationale'''' to continue development. </p>
<p>R1658 raised good cholesterol levels by 35 to 40 percent,
compared with 60 to 80 percent for torcetrapib, according to
Stroes. The studies Stroes worked on didn''t look at survival
rates or measure either plaque levels or the thickening of
arteries in patients. Merck said last month its compound raised
HDL levels by as much as 139 percent. </p>
<h2>Late-Stage Plan </h2>
<p>Roche may try to base a late-stage trial around the drug''s
effectiveness in raising good cholesterol levels or reducing
plaque build-up, rather than its ability to prolong life, said
Karl Heinz Koch, an analyst at Bank Vontobel. Such a move could
spare the Swiss drugmaker the costs Pfizer had to shoulder and
also cut the time needed to bring the treatment to market. </p>
<p>''''It''s not $1 billion anymore because Roche is currently
discussing a more targeted program with the FDA,'''' Koch said.
''''But it''s still a big ticket for a product that doesn''t have
the validation you''d like to have at this stage''''. </p>
<p>Still, the Food and Drug Administration may insist on a
mortality study given what happened with torcetrapib, Koch said. </p>
<p>About 44 million Americans, or one in six, have low levels
of good cholesterol, which may help sweep artery-clogging LDL
out of the bloodstream, according to the American Heart
Association. About 650,000 people die in the U.S. each year from
heart disease. </p>
