&lt;p&gt;When is a hedge not a hedge? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s the question regulators from the Federal Reserve to
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are confronting
after JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) reported a $2 billion trading loss
from a credit-derivatives position Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon called a &#8220;hedge.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators are under pressure to respond to JPMorgan&#8217;s loss
as they finish writing the so-called Volcker Rule, which
restricts banks' proprietary trading and is the most
controversial provision in the Dodd-Frank Act. They&#8217;re
scrutinizing the so-called hedging exemption in the proposed
regulation and probably will narrow the exceptions for trades
banks say are designed to mitigate risk, according to two people
familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s loss &#8220;will reinforce the position of those who
want to be tough,&#8221; Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts
Democrat and co-author of the financial-overhaul legislation,
said in a telephone interview. &#8220;I do think it will mean Volcker
will not allow&#8221; such trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule, named for former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker, is
intended to reduce the chance that banks will put depositors&#8217;
money at risk. Dodd-Frank, signed into law in 2010, largely left
regulators to define the provisions, and in October, they
released a proposal for the rule, which is scheduled to take
effect in July. In April, the Fed said banks would have two
years to implement it, as long as they make a &#8220;good faith&#8221;
effort to comply with the ban on proprietary trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pool of Investments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the proposed version, bankers would be permitted to
do &#8220;risk-mitigating hedging activities&#8221; for &#8220;aggregate
positions.&#8221; That means using derivatives or other products to
reduce the risk of an entire pool of investments, as opposed to
a single transaction or position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan loss has ignited a debate whether aggregate or
portfolio hedging is appropriate at all and how to define and
spot these trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frank said he hopes regulators will prevent such positions,
allowing banks to hedge only against specific investments to
offset potential losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Aggregate hedging isn&#8217;t hedging, it&#8217;s a profit center,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;They are talking about making money out of it,&#8221; when
&#8220;hedges break even.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Skeptical Look &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of JPMorgan&#8217;s loss, regulators &#8220;clearly&#8221; are
looking &#8220;more skeptically at the claim about portfolio hedging
and what does the word &#8216;aggregate&#8217; in the law mean you have to
do,&#8221; said Karen Shaw Petrou, a managing partner at Federal
Financial Analytics, a Washington research firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street has aggressively lobbied against the Volcker
Rule. The five regulators implementing the provision received
over 17,000 comment letters -- the most for any part of the law.
Bankers devoted the majority of their efforts to aspects other
than hedging, such as allowances for trading by so-called
market-makers who buy and sell securities to establish prices
and whether banks can take positions in sovereign debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan employs 12 lobbyists and spent $7.6 million on
these activities in 2011, according to the Center for Responsive
Politics in Washington. Dimon led Wall Street bosses in a
closed-door meeting with Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo on May 2 to
press the central bank to ease regulations, including the
Volcker Rule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Public Challenge &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon publicly challenged Ben S. Bernanke in June 2011 on
tougher oversight, asking whether the Fed chairman had &#8220;a fear
like I do&#8221; that overzealous regulation &#8220;will be the reason it
took so long&#8221; for banks, credit and job creation to recover
from the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed spokeswoman Barbara Hagenbaugh declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The KBW Bank Index of 24 financial stocks has dropped 14
percent (BKX) since July 2010, the month Dodd-Frank was passed,
compared with a 16 percent gain in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
Index of stocks. JPMorgan shares have underperformed both,
tumbling 21 percent to $31.93 on June 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank lobbyists now say they&#8217;re on hold in reaction to the
attention JPMorgan has attracted. Their complaints may only
strengthen the call for tougher rules, said Oliver Ireland, a
partner at Morrison  Foerster LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The problem with this event is it doesn&#8217;t do the
industry&#8217;s credibility any good, so it&#8217;s not clear the industry
pushing a lot harder now would do any good,&#8216;&#8216; Ireland said. &#8216;&#8216;It
may create a backlash.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Egregious Mistakes&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, who asked regulators in a February letter to loosen
up their definition of portfolio hedging, said on a May 10 call
with analysts that JPMorgan&#8217;s chief investment office made
&#8216;&#8216;egregious mistakes&#8217;&#8217; by taking flawed positions on synthetic
credit. He previously pushed the unit, which oversees about $360
billion, to seek profit by speculating on higher-yielding
assets, ex-employees said in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The positions were &#8216;&#8216;done with the intention to hedge the
tail risk for JPMorgan&#8217;&#8217; and could result in an additional $1
billion loss or more as they&#8217;re wound down, Dimon said. &#8216;&#8216;But I
am telling you it morphed over time; and the new strategy, which
was meant to reduce the hedge overall, made it more complex,
more risky, and it was unbelievably ineffective.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan profited in 2011 by betting that credit conditions
would worsen. Then in December, the European Central Bank
provided long-term loans to euro-zone banks, igniting a bond
rally and leaving JPMorgan&#8217;s bearish bets vulnerable. So the
chief investment office made offsetting bullish investments
using credit-default-swap indexes that are thought to expire at
the end of 2017, according to market participants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bearish Trade &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The office put on another bearish trade to protect against
short-term losses using contracts due in 2012, market
participants said. Losses may have mounted when prices between
the two indexes became distorted because JPMorgan was such a big
seller of insurance. The trader who built the credit-derivatives
positions, Bruno Iksil, was nicknamed the &#8216;&#8216;London whale&#8217;&#8217;
because the investments became so large. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit conditions subsequently deteriorated, and hedge
funds increased purchases of the 2017 contracts, sending those
higher than the 2012 index and boosting JPMorgan&#8217;s losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s investments can&#8217;t &#8216;&#8216;be described in any way
as a hedge,&#8221; Michael Platt, co-founder and CEO of BlueCrest
Capital Management LLP, said in a May 21 interview with
Bloomberg Television. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s a trading loss. They
deliberately put the positions on. The London whale, who has
subsequently been harpooned, put the positions on.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geneva-based BlueCrest manages $32 billion and took a
&#8220;small&#8221; position against JPMorgan, Platt said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gone Too Far &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Gary Gensler and U.S. Securities  Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro both acknowledged May 22 the difficulty regulators face
in allowing some risk-mitigating hedging and then trying to
determine when it&#8217;s gone too far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The challenge when somebody uses a word like &#8216;portfolio
hedging&#8217; is that it can mutate and morph into many things beyond
hedging specific positions,&#8221; Gensler said May 21, 10 days
before the CFTC held a round-table discussion about narrowing
exemptions in the Volcker Rule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An administration official told reporters on May 22 that
regulators will use the JPMorgan loss as a real-life example to
inform the final rule. Regulators feel pressure to react and
will scrutinize the hedging exemption, according to another
person who works for an agency involved in the writing of the
law who wasn&#8217;t authorized to speak publicly and declined to be
identified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unpopular Regulations &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More stringent regulations are sure to be unpopular with
bankers. &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t want to make a big change based on one
event,&#8221; said Tim Ryan, president and CEO of the Securities
Industry and Financial Markets Association, Wall Street&#8217;s main
lobbying group. &#8220;This is a complicated proposal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers are using JPMorgan&#8217;s loss for &#8220;political
expediency,&#8221; and it&#8217;s unlikely that portfolio hedging actually
will be banned, predicted Douglas Landy, a partner at Allen 
Overy LLP in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks do need the ability to mitigate risks in their
portfolio using derivatives, said Ernest Patrikis, a partner at
White  Case LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s insanity to think that they shouldn&#8217;t be doing it,&#8221;
said Patrikis, former general counsel at the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York. Regulators may consider options such as
forcing financial institutions to &#8220;demonstrate more fully&#8221;
their positions or restricting how they can hedge, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prohibit Trades &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Stability Oversight Council, created by Dodd-Frank and led by Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner,
discussed JPMorgan&#8217;s loss and the Volcker Rule at a May 22
meeting, Treasury spokesman Anthony Coley said. It&#8217;s
&#8220;premature&#8221; to conclude whether the rule &#8220;would have
prohibited these trades and the hedging activity&#8221; the bank
conducted, Bryan Hubbard, a spokesman for the comptroller&#8217;s
office, said May 14 in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senators Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, and Carl Levin,
a Michigan Democrat, who co-wrote the Volcker provision, said
JPMorgan&#8217;s trading losses underline why hedging on a portfolio
basis should be barred in the final version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pressure from lobbyists during the rule-making process
gave rise to regulatory loopholes that would allow proprietary
trading to be hidden within market-making, risk-mitigating
hedging and wealth management, among other areas,&#8221; the senators
said in a May 17 letter to the Fed and other regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate Banking Committee has begun hearings on JPMorgan
and its implications for regulatory changes. The bank regulators
and Neal Wolin, Treasury Department deputy secretary, will
testify on June 6; Dimon will testify June 13. Dimon also will
appear before the House Financial Services Committee on June 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main impact of JPMorgan&#8217;s sour trades will be to speed
up work on finalizing the Volcker rule, said Brian Gardner,
senior vice president in Washington at investment bank Keefe
Bruyette  Woods Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators &#8220;are under the gun to finish&#8221; in a way that is
&#8220;totally unreasonable, which is to make sure there are no
losses at banks,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They&#8217;ve basically been assigned
mission impossible.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walton Street Capital LLC, a real
estate private-equity firm, is poised to hand back to lenders a
portfolio of West Coast industrial properties, Crain&#8217;s Chicago
reported without say how it obtained the information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walton Street, whose managing principal is billionaire Neil Bluhm, bought the properties for $2.9 billion at the peak of the
real estate market in 2007, Crain&#8217;s reported today. About $2.5
billion of loans on the Chicago-based firm&#8217;s portfolio come due
June 8, and the properties are worth so much less than the debt
that it makes sense to walk away, the newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackstone Group LP (BX), the world&#8217;s largest private-equity
firm, has acquired almost $600 million of debt on the buildings,
putting it in a position to take control if the borrower
defaults. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surrender comes just Walton Street is trying to raise
$2 billion for its seventh and largest fund, Crain&#8217;s reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iraq and Chevron Phillips Chemical
Co., a joint venture of Chevron Corp. (CVX) and ConocoPhillips (COP), signed
a letter of intent to evaluate the feasibility of developing a
petrochemical plant in the country, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company would examine building a new facility and
upgrading an existing Iraq-owned petrochemicals factory in
southern Basra province, Hanaa al-Husseini, a spokeswoman for
the Industry and Minerals Ministry, said today in Baghdad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melanie Samuelson, a spokeswoman for Chevron Philips, said
in an e-mailed statement that the company, with headquarters in
The Woodlands, Texas, wants to assess &#8220;the feasibility of
developing an integrated petrochemical complex.&#8221; Both Chevron
Phillips and the ministry declined to give additional details,
including cost estimates or dates for the project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq holds the world&#8217;s fifth-largest crude reserves and the
fifth-biggest natural-gas deposits in the Middle East, according
to data from BP Plc that also include Canadian oil sands. The
government, which depends on crude sales for more than 90
percent of its official income, wants to diversify into
chemicals production and other industries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq&#8217;s oil output is on the rebound after stagnating for
years during the rule of Saddam Hussein, ousted by a U.S.-led
invasion in 2003. The nation burns off natural gas produced in
association with crude because it lacks the infrastructure to
use it as a fuel for electricity plants or feedstock for
petrochemicals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ministry&#8217;s al-Husseini said April 9 that Shell
Chemicals Ltd. agreed in a separate arrangement to study the
feasibility of a petrochemical plant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank, may report a $4.2 billion second-quarter trading loss
in its chief investment office, according to an estimate by
International Strategy  Investment Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pretax loss would help cut second-quarter earnings to
65 cents a share, a 30 percent decline from an earlier estimate
of 93 cents, Ed Najarian, an ISI analyst, said in a note
yesterday. Weaker-than-expected trading and investment banking
revenue coupled with mark-to-market private-equity losses will
also weigh on results, Najarian said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56, said last
month the firm lost about $2 billion on trades conducted at its
CIO unit, which is charged with managing the bank&#8217;s idle cash to
earn a profit while minimizing risk. Dimon has said losses could
grow and it might take the rest of the year to liquidate the New
York-based lender&#8217;s trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loss will be &#8220;partially offset&#8221; by $2 billion in
realized security gains, stronger mortgage-banking revenue and
so-called debt-valuation adjustments, Najarian wrote. Excluding
the trading losses, DVA and securities gains, Najarian estimates
second quarter operating earnings per share of 82 cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Najarian cut his 12-month price target to $47 a share, from
$52, and kept a rating of &#8220;buy&#8221; on the stock. JPMorgan fell
2.9 percent yesterday to $31 and is down 6.8 percent this year.
Kristin Lemkau, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) expanded the sports
and entertainment content offered through the Xbox, adding shows
like &#8220;Monday Night Football&#8221; to extend the life of its gaming
console and step up competition with Sony Corp. (6758) and Nintendo Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Xbox 360&#8217;s online service will gain 35 entertainment
providers, Yusuf Mehdi, chief marketing officer for Microsoft&#8217;s
Interactive Entertainment division, said today at the E3 trade
show in Los Angeles. Microsoft also introduced an application
called Xbox SmartGlass that will link the console to phones,
tablets and personal computers from Microsoft and rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is seeking to turn Xbox into a home-entertainment
system that lets consumers share programs and information with
all their devices, both competing with and connecting to gadgets
from Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG) Microsoft doesn&#8217;t plan to unveil
a new console until next year at the earliest, people familiar
with the matter said in March, so SmartGlass and the added
programming will help refresh the Xbox amid competition from
Sony&#8217;s PlayStation 3 and a new Nintendo console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a smart move,&#8221; said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst
at Gartner Inc. &#8220;It positions Xbox as the center of a personal
cloud ecosystem while allowing consumers to preserve the value
in their current hardware.&#8221; Customers will probably be able to
use the SmartGlass app on existing iPads and iPhones, for
example, Gartenberg said, citing a briefing from Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SmartGlass App &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s biggest software maker, will release
SmartGlass this year, allowing content makers to create uses for
the app. For example, HBO could use it to provide &#8220;Game of
Thrones&#8221; information to a viewer&#8217;s tablet while he or she is
watching, or Electronic Arts Inc. could let &#8220;Madden NFL&#8221;
video-game players draw a new play for their running back on
their phone and have the player execute it in the game, Mehdi
said in an interview before the speech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app will also serve to provide additional uses for
Windows Phones and Windows 8 tablets and PCs, scheduled to go on
sale later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new content, games and programs serve to round out
Microsoft&#8217;s vision of Xbox as entertainment hub, as Google and
Apple try to market television products and Sony and Nintendo
approach the market through their game consoles. Nintendo has
already announced a new machine, the Wii U, set to go on sale
later this year. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said today
that Xbox is now the best-selling video-game machine worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Console Market &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has made market-share gains in a slumping U.S.
video-game and console market. The company racked up more than
40 percent of U.S. console sales for 14 months straight through
April, according to market researcher NPD Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that month, U.S. sales of video-game hardware, software
and accessories tumbled 32 percent as consumer buying shifts to
downloads and games on social sites, said Port Washington, New
York-based NPD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At a time when entertainment is becoming more
interactive, more fun, we are bringing together games, movies
and television shows on every screen in our lives,&#8221; said Don Mattrick, president of Microsoft&#8217;s Interactive Entertainment
division, in a speech at E3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft rose less than 1 percent to $28.55 at the close
in New York. The shares have gained 10 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Viacom, Univision &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New content for Xbox Live, which has 40 million
subscribers, will include Paramount films and Nickelodeon
cartoons from Viacom Inc. (VIAB), shows from Spanish-language
broadcaster Univision Communications Inc., 24-hour ESPN
programming and National Basketball Association games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NBA League Pass will be available on Xbox Live for a fee,
giving customers more than 2,400 games, Mehdi said. A National
Hockey League subscription package offers more than 40 games a
week, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nike Inc. (NKE) will release a fitness game that uses Xbox and
its Kinect sensor to scan a customer&#8217;s body -- it can even tell
if the user has had knee surgery -- and recommends a workout
plan. The Kinect will then track whether the user is doing the
exercises correctly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today also demonstrated &#8220;Halo 4,&#8221; the next
installment in best-selling Xbox-only game franchise, which is
due to be available this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the company showed an Xbox Music service that
is a revamped version of its Zune offering. The service will
offer 30 million tracks that can be accessed on any Microsoft
device. The company will also offer an Internet Explorer browser
for Xbox. &lt;/p&gt;

its equipment in an increasingly paperless world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lexmark&#8217;s bonds and credit-default swaps tied to its debt
imply the market perceives a credit rating of Ba1, according to
Moody&#8217;s Corp.&#8217;s capital markets research group, compared with
its actual rating at Moody&#8217;s Investors Service of Baa3. The
swaps have surged to the highest level since 2009, according to
prices compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The perception of creditworthiness of Lexmark, spun off in
1991 by International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), which Standard 
Poor&#8217;s upgraded to AA- from A+ on May 30, is deteriorating as
investors grow leery of its prospects. The Lexington, Kentucky-based company is trying to become a provider of corporate
printer services and document management, a strategy that hasn&#8217;t
paid off as the decline in its traditional business outweighs
contributions from new areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Lexmark is in a mature-to-declining industry with a
weakening position, which is pressuring profitability,&#8221; said
Joel Levington, managing director of corporate credit at
Brookfield Investment Management Inc. in New York. &#8220;I
personally do not believe the business is worthy of investment-grade status.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Default Swaps &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit markets agree. Swaps on the company&#8217;s debt have
surged since April, adding 92 basis points to 338 basis points
today, Bloomberg prices show. That means investors would pay
$338,000 annually to protect $10 million of Lexmark&#8217;s debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contracts have jumped 149 basis points since June 1,
2011. Credit swaps, which typically fall as investor confidence
improves and rise as it deteriorates, pay the buyer face value
if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the value of
the defaulted debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lexmark&#8217;s $300 million of 6.65 percent bonds due June 2018,
which traded as high as 115 cents on the dollar in April, have
fallen to 112.1 cents on the dollar where they yield 4.34
percent, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s closer to the 4.46 percent Bloomberg Fair Market
yield for seven-year, BB rated industrial bonds than the 3.19
percent on BBB- debt of that maturity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Free Cash &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bonds&#8217; implied Baa3 grade matched the Moody&#8217;s rating
through May 24. SP rates the debt BBB-, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which has sold printers to consumers through
retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Best Buy Co. and Target
Corp., is trying to develop a managed print services business,
contracts under which it provides all the printing needs of a
corporation or government agency. That strategy made for a
&#8220;mixed&#8221; year in 2011 for Lexmark, according to Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While the company has developed a healthy and growing
managed print services business and begun to diversify into
software, its inkjet business has continued to struggle and its
financial results have been undermined by continued decline in
its legacy supplies business,&#8221; Sacconaghi said on a conference
call from the Sanford C. Bernstein Strategic Decisions
Conference on May 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a bit of a headwind we&#8217;re fighting as far as getting
overall growth,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer Paul Rooke said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;We&#8217;ve come a long way from where we
were.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lexmark&#8217;s leverage, as measured by the ratio of its debt to
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
was 0.98 times at the end of the first quarter, down from 1.47
times at the end of June 2009, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cash Dwindles &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cash and marketable securities fell $200 million from the
end of 2011 to $949 million because of acquisitions. The company
has about $650 million of long-term debt, with $350 million
maturing in 2013 and the rest in 2018, Bloomberg data show.
Lexmark&#8217;s revenue is expected to fall to $4 billion in 2012 and
$3.9 billion next year from $4.17 billion in 2011, according to
the average estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lexmark was the printer division of IBM until 1991, when it
sold the unit for $1.5 billion to Clayton Dubilier  Rice LLC,
according to Hoover&#8217;s Inc. Clayton Dubilier sold it to the
public at $20 a share in 1995, valuing the company at $1.78
billion, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, which has been emphasizing software and services over
hardware, was upgraded at SP because of its shift to these
&#8220;more stable and higher margin&#8221; businesses, SP&#8217;s analyst
Martha Toll-Reed said in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Returning Cash &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lexmark plans to return more than half of free cash flow to
shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, Rooke said
in a conference call from the Sanford C. Bernstein Strategic
Decisions Conference with analysts on May 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lexmark gave $268 million back to shareholders last year
via stock purchases and dividends, more than its $234.5 million
of free cash flow, and in the first quarter this year
repurchased $30 million of shares and paid a dividend of 25
cents a share, or about $18 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free cash not destined for shareholder rewards will be used
to &#8220;invest for growth, both organically and with a focus on
acquisitions to drive long-term shareholder value,&#8221; Rooke said
on the conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Strategic Shift&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s shares dropped 6.5 percent on April 24 to
$30.44 after it reported quarterly adjusted earnings of 84 cents
a share, lower than the $1.08 average analyst estimate in a
Bloomberg survey. The stock has erased 24 percent of its market
capitalization this year, closing at $24.98 on June 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Lexmark is in the midst of a strategic shift to higher
usage workgroup printers and more profitable supplies sales,
but, in our opinion, the company remains vulnerable to economic
cycles and pricing pressure,&#8221; Toll-Reed and Philip Schrank,
another SP analyst, wrote in an April 30 note affirming the
company&#8217;s BBB- rating and &#8220;stable&#8221; outlook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysts wrote the outlook would be &#8220;negative&#8221; if
Lexmark&#8217;s profitability consistently declines or if its
financial policies become more aggressive, &#8220;with sustained
leverage in excess of the low&#8221; 2 times areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business outside the U.S. accounted for 57.9 percent of
Lexmark&#8217;s revenue last year, with 37 percent coming from Europe,
the Middle East and Africa, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard Co., the world&#8217;s largest personal-computer
maker, is consolidating its PC and printer business, and the
Palo Alto, California-based company will look to reclaim market
share Lexmark gained, according to Mark Moskowitz, a San
Francisco-based analyst at JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As global growth slows as consumers and governments cut
spending to stem Europe&#8217;s sovereign debt crisis, competition
will heat up, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In an environment where we could be setting up for
another macro tailspin, you can bet for sure that printing is
going back to the bottom rung,&#8221; Moskowitz said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;Within six to nine months, you&#8217;re going to hear
about a bloodbath in printing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An intensifying financial crisis in
Spain or elsewhere in Europe has the potential to drive American
stocks into a bear market, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s chief U.S.
equity strategist said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While David Kostin&#8217;s mid-year forecast for the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 Index calls for a 3.7 percent gain from last week&#8217;s
close to 1,325, he said the measure may fall to 1,125 should the
situation in Europe worsen. That would give the SP 500 a more-than 20 percent loss since its 2012 closing peak of 1,419.04. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The June 1 report from Goldman Sachs said the most likely
scenario is Greek elections result in the nation remaining in
the euro zone. Concern it will leave has helped drag the SP 500
down 10 percent since April 2, including the biggest monthly
decline since September. &#8220;Financial contagion or crisis in
Spain&#8221; could prompt a bear market drop of 20 percent, according
to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs also predicted a Greek exit from the euro
zone area could push the Stoxx Europe 600 Index down a further
3.8 percent to 225 and a policy response considered not credible
or bank disruptions in other countries may send the European
gauge to its 2009 low of 158. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Oppenheimer, the London-based chief global equity
strategist at Goldman Sachs, reduced his three-month forecast
for the Stoxx Europe 600 by 5.8 percent to 245 last week. The
European measure slid 0.5 percent to 233.87 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Three Events &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kostin said investors face three upcoming macro events that
may add uncertainty: the second round of Greek elections on June
17, the Federal Open Market Committee&#8217;s June meeting and the
U.S. Supreme Court&#8217;s ruling on health-care reform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 has found &#8220;valuation support&#8221; around 11 times
estimated earnings in previous crises, according to Kostin. The
measure has not remained lower than a multiple of 11 for longer
than a month since the late 1980s, including during October 2008
and September 2011, he said. The U.S. index currently trades at
12.1 times analysts&#8217; projected profits in the next year, while
the Stoxx Europe has a multiple of 9.7, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc&#8217;s Barry Knapp predicts the SP 500 may fall to
between 1,100 and 1,200 based on historic equity risk premium
levels, which looks at forward earnings yield minus the real 10-year Treasury (USGG10YR) yield. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Quite Significant&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmark gauge erased as much as 16 percent and 19
percent in 2010 and 2011 respectively as economic data weakened
and investor concern about a double-dip recession grew. A Labor
Department report last week showed payrolls climbed by 69,000
last month, less than the most-pessimistic forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey, after a revised 77,000 gain in April. Two
months of payroll gains below 100,000 &#8220;significantly&#8221; boosts
the likelihood of a third consecutive double-dip scare,
according to Knapp&#8217;s report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is little room for optimism in this morning&#8217;s
report,&#8221; Knapp, the New York-based head of equity strategy,
wrote in the June 1 note after the release of the payrolls data.
&#8220;Although the equity market has cheapened considerably, it is
not close to last year&#8217;s levels from a risk premium perspective
and if the uptrend in the equity risk premium continues, the
market&#8217;s fall may be quite significant.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The friendship between Rajat Gupta, a
former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) director, and Galleon Group LLC
founder Raj Rajaratnam took center stage this morning at Gupta&#8217;s
insider-trading trial, as prosecutors prepared to summon Goldman
Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein to testify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein will testify as a government witness today, U.S.
District Judge Jed Rakoff said during a break in the testimony.
Blankfein, who was scheduled to testify on June 6, will take the
stand this afternoon because of a scheduling conflict with his
daughter&#8217;s graduation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment on Blankfein&#8217;s testimony or his schedule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors concluded their questioning of Anil Kumar, a
former McKinsey  Co. partner, who told jurors in Manhattan
federal court about the friendship between Gupta and Rajaratnam.
Kumar said Gupta had invested $10 million in the Galleon Voyager
Fund in 2008, Rajaratnam invested $40 million, and the two
borrowed $300 million from Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. for the
fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He said that the $10 million had almost doubled in size
over the years,&#8221; Kumar said of Gupta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, the fund was wiped out in the 2008 stock market
collapse, angering Gupta and prompting him to consider filing a
lawsuit because of what he said was Rajaratnam&#8217;s mismanagement
of the fund, Kumar said. The litigation threat didn&#8217;t come up
until 2009, which was after Gupta allegedly provided illegal
tips to Rajaratman, Kumar said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Moral&#8217; Responsibility &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Gupta said Mr. Rajaratnam had an ethical and moral
responsibility to Mr. Gupta because he had not held up to his
side of the management of the fund,&#8221; Kumar said of Gupta&#8217;s
comments to him in 2009. &#8220;Since Mr. Rajaratnam had lost all the
money, Mr. Rajaratnam had a moral and ethical responsibility to
make Mr. Gupta whole.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta, who ran McKinsey  Co. from 1994 to 2003, is on
trial for leaking tips about Goldman Sachs and Procter  Gamble
Co. (PG), where he was also a director. One of the alleged tips
involved a Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/B) investment in Goldman Sachs.
Prosecutors say Gupta tipped Rajaratnam after learning about the
deal in a Goldman Sachs board meeting at 3:55 p.m. on Sept. 23,
2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam and Gupta are the biggest figures caught in a
nationwide insider-trading probe. Gupta, who has pleaded not
guilty, is charged with conspiracy and securities fraud, which
carries a maximum 20-year prison sentence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Motive &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On cross-examination of Kumar, defense attorney Gary Naftalis sought to show that there wasn&#8217;t a close relationship
between the two men, suggesting that Gupta had no motive to leak
inside tips to Rajaratnam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kumar testified, under questioning from Naftalis, that
Gupta didn&#8217;t attend Rajaratnam&#8217;s 50th birthday celebration in
Kenya and that Gupta&#8217;s attention was focused primarily on the
Indian School of Business, which Gupta and Kumar co-founded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defense has pointed to Gupta&#8217;s threat to sue over the
losses in the Voyager Fund as a reason why he wouldn&#8217;t leak
inside information to Rajaratnam in 2008. In cross-examination,
Kumar testified that Gupta had complained in 2008, before the
2009 lawsuit threat, that Rajaratnam had &#8220;dropped the ball&#8221; in
managing the fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He&#8217;s generally a calm guy,&#8221; Kumar said of Gupta. &#8220;That&#8217;s
quite a bit of money to lose.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta eventually concluded that Rajaratnam had taken money
out of the Voyager account without telling him, Kumar said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He was very annoyed,&#8221; Kumar testified. &#8220;He told me he
was about to sue Mr. Rajaratnam.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Gupta, 11-cr-00907, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s non-manufacturing industries
expanded at the slowest pace in more than a year, as export
orders declined and weakness in real estate countered strength
in retailing and leasing, an official survey indicated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchasing managers&#8217; index fell to 55.2 in May from
56.1 in April, the National Bureau of Statistics and China
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said yesterday in
Beijing. That&#8217;s the lowest reading since March 2011 when the
federation started seasonally adjusting the data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report adds to evidence that the world&#8217;s second-biggest
economy is weakening as Europe&#8217;s debt crisis crimps demand and
government curbs on the property market feed through to more
industries. JPMorgan Chase  Co. has cut its full-year economic
growth forecast for China twice in a month and now estimates an
expansion of 7.7 percent, down from 9.2 percent in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The data reinforce the message that the slowdown has
spread from the manufacturing sector to the services sector,&#8221;
said Tim Condon, chief Asia economist at ING Financial Markets
in Singapore. &#8220;The current slowdown is more complicated to read
than the 2008 global financial crisis and is stressing the
authorities&#8217; vaunted fine-tuning skills.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asian stocks dropped after the services data and a U.S.
payrolls report that showed fewer jobs added to the American
economy than forecast. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slid 2.2% as
of 12:13 p.m. Tokyo time. Japan&#8217;s Topix fell below the lowest
level seen during the 2008-2009 financial crisis and headed for
its weakest close since December 1983. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Very Bad Condition&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The overall external economy is in a very bad condition,
and it is very unlikely to change in the short term,&#8221; Hong Kong
Financial Secretary John Tsang told lawmakers today. &#8220;If Greece
exits the euro-zone, it will bring a tremendous impact to the
European, as well as the global economy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China retains confidence in the euro even with the large
uncertainties in the region, central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan said in an interview with China Business News. The 
publication didn&#8217;t say when the interview was conducted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The uncertainties surrounding the exit of Greece from the
euro area and the sovereign debt crisis in peripheral countries
have intensified substantially,&#8221; JPMorgan analysts said in a
note dated June 1. The risk is &#8220;a significant drag&#8221; on China&#8217;s
economic recovery, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An index of euro area investor confidence is due to be
released today, along with unemployment figures for Spain, a
nation at the center of the region's concerns after a jump in 
its borrowing costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. may announce today that orders to factories
increased in April after a decline in March, according to a
Bloomberg News survey of economists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chinese Data &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Service industries now account for 43 percent of the
Chinese economy, the federation said in yesterday&#8217;s statement.
That compares with almost 90 percent in the U.S. The government
aims to raise the share to 47 percent by 2015, according to a
Xinhua news agency report on May 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The services PMI doesn&#8217;t have as much sway with investors
as the manufacturing data, as &#8220;it&#8217;s a new series, so its
tracking ability is still uncertain,&#8221; Condon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Chinese manufacturing index had the weakest reading in
five months in May, statistics bureau and logistics federation
data last week showed, helping push Brent crude below $100 a
barrel for the first time in almost eight months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 50.4 reading for May was near the 50 mark that divides
expansion from contraction and compared with a 52.0 median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 27 economists. A separate
gauge from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics released the
same day showed a seventh straight contraction, the longest
since the global financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Weak Momentum &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manufacturing surveys present &#8220;clear signs of weak
economic growth momentum,&#8221; China International Capital Corp.
analysts led by Beijing-based Peng Wensheng said in a June 1
note. &#8220;The National Development and Reform Commission has
recently expedited project approvals but whether this can
effectively stabilize investment and GDP growth still depends on
monetary and credit policies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economists forecast two to three more cuts in banks&#8217;
reserve requirements this year and say a reduction in benchmark
lending rates is likely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Premier Wen Jiabao and the State Council, or Cabinet,
warned last month that the economy faces increasing downward
pressure. They pledged to put a greater focus on growth and
&#8220;actively&#8221; raise domestic demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government announced new subsidies to boost sales of
energy-saving household appliances including refrigerators and
washing machines after the expiry of a previous program last
year. Gome Electrical Appliances Holding Ltd. (493), China&#8217;s second-
biggest electronics retailer, said May 25 its first-quarter net
income slumped 88 percent from a year earlier as the end of the
incentives led to a drop in consumer demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Growth Slowdown &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government is also stepping up approvals for
infrastructure and corporate investment projects to counter the
economic slowdown that Credit Suisse Group AG estimates will
push growth down to 7 percent or &#8220;slightly below&#8221; this quarter
compared with a year earlier. Expansion moderated to 8.1 percent
in the first three months of the year, the fifth straight
quarterly slowdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Development and Reform Commission said on May
25 it gave Baosteel Group Corp., the parent of China&#8217;s largest
listed steelmaker, approval for an $11 billion plant more than
seven years after the project was conceived. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steel industry fundamentals are &#8220;likely to deteriorate in
2012,&#8221; weighing on the credit quality of Baosteel, Nippon Steel
Corp. (5401) and Posco (005490), Standard and Poor&#8217;s said in a research report
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The non-manufacturing PMI is based on a survey of about
1,200 companies covering 27 industries including construction,
transport and telecommunications. The federation and statistics
bureau started publishing a seasonally adjusted index for the
non-manufacturing PMI from the March survey, and revised
readings back to March 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A separate services industries gauge will be released by
HSBC and Markit tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Craig Torres" date="Jun 05, 2012  7:12 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-05/tarullo-says-fed-helping-in-oversight-of-jpmorgan-portfolio.html"><headline>Tarullo Says Fed Helping Oversight of JPMorgan Portfolio</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo said the central bank is helping oversee JPMorgan Chase
 Co.&#8217;s management of a portfolio that lost $2 billion in a
credit-derivatives position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Federal Reserve has been assisting in the oversight
of JPMorgan&#8217;s efforts to manage and de-risk the portfolio,&#8221;
Tarullo said in comments prepared for testimony tomorrow before
the Senate Banking Committee in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has been under tougher regulatory scrutiny since
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said May 10 that the firm&#8217;s
chief investment office suffered the loss. He later called it
&#8220;a Risk 101 mistake.&#8221; Regulator probes began after traders in
the London office, which manages the bank&#8217;s excess cash, made
wrong-way bets on illiquid credit derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of the New York-based company have fallen about 21
percent since May 10, and several federal agencies, including
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency, are looking into the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tarullo said the Fed anticipates working with the OCC and
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. &#8220;to identify the changes in
risk measurement, management and governance that will be
necessary to improve risk-control practices surrounding the
firm&#8217;s trading activities and to address trading strategies that
led to these losses.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fed Looking &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Federal Reserve has been looking at other parts of
the holding company to determine if governance, risk management
and control weaknesses -- similar to those exposed by this
incident -- are present elsewhere,&#8221; he said, adding that the
Fed&#8217;s review is not yet complete. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tarullo, a former law professor and aide to President Bill Clinton, is the Fed&#8217;s lead governor on bank supervision. Since
taking office in January 2009, he has overhauled the Fed&#8217;s bank
oversight and piloted the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act,
the most sweeping change to financial regulation since the
1930s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed governor has also sharpened the central bank&#8217;s
focus on the largest U.S. financial institutions with stress
tests, capital plan reviews, and the creation of the Large
Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee, a multi-
disciplinary task force that draws on the central bank&#8217;s
economists and quantitative analysts to hunt down systemic risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LISCC &#8220; also has focused its attention on potential
implications for financial stability in the United States from
stresses arising in Europe,&#8221; Tarullo said in his remarks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Capital Buffers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tarullo emphasized that large banks must maintain
sufficient capital buffers to absorb losses, and limit their
risk to the overall financial system to avoid a repeat of the
financial crisis that he said was the worst since the 1930s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is critical that we complete the implementation of
capital and other prudential measures to prevent another crisis
and protect taxpayers from having again to recapitalize
financial firms,&#8221; he said. The economic recovery &#8220;is far from
complete,&#8221; he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed governor has used the stress tests and capital plan
reviews as a goad to assure banks balance dividend payments and
stock buybacks with plans to boost and maintain capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The best way to safeguard against taxpayer-funded
bailouts in the future is for our large financial institutions
to have capital buffers commensurate with their own risk
profiles and the damage that would be done to the financial
system if such institutions were to fail,&#8221; Tarullo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;High-Quality Capital&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said &#8220;recent events&#8221; are a reminder that &#8220;substantial
amounts of high-quality capital is the best way to ensure that
significant losses at individual firms are borne by their
shareholders, and not by depositors or taxpayers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 19 largest banks participating in these exams have
increased their tier one common capital levels to $759 billion
in the fourth quarter of last year from $420 billion in the
first quarter of 2009. That raised the ratio of capital to risk-
weighted assets to 10.4 percent from 5.4 percent. The biggest
banks paid out 15 of net income in common dividends in 2011
compared with a payout of 38 percent net income in 2006,
according to the Fed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s trading loss
of more than $2 billion raises &#8220;questions about the adequacy
and rigor&#8221; of the bank&#8217;s risk-management practices, according
to U.S. Comptroller of the Currency Thomas J. Curry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OCC, JPMorgan&#8217;s prudential regulator, is &#8220;actively
examining&#8221; the New York-based bank, which disclosed the losses
from its chief investment office on May 10, Curry said in
remarks prepared for a Senate Banking Committee hearing
tomorrow. The agency has learned that the bank&#8217;s position
&#8220;deteriorated rapidly&#8221; at the end of April and during the
first days of May, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Since that time, the OCC has been meeting daily with bank
management with respect to the bank&#8217;s response to this
situation, to re-evaluate the risk-management activities and
controls of the bank and how they applied to its CIO function,
and to determine what additional action is necessary,&#8221; Curry
said in his statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hearing will be the first public airing of the roles
played by the OCC, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. and the Treasury Department in the period before
JPMorgan Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon
disclosed the trading losses tied to credit derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Tim Johnson, the South Dakota Democrat who leads
the committee, said the session will give lawmakers a chance to
probe the losses at the biggest and most profitable U.S. bank.
It may also provide a preview of the panel&#8217;s scheduled June 13
hearing with Dimon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Volcker Rule &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OCC is &#8220;not drawing any conclusions&#8221; about whether
the trading that led to the losses would have violated the so-
called Volcker rule, which would ban proprietary trading by
banks that benefit from FDIC deposit insurance and Fed
borrowing. JPMorgan&#8217;s disclosure has heightened tension around
the Dodd-Frank Act measure being crafted by regulators, with
congressional Democrats and consumer groups saying the loss
shows the need for tougher restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s premature to reach any conclusion based upon the
facts and information as they currently exist,&#8221; Curry said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final Volcker rule should prohibit activity, including
hedging, that &#8220;does not reduce risks related to specific
individual or aggregate positions held by a firm,&#8221; Treasury
Deputy Secretary Neal Wolin said in his prepared remarks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan loss goes beyond the rule named for former Fed
Chairman Paul Volcker, Wolin said. It shows the need for banks&#8217;
senior managers to have effective risk models and accountability
for failure, and for regulators to have clear understanding of
banks&#8217; exposures and risk-management systems, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ultimately, the true test of reform is not whether it
prevents firms from taking risks or from making mistakes, but
whether our financial regulatory system is tough enough and
designed well to prevent those mistakes from hurting the broader
economy or costing taxpayers money,&#8221; Wolin said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
has ended its information-technology sponsorship of the National
Football League because of differing views over how the
partnership should be handled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We determined that our respective views on how the NFL
should manage the IT sponsorship were too different and we
decided not to renew our agreement,&#8221; said Chris Andrews, a
spokesman for IBM. &#8220;All discussions were amicable and we remain
on very positive terms with the NFL, and there is no reason why
we wouldn&#8217;t consider advertising on NFL games in the future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, based in Armonk, New York, had served as the NFL&#8217;s
technology sponsor since 2003, a deal that included consulting
and data-center management. The decision to end the arrangement,
which expired in March, followed months of negotiations, Andrews
said. The NFL move doesn&#8217;t affect IBM&#8217;s other sponsorships, he
said, without elaborating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also is one of three sponsors of the Masters
tournament held at Augusta National Golf Club, the subject of
criticism over its male-only membership policy. In January,
Ginni Rometty became the first female chief executive officer at
IBM, which has declined to comment on future Masters&#8217;
sponsorship plans. The past four IBM CEOs have been invited to
be Augusta National members, and the current CEOs of other
Masters sponsors, Exxon Mobil Corp. and ATT Inc., are members. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s NFL sponsorship decision was reported earlier by the
Sports Business Journal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility, the mobile-phone maker that&#8217;s now part
of Google Inc., also ended its sponsorship deal with the NFL
this year, following more than a decade. The company&#8217;s brand had
appeared on the headsets worn by coaches on the sidelines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;After careful thought and consideration, Motorola
Mobility determined that it is in the company&#8217;s best interest
not to renew our sponsorship,&#8221; Juli Burda, a spokeswoman for
the company, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS), aiming to combat
childhood obesity by banning junk-food ads, will require that
food and beverage advertising to kids on its TV networks and
radio stations meet new nutritional standards by 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guidelines, which follow federal recommendations, are
designed to promote fruits and vegetables, limit calories, and
curb the intake of saturated fat, salt and sugar, Burbank,
California-based Disney said in a statement. By the end of this
year, food products will begin bearing the &#8220;Mickey Check&#8221;
logo, signaling that they meet the standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effort, announced today at an event with first lady
Michelle Obama, expands on Disney&#8217;s adoption of nutritional
guidelines in 2006. Disney is the world&#8217;s largest entertainment
company, with holdings that include film studios, theme parks,
radio stations and the ABC broadcast network. The company&#8217;s
media networks generated $7.6 billion in advertising revenue in
its most recent fiscal year, an increase of 8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guidelines give specific standards. Breakfast cereals,
for example, should have no more than 130 calories and fewer
than 10 grams of sugar per ounce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney was the first major media company to set nutrition
guidelines for licensed food products and taking this next step
is &#8220;a win for us, a win for food companies, and a big win for
families,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger said at the
Washington event. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is preparing to
release its first-ever version of its Office software for Apple
Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s mobile devices this year, according to two people with
knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software will make the word-processing program Word and
spreadsheet-maker Excel available on Apple&#8217;s iPad tablets and
iPhones, said the people, who requested anonymity because the
product hasn&#8217;t been made public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding Office software onto the iPad is key to Microsoft&#8217;s
growth, particularly in the corporate market. IPads accounted
for 97 percent of tablets bought by businesses in the first
quarter, according to a survey of users by Good Technology Inc.,
a maker of wireless-device security technology. Devices that run
Microsoft software and compete with the iPad won&#8217;t be
available until later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software could either be preloaded on some devices or
sold as an application at Apple&#8217;s App Store. There will be
competition: The top-grossing app last Christmas was Google
Inc.&#8217;s Quickoffice, a productivity tool for viewing and editing
Office documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another app, CloudOn, which lets consumers use Word, Excel
and PowerPoint on tablets, has had more than 1 million
downloads, and raised about $10 million in venture capital,
CloudOn Inc. Chief Executive Officer Milind Gadekar said in an
interview. The startup has always expected Microsoft to come out
with its own version of Office for tablets and hopes to win
customers with extra features, Gadekar said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tablet sales will climb 85 percent to 126.6 million units
this year, according to IHS iSuppli Research. IPads accounted
for two of every three tablets sold in the first quarter,
according to data compiled by ABI Research and Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mobile-Phone Presence &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been making an effort to increase its
presence on mobile devices. The Redmond, Washington-based
company struck a deal with Nokia Oyj to place its Windows
operating system on Nokia&#8217;s handsets and earlier this year
Microsoft showed off a version of the system run on ARM
processors, which are found on most mobile phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will release the next version of Office, called
Office 15, in the coming months, according to Microsoft.
Microsoft&#8217;s business division reported $5.81 billion in revenue
last quarter, a 10 percent increase from a year ago, as demand
for Office 2010 remained strong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Boy Genius Report said on May 23 that Microsoft is
planning to release Office for Apple and Android mobile devices
in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller and Microsoft spokesman
Jevon Fark declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s plan to bar junk-
food advertising from children&#8217;s programming would have cost
less than $7.2 million in television ad revenue if it were in
effect last year, according to estimates by Kantar Media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s the amount that Disney generated from beverage and
food commercials aimed at children in 2011, the New York-based
research firm said. The figure is less a 10th of 1 percent of
Disney&#8217;s total annual advertising sales. The company reported ad
revenue of $7.6 billion for its media networks in its last
fiscal year, an increase of 8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zenia Mucha, a spokeswoman for Burbank, California-based
Disney, said the company doesn&#8217;t disclose ad revenue from
individual networks or from particular advertisers. She said the
Kantar figure was inaccurate, without elaborating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney announced today that the Disney XD cable network and
its block of Saturday morning shows on ABC will bar advertising
of foods and beverages that don&#8217;t meet its nutrition guidelines
by 2015. The same restrictions also will apply to the Disney
Channel and Disney Junior -- cable channels that feature
sponsorships but no commercials and therefore aren&#8217;t counted by
Kantar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kantar&#8217;s estimates suggest that the change isn&#8217;t a big
gamble for Disney, the world&#8217;s largest entertainment business.
The company also stands to gain from promoting healthier Disney-
endorsed foods. It&#8217;s developing a &#8220;Mickey Check&#8221; logo, which
will indicate that products meet its nutritional standards. That
will begin appearing by the end of 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company unveiled the plan at an event today with first
lady Michelle Obama, who has made healthy eating a signature
issue of her office. Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger
declined to comment on which products don&#8217;t meet the standards,
beyond saying that there were &#8220;a lot.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We hope to work with these companies so that they can
continue advertising on our programs with a product that is
nutritious and meets our guidelines,&#8221; he said at the event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving parents assurance that Disney-branded products are
healthy will ultimately will increase sales, Iger said. &#8220;We can
create huge change without having the government step in.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) won preliminary
court approval of a $44.6 million settlement of a lawsuit in
which it was accused of conspiring to rig bids on municipal bond
deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero in New York ruled
yesterday in a 2008 class-action antitrust case against JPMorgan
and other banks. This settlement applies to only JPMorgan and
its Bear Stearns unit. Other banks have settled, and state
attorneys general have entered into accords with banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The court finds the agreement was entered into at arm&#8217;s
length by highly experienced counsel and is sufficiently within
the range of reasonableness,&#8221; Marrero wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment on the ruling. Investors who brought the
suit include the city of Baltimore and the University of
Mississippi Medical Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael D. Hausfeld, a lawyer for the investors, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a call seeking comment on the approval. The
judge scheduled a hearing in the case for Dec. 14. As part of
his ruling, Marrero agreed that certification of the case as a
class-action suit was warranted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investors claim that the banks rigged bids and
&#8220;restrained, suppressed or eliminated&#8221; competition for
municipal derivatives, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re Municipal Derivatives Antitrust

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s
biggest energy company, and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) said a U.S.-
led transformation of the natural-gas market will boost the
global economy even as oil becomes more expensive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Natural gas is quickly becoming a key enabler of economic
growth and environmental progress around the world,&#8221; Rex W. Tillerson, chief executive officer of Exxon, said at a
conference today in Kuala Lumpur. &#8220;We are living at a historic
moment in the evolution of energy markets. How we respond will
shape the quality of life for generations to come.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A shale boom in the U.S. has helped it surpass Russia as
the world&#8217;s biggest producer of natural gas and brought the
country close to energy independence. Gas is poised to overtake
coal as the second-most widely used source of energy worldwide
by 2025, with demand in Asia projected to grow by more than 50
percent over the next three decades, Tillerson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reserves of gas, a cleaner-burning fuel, are helping
rebuild the U.S. economy and enabling China to replace more-polluting coal, Peter Voser, Shell&#8217;s chief executive office,
said in a separate speech at the World Gas Conference in the
Malaysian capital today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. gas production increased 8.1 percent last year alone,
about the same as in four years in the previous decade, the
International Energy Agency said in report released today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.S. Surplus Gas &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While the U.S. has yet to export LNG, it is already
physically exporting its gas surplus to neighboring countries,&#8221;
including Canada and Mexico, according to the report. While
Australia&#8217;s LNG production was stagnant last year, the country
is expected to be the largest LNG supplier by the end of the
decade, the IEA said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell, Exxon, Chevron Corp. (CVX) and Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) are
among companies leading $180 billion of liquefied-natural-gas
ventures in Australia that are underpinned by demand from Asia&#8217;s
biggest economies. China, estimated to hold triple the shale
reserves of the U.S., and Australia will see the next wave of
the gas revolution as world LNG demand doubles in the next
decade, Voser told delegates at the conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woodside, Australia&#8217;s second-biggest oil and gas producer,
said the U.S. is unlikely to grant new natural-gas export
permits until after the presidential election and volumes
eventually shipped may be lower than some predictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.S. Obstacles &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some people speculate about numbers up to 100 million
tons per year&#8221; of liquefied natural gas exports, Chief Executive
Officer Peter Coleman said in an interview at the Kuala Lumpur
conference. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see that. It&#8217;s unlikely there will be a lot
of movement on additional expansion until after the election
cycle in the U.S.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woodside, operator of the A$15 billion ($14.6 billion)
Pluto LNG project in Western Australia, expects the U.S. to
export 30 million to 50 million metric tons of the fuel &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the U.S., you are always going to have constraints with
the need for gas in power generation and the chemicals
industry,&#8221; Coleman said. &#8220;That says a lot of gas will
stay in the U.S.,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Australian LNG has its place.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benchmark gas prices in the U.S. have slumped to the lowest
in a decade amid a supply glut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas futures slid to $1.90 per million Btu on the New York
Mercantile Exchange April 19, the lowest since September 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil prices are unlikely to collapse as they did in 2008
because long-term fundamentals haven&#8217;t changed and supply will
struggle to meet a projected increase in global demand,
according to Voser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. crude futures, which slumped to an eight-month low
near $81 a barrel yesterday, have declined because of concern
over economic growth this year and as geopolitical tension in
producing regions subside, the Shell CEO said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oil Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The softening of the oil price at the moment is a
reflection of some of the geopolitical issues being less
dominant and the lower demand outlook,&#8221; Voser said. &#8220;The long-term fundamentals haven&#8217;t changed, which means that most
probably, given energy-demand growth in the world in the longer
term, supply will struggle to keep pace.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil dropped from a record high of $147.27 a barrel to
$32.40 between July and December 2008 as the global recession
sapped demand. Futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange
tumbled 17 percent last month, the most since December 2008, and
traded today as high as $84.92 a barrel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen a lot of volatility, mainly on the demand
side,&#8221; Voser said after delivering a keynote address at the
industry gathering. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had some geopolitical dimensions
around the Middle East, in Iran and Syria, following the
political tensions in Libya a year ago, so I think that&#8217;s
reflected in the price in the more short to medium term.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil traded as high as $110.55 a barrel March 1 on
speculation that international sanctions against Iran threatened
supplies from the world&#8217;s fourth-biggest producer. Prices have
since dropped as Iran resumed talks with the West over its
nuclear program while Europe&#8217;s debt crisis and China&#8217;s slowing
economy damped the outlook for oil demand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTC Corp. (2498) is being shut out of the
introduction of Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s next Windows software, people
with knowledge of the matter said, cutting off another source of
revenue after HTC reduced its second-quarter sales forecast by
13 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft locked out HTC from the development of products
using the newest version of its operating system on concern that
HTC doesn&#8217;t sell enough devices or have ample experience making
tablets, said the people, who asked not to be named because
negotiations between HTC and other companies are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s decision will keep HTC, maker of the first
Google Inc.-branded smartphone, from participating in the
electronics industry&#8217;s latest attempt to erode Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s lead
in tablets. The Taiwanese company, whose stock has dropped 67
percent in the past year, is also facing shortages from
chipmaker Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM), highlighting the challenge of competing
with Apple and Samsung Electronics Co. -- two companies whose
dominance in manufacturing and software are increasingly
marginalizing smaller rivals like HTC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Every consumer knows about Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy platform and
the iPhone, and you are starting to see consumers coalesce
around them,&#8221; said Matthew Thornton, an analyst at Avian
Securities LLC, who yesterday cut his rating on HTC to negative.
&#8220;Things just get worse from here. It&#8217;s a very bleak outlook.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Windows RT &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft plans to release its next Windows operating
system, the first to run on chips with technology from ARM
Holdings Plc, in time for the holiday shopping season. The ARM
version of the new software, designed for tablets that compete
with the iPad, is called Windows RT. Other tablets and computers
will be made using chips based on Intel Corp.&#8217;s technology. The
software, also called Windows 8, will appear in devices from
companies like Toshiba Corp. and Asustek Computer Inc. later
this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTC is a strong partner now and for the future, said Frank Shaw, a spokesman for Microsoft, in an e-mailed statement. He
declined to discuss specifics. HTC intends to support future
versions of Windows and isn&#8217;t commenting on the details of its
product plans, said Sally Julien, a U.S.-based spokeswoman at
HTC, in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTC has been unable to either develop its own software or
hardware or sell enough devices to make it the first in line for
its suppliers, said Ramon Llamas, an analyst at IDC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Controlling the supply chain or influencing the supply
chain is one of the things that takes you to success,&#8221; said
Llamas. &#8220;It can very quickly turn on you if you&#8217;re not
controlling everything in-house.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Product Delays &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTC said yesterday that second-quarter sales would be NT$91
billion ($3.05 billion), below a previous forecast of NT$105
billion because of product delays in the U.S. and lower-than-
anticipated sales in Europe. Besides smartphones, HTC also makes
tablets with Google&#8217;s Android operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which has tightly controlled the number of ARM-
based devices it is supporting at first to ensure quality, opted
not to work with HTC after initial discussions with the company,
said the two people familiar with the matter. The world&#8217;s
largest software maker decided to work with other vendors that
had greater sales volume and more tablet experience for the
first round of devices, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTC engineers wanted to build a Windows device with a
customized home screen that would be distinctive to its devices,
as manufacturers are allowed to do with Android. Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft (MSFT) refused, said the people, and HTC was
left off the list of companies the software maker provided with
early versions of the software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sales Decline &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTC may release a Windows device later, in a second round
of products to come next year, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After surging 90 percent in 2010 and 65 percent last year,
HTC&#8217;s sales will decline 12 percent this year, according to the
average of analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first quarter, HTC&#8217;s smartphone shipments dropped 23
percent as Samsung&#8217;s more than tripled and Apple&#8217;s increased 89
percent, according to IDC. Samsung and Apple account for 53
percent of the market. HTC has a 4.8 percent share, according to
the market researcher, placing it fifth behind Nokia Oyj and
Research In Motion Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participating in the introduction of Windows RT tablets
would be unlikely to solve all that ails HTC. The machines will
be starting from a zero-market-share position, without the
advantage of popular, older Windows applications that won&#8217;t run
on ARM hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Relationship Shift &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation underlines the shift in the relationship
between Microsoft and HTC, which once relied on each other to
prop up early efforts in the mobile-phone market. The two
companies started working together on Microsoft&#8217;s mobile phones
early in the last decade and the first Windows-based phone was
manufactured by HTC. At the time, Microsoft had virtually no
experience in the area, and HTC was a maker of unbranded generic
phones for other companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTC recently has placed more emphasis on its better-selling
Android phones, and Microsoft has forged a closer relationship
with HTC competitor Nokia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, HTC has seven Windows Phone models on sale globally.
The operating system has about 2 percent share of the market,
according to IDC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. and Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s
Motorola Mobility unit are headed to a trial in a dispute over
royalty rates on the Xbox gaming system and Windows products,
after a judge refused to end the case in Microsoft&#8217;s favor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute revolves around patents owned by Libertyville,
Illinois-based Motorola Mobility that are used in standards that
all electronics, including the Microsoft products, follow for
WiFi and video coding technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle declined today
to find that Motorola Mobility breached obligations to license
those patents to Microsoft on fair terms, saying the issue must
be resolved at a November trial. Microsoft is also seeking to
prevent Motorola Mobility from winning a ban on sales or U.S.
imports of the Xbox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While the court will not at this time set forth a legal
standard with respect to Motorola&#8217;s duty to offer its patents in
good faith, it is likely that any analysis of Motorola&#8217;s duty
will involve, at least in part, an examination of the intent
behind Motorola&#8217;s offers,&#8221; the judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robart rejected the handset maker&#8217;s claim that Microsoft
lost the right to complain by filing suit instead of responding
to early royalty demands. At this stage in the case, he said,
Microsoft hasn&#8217;t proven Motorola Mobility acted dishonestly in
making its demands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Added Royalties &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility sent letters to Microsoft with what it
said was a standard demand for a 2.25 percent royalty on the end
price of products that use the inventions, including the Xbox
and Windows products. Microsoft contends that would add as much
as $4 billion in annual royalties, a figure Motorola Mobility
disputes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Motorola Mobility has acted in good faith and we will
prove that at trial,&#8221; spokeswoman Jennifer Erickson said in an
e-mail. &#8220;We are pleased that the court is holding Microsoft to
its word -- to license our essential patents just as the vast
majority of the industry has done.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s entertainment unit that includes Xbox sales
generated $8.9 billion in revenue last year, and the Windows
unit garnered $19 billion, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based company is trying to prevent
the U.S. International Trade Commission from blocking imports of
the Xbox from Asia, where it is built. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ITC judge in April said the Xbox infringed four Motorola
Mobility patents, including three related to industry standards.
The commission is scheduled to announce June 25 whether it will
review the infringement finding, and any exclusion order would
be announced in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Patent Leverage &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This case is about Motorola breaking its promise to make
its standard essential patents available on reasonable terms and
putting the price and availability of consumer technology in
jeopardy,&#8221; Microsoft Deputy General Counsel David Howard said
in a statement. &#8220;Today&#8217;s decision underscores that Motorola
made a promise to the industry which it now must keep, and we
look forward to the November trial to determine the appropriate
licensing royalty.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility, which became a Google unit last month,
said that Microsoft refuses to pay royalties on the standard
patents. Motorola Mobility has sued the software maker in the
U.S. and Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robart has prevented Motorola Mobility from taking action
to ban sales of Microsoft products in Germany. Motorola Mobility
officials had no immediate comment on today&#8217;s decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union is investigating complaints by Microsoft
and Apple that Motorola Mobility is unfairly using standard-
essential patents to block competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. case is Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) v. Motorola Inc.,
10cv1823, U.S. District Court for the District of Washington
(Seattle). The ITC case is In the Matter of Gaming and
Entertainment Consoles, 337-752, U.S. International Trade
Commission (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s bid to block imports of
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s Xbox gaming system and Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPhone
based on patents owned by its Motorola Mobility unit may hurt
competition, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FTC, weighing in on cases at the U.S. International
Trade Commission in Washington, recommended limits on the use of
patents related to industry standards to block imports. Motorola
Mobility is using standard-essential patents in cases against
Microsoft and Apple. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gene Yoon, who left Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) in March after five years at the firm, won backing
for a $500 million fund that plans to make private-equity
investments similar to those he oversaw at his former company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The money for Bregal Sagemount&#8217;s first pool was provided by
Bregal Investments and the fund&#8217;s management team, Yoon said in
a telephone interview today. Bregal Investments, the private-
equity division of Zug, Switzerland-based Cofra Holding AG, has
invested more than $9 billion since it was created a decade ago,
according to a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I do have a bit of an entrepreneurial bug in me and if
there&#8217;s an opportunity go out and start your own fund that&#8217;s a
tough thing to say no to,&#8221; Yoon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Goldman Sachs, Yoon helped found the private-capital
investing unit within the bank&#8217;s special situations group. That
business invested the firm&#8217;s own money in growth sectors such as
software by purchasing equity or debt in public or private
companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yoon said the unit is unaffected by the so-called Volcker
rule, which is designed to limit banks from making speculative
investments with their own money. He said it will continue at
Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Everything we were doing in my business was completely
Volcker compliant,&#8221; Yoon said. &#8220;There&#8217;s not a structural
reason why I left or why that business can&#8217;t continue to succeed
at Goldman.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Investment Plans &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yoon, 37, said his two partners at New York-based Bregal
Sagemount are Philip Yates, previously at private-equity firm
Great Hill Partners LLC, and Daniel Kim, who was a vice
president in Goldman Sachs&#8217;s special situations group. Bregal
Sagemount also has two vice presidents and two associates with
plans to have a total of nine or 10 people by the end of the
year, Yoon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bregal Sagemount plans to focus on investments of between
$15 million and $75 million in areas such as business services,
software, information and media, financial services and health
care. The fund can make investments of as much as $150 million
in partnership with Bregal Investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund will be more flexible in its investing style than
some traditional private-equity funds, Yoon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not always going to be in a leveraged buyout, it&#8217;s
not always going to be a minority investment, it&#8217;s not always
going to look like equity, sometimes it could look like debt,&#8221;
Yoon said. &#8220;And we want the flexibility to look at public and
private situations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wharton MBA &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He declined to disclose the fee structure, other than to
say it&#8217;s &#8220;industry standard economics.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s special situations group, a business that
makes some loans in addition to investing the firm&#8217;s own money,
has been led by Hong Kong-based Jason Brown since early last
year. It reports most results as part of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
investing and lending segment, where revenue dropped 72 percent
to $2.14 billion in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yoon joined Goldman Sachs in 2007, after working at Boston-
based Great Hill Partners. He received his bachelor&#8217;s degree and
MBA from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cofra is the holding company for the Brenninkmeijer family,
which founded the closely held CA Group clothing retailer in
the Netherlands. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s $150 million
settlement of a lawsuit over losses from the bank&#8217;s securities
lending program won approval from a federal judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit was filed by three union pension funds, which
represent a class of investors that lost money placed for them
by New York-based JPMorgan in medium-term notes issued by Sigma
Finance Corp., a structured investment vehicle that collapsed in
2008. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin in Manhattan approved
the settlement in an order signed yesterday and made public

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s trading loss
of more than $2 billion shows &#8220;that no institution is immune
from bad judgment,&#8221; U.S. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim
Johnson said in remarks prepared for a Washington hearing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The losses disclosed last month by New York-based JPMorgan,
the biggest and most profitable U.S. bank, shows the need for
reforms included in the Dodd-Frank Act, said Johnson, who is
leading a hearing today on the 2010 regulatory overhaul.
Johnson, a South Dakota Democrat, criticized what he said were
efforts by banks and Republican lawmakers to undermine the law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To repeal or weaken Wall Street Reform, and defund the
cops enforcing it, would take us back to the days before the
financial crisis of 2008,&#8221; Johnson said in his statement for
the hearing, which will include testimony from representatives
of the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency and Treasury Department. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TiVo Inc. (TIVO) filed a lawsuit claiming
that television set-top boxes made by Cisco Systems Inc.
infringe patents related to digital-video recording services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cisco supplies equipment to companies including Verizon
Communications Inc. (VZ) and Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC) The boxes, which
have DVR functions, infringe TiVo&#8217;s patents, according to the
complaint filed June 4 in federal court in Marshall, Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cisco filed a preemptive suit against TiVo May 30 in
federal court in its hometown of San Jose, California, seeking a
ruling that it doesn&#8217;t infringe four TiVo patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TiVo, which pioneered the DVR market before rivals grabbed
more customers, has waged more than seven years of litigation to
get compensation for its inventions. The company provides DVR
services to Comcast Corp. and Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR) Legal
costs are projected to create a wider loss this quarter than
analysts expected, the company said May 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cisco knew of the patents and the infringement because it
has been subpoenaed in TiVo&#8217;s patent suits against Verizon and
ATT Inc., TiVo said in the complaint. Dallas-based ATT agreed
to pay at least $215 million to settle its case, and Alviso,
California-based TiVo got more than $500 million from Dish
Network Corp. (DISH) in a suit first filed in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dueling suits set up a battle as to where the dispute
will be heard. Trial in the case against Verizon could be held
in October in Marshall, based on a joint schedule proposal
submitted by the two sides yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new case is TiVo Inc. v. Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO), 12cv311,
U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas
(Marshall). Cisco&#8217;s case is Cisco v. TiVo, 12cv2766, U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of California (San
Jose). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apple Denied Ban on Samsung Galaxy Tab During U.S. Patent Trial &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. was denied its renewed request for a ban on U.S.
sales of Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)&#8217;s Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet
computer while the case is still before a federal court of
appeals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, said
June 4 that she doesn&#8217;t have jurisdiction to issue a preliminary
injunction because the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit in Washington hasn&#8217;t issued a mandate yet. The judge
said Apple can renew its request once the court in Washington
issues its ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koh in December rejected Apple&#8217;s initial request, which is
part of a broader patent dispute over smartphones and tablets.
Apple&#8217;s renewed request was based on the Federal Circuit&#8217;s
finding that it will probably win its patent infringement claim
relating to the Tab 10.1 tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court said May 14 that Apple can pursue its
efforts to halt sales of the Samsung tablet while the
infringement case is awaiting trial. The appeals court disagreed
with Koh&#8217;s finding that Apple failed to show it was likely to
win its case on the merits, according to court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung, based in Suwon, South Korea, said last month that
Apple&#8217;s renewed request for the injunction is &#8220;premature&#8221;
because Samsung would request a rehearing of the appeals court
decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives of Cupertino, California-based Apple didn&#8217;t
respond to an e-mail after regular business hours seeking
comment on the June 4 ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Apple Inc. (AAPL) v. Samsung Electronics Co., 11-
01846, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San
Jose). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yahoo Said to Be in Talks to Resolve Facebook Patent Litigation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) is in negotiations to resolve a legal dispute
with Facebook Inc. (FB), which it accused of infringing patents,
according to a person briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo has undergone board and management change since it
filed the lawsuit in March and is engaged in the talks to help
improve ties with Facebook, said the person, who didn&#8217;t want to
be identified because the matter is private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under former Chief Executive Officer Scott Thompson, Yahoo
alleged that social-networking provider Facebook infringes
patents covering such functions as Internet privacy, advertising
and information sharing. Facebook countersued in April, accusing
Yahoo of infringing 10 of its patents. Thompson resigned the
following month, amid pressure from investors, after failing to
correct misstatements in his academic record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caryn Marooney, a spokeswoman for Menlo Park, California-
based Facebook, declined to comment June 4, as did Dana
Lengkeek, a spokeswoman for Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook bulked up on intellectual property in the wake of
the Yahoo lawsuit. It said in April that it&#8217;s paying $550
million for some of the patents that Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) agreed to
buy from AOL Inc. Facebook also acquired patents from
International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), a person with knowledge
of the matter said in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo, in the lawsuit filed March 12 in federal court in
San Jose, California, sought an order barring Facebook from
infringing the 10 patents. It also sought triple damages.
Facebook later accused Yahoo of infringing 10 patents through
its home page and the Flickr-photo sharing service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement talks were reported earlier this week in the
AllThingsD blog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Yahoo! Inc. v. Facebook, 12-cv-01212, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Merck Sues Sandoz, Intas Over Proposed Generic Copy of Emend &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck  Co. (MRK) sued the Sandoz unit of Swiss drugmaker
Novartis AG (NOVN) and Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (INTAS) to block them from
selling generic forms of Emend, which prevents nausea and
vomiting from chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sandoz, the generic-drug maker, and Intas&#8217;s Accord
Healthcare unit seek U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval
to sell intravenous forms of Emend, according to the lawsuits,
filed in federal court in Trenton, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck, the second-largest U.S. drugmaker, said the Sandoz
and Accord drugs would infringe two patents and seeks a court
order to prevent sales until they expire in February 2015 and
March 2019. Emend in all forms generated $419 million in sales
last year, an 11 percent increase from 2010, Whitehouse Station,
New Jersey-based Merck said in its annual report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sandoz case was filed May 31, and the Accord complaint
was filed June 1. A spokeswoman for Sandoz had no immediate
comment on the litigation. Samir Mehta, the president of Durham,
North Carolina-based Accord, didn&#8217;t immediately return a call
seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Merck v. Accord Healthcare, 12-cv-3324 and
Merck v. Sandoz Inc., 12-cv-3289, U.S. District Court, District
of New Jersey (Trenton). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coca-Cola Loses German Trademark Bid Against PepsiCo on Bottle &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO) lost a German court bid it filed against
PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) over the form of bottles used to sell beverages.
PepsiCo&#8217;s &#8220;Carolina&#8221; bottle doesn&#8217;t illicitly resemble a form
Coca-Cola had registered as a European trademark, the Hamburg
Regional Court said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is: LG Hamburg, 315 O 310/11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SABMiller Unit in Trademark Dispute Over Old Aussie Beer Brands &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SABMiller Plc (SAB), brewer of Peroni, Foster&#8217;s, Pilsner Urquell
and Miller Genuine Draft, is involved in a dispute over defunct
beer brands with an Australian craft brewer, the Sydney Morning
Herald reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thunder Road Brewing Co. is challenging SABMiller&#8217;s
Foster&#8217;s unit&#8217;s use of the brand names under a provision of
Australian trademark law specifying that a trademark must be
used or risk being lost, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philip Withers, Thunder Road&#8217;s chief executive officer,
told the Sydney Morning Herald that the historic brands are
important to the revival of Australia&#8217;s brewing industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foster&#8217;s told the newspaper it would defend the marks and
they continue to be part of its business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Medvedev&#8217;s Uploads Removed From Social Network Over Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia&#8217;s Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev had four of the
videos he uploaded to the Vkontakte social network site removed
over copyright issues, the Russian News Service reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disputed videos were excerpts from an interview with
Russian journalist Vladimir Pozner that originally aired on
state-owned Channel One on June 4, according to the news
service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Vkontakte spokesman said a moderator from Channel One
scanned the social-network site in search of unauthorized
content and didn&#8217;t realize what he had banned, the news service
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medvedev obtained the videos legally from Channel One, the
Vkontakte spokesman said, and the Russian News Service reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;IP Moves &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quinn Emanuel Hires Patent Litigator from Latham  Watkins &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quinn Emanuel Urquhart  Sullivan LLP  hired Yury Kapgan
for its intellectual-property practice, the Los Angeles-based
firm said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kapgan, a litigator, joins from Latham  Watkins LLP, also
of Los Angeles. He has represented clients in patent and other
IP-related disputes involving computer software and hardware,
automotive technology, digital-rights management and industry
standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has an undergraduate degree from the University of
California at Los Angeles and a law degree from the University
of California, Berkeley, School of Law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fish  Richardson Hires Former ITC Attorney Fusco &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fish  Richardson PC hired Thomas S. &#8220;Monty&#8221; Fusco, the
Boston-based IP specialty firm said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fusco was formerly a supervisory attorney at the U.S.
International Trade Commission, a Washington-based governmental
body with the power to bar entry to items that infringe U.S.
patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has 23 years of experience with the trade commission,
which has increasingly become the forum of choice for technology
companies&#8217; patent disputes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fusco has an undergraduate degree in history from the
University of Maryland, a master&#8217;s degree in African-American
studies from the University of California at Los Angeles, and a
law degree from American University. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an oak-paneled church hall a few
blocks from Big Ben, Paul Deighton, chief executive officer of
the London Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic
Games, strides to the podium. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&#8217;s holding the almost 3-foot-high golden torch that he
proudly says was designed in east London and manufactured in
northern England. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all the mighty symbolism, the torch can&#8217;t shield
Deighton from the skeptical audience gathered one evening in
March to hear how they can profit from this summer&#8217;s Olympics,
Bloomberg Markets magazine reports in its July issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hall is filled with about 200 small-business owners,
and a gloomy mood prevails as Britain struggles through its
first double-dip recession since the 1970s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One woman waves a London 2012 brochure and asks why it was
printed in China when the games should be helping British
businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;ll look into it,&#8221; Deighton promises. He gently reminds
her that 95 percent of London 2012 contracts were awarded to
British firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another man asks about a feared shortage of portable
toilets in the Olympic Park. Deighton politely reassures him
that they&#8217;ve got that one covered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s fitting that a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) banker
is running the business end of the Olympics -- and getting
dumped on by cantankerous Londoners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bleaker Mood &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Britain won the bid for the 2012 games seven years
ago, the economy was booming, Prime Minister Tony Blair was
presiding over what was still &#8220;Cool Britannia&#8221; and the City,
London&#8217;s financial district, was gorging on cheap credit and
megabonuses for bankers like Deighton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then a bleaker mood set in. The day after London won,
homegrown terrorists bombed the city&#8217;s public transportation
system, killing 52 people and raising fears of more attacks,
including during the games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, after a decade in office, Blair stepped down. Soon
the financial crisis was rocking the U.K., followed by the
sovereign-debt calamity in Europe, Britain&#8217;s largest trading
partner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against that backdrop, not to mention the biggest
government budget cuts since World War II, a summer of Olympics
celebration offers London some relief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Public Eye&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might not have seemed that way to Deighton as he fielded
hostile questions in the church. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deighton, 56, says his 22-year career at Goldman didn&#8217;t
prepare him for being quizzed about such nitty-gritty details by
a cynical British public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When you&#8217;re in investment banking, you&#8217;re pretty much
under everybody&#8217;s radar all the time,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Here,
everything we do all the time is completely in the public eye.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he speaks, Deighton is sitting in his office, a space so
cramped that, in his telling, a visiting delegation from the
2014 Winter Games, set to take place in Sochi, Russia, figured
he couldn&#8217;t be terribly important. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiry and blue-eyed, Deighton says he&#8217;s more cheerleader
than chief executive now that the hard part of the games for him
-- the finances -- is in place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Britain prepares to welcome 15,000 athletes from 205
countries on July 27 for more than four weeks of Olympic and
Paralympic Games, Deighton is charged with making sure that the
events, which will be watched by more than 4 billion people, are
delivered on time, on budget and nightmare-free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Age of Austerity &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together with London 2012 committee Chairman Sebastian Coe,
the only man to have won 1,500-meter Olympic gold twice,
Deighton is overseeing everything from transport to security,
while making sure he&#8217;s got enough of those portable toilets.
Surely his is one of the toughest jobs in the world right now? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The best job in the world,&#8221; Deighton says, smiling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the games will take place in an age of austerity,
they won&#8217;t be austere. In 2007, after underestimating the cost
of cleaning up the site and constructing sports venues, the
Blair government more than tripled the original spending plan,
to 9.3 billion pounds ($14.3 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, Deighton&#8217;s London Organizing Committee of the
Olympic and Paralympic Games, or Locog, has a separate 2.2
billion pound budget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a country still reeling from the financial crisis, the
money amounts to a backdoor Keynesian stimulus. Plus, Deighton
says, the total outlay guarantees London a boost in tourism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dancing Nurses &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the spending pales in comparison to the $67
billion China lavished on the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the
government of Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron is doing
what it can to make Britain cool again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Getting it right and doing the best for Britain is the
overriding political driver in this, rather than saving the last
pound to cut the deficit,&#8221; says Tony Travers, director of LSE
London, a research center at the London School of Economics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government even found an extra 41 million pounds in
public money to mount Olympic spectacles, including &#8220;Slumdog
Millionaire&#8221; director Danny Boyle&#8217;s secrecy-shrouded opening
ceremony, which somehow will merge Shakespeare&#8217;s &#8220;The
Tempest,&#8221; a play about a shipwreck, with dancing National
Health Service nurses, singing schoolchildren and Paul McCartney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending on security has risen to more than 1 billion
pounds as the government tries to guarantee a trouble-free
Olympics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Surface-to-Air Missiles &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original budget for security at Olympic venues has
almost doubled to 553 million pounds to pay for 23,700 guards
instead of the original estimate of 10,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a time of deep cuts in policing and national defense,
the government is spending another 475 million pounds on wider
security measures, unsettling local residents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Defense says it has tested sites around
Olympic venues as part of a plan to deploy surface-to-air-
missile batteries to prevent a terror Armageddon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2012 games are sumptuous compared with the last time
London hosted an Olympics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was in 1948 in the shadow of World War II, when
athletes ate whale meat to supplement beef rations and slept in
schools that had been converted into makeshift dorms. The
government spent 750,000 pounds, about 20 million in today&#8217;s
pounds, on what came to be known as &#8220;the Austerity Olympics.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Legacy Bid &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time around, it was so-called legacy planning that
helped Britain win the bid. London&#8217;s plan to use the games to
revitalize the East End will serve as a blueprint for future
hosts, Jacques Rogge, the International Olympic Committee
president, told reporters earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, the government has turned what was once
London&#8217;s industrial core, a port crisscrossed by railways, into
Europe&#8217;s largest public building project -- a 500-acre (200-
hectare) Olympic Park in the midst of some of the most deprived
boroughs in Britain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bombed by German warplanes and contaminated by industrial
waste, the area was a toxic badlands. Prior to building
anything, contractors spent 2 billion pounds to clean up the
place; they even decommissioned a Luftwaffe bomb. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before London won the bid, Australia&#8217;s Westfield Group (WDC), the
world&#8217;s biggest owner of shopping centers, acquired a site next
to the Olympic Park for Westfield Stratford City, a glittering,
1.8 billion pound edifice plopped down alongside grim high-rise
public housing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shopping Olympics &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three-quarters of the visitors to the games will funnel
through Europe&#8217;s largest urban shopping center -- past 240
stores, from Armani to Zara -- and be enticed to take part in
the Shopping Olympics before they get to the real thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the games, the Athletes&#8217; Village will be turned into
an apartment complex called the East Village. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment Co., a unit of Qatar&#8217;s
sovereign-wealth fund, and Delancey Estates Plc, a British
developer, paid 557 million pounds last year for about half of
the apartments and the right to build 2,000 homes nearby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remaining apartments, bought by three public housing
associations, will be turned into &#8220;affordable&#8221; homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Locog&#8217;s own budget, Deighton hunted down sponsors to
supplement income from the sale of broadcasting rights, tickets
and branded merchandise. His target for UK sponsors was 700
million pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By moving early, he avoided getting caught empty-handed
when the credit crunch hit in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was clear to me the sun was shining in the financial
sector,&#8221; Deighton says. &#8220;Being in the markets all my working
life tells me you do a deal when the market is there. You don&#8217;t
wait for it to get any better.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Ice to Eskimos&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. went bankrupt in
September of that year, Deighton had already locked in seven
sponsors, raising 400 million pounds. They included Lloyds TSB
Bank Plc, part of whose contribution, in an ironic twist, fell
to British taxpayers because the bank was bailed out by the U.K.
government in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locog ended up raising more money from sponsors than any
other Summer Olympics organizing committee, Coe says. Deighton,
who says his &#8220;sweaty moments&#8221; occurred when piecing together
all of the finances, won praise for pulling in another 300
million pounds after the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I reckon he could sell ice to the Eskimos,&#8221; says Dee
Doocey, a member of the House of Lords who stepped down in May
from the London Assembly. &#8220;And he could make the Eskimos thank
him for selling the ice. I don&#8217;t think anybody could have raised
the money he has in this economic climate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goldman-Style &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deighton is self-deprecating enough to give Coe credit. He
says Coe -- a former Conservative member of Parliament and now a
member of the House of Lords -- is the celebrity with the unique
connections in political and Olympics circles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I am the easy one to clone,&#8221; Deighton says. &#8220;He&#8217;s the
hard one.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deighton, who made 50 million pounds when Goldman went
public in 1999, says his ease in working with Coe stems from
Goldman&#8217;s tradition of co-senior partners, as when Robert Rubin
(who would go on to be U.S. Treasury secretary) and Stephen Friedman ran the firm jointly in the early 1990s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I always remember Bob saying when he and Stephen had a
different point of view about something, he&#8217;d simply evaluate
which one of them felt more strongly about it,&#8221; Deighton says.
Of Coe, he says: &#8220;We&#8217;re both very happy to cede to each other
big decisions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;All-British McNuggets &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was Coe after all who hired him. When London won the bid
for the 2012 games -- beating Paris, New York, Madrid and Moscow
-- Deighton was at Goldman&#8217;s London headquarters on a video
conference call with colleagues in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For the first time in 22 years, I got their attention and
they actually listened to me when I told them London had won,&#8221;
he recalled to a group of business leaders in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deighton took up the Locog post in April 2006 after seeing
an ad in The Economist. He&#8217;d been at Goldman since 1983,
initially in investment banking focusing on aerospace before
spending two years in New York running the controllers
department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After returning to London in 1996, he made partner and
became chief operating officer for Europe as Goldman began
ramping up its presence in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deighton, who earns 480,000 pounds a year and promised to
give his 2011 Locog bonus of 220,125 pounds to charity, says he
has no regrets about moving into a job that requires him to
wrestle with such matters as the percentage of British chicken
in the McNuggets sold at McDonald&#8217;s Olympic Park outlets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;d answered every question there was about derivatives
regulations,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Why not about chickens?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The McNuggets are now 100 percent British after some public
wrangling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Downton Abbey&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The occasional absurdities of staging an Olympics spawned a
BBC spoof documentary, &#8220;Twenty Twelve,&#8221; starring Hugh
Bonneville of &#8220;Downton Abbey&#8221; as the &#8220;head of deliverance,&#8221;
aka Deighton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality of organizing the Olympics is sometimes funny
enough, Deighton says, adding, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t they just bring a
camera into my office every day?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deighton recalls a conversation he had in 2006 with Ken Livingstone, then London&#8217;s mayor, about whether they could save
money on the 269 million pound Zaha Hadid-designed aquatics
center by not putting the roof on it -- or just installing a
partial one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Do you let the swimmers get wet who are in the water, or
do you need to keep the crowds dry?&#8221; Deighton says, laughing at
the recollection. In the end, they kept the whole roof. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gridlock Everywhere &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the games draw closer, Deighton says he&#8217;s growing
calmer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m actually sleeping probably as well as I&#8217;ve slept
during the past 6 1/2 years,&#8221; he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same can&#8217;t be said for many others in London amid talk
of gridlock in the air, on the streets and underground. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Heathrow, the world&#8217;s third-busiest airport, airlines
have warned of delays caused by increased air traffic and long
lines through customs and immigration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deloitte LLP, the accounting firm, says London&#8217;s subway
system, which struggles as it is to move 4 million people around
London each day, will have to cope with an additional 3 million
daily journeys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While nearly 80,000 athletes, VIPs and journalists zip
around the city in specially designated lanes, the less
fortunate may find themselves stuck in Olympic-size traffic
jams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;On Track&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One rainy day in May, Deighton heads to the Olympic Park to
survey his work. He passes the basketball arena, explaining how
London organizers are in talks with Rio de Janeiro about
shipping the structure to Brazil and using it there for the 2016
games -- all part of his pledge to not leave behind any white
elephants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He turns and points to the looming, 1.9 million-square-foot
(176,000-square-meter) shopping mall, where he says 10,000 jobs
have been created. All thanks to the games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People don&#8217;t mind you spending money as long as you
demonstrate you&#8217;ve really thought about the long-term return,&#8221;
he says, sounding like both the banker he once was and the
Olympics impresario he now is. &#8220;We&#8217;re on track, but you really
can&#8217;t assess it until it&#8217;s over.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they&#8217;re over, the Olympics often don&#8217;t yield the
returns their proponents promised; post-2004 Athens is Exhibit
A. And yet if Deighton is proved right, he and London alike will
reap benefits long after that torch he carries around has been
passed to someone else. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, plans to sell a minority stake in its animal health
division in an initial stock sale by July 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit and its more than 9,000 employees worldwide will
become a stand-alone company called Zoetis, New York-based
Pfizer said today in a statement. The divested business may be
valued from $15 billion to $20 billion, Catherine Arnold, an
analyst with Credit Suisse in New York, said in an April note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The divestiture of the animal health operations, which sold
$4.18 billion in products for pets and livestock last year, is
part of a three-pronged strategy by Chief Executive Officer Ian Read to refocus the company on developing new pharmaceuticals.
He said in April that the unit would probably be shed in a
combined initial public offering and share swap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pfizer Animal Health is a dynamic business with strong
fundamentals, an expanding and loyal direct customer base and a
proven management team,&#8221; Read said today in the statement.
&#8220;Our focus continues to be on taking the actions that will
generate the greatest after-tax value for our shareholders.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer rose less than 1 percent to $21.94 at the close in
New York and has gained 5.8 percent in the past 12 months. The
company previously said that July 2013 was its target to
complete the changeover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nutrition Sale &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer announced on April 23 that it would sell its infant
nutrition business to Vevey, Switzerland-based Nestle SA (NESN) for
$11.9 billion. Read has also said he is eliminating $1 billion
from costs this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money from the unit divestitures is likely to be used for
more share buybacks, Read has said, calling them &#8220;the case to
beat&#8221; compared to acquisitions and dividend payments. Pfizer
has repurchased 2.43 billion shares worth $66.1 billion since
1998, according to a report by John Boris, an analyst with
Citigroup in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer needs new products as it enters an era without
Lipitor, the cholesterol pill that lost patent protection in
2011 after generating $9.58 billion in revenue that year. The
company doesn&#8217;t have a medicine in its pipeline that will
replace all of Lipitor&#8217;s sales by itself. Instead, Pfizer is
trying to fill the hole with several products, including two
under review by U.S. regulators for possible approval this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eliquis, a blood thinner developed with Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co., is scheduled to get a ruling from regulators by the
end of this month. Tofacitinib, Pfizer&#8217;s anti-arthritis pill, is
scheduled for a decision this summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new name for the company was suggested by the words zoo
and zoology, according to the company statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It &#8220;best captures the company&#8217;s focus on partnership with
veterinarians, livestock producers and companion animal
owners,&#8221; said Juan Ram&#243;n Alaix, president of the division. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treasury yields are likely to fall to
record lows if the debt crisis in Europe escalates, driving
investors to the relative safety of U.S. government securities,
according to JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Terry Belton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasury &#8220;10-year notes have been very highly correlated
with the yield spreads of Spain, Italy and France,&#8221; Belton, the
firm&#8217;s global head of fixed-income and foreign-exchange research,
said in a radio interview on Bloomberg Surveillance with Tom Keene and Ken Prewitt.  If those markets stay &#8220;under stress,
it&#8217;s easy for 10-year notes to go as low as 1.4 percent or even
1.3 percent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe&#8217;s escalating fiscal crisis has prompted investors to
flee other global investments for the safety of U.S. government
bonds, pushing 10-year yields to a record low 1.4387 percent on
June 1. The yield touched the highest level in a week today
after China cut interest rates for the first time since 2008,
stepping up efforts to combat a deepening economic slowdown as
Europe&#8217;s worsening debt crisis threatens global growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spanish borrowing costs approached 7 percent last week, the
level that prompted Greece, Ireland and Portugal to seek
bailouts. Spain is struggling to avoid an international loan
that would add to its debt burden and wants any aid to go
directly to its financial industry. Germany, which is backed by
AAA rated Finland in its stance, argues any aid must come with
austerity strings attached. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Market Barometer &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spanish government bonds advanced today after the nation
exceeded its maximum target at a debt sale, easing concern about
financing the region&#8217;s third-biggest budget deficit. Spain&#8217;s 10-
year securities fell to 6.15 percent as investors bought 2.07
billion euros of Spanish securities, the central bank said,
surpassing its maximum target of 2 billion euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The barometer we are watching are yields on 10-year
Spanish debt,&#8221; Belton said in the interview. &#8220;If they were to
reach the 7 percent level -- get as high as 7.5 percent -- and
the European Central Bank doesn&#8217;t step in, that would be a
catalyst for 10-year notes to go through the 1.4 level.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European stocks and U.S. shares extended gains as China&#8217;s
move added to an Australian rate cut this week and expressions
of concern from European and U.S. central bank officials that
fanned expectations for more stimulus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s &#8220;rate cut is a positive that should help global
growth and help stabilize risky assets,&#8221; said Belton. &#8220;We,
like most other participants, have been downgrading our growth
on China. We are not overly pessimistic.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chinese Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has cut its full-year economic growth forecast for
China twice in a month and now estimates an expansion of 7.7
percent, down from 9.2 percent in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s benchmark one-year lending rate will drop to 6.31
percent from 6.56 percent effective tomorrow, the People&#8217;s Bank
of China said on its website today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s non-manufacturing industries expanded at the
slowest pace in more than a year, as export orders declined and
weakness in real estate countered strength in retailing and
leasing. The purchasing managers&#8217; index fell to 55.2 in May from
56.1 in April, the National Bureau of Statistics and China
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said on June 3 in Beijing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the economy
is at risk from Europe&#8217;s debt crisis and the prospect of fiscal
tightening in the U.S., while refraining from discussing steps
the central bank might take to protect the expansion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The situation in Europe poses significant risks to the U.S.
financial system and economy and must be monitored closely,&#8221;
Bernanke said today in testimony to the Joint Economic Committee
in Washington. &#8220;As always, the Federal Reserve remains prepared
to take action as needed to protect the U.S. financial system
and economy in the event that financial stresses escalate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Song Yu, an economist at Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., comments on China&#8217;s decision to lower interest
rates for the first time since 2008. Song gave the comments in a
note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the cut is a clear and strong signal to the
market of the loosening policy stance. It reflects the concerns
of the top leadership on slowing economic growth and the
relatively benign view on inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;By now, the May data is already compiled, though not
publicly announced. It is likely this data was still be on the
weak side. We still believe May activity data would be
incrementally better than it was in April, but probably is still
deemed to be too weak by senior policymakers. We think the rate
cut could help to alleviate the financial burdens of firms and
boost demand for loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;We believe interest rates will be cut again later in the
year, likely in the third quarter in 2012. We expect multiple
required reserve-ratio cuts, which can happen at any time. We
reiterate the quantity of liquidity holds the key, and we expect
the monetary authorities to be on the relatively loose side of
policymaking.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil rose in New York after China cut
benchmark lending and deposit rates for the first time since
2008, while policy makers in the U.S. and Europe indicated they
may take steps to boost their economies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West Texas Intermediate futures gained as much as 1.8
percent, reversing earlier declines after the People&#8217;s Bank of
China said on its website that the benchmark one-year deposit
rate will drop by 0.25 percentage points from tomorrow. Federal
Reserve Vice Chairman Janet Yellen said the U.S. remains
vulnerable to setbacks that may warrant additional monetary
stimulus. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said
officials are ready to act as the euro area&#8217;s outlook worsens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market is hoping for a new money bazooka from the
central banks and rescue funds,&#8221; said Michael Poulsen, an
analyst at Global Risk Management in Middelfart, Denmark, who
predicts oil prices will remain near current levels. &#8220;In recent
days we&#8217;ve seen some decent volume during every upward move, and
that indicates some clear buying interest.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil for July delivery rose as much as $1.50 to $86.52 a
barrel and was at $86.30 in electronic trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange at 1:02 p.m. London time. The contract
yesterday rose 73 cents to $85.02, the highest close since May
31. Prices are 13 percent lower this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent oil for July settlement was at $101.90 a barrel, up
$1.26, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
European benchmark contract&#8217;s premium to West Texas Intermediate
was at $15.60, compared with $15.62 yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goldman Reiterates Recommendation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil in New York, which fell 17 percent in May for the
biggest monthly drop in more than three years, may rebound if
policy makers take steps to contain the European debt crisis and
counter weaker economic growth in the U.S. and China, Goldman
Sachs said in e-mailed report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman reiterated its call to buy West Texas Intermediate
crude futures for September delivery. The recommendation, first
made on Feb. 22, has so far generated a &#8220;dismal&#8221; loss of
$22.72 a barrel, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices may also gain as sanctions tighten on Iran and a
surplus caused by increased output from Saudi Arabia, the
biggest producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, is eroded, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iran, OPEC&#8217;s second-biggest crude producer, faces
additional European Union sanctions starting July 1 because of
its nuclear program. The embargo will remove about 1 million
barrels of oil from the market, the International Energy Agency
estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Site Inspections &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iran will &#8220;never suspend&#8221; its enrichment of uranium and
&#8220;will not permit our national security to be jeopardized&#8221; by
International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors working for
Western intelligence agencies, Ali Asghar Soltanieh, the
nation&#8217;s envoy to the IAEA, told reporters in Vienna yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soltanieh contradicted IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano&#8217;s
May 22 announcement that a decision had been made to allow
inspectors increased access to nuclear sites. The Persian Gulf
nation&#8217;s nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili only pledged his
&#8220;determination&#8221; to reach an accord, Soltanieh said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diplomats from China, France, Germany, Russia, the U.K. and
the U.S. are scheduled to hold a third round of talks with their
Iranian counterparts in Moscow on June 18-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia may rein in oil sales after it achieved a
$100-a-barrel target for London-traded Brent by cutting the
price of its crude and pumping at the highest rate in at least
three decades. The world&#8217;s biggest exporter started to scale
back shipments this month, according to Vienna-based researcher
JBC Energy GmbH, citing tanker fixtures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.S. Supplies &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. crude stockpiles fell for the first time in 11 weeks.
Inventories dropped by 111,000 barrels last week, a report from
the Energy Department showed yesterday. They were forecast to
decline 500,000 barrels, according to the median of 12 analyst
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for New
York-traded futures, increased 926,000 barrels to a record 47.8
million. Domestic oil production rose to 6.25 million barrels a
day, the highest level since February 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasoline supplies climbed 3.3 million barrels, the Energy
Department report showed. They were forecast to gain 950,000
barrels, according to the survey. Distillate stockpiles, a
category that includes heating oil and diesel, rose 2.3 million
barrels, compared with a projected drop of 250,000 barrels. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trades by JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s
London-based chief investment office have raised the cost of
hedging debt of companies from ATT Inc. (T) to CenturyLink Inc. (CTL) and
Dell Inc. (DELL) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said
during a May 10 conference call with analysts and investors that
the bank had a $2 billion trading loss in credit derivatives,
the 10-year Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index
Series 9, created in 2007 and speculated to be one of the
biggest positions contributing to the loss, has surged 21 basis
points relative to the current most-active index, the five-year
Series 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technical effect of the so-called IG9 index&#8217;s surge has
pushed credit-default swaps on the index&#8217;s constituents wider,
including ATT, CenturyLink and Dell&#8217;s five-year contracts,
according to Hale Holden, a Barclays Plc strategist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &#8220;further normalization in IG9 positioning could take
these credits even wider in the near term, they stand to benefit
when technicals abate and fundamental relative value reasserts
itself,&#8221; Barclays strategists Shobhit Gupta and Eric Gross
wrote in a note dated today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News reported in April that JPMorgan trader Bruno Iksil had amassed positions linked to the financial health of
corporations that were so large he was driving price moves in
the $10 trillion swap-index market, earning him the nickname the
London Whale among some counterparties, according to market
participants who asked not to be identified because they aren&#8217;t
authorized to discuss the trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Against Bruno&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jump in the index, fueled by the size of the JPMorgan
trades relative to the market&#8217;s liquidity, has been exacerbated
by traders anticipating an unwinding of the positions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distortion in the indexes and the individual-company
swaps is caused by JPMorgan or &#8220;people trading against Bruno,&#8221;
Bonnie Baha, head of global developed credit at DoubleLine
Capital LP in Los Angeles, which oversees $35 billion, said in a
telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon declined on the conference call to discuss specific
transactions or people involved.  Credit-default swaps pay the
buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations,
less the value of the defaulted debt. JPMorgan used the
instruments to hedge exposure on loans and other credit risks
tied to corporations, banks and sovereign governments. The
losses emerged after the firm tried to reduce that position,
Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL) unveiled the next version
of its mobile software, adding maps and integration with
Facebook Inc. (FB) to ratchet up pressure on Google Inc. (GOOG) in the
market for handheld devices and online applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple&#8217;s iOS 6 will have more than 200 new features,
including turn-by-turn map navigation and tools to make it
easier to access Facebook from iPhones and iPads, Cupertino,
California-based Apple said today. The company also upgraded its
MacBook computers, adding faster chips and sharper displays to
the high-end Pro model months before competing devices with
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s Windows arrive in stores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is using new software,
unveiled at the company&#8217;s annual Worldwide Developers
Conference, to widen Apple&#8217;s user base and woo developers who
can add to a store that has more than 650,000 downloadable
games, magazines and productivity tools. The new mapping
service, which replaces Google Maps, and new voice-recognition
tools that make it easier to bypass traditional search engines,
reflect Apple&#8217;s efforts to diminish Google on its devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The rift between Google and Apple couldn&#8217;t be clearer
than it was today,&#8221; said Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper
Jaffray Cos. &#8220;They just keep raising the temperature.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rivalry has grown as Google puts its software on
machines made by Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) and other electronics
companies to challenge the iPhone and iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Facebook Integration &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphones running Google&#8217;s Android operating system
combined accounted for 56 percent of global sales in the first
three months of the year, compared with 23 percent for the
iPhone, according to Gartner Inc. The iPhone is the best-selling
smartphone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple announced today that it&#8217;s working more closely with
Facebook, another big rival to Google. The new features make it
easier for iPhone and iPad users to post pictures and other
content to the social network. Apple also is adding Facebook
&#8220;like&#8221; buttons to the App Store and iTunes. Google introduced
its own Facebook competitor, Google+, this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple is also adding Baidu Inc. (BIDU)&#8217;s search engine as an
alternative to Google for iPhone, iPad and Mac users in the
world&#8217;s most populous country. In another move to appeal to
Chinese users, Apple is updating its voice-recognition service
Siri to work for Mandarin and Cantonese speakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Strengthening Siri &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple announced several other changes to Siri. The company
is making the service available for iPad users and added the
ability use voice commands to search for sports scores and make
reservations through OpenTable Inc. (OPEN)&#8217;s service. Apple said that
it&#8217;s working with carmakers, including Bayerische Motoren Werke
AG (BMW), General Motors Co. (GM), Honda Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. (7203),
to add a button to car steering wheels to quickly activate Siri. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another new feature is called Passbook, an application that
organizes electronic gift cards, boarding passes or movie
tickets. The feature could eventually include credit-card data
and may mark an early step toward wireless payments for iPhone,
said Ross Rubin, an analyst at NPD Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple has more than 400 million credit cards on file via
iTunes and the App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mobile software upgrades will be part of Apple&#8217;s next
iPhone, which analysts including Munster have predicted will be
released by October. The iPhone is Apple&#8217;s best-selling product,
accounting for 58 percent of its revenue last quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Lion &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple also showed off its upcoming Mountain Lion operating
system for the Mac, which will be released next month for
$19.99. The software includes many features from the iPhone and
iPad, including a notification system so text messages sent to
an iPhone or iPad will show up on the Mac as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes to the mobile and Mac software underscore a
broader push by Apple to make its products work more seamlessly
together, encouraging customers to purchase multiple devices.
Users can safeguard documents and files on Apple&#8217;s iCloud
storage service and access them from whichever machine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That fosters &#8220;stickiness&#8221; so that users won&#8217;t want to
switch to another product because of all the time and effort
they have invested with Apple&#8217;s gadgets, said Chris Jones, an
analyst at market researcher Canalys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s event highlighted the difficulty Apple has keeping
new product details secret. Many of the biggest announcements
from the day had leaked out in the weeks leading up to the
developer conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MacBook Revisions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case in point: an updated MacBook Pro. Apple is tweaking
its laptops as other computer makers such as Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)
prepare machines that feature the new version of Microsoft&#8217;s
Windows this year. Apple introduced a thinner, lighter MacBook
Pro that boasts high-definition screens and sells for at least
$2,199. It starts shipping today, Apple said. The MacBook Pros
feature more powerful chips from Intel Corp. (INTC), graphics
capabilities from Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) and an HDMI port for playing
videos to TVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MacBook Pro will boast 7 hours of battery life and as
much as 768 gigabytes of flash memory, Apple said. The company
updated the existing line of MacBook Pros, which will also boast
faster chips. These will sell for $1,199 to $2,199. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New MacBook Airs -- which are thinner and less pricey than
Pros -- will sell for $999 to $1,499, Apple said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While they&#8217;re not dramatic new hardware, these were
important improvements to make for Apple to be ahead of the
competition,&#8221; said Walter Piecyk, an analyst with BTIG LLC in
New York. &#8220;These incremental improvements are going to further
integrate the Apple experience into the user&#8217;s life.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Facebook Apps &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event kicked off Apple&#8217;s weeklong conference for
developers who make the software that populates its App Store.
More than 30 billion apps have been downloaded from Apple
digital store, and developers have received $5 billion from the
sales, Apple said today. Apple keeps 30 percent of the revenue
raised from app-store sales and developers get the rest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The success of Apple&#8217;s App Store has helped create a market
for applications that will reach $58 billion in 2014, according
to Gartner Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The products we make, combined with the apps you create,
can fundamentally change the world,&#8221; Cook said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fellow technology companies also are trying to lure the
developers. Even as Apple works more closely with Facebook, it
will also compete with the owner of the world&#8217;s most popular
social network in sales of apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook opened an online bazaar last week. Google&#8217;s store
has more than 500,000 apps, while Microsoft has lined up design
firms, recruited interns and sent engineers on an around-the-
world road show to line the shelves of its app store. Google
hosts its own developers conference in San Francisco June 27-29. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Apple&#8217;s first developer conference since co-founder
Steve Jobs died in October. Last year&#8217;s event, where he
introduced Apple&#8217;s iCloud service, was the last Apple event he
led. Jobs had used previous conferences to introduce such
products as earlier iPhone models. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)&#8217;s NBC unit and Dial
Global Inc. (DIAL) are creating the NBC Sports Radio Network to
broadcast national and regional programming, challenging Walt
Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s ESPN Radio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The radio network, starting in September, will air hourly
sports-news updates, daily features and full-length shows, New
York-based NBC and Dial Global said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Comcast, NBC has moved to challenge ESPN, the most-
watched television sports channel, with NBC Sports Network and
Golf Channel. The company has extended rights agreements to
continue airing the Olympics and National Hockey League games.
NBC Sports Radio Network will provide stations with regional and
national coverage, the companies said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comcast, based in Philadelphia, lost 1.1 percent to $29.94
at the close in New York. The stock has climbed 26 percent this
year. Dial, a radio program distributor based in New York, fell
15 percent to $2.56. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sports-radio accord builds on agreements between NBC
and Dial to create a 24-hour NBC News Radio network, the Weather
Channel and NBC Olympics. NBC News Radio Network will feature
live, breaking-news simulcasts from NBC and MSNBC, reports from
NBC News correspondents, and broadcasts by Brian Williams, the
anchor of &#8220;NBC Nightly News,&#8221; and David Gregory, the anchor of
&#8220;Meet the Press.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Volkswagen
AG (VOW) are leading companies selling $2.6 billion in bonds tied to
household and business borrowing as this year&#8217;s issuance
outpaces 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, plans to sell
$750 million of bonds tied to credit-card debt set to mature in
five years. The securities are rated AAA by Standard  Poor&#8217;s
and Fitch Ratings, according to a person familiar with the
transaction who declined to be identified because terms aren&#8217;t
set. The New York-based bank is managing the sale, with HSBC
Holdings Plc and Royal Bank of Canada, according to a regulatory
filing. Justin Perras, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to immediately comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies have sold about $92 billion of asset-backed bonds
tied to consumer and business lending this year, compared with
$87 billion in the first six months of 2011, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Debt tied to credit-card sales account
for $11 billion of 2012 issuance, compared with $45 for
automobile debt and $7 billion for notes backed by student
loans, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors are demanding 61 basis points more yield than on
Treasuries to hold top-ranked asset-backed securities linked to
everything from auto loans to timeshare payments, according to a
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. The spread is down from 93
basis points at the end of last year. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spreads Narrow &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top-ranked debt backed by auto loans is yielding 56 basis
points more than Treasuries, down from 65 basis points on May
15, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. The
securities returned 0.07 percent in May. That compares with 0.33
percent for bonds tied to credit-card payments and 0.58 percent
for investment-grade corporate bonds, index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volkswagen, based in Wolfsburg, Germany, plans to sell a 1
billion euro ($1.25 billion) lease bond, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The deal, run by JPMorgan and Royal Bank
of Scotland Plc, may be all fixed-rate securities graded AAA by
SP and Fitch with a 1.5 percent yield, according to a person
familiar with offering who declined to be identified because
terms aren&#8217;t set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CNH Global NV (CNH), the part-owned unit of truck and tractor
manufacturer Fiat Industrial SpA, is planning to sell $750
million of bonds backed by loans for equipment. The deal is run
by Credit Suisse AG, Credit Agricole SA and RBS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Stable&#8217; Outlook &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Amsterdam-based company sold $996 million of equipment
bonds in March and $811 million in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP boosted CNH&#8217;s outlook to &#8220;stable&#8221; in March, citing
better-than-expected 2011 financial results, and that Fiat
Industrial&#8217;s diversification &#8220;should offset&#8221; weaker truck
sales in Southern Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is also planning to sell a conduit bond, according
to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,
backed by loans including California&#8217;s Palazzo Westwood Village;
Doubletree Corp.&#8217;s Wit Hotel in Chicago; 100 West Putnam in
Greenwich, Connecticut; Louisville, Kentucky&#8217;s Jefferson Mall;
and Southpark Mall in Colonial Heights, Virginia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s Investors Service said last week the gap is
widening between strong shopping centers that can attract
tenants and those that may be on a path toward liquidation amid
&#8220;sluggish&#8221; economic growth. Moody&#8217;s is changing how it
assesses the weakest shopping-mall loans packaged into
commercial-mortgage bonds to compensate for a growing number of
properties that may struggle to survive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SolarCity Corp., the developer of rooftop solar power
systems that is working on its initial public offering, plans to
use solar panel installations on Wal-Mart Stores Inc. in
Arizona, California, Colorado, and 150 leases in pipeline as
collateral for first securitization, Asset-Backed Alert reported
last week. The San Mateo, California-based company may have $3
billion of commercial, residential solar-equipment leases ready
to securitize by year-end 2015. The size and timing haven&#8217;t been
determined. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Maria Kolesnikova" date="Jun 11, 2012 10:23 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-11/goldman-sees-a-29-return-from-commodities-over-12-months.html"><headline>Goldman Sees a 29% Return From Commodities Over 12 Months</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) predicted a
29 percent return over the next year from the Standard  Poor&#8217;s
GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index, led by energy and industrial-
metals investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European policy makers will be able to contain the euro-area
debt crisis, while recovery in the U.S. and China is set to
continue, Jeffrey Currie, head of commodities research in New
York, said today in a report. Returns may be 41 percent in a
year for energy investments, compared with 23 percent for
industrial metals and 18 percent for precious metals, while
agriculture is forecast to lose 14 percent, the report showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Although the macroeconomic backdrop still remains
uncertain, particularly in Europe, we believe that the selloff
in commodity prices is likely overdone and the price risks are
shifting more to the upside,&#8221; Currie wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities as measured by the SP GSCI Enhanced Commodity
Index dropped 13 percent in May and are down 9.1 percent this
year on mounting concern that Europe&#8217;s widening debt crisis will
derail global growth and curb demand for commodities. Coffee,
natural gas, cotton and crude oil paced declines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs cut its three-month outlook on commodities to
neutral from overweight on March 28, while sticking with an
overweight recommendation for a one-year period. Commodities may
return 13 percent in a year, the bank said in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currie correctly advised investors to reduce commodity
holdings on April 15, 2011, before prices slumped 6.9 percent in
May, the first monthly drop in eight. On March 29, 2011, Currie
said commodities may rise more than estimated 14.3 percent in 12
months. Goldman in December closed its recommendations to buy
the June 2012 copper at a loss of $1,530 a metric ton and the
December 2012 zinc at $298 a ton. Only two out of seven
Goldman&#8217;s trading recommendations are currently making a profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Copper, Gold &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude, gas, copper, aluminum and gold are the bank&#8217;s top
picks, according to the latest report. Copper stockpiles are
declining, especially in leading global consumer China, and the
oil market is tightening, Currie wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Goldman Sachs lowered three-month price forecasts to
$8,000 a ton from $9,000 for copper and to $2,200 a ton from
$2,400 for aluminum, according to a separate report today.
Copper for three-month delivery gained 1.4 percent to $7,393.25
a ton by 3:20 p.m. on the London Metal Exchange and aluminum was
little changed at $1,974 a ton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculators cut combined bullish bets across the SP GSCI
index by 13 percent to this year&#8217;s lowest level in the week
ended June 5, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show.
Hedge-fund bets on declines in copper futures are the highest
since March 2009, according to the CFTC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The financial participation in many markets is now below
what is consistent with the underlying market fundamentals,&#8221;
Currie wrote. &#8220;Physical deleveraging has been an ongoing
process, particularly in Europe since the fourth quarter of last
year, as funding costs remain high.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL) is releasing a fresh
lineup of computers and software tools to woo consumers and keep
developers making applications amid accelerating rivalry from
Google Inc. (GOOG), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and, now, Facebook Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple will use the Worldwide Developers Conference starting
today in San Francisco to debut Mac computers with high-
definition screens, as well as features for the software that
powers its iPhone and iPad. Phil Schiller, Apple&#8217;s senior vice
president of product marketing, will probably emcee the keynote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leadership in the consumer-electronics industry hinges on a
company&#8217;s ability to get developers to put its products first
when building the next big application, such as &#8220;Angry Birds&#8221;
or &#8220;Shazam.&#8221; With more than 600,000 downloadable games,
magazines and productivity tools, Apple is the application
leader. Microsoft is playing catch-up before the release of its
next operating system, Google will host a developers conference
this month and Facebook just opened its own store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not just a battle for consumers&#8217; hearts and minds --
it&#8217;s a battle for developers to get that next great application
to be available first and foremost on their platform,&#8221; said
Charles Golvin, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc. who
studies the mobile technology industry. &#8220;These companies are
duking it out.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The success of Apple&#8217;s App Store has helped create an
economy for downloading mobile applications that will reach $58
billion in sales in 2014, according to Gartner Inc. More than 25
billion apps have been downloaded from Apple&#8217;s store, and
developers have received $4 billion from the sales, according to
Cupertino, California-based Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bigger iPhone &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook is the latest to join the mobile app-store craze,
opening an online bazaar last week. The Google Play store boasts
more than 500,000 apps, while Microsoft has lined up design
firms, recruited interns and sent engineers on an around-the-
world road show to line the shelves of its app store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this week&#8217;s event, Apple will probably signal a bigger
screen for the next iPhone, its best-selling product, by telling
developers to write future applications that can work on a
larger surface, said Andy Hargreaves, an analyst at Pacific
Crest Securities Inc. in Portland, Oregon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple also plans to announce a deal that lets users quickly
post pictures and other content from phones and tablets to the
profiles on Facebook Inc. (FB)&#8217;s social network, people with
knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trudy Muller, a spokeswoman for Apple, declined to comment,
as did Derick Mains, a spokesman for Menlo Park, California-
based Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cook&#8217;s Turn &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year&#8217;s event, where co-founder Steve Jobs introduced
Apple&#8217;s iCloud service, was the last Apple event he led before
he died in October. He had used previous conferences to
introduce such products as earlier iPhone models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year&#8217;s conference, running June 11-15, will give Chief
Executive Officer Tim Cook a chance to outline his vision for
why developers should continue to build for Apple rather than
competitors, said Carl Howe, an analyst at Yankee Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers will look for signs that Apple will announce
added uses for Siri, its voice-recognition technology, said
Corey Reese, the CEO and co-founder of Ness Computing Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Everybody in the industry pays very close attention to
what direction they go,&#8221; said Reese, who will be attending the
event and whose company makes an application that provides
restaurant recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple will use the event to introduce a new mapping
application that would replace Google Maps, which it has used
since 2007, a person familiar with the plans said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Google Standoff &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change may help shunt advertising revenue toward Apple
and away from Google, said Forrester&#8217;s Golvin. Apple also is
adding Baidu Inc. (BIDU)&#8217;s search engine as an alternative to Google
for iPhone users in China, people said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes highlight Apple&#8217;s growing rivalry with Google,
which has joined companies including Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) to
challenge the iPhone and iPad. Smartphones running Google&#8217;s
Android operating system accounted for 56 percent of global
sales in the first three months of the year, compared with 23
percent for the iPhone, according to Gartner. Google hosts its
own developers conference at the same location in San Francisco
June 27-29. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At today&#8217;s event, Cook and other Apple executives also will
showcase the latest lineup of Mac computers, including MacBook
Pro laptops that will sport high-definition screens and speedier
chips made by Intel Corp. (INTC), people familiar with the plans said
last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Outpacing Hewlett-Packard &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Releasing the new computers puts Apple ahead of rival PC
makers such as Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) and Dell Inc. (DELL), which will
introduce machines later in the year to work with Microsoft&#8217;s
coming Windows 8 release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple rose 1.2 percent to $587.28 at 9:32 a.m. in New York.
Through yesterday, the shares had increased 43 percent this
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After today&#8217;s announcements, starting at 10 a.m. in San
Francisco, the weeklong event is closed to the public and media.
Developers pay about $1,600 apiece to attend and spend the week
meeting with Apple engineers to learn about new features that
are being introduced and how they can integrate them into their
applications. More than 5,200 people attended Apple&#8217;s developers
conference last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is when Apple releases their information and it&#8217;s
the one time of year when you know you&#8217;re going to get more of
an idea about what they are up to,&#8221; said Matt Murphy, a partner
at Kleiner Perkins Caufield  Byers, which invests in companies
that make mobile applications. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Golf Association added to
its roster of corporate sponsors for this week&#8217;s U.S. Open,
reaching a three-year partnership with Chevron Corp. (CVX) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second-largest U.S. energy company will pay $4 million
annually to become an official USGA partner, according to two
people familiar with the sponsorship, which includes print,
broadcast and digital media purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement will use marquee events to promote education
by showcasing the science and technology principles behind the
game, Glenn Weckerlin, Chevron&#8217;s director of marketing, said.
There will be learning stations to teach about the science of
golf -- such as aerodynamics, velocity and lift of golf balls,
and measuring the slope and acceleration of putting greens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When you see the kids interact with these things, it just
really comes to life for them,&#8221; Sarah Hirshland, the USGA&#8217;s
director of business affairs, said in a telephone interview.
&#8220;Our goal is for that to be an incentive for them to care about
and better understand the game.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Ramon, California-based Chevron and the USGA, which
governs the game of golf along with the Royal  Ancient Golf
Club of St. Andrews, Scotland, will create content aimed at
advancing childhood science, technology, education and math
programs -- known as STEM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We employ a number of engineers and scientists,&#8221;
Hirshland said. &#8220;This is an inherent part of what we need in
the future. The monetary component is not the driving force
behind this.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Drive Interest &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The programs are designed to drive student interest in STEM
education and introduce them to the game&#8217;s fundamental elements,
Hirshland said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to having a hospitality presence and golf
outings at the U.S. Open, U.S. Women&#8217;s Open and U.S. Senior Open
venues, Chevron will sponsor a STEM Zone area for students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before forming the partnership, Chevron had similar
learning centers at U.S. PGA Tour events including the Pebble
Beach National Pro-Am, the Northern Trust (NTRS) Open in Los Angeles
and the Zurich Classic of New Orleans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was a pretty fast discussion,&#8221; Weckerlin said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s a nice fit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron joins American Express Co. (AXP), International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM), Lexus International Ltd. and Rolex Watch Co. as
official USGA sponsors. Hirshland said the ruling body isn&#8217;t
actively seeking new partnerships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re very comfortable with five,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But to
say never is a big word.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, Chevron declined to renew its title
sponsorship of Tiger Woods&#8217;s annual World Challenge event in
Thousand Oaks, California. Chevron had sponsored the tournament
and Woods&#8217;s charitable foundation since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We rode out the issues that took place halfway through
the deal,&#8221; Weckerlin said. &#8220;If we really had an issue with
Tiger&#8217;s foundation, we would have gotten out two years earlier.
It served a purpose at the time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, is in talks to sell its hedge-fund
administration unit to State Street Corp. (STT), according to a person
with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final agreement is yet to be reached, said the person,
who declined to be identified because the negotiations are
private. The unit provides fund accounting, valuation and risk-
management for hedge funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators including the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission have increased oversight of companies that do
business with hedge funds in response to convicted fraudster
Bernard Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme and industry losses in 2008.
State Street, the third-biggest custody bank, added $170 billion
of hedge-fund and private-equity assets when it bought Mourant
International Finance Administration, based in Jersey in the
Channel Islands, in December 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a sensible move for Goldman Sachs in getting out
of this largely unglamorous business, in which increased
regulation and oversight from SEC has put additional risk on the
administrator without necessarily generating the commensurate
revenues,&#8221; said Christopher Wheeler, analyst with Mediobanca
SpA in London. Such sales have &#8220;become a common practice for
U.S. banks since the Madoff scandal, following a similar trend
in Europe.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State Street had $506 billion in hedge-fund assets under
administration at the end of March, the Boston-based company
said in an April 30 presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As a matter of policy, we don&#8217;t comment on rumor or
speculation,&#8221; Hannah Grove, a State Street spokeswoman, said in
an e-mail. A Goldman Sachs spokeswoman in London declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combined business would have about $700 billion in
assets, according to the Financial Times, which reported the
talks earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon said traders in a London unit responsible
for a $2 billion loss didn&#8217;t understand the risks they were
taking and weren&#8217;t properly monitored. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This portfolio morphed into something that, rather than
protect the firm, created new and potentially larger risks,&#8221;
Dimon said in prepared remarks ahead of his appearance tomorrow
before the Senate Banking Committee. &#8220;We have let a lot of
people down, and we are sorry for it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers plan to question Dimon at hearings this week and
next about the bank&#8217;s blunders on credit derivatives in its
chief investment office after he initially called April news
reports about the trades &#8220;a complete tempest in a teapot.&#8221;
Shares of the bank, the biggest in the U.S., have dropped 17
percent since Dimon disclosed the mounting losses May 10,
lopping about $26.5 billion from the firm&#8217;s market value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;CIO&#8217;s traders did not have the requisite understanding of
the risks they took&#8221; on bets that were supposed to hedge credit
risk, Dimon said. &#8220;When the positions began to experience
losses in March and early April, they incorrectly concluded that
those losses were the result of anomalous and temporary market
movements.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, who&#8217;s also set to face the House Financial Services
Committee on June 19, finds himself in the middle of a renewed
debate about whether the so-called Volcker rule, which would
curb trading by deposit-taking banks, should be tightened.
While Dimon didn&#8217;t comment on the size of the loss from the
trades, he said the second quarter would be &#8220;solidly
profitable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Lessons Learned&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The lessons learned from the recent failures in risk
management at JPMorgan Chase will be an important input into
efforts to design the Dodd-Frank Act reforms including a strong
Volcker rule,&#8221; U.S. Treasury Department Deputy Secretary Neal Wolin told the Senate panel last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank instructed the CIO in December to reduce its risk-
weighted assets to prepare for new international capital rules.
Instead, the office in mid-January &#8220;embarked on a complex
strategy that entailed adding positions that it believed would
offset the existing ones,&#8221; Dimon said. The portfolio instead
got larger and the problem got worse, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon said that the risk committee structures and processes
were not as robust in the CIO as they should have been. The
division&#8217;s London team built up a book of credit derivatives
that became so large that employees couldn&#8217;t unwind it without
roiling markets or incurring large losses, current and former
executives have said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Poorly Conceived&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategy for reducing the portfolio was &#8220;poorly
conceived and vetted,&#8221; Dimon said. &#8220;The strategy was not
carefully analyzed or subjected to rigorous stress testing
within CIO and was not reviewed outside&#8221; the division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[To read Dimon&#8217;s full testimony, click here] &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk oversight personnel were &#8220;in transition&#8221; and the
derivatives credit portfolio responsible for the loss should
have &#8220;gotten more scrutiny from both senior management and the
firmwide risk control function,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The position of chief risk officer inside the CIO was a
revolving door, with at least five executives holding the job in
six years, people familiar with the matter said. Irvin Goldman,
appointed in February and replaced in May, had been fired in
2007 by brokerage Cantor Fitzgerald LP for money-losing bets
that led to a regulatory sanction of the firm, said three people
with knowledge of the matter. Goldman wasn&#8217;t directly accused of
wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Drew, Macris &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew retired after the loss
was disclosed and was replaced by Matt Zames, who was co-head of
fixed-income trading in the investment bank. Zames told staff
that top London-based trading executive Achilles Macris would
hand off duties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When we make mistakes, we take them seriously and often
are our own toughest critic,&#8221; Dimon said. &#8220;While we can never
say we won&#8217;t make mistakes -- in fact, we know we will -- we do
believe this to be an isolated event.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s biggest competitors, including Bank of America
Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo  Co., have said their
corporate investment offices avoid using the kind of derivatives
that led to the trading losses and buy fewer bonds exposed to
credit risk. The rivals said their offices don&#8217;t trade credit-
default swaps on indexes linked to the health of companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Government Probes &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government investigators are scrutinizing how long senior
executives knew about the CIO&#8217;s swelling bets before the losses
approached $2 billion. One focal point is why the CIO&#8217;s so-
called value-at-risk formula used to calculate potential losses
was altered in this year&#8217;s first quarter, cutting the reported
risk by half. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the bank reported first-quarter earnings, the new
model showed an average daily VaR within the CIO of $67 million,
about where it stood in the previous period. Dimon said May 10
that the bank then reviewed the effectiveness of the new model,
deemed it &#8220;inadequate&#8221; and decided to return to the previous
version. On that basis, VaR doubled to $129 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government investigations of JPMorgan include the Federal
Reserve&#8217;s study of internal oversight, the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency&#8217;s look into trading, and the
Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s examination of why the bank
changed internal risk gauges this year. The Department of
Justice and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission also are
conducting inquiries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors and bankers, including Dimon, have speculated
that the loss may hurt efforts to soften restrictions imposed by
the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, including the law&#8217;s so-called Volcker
rule, which limits lenders from making bets with their own money
and was designed to head off a repeat of the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;California-blend gasoline in Los
Angeles gained after Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) was said to be repairing
a hydrotreater line at the Torrance refinery in Southern
California after a leak ignited a fire at the unit yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A contractor was repairing a light gasoil feed line to the
hydrotreater at the 150,000-barrel-a-day refinery following the
fire yesterday, a person familiar with operations there said.
Gesuina Paras, an Exxon spokeswoman at the plant, declined in an
e-mail to comment on the details of the blaze. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The cause of the event is under investigation,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;There was no impact to production and no injuries to
personnel.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discount for California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in
Los Angeles narrowed 0.75 cent to 5.25 cents a gallon against
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 4:14 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The fuel weakened 2.5
cents yesterday after Tesoro Corp. (TSO) finished planned work at the
97,000-barrel-a-day Los Angeles refinery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbob in San Francisco dropped 3 cents to 5 cents a gallon
below gasoline futures on speculation that supplies of the motor
fuel increased last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasoline inventories on the U.S. West Coast, known as the
Padd 5 region, rose by the most since January, jumping 5 percent
to 27 million barrels in the week ended June 8, according to the
American Petroleum Institute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend, or CARB, diesel in Los Angeles slipped
0.25 cent to a 4.25-cent-a-gallon premium against Nymex heating
oil futures. The same fuel in San Francisco was unchanged at a
6.5-cent premium. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
Portland, Oregon, widened 2 cents to 7 cents a gallon below
futures. Low-sulfur diesel in Portland gained 2 cents to a
premium of 5 cents a gallon versus heating oil futures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) began to
plot its Washington damage control strategy in the wake of last
month&#8217;s $2 billion trading loss, the bank realized it needed
some help with Republicans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although traditionally sympathetic to Wall Street,
Republican lawmakers in both the House and Senate not only
weren&#8217;t rushing to JPMorgan&#8217;s defense, some were agitating for
congressional hearings and investigations. Republican aides
acknowledged privately that lawmakers were enjoying that Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon -- a Democrat once known as
President Barack Obama&#8217;s favorite banker -- was having a
comeuppance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s government relations unit countered quickly: Mel Martinez, a former Republican senator who is a regional chairman
for the bank, was called up from Florida to talk with some old
colleagues. Nate Gatten, a former Fannie Mae lobbyist who works
in JPMorgan&#8217;s London office, flew back to Washington and checked
into a hotel for an extended stay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They jumped in to the fray, as the bank fielded some 150
inquiries from congressional offices and agencies. The team
includes several other Republicans and prominent Democrats, like
the head of JPMorgan&#8217;s Washington office, Naomi Camper, a former
senior staff member for Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim
Johnson, and Peter Scher, a former Clinton administration
official, who oversees government relations globally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First Sign &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon&#8217;s testimony before the Senate Banking Committee
tomorrow will be the first sign of whether JPMorgan&#8217;s efforts
have been effective in tamping down the political firestorm set
off by the trading flap. Unlike other large banks who tend to
hire high-powered consultants and spin doctors when faced with a
crisis, JPMorgan is relying mostly on its own in-house team
which Dimon has been building up over the past four years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We wanted to take ownership of this and use our own
people,&#8221; Scher said in an interview. &#8220;We knew that the
concerns and questions were for us alone.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan did hire one outside firm, the BennettGroup, run
by ex-Utah Republican Senator Robert F. Bennett. While Bennett
is still barred from lobbying, the bank has been using P.
Michael Nielsen, a Republican former senior policy adviser on
the Senate Banking Committee, to help answer lawmaker queries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is much at stake for JPMorgan. The trading debacle
has cost the bank some $27 billion in market value and dented
Dimon&#8217;s reputation as the banking executive who most
successfully navigated the 2008 financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heightened scrutiny of the bank has reverberated
throughout the financial industry as regulatory agencies like
the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission
take a new look at tightening regulations like the so-called
Volcker rule banning proprietary trading. Even more broadly,
some argue lawmakers may need to look at new ways to rein in the
largest banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mega Banks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When the best managed, best led bank in the world can
have this kind of blunder happen, it just confirms no matter how
good your management is, no matter how tightly you try to
regulate and oversee these mega banks, they are just too big to
get your arms around,&#8221; said Camden Fine, president of the
Independent Community Bankers of America, a small bank trade
group. &#8220;This is something that the Hill will have to grapple
with.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street has a vested interest in the outcome,
particularly in preventing the furor from convincing regulators
to tighten the Volcker rule, which could limit the kind of
proprietary trading at issue. As a result, JPMorgan&#8217;s large bank
competitors haven&#8217;t moved to take advantage of its troubles.
Some are even helping them strategize about how to deal with the
controversy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goldman Assists &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That includes Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), usually one of
JPMorgan&#8217;s fiercest competitors. According to people with
knowledge of the situation, several of Goldman Sachs&#8217; Washington
lobbyists have been brainstorming with their JPMorgan
counterparts on tactics and messages. One piece of advice: Pull
the Band-Aid off fast and explain in as much detail as possible
what happened, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That comes from experience. Goldman was in a similar
situation two years ago when its CEO, Lloyd Blankfein, was
summoned before a Senate panel to discuss the firm&#8217;s role in
fueling the subprime loan crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, though contrite at times, didn&#8217;t win many
plaudits for his testimony, which often relied on technical
definitions of market making to explain why the bank was on the
other side of a trade from its clients. Those answers so angered
Senator Carl Levin that the Michigan Democrat accused Blankfein
of misleading Congress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Franchise Protection&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the work JPMorgan is doing these days to explain
the loss isn&#8217;t considered lobbying in the traditional sense.
They aren&#8217;t pushing for legislation or weighing in with
regulators on the issues. Instead, the bank is in what lobbyists
call a &#8220;franchise protection mode:&#8221; trying to push its story
about what happened and pave the way for a smooth hearing for
their CEO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the bank&#8217;s key arguments to lawmakers and Obama
administration officials has been that the trading loss, while
large, is not close to being an event that could shake the
financial system or even imperil the bank. While JPMorgan and
its shareholders are feeling pain, they stress, no taxpayer
funds are on the hook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In private conversations with lawmakers and staff, the bank
has fielded questions about deposits, emphasizing that customer
deposits were never in jeopardy. The bank is also reminding them
that there was plenty of capital to cover this type of loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s Washington office has also been warning
lawmakers and staff that Dimon may not be able to provide
answers to all their questions. JPMorgan reports earnings in
mid-July, so Dimon won&#8217;t be able to speculate on the eventual
extent of the losses. The bank has said the tally was at least
$2 billion and could grow. There is also an internal review
under way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is not an issue you lobby on,&#8221; said Scher. &#8220;There
are legitimate questions from members of Congress and agencies,
and our strategy has been to be as open and as responsive as we
can be.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is leading
banks preparing bond offerings tied to commercial property loans
as Wall Street seeks to offload mortgages stockpiled during the
past two months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lender will issue securities linked to debt ranging
from a DoubleTree by Hilton hotel in Queens, New York to a mall
in Louisville, Kentucky, according to a regulatory filing.
Morgan Stanley (MS), Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Barclays Plc (BARC) and UBS AG (UBSN)
are also planning sales, according to people familiar with the
offerings who declined to be identified because the deals
haven&#8217;t been announced. JPMorgan&#8217;s transaction may be marketed
as soon as next week, the people said. Spokesmen for the banks
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street banks have been challenged by price swings of
the debt as Europe&#8217;s fiscal imbalances fuel volatility, making
it hard to offer property owners consistent terms. The extra
yield investors demand to own top-ranked commercial-mortgage
bonds instead of Treasuries soared to 210 basis points, the
highest in more than three months, on June 4, according to a
Barclays index. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For the CMBS market to be fully functional as a first
choice for borrowers, we need to get to a point where there is
more consistency in the terms that originators can offer and
deliver,&#8221; Scott Singer, a principal at the Singer  Bassuk
Organization LLC, a real-estate firm that represents property
owners and developers arranging financing, said in an interview
last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Profit Margins &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wider spreads can eat into profit margins on commercial-
mortgage bond offerings, hindering new lending and choking off
funding to borrowers with loans coming due. More than $30
billion in the debt matures this year, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Wells Fargo  Co. sold
top-ranked debt maturing in about 10 years to yield 140 basis
points more than the benchmark swap last week. In April, the
spread on similar newly issued debt was 115 basis points,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks have arranged about $11 billion of the deals this
year, compared with $28 billion in all of 2011, Bloomberg data
show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of commercial-mortgage bonds reached a record $232
billion in 2007, helping fuel a boom in property prices,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Issuance plummeted to
$12.2 billion in 2008 as souring subprime-home loans infected
credit markets. The market stayed shut until November 2009,
choking off funding to borrowers with debt coming due. Banks
arranged $11.5 billion in 2010, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forecasts for 2012 issuance range from Wells Fargo&#8217;s $25
billion to Credit Suisse Group AG&#8217;s projection of as much as $45
billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) brought
back Mark Schwartz to run its Asian business from Beijing, after
an 11-year hiatus during which he ran George Soros&#8217;s hedge-fund
group and started an investment firm with Raj Rajaratnam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwartz, 57, will also be vice chairman of the firm, New
York-based Goldman Sachs said in a statement today. He fills a
role left by J. Michael Evans, who served as chairman of the
region since 2004 and is now based in New York as vice chairman
and global head of growth markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Asia chief will be Goldman Sachs&#8217;s first regional
chairman to be based in Beijing, signaling the growing
importance of the world&#8217;s second-largest economy as the Wall
Street bank targets emerging markets to bolster revenue. Rival
JPMorgan Chase  Co. in April said Jeff Urwin, global head of
investment banking, would move to Hong Kong and take on the
additional role of Asia CEO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Unquestionably, China will continue to lead global growth
in the next few years,&#8221; Cao Xuefeng, head of research at
Chengdu-based Huaxi Securities Co., said by telephone. The
nation&#8217;s economic expansion &#8220;will translate into greater
business opportunity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwartz, who had joined Goldman Sachs&#8217;s investment banking
unit in 1979, will again be on the management committee, which
he served on from 1999 until his departure from the firm in
2001. He was head of capital markets from 1991 to 1997, when he
moved to Tokyo to oversee Japan operations. He was chairman of
Asia from 1999 until 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Important Relationships &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He played a critical role in helping to build our
businesses across Asia Pacific,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein said in the statement. &#8220;Those experiences and
relationships will be even more important as we focus on
continuing to help our clients and grow our franchise across the
region.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, who began cutting costs in 2011 as revenue
declined for the second straight year, is counting on
international expansion and a market rebound to restore profit
growth. The firm derived $3.9 billion of net revenue from Asia
last year, or about 13 percent of the total, down from 18
percent in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In China, Goldman Sachs in 2004 became the first Wall
Street bank to form a local securities venture with management
control. The nation last month agreed to let foreign banks raise
their stakes in domestic securities firms to as much as 49
percent from 33 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Most Dynamic &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as stock and bond underwriting, the U.S. firm is
expanding its private-equity, asset management and institutional
brokerage businesses in China. Through its local partner,
Goldman Sachs won approval in late 2010 to offer investment
products, including to institutional investors and affluent
clients. It estimates that of all accounts opened by wealthy
people at the firm globally last year, more than a quarter were
in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Asia Pacific region continues to represent many of
the most dynamic and important economies in the world,&#8221;
Schwartz said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwartz has been chairman of investment firm MissionPoint
Capital Partners since 2006. He was a senior adviser to Soros
Fund Management LLC from 2002 and then president and CEO from
2003 to 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He started an investment firm in early 2006 with partners
including Rajaratnam and Rajat Gupta. The blended hedge fund and
private equity company called Taj Capital Partners Asia Fund LP
planned to hire a 50-person team to invest about $2 billion in
South Asia, according to an investor prospectus. By December
2006, the plans had changed, with the fund being renamed New
Silk Route and the size reduced to $1.34 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam was convicted of insider trading last year and
former Goldman Sachs director Gupta is currently on trial for
leaking tips to the Galleon Group LLC co-founder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new job, Schwartz will work with Masanori Mochida,
president of Goldman Sachs Japan, and David Ryan, president of
Asia Pacific ex-Japan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rajat Gupta, the former Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) director accused of insider trading, lost a bid
to have a jury hear wiretaps of Goldman Sachs executive David Loeb tipping Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta, who has pleaded not guilty, is on trial in federal
court in Manhattan for allegedly passing tips to Rajaratnam
about Goldman Sachs and Procter  Gamble Co. (PG), where he was also
a director. U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff made the preliminary
ruling yesterday, while allowing Gupta to submit legal briefs on
why the evidence should be allowed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam got some of his illegal tips from Loeb, Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s head of Asia equity sales in New York, defense attorney
Gary Naftalis has said in court. The lawyer has argued to the
jury that the &#8220;wrong man&#8221; is on trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the defense about to rest its case, David Frankel,
another lawyer for Gupta, argued at a hearing yesterday after
jurors left for the day that Gupta should be allowed to play
&#8220;substantial&#8221; wiretaps made on Aug. 7 and Aug. 22 of 2008 by
the Federal Bureau of Investigation. On the calls, Loeb is
passing material nonpublic information to Rajaratnam about Intel
Corp. (INTC) and Apple Inc. (AAPL), Frankel said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is substantial evidence that supports the argument
that Mr. Loeb could&#8217;ve been the source of Goldman Sachs tips,&#8221;
Frankel said in court. &#8220;The tapes tell the story that Loeb gets
the information, which is confidential to Intel, and he reaches
out to Mr. Rajaratnam.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Preliminary Ruling &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rakoff, after issuing his preliminary ruling rejecting the
evidence, told defense lawyers that they may submit a legal
brief last night explaining why the tapes and e-mails aren&#8217;t
hearsay and should be admitted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is an attempt to prove an alternative view of the
underlying facts and blatant hearsay,&#8221; Rakoff told Gupta&#8217;s
lawyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to
comment on yesterday&#8217;s decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta, who ran McKinsey  Co. from 1994 to 2003, is accused
of leaking secret tips to Rajaratnam about Goldman Sachs and
PG. Rajaratnam was convicted of insider trading last year and
sentenced to 11 years in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tips in question involve Goldman Sachs earnings in the
first quarter of 2007 and fourth quarter of 2008. Another
involves a $5 billion Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/B) investment in
Goldman Sachs on Sept. 23, 2008. Prosecutors have said Gupta
told Rajaratnam that Cincinnati-based PG planned to sell its
Folgers Coffee unit to J.M. Smucker Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam Smith, a Galleon trader who pleaded guilty and is
cooperating with the U.S., received some of Loeb&#8217;s tips on
Rajaratnam&#8217;s behalf, Frankel said. Loeb, who at the time was a
vice president and had Galleon as a client, stood to profit if
the fund did well, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;You and Adam&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Loeb says, &#8216;Since I&#8217;ve normally given this to Adam to
give to you, this goes to you and Adam,&#8217;&#8221; Frankel quoted from
one wiretap of a conversation between Loeb and Rajaratnam. &#8220;I
give it to a couple of guys on the street, I call you and Adam
first.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defense also seeks to introduce &#8220;urgent&#8221; e-mails Loeb
sent to Rajaratnam, some which involve Henry King, a Goldman
Sachs analyst in Asia, Frankel said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He&#8217;s providing information to Loeb,&#8221; Frankel said. Loeb
&#8220;gets it from King who gets it from his source at Intel,&#8221; the
lawyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant U.S. Attorney Reed Brodsky argued that the
defense was attempting to insert Loeb into the case and that
playing the wiretaps and showing the e-mails without explanation
would confuse jurors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Loeb&#8217;s Statements &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defense argued that the conversations and e-mails
should be introduced into evidence as Loeb&#8217;s statements against
his interests and as statements of co-conspirators in a crime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government hasn&#8217;t accused Loeb and King of wrongdoing.
Two people familiar with the probe said in February that both
men are the subject of a criminal investigation by U.S.
authorities in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rakoff is also weighing whether to admit a wiretapped
conversation from Oct. 2, 2008, between Rajaratnam and a Galleon
employee in which they discuss Gupta&#8217;s $10 million loss in a
Galleon fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Naftalis, Rajaratnam says on the wiretap, &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t tell him that I took the equity out&#8221; of the fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta&#8217;s lawyers contend that&#8217;s a reference to Rajaratnam&#8217;s
willingness to lie and create cover stories. The tape would help
the defense argue that the jury shouldn&#8217;t believe other
Rajaratnam statements that suggest Gupta was his source of
illicit information, Naftalis said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defense may complete its testimony today. Closing
arguments will begin tomorrow, Rakoff said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Gupta, 11-cr-00907, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon, chief executive officer
of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), is scheduled to testify tomorrow before
Congress about the bank&#8217;s $2 billion loss on derivatives trading
at its chief investment office. Here&#8217;s a chronology of events
leading to the disclosure and the aftermath. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some dates are approximate and are subject to revision as
more information becomes available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2004------------------------------------------------------- &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nov. 13: JPMorgan completes takeover of Bank One Corp., run by
Jamie Dimon. He becomes CEO of JPMorgan the following year.
Global treasury unit, led by Ina Drew, is broken out of
JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bank and expands to manage combined firm&#8217;s
more diverse balance sheet. Drew begins reporting to Dimon at
year-end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2005--------------------------------------------------------- &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;February: Ina Drew&#8217;s title changes to chief investment officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Date unknown: Bruno Iksil, whose trades play a central role in
adding risk to CIO, joins JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2006--------------------------------------------------------- &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan. 18: Dimon says value-at-risk, or VaR, is &#8220;a very bad
number if you think it actually represents risk.&#8221; The number
probably will climb, according to Dimon, who says, &#8220;We are
going to build our businesses, and therefore, over time, we&#8217;ll
be taking more aggregate risk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Date unknown: Achilles Macris joins JPMorgan, becomes leader of
strategy that builds credit risk in CIO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2007--------------------------------------------------------- &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Date unknown: CIO bets against an index of subprime mortgage
bonds and earns about $1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nov. 26: Barry Zubrow becomes chief risk officer. Also late in
the year, Irvin Goldman, brother-in-law of Zubrow, loses job at
Cantor Fitzgerald LP after money-losing bets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dec. 31: Securities held in JPMorgan&#8217;s CIO and treasury reported
at $76 billion. Corporate division, which includes CIO and
treasury results, has net loss of $150 million for the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2008--------------------------------------------------------- &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mar. 16: Assets managed by CIO expand as JPMorgan agrees to buy
Bear Stearns Cos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 25: Assets managed by CIO increase again as JPMorgan buys
Washington Mutual. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;November: Macris&#8217;s group begins placing bigger bets, becoming
the biggest buyer in some markets. A CIO trader buys about $1.1
billion of AAA-rated portions of collateralized loan obligations
in November-December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dec. 31: Corporate division finishes year with $1.5 billion
profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2009---------------------------------------------------------- &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Date unknown: In the months after the financial crisis, top
executives raise concerns with Dimon that the CIO&#8217;s risk
management wasn&#8217;t adequate, according to the two executives
familiar with the conversations. William Winters and Steve Black, co-heads of the investment bank, seek more information on
the unit&#8217;s changing risk profile. Dimon responds that the
situation is under control. (The bank says executives never
complained about a specific risk in the CIO&#8217;s office. For a
complete account, click here.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April 16: An analyst queries the rise in JPMorgan&#8217;s risk gauge
during quarterly earnings call. &#8220;I don&#8217;t pay that much
attention to VaR,&#8221; Dimon says. &#8220;A lot of that is just hedge
positions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sept. 29: Winters ousted as co-CEO of investment bank in
shakeup. Jes Staley named CEO of investment bank, Black named
executive chairman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dec. 31: Corporate division ends year with $3.7 billion profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2010--------------------------------------------------------- &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan. 15: &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t focus too much on trading VaR,&#8221; Dimon
tells analysts on an earnings conference call. &#8220;It&#8217;s really not
an accurate measure of risk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April 14: Dimon says on quarterly call that VaR is &#8220;an
inadequate measure of most things.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dec. 31: Macris&#8217;s team books $5 billion annual profit, more than
a quarter of bank&#8217;s net income. CIO finishes year with average
value at risk of $57 million, down from $61 million in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2011--------------------------------------------------------- &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April 4: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency warns banks
to scrutinize computer models for VaR for possible flaws, citing
the risk of financial loss and damage to reputation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nov. 29: One of Iksil&#8217;s concentrated bets on an insurance-like
product produces a large gain less than a month before
expiration as the parent of American Airlines goes bankrupt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dec. 31: Iksil records profit of more than $100 million for the
year. He&#8217;s given more leeway than other traders because of
outsized gains in prior years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2012---------------------------------------------------------- &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;January: JPMorgan changes VaR model for chief investment office.
By the end of the quarter, the new measure shows risk averaging
about half the level that the old model would have indicated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan. 12: John Hogan becomes chief risk officer, replacing Barry
Zubrow, who moves to head of regulatory policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feb. 13: Hogan names new team, with Irvin Goldman as new chief
risk officer for CIO. The following month, Evan Kalimtgis, co-
head of risk management for the CIO securities book, quits after
learning Goldman is his new boss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;March 31: Average value at risk falls by $2 million to $67
million during the first quarter, according to the new, flawed
formula. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April 5: Bloomberg News is first to report Iksil had roiled
markets with CIO positions so large that they were distorting
prices. The Wall Street Journal follows with a report that hedge
funds are taking positions to bet against JPMorgan. The bank
says the CIO hedges structural risks to bring assets and
liabilities &#8220;into better alignment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April 8: JPMorgan, responding to speculation that it&#8217;s engaging
in proprietary trading, says the CIO &#8220;is not focused on short-
term profits.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April 10: The Wall Street Journal reports that Iksil has stopped
making trades. A spokesman says the bank believes its risk is
now effectively balanced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April 13: Bloomberg reports that the CIO&#8217;s trading positions are
so big that they probably can&#8217;t be unwound without losing money
or disrupting markets, and that Dimon supervised a shift in the
CIO&#8217;s office in the pasts five years toward making a profit
rather than protecting the bank from risk. In a quarterly
earnings call, Dimon calls the matter &#8220;a complete tempest in a
teapot.&#8221; JPMorgan posts earnings and distributes VaR data,
which is later withdrawn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May 10: Dimon announces &#8220;egregious&#8221; CIO loss of about
$2 billion and says it may increase by $1 billion in the months
ahead. Bank reverts to old VaR formula, which shows average
daily trading risk at $129 million, almost double what had been
reported. The bank&#8217;s filing shows VaR at $186 million on last
day of March. Dimon says the trading blunder may blunt efforts
to soften pending U.S. regulations that would restrict trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May 11: JPMorgan stock falls 9.3 percent, the most in nine
months. Federal Reserve, Securities and Exchange Commission,
Commodity Futures Trading Commission start reviews of trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May 14: Ina Drew retires as head of CIO. Matt Zames, her
replacement, shakes up the unit&#8217;s leadership. Macris will leave
the firm, Bloomberg reports. Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency says it&#8217;s examining losses and risk management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May 15: Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner calls CIO trading
loss a &#8220;pretty significant risk-management failure.&#8221;
Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation open
inquiries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May 16: The New York Times, citing unidentified people with
knowledge of the matter, reports that the bank&#8217;s trading loss
could rise by 50 percent to as much as $3 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May 17: The Wall Street Journal describes how Dimon learned of
the trading losses and reports that JPMorgan&#8217;s losses may total
$5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May 19: Drew began to lose control of the CIO after contracting
Lyme disease in 2010, which resulted in her taking a leave, the
New York Times reports. In her absence, internal divisions and
&#8220;clashing egos&#8221; contributed to losing trades, the Times says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May 21: JPMorgan halts stock buybacks. Stock price stands 20
percent below levels that prevailed before CIO loss was
announced. Dimon says there&#8217;s no outcome that would be a
&#8220;disaster&#8221; for the bank. &#8220;It&#8217;s ugly, but it&#8217;s going to be
boxed and eventually it&#8217;ll be gone,&#8221; the CEO says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May 22: SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro says bank&#8217;s changes in VaR
are being scrutinized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May 25: Bloomberg reports board risk committee lacks members
with financial risk experience. Wall Street Journal later
reports risk panel may add members. Senate Banking Committee
asks Dimon to testify at June hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May 30: Zames tells CIO staff he&#8217;ll unwind the Special
Investment Group and sell holdings in owner of Ebony magazine,
bankrupt Lightsquared Inc., and Technicolor SA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May 31: Bloomberg reports CIO valued some of its trades at
prices that differed from those at its investment bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 5: CIO may lose $4.2 billion, according to estimate by
International Strategy  Investment Group Inc. Federal Reserve
is providing oversight to JPMorgan&#8217;s &#8220;efforts to manage and de-
risk the portfolio,&#8221; Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 6: Comptroller of the Currency Thomas J. Curry tells Senate
the losses reflect &#8220;inadequate risk management&#8221; in the CIO and
the agency is checking for similar gaps elsewhere in the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 13: Dimon scheduled to testify before Senate Banking
Committee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s $2 billion trading loss was
&#8220;a pretty significant risk-management failure&#8221; that was
manageable because of the bank&#8217;s level of capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loss is &#8220;a good reminder of the inherent uncertainty
you live with&#8221; in financial markets, Geithner said today during
a talk at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. He
said JPMorgan was &#8220;direct and clear and crisp in admitting the
scale of the error.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon testified
before Congress today, spending much of a Senate Banking
Committee hearing questioning the federal regulatory system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon described the trading loss as a hedge that &#8220;morphed
into something I can&#8217;t justify,&#8221; and largely blamed
subordinates for a trading strategy gone wrong. The bank is
looking at clawing back some of the compensation earned by those
responsible, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO), the world&#8217;s
largest Spanish-language broadcaster, advanced for a second day
on speculation the nation&#8217;s antitrust commission will overturn a
January decision blocking an acquisition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares gained 1.3 percent to 54.93 pesos at 2:22 p.m.
in Mexico City trading, pushing the two-day advance to 2.9
percent. A close at that level would mark the biggest two-day
rally since the period ended April 30. The benchmark IPC Index (MEXBOL)
of 35 Mexican companies fell 0.4 percent today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico&#8217;s antitrust commission voted June 6 on Televisa&#8217;s
appeal of a January decision blocking the company&#8217;s acquisition
of a 50 percent stake in Grupo Iusacell SA. The decision hasn&#8217;t
been made public. Traders are buying the stock again on optimism
the ruling will be reversed, said Manuel Jimenez, an analyst
with Banorte Ixe Casa de Bolsa who recommends buying the shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Cofeco&#8217;s decision is going to be favorable,&#8221; Jimenez
said in a telephone interview from Mexico City. &#8220;They should
approve it with some conditions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The botched acquisition has been a drag on the stock
because Televisa had already purchased convertible Iusacell
bonds at the time when the agency, known as Cofeco, rejected the
stake purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $1.6 billion transaction must be modified to address
&#8220;grave risks&#8221; to competition, the antitrust agency said in
Feb. 7 a statement explaining its decision to reject the deal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procter  Gamble Co. (PG), the world&#8217;s
largest consumer-products company, should consider breaking
itself up if it doesn&#8217;t improve earnings this year, an analyst
at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Procter  Gamble, based in Cincinnati, would have a market
value of as much as $208 billion in a breakup based on 2013
earnings estimates, according to analyst Ali Dibadj&#8217;s sum-of-
parts analysis. The company has a current market value of about
$171 billion. A split would improve focus within the separate
units, wrote Dibadj, a New York-based analyst at Sanford
Bernstein. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Procter  Gamble, led by Chief Executive Officer Robert McDonald, said in May it would pull back on spending in emerging
markets to focus on larger regions, where it has lost market
share. The company will gain $10 billion in cost cuts and
savings through 2016, Procter  Gamble said in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Procter  Gamble now has &#8220;an appropriate strategy,&#8221;
the company &#8220;hasn&#8217;t been successful,&#8221; Dibadj said in a
telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of success may be related to the fact that the
cost cuts were just announced, or to Procter  Gamble&#8217;s
management or the macro environment, Dibadj said. &#8220;It could
also be related to the fact that this company is just too
complex,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the size and scale of our business offers
competitive advantages and unique opportunities to win now and
into the future,&#8221; Paul Fox, a spokesman for Procter  Gamble,
said via e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Lost Share&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maker of Tide washing detergent, Ivory soap and Bounty
paper towels may gain more by accelerating sales within
operating units and achieve greater focus in a split than it
would lose in efficiencies, Dibadj said in the note. In the
short term, Procter  Gamble&#8217;s strategy to enter emerging
markets, reduce prices and free up cash for investments may help
&#8220;right the ship,&#8221; Dibadj wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McDonald, who took over almost three years ago, had
previously laid out a growth plan of adding product categories
and markets to help the company expand to 5 billion customers by
2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors may lose patience with McDonald if Procter 
Gamble doesn&#8217;t show improvement next year, Dibadj said in the
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The company has lost share, missed commitments to the
street, missed commitments internally, and is in a much worse
place than I think any of us would have anticipated,&#8221; Dibadj
said. &#8220;Can you hoist that blame just on one person? No, but
there&#8217;s always one person who&#8217;s ultimately responsible.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s current fiscal year ends June 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Procter  Gamble fell 0.3 percent to $62.57 at the close in
New York. The shares have declined 6.2 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Phillips Chemical Co. said
it&#8217;s on schedule to build one of the first new U.S. ethylene
plants in more than a decade, taking advantage of cheap natural
gas and gaining an edge in avoiding a potential labor shortage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Phillips will need about 10,000 engineers and
construction workers to build a new ethylene plant and two
polyethylene factories outside Houston, and another 400 workers
to operate them when they open in 2017, Chief Executive Officer
Peter Cella said today in an interview at the company&#8217;s  Cedar
Bayou facility in Baytown, Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Phillips is racing competitors such as Dow Chemical
Co. (DOW) and Exxon Mobil Corp. to complete the factories in southeast
Texas as gas production from shale rock makes raw materials from
the U.S. among the cheapest globally. With so much production
capacity planned, Cella anticipates a dearth of skilled labor in
the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are first out of the gate,&#8221; Cella said. &#8220;I think
that will serve us well if the set of circumstances comes about
that there is a tight labor market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cella broke ground today on another Cedar Bayou facility,
which will make 1-hexene, an ethylene-derived ingredient in
polyethylene plastic. It will be the world&#8217;s largest, capable of
producing as much as 250,000 metric tons (551 million pounds) a
year, the company said. Construction started in April and is
scheduled to be complete in the first quarter of 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rising Demand &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising U.S. demand for plastics and other ethylene
derivatives may support three or four new projects over the next
decade, Cella said. Any additional capacity would be used to
boost exports to South America and Asia, from about 15 percent
to 20 percent of U.S. ethylene production now, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Thanks to the development of this new resource base
previously locked up in shale rock, there is a new optimism that
has spread across the entire chemical industry,&#8217;&#8221; Cella said at
the ceremony. &#8220;I do see a resurgence in our industry.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Phillips is spending about $5 billion on the
ethylene and polyethylene plants and Cella wouldn&#8217;t disclose the
price of the hexene project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also plans to increase production capacity by
20 percent in February at its gas fractionation plant in Sweeny,
Texas. The plant separates natural gas liquids such as ethane
and propane for use by chemical makers and other customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LyondellBasell Industries NV (LYB) opened the last U.S. ethylene
plant in 2001 in Channelview, Texas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon spent much of his time at a hearing where
U.S. senators aimed to put him on the defensive firing back at
the federal regulatory system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During more than two hours before the Senate Banking
Committee, Dimon described a $2 billion loss in the bank&#8217;s chief
investment office as a hedge that &#8220;morphed into something I
can&#8217;t justify,&#8221; and largely blamed subordinates for a trading
strategy gone wrong. The bank is looking at clawing back some of
the compensation earned by those responsible, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Dimon, one of the most vocal bankers in
challenging stricter regulation, said it would be hard for
federal agencies to decide on a final version of the so-called
Volcker rule, which bans proprietary trading for a bank&#8217;s own
account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be very hard to make a bright-line
distinction between proprietary trading and hedging, because you
can look at almost anything we do and call it one or the
other,&#8221; Dimon said at the hearing in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Complex&#8217; System &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulatory system in the wake of the 2010 Dodd-Frank
overhaul is &#8220;really complex,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;No one can
adjudicate between all the various regulatory agencies and it&#8217;s
not clear to me who has regulatory authority.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the first of two appearances Dimon will make on
Capitol Hill to face lawmakers probing how the largest and most
profitable U.S. bank, often praised for its &#8220;fortress&#8221; balance
sheet, could have taken such risks after coming through the 2008
financial crisis largely unscathed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hearing didn&#8217;t answer some basic questions the Senate
has about the details of the New York-based bank&#8217;s loss, Senator
Richard Shelby, the ranking Republican on the committee, said
afterward: &#8220;We&#8217;ll find that out in due time and we&#8217;ll be able
to tell if they were managing risk or just seeking profits.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Tim Johnson, the panel&#8217;s chairman, a South Dakota
Democrat, said the hearing &#8220;is a good reminder that we can&#8217;t
let down our guard, and we must remain vigilant so we can
continue to have a sound financial system.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid chants from protesters, Dimon arrived shortly before
10 a.m. and began answering questions about the causes of the
loss, which he described as part of a hedging strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;VaR Shift &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon said a new formula for estimating possible losses,
implemented in January, failed to properly account for risk. On
April 13, when he downplayed the risks of trades on a call with
analysts, &#8220;we were still unaware that the model might have
contributed to the problem,&#8221; Dimon said. &#8220;So when we found out
later on, we went back to the old model.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The switch -- and the timing of the firm&#8217;s disclosures --
are the focus of an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange
Commission as the government examines how long senior executives
knew about the CIO&#8217;s swelling bets and losses. Dimon said May 10
that the bank had reviewed the effectiveness of a new VaR model,
deemed it &#8220;inadequate&#8221; and decided to return to the previous
version. On that basis, the unit&#8217;s VaR doubled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s board of directors is looking into events
leading to the loss, Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clawbacks Expected &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When the board finishes its review, which is the
appropriate time to make those decisions, you can expect that we
will take proper corrective action and it is likely there will
be clawbacks,&#8221; Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Dimon, 56, took his seat in the Senate hearing room,
Tighe Barry, 50, a protester with activist group CodePink who
works handling props on movie sets in Los Angeles, yelled,
&#8220;This man is a crook and he needs to go to jail.&#8221;  A few
minutes later, several people rose out of the audience and
started yelling, &#8220;Stop foreclosures now.&#8221; Senators delayed the
hearing for a few minutes as Capitol police removed the
protesters from the room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon told the committee that the bank let traders take
risks they didn&#8217;t understand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[To read Dimon&#8217;s prepared testimony, click here.] &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He expressed regret over losses in the bank&#8217;s chief
investment office, saying that its trading strategy was &#8220;poorly
conceived and vetted&#8221; by senior managers who were &#8220;in
transition&#8221; and not paying adequate attention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This portfolio morphed into something that, rather than
protect the firm, created new and potentially larger risks,&#8221;
Dimon said. &#8220;We have let a lot of people down, and we are sorry
for it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon said that the risk committee structures and processes
were not as robust in the CIO as they should have been. The
division&#8217;s London team built up a book of credit derivatives
that became so large that employees couldn&#8217;t unwind it without
roiling markets or incurring large losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;London &#8216;Cowboys&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to see consumer lenders in Columbus losing
their jobs because cowboys in London make too many risky bets,&#8221;
said Senator Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, referring to
19,000 JPMorgan employees in his state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon defended the bank by saying lawmakers needed to put
the losses &#8220;into perspective,&#8221; noting that no client, customer
or taxpayer money was impacted. He said the second quarter would
be &#8220;solidly profitable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of JPMorgan advanced 2.3 percent to $34.55 at 11
a.m. in New York, the most in the 24-company KBW Bank Index,
which climbed 0.7 percent. Shares of the bank have dropped 17
percent from May 10, when Dimon disclosed the losses, through
yesterday, lopping about $26.5 billion from the firm&#8217;s market
value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Capital Rules &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon explained that the bank instructed the CIO in
December to reduce its risk-weighted assets to prepare for new
international capital rules. Instead, the office in mid-January
&#8220;embarked on a complex strategy that entailed adding positions
that it believed would offset the existing ones,&#8221; Dimon said.
The portfolio grew and the problem got worse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley, the Oregon Democrat pushing for
stronger restrictions on banks&#8217; bets with their own money
through proprietary trading, said JPMorgan&#8217;s hedges were too
risky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Portfolio hedging is just a name for saying anything
goes, and we&#8217;ll continue proprietary trading,&#8221; Merkley said in
an interview on Bloomberg Television. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merkley, who co-wrote the Volcker provision in the Dodd-
Frank Act along with Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, has said
that the draft rule released by regulators in 2011 had loopholes
that would allow banks to maintain much of their proprietary
trading operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five U.S. agencies are working to complete the Volcker
rule, which is named for former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker and is
intended to reduce risky trading by banks with federally insured
deposits and access to the central bank&#8217;s discount window. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon said bank executives may have accidentally
misinformed its board and regulators on risks in its chief
investment office before the unit announced $2 billion in
trading losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To the extent that we were misinformed, we were
misinforming them,&#8221; Dimon 56, said at a hearing today of the
Senate Banking Committee in Washington. &#8220;It&#8217;s a little
unrealistic to expect the risk committee to capture something
like this.&#8221; He was referring to a three-member panel of the
board designated to monitor risk-management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of financial expertise on New York-based
JPMorgan&#8217;s risk committee has drawn criticism from shareholder
advocates. The three directors on the panel include a museum
head who sat on American International Group Inc. (AIG)&#8217;s governance
committee in 2008, the grandson of a billionaire and the CEO of
a company that makes flight controls and work boots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only member with any Wall Street experience, James Crown, hasn&#8217;t been employed in the industry for more than 25
years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEO Jamie Dimon was called to testify to the committee
after saying May 10 that the firm&#8217;s chief investment office
suffered a $2 billion loss trading credit derivatives. He later
called it &#8220;a Risk 101 mistake.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of the bank fell 24 percent through yesterday since
April 5, when Bloomberg News first reported that a trader in
JPMorgan&#8217;s chief investment office was taking such large
positions in credit-derivative indexes that he was distorting
prices in the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Federal Probes &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least half a dozen agencies, including the U.S.
Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange
Commission, are investigating the timing of the bank&#8217;s
disclosures about the losses and how risk-management systems
failed to prevent them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crown, 58, who is president of Chicago-based Henry Crown 
Co. and lead director of defense contractor General Dynamics
Corp. (GD), is on the risk committee with Ellen Futter and David Cote. Futter, 62, is president of the American Museum of Natural
History in New York, and Cote, 59, is CEO of Honeywell
International Inc. (HON) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futter&#8217;s re-election this year was opposed by Washington-
based investor group Change to Win and shareholder advocate
Glass Lewis  Co. over her previous experience on the boards of
AIG and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futter headed the audit committee of Bristol-Myers, a New
York-based drugmaker, during an accounting scandal that began in
1999 and that the company settled for $300 million to avoid
criminal prosecution. She also served on AIG&#8217;s compliance and
governance committees, resigning in July 2008 before the insurer
took a $182.3 billion bailout from the U.S. government. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lloyd C. Blankfein, chairman and
chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) for the past
six years, said it&#8217;s a &#8220;tough job to leave&#8221; and he&#8217;s unlikely
to follow his predecessors into government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When you think of my last five or six predecessors, five
of them left because they went to the government,&#8221; he told
reporters after participating in a discussion at the Chicago
Club. &#8220;I would say the government isn&#8217;t going to call me up. So
that means staying forever or dying at my desk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, 57, was named to his current job in June 2006 to
succeed Henry Paulson, who was nominated to serve as President
George W. Bush&#8217;s Treasury Secretary. During Blankfein&#8217;s tenure,
New York-based Goldman Sachs generated the highest profits in
its history and also the biggest losses since becoming a public
company in 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you why this is a tough job to leave,&#8221;
Blankfein said. &#8220;When things are going really well it&#8217;s the
best job in the world and you wouldn&#8217;t want to leave. And when
things are going badly you can&#8217;t leave because your sense of
responsibility won&#8217;t let you.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs converted to a bank in the aftermath of the
2008 financial crisis. The firm paid $550 million to settle a
Securities and Exchange Commission claim that it misled
investors in a 2007 mortgage-linked security, and the Senate&#8217;s
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations accused the company of
misleading investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Corzine, Rubin &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Paulson, leaders of the firm included Jon Corzine,
who became a U.S. senator and New Jersey governor; Stephen Friedman, who served as director of the National Economic
Council; Robert Rubin, Treasury secretary under President Bill
Clinton; John C. Whitehead, deputy secretary of state; and John L. Weinberg, who stepped down as senior partner and chairman in
1990 and died in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Blankfein said about when he&#8217;ll decide to
leave. &#8220;People who&#8217;ve done this don&#8217;t know their mood until
their mood switches.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gustave Levy, who preceded Weinberg and Whitehead, was
running the firm when he collapsed and died in 1976. Weinberg&#8217;s
father, Sidney Weinberg, remained involved in the firm until his
own death in 1969, according to Bill Cohan, author of &#8220;Money
and Power: How Goldman Sachs Came to Rule the World,&#8221; and a
Bloomberg View columnist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein made his comments at the Chicago Club, where he
participated in a discussion with Motorola Solutions Inc.
Chairman and CEO Greg Brown. Goldman Sachs is the fifth-largest
U.S. bank by assets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. (WMT), and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) are applying for Web suffixes
including .jpmorgan, .walmart, and .microsoft under a program to
expand the number of Internet domain names beyond .com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other proposals include .apple from Apple Inc. (AAPL) and .cialis
from Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY) as well as generic terms such as .book and
.love, according to a list published today by the Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, the nonprofit Web-
management group overseeing the expansion of suffixes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of 1,930 applications, which had been kept secret,
provides a first look at potential rivals to .com and the level
of company interest in the suffixes. Icann says the program may
result in hundreds more extensions to the right of the dot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is our fundamental obligation to increase competition
and consumer choice, and to foster innovation, and this program
delivers on that,&#8221; Icann Chief Executive Officer Rod Beckstrom
said at a news conference in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icann, which operates under a U.S. Commerce Department
contract, says the new domain names will give companies and
organizations new ways to structure their online operations and
market their brands and products to consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics including the Association of National Advertisers
say many companies that have no interest in domain names face
pressure to apply to prevent their branding from falling into
the wrong hands. Each application cost $185,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Objection Period &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two or more applicants are applying for 230 domain names,
according to Icann. Wal-Mart and Safeway Inc. (SWY) are competing for
the rights to .grocery. Such cases could be resolved by
auctions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icann, based in Marina del Rey, California, started
accepting applications in January. The process was interrupted
by a technical malfunction that prompted the group to close the
online application system for more than five weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icann will allow trademark owners and others to file
objections to the proposed domain names, and will begin
evaluating applicants next month based on technical and other
requirements, according to the group&#8217;s website. The first
approved domains may be ready early next year while others may
take longer, according to Icann. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fraud Concerns &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Trade Commission in December said a
proliferation of suffixes may create new opportunities for
online fraud. Icann should introduce the expansion as a pilot
program and reduce the number of domains created, the FTC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What Icann is doing seems to us to have very little
competitive benefit and a lot of cost to consumers in terms of
easier ways for malefactors to engage in fraud,&#8221; FTC Chairman
Jon Leibowitz said in a June 6 Bloomberg Government interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are currently 21 generic top-level domains led by
.com and 280 country-code domains such as .uk for the United
Kingdom. Icann has introduced generic suffixes such as .jobs and
.mobi in smaller rounds in previous years, with none of them
achieving registrations comparable with .com. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief
Financial Officer David A. Viniar expects that Moody&#8217;s Investors
Service&#8217;s pending downgrades of major U.S. banks will have a
&#8220;muted impact&#8221; on the companies, according to an analyst. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Kotowski at Oppenheimer  Co. in New York published a
research note describing a meeting he held yesterday with Viniar
and Stephen M. Scherr, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s head of financing and
Latin America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viniar, 56, said &#8220;the downgrades had been &#8216;totally
telegraphed&#8217; (i.e. priced in) and because it was the whole
industry would have a muted impact,&#8221; Kotowski wrote.
&#8220;Financial institutions are major issuers of debt,
institutional investors need to buy it and anyone who was not
aware of the downgrades was probably in the wrong business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and
Citigroup Inc. (C) are among companies that may be downgraded by two
levels, Moody&#8217;s said in a statement in February, adding that the
&#8220;guidance is indicative only.&#8221; Morgan Stanley (MS), Credit Suisse
Group AG (CSGN) and UBS AG (UBSN) could be lowered by as much as three
notches, Moody&#8217;s said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viniar and James Gorman, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s chief executive
officer, are among Wall Street executives who have publicly
questioned Moody&#8217;s analysis. Gorman said yesterday at an
investor conference in New York that a three-level cut of Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s rating would be &#8220;somewhat stunning&#8221; given the firm&#8217;s
increased capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Macro Hedges &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kotowski&#8217;s note said he also asked whether Goldman Sachs
uses &#8220;global macro hedges&#8221; to manage its risk. JPMorgan Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon is testifying today in the Senate
about his bank&#8217;s trading loss on derivatives that the firm has
described as designed to help offset, or hedge, the company&#8217;s
credit risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viniar&#8217;s response was that &#8220;essentially they don&#8217;t use
them,&#8221; Kotowski wrote. &#8220;Philosophically they believe that risk
management should be done in the business unit, not centralized.
The business needs to own the risk, and his role as CFO is to
set limits on it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) hired Duane Masucci, Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)&#8217;s head of distressed sourcing,
according to four people with knowledge of the move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Masucci, 45, will be a so-called sourcer at Goldman Sachs,
someone who locates and purchases distressed loans, bonds or
claims for a bank&#8217;s trading group and clients, said the people,
who declined to be identified because the hire hasn&#8217;t been
announced publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Masucci will probably start in New York in August, the
people said. He reports to Tom Tormey, Jerry Keefe and Dennis
Lafferty, co-heads of the distressed investing group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renee Calabro, a Deutsche Bank spokeswoman, Michael
DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, and Masucci, all declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, has
recently made changes to its credit-sales and trading business,
including limiting private information such as corporate
financial projections that is available to employees in loan
sales and trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the changes, earlier this year the bank named
Bryan Mix as global head of loan trading, and Jonathan Meltzer
and John Shaffer as co-heads of New York credit sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mix previously ran the Asia credit business, Meltzer was
previously head of bank loan sales in New York and Shaffer was
head of high-yield and distressed distribution groups, also in
New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leveraged loans, those rated below BBB- by Standard 
Poor&#8217;s and less than Baa3 at Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, are
usually private and investors in this debt can have access to
material non-public information that buyers of high-yield bonds
can&#8217;t. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe&#8217;s decision to provide Spain
with as much as 100 billion euros ($125 billion) to rescue its
banks has deepened the currency bloc&#8217;s crisis as it undermines
confidence in the government&#8217;s ability to finance itself,
JPMorgan Chase  Co. StrategistDaniel Morris said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When they went for the bailout, in some way you made it
worse,&#8221; Morris said in an interview in Stockholm today.
&#8220;Because if they couldn&#8217;t come up with the 100 billion euros
for the banks, where are they going to come up with the 300
billion euros that they need over the next few years for their
own funding?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Spain on June 9 became the fourth euro nation to seek
a bailout, its borrowing costs have soared. The country&#8217;s 10-
year bond yield reached a euro-area record yesterday of 6.834
percent, signaling investors doubt the rescue package will solve
Spain&#8217;s woes. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who as recently as
May 28 said he wouldn&#8217;t seek a bailout, described the deal as a
credit line for lenders with no fiscal austerity strings
attached. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spanish authorities have &#8220;put themselves in this position
where they almost have to bite the bullet and accept the
interest rates,&#8221; Morris said. &#8220;If they go for the full
bailout, you won&#8217;t have any more money left at that point and we
know Greece needs more money under even the best scenario, let
alone if Portugal or Ireland do as well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inflame Anxiety &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A full Spanish bailout would inflame anxiety over Italy&#8217;s
health, Morris said. Italy&#8217;s 10-year borrowing costs were little
changed today at 6.17 percent today, compared with 5.77 percent
before Spain announced its rescue deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fate of the euro ultimately hinges on the outcome of
Greek elections on June 17, as speculation mounts that a victory
for anti-austerity parties would trigger an exit from the
currency bloc, Morris said. He places the probability of such an
event at 25 percent to 33 percent, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s main scenario is that Greece will stay in the
euro and continue to &#8220;muddle through&#8221; the crisis, Morris said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Fundamentally, for all these countries in Europe, they
have to find ways to get the economies to grow faster and it
really does come back to structural reform,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There
is no way around it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset Managment&#8217;s Neil Gregson, manager of about $6.9 billion in natural-resource
assets, says mining companies should chase more takeovers as
rising costs force them to slow spending on expansions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These companies that are curtailing capex should be, I&#8217;m
sure they are, more active in making opportunities of the low
valuations,&#8221; London-based Gregson, who counts Xstrata Plc (XTA) and
Rio Tinto (RIO) Group among his top holdings, said in an interview in
London yesterday. &#8220;We&#8217;d certainly support a lot more MA.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) and Rio Tinto, the first and third-
biggest mining companies by sales, said last month they&#8217;ll
ration spending because of escalating costs and waning global
economic growth. The Bloomberg World Mining Index (BWMING) has lost 18
percent this year. First Quantum Minerals Ltd. (FQM), African Minerals
Ltd. (AMI) and London Mining Plc are likely acquisition targets,
Jefferies Group Inc. said June 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s fairly obvious there&#8217;s lots of supply issues on
copper and that copper will be a very attractive place to be
probably for the next 10 years or more,&#8221; said Gregson, a holder
of copper producers First Quantum and Freeport-McMoRan Copper 
Gold Inc. &#8220;There is room for more on the iron-ore side maybe
with some of these West African companies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;African Minerals, which has a market value of 1.2 billion
pounds ($1.9 billion), and London Mining both produce the steel-
making raw material in Sierra Leone. It declined 1 percent to
355.5 pence at 11:30 a.m. in London. First Quantum, a producer
of copper in Africa, has dropped 13 percent this year, valuing
it at C$8.3 billion ($8.1 billion). It was unchanged in London
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Projects &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve gone past the point where the capital expenditure
required to build new projects now far exceeds what you can go
out and buy,&#8221; Gregson said, adding he sees more deals. &#8220;That
is a trade-off where the companies should be much more active.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mining companies globally have announced $95 billion of
deals in the year to date, up from $75 billion in the same
period of 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Glencore International Plc (GLEN) agreed an all-share takeover of
Xstrata in February that values the shares of the target it
doesn&#8217;t already own at about 19.8 billion pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;MA activity in the sector should accelerate in 2013 as
capex budgets begin to decline and after the Glencore Xstrata
merger closes,&#8221; Jefferies analysts Christopher Lafemina and
Seth Rosenfeld said in a note. &#8220;We expect shares of inexpensive
miners that have significant low-cost growth potential and
miners that are possible MA targets to outperform.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Companies like Glencore, this is the perfect environment
for them,&#8221; Gregson said. &#8220;They are buyers and sellers and I
presume that they are very much in the buying mode.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A drop of as much as 50 percent in mining company
valuations since last year, while capital spending costs gained
as much as 25 percent has shifted the balance in favor of
acquisitions and mergers, Liberum Capital Ltd. analysts said in
a note. Spending on new output will drop 19 percent to $103.8
billion next year, according to a Bank of America Corp. report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon told Congress the bank let traders take
risks they didn&#8217;t understand while he didn&#8217;t answer key
questions about more than $2 billion in trading losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In testimony prepared for a hearing today, Dimon expressed
regret over losses in the bank&#8217;s chief investment office, saying
that its trading strategy was &#8220;poorly conceived and vetted&#8221; by
senior managers who were &#8220;in transition&#8221; and not paying
adequate attention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This portfolio morphed into something that, rather than
protect the firm, created new and potentially larger risks,&#8221;
Dimon said in the remarks ahead of his appearance today before
the Senate Banking Committee. &#8220;We have let a lot of people
down, and we are sorry for it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, 56, makes his first of two appearances on Capitol
Hill to face lawmakers probing how the largest and most
profitable U.S. bank, often praised for its &#8220;fortress&#8221; balance
sheet, could have taken such risks after coming through the 2008
financial crisis largely unscathed. His remarks left unanswered
what he knew when about the trading strategy and losses that
accelerated in March and April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We all bought into the idea that Jamie was the best
manager in the world,&#8221; said Paul Miller, a former examiner for
the Federal Reserve Board of Philadelphia and analyst at FBR
Capital Markets in Arlington, Virginia. &#8220;For a guy who is known
for risk management, he certainly didn&#8217;t put in place a top-tier
risk management system or board.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;VaR Switch &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon also didn&#8217;t address changes made earlier this year to
a company measurement known as value-at-risk, or VaR, that
underestimated the potential for losses. The switch -- and the
timing of the firm&#8217;s disclosures -- are the focus of an inquiry
by the Securities and Exchange Commission, agency chairman Mary Schapiro told the Senate panel on May 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other government investigations of New York-based JPMorgan
include a study of internal oversight by the Federal Reserve, a
probe of the trades by the Comptroller of the Currency, and
additional inquiries by the Department of Justice and the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon said that the risk committee structures and processes
were not as robust in the CIO as they should have been. The
division&#8217;s London team built up a book of credit derivatives
that became so large by that employees couldn&#8217;t unwind it
without roiling markets or incurring large losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Feels &#8216;Terrible&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon said he feels &#8220;terrible&#8221; that the firm will lose
shareholder money, yet defended the bank by saying lawmakers
needed to put the losses &#8220;into perspective,&#8221; noting that no
client, customer or taxpayer money was impacted. He said the
second quarter would be &#8220;solidly profitable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon explained that the bank instructed the CIO in
December to reduce its risk-weighted assets to prepare for new
international capital rules. Instead, the office in mid-January
&#8220;embarked on a complex strategy that entailed adding positions
that it believed would offset the existing ones,&#8221; Dimon said.
The portfolio grew and the problem got worse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[To read Dimon&#8217;s full testimony, click here.] &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of the bank have dropped 17 percent from May 10,
when Dimon disclosed the losses, through yesterday, lopping
about $26.5 billion from the firm&#8217;s market value. The furor cost
former Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew her job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Tim Johnson, the panel&#8217;s chairman, said in remarks
prepared for the hearing that he expected Dimon to answer how
the investment office, a unit designed to protect the company
from risk, could lose billions of dollars instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making Money &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;How can a bank take on &#8216;far too much risk&#8217; if the point
of the trades was to reduce risk in the first place?&#8221; the South
Dakota Democrat asked. &#8220;Or was the goal really to make money?
Should any hedge result in billions of dollars of net gains or
losses, or should it be focused solely on reducing a bank&#8217;s
risks?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, the top Republican on
the panel, will focus on the specific nature of the bank&#8217;s
trades, according to Jonathan Graffeo, his spokesman. The
senator also intends to ask whether management ignored warning
signs inside the CIO and whether Dimon supports higher capital
standards, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Volcker Rule &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, who&#8217;s set to face the House Financial Services
Committee on June 19, will also find himself in the middle of a
renewed debate about whether regulators should tighten curbs on
trading by deposit-taking banks after mortgage bets pushed the
financial system to the brink of collapse four years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, has used the
trading losses as ammunition in his fight to tighten exemptions
in the so-called Volcker rule. Merkley, who co-wrote the
provision in the Dodd-Frank Act along with Senator Carl Levin of
Michigan, has said that the draft rule released by regulators in
2011 had loopholes that would allow banks to maintain much of
their proprietary trading operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five U.S. agencies are working to complete the rule, which
is named for former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker and is intended to
reduce risky trading by banks with federally insured deposits
and access to the central bank&#8217;s discount window. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors and bankers, including Dimon, have speculated
that the loss may hurt their efforts to soften the Volcker rule
and other provisions of Dodd-Frank, which was passed to curb the
kinds of banking practices that contributed to the 2008
financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hard Distinction &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current draft of the Volcker rule permits banks to
continue trades for hedging but not for proprietary trading
designed to generate profits. Banks have said the distinction
can be hard to make. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s trading losses &#8220;could lead to a more stringent
interpretation of the Volcker rule,&#8221; Standard  Poor&#8217;s said in
a May 11 report. &#8220;That, in turn, could affect JPM&#8217;s hedging
strategies going forward by disallowing certain tactics, adding
risk to JPM&#8217;s portfolio.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s pay policies might offer some insight to
lawmakers, said Simon Johnson, a former chief economist at the
International Monetary Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What was the compensation arrangement for people in the
CIO, including traders and executives?&#8221; asked Johnson, who now
teaches at Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#8217;s Sloan School
of Management. &#8220;If they were paid based on firm-wide results,
they were hedging. If they were paid based on returns in CIO
itself, this is prop trading.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s biggest competitors, including Bank of America
Corp., Citigroup Inc. (C) and Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), have said their
corporate investment offices avoid the use of the kind of
derivatives that led to the trading losses and buy fewer bonds
exposed to credit risk. The rivals said their offices don&#8217;t
trade credit-default swaps on indexes linked to the health of
companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon&#8217;s apology is a first step in the company&#8217;s plan to
assuage concerns of investors, said David Hendler, an analyst at
CreditSights Inc. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not like you went through a stop sign and got a
slap-on-the-wrist ticket,&#8221; Hendler said. &#8220;It&#8217;ll have to be
every quarter for the next couple of years or so. That&#8217;s
basically job No. 1 for Jamie Dimon.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Pleasants, co-president of Walt
Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s interactive unit, expressed concern after passing
the crocodile exhibit at the company&#8217;s Animal Kingdom theme park
in Orlando last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney was developing an iPhone application starring a
toothy reptile named Swampy, and the crocs at the park didn&#8217;t
strike him as very endearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Are you sure it&#8217;s going to be cuddly?&#8221; Pleasants asked
his mobile-games chief, Bart Decrem, in a phone call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it,&#8221; Decrem recalled answering, saying
he was confident the character would be accessible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet has been a jungle for entertainment companies
and Disney, the world&#8217;s largest, is no exception. The Burbank,
California-based firm has lost $1.39 billion in the past five
years in its interactive media group, which develops games and
website content. Its continuing commitment to the business was
evident at the video-game industry&#8217;s E3 trade show in Los
Angeles last week, with a booth as big as heavyweights
Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI) and Electronic Arts Inc. (EA)&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger has
said the interactive unit will be profitable next year in part
because of a focus on games for social-networking sites such as
Facebook Inc. (FB)&#8217;s and for mobile devices. Both are capturing a
larger share of the $16.6 billion U.S. video-game market,
according to researcher NPD Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re targeting 2013 as a year of profitability. It&#8217;s
about time, because we&#8217;ve invested a fair amount,&#8221; Iger told
attendees at a conference sponsored by Sanford C. Bernstein 
Co. on May 30. &#8220;It&#8217;s a space that we should be in because the
brands, we think, can perform well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Not There&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the quarter ended March 31, the interactive unit lost
$70 million, smaller than the $115 million loss a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The division may lose $160 million in fiscal 2012,
estimates Todd Juenger, an analyst with Bernstein in New York.
While it may turn profitable at one point next year, he
estimates a loss of $25 million for all of 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They have been able to grow their revenues and shrink
their costs,&#8221; Juenger said in a telephone interview. &#8220;But
they&#8217;re still not there yet.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s Internet struggles began in the late 1990s, when
it acquired search engine Infoseek Corp. in transactions
totaling more than $1.5 billion. In 2001, the company recorded
$878 million in charges to close its Go.com web portal,
according to its annual report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outlays during the past five years include $350 million to
buy the children&#8217;s gaming site Club Penguin in 2007 and $563.2
million for social game-maker Playdom in 2010. Pleasants, who
ran Playdom, was named co-president of the interactive unit,
with former Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) executive James Pitaro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Media Follies &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s interactive experience mirrors that of media
industry rivals Viacom Inc. (VIA), which lost $316 million in 2010 on
Harmonix Music Systems, maker of the &#8220;Rock Band&#8221; video game,
and News Corp. (NWSA), which sold the social-networking site Myspace
last year for $545 million less than it paid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We made some obvious mistakes on the gaming side,
initially with a focus on the console space, and clearly the
whole gaming area has changed radically,&#8221; Iger told Bernstein
conference attendees. &#8220;Our goal now and our strategy is to
diversify our gaming efforts.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of mobile, social and other digital games represented
31 percent of the U.S. video game market last year, up from 20
percent in 2009, according to NPD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Marvel: Avengers Alliance,&#8221; a game the company launched
in March, has 9.3 million monthly users, placing it 16th among
Facebook games, according to Disney, which cited research from
AppData. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Console Retreat &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will limit its investment in console games to
&#8220;very Disney-branded, Marvel-branded&#8221; titles, according to
Iger. This year, the interactive unit will release six
traditional video-game titles, down from 21 in 2009, according
to the company and VGChartz.com, a research site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At E3, Disney announced a November release date for
&#8220;Disney Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two,&#8221; for Sony Corp. (6758),
Nintendo Co. and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) game platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two mobile titles titles also made their debuts at E3:
&#8220;Temple Run: Brave,&#8221; tied to this month&#8217;s Pixar film
&#8220;Brave,&#8221; and &#8220;Where&#8217;s My Perry?,&#8221; which features a character
from the Disney Channel cartoon &#8220;Phineas and Ferb.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mobile or a social game can be developed for $50,000 to
$5 million, according to Michael Pachter, a video game industry
analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. in Los Angeles. That compares
with $20 million for a multiple-console title, plus the added
cost of distributing discs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Design Costs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Where&#8217;s My Water?,&#8221; the Disney game featuring Swampy the
alligator, was designed in half a year by six developers for &#8220;a
couple of hundred thousand dollars,&#8221; Decrem said in a telephone
interview. A hit mobile game such as Rovio Entertainment&#8217;s
&#8220;Angry Birds&#8221; can generate $100 million in revenue, he said,
declining to release sales numbers for &#8220;Where&#8217;s My Water?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You can bring a complete experience to market at a
fraction of the cost,&#8221; Decrem said of mobile technology. &#8220;It&#8217;s
real money and it&#8217;s doubling every year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Where&#8217;s My Water?&#8221; was introduced last September and is
Disney&#8217;s biggest mobile hit so far. The game is sixth on the
list of top-selling paid iPhone applications at Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s
iTunes store and No. 4 for iPads. Players pay 99 cents to
download the game and can purchase additional levels of play for
$1.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &#8220;Where&#8217;s My Water&#8221; showing early success, Decrem
said he added more developers to the team, creating new chapters
and incentive for players to spend on the game. Disney also
threw resources behind the title, promoting it on the Disney
Channel cable network and on the Disney.com website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swampy now has a line of T-shirts and stuffed animals at
retailers such as Toys ``R'' Us Inc. (TOYS), and an animated Web 
series rolls out this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is one of Disney&#8217;s strengths,&#8221; Decrem said,
&#8220;taking an alligator and making it adorable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s chief
investment office engaged in trading strategies that set it
apart from other major U.S. banks, according to Thomas Curry,
head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OCC examiners probing JPMorgan&#8217;s $2 billion trading loss
have concluded that other big banks the agency regulates haven&#8217;t
followed similar practices with large, illiquid hedges, Curry
said in a letter to Senator Sherrod Brown dated June 12.
JPMorgan was more heavily involved in synthetic credit
derivatives than other banks, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This event deserves our attention, not just because it is
an unexpectedly large loss, but because of the broader questions
it raises regarding risk management and reporting within the
bank,&#8221; Curry said in the letter, responding to questions from
the Ohio Democrat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said on May 10
his company suffered losses after making trades on credit
derivatives that Bloomberg News first reported April 5. Trades
involving the so-called IG9 index were involved, according to
the OCC. The loss has spurred lawmakers and regulators to
investigate trading behavior and regulatory interactions at the
largest U.S. bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early April, the bank gave regulators information on the
positions that spurred meetings with bank management, Curry
said. The agency&#8217;s examiners told the bank to provide more
details on scope and risk, and they were evaluating the
positions and the bank&#8217;s strategy when the positions started a
steep decline, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon told senators at a hearing yesterday that the losses
came from &#8220;a complex series of trades&#8221; that wasn&#8217;t &#8220;just one
single thing.&#8221; He said that his company initially misinformed
regulators on specifics because its management misunderstood the
positions at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The second we found out, the first people we got on the
phone with was our regulators to explain &#8216;We have a problem, we
want to describe it to you&#8217;,&#8221; Dimon said in testimony. &#8220;And,
of course, they&#8217;ve been deeply engaged since then.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight OCC examiners at JPMorgan focused on capital markets
activities, according to the letter, with one specifically
watching the bank&#8217;s CIO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The CIO activities were not historically considered to be
high-risk,&#8221; Curry said, describing its $350 billion investment
portfolio as &#8220;high credit quality.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following companies had unusual
price changes in Mexico City trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the market close. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IPC index rose 0.8 percent to 37,440.48. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alsea SAB (ALSEA*) , Mexico&#8217;s largest fast-food chain
operator, climbed 7.1 percent to 16.40 pesos. The stock&#8217;s 14-day
relative strength index, a gauge of market momentum, was at 29.8
yesterday, the fourth day below 30. A reading of 30 or below is
a signal some investors use to indicate prices may be about to
rise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controladora Comercial Mexicana SAB (COMERUBC) , the
Mexican supermarket chain that defaulted on debt in 2008, jumped
12 percent to 27.06 pesos. The company said today that it&#8217;s
selling its stake in Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST)&#8217;s Mexico unit for
10.7 billion pesos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO) , the world&#8217;s largest
Spanish-language broadcaster, rose 2 percent to 56.15 pesos. The
company won conditional antitrust approval for the $1.6 billion
acquisition of a 50 percent stake in mobile-phone carrier Grupo
Iusacell SA, according to a statement today from the federal
antitrust commission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SAB, the world&#8217;s
largest Spanish-language broadcaster, climbed to the highest
price in a month after winning conditional antitrust approval
for the $1.6 billion acquisition of a 50 percent stake in
mobile-phone carrier Grupo Iusacell SA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa rose 2.1 percent to 56.18 pesos at 1:17 p.m. in
Mexico City after touching 56.22 pesos, the highest intraday
price since May 14. The Federal Competition Commission, which
reversed an earlier decision on appeal, said today that Televisa
could go through with the transaction if the broadcaster takes
steps to open itself up to more competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement ends a 14-month struggle by Mexico City-
based Televisa for the right to take on billionaire Carlos
Slim&#8217;s America Movil (AMXL) SAB in the mobile-phone business. Iusacell
has about 6 percent of Mexico&#8217;s wireless subscribers, compared
with America Movil&#8217;s 70 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The resolution is positive for Televisa,&#8221; said Valeria
Romo, an analyst at Monex Casa de Bolsa in Mexico City, today in
a research note. She recommends buying the shares. &#8220;It presents
the opportunity to enter the mobile market, which is valued at
$30 billion and showed growth in 2011 of 3.5 percent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa said it had agreed to several antitrust conditions
and is reviewing the verdict. An Iusacell spokesman had no
immediate comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Alliance Created &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal creates an alliance between Televisa and Ricardo Salinas, Iusacell&#8217;s billionaire owner, who also controls
broadcaster TV Azteca SAB. Televisa won approval of the Iusacell
investment by overcoming regulatory concern that it could lead
to collusion between the two broadcasters in the TV business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azteca was little changed at 8.48 pesos in Mexico City
trading. Iusacell is closely held. America Movil slid 0.7
percent to 16.81 pesos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new ruling overturns a vote in January in which the
antitrust agency cited possible collusion and the need to
protect Iusacell&#8217;s Totalplay pay-TV business, which competes
with Televisa&#8217;s Empresas Cablevision unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under terms of the antitrust settlement, the partnership
can be dissolved if the government fails to auction airwaves for
a third broadcast TV network in the next 24 months. That takes
away the incentive for Televisa and Azteca to slow the auction
process with legal challenges, the antitrust agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both broadcasters will also have to offer cable and
satellite TV providers the option to buy their over-the-air
channels separately from the cable channels both companies
produce. Televisa said it has created a package of its four
over-the-air channels to offer to carriers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Televisa&#8217;s Position &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iusacell will also transfer ownership of its Totalplay
unit, which sells TV, phone and Internet service to home users
in Mexico City, to a separate entity owned by Salinas, meaning
Televisa won&#8217;t own a stake in a competitor to its own cable-TV
carrier units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa has argued that the transaction would bring more
competition to the wireless industry by creating a stronger,
better-funded Iusacell, which sought a restructuring plan with
creditors in 2010 for the second time in four years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broadcaster announced the purchase of the stake in
April 2011. It spent the $1.6 billion last year, acquiring debt
that would be convertible into shares equal to 50 percent of
Iusacell once regulators approved the transaction. The debt has
an interest rate of 2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Slim&#8217;s company, Mexico City-based Iusacell
trails Madrid-based Telefonica SA (TEF) in total wireless subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interline Brands Inc. (IBI), a distributor
of janitorial, plumbing and lighting products that went public
in 2004, was sued by an investor contending its purchase by
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s private-equity unit and P2 Capital
Partners LLC undervalues the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interline board members are selling the company &#8220;by means
of an unfair process and for an unfair price,&#8221; Diane Cohen, the
investor, alleged in court papers made public today in Delaware
Chancery Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funds managed by GS Capital Partners and P2 Capital are to
pay Interline stockholders $25.50 a share. The proposed
transaction is valued at $1.1 billion including debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides selling too cheaply, the directors wrongfully
agreed to &#8220;certain onerous and preclusive deal protection
devices&#8221; that discourage other offers, according to Cohen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed deal contains a provision barring the company
from soliciting competing offers and forcing it to end any
negotiations with prospective suitors, the investor claims. The
funds also have a right to match any higher bids, according to
court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Access to Information &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The merger agreement gives the buyout group access to any
rival bidder&#8217;s information and allows the buyout group a free
right to top any superior offer simply by matching it,&#8221; lawyers
for Cohen wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interline would pay the buyout group a termination fee of
$29.9 million if the company decided to pursue the competing
offer, according to court papers. GS Capital Partners and P2
Capital Partners would receive a termination fee of
$13.9 million if Interline accepted a better proposal during the
so-called go-shop period, according to a May 29 regulatory
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal would mark Interline&#8217;s return to private hands
after eight years. Formed as Wilmar Industries in 1978, the
company went public in 1996 and was purchased four years later
by an investor group including Parthenon Capital LLC, Chase
Capital Partners, Chase Manhattan Bank and Sterling Investment
Partners LP in a cash deal valued at about $300.8 million. The
company raised $187.5 million in its public offering in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials of Interline couldn&#8217;t immediately be reached for
comment on the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interline rose 5 cents to $25.15 at 12:20 p.m. in New York
trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Cohen v. Grebe, CA7622, Delaware Chancery Court
(Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said the
Bank of England is likely to ease policy again in response to
the mounting euro-area crisis, changing its previous forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The probability of further easing in the U.K. has
increased markedly with the rapid escalation of the euro area
crisis,&#8221; economist Kevin Daly in London said in a note today.
&#8220;We expect the bank to supplement &#8216;conventional&#8217; QE with
specific actions to alleviate the funding conditions of U.K.
banks. The question of how much the bank eases by is
intrinsically linked to the question of how it eases.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the timing of any move, Daly said there &#8220;is a case for
waiting until the August Inflation Report, but we think a July
move is marginally more likely.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union is poised to
scrap most parts of a proposal that would force businesses to
rotate the credit-ratings company they hire to assess their
debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Parliament&#8217;s largest political groups agreed
to scale back the proposed rotation requirement so that it would
apply only to securitizations and other kinds of so-called
structured finance, said Jean-Paul Gauzes, a French member
helping to craft the legislation. The stance brings the
Parliament&#8217;s position largely into line with that of EU national
governments, which must also approve the new rules proposed by
the bloc&#8217;s regulators last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gauzes, who spoke with reporters yesterday in Strasbourg,
France, said, &#8220;We have a compromise that says we accept
rotation for structured products.&#8221; The assembly&#8217;s economic and
monetary affairs committee will vote on the draft law on June
19, according to the assembly&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission, the 27-nation EU&#8217;s regulatory arm,
proposed the obligatory rotation rule last year as part of a
draft law to toughen regulation of the ratings industry amid
concerns that some of their decisions exacerbated the euro-area
debt crisis. The commission said rotation would boost
competition and solve potential conflicts of interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the original proposal, companies would have been
obliged to change the company that they pay to rate their credit
every three years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special Section: JPMorgan Hearings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dimon Fires Back at &#8216;Complex&#8217; System in U.S. Senate Hearing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon
spent much of his time at a hearing where U.S. senators aimed to
put him on the defensive firing back at the federal regulatory
system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid chants from protesters, Dimon arrived shortly before
10 a.m. and began answering questions about the causes of the
loss. During more than two hours before the Senate Banking
Committee, Dimon described a $2 billion loss in the bank&#8217;s chief
investment office as a hedge that &#8220;morphed into something I
can&#8217;t justify,&#8221; and largely blamed subordinates for a trading
strategy gone wrong. The bank is looking at clawing back some of
the compensation earned by those responsible, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Dimon, one of the most vocal bankers in
challenging stricter regulation, said it would be hard for
federal agencies to decide on a final version of the so-called
Volcker rule, which bans proprietary trading for a bank&#8217;s own
account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon also said overconfidence in trusted managers allowed
traders to accumulate more than $2 billion in losses through a
strategy that &#8220;violated common sense.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk-monitoring systems and executives at the largest U.S.
bank failed to adequately police threats concentrated in a
derivatives portfolio at a London unit of the chief investment
office, he said. The division wasn&#8217;t subjected to the same
scrutiny as other businesses, and managers there deviated from
control procedures, even after triggers on risk limits were
breached, Dimon told the Senate Banking Committee yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the first of two appearances Dimon will make on
Capitol Hill to face lawmakers probing how the largest and most
profitable U.S. bank, often praised for its &#8220;fortress&#8221; balance
sheet, could have taken such risks after coming through the 2008
financial crisis largely unscathed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hearing didn&#8217;t answer some basic questions the Senate
has about the details of the New York-based bank&#8217;s loss,
according to Senator Richard Shelby, the ranking Republican on
the committee, said afterward. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trading Loss a Hit to Dimon&#8217;s Reputation, McDonald Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duff McDonald, author  of &#8220;Last Man Standing: The Ascent
of Jamie Dimon and JPMorgan Chase,&#8221; discussed the appearance of
Dimon yesterday before the Senate Banking Committee to answer
questions about a $2 billion trading loss at the bank&#8217;s chief
investment office. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Isaac Sees &#8216;Excessive Reliance&#8217; on Models in Regulation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Isaac, chairman of Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) and a former
chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., talked about
JPMorgan Chase  Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon&#8217;s
testimony before the Senate Banking Committee and U.S. financial
regulation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lawmakers Corker, Menendez React to Dimon Testimony &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon&#8217;s appearance before the Senate
Banking Committee marked the type of discussion lawmakers should
have had before the Dodd-Frank Act became law in 2010, Senator
Bob Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, told CNBC yesterday.
The hearing shows the &#8220;tremendous frailties&#8221; of the Dodd-Frank
regulatory law, the senator said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dodd-Frank Act was politically motivated and won&#8217;t
&#8220;stand the test of time,&#8221; Corker said. Lawmakers should work
on &#8220;real financial reform&#8221; that addresses markets, not just
institutions, and looks at issues such as &#8220;shadow&#8221; markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, U.S. Senator Robert Menendez, a Democrat from
New Jersey, talked to Bloomberg News about Dimon&#8217;s testimony on
the firm&#8217;s $2 billion trading loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Menendez spoke with Erik Schatzker in Washington on
Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;Money Moves.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Questions Remain After Dimon Testimony, Mayo Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike Mayo, an analyst at Credit Agricole Securities, talked
about yesterday&#8217;s testimony by Jamie Dimon, chief executive
officer of JPMorgan Chase  Co, before the Senate Banking
Committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayo spoke from New York with Rishaad Salamat on Bloomberg
Television&#8217;s &#8220;On the Move Asia.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ex-Morgan Banker Proposes Steps to Curb Japan Insider Acts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s ruling party will consider limiting the period for
public stock offerings to four days to curtail share declines
and discourage insider trading, said lawmaker and former Morgan
Stanley (MS) banker Tsutomu Okubo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okubo worked at Morgan Stanley for about 10 years until
entering parliament in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Democratic Party of Japan working group will discuss
truncating the period from the announcement of sales to
settlement of the deals from the current minimum 15 days, Okubo
said in an interview. The panel, which meets for the first time
tomorrow, was set up to examine ways to restore confidence in
markets rocked by trading and accounting scandals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese regulators are investigating short selling by
investors who used information leaked from underwriters
including Nomura Holdings Inc. before stock offerings were
announced. The benchmark Topix Index (TPX) has lost 16 percent since
the securities watchdog revealed the first case on March 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese law requires at least two weeks from the
announcement of equity offerings to the conclusion of the
transactions, in order to give investors time to decide whether
to participate. The period also gives shareholders ample time to
sell the stock on concern about dilution, Okubo, 51, said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the proposal, lead underwriters would begin marketing
equity offerings before they are announced, on the basis that
they and investors adhere to strict rules on confidentiality,
with punishments for breaches, said Okubo. That would bring
Japanese practice in line with markets including the U.S., he
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Nasdaq Exchange Immunity May Limit Losses From Facebook Claims &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nasdaq Stock Market (NDAQ) can rely on legal protections afforded
exchange operators to avoid paying damages to firms that lost
money on Facebook Inc. (FB), the former chief executive officer of
the American Stock Exchange said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second-largest equity venue&#8217;s status as a self-
regulatory organization means it will probably be spared
liability for technology breakdowns and bad decisions in the May
18 initial public offering, said Neal Wolkoff, a lawyer who also
ran ELX Futures LP. Nasdaq OMX Group Inc., the parent company,
proposed setting aside $40 million to compensate firms after
delayed orders and confirmations left brokers and fund managers
unsure of how many shares they owned in the $16 billion IPO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least one investor has sued Nasdaq and brokers Knight
Capital Group Inc. (KCG) and UBS AG (UBSN) said they are considering
lawsuits. Industry losses tied to delays and malfunctions that
slowed the confirmation of trades in the IPO may be close to
$200 million, Knight Chief Executive Officer Thomas Joyce said
June 7. CNBC said the total for UBS alone may be $350 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Madden, a spokesman for Nasdaq OMX, declined to
comment, as did Christiaan Brakman, a spokesman for UBS, and
Kara Fitzsimmons of Knight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owner of the largest social networking website was
scheduled to open at 11 a.m. New York time on May 18 when
trading was delayed by a design flaw in Nasdaq&#8217;s IPO auction
mechanism. Fixing it blocked order updates and cancellations
sent to the exchange over 19 minutes from being included in the
first public trade, or cross, at 11:30 a.m., and prevented
confirmations from being immediately distributed to brokers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;French Prosecutor Seeks to Increase Continental Fine, AFP Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continental Airlines Inc. should be convicted for
negligence and fined 225,000 euros ($283,050) in connection with
the Air France Concorde supersonic jet crash near Paris in 2000,
a French prosecutor recommended yesterday, Agence France-Presse
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prosecutor&#8217;s recommendation was to a court that is
hearing the airline&#8217;s appeal against its 2010 conviction, Agence
France-Presse said. The fine is heavier than the 200,000 euros
imposed by the lower court, though the prosecutor advised the
appeals court to clear the two Continental employees charged in
the affair, including the mechanic who received a suspended jail
sentence in the earlier verdict, AFP said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continental Airlines is now part of United Continental
Holdings Inc. (UAL) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deutsche Bahn Faces EU Antitrust Probe Over Rail Power Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bahn AG, Germany&#8217;s state-owned railway, faces a
European Union antitrust probe over the prices a unit charges
for power used by trains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission will investigate whether Deutsche
Bahn&#8217;s DB Energie unit, the only supplier of traction current in
Germany, offers discounts that &#8220;lead to higher prices for
competitors of Deutsche Bahn and place them at a competitive
disadvantage on the rail freight and passenger market,&#8221; the
regulator said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU regulators raided Deutsche Bahn&#8217;s offices last year to
check allegations that DB Energie was favoring the group&#8217;s rail-
freight arm over others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bahn &#8220;will work with the commission to clear up
the issue,&#8221; according to a spokesman who declined to be named,
citing company policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bahn last year filed a lawsuit at the EU&#8217;s Court
of Justice in Luxembourg over the EU raid that it said was an
unjustified &#8220;fishing expedition&#8221; by investigators seeking
evidence of antitrust infractions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU regulators can fine companies as much as 10 percent of
their yearly revenue for abusing a monopoly position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kerviel Tells Court He Only Sought to Make Money for SocGen &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerome Kerviel told a Paris appeals court yesterday that
his only goal was to make money for Societe Generale SA (GLE) and
reiterated his superiors knew he was taking positions that
exceeded his trading limits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former trader answered questions from the court as well
as lawyers for the bank and himself about the events of January
2008, when Societe Generale unwound his positions and announced
the resulting 4.9 billion-euro loss ($6.2 billion). He has said
previously that his actions were well-known and he never tried
to personally profit from the trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerviel was convicted in 2010, sentenced and ordered to pay
restitution in a verdict that held him solely responsible. He
said during hearings last week that the bank allowed him to
exceed his limits as a cover for unhedged positions the bank
took in the subprime mortgage market, where it foresaw losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philippe Hoube, a broker at Newedge Group, who wrote an
unsigned letter included with the documents, will testify today.
Hoube said Societe Generale filled Kerviel&#8217;s account with losing
operations before unwinding it to increase the loss it could
attribute to him, Liberation newspaper reported yesterday,
quoting the broker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luc Francois, one of the Kerviel&#8217;s former superiors and an
appeal witness, said the theory the bank knew of Kerviel&#8217;s
outsized trades and used him as a fall guy for subprime losses
was &#8220;a gigantic lie&#8221; and managers were in &#8220;complete shock&#8221;
when they learned of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Societe Generale said it will address Hoube&#8217;s &#8220;incorrect
analyses and the wrongful allegations&#8221; in a note to the court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tax Deal That Saved Goldman $31 Million to Get Court Review &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A deal between British authorities and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) that saved the bank as much as 20 million pounds ($31
million) in taxes will be reviewed by a U.K. court, a judge
ruled today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision came after anti-austerity group UK Uncut
questioned the legality of the decision by British taxing
authority Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue  Customs that allowed Goldman
to forego paying interest on money owed from a plan to avoid
contributions on employee bonuses dating from the 1990s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The British government has pledged to crack down on what it
sees as abusive tax-avoidance schemes, including a Barclays Plc
plan that denied the Treasury more than 500 million pounds.
Barclays Chief Executive Officer Robert Diamond criticized the
government&#8217;s handling of the dispute in May, calling it
&#8220;unwarranted.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judicial review is a legal mechanism that examines the
decision-making process of public bodies. UK Uncut had also
asked for the court review to consider overturning the Goldman
settlement, a request that was denied by Judge Peregrine Simon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon said the reexamination will focus on whether the
agreement was legal, and not on unraveling the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Goldman Sachs representative attended the court hearing.
Joanna Carss, a London-based Goldman Sachs spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to an e-mail requesting comment on the
ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Comings and Goings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.K. Antitrust Regulator Appoints Maxwell Chief Executive &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Office of Fair Trading appointed Clive Maxwell as its
new chief executive officer, the regulator said today in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maxwell, who has been on the OFT&#8217;s board since September
2010, replaces John Fingleton, who has been in the role for
seven years. The U.K. antitrust regulator said Maxwell will be
paid 135,500 pounds ($209,000) a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. government announced in March that it planned
beginning in April 2014 to bring together the antitrust
functions of the OFT and the Competition Commission to create
the Competition Markets Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nigeria&#8217;s SEC Head Oteh Sent on Compulsory Leave by Board &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arunma Oteh, director-general of Nigeria&#8217;s Securities and
Exchange Commission, was sent on &#8220;compulsory leave&#8221; to enable
an independent investigation of allegations of mismanagement,
the market regulator said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision followed an audit of spending on celebrations
of the 50th anniversary of the capital market, Edosa Kennedy
Aigbekaen, the secretary to the commission, said yesterday in an
e-mailed statement. It was recommended to the board &#8220;that the
key actors in the management of the funds should be asked to
step aside to allow an unhindered investigation,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daisy Ekineh, SEC&#8217;s executive commissioner for operations,
will temporarily act as director-general, according to the
statement. Oteh didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mailed
request for comment. An official who answered a call to the
agency said Oteh had made representations to the appropriate
authorities and wasn&#8217;t available for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)&#8217;s North American chief,
Chris Weber, was named head of sales in Chief Executive Officer
Stephen Elop&#8217;s biggest management overhaul, taking on the task
of winning buyers for the new flagship Lumia phone line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weber, who like Elop is a Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) veteran, will
take over responsibilities now held by Jerri DeVard and Niklas Savander, who are both stepping down, the Espoo, Finland-based
company said in a statement today. Timo Toikkanen will succeed
Mary McDowell as head of the mobile-phone division, which makes
low-end handsets mainly for emerging markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They needed to change management,&#8221; said Helena Nordman- Knutson, an analyst at Pareto Securities in Stockholm. &#8220;It was
overdue.&#8221; The CEO &#8220;is not a management consultant, and he
couldn&#8217;t make decisions on management in the first months
because the focus was on operating systems. Now he has had time
to evaluate the people.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elop, who became CEO in 2010, is betting on smartphones
using a version of Microsoft&#8217;s Windows technology to rebuild
market share after losing ground to Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPhone and
devices operating on Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Android platform. The
turnaround hasn&#8217;t stopped losses yet and Nokia, which is trying
to conserve cash, outlined plans today to cut as many as 10,000
jobs and shutter sites in Finland, Germany and Canada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;American Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North America under Weber was the sole region where Nokia
increased handset shipments sequentially in the first quarter,
helped by the release of the Lumia 710 through Deutsche Telekom
AG (DTE)&#8217;s T-Mobile division in January. Shipments in the quarter, in
advance of the release of the Lumia 900 phone, were still down
50 percent from a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weber &#8220;has made tremendous strides in kick-starting our
re-entry into the U.S., and his track record of driving results
will serve Nokia well,&#8221; Elop said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview a week ago, Weber, who was born in 1965,
said Nokia needs to show wireless operators why the Lumia stands
out against the competition if it wants to expand deals with
carriers and sell more devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toikkanen, born in 1966, was previously head of business
development. He has worked for Nokia in the greater China area
and Singapore. Weber, Toikkanen and Juha Putkiranta, who was
appointed executive vice president of operations, will join
Nokia&#8217;s executive board, now called the leadership team, as of
July 1, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia has lost more than 70 billion euros ($88 billion) in
market value since Cupertino, California-based Apple introduced
the iPhone in 2007, taking the lead in smartphone innovation.
Nokia&#8217;s operating margin for mobile phones plunged to 3.7
percent of revenue last year from more than 20 percent before
the iPhone went on sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Finnish company now predicts second-quarter operating
margins at the devices unit will be worse than a loss of 3
percent of revenue in the first quarter, Nokia said today. The
phonemaker had projected margins would be &#8220;similar to or
below&#8221; the first-quarter figure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) was sued by a
Louisiana police pension fund for alleged securities fraud tied
to a trading loss of at least $2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement System
claimed the biggest U.S. bank and top officials including Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon misled investors about its risk
management and financial condition from February 2010 to May
2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Defendants made false and misleading statements and
concealed material information relating to the company&#8217;s trading
practices, hedging of risk, risk management, and exposure to
risk of loss,&#8221; according to the complaint filed today in U.S.
District Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The police pension plan is seeking class-action, or group,
status on behalf of all who bought JPMorgan Chase common stock
from February 2010 to May 2012, a number which may be in the
tens of thousands, according to the complaint. It is also
seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for the New York-based
bank, declined to comment on the allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, Dimon announced the lender lost $2 billion as a
result of &#8220;egregious mistakes&#8221; by its Chief Investment Office.
Ina Drew, who led that office, retired after Dimon&#8217;s
announcement and was replaced by Matt James. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement
System v. JPMorgan Chase  Co., 12-cv-4729, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eileen Rominger, the former Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) executive who joined the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission last year, will step down next month as head
of the agency&#8217;s investment management unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rominger, 57, is retiring from the SEC in July after nearly
18 months heading the unit in charge of developing tougher rules
for money market funds, according to a statement released by the
agency today. SEC commissioners are divided on whether and how
to further regulate money funds and have been unable to reach
consensus on putting a proposal out for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Eileen understood the importance of a fair and efficient
investment management industry to the well-being of investors
everywhere,&#8221; SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro said in the agency&#8217;s

&lt;p&gt;Rominger, who previously served as global chief investment
officer for Goldman Sachs Asset Management, joined the SEC in

&lt;p&gt;When Hal Dvorak, a Harvard scientist
whose ideas helped spur the advance of targeted cancer drugs,
sought a partner recently to help him develop new treatments, he
only had to walk two blocks to find one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), which is spending $100 million to open a
state-of-the-art laboratory in Boston, was there. For Dvorak,
teaming with Pfizer &#8220;is an ideal arrangement,&#8221; he said,
providing convenience and expertise bringing research into the
clinic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partnerships between industry and academia, of course,
aren&#8217;t new. Yet Pfizer, Sanofi, Merck  Co. (MRK) and other drug
companies are putting a new twist on the arrangement by stepping
up their level of collaboration with universities. In the case
of Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drug company is embedding
operations in Boston, San Francisco, New York and San Diego,
often in the very same buildings where famed academic
institutions have labs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No matter how much money you have, nothing compares to
the innovation going on out in the world,&#8221; said Jose Carlos Gutierrez-Ramos, the director of the Pfizer lab, in an
interview. &#8220;We want to be here, integrated into this fabric.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The push represents Pfizer&#8217;s strategy for long-term drug
development at a time of uncertain prospects for new
blockbusters. Pfizer gained its two biggest sellers, the
cholesterol pill Lipitor and the painkiller Lyrica, in its $120
billion purchase of Warner-Lambert in 2000. As opportunities for
such mega-deals become more scarce in the pharmaceutical
industry, the need for long-range planning will become
increasingly important. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Future Promise &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s why Pfizer sees embedding in academic labs so
crucial to its future. The ideas that show promise, &#8220;we&#8217;ll buy
later,&#8221; said Gutierrez-Ramos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In two to three years, Pfizer plans to have 50 drug
development projects running in their centers around the
country, all of which have been opened since late 2010,
Gutierrez-Ramos said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initiative comes at a crucial point in the company&#8217;s
history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipitor, once the world&#8217;s best-selling drug with more than
$12 billion a year in sales, stands to lose 80 percent of its
revenue as cheaper generic versions grab market share this year.
The company has also suffered a series of research failures
since 2006, when a drug designed to replace that revenue, the
good-cholesterol pill torcetrapib, was abandoned after being
linked to heart attacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Read&#8217;s Strategy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, Chief Executive Officer Ian Read has begun
cutting back the size of the company, selling one non-
pharmaceutical unit, planning to spin off another and trimming
expenses. He has said he wants to rebuild Pfizer into a smaller,
faster-moving company that focuses on development of new drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It makes sense to outsource anything that someone else
can do better than you and that you don&#8217;t consider a core
competency or source of competitive advantage,&#8221; Erik Gordon, a
professor of business at the University of Michigan in Ann
Arbor, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer gained less than 1 percent to $22.61 at the close in
New York. Since Dec. 3, 2010, the last trading day before Read
was named CEO, the stock has increased 35 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Strong Connections &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is turning to executives like Gutierrez-Ramos, whose
job is to create strong connections within one of the world&#8217;s
most creative hotbeds for biotechnology innovation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Boston, the Pfizer lab is located in the same building
as offices of renowned research centers of Boston Children&#8217;s
Hospital and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, which would
make some potential partnerships just an elevator ride away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Boston lab has reviewed 400 partnership proposals in
the last year and is working on projects involving chronic
kidney disease, osteoporosis and cancer, Tony Coyle, chief
scientific officer for the Pfizer center, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gutierrez-Ramos said he is trying to create an atmosphere
at the lab where outside researchers easily come and go, and
Pfizer&#8217;s scientists visit neighboring academicians on their
turf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pharmaceutical companies, which historically are highly
secretive about their work because of competition, need to be
willing to take more risks in the future, he said, creating
access to its inner sanctums to develop drugs earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Development Resources &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Pfizer offers academic researchers are
&#8220;extraordinary&#8221; resources for drug development that nearby
university labs can&#8217;t match, said Harvard&#8217;s Dvorak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dvorak, in 1983, was one of the first scientists to
demonstrate that cancer cells secreted vascular endothelial
growth factor, or VEGF, the initial idea behind development of
drugs, such as Roche Holding AG (ROG)&#8217;s Avastin, that cut off the
blood supply to tumors to stop their spread. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;An academic lab can only go so far,&#8221; Dvorak said in a
telephone interview from Boston. &#8220;We&#8217;re good at identifying
targets, but if you want to make monoclonal antibodies or take
this to the clinic, we have no experience in that. That&#8217;s not
our bag.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coyle, of Pfizer&#8217;s center, agrees. &#8220;We&#8217;ve cured diabetes
in mice so many times&#8221; in the laboratory, Coyle said. &#8220;But
there&#8217;s been a very poor appreciation from the academic
community&#8221; about how to develop drugs for use in the clinic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;18th Floor &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of the advantages for academics can be seen in a
single machine located on the lab&#8217;s 18th floor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separated by a wall of glass from an open-plan suite for
the group&#8217;s top managers, the machine has the ability to rapidly
test thousands of compounds against Pfizer&#8217;s own chemical
library to see if they match with known disease pathways or
proteins that have been identified as possible targets. Past
rows of lab benches, two rooms full of complex imaging equipment
are used to identify how proteins interact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Universities and research institutes need all the help they
can get, according to a report by the Tufts Center for the Study
of Drug Development released in April. Funding from the U.S.
National Institutes of Health has been unchanged for a decade,
at about $31 billion for 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, pharmaceutical companies have cut their
early-stage research budgets in a tough economy to focus on
late-stage clinical development and marketing, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Significant Change &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partnership model now being pursued by Pfizer and a few
other large drugmakers, &#8220;represents the most significant change
in the innovative landscape we&#8217;ve seen in three decades,&#8221; said
Ken Kaitin, director of the Tufts center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanofi (SAN), based in Paris, has its own collaboration program,
with Harvard, the University of California, San Francisco, and
several others, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, Merck, the second-biggest U.S. drugmaker,
announced it was joining the party. The Whitehouse Station, New
Jersey-based company said it will spend as much as $90 million
over seven years to help fund a new California Institute for
Biomedical Research it will run in San Diego. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With academic centers, with the reduction in NIH support,
there&#8217;s almost a desperation that they must, must find new
revenue streams,&#8221; Kaitin said in an interview in Boston.
&#8220;That, in most cases, means working with industry.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will announce plans
to sell a tablet running the next version of the Windows
operating system under its own brand, a major departure from its
strategy of partnering with computer makers, according to a
person familiar with the plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based company may demonstrate the
device at an event in Los Angeles on June 18, said the person,
who asked not to be identified because the plans haven&#8217;t been
made public. The company has said it aims to release the new
Windows 8 operating system in time for the holiday season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been working with personal-computer makers to
produce Windows 8 tablets, designed to win back consumers who
have shunned Windows machines in favor of Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPad. The
world&#8217;s largest software maker may be taking steps to exert more
control over the hardware that runs its programs -- as Apple
does -- in order to mount a more successful challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If Microsoft wants to control the entire user experience
and the entire quality of their products, they have to build
their own hardware,&#8221; said Michael Cherry, an analyst at
Directions on Microsoft, a Kirkland, Washington-based market-
research firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frank Shaw, a spokesman for Microsoft, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the company invited press via e-mail to an event
in Los Angeles on June 18 at 3:30 p.m., at a location to be
disclosed later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This will be a major Microsoft announcement -- you will
not want to miss it,&#8221; the invitation said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Software Focus &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares rose 2.3 percent to $30.02 at the close in
New York. The stock has gained 16 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the release of International Business Machines
Corp.&#8217;s first PC in 1981, Microsoft has focused on software for
the machines and left design and branding to hardware makers.
While the company has in the past decade played a larger role in
working with some PC makers on design, it has shied away from
developing the machines and selling them under the Microsoft
brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shift in strategy has the potential to sour Microsoft&#8217;s
relationship with some PC partners, many of which have been
investing to develop Windows 8 tablets themselves and may not
want to compete directly with Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, PC makers may have limited recourse, said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners LP in New York. Apple doesn&#8217;t
license its software to computer makers, and Google Inc. (GOOG), which
makes the Android operating system, will probably make its own
tablets through its recent acquisition of Motorola Mobility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tablet Options &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you&#8217;re a computer maker, you don&#8217;t love it,&#8221; Gillis
said. &#8220;But what are you going to do? Build an Android tablet?
Google is going to build its own tablet, too. Everyone is making
their own hardware now. It&#8217;s like having a poodle in your purse.
All the cool kids are doing it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The addition of a tablet would radically alter
profitability in the Windows business, which now sells just
software with operating margins of more than 60 percent. By
comparison, computer maker Dell Inc. (DELL)&#8217;s operating margin for the
most recent fiscal year was about 7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A move into tablets would be a similar strategy to the one
Microsoft employed with its Zune music and video player.
Microsoft initially provided software to partners, who failed to
gain share against Apple&#8217;s iPod, forcing Microsoft to produce
its own hardware. The Zune failed to dent Apple&#8217;s dominant
market share, and Microsoft canceled the product last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Controlled Experience &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Microsoft, sticking with devices from its PC partners
only may be equally risky. Sales in the Windows group have
missed analysts&#8217; estimates in four of the six most recent
quarters as consumers shifted to purchasing tablets rather than
lower-cost laptop PCs running Windows. Microsoft, which
initially released a version of Windows for tablet machines in
2002 before scaling back, has zero share of the market now,
according to researcher Gartner Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selling a branded tablet would help the company make sure
the new Windows dovetails exactly with the hardware, avoiding
issues that have cropped up when computer makers have added
their own software that has degraded or limited the performance
or design of Windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The idea would be to make sure Microsoft&#8217;s vision for
such a device is translated exactly into the consumer experience
without a third-party interpretation,&#8221; said Michael Gartenberg,
an analyst at Gartner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apple&#8217;s Dominance &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple has expanded its grip on the tablet market even as
companies such as Amazon.com Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co.
release new tablets running Google&#8217;s Android software and PC
makers work to prepare their Windows 8 tablets. Researcher IDC
yesterday boosted its forecast for the tablet market on strong
demand for the iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide shipments of tablets this year will be 107.4
million units, up from an earlier projection of 106.1 million,
Framingham, Massachusetts-based IDC said in a statement. Unit
sales may reach 142.8 million next year and 222.1 million by
2016, the researcher said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IDC predicts the iPad will account for 62.5 percent of
global shipments this year, up from 58.2 percent last year.
Apple&#8217;s share could rise even further if it introduces a smaller,
less expensive tablet, IDC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s tablet plans were previously reported by
entertainment website The Wrap and the All Things D blog. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s merchant
bank, which has raised about $120 billion in funds ranging from
private equity and debt to infrastructure, said today that three
of its most senior employees are leaving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muneer Satter, who built the world&#8217;s largest family of
mezzanine funds; Hughes Lepic, who ran the merchant-banking
division in Europe; and Gerald J. Cardinale, co-head of Americas
private-equity funds, have decided to retire, according to three
separate memos from Richard A. Friedman, who leads the merchant-
banking division. They have worked at New York-based Goldman
Sachs for 24, 22 and 20 years, respectively, the memos show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loss of the three partners -- the highest rank of
employee at Goldman Sachs -- comes as the fifth-biggest U.S.
bank by assets prepares for new regulations that will cap banks&#8217;
investments in such funds to 3 percent. Goldman Sachs had stakes
worth $8.83 billion in private-equity funds, $3.74 billion in
private-debt funds and $1.54 billion in real estate funds at the
end of March, according to a quarterly filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would stay at Goldman Sachs forever if I could,&#8221;
Satter, 50, said in a press release today about his decision to
leave after 12 years of commuting to New York from his home in
Chicago. &#8220;Starting in July, I look forward to spending each day
and evening with my wife and five children.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Private Equity &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs lost about 50 partners last year as the
company cut pay awards in its worst year for profit since 2008.
The company, which was a partnership before going public in
1999, continues to reward a select group of employees with the
title of &#8220;partner&#8221; and a special pool of compensation. New
partners are appointed every even-numbered year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lepic, 47, who is retiring at the end of August, joined
Goldman Sachs in 1990 to work in mergers and acquisitions in New
York and moved to London in 1991. He has worked in the Principal
Investment Area, which manages the bank&#8217;s own investments and is
known as PIA, since 1996 and has held his current role since
2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lepic, a French citizen, helped establish Goldman Sachs
&#8220;as one of the leading principal investors in Europe in private
equity, credit and infrastructure,&#8221; according to the memo.
&#8220;During his tenure PIA invested over $7 billion in private-
equity transactions in Europe.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;YES Network &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cardinale, 45, who is staying until the end of the year,
joined the firm&#8217;s corporate finance division in New York in 1992
before working in investment banking in Hong Kong and PIA in
Singapore. In 1997 he returned to New York to work as an
investment banker to telecommunications, media and technology
companies before returning to PIA in 1999. He has been a partner
since 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cardinale, known as Gerry, was responsible for more than $6
billion in investments, including the firm&#8217;s holding in Yankees
Entertainments  Sports Network, which was founded in 2001 to
broadcast the games of the New York Yankees baseball team and
the New Jersey Nets basketball team. Yankees third-baseman Alex Rodriguez worked with Cardinale and John Mallory in 2007 to help
him negotiate a new contract, people familiar with the matter
said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Goldman Sachs doesn&#8217;t break out the merchant bank&#8217;s
revenue or profit, gains on its holdings are included in a
segment called &#8220;Investing  Lending&#8221; in the company&#8217;s
quarterly reports. That business generated about 7 percent of
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s net revenue in 2011, 19 percent in 2010 and 6
percent in 2009, according to company reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fed Meeting &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Over the period from 1999 through the first quarter of
2012, the firm&#8217;s aggregate net revenues from its investments in
hedge funds and private-equity funds were not material to the
firm&#8217;s aggregate total net revenues over the same period,&#8221;
according to a Goldman Sachs&#8217;s regulatory filing for the quarter
ended in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a meeting with Federal Reserve Board staff in February,
Goldman Sachs executives argued that &#8220;credit funds&#8221; should be
exempted from the 3 percent investment cap, according to a
meeting summary published in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henry Cornell, 56, who has worked in the merchant-banking
division since 1992 and became a partner in 1994, was named vice
chairman of the division, according to a separate memo. Tom Connolly, who has served with Satter as co-head of the
corporate-credit business that oversees loan and mezzanine
funds, will become sole head of that unit. Andrew Wolff will
move to London from Hong Kong to lead the division in Europe,
while remaining co-head of the business in Asia with Ankur Sahu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deep Bench &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are confident that these changes position us strongly
for future success,&#8221; Friedman wrote in the memo. &#8220;They also
demonstrate our deep leadership bench as we elevate a new set of
leaders and create opportunities for other MBD professionals.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman for the bank, confirmed the
memos&#8217; contents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephanie Hui, who has worked in the merchant-banking
division for more than 12 years, will run the Asia business
excluding Japan from Hong Kong and will report to Wolff,
according to the memo. Hui was promoted to partner in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adrian M. Jones, a partner since 2004, and Sanjeev Mehra, a
partner since 1998, will run the private-equity business in the
Americas, while San Francisco-based Joseph P. DiSabato, who has
been a partner since 2004, will remain head of GS Growth,
according to the memo. Sumit Rajpal, a partner since 2010, will
lead the global financial institutions business and Kenneth A. Pontarelli, a partner since 2006, will continue to oversee the
global energy and natural resources business, according to the
memo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) agreed to start
drilling tight oil prospects in Siberia in 2013 with state-run
OAO Rosneft as Russia looks to tap the technology that reversed
slumping U.S. output. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon will finance geological studies and drilling at the
Bazhenov and Achimov shale formations, the companies said today
in a statement. After the exploration stage, the Irving, Texas-
based producer will get a 33.3 percent stake in any development,
they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Vladimir Putin, who oversaw today&#8217;s agreement and
an earlier accord in April, is inviting foreign producers to
help reverse declines in the mature West Siberia oil province
and keep output at a post-Soviet high of more than 10 million
barrels a day. Crude and gas provided half of the government&#8217;s
budget revenue last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We didn&#8217;t choose this partner by chance,&#8221; Rosneft Chief
Executive Officer Igor Sechin said today, highlighting the U.S.
unconventional oil and shale gas boom. He spoke at a signing
ceremony attended by Putin and his Exxon counterpart Rex
Tillerson in Tuapse on Russia&#8217;s Black Sea coast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies will seek to pump a mixture of chemicals and
sand into horizontal wells to smash the low permeability rock
that characterizes the Bazhenov geology and thus increase the
amount of oil flowing up wells. Such output from the Bakken
shale in North Dakota has pushed an U.S. oil boom that since
2009 has begun to reverse almost two decades of decline,
according to BP Plc (BP/) data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;International Partnership &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s tight oil agreement firms up part of the wide-
ranging partnership signed in April in which Exxon has pledged
to spend $3.2 billion to study and drill for some of the world&#8217;s
largest resources in difficult, unexplored provinces in Russia&#8217;s
deepwater Black Sea and the Arctic Kara Sea. Rosneft, meanwhile,
has signed agreements to gain stakes in Exxon projects in Texas,
Canada and the Gulf of Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia is developing tax incentives by October to encourage
development of unconventional oil deposits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pilot wells will seek to locate deposits that Rosneft
has said may hold 13.2 billion barrels of oil, a prospect needed
for Russia to keep supplying 16 percent of global exports
another decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are not only looking at new geographical regions of
operation, but are also studying the potential of difficult to
produce reserves in traditional oil producing regions,&#8221; Sechin
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Muneer Satter, who built the world&#8217;s
largest family of mezzanine funds at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS),
is leaving the bank after 24 years, according to two people
familiar with his plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satter, 50, is departing to spend more time with his family
after commuting for the past 12 years from his home in Chicago
to Goldman Sachs&#8217;s headquarters in New York, the people said,
asking not to be named because his move hasn&#8217;t been announced
publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satter, who serves as one of the co-chairs for U.S.
presidential candidate Mitt Romney&#8217;s national finance committee,
became a partner at Goldman Sachs in 1996 and oversees a team of
about 20 people who work in the firm&#8217;s merchant bank. The
business has raised more than $28 billion since its inception 16
years ago and is the biggest in the world, according to the
company&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m surprised he lasted as many years as he did commuting
from Chicago,&#8221; said Gordon Crawford, the fund manager at
Capital Group Cos. in Los Angeles whose views help shape media
industry deals. &#8220;He&#8217;s been offered other gigs in New York but
that&#8217;s not going to happen.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satter didn&#8217;t return a call seeking comment about his
departure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mezzanine funds make loans to companies at higher rates
than banks and buy their preferred stock. They profit from
interest payments and the eventual sale of the equity interest.
The financing technique is often used in takeovers, and can take
the place of high-yield, high-risk debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Merchant Bank &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s merchant bank, which has raised about $120
billion in funds ranging from private equity and debt to
infrastructure, named Satter as both chairman of its risk
committee and a member of the investment committee. Satter&#8217;s
group started with $1.2 billion and created its largest fund, of
$13 billion, in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Goldman Sachs doesn&#8217;t break out the merchant bank&#8217;s
revenue or profit, gains on its holdings are included in a
segment called &#8220;Investing  Lending&#8221; in the company&#8217;s
quarterly reports. That business generated about 7 percent of
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s net revenue in 2011, 19 percent in 2010 and 6
percent in 2009, according to company reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s mezzanine funds could become subject to the
Volcker rule, which limits depository institutions from
supplying more than 3 percent of the capital in a hedge fund,
private-equity fund or other &#8220;covered fund.&#8221; Goldman Sachs has
been asking regulators to loosen the proposed limits on bank
investments in such pools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Alliance Boots &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satter&#8217;s deals include helping to finance the 11.1 billion-
pound ($17.2 billion) leveraged buyout of Alliance Boots Plc,
the largest U.K. drugstore chain, and Blackstone Group LP&#8217;s
takeover of Anheuser-Busch InBev NV&#8217;s amusement-park business
for $2.3 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Muneer got to the point pretty quickly and, as a client,
you didn&#8217;t try bullying terms out of him,&#8221; Christopher Stadler,
managing partner at CVC Capital Partners Ltd., said in an
interview. &#8220;He responded to the strength of the relationship.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of helping to finance LBOs, Satter&#8217;s unit
worked closely with the investment bank&#8217;s financial-sponsors
group, which was previously co-led globally by Milton Berlinski.
Berlinski left the bank after 25 years in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satter contributed $95,000 to the super-PAC backing Romney,
Open Secrets data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He has been a leader and adviser to me and my campaign,
for which I&#8217;m grateful,&#8221; Romney said through a spokesman.
&#8220;Even more importantly, I consider him a dear friend.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rahm Emanuel &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the local level, he has contributed to Chicago mayor
Rahm Emanuel, Open Secrets data show. He sits on the board of
World Business Chicago, the city&#8217;s not-for-profit economic-
development corporation whose chairman is Emanuel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is also chairman of the finance committee at the Nature
Conservancy, a nonprofit that promotes diversity among the
world&#8217;s plant and animal species, according to the
organization&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have followed his career and his success is no
surprise,&#8221; said Sam Zell, chairman of Equity Group Investments
LLC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO) plans to return to
Myanmar for the first time in more than 60 years, leaving Cuba
and North Korea as the only nations where the maker of the
world&#8217;s most popular soft drink doesn't do business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will start operating in Myanmar as soon as the
U.S. government issues a license allowing investments in the
Southeast Asian country, a move that may be &#8220;imminent,&#8221; the
Atlanta-based company said in a statement distributed by
Businesswire yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myanmar is enhancing economic, military and political ties
with Western nations after years of isolation that left its 64
million people among Asia&#8217;s poorest. The country&#8217;s transition to
democracy in recent months after about five decades of military
rule prompted the U.S. to ease sanctions in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Coca-Cola&#8217;s planned entry into Myanmar, following the
suspension of sanctions, will be governed by its well-
established global standards for corporate ethics including
strict adherence to its global human and workplace rights
policy, supplier guiding principles, code of business conduct,
and anti-bribery policies,&#8221; the company said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola will initially import some products from
neighboring countries before &#8220;making significant investments in
Myanmar over the next three-five years,&#8221; the company said,
adding it will work with local partners to support the country&#8217;s
long-term economic development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cuba, North Korea &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola has grown from selling nine drinks a day in a
single country in 1886 to distributing 1.8 billion beverages in
more than 200 nations, according to data posted on its website.
Myanmar, Cuba and North Korea are the only countries where Coca-
Cola doesn&#8217;t operate, the company said yesterday. Coca-Cola says
the 1971-vintage advertisement entitled &#8220;I&#8217;d Like to Buy the
World a Coke&#8221; remains one of its most popular. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PepsiCo Inc. (PEP), the world&#8217;s second-largest soft-drink maker,
pulled out of Myanmar in 1997 after shareholder groups and
activists urged the company to sever ties with the military
dictatorship because of human-rights violations. Heineken NV,
the world&#8217;s third-biggest brewer, withdrew in 1996. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi earlier this
month warned investors against &#8220;reckless optimism&#8221; in the
country&#8217;s move toward democracy. In a speech in Bangkok, her
first outside Myanmar in 24 years, Suu Kyi called job creation
her top priority and called for &#8220;healthy skepticism&#8221; of
Myanmar&#8217;s reform process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London-based WPP Plc (WPP), the world&#8217;s biggest advertising
company, and Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT), India&#8217;s biggest automaker, have
announced moves to expand in Myanmar in recent months, while
General Electric Co. and Honda Motor Co. (7267) are among other
companies considering investing in the nation. Myanmar is &#8220;set
for economic takeoff&#8221; if it implements the right policies, the
International Monetary Fund said last month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) opens the Cars Land
attraction in Anaheim, California, to the public today, part of
its largest investment ever in the theme-park unit. The
implications are broad for both earnings and succession at the
world&#8217;s largest entertainment company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 12-acre addition at California Adventure, next-door to
Disneyland, takes guests through the fictional town of Radiator
Springs from the two &#8220;Cars&#8221; movies. More than 4,000 tons of
steel and 280,000 feet (85 kilometers) of rock work were
installed, including mountains shaped like vintage Cadillac tail
fins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $1.1 billion remodeling of California Adventure,
including Cars Land, is part of a multiyear expansion of the
parks and resorts division that adds two more cruise ships,
attractions in Orlando and Hong Kong and a $4.4 billion Shanghai
park scheduled for 2015. Disney has raised prices in Anaheim in
a bet the new rides will draw consumers even as the economic
recovery remains tentative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s a crucial test, too, for Thomas Staggs, who moved over
to lead the parks unit in 2010 after 12 years as Disney&#8217;s chief
financial officer. He is seen by investors, along with Chief
Financial Officer Jay Rasulo, as a contender to be named chief
executive of Burbank, California-based Disney when Robert Iger
relinquishes the title in March 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Bob had to take Tom out of his comfort zone to give him
operational experience at what is the soul of the company, the
parks,&#8221; said David Miller, an analyst who follows Disney for
Caris  Co. in Los Angeles. &#8220;If you took a poll of 100
portfolio managers, 55 percent would say Staggs gets the job, 45
percent Rasulo. Mr. Staggs has the leg up.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Profit Margin &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staggs said he is content where he is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You get to open a park like this, makes me feel like I&#8217;ve
got one of best jobs in the world,&#8221; Staggs said at a June 13
event at Cars Land. &#8220;I&#8217;m not anxious about going anywhere
anytime soon, so as long as I can keep doing this I&#8217;m happy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parks and resorts is Disney&#8217;s second-largest unit, after
its television networks, accounting for 29 percent of sales and
18 percent of profit in fiscal 2011. The networks, led by ESPN
and Disney Channel, generated almost four times the parks unit&#8217;s
$1.55 billion in profit, on about 1 1/2 times its $11.8 billion
in revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choices to fix California Adventure and invest in other
leisure businesses were made over the past five years, even as
the company was offering discounts to entice recession-conscious
travelers to its parks, Iger said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) has ended its

flows big enough to make development profitable, Gazeta Wyborcza
reported today, citing Adam Kopysc, public and government

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ending shale gas exploration in Poland means pulling out
of further operations,&#8221; the newspaper quoted Kopysc as saying.
In addition to the two failed wells at Krasnystaw and Siennica,
Exxon Mobil has four other licenses among the 109 issued in the

&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve&#8217;s chief attorney
said central bank supervisors reviewing a trading loss of at
least $2 billion at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) haven&#8217;t found other
weaknesses, such as handling of risk, at the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Federal Reserve continues to evaluate whether the
governance, risk management and control weaknesses exposed by
this incident may be present in other parts of the firm,&#8221; Scott Alvarez, general counsel for the Board of Governors, said in
remarks prepared for testimony tomorrow to a U.S. House panel.
The text was by obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To date, we have found no evidence that they are, but
this work is not yet complete,&#8221; Alvarez said in comments to the
Financial Services Committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based JPMorgan announced its chief investment
office&#8217;s trading loss in May, prompting scrutiny among lawmakers
and regulators seeking to curb speculation by lenders with
federally insured deposits. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon
is scheduled to testify to the same House panel tomorrow after
saying last week that the bank&#8217;s switch to a new risk model may
have helped bring about the losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s shares have tumbled 15 percent since Dimon
announced the bank&#8217;s flawed positions on May 10. The &#8220;egregious
mistakes&#8221; made by the chief investment office, which oversees
about $360 billion, may cost JPMorgan an additional $1 billion,
Dimon said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Large Losses &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alvarez said in his testimony that while the bank&#8217;s losses
were large, the incident also underscored the importance of bank
capital in averting taxpayer-funded bailouts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Every dollar of these losses will be borne by JPMorgan
Chase&#8217;s shareholders, and not by depositors or taxpayers, a
result that is a function of the substantial amounts of high-
quality capital that JPMorgan holds,&#8221; Alvarez said. &#8220;The
Federal Reserve and other federal banking regulators continue to
take important steps to strengthen bank capital regulation,
especially for the largest, most complex firms.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his testimony to Congress last week, Dimon said a new
formula for estimating possible losses, implemented in January,
failed to properly account for risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 13, when Dimon downplayed the risks of trades on a
call with analysts, &#8220;we were still unaware that the model might
have contributed to the problem,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So when we found
out later on, we went back to the old model,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. central bank is &#8220;working closely&#8221; with the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which is the
regulator of the national bank, to &#8220;manage and de-risk the
portfolio in question,&#8221; Alvarez said in his prepared testimony. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed is also cooperating with the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation to &#8220;fully assess any risk-management
failures&#8221; and ensure that such issues are &#8220;promptly and
appropriately addressed,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO), the world&#8217;s
largest Spanish-language broadcaster, said it owns a 50 percent
stake in Grupo Iusacell SA after a debt conversion, giving it an
entry into Mexico&#8217;s wireless business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broadcaster said today it had agreed to terms set by
the nation&#8217;s antitrust agency to allow the company to go
forward. The Federal Competition Commission, which reversed an
earlier decision on appeal, said last week that Televisa could
complete the move if the company took steps to open itself to
more competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement ended a 14-month struggle by Mexico City-
based Televisa for the right to take on billionaire Carlos
Slim&#8217;s America Movil SAB (AMXL) in the mobile-phone business. Iusacell
has about 6 percent of Mexico&#8217;s wireless subscribers, compared
with America Movil&#8217;s 70 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa fell 1.5 percent to 55.49 pesos at the close in
Mexico City. The company paid $1.6 billion last year for
Iusacell convertible debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billionaire Ricardo Salinas, who controls Mexico&#8217;s No. 2
broadcaster TV Azteca SAB, owns the other half of Iusacell.
Azteca and Iusacell are studying the antitrust agency&#8217;s
conditions, which are &#8220;very tough, very onerous, difficult to
understand and to comply with,&#8221; Luis Nino, a spokesman for
Salinas&#8217;s group of companies, said June 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan McCosh, a spokesman for the Salinas group, said today
its position hasn&#8217;t changed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under terms of the antitrust settlement, the partnership
agreed between the Salinas group and Televisa can be dissolved
if the government fails to auction airwaves for a third
broadcast TV network in the next 24 months. Televisa and Azteca
will also have to offer cable and satellite TV providers the
option to buy their over-the-air channels separately from the
cable channels both companies produce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salinas will accept the conditions, since his companies and
Televisa proposed most of them to the antitrust agency, Vera Rossi, an analyst at Barclays Plc in New York, said today in a
research note. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, failed to win U.S. regulators&#8217; approval of its drug
to treat TTR-FAP, a rare and deadly genetic disorder affecting
8,000 people worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration asked for a second
clinical trial showing the effectiveness of tafamidis meglumine,
New York-based Pfizer said today in a statement. The pill would
be the first approved treatment in the U.S. for TTR-FAP, or
Transthyretin Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TTR-FAP robs patients of the use of their limbs from the
feet upwards, and as their digestive system turns against them,
they waste away and die in about a decade. In Europe, the drug
was approved in November for sale under the name Vyndaqel.
Pfizer estimates there are 3,000 U.S. patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;TTR-FAP is a relentless and debilitating disease. We
understand the urgent need within the patient community and
stand firmly behind this innovative medicine,&#8221; Yvonne Greenstreet, senior vice president and head of medicines
development group for Pfizer&#8217;s Specialty Care Business Unit,
said in the company&#8217;s statement. &#8220;It is our intention to
request a meeting as soon as possible with the agency in order
to discuss a potential path forward.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tafamidis works by locking down transthyretin, a protein
made by the liver. In healthy people, the protein holds
together. In those with TTR-FAP, it breaks apart, forming toxic
plaques that attack the body&#8217;s longest nerves, paralyzing limbs
and ruining the digestive system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Liver Transplant &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current treatment is a liver transplant -- the organ
produces the problematic protein and a new one can extend
patients&#8217; lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts haven&#8217;t estimated a market for the medicines.
Pfizer declined to comment on its European or potential U.S.
sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ALNY), based in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, also has a drug in early trials to treat TTR-FAP.
Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ISIS), based in Carlsbad, California, and
London-based GlaxoSmithKline Plc have teamed to develop a
treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Alnylam and Isis drugs stop production of the
transthyretin protein, said Rodney Falk, director of Boston-
based Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital&#8217;s program for cardiac
amyloidosis, a related disease where patients&#8217; heart muscles are
damaged. &lt;/p&gt;

group, and Peter Matt, Americas head of global industrials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse is adding a second leader to a group whose
clients include airlines, railroads, shipping, trucking and
logistics companies. Irwin, who has worked with United Parcel
Service Inc. and Ceva Logistics, led transportation investment
banking at Bear Stearns Cos. starting in 2001 and continued in
that role at JPMorgan after the firm acquired Bear Stearns in
2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irwin will begin his new role in September, the memo shows.
Horrocks, the current head, joined from Moelis  Co. in 2010 to
run the unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zurich-based Credit Suisse ranks fifth among financial
advisers on industrial deals so far this year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s credit-
derivatives trades that lost the biggest U.S. bank more than $2
billion were thwarted by market illiquidity, saidDavid Kelly,
director of financial engineering at Calypso Technology Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit derivatives traders value the contracts with an
assumption that if pricing relationships break down, the market
is active and deep enough that hedge funds and others that seek
to profit from such dislocations will drive the prices together,
Kelly said. Instead, by using indexes less active than benchmark
contracts and so-called tranches of the indexes that are more
difficult to trade, correlation with the rest of the market
deteriorated, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Lack of liquidity wasn&#8217;t fully appreciated or fully
considered,&#8221; Kelly, who previously helped manage counterparty
risk at JPMorgan and Citigroup Inc., said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;This thing should have been making money, but the
illiquidity and therefore the pricing distorted the normal
behavior.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon disclosed the
loss in its chief investment office on a May 10 conference call,
saying it stemmed from trades that had been designed to hedge
the bank&#8217;s credit risk. A shift in strategy that was supposed to
reduce the hedge instead turned out to be &#8220;flawed, complex,
poorly reviewed, poorly executive and poorly monitored,&#8221; Dimon
said on the call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;London Whale &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News first reported April 5 that Bruno Iksil, a
trader for the chief investment office in London, had taken on
positions that were so large he was driving price moves in the
$10 trillion market for credit-default swaps indexes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By amassing positions of as much as $100 billion in a
corporate credit-default swaps index created in 2007, Iksil
earned the nickname London Whale among some counterparties,
according to market participants who asked not to be identified
because they weren&#8217;t authorized to discuss the trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmark, known as Series 9 of the Markit CDX North
America Investment Grade Index, or IG9, had grown less active as
new versions were created every six months. Iksil also used so-
called tranches that take more concentrated risks on the
companies in the index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loss underscores the difficulty banks face in hedging
their risks and the ambiguity between those efforts and the kind
of proprietary risks that Congress is seeking to limit for
federally subsidized lenders, said Kelly, who joined Calypso in
March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Volcker Rule &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Francisco-based Calypso, founded in 1997, sells
software to banks and investment firms for managing trade
processing and risk in derivatives markets, according to the
company&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of an overhaul of financial regulations passed in
2010, Congress approved the so-called Volcker rule, named after
former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, to limit banks&#8217;
wagers on markets with their own capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he helped manage counterparty risk at JPMorgan and
Citigroup, Kelly said the desk would sometimes be given a
position to hedge that couldn&#8217;t be matched perfectly. The &#8220;big
basket&#8221; of loans on JPMorgan&#8217;s book would be impossible to
hedge symmetrically, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You can&#8217;t possibly hedge it so you&#8217;re left with a
position,&#8221; Kelly said. &#8220;You have no choice but to take some
risk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) needs to shed its
image as the world&#8217;s biggest purveyor of workplace software and
draw on its success selling the Xbox gaming console if it wants
a shot at introducing a tablet to challenge Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is expected to preview a company-branded tablet
at an event in Los Angeles today, according to people familiar
with the matter who asked not to be named because the plans
aren&#8217;t public. The devices may run Microsoft&#8217;s latest operating
system, Windows 8, and different versions may be powered by
either processors based on designs from ARM Holdings Plc or x86
chips from Intel Corp., the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the primary pitchman for its own tablets, Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft needs to assemble a compelling lineup
of applications at an attractive price, which may be tough given
the least expensive current iPad sells for $499. That&#8217;s been
impossible for challengers such as Hewlett-Packard Co. and
Research In Motion Ltd. that have tried to compete with Apple in
the tablet market, estimated to reach $78.7 billion this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Telling compelling marketing stories to consumers for the
most part is not something Microsoft has demonstrated an ability
to do,&#8221; said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at market
researcher Gartner Inc., in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xbox is the exception, he said. Microsoft has sold 67
million Xbox 360s in seven years on the market, making it the
most popular game platform, even appearing in rocker Liz Phair&#8217;s
song lyrics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Xbox Entertainment &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales surged as Microsoft transformed Xbox from a video-
game player into a full-fledged entertainment center, starting
in 2008 with the addition of Netflix Inc.&#8217;s video streaming and
the music service Last.fm. Earlier this month, Microsoft
unveiled Xbox SmartGlass, an app that will work on Windows 8 to
let smartphones, tablets and computers stream media to a screen
controlled by the console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Obviously, Microsoft is hoping this will be another
Xbox,&#8221; Gartenberg said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft might have a shot at competing with Apple if its
tablet includes the content and functionality of Xbox,
particularly if the device had a controller letting it work as a
gaming platform, said Ed Maguire, an analyst at Credit Agricole
Securities USA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When you add up all of the relationships Microsoft has
through the Xbox, Microsoft has all of the content relationships
to compete with Apple,&#8221; Maguire said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide shipments of tablets this year will be 107.4
million units, Framingham, Massachusetts-based researcher IDC
said in a June 14 report. Worldwide shipments should reach 142.8
million next year and 222.1 million by 2016, the group said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apple&#8217;s &#8216;Grip&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as companies including Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Samsung
Electronics Co. (005930) release new tablets running Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s
Android operating system, Apple&#8217;s iPad continues to dominate the
market. IDC predicts the iPad will account for 62.5 percent of
global shipments this year, up from 58.2 percent last year.
Apple&#8217;s share could rise even further if it introduces a
smaller, less expensive tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Apple&#8217;s iPad shows few signs of slowing down,&#8221; Tom Mainelli, IDC&#8217;s research director of mobile connected devices,
said in the report. &#8220;If Apple launches a sub-$300, 7-inch
product into the market later this year as rumored, we expect
the company&#8217;s grip on this market to become even stronger.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DisplaySearch, another research firm, said revenue from
tablets reached $44.9 billion worldwide in 2011 and will rise to
$78.7 billion this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pricing Challenge &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft may not be able to sell tablets running Windows
RT, the version of Windows 8 for machines with power-sipping ARM
chips, for less than $599, said Bob O&#8217;Donnell, an analyst at
IDC, in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When you look at that pricing compared to Apple, it&#8217;s a
non-starter,&#8221; said O&#8217;Donnell, whose price estimate is based on
his checks with component suppliers in Taiwan. &#8220;It appears
pricing is going to be a lot higher than people thought. From a
tablet perspective, that&#8217;s going to be a challenge.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon.com had to make several tradeoffs to get its Kindle
Fire tablet to $199, such as sporting a smaller screen size,
forgoing Bluetooth wireless connectivity and reducing on-board
memory. Sales of Amazon&#8217;s electronic books, movies and music on
the device may help make up for the narrower profit margins that
will probably result from the low price, according to Brian Blair, an analyst at Wedge Partners Corp. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s not a whole lot of room to move on price in these
devices,&#8221; Gartenberg said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apps Disadvantage &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there&#8217;s the apps issue. Tablets running Windows RT,
the machines that are most comparable to the iPad, may have
fewer apps than users are accustomed to because older software
won&#8217;t work on the devices. There are more than 200,000 apps made
specifically for the iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will make four programs in its Office suite --
Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote -- available on its tablet-
optimized operating system. That may not sway consumers who have
gladly snapped up iPads without the availability of Office, said
Michael Cherry, an analyst at Directions on Microsoft, a
Kirkland, Washington-based market-research firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe consumers are going to pay a premium on a
tablet to get those Office applications,&#8221; he said. Windows RT
tablets may not have one feature people do use -- Outlook e-mail
-- which could curb demand from corporate information technology
departments, Cherry said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through a joint venture with Barnes  Noble Inc. (BKS) announced
in April, Microsoft is developing a digital reading app for
Windows 8 that will offer a catalog of e-books, magazines and
newspapers. Barnes  Noble isn&#8217;t involved in the Microsoft
announcement today, according to a person familiar with the
matter who asked not to be named because the plans are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building Apps &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is also pulling out the stops to debut Windows
8 apps, lining up design firms, recruiting interns and sending
engineers on an around-the-world road show to help developers
get them built. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s last bid to challenge Apple by building its own
device was the Zune music and video player, which was
discontinued last year after failing to gain traction with
consumers who overwhelmingly prefer the iPod. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tablets based on Microsoft&#8217;s Windows operating system have
struggled since their initial release in 2002. The company&#8217;s
current market share? Zero, according to Gartner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The irony is, of course, Apple didn&#8217;t create this market
-- you could argue Microsoft did 10 years ago when Bill Gates
started talking about &#8216;Tablet PCs,&#8217; &#8221; said Gartenberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those ill-fated machines used a stylus instead of a touch
interface, joining the roster of tablet computer flops that
includes Hewlett-Packard&#8217;s TouchPad -- pulled after just six
weeks on the market -- RIM&#8217;s PlayBook and the Motorola Xoom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Where Apple succeeded was not by trying to force Mac OS
onto a tablet,&#8221; Gartenberg said. &#8220;They created something that
was true to the form.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank, said it will bolster the capital of its Mexican units
by $250 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move brings the firm&#8217;s total capital in Mexico to $653
million, JPMorgan said today in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank plans to use the added resources, which are still
subject to regulatory approval, to increase lending limits, and
it may also apply the money to boost equity activity at its
Mexican brokerage unit, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico is a country &#8220;where the bank is making significant
investments in recruiting and developing staff, as well as in
state of the art systems,&#8221; Eduardo Cepeda, senior country
officer for JPMorgan in Mexico, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has operated as a financial institution in Mexico
since 1994. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Deepak Gulati
is holding talks with investors as he and a team of traders
consider leaving the bank to start a hedge fund, said four
people with knowledge of the discussions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gulati, JPMorgan&#8217;s (JPM) head of global equity proprietary
trading, attended a conference held by Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
in Rome last week to meet backers, said the people, who asked
not to be identified because Gulati&#8217;s plans aren&#8217;t public. About
20 JPMorgan traders work with Gulati, who probably wouldn&#8217;t
start his firm before next year, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He follows a growing group of traders who&#8217;ve left firms
including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. since the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008 triggered a
global financial crisis and prompted regulators to try and limit
risk-taking by banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Congress in 2010 approved the so-called Volcker
rule, named after former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker,
to curtail banks from using their own capital to make wagers on
stocks and bonds. While the provision hasn&#8217;t yet gone into
effect, firms have been shutting down proprietary trading desks
to comply with the law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokesman Patrick Burton declined to comment on
Gulati&#8217;s plans. The trader, who is based in Zurich, didn&#8217;t
return a call to his office seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Volcker Rule &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank decided in 2010 to move Gulati and other
proprietary traders to its asset management business to comply
with the Volcker rule, because money would be invested on behalf
of clients. The New York-based company selected Mike Stewart to
oversee the 50 relocated traders, a person briefed on the
decision said in February 2011. The bank was considering giving
them about $2 billion of so-called seed capital, which would be
replaced with money from outside investors over time, according
to another person with knowledge of the discussions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stewart, who had been co-head of JPMorgan&#8217;s global emerging
markets business, has since left to start Whard Stewart Asset
Management Ltd., a London-based hedge fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gulati joined JPMorgan in 2003 from Dresdner Kleinwort
Ltd., according to his registration with the U.K.&#8217;s Financial
Services Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. lawmakers have called for the Volcker rule to be
stiffened after JPMorgan disclosed last month that its chief
investment office lost at least $2 billion trading derivatives.
Prior to the disclosure, JPMorgan and other lenders had urged
regulators to relax parts of the provision, arguing that strict
interpretation of the rule could stop banks from hedging risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gulati&#8217;s division is separate to the unit responsible for
the JPMorgan losses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.K. Home Secretary Theresa May said
businesses that complain about visa rules are damaging Britain&#8217;s
economic prospects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers have fielded a flood of questions from
international firms following a shakeup of visa rules by the
coalition government. Changes include a five-year cap on how
long employees who moved to the U.K. under the Intra Company
Transfer system can stay and the removal of their right to
settle permanently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister David Cameron was tackled on the subject
during a visit to Chicago last month. At a breakfast with
business leaders, Jean Spence, executive vice president at Kraft
Foods Inc. (KFT), said the rules were stopping her company bringing
people to Britain. He replied that Britain needed to control
immigration and had 5 million people on out-of-work welfare. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a lunch for journalists in London yesterday, May said
there was &#8220;headroom for business to get people into the U.K.&#8221;
She said companies were &#8220;sending a negative message. They
should be doing their bit to show we&#8217;re open for business as
well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May is in charge of meeting Cameron&#8217;s pledge to bring
annual net migration below 100,000 from about 250,000 currently.
Yesterday she described that as an &#8220;aim.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as business visas, she has tightened rules for
people bringing in family. She denied that these moves are in
conflict with promoting economic growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Devastating Trend&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A November report commissioned by the City of London
Corporation found a lack of clarity about immigration prompting
managers to postpone expansion and growth plans. It also said
some companies had lost teams to other countries, and had
reduced their U.K. headcount, an &#8220;early sign of a silent and
potentially devastating trend for the recovering U.K. economy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Home Office maintains the Intra Company Transfer route
is a temporary solution for companies needing a particular skill
set from overseas, while permanent jobs should be filled
locally. If a U.K. applicant can&#8217;t be found, an overseas
employee can use the Tier 2 general visa route, which allows for
settlement after five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We didn&#8217;t put a limit on intra-company transfers,&#8221; May
said. &#8220;Business said to us the things that mattered are intra-
company transfers and Tier 2 visas. The number of Tier 2 visas
that were given so far have been under the limit that was set.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KraussMaffei Group, the German maker
of machinery for processing plastics that is owned by Madison
Capital Partners, is working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) to
find a buyer, people familiar with the process said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which employs 3,900 and was previously owned
by KKR  Co. and Siemens AG (SIE), may fetch as much as 700 million
euros ($883 million) based on an initial assessment, said two of
the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans are
private. Information has been sent out to potential bidders,
which include private equity firms and trade buyers, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formerly known as MPM Mannesmann Plastics Machinery GmbH,
KraussMaffei was sold to Madison in 2006, according to the
German company&#8217;s website. The machinery maker had earnings
before tax, interest, depreciation and amortization of 71
million euros and sales of 950 million euros in the year ending
Sept. 30, 2007, the last year the Munich-based company disclosed
figures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German takeovers are on track to miss last year&#8217;s muted
levels as the sovereign debt crisis weighs on corporate appetite
to do deals. Still, several buyout firms are selling industrial
companies in Europe&#8217;s largest economy. Capvis Equity Partners AG
is selling Bartec Holding GmbH, a maker of explosion-resistant
switching and signaling gear, and IK Investment Partners is
disposing of industrial weighing equipment maker Schenck Process
GmbH, according to people familiar with the processes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EQT Partners AB, a Swedish buyout firm, last week agreed to
buy bandages-supplier BSN Medical in Germany&#8217;s largest buyout
since July 2008, stoking optimism among private equity firms and
bankers that deals can get done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KraussMaffei spokesman Imre Szerdahelyi declined to
comment. Spokespeople for Madison in the U.S. couldn&#8217;t be
immediately reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KraussMaffei Group is unrelated to Krauss-Maffei Wegmann
GmbH, the German armored vehicle maker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) unveiled its own
Windows-powered tablet computer called Surface, altering its
strategy of focusing on software and relying on partners to make
the machines in a renewed attempt to take on Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tablet has a 10.6-inch display and will run the new
version of Microsoft&#8217;s operating system, Chief Executive Officer
Steve Ballmer said at an event yesterday at Milk Studios in Los
Angeles. The device&#8217;s cover serves as a full keyboard with a
track pad. Surface will be available later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest software maker is stepping up its
assault on the tablet market as consumers choose the devices
over laptops, weakening personal-computer sales and curbing
Windows revenue. The new strategy threatens to sour Microsoft&#8217;s
relationship with some PC makers, many of which have been
investing to develop their own Windows 8 tablets and may not
want to compete directly with Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What can I say? Hell froze over -- this is totally
antithetical to their core business,&#8221; said Michael Gartenberg,
an analyst at Gartner Inc. &#8220;They&#8217;re taking their destiny into
their own hands. It&#8217;s a bold move, but it&#8217;s a very risky one.
This could turn into Microsoft&#8217;s next Zune or its next Xbox.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft advanced 2.9 percent to $30.70 at the close in
New York, and has climbed 18 percent this year. Apple increased
0.3 percent to $587.41. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two Versions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company wants to release Windows 8, the new version of
its software that is optimized for touch-screen tablets, in time
for the end-of-year holidays and will have a version for x86
chips from Intel Corp. and for ones based on ARM Holdings Plc&#8217;s
technology, which is also used in the iPad. The Surface tablet
will be available in versions running both chip designs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said the Surface&#8217;s price will be announced closer
to when the devices are available and will be &#8220;competitive with
a comparable ARM tablet or Intel Ultrabook-class PC.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The version for ARM will go on sale when Windows 8 is
released. The Intel-based version will be available about 90
days later, Microsoft said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ARM version of Surface weighs less than 1.5 pounds (680
grams), is 9.3 millimeters (0.37 inches) thick, has a magnesium
case and will be powered by an Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) Tegra processor, the
company said at the event. Surface also has a built-in
kickstand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Surface is something new that we think people will
absolutely love,&#8221; Ballmer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PC Market &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows 8 will arrive amid a deteriorating PC market --
research firm Gartner Inc. on June 15 cut its 2012 PC shipment
growth forecast to 2.7 percent from 4.4 percent. Tablet
shipments, by comparison, are forecast to almost double to 116
million units this year, Gartner estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s entry into the tablet market also comes as
challengers such as Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) and Research In Motion
Ltd. have failed to derail Apple&#8217;s dominance with their own
tablets. The worldwide tablet market is estimated to reach $78.7
billion this year, according to research firm DisplaySearch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LG Electronics Inc. (066570), the world&#8217;s No. 4 mobile-phone maker,
will sideline tablet development to focus more on smaller
devices rather than compete head-on with Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPad, the
Seoul-based company said in an e-mail today. LG introduced its
second tablet, named Optimus Pad LTE, earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is also teaming up with PC makers like Acer Inc.,
Toshiba Corp. and Asustek Computer Inc. to build tablets with
Windows 8, which will be called Windows RT for versions running
on ARM-based chips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apple&#8217;s Dominance &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with partners is Microsoft&#8217;s more traditional way
of operating. Apple&#8217;s success with the iPad may be pushing the
company to seek greater control over the hardware design so it
works seamlessly with the software, like Apple does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, gaining ground against Apple won&#8217;t be easy. Even as
companies including Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Samsung Electronics Co.
release new tablets running Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Android operating
system, Apple&#8217;s iPad continues to dominate the market.
Researcher IDC predicts the iPad will account for 62.5 percent
of global shipments this year, up from 58.2 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time Microsoft opted to make its own hardware
because its partners weren&#8217;t gaining traction against Apple, the
company produced the Zune music player. It didn&#8217;t fare any
better against the iPod, and Microsoft discontinued the product
last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Software Assets&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the other end of the spectrum, Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox console
is now the top-selling game machine, with 67 million units
shipped. The Xbox 360 device, which also streams television and
media content, has helped Microsoft stake a claim to customers&#8217;
living rooms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah Rotman Epps, an analyst at Forrester Research, said
Microsoft&#8217;s focus on trying to best Apple in hardware design
could backfire if Surface tablets don&#8217;t offer software that
stands out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What they didn&#8217;t show were Kinect, SmartGlass and other
software assets that could be key differentiators against the
iPad,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The months are ticking by, and the
announcement left more questions than answers about how
successful these devices will be.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After seeing early prototypes from its hardware partners,
Microsoft probably wanted to show the industry what it thinks is
a good implementation of its tablet ambitions, said Ben Bajarin,
an analyst at technology consulting firm Creative Strategies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shifting Focus &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A lot of their traditional partners have not really been
focused on the tablet market, and were planning early on to go
after new designs for traditional notebooks and desktops,&#8221;
Bajarin said. &#8220;This is an effort to drive the category in the
right direction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what may be a concession to PC partners, Microsoft will
sell the device only online and in its own retail stores, which
will number 20 by the end of the month, Gartenberg said.
Microsoft also could let vendors build their own Surface
tablets, which may sell for $499 to $699, and pay for marketing
the devices, Bajarin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the release of International Business Machines
Corp.&#8217;s first PC in 1981, Microsoft has focused on software for
the machines and left design and branding to hardware makers.
While the company has in the past decade played a larger role in
working with some PC makers on design, it has shied away from
developing the machines and selling them under the Microsoft
brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Profit Margins &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ballmer&#8217;s comments at the event indicated that Microsoft no
longer wanted to rely on its hardware partners to translate its
vision for Windows into compelling devices, said Gartenberg and
Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They clearly want to make sure at least one Windows 8
tablet is seen as a premium product, offering a premium
experience to consumers,&#8221; Enderle said. &#8220;Now they need to
execute, or they just handed Apple an early Christmas present.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The addition of a tablet or other hardware device may erode
profitability in the Windows business, which now sells just
software with operating margins of more than 60 percent. By
comparison, computer maker Dell Inc.&#8217;s operating margin for the
most recent fiscal year was about 7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are certainly running a business,&#8221; Ballmer said
backstage at yesterday&#8217;s event, though he declined to discuss
financial details. &#8220;There won&#8217;t be an advantage from a cost
perspective over our OEMs,&#8221; he said, referring to PC partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales in Microsoft&#8217;s Windows division have fallen short of
analysts&#8217; estimates in four of the past six quarters, partially
because consumers are defecting to the iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors will like the device initially and then will go
through the question of what does this do to profit margins,&#8221;
said Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities in
Portland, Oregon, who rates the shares &#8220;sector perform.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, said in a securities filing that it has paid
$896 million to resolve about 60 percent of the cases alleging
its menopause drugs caused cancer in women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has now settled about 6,000 lawsuits that claim
Prempro and other hormone-replacement drugs caused breast
cancer, and it has set aside an additional $330 million to
resolve the remaining 4,000 suits, according to a filing with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reserve means New York-based Pfizer has committed more
than $1.2 billion to resolving claims that its Wyeth and
Pharmacia  Upjohn units failed to properly warn women about the
menopause drugs&#8217; health risk. Based on the May 10 filing, the
company is paying an average of about $150,000 a case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s good for the company not to let this litigation
linger,&#8221; Les Funtleyder, a New York-based fund manager at
Miller Tabak  Co. in New York who holds Pfizer shares, said
yesterday in a phone interview. &#8220;Resolving these cases gives
investors one less thing to worry about.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 6 million women took Prempro and related
menopause drugs to treat symptoms including hot flashes and mood
swings before a 2002 study highlighted their links to cancer.
Wyeth&#8217;s sales of the medicines, which are still on the market,
exceeded $2 billion before the release of the Women&#8217;s Health
Initiative, a study sponsored by the National Institutes of
Health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Litigation Scorecard &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Premarin,
Wyeth&#8217;s estrogen-based drug, with progestin-laden Provera, made
by Upjohn, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth combined the two
hormones in its Prempro pill. Pfizer completed its $68 billion
purchase of Wyeth in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and its units have lost 11 of 21 cases over the
menopause drugs decided by juries since trials began in 2006,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker got some of the verdicts against it thrown
out after trial or had the awards reduced. It resolved some of
the verdicts through settlements, while other decisions are on
appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;After nine years of litigation involving this medicine,
we are confident in our medicine, our track record of success in
court where we have won eight of the last 10 final verdicts at
trial, and in our ability to resolve these cases on appropriate
terms,&#8221; Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;10,000 Claims &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer officials said that the $330 million reserve was an
estimate and they couldn&#8217;t be sure it would cover the remaining
cases &#8220;given the uncertainties inherent in this product
liability litigation,&#8221; according to the SEC filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the height of the litigation, Pfizer faced more than
10,000 claims that its menopause drugs caused breast cancer,
according to lawyers for former users. Those cases included more
than 8,000 claims consolidated in federal court in Arkansas and
other suits in state courts in Pennsylvania, Nevada and
Minnesota. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A majority of those cases have been resolved, according to
court and securities filings. A federal judge in Arkansas has
sent other suits back to their home courts for trial. For
example, two were returned to federal court in Connecticut to be
considered by juries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Punitive Damages &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April, a federal jury in New Haven, Connecticut, ordered
Pfizer to pay at least $4 million in damages to a woman who
developed breast cancer. The panel also ordered Pfizer to pay
punitive damages over its handling of Prempro. A judge is still
weighing how much, if any, to assess in punitives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Margaret Fraser asked U.S. District Judge Janet Arterton in a May 29 court filing to award $8 million in
punitive damages to &#8220;adequately punish Wyeth for its outrageous
conduct&#8221; in connection with the drug. Wyeth is seeking a new
trial in the case and disputes the plaintiff&#8217;s request for
punishment damages, according to court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, a separate federal jury in Bridgeport,
Connecticut, found Pfizer wasn&#8217;t liable for the breast-cancer
death of a woman who died after taking the company&#8217;s menopause
medicines. The panel in that case concluded that Wyeth officials
properly warned Lynn Moss of the drug&#8217;s risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More Trials &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoe Littlepage, a Houston-based lawyer who represents women
who haven&#8217;t settled their suits against Pfizer, said she&#8217;s
preparing for another round of trials over the claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The law firms that are left after these settlements are
eager to see that every woman gets her day in court,&#8221;
Littlepage said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We have worked long
and hard to get these cases to trial.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esther Berezofsky, a New Jersey-based lawyer representing
women suing over the menopause drugs, said her clients believe
their claims are worth more than $150,000 average paid in other
cases that settled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ll consider settling when the company decides to
fairly compensate the women I represent for the horrendous
injuries caused by these drugs,&#8221; Berezofsky said in a telephone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consolidated case in Arkansas is In re Prempro
Products, 03-cv-015070-WRW, U.S. District Court, Eastern
District of Arkansas (Little Rock). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s $2 billion
trading loss stemmed from profit-seeking bets rather than hedges
meant to mitigate loan losses, as Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has described them, banking analyst Meredith Whitney said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s very hard to argue that what Jamie Dimon is now on
the Hill for is a hedge,&#8221; Whitney said today in a radio
interview on &#8220;Bloomberg Surveillance&#8221; with Tom Keene and Ken Prewitt as the bank chief testified at a hearing of the House
Financial Services Committee in Washington. &#8220;A credit hedge in
banking should be a loan-loss provision, plain and simple.
Anything else is a proprietary bet.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon has described the loss as stemming from a hedge that
&#8220;morphed into something I can&#8217;t justify.&#8221; He has publicly
opposed the so-called Volcker rule, a Dodd-Frank Act provision
meant to limit deposit-taking lenders from making proprietary
trades, or bets with their own money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Of the large banks, JPMorgan has the lowest loan-to-
deposit ratio,&#8221; said Whitney, CEO of Meredith Whitney Advisory
Group LLC. &#8220;It didn&#8217;t frankly seem to bother anyone there
because they clearly were making money in this trading book.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitney, 42, also disputed Dimon&#8217;s claim that bank
regulation may curb lending. Dimon, 56, confronted Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke at a public forum last year,
blaming excessive regulation for slowing the U.S. economic
recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It stymies the velocity of money in the system, you have
to hold more capital,&#8221; Whitney said. &#8220;But in terms of lending,
absolutely not.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon&#8217;s performance at a Senate hearing last week went more
smoothly than Whitney expected, she said. The New York-based
bank&#8217;s shares rose 1.6 percent after his testimony last week and
advanced again today, climbing 2.1 percent to $35.36 at 2:37
p.m. in New York trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I was very surprised because it&#8217;s a very difficult trade
to explain,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He charms, he&#8217;s incredible. He gave
the senators a massage, they gave him a massage back.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s decision to
change how it measures trading risk worsened rather than
triggered the company&#8217;s $2 billion loss, Chief Executive Officer
Jamie Dimon told Congress today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It may have aggravated what happened, I wouldn&#8217;t say it
was the cause of what happened,&#8221; Dimon told the House Financial
Services Committee during a hearing in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators are probing why JPMorgan changed the gauge
called value-at-risk, or VaR, for its chief investment office in
mid-January before losses began piling up on derivatives held by
the unit. Dimon, 56, said May 10 that the new VaR erroneously
pegged risk at about half the level of the old formula, making
the potential damage look smaller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan reported the figure in its April 13 earnings
statement without telling investors about the new formula. That
has caught the attention of regulators including Securities and
Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro, who said today that
voluntary disclosures on trading risk in a news release will be
scrutinized as if they were reported in formal quarterly filings
where such information is usually published. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measure &#8220;is not required to be disclosed in the
earnings release, but if you choose to speak to it, you must
speak truthfully and completely,&#8221; Schapiro, who turned 57
today, told the House panel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon, who has been criticized by lawmakers for
serving on the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,
said district banks benefit from industry leaders&#8217; input. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If I had a board, I&#8217;d want to hear from a lot of
different types of people,&#8221; Dimon said today at a hearing of
the House Financial Services Committee in Washington. &#8220;It&#8217;d be
funny to be talking about global markets and not have someone
involved in the global markets at the table. It certainly does
not have to be me.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s trading loss of more than $2 billion has
rekindled concern that the New York Fed, the company&#8217;s principal
regulator, is too cozy with Wall Street. Senator Bernie Sanders,
a Vermont independent, along with Democrats Barbara Boxer of
California and Mark Begich of Alaska, introduced legislation
last month that would remove the industry&#8217;s executives from the
12 regional Fed banks&#8217; boards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress created the Fed almost a century ago with public
and private features, including putting three bankers on each of
the district boards along with six other directors who represent
the borrowing public. They play no part in bank supervision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The board basically sits around and talks about the
economy,&#8221; Dimon said today. &#8220;It&#8217;s more of an informational,
advisory group.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed reviews capital plans of the largest U.S. banks,
including JPMorgan, to make sure they can withstand economic
stress and in March approved Dimon&#8217;s proposal to increase the
dividend and buy back shares. The company subsequently suspended
the repurchase program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fed Bailout &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timothy F. Geithner, now the secretary of the U.S. Treasury
Department, led the New York Fed in 2008 when it bailed out
insurer American International Group Inc. and took on assets
from Bear Stearns Cos. to help JPMorgan buy the investment bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act ended the practice of banker-
directors having a vote in electing regional presidents, a move
that New York Fed President William C. Dudley said in a
September interview that he supported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke told the Joint Economic
Committee on June 7 that he would be willing to work with
Congress on a bill that would remove bankers from Fed boards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If Congress wants to change it, of course we will&#8221; work
with lawmakers, Bernanke said in response to a question from
Sanders. &#8220;Congress set this up,&#8221; and &#8220;we&#8217;ve made it into
something useful and valuable,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernanke said the Fed&#8217;s duties have been examined carefully
in the aftermath of the credit crisis, including by the
Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of
Congress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There were no actual conflicts of interest&#8221; found, he
said. The Fed has &#8220;a firewall so that the bankers do not have
any information or ability to influence supervisory decisions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey is offering $1 billion of
dollar bonds maturing in 2041 in the first such sale since
February after yields dropped to a record low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bonds were priced to yield 5.75 percent, according to
two people with direct knowledge. Yields on the bonds have
tumbled as much as 108 basis points since January, before
climbing four basis points today to 5.73 percent as of 7:10 p.m.
in Istanbul. They fell to 5.69 percent yesterday, the lowest
since an initial sale in January last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors have been returning to Turkey after the economy
grew 8.5 percent last year, reducing the country&#8217;s debt to gross
domestic product ratio to about 42 percent, the lowest in Europe
after the Czech Republic, Russia and Sweden. Banks including
Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase  Co. say Turkey&#8217;s current
account deficit, which reached a record in October, has peaked,
boosting confidence in the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I guess Turkey feels that demand is good, the cost is
acceptable and low, historically,&#8221; said Aziz Unan, who manages
$50 million of Turkish, Middle Eastern and east European assets
at Rennaisance Asset Managers in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Treasury in Ankara hired Deutsche Bank AG, Morgan
Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) for the sale, it said in a
statement on its website today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bond Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkey has sold $3.6 billion of bonds so far this year
against a target of 9.5 billion liras ($5.3 billion) for foreign
borrowing, which includes World Bank and other international
loans, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten year bonds in liras dropped 13 basis points to 8.86
percent today, the lowest level since September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Treasury last sold 10-year dollar bonds in February,
issuing $1 billion to yield 5.75 percent. The country also sold
$1.5 billion of 10-year bonds on Jan. 18 at a 6.35 percent yield
and 90 billion yen ($1.1 billion) of 10-year Samurai bonds in
March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkey initially sold $1 billion of the January 2041 bonds
at a 6 percent coupon in January 2011. The yield was 6.25
percent, data compiled by Bloomberg showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s Investors Service rates the country&#8217;s debt Ba2, two
steps below investment grade, with a positive outlook. Fitch
Ratings ranks Turkey at BB+, one step below investment grade
with a stable outlook. Standard  Poor&#8217;s cut the outlook on
Turkey&#8217;s debt to stable from positive on May 1, maintaining the
BB rating, two steps below investment grade. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leon Cooperman, who runs the $6
billion Omega Advisors Inc. hedge fund, said JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) took a &#8220;prudent risk&#8221; when it traded in credit derivatives
that have cost the bank at least $2 billion in losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We live in a very competitive economy, and banks need to
take a certain amount of risk,&#8221; Cooperman, whose New York-based
fund owns JPMorgan shares, said today in a Bloomberg Television
interview with Stephanie Ruhle. &#8220;They took the risk and it was
a prudent risk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress&#8217;s inquiry into JPMorgan&#8217;s $2 billion trading loss
has reignited the question of whether a bank can grow too large
and complex for its own executives to oversee. JPMorgan Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon is appearing today in front of the
House Financial Services Committee to answer questions regarding
the loss. He appeared before the Senate Banking Committee on
June 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooperman, 69, said he hadn&#8217;t added to his stake in
JPMorgan even as the stock has fallen about 23 percent since the
end of March. Omega owned 2.2 million shares at the end of the
first quarter, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission
filing. That position was valued at about $102 million at the
time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, he said the stock is trading at attractive values
now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For someone with a two- or three-year time horizon, you
would have a nice capital gain&#8221; if you bought the bank at these
levels, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) caught
regulators off guard with a trading loss of at least $2 billion
because the bank&#8217;s reporting lacked enough detail to raise any
alarm, the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In hindsight, if the reporting were more robust or
granular, we believe we may have had an inkling of the size and
potential complexity and risk of the position,&#8221; Comptroller
Thomas Curry said today at a hearing of the House Financial
Services Committee in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers are challenging regulators and JPMorgan Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon about a loss on credit derivatives
at the company&#8217;s chief investment office. Dimon told a Senate
panel last week that the trade, originally designed as a hedge
at the New York-based lender, &#8220;changed into something I cannot
publicly defend.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representative Carolyn Maloney, the New York Democrat,
pressed Curry on whether the loss would prompt Curry to shift
more resources to London, where JPMorgan&#8217;s loss originated.
Curry said this month that his office has five examiners at the
JPMorgan&#8217;s London office and 65 at the bank&#8217;s headquarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will use our experience here and our review of
JPMorgan Chase to reevaluate the numbers and strength of
the personnel in our London office,&#8221; Curry said today. &#8220;We
also bring to bear in our targeted examinations and overall
supervision of the bank, the entire strength of the OCC in terms
of expertise and number of examiners, which are close to 2,500
individuals.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve is expected to
start a new asset purchase program at a meeting this week,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) chief economist Jan Hatzius said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed may expand its balance sheet, extend its so-called
Operation Twist and/or lengthen its short-term interest rate
guidance beyond late 2014, Hatzius said in an e-mailed report to
clients today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A decision not to ease is tantamount to a tightening,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;At this point we&#8217;d be quite surprised if we saw no
easing.'' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed committee is expected to lower its forecast for
real economic growth and raise its forecast for the unemployment
rate &#8220;significantly,&#8221; Hatzius said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s trading loss
of at least $2 billion strengthens the argument against
Republican efforts to cut the budget of the U.S. derivatives
regulator and ease Dodd-Frank Act swaps rules, said
Representative Barney Frank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If in a very well-run bank, you can get this loss of
several billion dollars -- three and counting, we&#8217;re told -- in
a fairly short period of time, it&#8217;s an indication of the
problems with derivatives,&#8221; said the Massachusetts lawmaker,
the senior Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee,
at a hearing today looking into the bank&#8217;s trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House Agriculture Committee last month postponed a
committee meeting to vote on measures limiting the international
reach of the 2010 regulatory-overhaul law&#8217;s swaps regulations
and allow more derivatives trading to occur in federally insured
banks. Financial Services approved the same legislation in
March, before JPMorgan&#8217;s derivatives losses were disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frank criticized Republican efforts to ease swaps rules and
limit the budget of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
&#8220;which will, incredibly to me, reduce the amount they have from
this year to next year,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European Union Competition
Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said he would deepen an antitrust
investigation into Visa Europe Ltd.&#8217;s cross-border credit-card
and deferred-debit transaction fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I will take steps in the next few weeks to move forward
with our ongoing investigation of Visa,&#8221; Almunia told the
European Parliament in Brussels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almunia said last year he planned to send the company a
formal antitrust complaint. Visa Europe, operator of the largest
payment-card network in the 27-nation EU, reduced similar fees
for debit cards last year to settle a 2009 EU complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Payment transaction fees paid by retailers are &#8220;still too
high and too unequal&#8221; across the 27-nation bloc, Almunia said
last month. Regulators won backing from an EU court in May,
which confirmed their ruling that MasterCard Inc. (MA) unfairly
inflated fees payments made outside a user&#8217;s home country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe &#8220;has consistently said that it would like to
reach a commercially acceptable agreement on an appropriate
methodology for setting credit and deferred-debit interchange in
the interests of all stakeholders in the payments industry,&#8221;
Amanda Kamin, a spokeswoman for Visa Europe in London, said in
an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almunia said he wanted to explore &#8220;a solution that would
provide legal certainty&#8221; to the entire payments cards industry
and didn&#8217;t exclude regulation for card fees. Any rules for the
payment industry would need to be proposed by his colleague, EU
Financial Services Commissioner Michel Barnier, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called interchange fee, based on Visa&#8217;s guidelines,
is paid by the retailer&#8217;s bank to the bank that issued the
customer&#8217;s card. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe split from Visa Inc. (V) before the U.S. card
company&#8217;s initial public offering in early 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SodaStream (SODA) International Ltd.
already told Coca-Cola (KO) Co. it wouldn&#8217;t stop using Coke bottles
in its marketing. Now SodaStream is taking the fight to the
company&#8217;s front door -- or at least the park across the street
from Coke&#8217;s World of Coca-Cola museum in Atlanta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 22, SodaStream, which sells do-it-yourself soft-
drink machines, plans to erect a car-sized cage at Centennial
Olympic Park, filled with thousands of used soft-drink bottles
and cans. The point: Buying packaged drinks clogs up landfills,
while making soda at home helps save the planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar display at a South Africa airport has drawn
threats of a lawsuit by Coca-Cola, the world&#8217;s largest beverage
maker with a market value of about $170 billion, 228 times
larger than SodaStream. The upstart uses 30 such displays around
the globe to take issue with the waste created by big soda
companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No one&#8217;s going to shut us up with a lawyer&#8217;s letter,&#8221;
SodaStream Chief Executive Officer Daniel Birnbaum said today in
a telephone interview. &#8220;Not in South Africa or anywhere.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After SodaStream, based in Airport City, Israel, refused to
comply with a lawyer&#8217;s letter from Coca-Cola dated June 8, Coke
hand-delivered a second letter which Birnbaum got this week, he
said. Coke went after a display at O.R. Tambo International
Airport in Johannesburg and demanded all others be removed, as
well, according to the first letter. The company alleged
trademark infringement and a breach of local advertising
standards. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the Volcker Rule may have been able to influence
the outcome of JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s $2 billion trading loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernanke said documentation of a trade&#8217;s rationale, an
auditing process, governance rules and compensation limits that
are part of the proposed Volcker Rule may have played a role in
changing the result at the largest U.S. bank. The legislation
aims to limit proprietary trading while allowing exemptions for
market-making and hedging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One relevant feature of the rule &#8220;would have been the
control of governance aspects,&#8221; Bernanke said today at a news
conference. &#8220;That might have potentially changed the outcome.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five banking regulators, including the Fed and the Treasury
Department&#8217;s Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, are
finalizing the Volcker Rule. Regulators have struggled with
whether JPMorgan&#8217;s trade would have been allowed under the
proposal&#8217;s exemption for portfolio trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has been under tougher regulatory scrutiny since
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said May 10 that the firm&#8217;s
chief investment office suffered the loss. He later called it
&#8220;a Risk 101 mistake.&#8221; Regulator probes began after traders in
the London office, which manages the bank&#8217;s excess cash, made
wrong-way bets on illiquid credit derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed, as the regulator of bank holding companies, is
helping oversee JPMorgan&#8217;s efforts to manage and eliminate risk
from its portfolio. The Fed is looking at other parts of the
bank&#8217;s holding company to determine if governance, risk
management and control weaknesses are present elsewhere, Federal
Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo said in a June 6 Senate Banking
Committee testimony. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s vaccine Prevnar 13,
used to prevent pneumococcal disease, should be given to adults
with weakened immune systems, according to a U.S. panel that
recommends vaccination schedules to doctors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Advisory Committee on Vaccine Practices voted
today that people with AIDS, cancer, organ transplants, advanced
kidney disease and other immune-weakening conditions should
receive the vaccine. The recommendation includes people who&#8217;ve
already had Merck  Co. (MRK)&#8217;s Pneumovax 23, a competitor to New
York-based Pfizer&#8217;s product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration in December approved
Prevnar 13 for use in adults at least 50 years old. The vaccine
panel, part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta, recommends vaccinations to doctors and has yet to
decide whether all adults 50 years old and older should get
Prevnar 13. Such a ruling would be a major sales boost to sales
of the product, Tony Butler, an analyst with Barclays Capital,
said in a note to clients in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said it will continue to urge the panel to support
giving the vaccine to all adults at least 50 years old. A
company study of Prevnar in 84,000 people 65 and older should
have results by 2013, the drugmaker said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If recommended in the older population, Pfizer&#8217;s vaccine
would go head-to-head with Merck&#8217;s product. &#8220;It is important
for clinicians to continue to focus on implementing the ACIP&#8217;s
long-standing recommendation for use of only Pneumovax 23 to
help protect all adults aged 65 and older, as well as adults 19
and older,&#8221; Mark Feinberg, chief science of Whitehouse Station,
New Jersey-based Merck&#8217;s vaccine division, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization estimates that 1.6 million
people die each year from pneumococcal infections. Pfizer&#8217;s
vaccine generated $941 million in the first quarter, and was the
drugmaker&#8217;s third-best-selling product behind the cholesterol
pill Lipitor and pain drug Lyrica. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer fell less than 1 percent to $22.67 at the close in
New York. Merck declined less than 1 percent to $39.21. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BP Plc (BP/) was the high bidder on 43
leases to drill in the central Gulf of Mexico where two years
ago its Macondo well exploded, causing the largest U.S. offshore
oil spill. The U.S. auction raised $1.7 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) offered $406.6 million, or 24 percent
of all the bids, followed by Statoil (STL) ASA with $333.3 million,
the Interior Department said. Stavanger, Norway-based Statoil
bid $157 million for a single tract, a record in the region,
Tommy Beaudreau, director of the department&#8217;s Bureau of Ocean
Energy Management, said today. BP&#8217;s total bids were $239.5
million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As the largest leaseholder in the deep waters of the Gulf
of Mexico, we remain committed to continuing investment in this
important U.S. energy source,&#8221; Scott Dean, a BP spokesman, said
today by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration, pressured by Republicans to boost
domestic oil production, auctioned tracts off the coast of
Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi that it said may produce more
than 1 billion barrels of oil. The previous auction in the
central Gulf, about a month before the April 2010 BP disaster,
raised $949.3 million for the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP is acquiring leases in a region where the London-based
company lost control of the Macondo well in a blowout that
destroyed a $365 million drilling rig, killed 11 workers and
spewed about 4.9 million of barrels of oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;In Business&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Gulf of Mexico is back in business,&#8221; Interior Secretary
Ken Salazar said as the sale began today in New Orleans. He said
the companies can begin preparing for exploration immediately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Apache Corp. (APA), LLOG
Exploration Offshore LLC, Stone Energy Corp. (SGY), Noble Energy Inc. (NBL)
and ConocoPhillips (COP) were among the 10 biggest bidders, according
to a list posted today on the Interior Department website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The administration is opening the central Gulf as
Republicans in Congress demand accelerated domestic output to
add jobs and reduce dependence on overseas sources. The BP oil
spill prompted an overhaul of rules for deepwater drilling after
a six-month halt in the Gulf to review safety. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If we continue to drill in the Gulf of Mexico, especially
in deep water, we will have another spill,&#8221; Jacqueline Savitz,
vice president for North America at Washington-based
environmental group Oceana, said in a phone interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deep Waters &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leases in waters deeper than 1,600 meters (5,250 feet)
accounted for more than 53 percent of all the high bids, or $906
million, and almost 10 times more than tracts in water 400
meters or shallower, according to the Interior Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production in the Gulf region increased 6.2 percent to 1.41
million barrels a day in March, and represented more than a
fifth of the U.S. crude production for the month, according to
the Energy Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With oil trading at about $80 a barrel on global markets,
the Gulf of Mexico is the world&#8217;s most profitable place to
produce oil, because other nations set higher taxes on oil
companies, said Fadel Gheit, an analyst at Oppenheimer  Co. in
New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Whether it&#8217;s the U.K., whether it&#8217;s Algeria, Nigeria,
West Africa, Russia, anywhere you go, the effective tax rate is
very high,&#8221; Gheit said in an interview. The Gulf &#8220;is well
developed, the whole area is basically very well mapped, there
are not too many surprises, the industry has all the services
needed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the BP disaster, the Interior Department revamped
its oversight of drilling, dividing the leasing function from
enforcement of safety rules and collection of production

casing and cementing, and introduced a requirement for subsea
oil-spill containment system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nonprofit group commissioned by the agency also

company-leases helicopters and live for a time with workers, the
National Research Council said in report released yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, will release a new version of the Windows Phone
program in handsets this fall, part of a broad effort to gain
ground against Apple Inc. and Google Inc. (GOOG) in mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows Phone 8 has the same core software as the new
Windows 8 operating system for personal computers and tablets,
meaning it can be used in a variety of phone models at different
prices, the company said at an event in San Francisco today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft finished the first quarter with a 2.2 percent
share of the mobile-phone operating system market, dwarfed by
Apple&#8217;s iOS and Google&#8217;s Android software, according to
researcher IDC. Along with the unveiling earlier this week of
its own tablet computer, called Surface, the Redmond,
Washington-based company is stepping up its challenge as
consumers rely more on mobile-computing devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Windows Phone 8 is a significant improvement,&#8221; said Al Hilwa, an analyst at IDC. &#8220;It brings the capabilities up to par
with Android. The question of whether this pace of research and
development is fast enough remains, because of the sheer
velocity with which Android is moving.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android was the smartphone market leader in the first
quarter, with a 59 percent share, and Apple (AAPL) followed with 23
percent, IDC said. Symbian software from Nokia Oyj (NOK1V), the Finnish
handset maker Microsoft teamed up with last year to create new
smartphones running Windows, trailed in third place with a 6.8
percent slice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trading in the credit derivatives
index that contributed to JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s losses in its
London chief investment office soared to a record yesterday in a
sign that the biggest U.S. bank may be unwinding its position,
according to data cited by Credit Suisse Group AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volume in Series 9 of the Markit CDX North America
Investment Grade Index surged the past two days, with a record
$31 billion of the contracts, which expire December 2017, traded
yesterday, Credit Suisse traders said today in an e-mail to
market participants, citing data from Markit Group Ltd. That
compares with an average of $2 billion to $3 billion, the
traders said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is seeking to stem at least $2 billion in trading
losses from the U.K. operation, where Bruno Iksil, known as the
London Whale, managed a portfolio of credit derivatives so large
it distorted the market. A strategy by the unit to reduce risks
from hedges backfired and left the bank with even bigger and
harder-to-manage exposures, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon
said last week before the Senate Banking Committee in
Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They are trying to unwind, and they probably have been
trying to do some of it on a quiet basis,&#8221; Scott MacDonald,
head of research at MC Asset Management Holdings LLC in
Stamford, Connecticut, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;When you
put on a large trade, it&#8217;s hard for people not to notice what
you&#8217;re doing. It&#8217;s been a very tough situation for them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), UBS AG (UBSN) and two
other banks won an attempt to block U.K. prosecutors from
seizing documents that Italian authorities sought to use at a
criminal trial over derivatives, a London judge ruled today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lenders, along with Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and Depfa Bank
Plc, won a ruling quashing a request for information from the
U.K. Serious Fraud Office, Judge Peter Gross said in a judgment
issued today in London. The SFO had an &#8220;obvious lack of
authority&#8221; in the case, Gross said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is with considerable reluctance that I have come to
the conclusion that assistance should not be given in this case
in response to the letter of request&#8221; from the Milan
prosecutor, Gross said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors in Milan accused the four banks, which arranged
swaps for the city to restructure its debt, of misleading
municipal officials and earning 101 million euros ($128 million)
in hidden fees from the deals. The banks, which deny the fraud
charges, settled with the city government in a separate civil
case in March and agreed to unwind its interest-rate swaps,
which adjusted payments on 1.7 billion euros of bonds sold in
2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks told the London court in May that the SFO
shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to use &#8220;coercive measures&#8221; that wouldn&#8217;t
be available to prosecutors in Italy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Considerable Sympathy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In its ruling today, the court expressed a considerable
degree of sympathy for the position of both the Home Secretary
and the SFO,&#8221; David Jones, a spokesman for the U.K. prosecution
agency, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials at the four banks all declined to comment. Milan
prosecutor Alfredo Robledo didn&#8217;t immediately return calls
seeking comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prosecutor leading the Milan case used the accounts of
an Italian bank on a similar transaction to show that lenders
set terms in their favor in swap deals. A witness testified
during a trial in Milan over the derivatives sales that the
city&#8217;s swaps may have broken rules on how municipalities can use
derivatives, partly because they were used to raise funds
instead of hedging risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is: The Queen on the application of UBS Limited
v. Serious Fraud Office, CO/3165/2012, High Court of Justice,
Queen&#8217;s Bench Division. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada Pension Plan Investment Board
beat Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) in an auction to be the lead
investor in a $1 billion transaction to take over assets of a
2001 fund managed by private-equity firm Behrman Capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada Pension, the country&#8217;s second-biggest public pension
manager, agreed to commit as much as $644.4 million to Behrman
Capital PEP LP, a new fund with a six-year life that will buy
assets from the original Behrman fund, according to marketing
documents. The new fund is seeking $1.07 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction gives investors the option of exiting their
stakes in Behrman Capital III LP, a $1.2 billion fund formed 11
years ago. They can also choose to invest in the new pool, which
has reserved $100 million for such rollover commitments,
according to the documents, copies of which were obtained by
Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behrman, based in New York, is among a number of private-
equity firms seeking to resolve the future of funds that are
reaching the end of their designated lives without having sold
all their investments. Willis Stein  Partners, a buyout firm
that last raised capital more than a decade ago, is trying to
divest most of its remaining holdings, two people familiar with
the deal said in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Five Companies &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linda Sims, a spokeswoman for Toronto-based Canada Pension,
declined to comment, as did Bill Murphy, a managing director at
Cogent Partners, which handled the auction for Behrman Capital.
Grant Behrman, co-founder of the firm, didn&#8217;t return a call for
comment, while Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs,
didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new fund will use 75 percent of commitments to purchase
existing stakes in five companies primarily held by Behrman
Capital III. The companies are Ark Holding Co., ILC Holdings
Inc., New ILC Dover Inc., Pelican Products Inc. and Selig
Sealing Holdings Inc., the documents show. Other funds have
minority stakes in the companies, including Behrman Capital IV
LP, which raised $251 million in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remaining capital will be used to fund new investments,
primarily in the health-care, defense, specialty manufacturing
or business-to-business outsourcing industries in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal will give Behrman Capital III investors net
proceeds of $780.6 million after fees, representing 102.4 percent
of net asset value as of Dec. 31. The general partner will
receive a cut of profits from the transaction and 20 percent of
a $40 million exit fee paid by the portfolio companies, according
to one of the documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fee Changes &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behrman Capital reduced the proposed management fee on the
new fund to 0.75 percent from an originally proposed 1.25
percent in March. It has increased the proposed carried interest
fee to 20 percent from 15 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behrman Capital III is near the end of its life, having
already received investor approval for two of three one-year
extensions beyond its 10-year term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal has passed muster with the advisory boards of Fund
III and Fund IV and is pending approval from Behrman investors,
who face a deadline of today, the documents show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behrman Capital was founded by brothers Grant Behrman and
Darryl Behrman in 1991. Darryl passed away in February 2002. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) President
and Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn said he would like to be
chief executive officer of the firm and is &#8220;very happy&#8221; in his
current job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Of course I would like to be CEO of Goldman Sachs, but I
am very happy in the job I am in now,&#8221; Cohn, 51, said today in
an interview with Erik Schatzker on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s
&#8220;Market Makers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Lloyd C. Blankfein succeeded Henry M. Paulson as
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s chairman and CEO six years ago, Cohn was named
as one of Blankfein&#8217;s top lieutenants, making him a leading
candidate to be the next head of the firm. Blankfein said last
week that he has a &#8220;tough job to leave,&#8221; and that most of his
predecessors left for government jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would say the government isn&#8217;t going to call me up,&#8221;
Blankfein told reporters after participating in a discussion at
the Chicago Club in Chicago. &#8220;So that means staying forever or
dying at my desk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, has
declined 25 percent since March 26 as investors became more
concerned about the European debt crisis and analysts cut profit
outlooks for banks. JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s $2 billion trading
loss, announced May 10, has led some analysts to predict
regulators will craft tougher rules to keep lenders from making
speculative bets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs probably will earn $2.03 a share in the
second quarter, according to the average estimate of 25 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank, is poised to more than double the value of its
investment in London Metal Exchange shares bought seven months
ago from the U.K. unit of bankrupt MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the biggest investor in the LME, with 1.4
million shares valued at 150.6 million pounds ($236.8 million)
after Hong Kong Exchanges  Clearing Ltd. agreed to buy the
London bourse at 107.60 pounds a share. The New York-based bank
increased its stake in November when it agreed to buy 600,000
shares from MF Global U.K. Ltd. at 41.92 pounds apiece. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To say the price is very full and very generous to LME
shareholders is an understatement,&#8221; said Peter Lenardos, an
analyst at RBC Capital Markets in London. &#8220;The capital gain for
them is massive. It&#8217;s an outstanding investment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Exchanges, which owns the fifth-largest equity
market by market capitalization, offered 1.39 billion pounds on
June 15 for the LME, which handled a record $15.4 trillion of
contracts last year. The takeover would give the Asian exchange
its first commodities business and the London bourse better
access to China, the biggest user of everything from aluminum to
zinc. LME shareholders will vote on the bid by the end of July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global, based in New York, filed the eighth-largest U.S.
bankruptcy on Oct. 31 with debt of almost $40 billion after
making wrong-way bets on sovereign debt. The 41.92 pounds paid
by JPMorgan for MF Global&#8217;s shares compared with a previous sale
of LME stock at 4.925 pounds in July. The 135-year-old LME had
said in September it received &#8220;several expressions of
interest&#8221; for the exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Final Offers&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While a condition on a price adjustment for any
subsequent sale of the shares at a higher price was part of the
sale negotiations, none of the nine parties who made final
offers were prepared to agree to this condition,&#8221; Mike Pink,
joint special administrator of MF Global U.K. at KPMG LLP, said
in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kate Haywood, a London-based spokeswoman for JPMorgan,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) raised its stake in the LME by
330,000 shares to 1.23 million in the year through September,
according to U.K. Companies House filings. Lehman Brothers
International Europe, the bankrupt London unit of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., transferred its 330,000 LME shares on
July 1, according to Companies House. Goldman has never said
whether it acquired those shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Metdist Trading &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s total stake is valued at 132.3 million pounds
under the terms of Hong Kong Exchanges&#8217; offer. Joanna Carss, a
spokeswoman for Goldman in London, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metdist Ltd. and Metdist Trading Ltd., U.K. metals trading
companies owned by the Bagri family, have a combined 1.21
million LME shares, making the group the third-largest
shareholder. Its stake is valued at 130.4 million pounds, or
about 165 times Metdist Ltd.&#8217;s profit in 2011. The company&#8217;s
fiscal year ended March 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raj Bagri, who was chairman of the LME from 1993 to 2002,
is a director of Metdist Ltd. and Metdist Trading Ltd.,
according to Companies House filings in 2011. His son Apurv
Bagri is also named as a director of the two companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sucden Financial Ltd. with 362,000 shares, would make about
39 million pounds if it sold its stake. The broker&#8217;s profit in
2011 was 9.04 million pounds on operating profit of 10.9 million
pounds, according to a Companies House filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triland Metals Ltd., which has 300,000 shares, would gain
32.3 million pounds on the sale of the LME. The broker&#8217;s profit
for 2011 was 9.68 million pounds, compared with 12.9 million
pounds the year before. Its fiscal year ended March 31,
according to Companies House. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;LME Shares &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LME issues two share classes. There are 12.9 million
ordinary shares conferring ownership and voting rights.
JPMorgan, Metdist Trading, Sucden Financial and Triland Metals
are category 1 members of the bourse, giving them the right to
trade on the floor of the exchange. Goldman is a category 2
member, which means it can&#8217;t participate in the so-called ring,
home to London&#8217;s last open-outcry trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The takeover needs the approval of the U.K. Financial
Services Authority as well as LME shareholders. It doesn&#8217;t need
shareholder consent in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. House members criticized
regulators yesterday for failing to detect JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM)&#8217;s loss of at least $2 billion on risky derivatives trades
and pressed for additional measures to ensure similar losses
don&#8217;t occur in other banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heads of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the Securities and Exchange
Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission, along with
a senior Federal Reserve official offered testimony about the
loss at a House Financial Services Committee hearing in
Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, who began his
testimony later, described the loss as &#8220;embarrassing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers pressed regulators to explain how they monitored
activities U.S. banks conduct overseas. The trades that
triggered JPMorgan&#8217;s loss were conducted in London, potentially
beyond the reach of U.S. derivatives regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon defended the company&#8217;s disclosures of a $2 billion
trading loss as regulators and lawmakers questioned whether the
largest U.S. bank misled investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We disclosed what we knew when we knew it,&#8221; Dimon,
making his second appearance on Capitol Hill in less than a
week, said yesterday at a House Financial Services Committee
hearing in Washington that exceeded four hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comptroller Thomas J. Curry said his agency is reviewing
its staffing inside JPMorgan&#8217;s London operations in the wake of
the loss. SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro told lawmakers that
JPMorgan could pay a penalty if the agency concludes that the
bank improperly disclosed the risk that contributed to the loss.
The SEC has a &#8220;wide panoply&#8221; of sanctions and penalties at its
disposal in pursuing a case against JPMorgan and the bank could
pay penalties if investigators find that it has violated
disclosure or other rules, Schapiro said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott Alvarez, the Fed&#8217;s general counsel, said the central
bank is reviewing JPMorgan&#8217;s risk management practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, regulators didn&#8217;t provide new information about the
loss and lawmakers used the hearing to reprise the broader
debate over financial regulation. Committee Chairman Spencer
Bachus pointed to the regulators bunched at the witness table as
an example of the continued complexity of financial oversight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon&#8217;s opening statement was nearly identical to his
remarks in front of the Senate Banking Committee last week.
During that hearing, Dimon apologized for the losses and said he
felt &#8220;terrible&#8221; that shareholders would lose money because of
the chief investment office&#8217;s trading strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon also said that Congress should limit the
international reach of Dodd-Frank Act swaps regulations. In
addition, Dimon said that district banks of the Federal Reserve
benefit by having industry leaders&#8217; input. Dimon has been
criticized by lawmakers for serving on the board of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s hearing was the first held by the House on the
trading losses, which have drawn inquiries from the SEC, CFTC
and Department of Justice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC&#8217;s review of JPMorgan&#8217;s trading loss has focused on
how JPMorgan disclosed a change to a complicated risk
calculation. When companies disclose their &#8220;value at risk&#8221; or
VaR, they &#8220;must speak truthfully and completely,&#8221; Schapiro
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers on the House committee, much like those on its
Senate counterpart, have benefited from JPMorgan&#8217;s campaign
donations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Hedges Were Really Prop Trades, Whitney Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s $2 billion trading loss stemmed from
profit-seeking bets rather than hedges meant to mitigate loan
losses, as Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has described
them, banking analyst Meredith Whitney said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitney made the remarks yesterday in a radio interview on
&#8220;Bloomberg Surveillance&#8221; with Tom Keene and Ken Prewitt as the
bank chief testified at a hearing of the House Financial
Services Committee in Washington. &#8220;A credit hedge in banking
should be a loan-loss provision, plain and simple. Anything else
is a proprietary bet.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitney, 42, also disputed Dimon&#8217;s claim that bank
regulation may curb lending. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Himes Asks Why No One Knew About JPMorgan Trading Loss &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Representative James Himes, a Connecticut Democrat and
a member of the House Financial Services Committee, talked about
yesterday&#8217;s testimony to the panel by JPMorgan Chase  Co. Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon about the bank&#8217;s $2 billion
trading loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Himes spoke with Betty Liu and Peter Cook on Bloomberg
Television&#8217;s &#8220;In the Loop.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the video, click here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Schweikert Says Dimon Did &#8216;Pretty Good Job&#8217; at Hearing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Representative David Schweikert, an Arizona Republican
and member of the House Financial Services Committee, talked
about JPMorgan Chase  Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon&#8217;s
testimony before the panel yesterday about the bank&#8217;s $2 billion
trading loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He talked with Peter Cook on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s
&#8220;Bottom Line.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Arthur Levitt Says Dimon Hearing Only &#8216;Theater&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arthur Levitt, former chairman of the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission, talked about JPMorgan Chase  Co. Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon &#8217;s testimony before the Senate
Banking Committee yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levitt, who spoke with Stephanie Ruhle and Erik Schatzker
on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;Market Movers,&#8221; also discussed
regulations and the outlook for the banking industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;House&#8217;s Frank Says JPMorgan Losses Show Need for Swaps Oversight &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s trading loss of at least $2 billion
strengthens the argument against Republican efforts to cut the
budget of the U.S. derivatives regulator and ease Dodd-Frank Act
swaps rules, said Representative Barney Frank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frank said that if a &#8220;very well-run bank&#8221; can sustain a
loss of this size, &#8220;it&#8217;s an indication of the problems with
derivatives.&#8221; Frank, a Massachusetts lawmaker, is the senior
Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee. He made the
remarks at a hearing yesterday looking into the bank&#8217;s trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House Agriculture Committee last month postponed a
committee meeting to vote on measures limiting the international
reach of the 2010 regulatory-overhaul law&#8217;s swaps regulations
and allow more derivatives trading to occur in federally insured
banks. Financial Services approved the same legislation in
March, before JPMorgan&#8217;s derivatives losses were disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.K. to Give Shareholders Votes on Top Pay, Boost Disclosure &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public companies in the U.K. will have to give shareholders
binding votes on executive-pay structures every three years,
Business Secretary Vince Cable told lawmakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other measures in the package, to take effect in October
2013, will require companies to publish a single figure for what
each director is paid in total, their pension entitlement and a
chart comparing the company&#8217;s performance and the chief
executive officer&#8217;s pay. When directors leave, the company will
have to publish &#8220;promptly&#8221; a statement of their payoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study last year by the High Pay Commission, a pressure
group that pushes for curbs on top earners, found British
directors&#8217; salaries increased by 64 percent over the past
decade, while the average year-end share price of FTSE 100
companies fell 71 percent. The average annual bonus for
directors rose 187 percent, according to the panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is compelling evidence of a disconnect between pay
and performance in large U.K.-listed companies,&#8221; Cable said in
a statement to Parliament today. &#8220;It is right that the
government acts to address this clear market failure.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cable said he hoped that having votes on pay structures
every three years, rather than annually, will encourage longer-
term thinking. If a company changes its structures, it&#8217;ll be
forced to have a fresh vote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moves, which will be implemented through amendments to
the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill currently before
Parliament, are aimed partly at ending &#8220;golden goodbye&#8221;
packages for departing executives, often criticized as rewards
for failure. The policy on exit payments will be part of the
package that shareholders vote on, and companies won&#8217;t be able
to go beyond it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Developing Economies Warn of Damage From Basel, Volcker Rules &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global regulators are being urged by some developing
countries to amend plans that would force banks to boost their
capital and liquid assets, expressing concerns the measures may
harm their economies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A survey of developing and emerging economies conducted by
the Financial Stability Board revealed concerns that the
measures, drawn up in the wake of the 2008 collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., &#8220;could have adverse consequences and
may ultimately impact the development of domestic financial
markets in those countries.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nations are also concerned that U.S. proposals to ban
commercial banks from proprietary trading, known as the Volcker
Rule, may damage their &#8220;government, corporate securities and
derivatives markets,&#8221; the FSB said in the report, submitted
yesterday to a meeting of the Group of 20 nations in Los Cabos,
Mexico, and published on the FSB&#8217;s website. It didn&#8217;t name the
countries included in the survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators and lenders have clashed over how to implement
the international bank-capital and liquidity standards, which
are set to become fully effective in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specific concerns named in the report include that the new
rules might make it more expensive for lenders to provide so-
called trade finance services, the FSB said. There is also a
more general concern lenders will scale back activities outside
their core markets, the board said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;EU Lawmakers Seek to Scrap Credit-Ratings Rotation Plan &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Union lawmakers voted to scrap most of a proposal
to force businesses to rotate the credit-ratings company they
hire to assess their debt, while backing tighter restrictions on
sovereign-debt ratings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Parliament&#8217;s economic and monetary affairs
committee voted yesterday in Brussels to scale back the proposed
rotation requirement so that it would apply only to
securitizations and other kinds of so-called structured finance.
The stance brings the Parliament&#8217;s position largely into line
with that of EU national governments, which must also approve
the new rules proposed by the bloc&#8217;s regulators last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission, the 27-nation EU&#8217;s regulatory arm,
proposed the rotation rule last year as part of a draft law to
toughen regulation of the ratings industry amid concerns that
some of its decisions exacerbated the euro-area debt crisis. The
commission said rotation would boost competition and solve
potential conflicts of interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the commission&#8217;s original rotation proposal,
companies would have been obliged to change the company that
they pay to rate their credit every three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parliament and national governments must now begin
discussions on a final compromise bill before the legislation
can become law. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;EU Nations Said to Be Split Over Lending Plan for Failing Banks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Union nations are split over plans to force
governments to lend to each other as a last resort to stabilize
crisis-hit banks, according to two people familiar with the
matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany and Sweden are among nations opposing the move,
part of a broader proposal to take taxpayers off the hook for
bank rescues, said the people, who couldn&#8217;t be identified
because the talks are private. The plan, discussed by diplomats
at a meeting in Brussels June 18, received support from other
nations, including Italy and France. The U.K. has previously
said that it was opposed to such funds as they could encourage
lenders to take excessive risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michel Barnier, the EU financial services chief, proposed
setting up a network of national bank-financed funds to shore up
crisis-hit lenders in a draft law this month. He said the
measure was needed to prevent a repeat of the public bailouts
that occurred in the 2008 financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preben Aaman, a spokesman for the Danish presidency of the
EU, and Stefaan De-Rynck, spokesman for Barnier, declined to
immediately comment. The proposals need to be approved by
nations and by lawmakers in the European Parliament before they
can enter into force. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Universal Gets EU Antitrust Complaint Citing EMI Bid Concerns &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vivendi SA (VIV)&#8217;s Universal Music Group said it received an
antitrust complaint from European Union regulators citing
concerns over its bid for EMI Group&#8217;s recorded-music business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission has &#8220;provided us today with a
statement of objections,&#8221; Adam White, a spokesman for Universal
in London, said in an e-mail yesterday. &#8220;We will continue to
work closely with the commission and look forward to securing
regulatory clearance.&#8221; He said Universal is preparing a
detailed response to regulators&#8217; concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A statement of objections sets out regulators&#8217; case for
blocking a deal. Companies may seek an oral hearing and can
offer to sell assets to resolve any concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators have a Sept. 6 deadline to rule on the bid by
Universal, which they have said would create a company &#8220;almost
twice the size of the next largest player&#8221; in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for the European Commission
in Brussels, declined to comment on the statement of objections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blue Index Founder Sanders Gets 4 Years for Insider Trading &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The co-owners of the now-defunct spread-betting firm Blue
Index Ltd. and one of their wives were sentenced to a total of
68 months in prison for insider trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Sanders was sentenced to four years in prison while
another owner, James Swallow, was sentenced to 10 months.
Sanders wife, Miranda, also received a 10-month term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanders pleaded guilty to 10 charges, according to the U.K.
Financial Services Authority. He faced as long as six years in
prison if he hadn&#8217;t pleaded guilty, Justice Peregrine Simon said
at the hearing in London today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanders&#8217;s wife, Miranda, pleaded guilty to five counts of
insider trading, and Swallow to three charges before the trial,
according to the FSA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former senior trader at the brokerage, Christopher
Hossain, and another man, Adam Buck, were cleared of similar
charges last month after a five-week trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profits generated by the defendants from the inside
information were about 1.9 million pounds ($2.99 million), while
Blue Index clients reaped about 10.2 million pounds, the FSA has
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interviews &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;High-Frequency Definition Needed for New Rules, O&#8217;Malia Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-frequency trading should be defined before the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission sets rules for what amounts
to about half of the volume of futures markets, said Scott
O&#8217;Malia, a member of the panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CFTC needs a better understanding of the practices as
it debates new testing and supervision rules for high-frequency
and automated trading, O&#8217;Malia said in a speech prepared for a
Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association conference
yesterday in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CFTC, with the Securities and Exchange Commission, has
scrutinized such trading since May 6, 2010, when $862 billion
was erased from stock values in 20 minutes in the so-called
&#8220;flash crash.&#8221; The agency has been drafting a release on new
rules, a regulatory step prior to proposed rules. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Comings and Goings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;RBS to Cut 618 Financial-Planning Jobs, Charge for Advice &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, the U.K.&#8217;s biggest
taxpayer-controlled lender, is eliminating 618 branch-based
financial advisers as regulators force lenders to charge clients
for the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBS is also creating 351 financial-planning jobs as a
result of the rule changes, the Edinburgh-based bank said in a
statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Services Authority&#8217;s Retail Distribution
Review will from the end of 2012 prevent the payment of
commissions to advisers, and lenders are preparing to charge for
the service. HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) said in June last year it was
cutting 700 employees offering face-to-face advice in branches
while Barclays Plc (BARC), Britain&#8217;s second-largest bank, said in
January last year it would cut 1,000 employees as a result of
the regulations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBS Chief Executive Officer Stephen Hester has shrunk
assets by more than 700 billion pounds ($1.1 trillion) and cut
about 36,000 jobs since he took over from Fred Goodwin in 2008
at the bank. RBS said in January it would cut about 3,500 jobs
at its investment bank, citing volatile markets and the cost of
new U.K. regulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Indonesia Central Bank&#8217;s Hadad to Head Financial Regulator &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia&#8217;s parliament approved Bank Indonesia Deputy
Governor Muliaman Hadad to head the board of a national
financial regulator due to start operating in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank may allow banks to own as much as
90 percent of commercial lenders, Hadad said in Jakarta today in
response to a question from reporters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approval would be &#8220;very selective,&#8221; he said. New
ownership rules will be announced before July, Hadad added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers chose Hadad over Achjar Iljas, who held a similar
position at the central bank a decade ago, after conducting so-
called fit-and-proper tests this month on the 14 people
nominated by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono for the seven
positions at the regulator. Hadad was chosen by acclamation,
rather than by vote, according to a notice posted in the meeting
room of Commission XI, which oversees financial institutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new regulator, known in the Indonesian language as
Otoritas Jasa Keuangan, or OJK, will supervise capital markets,
insurers, pension funds and other non-bank institutions next
year and oversee commercial lenders starting from January 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OJK will take over regulation of capital markets,
insurers and pension funds from the Capital Market and Financial
Institution Supervisory Board, and assume responsibility for
bank supervision, currently handled by the central bank. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;U.S. Consumer Bureau Aide Said to Be Tapped for General Counsel &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meredith Fuchs, chief of staff to Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau Director Richard Cordray, will be named
general counsel of the agency, replacing Leonard J. Kennedy,
according to a person briefed on the change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, a former general counsel of Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)
who joined the consumer bureau in January 2011, will become an
adviser to Cordray, said the person, speaking on condition of
anonymity because the decision isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jen Howard, a spokeswoman for the consumer bureau, declined
to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Lloyd Blankfein said Goldman
Sachs was doing &#8220;God&#8217;s work,&#8221; Calvin Trillin was inspired to
write a poem, including the lines: &#8220;The Lord has got this
itch/To see the Goldman Sachs folks filthy rich.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trillin is a long-time staff writer at the New Yorker and
also the Nation&#8217;s deadline poet. His best-selling books include
&#8220;About Alice.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &#8220;Quite Enough of Calvin Trillin: Forty Years of Funny
Stuff,&#8221; he picked out his favorite pieces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spoke over lunch at Bloomberg world headquarters in New
York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lundborg: You have a unique theory about what caused the
global financial meltdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trillin: An old Ivy League guy in a bar near Grand Central
explained that the meltdown was about smart people going to Wall
Street. In his day the lower third of the class went into
finance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were pleasant guys. They were well-dressed. They
weren&#8217;t even terribly greedy by today&#8217;s standards -- they wanted
a house in Greenwich with a big sail boat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, because of all of the money being made, the smart
kids, like 30 or 40 percent of the Harvard class, went either to
business school or directly to Wall Street. They&#8217;re the ones who
caused the trouble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Idea &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lundborg: How? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trillin: Our guys couldn&#8217;t have made up credit default
swaps. They couldn&#8217;t have done the math. They had no idea. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grandmother Judy Haussman is a
noisy, vulgar, pill-popping old hippie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In real life, she&#8217;d be the neighbor from hell. On stage,
she&#8217;s a blast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julie Walters (&#8220;Billy Elliot,&#8221; &#8220;Calendar Girls&#8221;) is a
vibrant, funny and infuriating Judy in &#8220;The Last of the
Haussmans,&#8221; a new play by Stephen Beresford at the National
Theatre in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Judy has a minor operation to remove a small cancerous
growth, her two children come to visit in her decrepit Art Deco
seaside house. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daughter Libby (Helen McCrory) is an uptight control freak
who wants to secure the potentially valuable property for
herself and her brother. Son Nick (Rory Kinnear) is a self-
loathing gay drug addict who can&#8217;t face conflict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beresford provides some juicy comic battles early in his
first play, and shows he&#8217;s not afraid to tackle big themes:
death, inheritance, family duty, love. An actor himself, he also
knows how to gift a good line to a great performer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judy, her straggly gray hair frizzing over her shoulders,
lights the stage. She struggles to remain true to her 1960s
ashram values as the world changes around her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The residents&#8217; association? They&#8217;re worse than the
Stasi,&#8221; she cries, flashing her private parts like a naughty
child. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Endless Battles &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the interval, Beresford&#8217;s authorial inexperience
shows. The battles become repetitive and rambling. The
inheritance plot sputters. Judy churns out the same sort of
speeches over and over. The 2-hour-and-45-minute running time
slows to the speed of a snail race. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could director Howard Davies not have loaned a pair of
scissors to the author? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designer Vicki Mortimer creates an impressively dilapidated
two-story house. It&#8217;s a colorful mess of old rugs, Indian bric-
a-brac and cheap furniture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks great, Walters is in top form, and there&#8217;s fine
subtle support from McCrory as a harsh-voiced Libby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating: ***. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Handsome Billy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Britten&#8217;s masterpiece, the 1951 &#8220;Billy Budd,&#8221; the
morally twisted John Claggart destroys the beautiful new recruit
Billy Budd on board a British man-of-war. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s ripe stuff, with arias full of tormented passion,
timber-shaking sailors&#8217; choruses and glittering orchestration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new production at English National Opera has many musical
merits. Matthew Rose is a subtle and seductive Claggart, and his
huge ringing voice gives promise of an exciting Wotan in the
future. Tenor Kim Begley has gravitas as the compromised Captain
Vere, and the chorus sounds explosively good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conductor Edward Gardner cooks up a storm in the pit when
needed and Benedict Nelson sings Billy attractively, even if he
lacks theatrical vibrancy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Alden&#8217;s production is yet another of the soul-sapping
stagings in which ENO specializes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The players in the drama seem to be gulag prisoners and
Soviet-era soldiers, a confusing choice for a naval drama. The
large rusty metal panels of Paul Steinberg&#8217;s set are neither
claustrophobic enough for the intimate scenes nor open enough
for the exciting sea chase in Act 2. Rating: **. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Theatrical Espionage &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Frayn&#8217;s 2003 play &#8220;Democracy,&#8221; now at the Old
Vic, deals with the West German chancellorship (1969-74) of
left-wing Willy Brandt. He was brought down by the revelation
that his close aide, Gunter Guillaume, was an East German spy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between the charismatic, depressive Brandt
(Patrick Drury) and the adoring Guillaume (who refers to himself
as Brandt&#8217;s &#8220;Sancho Panza&#8221;) is well handled, and the ironies
of their odd friendship explored with precision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s not enough to make a gripping piece. Frayn also
includes stodgy reams of exposition about the complicated
coalition politics of the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guillaume (the excellent Aidan McArdle in a terrible
wrinkly wig) frequently steps out of character to address the
audience or to talk to his spymaster at the side of the stage.
It&#8217;s an alienating dramatic technique that makes an already dry,
information-heavy piece feel even drier. Rating: **. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) may be developing
its own Windows Phone handsets, departing from its current
practice of working only with partners like Nokia Oyj, according
to Rick Sherlund, an analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company may be collaborating with a contract
manufacturer to build a phone, Sherlund wrote in a note today,
citing industry sources. Sherlund, who recommends buying the
shares, said he wasn&#8217;t sure if the device would be a reference
design for other companies to use as an example for Windows
Phone products, or a Microsoft-branded phone for consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the largest software maker, said yesterday that
smartphones with the new Windows Phone 8 program will go on sale
in the fall from Nokia, Huawei Technologies Co., HTC Corp. and
Samsung Electronics Co. The company didn&#8217;t mention plans for its
own phone. Microsoft needs to boost its share of the phone-
software market, which was 2.2 percent in the first quarter,
according to IDC, lagging behind Apple Inc. and Google Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We would not be surprised if MSFT were to decide to bring
their own handset to market next year given that MSFT has
decided to bring to market their own Windows 8 tablet/PC
products,&#8221; Sherlund wrote, using Microsoft&#8217;s stock ticker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft fell 2.6 percent to
$30.14 at the close in New York. The shares have gained 22
percent in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are big believers in our hardware partners and
together we&#8217;re focused on bringing Windows Phone 8 to the market
with them this year,&#8221; said Stacy Drake, a director in the
Windows Phone group, in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Surface Tablet &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google&#8217;s Android was the smartphone market leader in the
first quarter, with a 59 percent share, and Apple followed with
23 percent, IDC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 18, Microsoft said it will sell its own branded
tablet computer, called Surface, reversing its long-standing
strategy of relying exclusively on hardware partners in the
computer market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft last released a handset, the Kin, in 2010. The
device, targeted at teens and social-media enthusiasts, sold so
poorly that Microsoft ceased work on it after less than two
months in Verizon Wireless stores. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s second-best selling
drug, Lyrica, was approved by U.S. regulators today for use
against pain caused by spinal cord injuries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration cleared the expanded use
of Lyrica, already backed to treat nerve pain from fibromyalgia,
diabetic nerve pain and pain after shingles, New York-based
Pfizer, said today in a statement. Pfizer estimates a potential
patient population size of about 100,000 people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Until now, no FDA approved treatment options were
available in the U.S. for people with neuropathic pain
associated with spinal cord injury, a condition which can be
extremely disabling,&#8221; said Steven J. Romano, senior vice
president and head of Pfizer&#8217;s medicines development group,
Global Primary Care business unit, in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyrica is Pfizer&#8217;s best-selling drug after cholesterol pill
Lipitor, which lost patent protection in November. It had $3.39
billion in revenue last year. The treatment has patent
protection until 2018, and Pfizer is working to expand its use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer declined less than 1 percent to $22.60 at the close
in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Swiss National Bank&#8217;s ceiling on
the franc versus the euro is vulnerable because the sovereign
debt crisis may deepen, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co.
strategists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SNB&#8217;s foreign-exchange reserves surged to 70 percent of
Switzerland&#8217;s gross domestic product in May, more than the 56
percent level when the central bank abandoned its previous
currency-intervention policy in May 2010, analysts led by
Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note to clients today. They
recommended protecting against euro weakness via options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The merits of accruing so much exposure to the euro will
look increasingly suspect if the sovereign crisis intensifies
and euro-dollar collapses in a high-volatility fashion, thus
anchoring Swiss monetary policy to an imploding asset,&#8221; the
analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Swiss currency was little changed at 1.2011 per euro at
4:15 p.m. London time. The SNB has vowed to resolutely defend
the 1.20 francs-per-euro cap it established in September after
the euro-area debt crisis pushed the haven currency to a record
high of 1.008 per euro. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Total SA (FP), and
Melrose Resources Plc (MRS) are competing for a permit to explore for
natural gas in the deep waters of the Black Sea (BKSA) off the
Bulgarian coast as the country seeks to boost local output to
one third of consumption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The winner of the tender will be selected at the end of
July and the contract will be signed in September, allowing the
company to start work by the end of the year, Energy, Economy
and Tourism Minister Delyan Dobrev told reporters in the
Bulgarian capital Sofia today. The exploration permit for the
Khan Asparuh block near the northern border with Romania, is for
five years, including the initial drilling, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have high hopes to discover significant volumes of
natural gas in the Black Sea,&#8221; Dobrev said. Preliminary
estimates show there may be natural gas deposits of 40 billion
cubic meters to 80 billion cubic meters, which would cover
Bulgaria&#8217;s consumption for the next 15 years to 20 years, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Black Sea, which for 40 years divided the Soviet bloc
from U.S. ally Turkey, is now a frontier region, attracting
explorers from as far away as Brazil and Texas. The end of the
Cold War, combined with record-high energy prices and
technological advances, has led oil companies to reconsider its
deep, unexplored waters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Imports, Ban &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulgaria now imports most of its gas from Russia. It&#8217;s
seeking to diversify its supply sources after a price dispute
between Ukraine and Russia caused an interruption in shipments
for two weeks in 2009. OAO Gazprom (GAZP), Russia&#8217;s natural-gas export
monopoly, pumps 17.8 billion cubic meters a year to Turkey,
Greece and Macedonia via Bulgaria. About 3.5 billion cubic
meters of that is consumed by Bulgaria. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of locally produced natural gas is 40 percent
cheaper than Russian imports, Dobrev said. Edinburgh-based
Melrose Resources started in 2010 producing gas at three blocks
in Bulgaria&#8217;s Black Sea shelf near the Kaliakra cape that
contain an estimated 3 billion cubic meters of gas, which covers
20 percent of the country&#8217;s consumption over six years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year Melrose Resources produced 443 million cubic
meters of gas or 15 percent of consumption, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Direct Petroleum &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct Petroleum Exploration Inc., a Denver-based oil
producer, found a natural-gas deposit in Bulgaria estimated at 3
billion cubic meters, near the village of Deventsi close to the
northern city of Pleven, which will also provide about 15
percent of domestic consumption, Dobrev said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulgaria banned hydraulic fracturing and imposed a 100
million-lev ($65 million) fine for offenders, thwarting Chevron
Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s plans to explore for natural-gas deposits in the Balkan
country, which limits the country&#8217;s options to diversify
sources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work on an interconnecting pipeline with the natural-gas
grids of neighboring Romania will start in August, Dobrev said
and the link with Greece&#8217;s natural gas grid will be ready in
2015. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equity markets will probably climb 8
percent a year for the next decade, even though economic concern
will subdue returns in 2012, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s chief
U.S. equity strategist said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Near term, I think there&#8217;s more concern regarding many
asset classes -- equities in particular -- because of the issues
and the headwinds in terms of the economy, in terms of
valuation, in terms of modest earnings growth,&#8221; David Kostin
said in a Bloomberg Television interview today with Tom Keene
and Sara Eisen. &#8220;I think those are the issues that you&#8217;re
looking at now to the end of 2012. Longer term, statistically,
you should do OK.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kostin said negative earnings revisions at major companies
and U.S. economic stagnation will hold back stocks this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve officials yesterday predicted growth of 1.9
percent to 2.4 percent this year, down from their April forecast
of 2.4 percent to 2.9 percent. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said
the economy remained vulnerable to fiscal tightening and any
worsening of the euro area&#8217;s sovereign-debt crisis. The Federal
Open Market Committee, which has kept its benchmark interest
rate near zero since December 2008, reiterated yesterday that it
expects to keep rates &#8220;exceptionally low&#8221; at least through
late 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kostin said portfolio managers increasingly look at
dividends when investing in equities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The scarcest asset in the world is income right now,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;You have big increases coming in technology; they will
be the largest sector in terms of payers of dividends.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hedge fund run by a former
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) executive who helped create the credit-
derivatives market is aiding the lender as it unwinds trades in
an index at the heart of a loss of more than $2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlueMountain Capital Management LLC, co-founded by Andrew Feldstein, has been compiling trades in recent weeks that would
offset JPMorgan&#8217;s risk in Series 9 of the Markit CDX North
America Investment Grade Index, then selling the positions to
the bank, according to three people outside the firms who are
familiar with the strategy. That allowed the bank, which is said
to have amassed as much as $100 billion in bets on the index, to
unwind trades outside the traditional web of dealers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They used BlueMountain to disguise what they were
doing,&#8221; Peter Tchir, founder of New York-based macro advisory
firm TF Market Advisors, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;It all
gets a little bizarre and shows how screwy this whole market
is.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan tapped BlueMountain as a middleman after trades in
its London chief investment office grew so large that the bank
was creating price distortions that hedge funds sought to
exploit, said the market participants, who asked not to be
identified because they weren&#8217;t authorized to discuss the
trades. BlueMountain was one of the funds that benefited from
the price dislocations, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Signaling Unwinds &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doug Hesney, a spokesman for New York-based BlueMountain,
declined to comment, as did JPMorgan&#8217;s Kristin Lemkau. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading volumes in the past three weeks signal JPMorgan has
been unwinding its positions in the Markit CDX index known as
IG9, a credit-default swaps benchmark created in 2007 that&#8217;s
linked to the debt of 121 companies in the U.S. and Canada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A record $31 billion of IG9 index contracts expiring in
December 2017 traded June 19, up from a daily average of $2.4
billion in the previous three months, according to Markit Group
Ltd., which administers the index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trading surge in the contracts that fueled much of
JPMorgan&#8217;s loss follows a 35 percent reduction in the net amount
of protection that dealers sold on the index in the three weeks
ended June 15, data from the Depository Trust  Clearing Corp.
show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Strategy Backfires &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is seeking to stem the losses after its chief
investment office shifted its strategy of buying credit-default
swaps on corporate debt to protect the bank against a financial
crisis or deteriorating economy. At the start of the year, the
group was ordered to reduce its positions and instead executed a
series of trades that left the bank with even bigger and harder-
to-manage exposures, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon told
the Senate Banking Committee in Washington last week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Celebrities joined advocacy group
Greenpeace International in seeking a ban on oil drilling and
excessive fishing in Arctic waters that would scuttle plans by
Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and its Russian state-run rival OAO Rosneft to
extract petroleum there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul McCartney, boy band One Direction and entrepreneur
Richard Branson are among those named on a scroll calling for
the ban, Amsterdam-based Greenpeace said today during a press
conference at the UN&#8217;s Rio+20 Conference on Sustainable
Development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, Rosneft and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) are among
companies seeking to drill for oil in the Arctic, which is
estimated to hold 90 billion barrels of oil and 1,670 trillion
cubic feet of natural gas, according to the U.S. Geological
Survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It seems madness that we are willing to go to the ends of
the Earth to find the last drops of oil when our best scientific
minds are telling us we need to get off fossil fuels,&#8221;
McCartney in a statement. &#8220;We need to take a stand.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace intends to collect 1 million names for the
scroll, which will be planted on the seabed four kilometers (2.5
miles) below the ice at the North Pole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace activists occupied a Shell icebreaker in Finland
in May to protest the company&#8217;s plans to drill for oil off the
Alaska north coast. The company won U.S. Fish  Wildlife Service
authorization to disrupt animal habitats in the region this
month, moving it closer to starting drilling in the area this
year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) and other U.S. banks would be subject to Dodd-Frank
Act swaps rules in their overseas offices under guidance that
may be proposed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal for so-called interpretive guidance, scheduled
for a vote today at a CFTC meeting in Washington, has been
criticized by U.S. bankers who say it could put them at a
disadvantage to overseas competitors. The international reach of
clearing and trading regulations gained urgency after JPMorgan
disclosed at least $2 billion in losses on trades by the bank&#8217;s
chief investment office in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think if we were to leave the London branches of the
U.S. banks or even the guaranteed affiliates out, it would be,
so to speak, another loophole and a retreat from reform, where
risk would come crashing back to our taxpayers and our Federal
Reserve,&#8221; CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler testified to the House
Financial Services Committee lawmakers during a June 19 hearing
on the JPMorgan loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dodd-Frank, the financial-regulation overhaul enacted in
2010, was intended to reduce risk and increase transparency in
the $648 trillion over-the counter swaps market after largely
unregulated trades helped fuel the 2008 credit crisis. It
required swaps to be guaranteed by central clearinghouses that
stand between buyers and sellers, traded on public exchanges and
reported to swap-data repositories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Big Blowouts&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As Gensler points out: In all these big blowouts, you
have a global dimension,&#8221; James Angel, a finance professor at
Georgetown University&#8217;s business school in Washington, said in a
phone interview yesterday. &#8220;You can&#8217;t really blame a regulator
faced with this kind of mess wanting to have all the information
readily available.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley (MS) and other U.S.
banks have argued that applying Dodd-Frank to their overseas
operations would hurt their ability to compete with foreign-
based rivals that may face other requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If JPMorgan overseas operates under different rules than
our foreign competitors, we can no longer provide the best
products and services to our U.S. clients or our foreign
clients,&#8221; JPMorgan&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said
at the financial-services panel hearing on the losses. &#8220;The
rules at the transaction level about margin reporting, all those
requirements may enable Deutsche Bank to make the better deal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S.-based banks may be allowed to comply with the rules on
a timetable that&#8217;s similar to one facing their overseas rivals,
two people with knowledge of the guidance said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Timetable &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timetable under consideration by the CFTC would drop
earlier plans to give foreign-based banks more time to comply
with some regulations than overseas operations of U.S. banks,
the people said on condition of anonymity because the guidance
hasn&#8217;t yet been proposed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compliance schedule was the subject of negotiations
yesterday before the agency&#8217;s vote today. Steve Adamske, a CFTC
spokesman, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to requests for comment
outside of normal business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guidance, which has been the subject of internal debate
and disagreement at the agency during the last month, would be
open to public comment before it is completed. U.S.
Representatives Scott Garrett, a New Jersey Republican, and
Randy Neugebauer, a Texas Republican, sent Gensler a letter
yesterday urging the CFTC to adopt a form rule that includes an
analysis of the costs and benefits of the regulation instead of
informal guidance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We respectfully request that you do not move forward with
the non-binding &#8216;guidance&#8217; and instead proceed through a formal
rule-making process and conduct the appropriate cost-benefit
analysis that the law requires,&#8221; the lawmakers wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protalix BioTherapeutics Inc. (PLX) and
Pfizer Inc. (PFE) failed to win European Union backing for a medicine
to treat a rare genetic ailment because a competing treatment
from Shire Plc (SHP) has exclusive market rights for 10 years.
Protalix fell the most in more than six months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taliglucerase alfa shouldn&#8217;t be allowed on the market
because it works in the same way as Shire&#8217;s Vpriv, the European
Medicines Agency&#8217;s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human
Use said in a statement today. Medicines for rare diseases,
known as orphan drugs, are expensive to develop and have small
patient populations, so drugmakers are given exclusivity as an
incentive to develop them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;From a commercial standpoint, this is obviously a setback
that we will need to address,&#8221; Protalix Chief Executive Officer
David Aviezer said on a conference call with analysts. &#8220;We will
continue to do whatever we can to eventually try to reverse this
refusal.&#8221; Pfizer&#8217;s legal team is &#8220;looking into different
options,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision is a setback for Carmiel, Israel-based
Protalix, which won approval for the product from the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration on May 1 under the name Elelyso. The
treatment, Protalix&#8217;s first drug on the market, helped patients
with Gaucher disease in clinical trials, and side effects were
similar to those of other enzyme replacement therapies, the
London-based drug agency said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Missing Enzyme &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protalix&#8217;s U.S. shares fell 6.7 percent to $6.16 at 4 p.m.
in New York. The shares have gained 25 percent this year, giving
the company a market value of $566.1 million. Pfizer rose less
than 1 percent to $22.73. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug is a plant-based medicine that replaces an enzyme
missing in people with Gaucher disease, a genetic ailment that
affects as many as one in 50,000 people in the U.S., according
to the National Human Genome Research Institute. Sanofi (SAN) also
sells a drug for Gaucher called Cerezyme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaucher disease can cause fat to build up in the liver,
spleen, bone marrow and nervous system. About 1 in 14
individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry carries the mutated
gene that can cause the illness, and as many as 1 in 500 present
a form of the disorder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Positive Assessment&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While we are disappointed with the CHMP&#8217;s recommendation,
we are encouraged that the committee gave a positive risk-
benefit assessment,&#8221; Diem Nguyen, Pfizer&#8217;s general manager for
biosimilars, said in a statement. &#8220;The recommendation was based
solely on orphan market exclusivity and not the safety and
efficacy profile of taliglucerase alfa. Pfizer will continue to
work with relevant stakeholders to determine appropriate next
steps.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer unsuccessfully sought an exemption from the
exclusivity rule based on several factors, the company said.
There was no good evidence that Elelyso was clinically superior
to Vpriv, or that Vpriv was in short supply, both of which are
criteria for exemptions, the agency&#8217;s drug-review committee
found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Short Supply &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drugs for Gaucher and another illness, Fabry disease, have
been in short supply in the past couple of years because of a
2009 virus contamination at a Genzyme Corp. plant in Allston,
Massachusetts. Sanofi acquired Genzyme, the maker of Cerezyme,
last year, and has said production levels are increasing.
Protalix thought it could win an exemption for Elelyso because
of the shortages, CEO Aviezer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission usually adopts the committee&#8217;s
advice. Shire&#8217;s Vpriv was approved in Europe two years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, paid $60 million for
rights to sell taliglucerase and agreed to pay Protalix an
additional $55 million if the drug passed certain regulatory
hurdles, according to a December 2009 statement. New York-based
Pfizer is entitled to 60 percent of the drug&#8217;s revenue under the
agreement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) failed to
win the dismissal of a lawsuit brought by shareholders claiming
they were harmed by conflicts of interest related to
collateralized debt obligation transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Goldman
Sachs in April 2010, alleging fraud tied to CDOs that
contributed to the worst financial crisis since the Great
Depression. Goldman Sachs&#8217;s shares dropped about 13 percent
after the lawsuit was filed. The firm paid
$550 million to settle with the SEC, the largest penalty in the
regulator&#8217;s history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Paul A. Crotty in Manhattan ruled
yesterday that investors can proceed with a lawsuit alleging
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s stock plummeted because the bank failed to
disclose that it had bet against CDOs it sold to customers.
Crotty dismissed arguments that Goldman Sachs made material
misstatements or omissions regarding its receipt of warnings
from the SEC that the company might be sued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs created and sold CDOs linked to subprime
mortgages in early 2007, as the U.S. housing market faltered,
without disclosing that hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the
underlying securities and bet against one of the vehicles, known
as Abacus, according to an SEC lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman&#8217;s allegedly manipulative, deceitful, and
fraudulent conduct in hiding Paulson&#8217;s role and investment
position in Abacus transaction, and in hiding its own investment
position in Hudson, Anderson, and Timberwolf I transactions
takes plaintiffs&#8217; claim beyond that of mere mismanagement,&#8221;
Crotty said in his ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Securities
Litigation, 10-3461, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)&#8217;s handset revenue
estimates were cut by Nomura Holdings Inc. analysts after
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said the Finnish company&#8217;s current Lumia phones
won&#8217;t be supported by its upcoming mobile operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia&#8217;s revenue from Internet-surfing devices like the
Lumia 900 will be 6 billion euros ($7.5 billion) next year,
compared with an earlier estimate of 10.9 billion euros, Nomura
analysts led by Stuart Jeffrey wrote in a note today. The
company will sell 34 million devices running Windows Phone in
2013, 41 percent less than previously estimated, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the largest software maker, said this week its
Windows Phone 8 program will go on sale in the second half of
this year and that phones running previous versions can&#8217;t be
upgraded. Nokia Chief Executive Officer Stephen Elop, a former
Microsoft executive, has placed Nokia&#8217;s bets on Windows Phone
while abandoning its in-house Symbian operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We had hoped that Q3 would represent the low point in
Nokia&#8217;s competitive cycle,&#8221; the analysts wrote. &#8220;An abandoned
strategy in feature phones combined with an apparent increase in
competitive pressures in Windows Phone lead us to cut revenue
estimates that the recent restructuring announcement does not
fully offset.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lumia Owners &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who own a current-generation Lumia will be able to
upgrade to Windows Phone 7.8, featuring a new home screen, Doug
Dawson, a Nokia spokesman, said by e-mail. Clients will also
receive updates including functions like streaming of media
content, the ability to connect other devices to the Internet
through the handsets and new games from Zynga Inc. (ZNGA) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft may also be developing its own Windows Phone
handsets, departing from its current practice of working only
with partners like Espoo, Finland-based Nokia, according to
Nomura analyst Rick Sherlund. Nomura today cut its share-price
estimate on Nokia to 2 euros from 3.20 euros while maintaining a
neutral recommendation on the shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia fell 1.6 percent to 1.93 euros yesterday in Helsinki,
extending the stock&#8217;s drop this year to 49 percent. Finland&#8217;s
stock market is closed today for a holiday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company cut its earnings forecast last week for the
second time this year and said it will eliminate as many as
10,000 jobs and shut production and research sites as phone
sales continued to slump. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil (XOM) Corp.&#8217;s refinery in
Beaumont, Texas, flared nitric oxide at 8:30 p.m. local time

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) agreed to buy
corporate social-network operator Yammer Inc. for $1.2 billion
in cash to help it woo businesses with Facebook-like tools that
help employees collaborate in the workplace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Francisco-based Yammer will become part of Microsoft&#8217;s
Office division and the team will continue to report to current
Yammer Chief Executive Officer David Sacks, the companies said
today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yammer provides features -- similar to those found on
Facebook Inc. (FB) -- to more than 200,000 companies such as Ford
Motor Co. and EBay Inc. (EBAY) The purchase will help Microsoft compete
with corporate-social features like Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM)&#8217;s
Chatter product, as well as startups such as Jive Software Inc. (JIVE)
and Asana Inc., run by Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;ve been behind in terms of social, and this puts
them in a really strong position, perhaps even the lead,&#8221; said
Rob Koplowitz, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc. (FORR) &#8220;There are
a lot of communications that are being generated by social.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yammer was founded in 2008 by Sacks, the former chief
operating officer at PayPal Inc., and Adam Pisoni, who currently
serves as chief technology officer. It has raised more than $140
million in funding from venture firms, including Charles River
Ventures Inc. and Emergence Capital Partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Office, SharePoint &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, will add Yammer&#8217;s
corporate-social networking tools to its Office and SharePoint
software products for businesses. Large information-technology
companies are snapping up nimbler startups, sometimes before
they reach an initial public offering, spending $17.4 billion on
enterprise software acquisitions in 2011, compared with $715.5
million in 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides integrating Yammer into existing products,
Microsoft will continue to offer it as a standalone service,
Office Division President Kurt DelBene said on a conference
call. The deal is likely to be completed in the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While DelBene couldn&#8217;t say when Yammer features would
appear in Microsoft&#8217;s Office 365 cloud-based applications or in
SharePoint, he said that the cloud apps get updated quarterly,
or even monthly in some cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yammer works with Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPhone and Google Inc.&#8217;s
Android and that will continue under Microsoft, the companies
said. The software gives companies a private way to help
employees communicate. For example, supermarket chain Supervalu
Inc. (SVU) uses it to let sales people talk and share ideas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sacks will become a vice president in the Office division.
Yammer will keep its San Francisco office and employees, he said
in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sacks &#8216;Committed&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Both I and my co-founder are committed to staying at the
new company and continuing to run Yammer for a long time to
come,&#8221; Sacks said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yammer was advised by Frank Quattrone&#8217;s Qatalyst Partners
LLC, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, who
asked not to be identified because the information hasn&#8217;t been
made public. Business Insider previously reported Qatalyst&#8217;s
involvement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Yammer deal follows other recent enterprise-software
purchases centered on social media. Salesforce.com will gain
social-marketing tools through its $745 million agreement to
purchase Buddy Media Inc. earlier this month, and Oracle Corp. (ORCL)
recently announced plans to buy two companies that analyze data
on social-media sites. Those are Vitrue Inc. and Collective
Intellect Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares fell 2.7 percent to $29.87 at the close in
New York. The stock has gained 15 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Bristol-Myers Squibb
Co. (BMY) failed to gain approval of their top experimental drug, the
blood thinner Eliquis, from U.S. regulators who said they needed
more data on the treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration wants clarification of
information from already completed trials, and isn&#8217;t seeking new
studies, the companies said in a statement. The drug, aimed at
patients with heart arrhythmia, would have $2.5 billion a year
in sales by 2015 if approved, according to Tim Anderson, a
Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. analyst in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eliquis is among experimental products the two New York-
based companies were depending on to replace sales from best-
selling drugs that have lost patent protection in the last year.
An FDA response could take six months after the requested data
is supplied, said Laura Hortas, a Bristol-Myers spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are already working with the agency, and we are
hopeful that the review of our submission can be completed
within a shorter time frame,&#8221; Hortas said in an e-mailed
response to questions. The FDA&#8217;s response &#8220;does not alter our
confidence in the therapeutic profile of Eliquis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares fell 1.1 percent to $22.47 at 4 p.m. New York
time. Bristol-Myers shares dropped 3.5 percent to $34.13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Competing Products &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson  Johnson (JNJ), of New Brunswick, New Jersey, and
Leverkusen, Germany-based Bayer AG have a competing pill,
Xarelto, as does Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, of Ingelheim,
Germany. Bayer rose less than 1 percent to 52.97 euros in
Frankfurt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Pfizer&#8217;s cholesterol pill Lipitor, with $12.9 billion
in peak yearly sales, and Bristol&#8217;s blood-thinner Plavix, with
$7.09 billion in revenue, lost patent protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a delay but it shouldn&#8217;t impact the longer term
profile of the product,&#8221; said Marshall Gordon, an investor with
Clearbridge Advisors in New York, in a telephone interview.
&#8220;It&#8217;ll still have a best-in class profile.&#8221; His fund owns
shares of both companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst with ISI Group, said the FDA
was likely looking to make sure data in one of the clinical
trials was accurate about how many strokes and bleeding episodes
patients on the drugs had. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Although this is a material time delay, we don&#8217;t see an
impact to our conclusion that Eliquis will eventually dominate
the blood thinner space,&#8221; he said in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies had been planning to launch promotion of the
pill after what had been an expected approval this month, Hortas
said. A six month delay would push that launch into 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eliquis is one of three drugs Pfizer had been expecting to
help replace revenue lost from Lipitor.  The company is awaiting
FDA approval of its arthritis pill tofacitinib, which won the
backing of U.S. regulatory advisers last month. Pfizer plans to
release data on its experimental Alzheimer&#8217;s treatment
bapineuzumab at a medical meeting in October. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. hired Diego De Giorgi, chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s
investment banking division, as co-head of its European
securities operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De Giorgi will become joint head of global corporate and
investment banking for Europe with Bob Elfring, Christian Meissner, Bank of America&#8217;s head of global corporate and
investment banking, wrote in a memo to employees today. Elfring
joined the firm last year as head of the securities unit in
Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Northern Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two &#8220;will partner closely together to drive the growth
of our corporate and investment banking franchise,&#8221; Meissner
said in the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meissner, who is moving to the U.S. as Bank of America&#8217;s
sole head of global investment banking, is seeking to bolster
his team in Europe following the departures of Andrea Orcel, who
had been chairman of global banking and markets, and Jonathan Moulds, the firm&#8217;s former president of Europe. He hired Alex Wilmot-Sitwell from UBS AG in April to be president of its
European division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De Giorgi, who has previously overseen teams at Goldman
Sachs responsible for equity capital markets and clients in the
financial-services industry, declined to comment by e-mail
earlier today. De Giorgi and Elfring will report to Meissner and
Wilmot-Sitwell, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America is the 11th-ranked adviser on mergers
involving companies in Western Europe this year, down from 10th
place in the first half of last year, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The bank has also slipped in equity underwriting and ranks
fifth in Europe, the Middle East and Africa this year, down from
third, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs ranks second in Western European merger
advice this year behind Deutsche Bank AG, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nokia Oyj (NOK1V), the Finnish smartphone
maker using Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s operating system, fell to a 16-
year low after analysts said sales may be hurt as the U.S.
supplier&#8217;s new program won&#8217;t work on its current phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia dropped 11.4 percent to 1.71 euros in Helsinki, the
lowest since August 1996. The stock has lost more than half of
its value this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the largest software maker, said on June 20 that
its Windows Phone 8 program will go on sale in the second half
and that phones running previous versions can&#8217;t be upgraded. The
move may make Nokia&#8217;s current models less attractive, hurting a
company already grappling with mounting losses and highlighting
its dependence on Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What happens with Microsoft is crucial for Nokia as it
tries to control its cash burn,&#8221; said Michiel Plakman, a fund
manager at Robeco Group in Rotterdam, who helps manage about 9
billion euros ($11.2 billion) including Microsoft shares. &#8220;The
problem for Nokia, as it&#8217;s been in the last couple years, is
that there&#8217;s no plan B.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plakman said he sold Nokia shares before the company&#8217;s
agreement with Microsoft last year. Nokia Chief Executive
Officer Stephen Elop, a former Microsoft executive, placed
Nokia&#8217;s bets on Windows Phone while abandoning its in-house
Symbian operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Legacy Products&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stuart Jeffrey, a New York-based analyst at Nomura Holdings
Inc., lowered his revenue estimate on June 22 for Espoo,
Finland-based Nokia, citing the new Microsoft product. The
Helsinki stock exchange was closed for a holiday on June 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia may sell fewer of its Lumia phones that run Windows
Phone in the third quarter than previously estimated because
some customers will wait until the Windows Phone 8 release
before buying a new device, Jeff Kvaal and Andrew Gardiner,
analysts at Barclays Capital, said in a note June 21. Current
Lumia devices are &#8220;somehow already legacy products,&#8221; the
analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who own a current-generation Lumia will be able to
upgrade to Windows Phone 7.8, featuring a new home screen, Doug
Dawson, a Nokia spokesman, said on June 22. Clients will also
receive updates including functions like streaming of media
content, the ability to connect other devices to the Internet
through the handsets and new games from Zynga Inc. (ZNGA) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung Electronics Co., which overtook Nokia in the first
quarter as the world&#8217;s largest handset maker, said today its
Galaxy S III will help mobile earnings surpass the first-quarter
record after users responded more positively to the latest
smartphone model. The Galaxy model line runs on Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s
Android operating system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL), maker of the iPad and
iPhone, patented a technology intended to protect Internet users
from data surveillance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patent 8,205,265, issued June 19, covers a technique
involving a cloned identity with interests that diverge from
that of the user. Actions performed by the clone will appear to
&#8220;network eavesdroppers&#8221; to have been the user&#8217;s, according to
the patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clone&#8217;s actions are &#8220;are designed to pollute
electronic profiling or dataveillance,&#8221; Apple said in the
patent. The cloned identity system can include confidential
information that, while appearing to be legitimate, isn&#8217;t
connected to the user. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of fake confidential information the clone would
use include phone numbers, credit card numbers and e-mail
accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple, based in Cupertino, California, applied for the
patent in October with assistance from Schwegman, Lundberg 
Woessner PA of Minneapolis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Patents &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple&#8217;s Bid to Bar Samsung Galaxy Tab U.S. Sales Set for Hearing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple&#8217;s request for a court order blocking U.S. sales of
Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)&#8217;s Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet computer is
scheduled for a court hearing this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Lucy H. Koh in San Jose, California,
said she also hopes to rule on Apple&#8217;s request to block sales of
Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy Nexus smartphone before the June 29 hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s two biggest makers of high-end phones have
accused each other of copying designs and technology for mobile
devices and are fighting patent battles in four continents to
retain their dominance in the $219 billion global smartphone
market. The June 29 hearing will address Apple&#8217;s third request
to block sales of Samsung&#8217;s tablet computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 4, Koh rejected Apple&#8217;s second request to ban the
tablet sales while the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit in Washington was considering her first such denial in
December. Koh said then she didn&#8217;t have jurisdiction to issue a
preliminary injunction because the appeals court hadn&#8217;t issued a
mandate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 19, the appeals court reaffirmed its May
determination that Apple&#8217;s patent on a design of the tablet is
likely to withstand challenges to its validity. That decision
allowed the Cupertino, California-based company to renew its
request to block sales of Samsung&#8217;s tablet in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harold McElhinny, a lawyer for Apple, told Koh June 21 that
the appeals court mandate was issued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koh&#8217;s comments about the June 29 hearing and her pending
ruling on the Nexus smartphone came at the conclusion of a
hearing in which both companies sought pretrial rulings to
streamline their cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge said she was unlikely to rule in favor of either
side on their requests. She told the companies to narrow their
claims in the litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung on June 21 began rolling out its Galaxy S III
flagship smartphone in the U.S. through T-Mobile USA Inc. The
touch-screen device will be available from the three other
largest U.S. carriers -- Verizon Wireless, ATT Inc. (T) and Sprint
Nextel Corp. (S) -- in the coming weeks, the Suwon, South Korean-
based company said in a statement last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple, anticipating sales of the new phone, told Koh at a
previous hearing it was considering filing a request for a
temporary restraining order blocking the Galaxy S III before its
release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple dropped its request for a restraining order when Koh
said it might delay a July 30 trial date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., 11-
cv-1846, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
(San Jose). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Braves in Settlement Talks With Disney over &#8216;Brave&#8217; Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atlanta National League Baseball Club Inc., owner of the
Atlanta Braves baseball team, is in settlement talks with Walt
Disney Co. (DIS) over a disputed trademark registration, according to
a filing with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s film &#8220;Brave,&#8221; about a red-headed female archer
in a fantasy kingdom in Scotland, was released in the U.S. this
month. In anticipation of merchandise opportunities connected to
the film, Disney filed 14 applications to register &#8220;Brave&#8221; as
a trademark for a wide range of goods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The baseball team objected to Disney&#8217;s attempt to register
the mark for use with a variety of food items, including ice
cream, frozen yogurt, snack foods, meat, poultry and processed
fruits and vegetables. The team sells food products at its
ballpark and said consumers might be confused about the source
of &#8220;Brave&#8221; branded food products Disney might sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a June 12 filing, counsel for the team asked that its
opposition proceedings at the patent office be suspended until
Aug. 11 because the parties are engaged in settlement talks.
Disney&#8217;s in-house counsel has given the team&#8217;s in-house lawyer
comments regarding a few remaining issues related to a draft
agreement between the team and the Burbank, California-based
company, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to patent office records, the team is represented
by Mary L. Kelvin, Richard S. Mandel, Elise Cassell and Seth
Shaifer of New York&#8217;s Cowan Liebowitz  Latman PC. Disney is
represented by David M. Kelly, Monica Riva Talley, Julia Anne
Matheson, Linda K. McLeod, Lynn M. Jordan, Anne C. Bonny and
Mary Beth Walker of Washington-based Finnegan, Henderson,
Farabow, Garrett  Dunner LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Before
the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, 91204352. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;USOC Apologizes to Knitters for Cease-and-Desist Letter &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Olympic Committee has sent an apology letter to
the 2 million members of a social network devoted to knitting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a June 21 statement, USOC spokesman Patrick Sandusky
said that the committee regretted the use of &#8220;insensitive
terms&#8221; in a cease-and-desist letter objecting to Ravelry.com&#8217;s
&#8220;Ravelympics&#8221; knitting competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter, which was posted on Ravelry.com&#8217;s website June
20, demanded that the name of &#8220;Ravelympics&#8221; be changed, and
said the use of the name is &#8220;disrespectful to our country&#8217;s
finest athletes and fails to recognize or appreciate their hard
work.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the letter demanded the removal of Olympic
symbols in patterns and projects, and the word &#8220;Olympics&#8221; from
the name of other patterns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter generated protests from knitters who posted
statements on the USOC&#8217;s Facebook page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the statement, Sandusky thanked &#8220;all of you who have
posted, tweeted, e-mailed and called regarding the letter sent
to the organizers of the Ravelympics.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the letter was a standard-form cease-and-desist
letter, and the committee &#8220;never intended to make this a
personal attack on the knitting community or to suggest that
knitters are not supportive of Team USA.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To show the USOC&#8217;s support of the Ravelry community,
Sandusky said the committee would &#8220;welcome any handmade items
that you would like to create to travel with, and motivate our
team at the 2012 games.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One knitter responded to that request on the committee&#8217;s
Facebook page by saying, &#8220;You want our stuff for free? We make
hats, scarves and socks for soldiers in Afghanistan, caps for
premature babies and cancer patients, blankets for people who&#8217;ve
lost everything to a flood, fire or tornado. You sir, get
nothing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The social network still may comply with the USOC&#8217;s demand.
A June 20 posting on the Ravelry.com website says, &#8220;it&#8217;s
looking like we may have to rename the Ravelympics. They&#8217;ve made
the suggestion of &#8216;Ravelry Games.&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Black Keys Rock Duo Sues Pizza Hut, Home Depot Over Songs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Black Keys sued Home Depot Inc. (HD) and Yum Brands Inc. (YUM)&#8217;s
Pizza Hut, alleging the companies used the rock duo&#8217;s songs in
commercials without authorization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick Carney and Daniel Auerbach, known as the Black
Keys, sued Home Depot for the unauthorized use of &#8220;Lonely
Boy,&#8221; and sued Pizza Hut and its advertising company,
Interpublic Group of Cos., over &#8220;Gold on the Ceiling,&#8221; in
separate filings June 21 in federal court in Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group said Pizza Hut and its ad agency created a
commercial for a product called Cheesy Bites Pizza that
&#8220;prominently features significant portions&#8221; of &#8220;Gold on the
Ceiling.&#8221; Home Depot ran a commercial for its Ryobi brand of
power tools that uses parts of &#8220;Lonely Boy,&#8221; the band said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of the songs was &#8220;a brazen and improper effort to
capitalize on plaintiffs&#8217; hard-earned success,&#8221; lawyers for the
Black Keys said in the complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We haven&#8217;t seen the complaint but we take intellectual
property very seriously,&#8221; Stephen Holmes, a spokesman for
Atlanta-based Home Depot, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Fuller, a spokesman for Louisville, Kentucky-based
Yum Brands, referred a request for comment to Pizza Hut&#8217;s ad
firm, the Martin Agency, a unit of Interpublic. Dean Jarrett of
Richmond, Virginia-based Martin had no immediate comment. Tom
Cunningham, a spokesman for New York-based Interpublic, didn&#8217;t
immediately return messages seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The band said in the lawsuits that letters were sent to
Pizza Hut and Home Depot in May requesting that they stop
showing the ads with the music. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Lonely Boy&#8221; and &#8220;Gold on the Ceiling&#8221; are the first
two singles from the Black Keys&#8217; seventh album, &#8220;El Camino,&#8221;
released in December on Nonesuch Records, a division of Warner
Music Group. According to the complaint, &#8220;El Camino&#8221; has sold
more than 800,000 copies so far. Auerbach plays guitars and
Carney drums. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also suing the companies is co-writer Brian Burton, known
professionally as Danger Mouse. The plaintiffs asked for jury
trials of the copyright-infringement suits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case are Auerbach v. Pizza Hut, 12-05385, and Auerbach
v. Home Depot, 2:12-cv-05386, U.S. District Court, Central
District of California (Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Liberty Media Says File-Hosting Company Infringes Adult Films &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liberty Media Holdings LLC, a Las Vegas-based maker of
adult films, sued a file-hosting company for copyright
infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint filed June 20 in federal court
in Las Vegas, FF Magnat Ltd.&#8217;s Oron hosting service is accused
of aiding infringement of Liberty&#8217;s Corbin Fisher films. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The storage company &#8220;is cognizant of its role as the
vehicle in which infringers act in concert with one another to
copy and distribute huge amounts of infringing material,&#8221;
according to the complaint. Oron is the 935th-most visited
Internet site, Liberty claims, citing Alexas.com, a website that
monitors web traffic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liberty asked the court to bar Oron and 500 unidentified
defendants from copying and posting its content without
authorization. It also seeks a court order for the impoundment
of all of its content in the defendants&#8217; possession, and awards
of money damages and litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oron didn&#8217;t respond immediately to an e-mailed request for
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liberty is represented by James M. DeVoy and Marc J.
Randazza of the Randazza Legal Group of Las Vegas and Ronald D. Green Jr. of New York&#8217;s Greenberg Traurig LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Liberty Media Holdings LLC v. FF Magnat Ltd.,
12-cv-01057, U.S. District Court, District of Nevada (Las
Vegas). &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Zachary R. Mider and Jeffrey McCracken" date="Jun 25, 2012 12:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-25/jpmorgan-shuns-chesapeake-business-that-goldman-courts.html"><headline>JPMorgan Shuns Chesapeake Business That Goldman Courts</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) compete for banking and trading business from
almost all of the world&#8217;s largest companies, with one notable
exception: Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK), the second biggest U.S. gas
producer now facing a cash-flow shortage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more than a decade, JPMorgan bankers have declined to
do business with Chesapeake and its chief executive officer,
Aubrey McClendon, 52, said people with knowledge of the matter.
In contrast, Goldman Sachs, which once loaned money to McClendon
against his wine collection, recently helped arrange a $4
billion loan for Oklahoma City-based Chesapeake and is advising
on its efforts to sell assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. lender by assets, is missing out
on a shot at hundreds of millions of dollars in fees paid to
banks over the years by Chesapeake, one of the energy industry&#8217;s
most active dealmakers. Avoiding Chesapeake also limits
JPMorgan&#8217;s risk should the gas company&#8217;s finances worsen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s unusual to choose not to do any business with an
organization that buys a lot of banking services,&#8221; said Douglas Elliott, a fellow in economic studies at the Washington-based
Brookings Institution and a former investment banker. &#8220;If
anything, there&#8217;s a tendency to be greedy and want the fees.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerns about Chesapeake&#8217;s fast growth and credit quality
played a role in JPMorgan&#8217;s decision not to pursue business from
the energy firm, said the people, who asked not to be identified
because the discussions were private. Competition is already
fierce and other banks have an edge, reducing the attractiveness
of pursuing Chesapeake work, one person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials at Chesapeake and New York-based JPMorgan
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Reckless Billionaire&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McClendon is known as one of the energy industry&#8217;s biggest
risk-takers. Forbes magazine last year called him &#8220;America&#8217;s
most reckless billionaire.&#8221; He founded the company in 1989,
going on buying sprees that eventually amounted to a portfolio
of oil and gas fields that covers an area half the size of New
York State. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way, McClendon has outspent cash flow in 19 of 21
years, relying on asset sales or financing transactions to stay
afloat. That has sometimes left the company, with unsecured debt
rated as junk by Standard  Poor&#8217;s and Moody&#8217;s Investors
Service, exposed to swings in oil and gas prices. Beset by low
oil prices, the company put itself up for sale in 1998, failing
to secure a buyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the last pieces of investment-banking work that
JPMorgan, then known as J.P. Morgan  Co., did with Chesapeake
was a 1996 stock offering, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bear Stearns &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, McClendon asked JPMorgan to renew the relationship
after the bank bought Bear Stearns Cos. Bear was a frequent
participant in Chesapeake bond and stock offerings, some of
which JPMorgan completed after the purchase, said a person with
knowledge of the deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Black, then co-CEO of JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bank,
and Douglas Petno, head of JPMorgan&#8217;s natural-resources
investment banking group, met with McClendon to discuss the
matter, the people said. The practice remained in place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other senior managers involved in the decision included
Kelly Coffey, who ran corporate derivatives marketing and the
North American reputational risk committee; Stephen Eichenberger, a credit-risk executive, and Larry Landry, a
leveraged-finance banker, the people said. All five didn&#8217;t
respond to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chesapeake&#8217;s Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This group of JPMorgan officials and others inside the bank
met repeatedly to discuss Chesapeake&#8217;s growth, its credit
quality and the proper value of its holdings. One view of the
executives was that Chesapeake&#8217;s assets, including pipelines and
real estate, were strong yet might not provide enough collateral
if the company was forced to sell assets later, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one meeting of JPMorgan executives in 2008, it was
decided that Chesapeake didn&#8217;t meet at least portions of the
bank&#8217;s so-called five P&#8217;s of lending: people, payment,
protection, purpose and perspective, the people said. Those five
P&#8217;s, which other banks often call the five C&#8217;s -- character,
capacity, collateral, capital, conditions -- are used to examine
whether a borrower is creditworthy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan never found evidence of wrongdoing at Chesapeake,
the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s position is more of an understanding among its
staffers than a formal policy, said people familiar with the
situation. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56, was aware of
the practice while not involved in making the decision, one
person said. The stance on Chesapeake applies across all of
JPMorgan&#8217;s units, including lending, credit-derivatives and
merger-and-acquisitions, said people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Avoided Meetings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junior bankers in the oil and gas investment-banking group
are told not to seek meetings with Chesapeake executives to
pitch JPMorgan&#8217;s services, as they would most other energy firms
of Chesapeake&#8217;s size, people familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks occasionally will reject a potential client, said
Bradley Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. and a
former chief financial officer at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s tough to do, because the pressure on these banks is
to go out and bring in deals,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s usually a senior
person making that decision.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chesapeake is a gusher for investment banks. It issued
additional stock 13 times since its initial public offering in
1993, generating at least $265 million in fees, and it had 14
bond issues outstanding as of Dec. 31. It&#8217;s also the most
acquisitive company in the U.S. oil and gas exploration and
production industry, with 35 deals in the past 10 years valued
at $9.2 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Under Pressure &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, there will be more business. McClendon is facing
natural gas prices near historic lows, and is under pressure to
sell billions of dollars of assets to meet obligations. The
company&#8217;s cash-flow shortfall could reach $22 billion by next
year, according to James Sullivan, an analyst at New York-based
Alembic Global Advisors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&#8217;s also contending with a governance crisis. Shareholders
including billionaire Carl Icahn replaced a majority of the
board and stripped McClendon of his role as chairman after
Reuters reported in April that he had borrowed against personal
stakes in company wells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chesapeake does business with most Wall Street players,
including Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF), its closest adviser, Morgan
Stanley (MS), Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Citigroup Inc. (C) and Credit Suisse
Group AG. (CSGN) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goldman&#8217;s Work &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has developed a tight relationship with
Chesapeake, working with the company since at least 2005, when
it helped with a $262 million stock offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the recent loan and the asset-sale talks,
Goldman Sachs also won major roles in the planned initial public
offerings of Chesapeake&#8217;s oilfield-services subsidiary and FTS
International, a pressure-pumping business 30 percent owned by
Chesapeake. In 2009, a Goldman Sachs debt fund helped finance a
private-equity firm that bought rights to future oil and gas
production from some Chesapeake wells for $412 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chesapeake is a long-standing Goldman Sachs client and
the company and its board recently turned to us for both advice
and capital,&#8221; said Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-
based Goldman Sachs. &#8220;We&#8217;re proud Chesapeake chose us and our
involvement is consistent with our focus on helping our clients
with their particular needs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs connection extends to McClendon&#8217;s
personal wealth. In 2008, the firm filed a notice that it had
extended credit to McClendon against his wine collection, at one
point considered among the biggest in the U.S. Construction of a
$3 million, 31,000-square-foot warehouse to maintain the
collection was halted around the same time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs helped McClendon liquidate his personal
holdings in Chesapeake stock later that year when he sold his
stake to meet margin calls, according to a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Banking in many ways is still a trust business,&#8221; said
Elliott of the Brookings Institution. &#8220;Different people form

&lt;p&gt;California-blend gasoline gained for
a fifth day after a boiler breakdown at Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s
Torrance refinery was said to shut process units and a sulfur
unit at Phillips 66 (PSX)&#8217;s Los Angeles plant was said to lose power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A feedwater pump failure caused a boiler upset at the
150,000-barrel-a-day Torrance refinery in Southern California,
cutting off steam to units, three people familiar with the
situation said earlier today. Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, was
trying to start the units forced shut, said the people who asked
not to be named because the information isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gesuina Paras, an Exxon spokeswoman in Torrance, said in an
e-mail that a breakdown in one of the units at the refinery
caused the plant to flare gases at about 3:41 a.m. local time.
The incident was expected to have &#8220;minimal impact to
production,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in Los Angeles jumped
5 cents to 18.5 cents a gallon above futures traded on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That&#8217;s the highest premium for the fuel since May 29. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phillips 66&#8217;s 139,000-barrel-a-day Los Angeles refinery
restored service to a sulfur recovery unit that lost power
earlier today, a person with direct knowledge of the plant&#8217;s
operations said. The electrical failure was isolated, only
affecting the sulfur plant, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Francisco Carbob strengthened 5.5 cents to trade even
with Los Angeles at 18.5 cents a gallon above futures, its
highest premium since May 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend, or CARB, diesel in Los Angeles was
unchanged at a premium of 4.38 cents a gallon against Nymex
heating oil futures. San Francisco CARB diesel slipped 0.88 cent
to 3.25 cents a gallon above futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
Portland, Oregon, widened 1 cent to a 6-cent-a-gallon discount
versus gasoline futures. Low-sulfur diesel in Portland fell 1
cent to 14 cents a gallon over heating oil futures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jive Software Inc. (JIVE) Chief Executive
Officer Tony Zingale said the number of calls he&#8217;s received from
concerned Yammer Inc. customers has picked up in the two weeks
since reports surfaced that Microsoft (MSFT) Corp. would buy his rival. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Yammer, Jive provides social-networking software for
businesses, helping employees communicate with one another and
collaborate on projects. Jive is older, bigger and still
independent, while Yammer is now plagued by Microsoft&#8217;s struggle
to build social products, Zingale said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said yesterday that it&#8217;s buying Yammer for $1.2
billion, 12 days after Bloomberg News and other outlets reported
that an agreement was in the works. Zingale said the pace of
inquiries from Yammer clients has increased as details of the
Microsoft deal have been publicized. He&#8217;s now considering ways
to capitalize on that interest by possibly offering incentives
for Yammer users to make the switch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Clearly if the momentum in these kinds of calls pick up,
we&#8217;ll structure something formally and offer it publicly to
Yammer customers,&#8221; Zingale said. &#8220;Not everybody is a huge
Microsoft fan.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jive rose 6 percent to $20.93 at the close in New York,
valuing the Palo Alto, California-based company at $1.29
billion, just above what Microsoft is paying for Yammer. Jive
has jumped 74 percent since the 11-year-old company sold shares
to the public in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Joining Office &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yammer, based in San Francisco, will join Microsoft&#8217;s
Office division, with its corporate micro-blogging tools being
added to the SharePoint, Office 365 and Skype products. The
Office division will report to Yammer CEO David Sacks, who
founded the startup in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are not surprised that competitors are taking note of
the deal because it offers greater choice and flexibility,&#8221;
said Rich Adolph, a Microsoft spokesman. &#8220;Initial feedback from
our customers has been enthusiastic.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yammer&#8217;s more than 200,000 customers include Ford Motor
Co. (F), EBay Inc. and LG Electronics Inc. The bulk of its clients
use a free product, with 19 percent paying for the premium
version, according to a May 14 report from BMO Capital Markets,
comparing Jive and Yammer. Jive said in May that first-quarter
revenue climbed 58 percent to $25.3 million, which is more than
Yammer&#8217;s annual sales, BMO estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Jive and Yammer are at very different points in their
evolution,&#8221; Karl Keirstead, a BMO analyst, wrote in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Zingale acknowledges that the acquisition may cause
some prospective Jive customers to hold off until they see how
Microsoft integrates Yammer. While Jive&#8217;s product works with
SharePoint, there may be some people &#8220;hoping that Yammer-
SharePoint might deliver something down the road,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, rose less than 1
percent to $30.02. The stock has gained 24 percent in the past
year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC), the third-
largest U.S. independent oil and natural-gas producer by market
value, is in negotiations to bring Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) into its
deep-water Phobos project in the Gulf of Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon may cover Anadarko&#8217;s costs for the project&#8217;s first
exploration well, John Colglazier, vice president of investor
relations and communications at Anadarko, said during a Global
Hunter Securities LLC conference webcast today. The Woodlands,
Texas-based Anadarko would reduce its stake to 30 percent and
remain operator under the potential arrangement, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anadarko has a 50 percent working interest in Phobos along
with Plains Exploration  Production Co., John Christiansen, an
Anadarko spokesman, said in a telephone interview today. Plains
expects a resource potential of 306 million barrels of oil
equivalent from Phobos, it said in slides at the Global Hunter
conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick McGinn, an Exxon spokesman, declined to comment,
saying in an e-mail that the company doesn&#8217;t discuss potential
business plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ConocoPhillips and Apache Corp. are the largest U.S.
independent oil and gas producers by market value. Independent
oil producers don&#8217;t own refineries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boaz Weinstein&#8217;s Saba Capital
Management LP has exited credit-derivatives trades against
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s London chief investment office, according
to a person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weinstein, 39, was among hedge-fund managers who profited
from price dislocations in a credit-default swaps index after
outsized trades by JPMorgan&#8217;s Bruno Iksil, nicknamed the London
Whale, said the person, who asked not to be identified because
the trading is private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trades in London, first reported by Bloomberg News on
April 5, saddled the biggest U.S. bank with a $2 billion trading
loss that JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said last
month could grow. A strategy intended to scale back a hedge
against a financial crisis backfired, leaving what Dimon has
said were even bigger and harder-to-manage exposures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saba&#8217;s main $5 billion fund has returned 2.3 percent this
year through June 22, a person familiar with the fund&#8217;s returns
said. That compares with a 1.1 percent gain in Hedge Fund
Research Inc.&#8217;s HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weinstein declined to comment, said Jonathan Gasthalter, a

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is &#8220;very

they&#8217;ve all become a lot more closely connected,&#8221; Jesse said
today on a panel at an agriculture conference in London.

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO) said the company and
its local partners plan to spend $5 billion in India by 2020 on
expanding its distribution and adding capacity to meet rising
demand in the world&#8217;s second-most populous nation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company and its bottling partners will invest $30
billion globally in five years on new plants and sales networks,
Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent said at a press conference
in New Delhi today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kent aims to boost sales in a country where 12 of his
products are consumed per person annually, compared with 38 in
China, 40 in Kenya and 92 as global average. The Atlanta-based
company expects India&#8217;s large population of teenagers,
increasing urbanization, changing lifestyles and expanding
economy to drive demand for its products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All of which explains why we believe this business has
near limitless growth potential,&#8221; said Kent. &#8220;India is a
wonderfully diverse country. Dynamic, young and emergent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola targets India to be among its top five countries
by volume from seventh now, according to Kent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s non-alcoholic beverages market is estimated by
Euromonitor International to double to 12.9 billion liters in
2015 from 6.2 billion liters in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Market Share &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola&#8217;s subsidiary held a 25 percent share of the non-
alcoholic beverages market in India in 2010, ahead of rival
PepsiCo Inc. (PEP)&#8217;s 20 percent, according to data from Euromonitor.
Parle Bisleri Ltd., based in Mumbai, also had a 25 percent
market share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The India investment includes the $2 billion the world&#8217;s
largest soft-drink maker and its partners announced in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tata Global Beverages Ltd. (TGBL), which sells Tetley Tea and
Eight O&#8217;Clock coffee, said in February it plans to market a
nutrient beverage in India with PepsiCo&#8217;s local unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola&#8217;s India unit sells beverages including Coca-Cola,
Diet Coke, Fanta and Sprite, fruit drinks Minute Maid and Maaza,
and Kinley bottled water through more than 1.5 million outlets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company first began selling its products in the country
in 1952, but exited the market in 1977 when government
regulations changed and required the company to have a local
partner. It returned to India in 1993, after the change in rules
allowed a wholly owned subsidiary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beverage maker seeks to increase sales in India as part
of its so-called 2020 Vision announced in November 2009,
according to Kent. The plan entails boosting the company&#8217;s
annual revenue, including that of its system of global
distributors, to $200 billion by the end of the decade. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Macau casino stocks declined in Hong
Kong trading amid speculation visa restrictions and limits on
some China credit cards are slowing revenue growth in the
world&#8217;s largest gambling hub. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27) dropped 5.7 percent to
close at HK$18.12, Sands China Ltd. (1928) declined 5.8 percent, Wynn
Macau Ltd. lost 2.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth in mainland Chinese visitors to Macau may have
softened in May as the Guangdong local government might be
tightening visa issuance and as China UnionPay reduces the
amount that can be spent overseas on credit cards, Chinese-
language Macau Daily reported on June 23. Macau casino gambling
revenue rose 7.3 percent in May, the slowest pace since July
2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Recent weakness in Macau gaming revenue and visitation
growth could be partially explained by the visa restrictions and
reduction in China UnionPay limits highlighted by the Macau
Daily,&#8221; Cameron McKnight, an analyst at Wells Fargo  Co., said
in a June 25 research note. &#8220;While expectations have recently
moderated, we believe outperformance in the Macau stocks is
likely to be limited here.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visitors from the mainland drove casino revenue up 42
percent last year in the only city in China where casino
gambling is legal, pushing up earnings at Macau operators. About
16 million mainland Chinese tourists visited the city in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gambling revenue for the six casino operators in the former
Portuguese colony rose last month to 26.1 billion patacas ($3.3
billion) from 24.3 billion patacas a year earlier, according to
the Chinese city&#8217;s Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The report on visa tightening is a bit speculative,&#8221;
said Grant Govertsen, a Macau-based analyst at Union Gaming
Group. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t seen anything so far to convince us this is
happening.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MGM China Holdings Ltd. (2282) slumped 4.8 percent, SJM Holdings
Ltd. (880), founded by billionaire Stanley Ho, dropped 1.98 percent,
Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. (6883) dropped 2.5 percent in Hong Kong
trading. The city&#8217;s benchmark Hang Seng Index gained 0.45
percent. &lt;/p&gt;

Office declined to comment on the newspaper report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s decade-long
struggle against a European Union antitrust probe that led to
more than 1.68 billion euros ($2.1 billion) in fines will enter
its final phase tomorrow when an EU court rules on the company&#8217;s
challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest software company asked the EU General
Court to void an 899 million-euro fine imposed after Microsoft
failed to comply with a 2004 antitrust order to provide rivals
with data to help them work with the company&#8217;s operating-system
software. The fine was on top of Microsoft&#8217;s earlier penalties
of 497 million euros and 280.5 million euros and surpassed only
by a 1.06 billion-euro levy against Intel Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The two fines for Microsoft and Intel certainly sent a
message,&#8221; said Ted Henneberry, a lawyer at Bingham McCutchen
LLP in Washington who has previously worked for Microsoft on
matters not related to the EU case. &#8220;This thing is history now.
Today companies realize that you&#8217;re better served trying to work
things out with the&#8221; European Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s Windows software powered 95 percent of
personal-computers in 2004, when EU regulators fined the company
a record 497 million euros and ordered it to offer a version of
the software without a music and video player. Now, amid a
global slump in PC sales, Microsoft is preparing to manufacture
its first tablet to challenge Apple&#8217;s Inc.&#8217;s iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is the only company in more than 50 years of EU
competition policy penalized for failing to comply with an
order. The Redmond, Washington-based company agreed to a
settlement in 2009 in a bid to repair the company&#8217;s relationship
with the European Commission. Microsoft is now on the other side
of the fence, filing complaints against Google Inc. (GOOG) and what is
now its Motorola Mobility unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Other Foot&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brad Smith, Microsoft&#8217;s general counsel, last year wrote of
the irony of complaining to EU regulators about Google after
&#8220;more than a decade wearing the shoe on the other foot with the
European Commission.&#8221; Microsoft alleged that Google&#8217;s &#8220;pattern
of actions&#8221; entrenches the search engine operator&#8217;s control
over online search and related advertising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, based in Mountain View, California, was told by the
EU last month it could avoid an antitrust complaint over
allegations that it discriminates against rivals if it offered
to settle a probe by early July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding Microsoft chances of success tomorrow in its
case, Robin Koch, a spokesman for the software maker in
Brussels, and Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for the commission,
declined to comment ahead of the ruling. Microsoft may make one
final appeal of the ruling to the EU&#8217;s highest court, the
European Court of Justice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;License Guidance &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft argued at a hearing last year that regulators
should have given it more guidance to avoid the fine. Under the
initial decision, Microsoft was ordered to provide data to
competitors to allow servers to connect to computers using the
Windows operating system. It was also required to limit to a
&#8220;reasonable&#8221; amount the royalties it charged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fine was a so-called periodic penalty calculated
because Microsoft was in breach of the EU order for 488 days,
regulators said in 2008. The EU assessed Microsoft&#8217;s proposals
for 306 days of that period, the company told judges at the
hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also questioned EU reports prepared by a trustee
responsible for monitoring the company&#8217;s compliance with the
2004 decision. Although Microsoft lost a 2007 appeal of the
initial fine, the court ruled regulators were wrong to force the
company to give powers to the independent trustee who had access
to its documents, premises and software source code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bright Line &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The big issue is whether it was reasonable for the
commission to fine an enormous amount of money for non-
compliance with what was not a bright-line issue,&#8221; said Becket
McGrath, a lawyer at Edwards Wildman Palmer UK LLP in London.
&#8220;The issue of whether or not there was compliance is a very
technical one&#8221; and depends on the price Microsoft charged for
the interoperability information and what it had to disclose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tribunal &#8220;might give guidance&#8221; on whether Microsoft&#8217;s
proposed royalty rates for the interoperability information were
excessive, said Thomas Vinje, a lawyer at Clifford Chance LLP
who represented International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and Oracle
Corp. (ORCL), which opposed Microsoft in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fair and reasonable licensing terms, or FRAND, form &#8220;the
core&#8221; of three investigations regulators opened this year into
whether Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) and Google&#8217;s Motorola Mobility
used their control of standard technology patents to block
competitors&#8217; devices, the EU&#8217;s antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia
said this month. He said there was a need &#8220;to clarify what are
the implications of FRAND and how FRAND negotiations should be
conducted.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft filed a complaint with EU regulators earlier this
year, alleging that Motorola Mobility was &#8220;attempting to block
sales&#8221; of Windows computers and the Xbox game console by
overcharging for key technology patents. Motorola Mobility,
which Google bought last month, offered to settle the dispute.
Google also complained to the EU that Microsoft and Nokia Oyj
unfairly colluded to use patents to block rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The court could opine on what constitutes fair,
reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing terms in this case,
and some in the antitrust community rightly or wrongly would be
likely to interpret any such decision as a precedent for other
pending FRAND cases,&#8221; Vinje said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is T-167/08, Microsoft v. European Commission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FalconStor Software Inc. agreed to
pay $5.8 million to settle U.S. claims that it bribed executives
at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal officials accused the Melville, New York-based data
storage company of paying more than $300,000 in bribes to the
bank&#8217;s executives in an effort to win $12 million in contracts.
The company also falsified its books to cover up the scheme,
according to a statement from the Justice Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FalconStor entered into a deferred prosecution agreement as
part of its arrangement with the U.S. Attorney. A civil suit was
also filed against the company over the allegations by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. That action was also
settled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan wasn&#8217;t accused of wrongdoing in either case.
Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for the bank, declined to
comment on the settlements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This has obviously been a very large distraction for the
company and we&#8217;re pleased that we&#8217;re able to reach a settlement
and move forward and conduct our business right,&#8221; FalconStor
President and Chief Executive Officer Jim McNiel said in a phone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From October 2007 to September 2010, FalconStor offered
several JPMorgan technology executives bribes that included
FalconStor stock, gift cards, golf memberships and gambling
vouchers, according to a criminal complaint filed in Brooklyn
federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Licensing Contracts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In exchange for the bribes, JPMorgan entered into at least
three licensing contracts for FalconStor software and related
services, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FalconStor was accused of violating the Travel Act, which
bars interstate and foreign travel or transportation to aid
racketeering enterprises, as well as the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data storage company&#8217;s employees and officers who were
involved in the scheme have either resigned or were terminated,
according to a Justice Department statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has also fired employees implicated in the scheme,
Assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick Sinclair said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. FalconStor Software Inc.,
1:12-mj-00615, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York
(Brooklyn). The SEC case is Securities and Exchange Commission
v. FalconStor Software Inc., 1:12-cv-03200, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hutchin Hill Capital LP, the hedge
fund founded by Neil Chriss, has exited trades betting against
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) trader Bruno Iksil in a credit-derivatives
index, according to a person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chriss, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. trader who later
managed a portfolio at SAC Capital Management LLC, was among
hedge-fund managers who took advantage of gaps between the price
of the index and its constituents created by Iksil&#8217;s outsized
bets that earned him the nickname London Whale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is seeking to contain a trading loss in its chief
investment office that stood at $2 billion when it was disclosed
almost seven weeks ago. Bloomberg News first reported in April
that Iksil had amassed positions in Series 9 of the Markit CDX
North America Investment Grade Index that were so large he drove
the cost of contracts on the index below the average cost of
credit swaps on the 121 companies it&#8217;s tied to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chriss started Hutchin Hill in 2008 with $300 million from
Renaissance Technologies Corp. founder James Simons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saba Capital Management LP, the hedge fund run by Boaz Weinstein, closed similar trades, a person familiar with that
fund said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supplying electricity to the
&#8220;billions of people living in abject poverty&#8221; is a more
important goal than curbing greenhouse-gas emissions, Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM) Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electricity will do more to improve the quality of life for
people who still cook food by burning animal dung than trying to
prevent climate change, which will be &#8220;manageable,&#8221; Tillerson
said at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmental groups and scientists are urging reductions
in the use of fossil fuel-fired power plants, the largest man-
made source of greenhouse-gas emissions tied to global warming.
Tillerson said other issues should take precedence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are much more pressing priorities that we, as a
human race, need to deal with,&#8221; he said. The world&#8217;s poorest
residents &#8220;don&#8217;t even have access to fossil fuels to burn.
They&#8217;d love to burn fossil fuels because their quality of life
would rise immeasurably.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People will adapt to rising sea levels and changing weather
patterns resulting from climate change, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Increasing CO2 emissions in the atmosphere will have a
warming impact,&#8221; Tillerson said. &#8220;It&#8217;s an engineering problem
and it has an engineering solution.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farmers may shift crops to new regions as temperatures
rise. &#8220;As a species, that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re all still here,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;We adapt.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil, under prior CEO Lee Raymond, funded groups
that questioned the impact of global warming. Since Tillerson
took over the company in 2006, he has spoken more openly about
climate change. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walter Haefner, the world&#8217;s oldest
billionaire, who gained his riches from importing cars to
Switzerland and then becoming the biggest shareholder of U.S.
software-maker CA Inc. (CA), has died. He was 101. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haefner died on June 19 &#8220;after a long and fulfilled
life,&#8221; according to a statement on the website of Amag
Automobil und Motoren AG, the Swiss car dealership he founded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haefner was the oldest person with a net worth exceeding $1
billion and the third-richest Swiss, with $4.3 billion,
according to Forbes magazine. His death makes David Rockefeller,
97, the U.S. banker and grandson of Standard Oil founder John D.
Rockefeller, the eldest billionaire, with $2.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An entrepreneur, Haefner sold wood-gas-powered cars during
World War II. After shifting his focus to software in the 1970s,
he acquired what became a 24.8 percent stake in Islandia, New
York-based CA, the world&#8217;s second-largest maker of mainframe-
computer programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He &#8220;saw the promise in a digital future,&#8221; Sam Wyly, the
Dallas-based businessman who built a fortune in technology and
retailing, wrote about Haefner in his 2008 book, &#8220;1,000 Dollars
and an Idea: Entrepreneur to Billionaire.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haefner also was a breeder and rider of thoroughbreds. One
of his horses, Go And Go, won the 1990 Belmont Stakes in Elmont,
New York. He owned a share of Secretariat, the 1973 Triple Crown
winner, William Nack wrote in his 1988 book, &#8220;Secretariat: The
Making of a Champion.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scholarship Student &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter Haefner was born in Zurich on Sept. 13, 1910. He was
raised with his six siblings by his mother Elise, while his
missionary father August Wilhem spent much of the time in Tibet.
Haefner enrolled in the University of Zurich and the University
of Lyon in France with the aid of a scholarship from the City of
Zurich, according to Bilanz magazine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haefner founded Amag in January 1945 on Zurich&#8217;s lakefront.
The company grew to become Switzerland&#8217;s biggest car dealership
and main importer of Volkswagen, Seat, Skoda and Audi vehicles,
according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early 1960s, Haefner moved Amag&#8217;s accounting and
payroll to an International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) system and
then started Automation Center AG, a computer services firm,
Forbes reported in 2000. He got into the U.S. computer services
business in 1976 with the purchase of a majority stake in
Dallas-based Wyly, which later renamed itself Uccel Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Computer Illiterate &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CA, then known as Computer Associates International Inc.,
bought Uccel in 1987 and Haefner received a chunk of its stock.
His CA holdings, described in a June 10, 2011, proxy statement
on the company&#8217;s website, were worth $2.4 billion in August
2011. He never learned basic computer skills, according to
Forbes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haefner developed a passion for thoroughbreds after his
first ride on a racehorse in Paris in 1959, Nack wrote in
&#8220;Secretariat.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I loved it, the sensation of speed on a horse,&#8221; Haefner
said, according to the book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1962, he won the European cup for amateur riders,
according to Forbes. That same year he bought Moyglare Stud Farm
in Ireland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haefner had a daughter, Eva-Maria Bucher, and a son, Martin
Walter Haefner, who became chairman of Amag&#8217;s holding company
Careal Holding AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The senior Haefner lived with his fourth wife, France, in a
six-bedroom house in Kuesnacht, outside Zurich, that he bought
in 1948, according to Bilanz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m a simple man, who has simple pleasures,&#8221; he told
Forbes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) lost a European
Union challenge to an 899 million-euro ($1.1 billion) antitrust
fine, with a court saying it &#8220;essentially&#8221; upheld the penalty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU General Court cut the fine by 39 million euros, or
4.3 percent, to 860 million euros in a ruling today. The
Luxembourg-based tribunal rejected all of Microsoft&#8217;s arguments
over the fine levied by the European Commission for the
company&#8217;s failure to obey an order to share data with rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fine was on top of Microsoft&#8217;s earlier penalties
of 497 million euros and 280.5 million euros in the antitrust
case and surpassed only by a 1.06 billion-euro levy against
Intel Corp. during a period of EU scrutiny of U.S. technology
companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court&#8217;s endorsement of the fines &#8220;is likely to
embolden the commission in pursuing procedural violations,&#8221;
said Suzanne Rab, a lawyer at King  Spalding LLP, Rab worked on
assignment at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in 2008 on matters
unrelated to its work monitoring Microsoft&#8217;s compliance with the
EU order, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s Windows software powered 95 percent of
personal-computers in 2004, when EU regulators fined the company
a record 497 million euros and ordered it to offer a version of
the software without a music and video player. Now, amid a
global slump in PC sales, Microsoft is preparing to manufacture
its first tablet to challenge Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fines Paid &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, said while it was
disappointed, it paid the fine several years ago. The world&#8217;s
largest software company can challenge today&#8217;s decision at the
EU&#8217;s highest court, the European Court of Justice. Microsoft
didn&#8217;t appeal a court ruling it lost in 2007 that sought to
overturn the 2004 order, unaware that judges were split 7-6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s ruling backed the EU&#8217;s so-called periodic penalty
calculated because Microsoft was in breach of the EU order for
488 days, regulators said in 2008. The court cut the fine to
take into account a letter from the commission in 2005 that
accepted limits on Microsoft&#8217;s supply of information to open-
source software developers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joaquin Almunia, the EU&#8217;s antitrust chief, said the
judgment &#8220;fully vindicates the enforcement action that the
commission took to ensure Microsoft&#8217;s compliance with its
obligations,&#8221; paving the way for &#8220;a range of innovative
products that would otherwise not have seen the light of day.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is the only company in more than 50 years of EU
competition policy penalized for failing to comply with an
order. The company reached a settlement in 2009, which allowed
today&#8217;s appeal, in a bid to repair the company&#8217;s relationship
with the European Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is now on the other side of the fence, filing
complaints against Google Inc. (GOOG) and what is now its Motorola
Mobility unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is T-167/08, Microsoft v. European Commission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Macau&#8217;s tourism office said it
hasn&#8217;t received any notice of China tightening visa rules a day
after Hong Kong-traded casinos dropped on speculation of
restrictions on tourists from the mainland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casino operators including Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd.
and Sands China Ltd. (1928) fell yesterday following a Macau Daily
report that growth in the number of mainland visitors may have
slowed as the Guangdong local government could be tightening
rules on issuing visas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visitors from the mainland drove casino revenue up 42
percent last year in the only city in China where casinos are
legal, pushing up earnings at Macau operators. About 16 million
mainland Chinese visited the world&#8217;s largest gambling hub in
2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have not received any notice on China tightening visa
issuance to visitors traveling to Macau,&#8221; Gigi Chiu,
spokeswoman for the Macau Government Tourist Office said by e-
mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese nationals need visas to go to Hong Kong and Macau,
which are special administrative regions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts said they called
several offices of China&#8217;s Division of Exit and Entry
Administration Department, which handles visa issuance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Based on their responses we are not aware of any change
in visa application process or timing,&#8221; analyst Billy Ng said
in a June 26 note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sands China rose 1.8 percent to HK$23.10 at a 4 p.m. close
in Hong Kong. Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27) climbed 3.5
percent, Wynn Macau Ltd. (1128) advanced 2.3 percent, MGM China
Holdings Ltd. (2282) gained 1.2 percent and SJM Holdings Ltd. (880) rose 1.3
percent. Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. (6883) fell 1.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drugmakers looking for lucrative
treatments for ailments from attention-deficit disorder to
diabetic foot ulcers can now snap up Shire Plc (SHP) at its cheapest
valuation relative to earnings in almost six years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shire, which has slumped after a generic version of its
Adderall XR drug was approved sooner than analysts projected,
was valued at 16.8 times profit this week, the lowest since
October 2006, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The $15.9
billion company now trades for about 30 percent less than the
median for comparable specialty drugmakers, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the generic&#8217;s approval added to setbacks that have
led analysts to cut earnings estimates for Shire, the Dublin-
based company&#8217;s net income and revenue are still projected to
climb to records every year through at least 2015, which Chase
Investment Counsel Corp. said could entice buyers. With Shire
now throwing off three times more cash relative to its stock
price than rivals and sales of its best seller Vyvanse forecast
to double by 2015, the drugmaker may attract Pfizer Inc. (PFE) or Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA), according to Lutetia Capital.
Novartis AG (NOVN) could also be interested, Barclays Plc said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There aren&#8217;t many targets like Shire out there,&#8221; Jean- Francois Comte, co-founder of Lutetia, a Paris-based hedge fund
that bets on mergers and acquisitions, said in a telephone
interview. For a large drug company, &#8220;Shire would clearly be of
the size to make an impact. You&#8217;re clearly buying this company&#8217;s
potential to transform research and development into revenues
and margins, and its exceptional cash flow.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Specialty Drugs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jessica Mann, a spokeswoman for Shire, declined to say
whether the company has been approached by potential acquirers
or would welcome an offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shire develops medicines prescribed by specialists,
treatments for rare genetic diseases and therapies for repairing
tissue and skin. Its sales have grown at least 15 percent a year
in four of the past five years, with more than 30 percent of its
2011 revenue of $4.2 billion coming from the attention-deficit
hyperactivity disorder drug Adderall XR and its successor
Vyvanse, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company was named as a potential takeover target this
year by Nomura Holdings Inc., Sanford C. Bernstein  Co.,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Exane BNP Paribas, even as the
stock rose to an all-time high of 2,300 pence ($35.85) in
February. Chief Executive Officer Angus Russell said in April
that Shire has &#8220;no special defenses&#8221; against an unsolicited
bid except its share price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stock Decline &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shire&#8217;s shares have fallen 21 percent from their February
highs amid setbacks to three of the company&#8217;s top five-selling
drugs. The drugmaker in March withdrew its application for U.S.
approval of Replagal, while its Lialda treatment for ulcerative
colitis failed a trial that would have expanded its use. This
week, Shire sank the most in more than nine years after the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration approved a copycat version of
Adderall XR two years before analysts expected it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 11 percent drop on June 25 left its shares trading at
16.8 times earnings, the lowest level since October 2006,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. At yesterday&#8217;s close of
1,812 pence, Shire was valued at almost 17.5 times profit, a 29
percent discount to the median for specialty pharmaceutical
companies with a market capitalization exceeding $1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Shire fell 1.3 percent to 1,789 pence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shire&#8217;s lower valuation now &#8220;may make it seem attractive
to one of the larger pharmaceutical companies&#8221; even after the
FDA&#8217;s approval of the Adderall XR generic, Peter Tuz, who helps
manage $700 million as president of Chase Investment Counsel in
Charlottesville, Virginia, said in a phone interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s
still a good franchise. It&#8217;s a good company and these things
happen to everybody.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cash Flow &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker also has a free-cash-flow yield of 6.4
percent, compared with a median of 1.9 percent for global
specialty drugmakers, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts, after cutting their growth estimates for Shire,
still project Shire&#8217;s net income will rise 14 percent or more
each year through 2014 to a record $1.4 billion, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. They estimate sales will climb to
highs as well, rising 31 percent to $5.5 billion by 2014 from
$4.2 billion last year, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henrietta Theorell, who manages about 4 billion Swedish
kroner ($570 million) at SEB Asset Management in Stockholm, said
the FDA&#8217;s approval of an Adderall XR generic may actually
increase the company&#8217;s allure to a potential acquirer by
removing an unknown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adderall &#8216;Clarity&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Shire has been cited as a takeover target for many years,
but the Adderall patent situation was always cited as a
problem,&#8221; Theorell said in a phone interview. &#8220;With improved
clarity and the ensuing price decline, it is a more likely
takeover candidate. It has a growing portfolio, ADHD is growing
very nicely and it also has its orphan drug portfolio. That&#8217;s an
area people want to get into.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shire is seeking to expand the use of its best seller
Vyvanse, which has patent protection through 2023, for major
depressive disorder, schizophrenia and binge eating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to its ADHD drugs, it generated 30 percent of
revenue from treatments for rare genetic diseases, such as
Elaprase for Hunter syndrome. The company paid $750 million last
year for Advanced Biohealing Inc., gaining the skin substitute
Dermagraft, used to treat diabetic foot ulcers, and has an
implantable spinal pump in development that would deliver its
rare-disease drugs to the brain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Teva, Pfizer &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva, the generic drugmaker that already markets a Shire-
authorized copy of Adderall XR and last year bought Cephalon
Inc. for more than $6 billion, may be a potential acquirer,
Lutetia&#8217;s Comte said. Pfizer, which lost patent protection on
its cholesterol pill Lipitor in November, could also be
interested in Shire as it seeks new drugs for growth, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pfizer would clearly benefit from a growth engine that
would be a significant size,&#8221; Comte said. &#8220;They have the
ability to do the deal, they probably need the growth and they
haven&#8217;t done anything in MA for a while.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yossi Koren, a spokesman for Petach Tikva, Israel-based
Teva, said the company doesn&#8217;t comment on rumors and
speculation, as did Joan Campion, a spokeswoman for New York-
based Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novartis may seek a takeover of Shire to obtain new sources
of revenue as the Swiss drugmaker faces the loss of patent
protection on its two best-selling drugs, Diovan and Gleevec,
said Michael Leuchten, an analyst at Barclays in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Patent Cliff &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diovan, a blood-pressure medication, will go off-patent in
the U.S. this year, while the cancer treatment Gleevec&#8217;s patent
is set to expire in 2015, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you&#8217;re Novartis and you&#8217;re looking to make it through
the first patent cliff with Diovan, and as you come out of that
you&#8217;re going into another one, which is Gleevec, you need to
find a way to soften that blow,&#8221; Leuchten said. &#8220;One way to do
it is to buy something that&#8217;s not necessarily related to your
existing business, but it&#8217;s big enough to soften that second
blow. It&#8217;s a financial plug.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric Althoff, a spokesman for Novartis, said the company
doesn&#8217;t comment and on rumors and speculation when asked whether
the Basel, Switzerland-based company was interested in Shire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any potential deal for Shire would be among the largest in
the industry&#8217;s history. With Shire valued at $16 billion
including net debt, a purchase of the company would rank among
the top 15 drug company takeovers, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Killing Vyvanse &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Shire is marketing Vyvanse as a replacement for
Adderall XR, it may not live up to expectations as users switch
to the cheaper generic version of the older drug, according to
Peter McDougall, CEO of London-based investment research firm
Druganalyst Ltd., who has followed the drug industry for 27
years. Half of the company&#8217;s revenue growth over the next five
years is forecast to be generated by Vyvanse, McDougall wrote in
a June 26 note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Cheap Adderall will kill Vyvanse growth,&#8221; he said in the
note. The news &#8220;sent Shire stock into a spiral dive. It has
been a long time coming.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as Shire begins to face generic competition, the
slumping stock price, long patent life of Vyvanse and its
&#8220;solid&#8221; rare-genetic disease business still make it an
attractive acquisition candidate, said Adrian Howd, an analyst
at Berenberg Bank in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Does the attractiveness of Shire as an MA target change
considerably on the basis of the news? No,&#8221; he said in a phone
interview. &#8220;Does the share price of Shire change significantly
on the basis of the news? Yes. So if you look at it that way,
there&#8217;s your answer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) plans an expansive
Xbox music service joining Spotify-style streaming with download
and online-storage functions similar to Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iTunes,
several people with knowledge of the situation said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based software maker is in talks
with major record companies for the needed rights, and plans to
begin service later this year, said the people, who asked not to
be identified because the discussions aren&#8217;t complete. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By combining the best features of competing services,
Microsoft seeks to build a digital product that lets customers
consume music any way they like. The maker of the Xbox console
is building the new music business after its unsuccessful effort
with the Zune service, which will close and move customers to
Xbox Music, the company said on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is negotiating with Vivendi SA (VIV)&#8217;s Universal Music
Group, billionaire Len Blavatnik&#8217;s Warner Music Group, Sony
Corp. (6758)&#8217;s music division, all based in New York, and Citigroup&#8217;s
London-based EMI, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All four music companies declined to comment in e-mails.
Jose Pinero, a Microsoft spokesman, also wouldn&#8217;t comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft fell 2 percent to $29.57 at 12:15 p.m. in New
York. The stock had risen 16 percent so far this year. On June
18, the company announced plans to produce its own line of
tablet computers called Surface. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Streaming Service &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xbox Music seeks to offer streaming for a monthly or annual
fee, similar to Spotify Ltd.&#8217;s subscription service, and let
consumers buy digital music through an online store, such as
Zune, Apple&#8217;s iTunes and Amazon.com Inc., the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is also seeking to offer Xbox Music users an
online locker accessible by multiple mobile devices running
Windows 8, the people said. Users could put entire collections
online, including music purchased elsewhere, for a monthly or
annual fee, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talks for the Xbox service are still early and
Microsoft may not be able to obtain all of the rights it&#8217;s
seeking, the people said. Even if successful, Microsoft may
choose to roll out features over time, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Xbox music service was announced June 4 at the E3
video-game conference in Los Angeles, without details about how
it will work or when it will be available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft announced the service without having record deals
completed. The company needs the four music companies onboard to
avoid releasing an offering with fewer artists than the Zune
service, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will hold
its third internal bond-trading session today after helping its
clients buy and sell $150 million of debt on the system in the
last week, according to a person familiar with the initiative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets plans to hold two
electronic-trading rounds, one for investment-grade debt and one
for high-yield, each day that it operates the new system, called
GSessions, said the person, who asked not to be named because
the details are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is starting GSessions as banks reduce the
amount of corporate bonds they hold, responding to regulations
requiring they increase capital as a buffer against losses. The
Volcker Rule, seeking to prohibit federally insured banks from
making bets with their own money, may also hinder lenders&#8217;
ability to commit money to buy securities from clients,
according to analysts including Sanford C. Bernstein  Co.&#8217;s
Brad Hintz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debt of Newmont Mining Corp., ATT Inc., Goldman Sachs and
Ally Financial Inc. traded in the sessions on June 21 and 26,
with 39 of the New York-based bank&#8217;s clients participating in
the five-minute sessions, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bid-Ask Spread &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank charges less for the electronic trades than for
transactions handled over the phone, the person said. The
difference to buy and sell the bonds, known as the bid-ask
spread, is posted before the trading begins and doesn&#8217;t change.
Goldman will step in to take one side of a trade if there is
interest from a buyer but no seller or vice versa. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) won&#8217;t have a
&#8220;major loss&#8221; in 2012 following the lender&#8217;s disclosure of
losses from credit derivatives that could amount to more than $2
billion this quarter, Richard Bove said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re not expecting JPM to run a major loss,&#8221; Bove, an
analyst with Rochdale Securities LLC, said today in a Bloomberg
Television interview with Tom Keene. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe that
there&#8217;s any likelihood that the liquidity of the company is
going to be affected by this.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, fell
after the New York Times reported the lender&#8217;s trading losses
from credit derivatives may eventually total as much as $9
billion, or more than four times the firm&#8217;s initial estimate.
JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has said the New
York-based bank doesn&#8217;t want to &#8220;do anything stupid&#8221; by
unwinding the trades too quickly and hopes &#8220;this won&#8217;t be a
significant item for us&#8221; by the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That would suggest that in 2013 JPMorgan will earn $22
billion,&#8221; Bove said. &#8220;If it earns $22 billion in that year, it
will make more money than any other bank in the world. Plus, it
will make more money than any other company in the United States
except five or six.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s losses have increased in recent weeks as the
lender sought to exit the holdings, the Times reported, citing
unidentified former traders and executives at the bank. The
disclosure of the trades is a &#8220;negative development,&#8221; Bove
said. Still, it would be a &#8220;terrible mistake&#8221; to have the one-
time loss change perceptions of JPMorgan, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Swaps Ease &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If this company has got earnings power in the $22 billion
range, how bad can it be?&#8221; Bove said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan dropped 3.8 percent to $35.40 at 9:32 a.m. in New
York. The firm&#8217;s shares gained 11 percent this year through
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is perceived to be the second-most creditworthy of
the six biggest U.S. banks, according to credit-default swap
prices compiled by Bloomberg. The cost of the contracts, which
protect investors against default on JPMorgan&#8217;s debt, is less
than any of those lenders except for San Francisco-based Wells
Fargo  Co., the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on JPMorgan eased to 139.3 basis
points today, from 172.1 basis points on June 12, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That compares with the average of contracts on JPMorgan,
Wells Fargo, Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley of 237.9 basis points
through yesterday, the data show. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) fell more than
6 percent in New York trading after the New York Times reported
the lender&#8217;s losses from credit derivatives may eventually
total as much as $9 billion, exceeding the firm&#8217;s initial
estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan dropped to $35.77 as of 8:44 a.m. from the $36.78
close in New York yesterday, and reached $34.50 earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said on May 10 the bank
lost more than $2 billion on bets in credit markets taken by its
chief investment office in London and that the loss could
increase by as much as $1 billion this quarter. Dimon, 56, has
said JPMorgan doesn&#8217;t want to &#8220;do anything stupid&#8221; by
unwinding the trades too quickly, and he hopes that by the end
of the year the holdings will no longer have a significant
impact on results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s losses have increased in recent weeks as
JPMorgan sought to exit its holdings, the New York Times
reported, citing unidentified former traders and executives at
the bank. The company has already closed out more than half of
its positions, the newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are now in the realms of speculation in terms of the
sheer scale,&#8221; said Christopher Wheeler, a London-based analyst
at Mediobanca SpA, who has a neutral recommendation on JPMorgan
shares. &#8220;The final loss will be offset by a number of items
including a debt-valuation adjustment gain and gains on the sale
of some of their Treasury securities. However, the larger the
number, the more difficult it is to reduce the impact.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sorkin Estimates &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Ross Sorkin, editor of the New York Times DealBook
and a host of CNBC&#8217;s Squawk Box program, said on CNBC today that
the losses would be in the range of $4 billion to $6 billion,
citing sources he didn&#8217;t identify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon told lawmakers this month the company would be
&#8220;solidly profitable&#8221; when it reports second-quarter earnings
on July 13. Although the trading loss had grown to $2 billion
for the quarter when the bank disclosed it in May, the net loss
for the CIO division at that time was $800 million. Dimon said
JPMorgan had $8 billion in gains in another trading portfolio
within the CIO and had used $1 billion of that to offset the
loss on the credit derivatives portfolio in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Times said JPMorgan may be able to get out of
the money-losing holdings by the end of this year, faster than
previous estimates. That would mean the company could earn $22
billion in 2013, &#8220;more money than any other bank in the
world,&#8221; Richard Bove, an analyst at Rochdale Securities LLC in
Lutz, Florida, said today in an interview with Tom Keene on
Bloomberg Radio and Television&#8217;s &#8220;Bloomberg Surveillance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Copyright Office says that
a sequence of yoga poses can&#8217;t be copyrighted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a release published in the Federal Register on June 22,
the Copyright Office found that &#8220;a selection, coordination, or
arrangement of exercise movements, such as a compilation of yoga
poses, may be precluded from registration as a functional system
or process.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policy statement acknowledged that the question of
whether a sequence of &#8220;preexisting exercises, such as yoga
poses&#8221; can be copyrighted has &#8220;occupied the attention of the
Copyright Office for some time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policy statement refers to the eight categories of
works that the federal copyright law specifically names for
protection, including &#8220;pantomimes and choreographic works.&#8221;
Because &#8220;exercise is not a category of authorship,&#8221; the
Copyright Office said in its statement, a &#8220;compilation of
exercises&#8221; can&#8217;t be copyrighted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question has dogged many in the yoga community. Last
year, Bikram Choudhury, the eponymous owner of Bikram&#8217;s Yoga
College of India, brought several suits attempting to enjoin
former instructors from teaching yoga that incorporated elements
that he used, including a hot studio and the sequence of poses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the litigation, the defendants submitted an e-mail from
Laura Lee Fischer, who was at the time the acting chief of the
office&#8217;s Performing Arts Division, stating that yoga sequences
couldn&#8217;t be copyrighted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new policy statement was a result of that e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Carson, the general counsel of the Copyright Office,
said in a telephone interview that the issue is one &#8220;that we
had been mulling over for quite some time. Once the e-mail from
the office surfaced in the litigation -- and it was at best an
incomplete statement -- we felt like we needed to set the record
straight.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carson added that the Copyright Office wasn&#8217;t seeking
comment on the statement because it isn&#8217;t a proposed regulation.
The statement clarifies &#8220;our practice.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawyers representing Yoga to the People have filed the
Copyright Office statement with the court. Jordan Susman, one of
the attorneys representing the defendants, said only that &#8220;the
Copyright Office statement speaks for itself&#8221; and otherwise
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choudhury&#8217;s lawyer, Robert Gilchrest, a partner at
Silverman Sclar Shin  Byrne PLLC in Los Angeles, didn&#8217;t return
a call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Microsoft Challenge to EU&#8217;s 899 Million-Euro Fine Rejected &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) lost a European Union challenge to an 899
million-euro ($1.1 billion) antitrust fine, with a court saying
it &#8220;essentially&#8221; upheld the penalty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU General Court cut the fine by 39 million euros, or
4.3 percent, to 860 million euros in a ruling yesterday. The
Luxembourg-based tribunal rejected all of Microsoft&#8217;s arguments
over the fine levied by the European Commission for the
company&#8217;s failure to obey an order to share data with rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fine was on top of Microsoft&#8217;s earlier penalties of 497
million euros and 280.5 million euros in the antitrust case and
surpassed only by a 1.06 billion-euro levy against Intel Corp.
during a period of EU scrutiny of U.S. technology companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court&#8217;s endorsement of the fines &#8220;is likely to
embolden the commission in pursuing procedural violations,&#8221;
said Suzanne Rab, a partner in the London office of King 
Spalding LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, said while it was
disappointed, it paid the fine several years ago. The world&#8217;s
largest software company can challenge yesterday&#8217;s decision at
the EU&#8217;s highest court, the European Court of Justice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s ruling backed the EU&#8217;s so-called periodic
penalty calculated because Microsoft was in breach of the EU
order for 488 days, regulators said in 2008. The court cut the
fine to take into account a letter from the commission in 2005
that accepted limits on Microsoft&#8217;s supply of information to
open-source software developers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is the only company in more than 50 years of EU
competition policy penalized for failing to comply with an
order. The company reached a settlement in 2009, which allowed
yesterday&#8217;s appeal, in a bid to repair the company&#8217;s
relationship with the European Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is T-167/08, Microsoft v. European Commission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Oracle Wins U.K. Supreme Court Ruling Over Marketing in EU &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle Corp. (ORCL), the world&#8217;s largest database maker, won a
U.K. Supreme Court ruling protecting its right to be first to
market its hardware in the European Union before third-party
resellers may do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment yesterday in London reversed a Court of Appeal
ruling in favor of M-Tech Data Ltd., which was sued by Sun
Microsystems Inc. in 2009 for importing Sun disk drives into the
EU after Sun sold them in China, Chile and the U.S. Sun,
purchased in 2010 by Oracle, may be first to market its goods in
the EU under an &#8220;economically controversial, but legally well-
established policy,&#8221; even if it had previously sold the
products elsewhere, the Supreme Court ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M-Tech, based in Manchester, argued that Sun tried to
control the secondary market for its hardware in the European
Economic Area valued at $1.07 billion in 2007, according to the
judgment. M-Tech claimed Sun did so by withholding data from
independent resellers that would have helped determine whether
certain goods had already been sold in the region, producing a
&#8220;chilling effect,&#8221; M-Tech said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The unlawful conduct alleged by M-Tech does not amount to
a defense, even if proved,&#8221; according to a court summary of the
judgment handed down by a panel of five justices. &#8220;On the
agreed facts, the disk drives were never marketed in the EEA
until they were imported by M-Tech without Sun&#8217;s consent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M-Tech is &#8220;surprised and disappointed with the decision,&#8221;
Harvey Stringfellow, the company&#8217;s lawyer at Hill Dickinson LLP
in Liverpool, said in a phone interview. &#8220;This was a case that
generated a huge amount of interest within the independent
sector for&#8221; information technology, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M-Tech had argued that Sun can&#8217;t enforce its trademark
because Sun is trying to divide the market in the 27-nation EU
in violation of laws permitting free movement of goods. The case
was filed as a trademark dispute because Sun has distribution
rights to products that carry its logo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle, based in Redwood City, California, acquired Sun in
January 2010, for $7.3 billion, and renamed the unit Oracle
America Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;House Democrats Say Pacific-Region Trade Talks Need Transparency &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A majority of U.S. House Democrats said talks on a Pacific-
region trade agreement the Obama administration is negotiating
with eight other nations haven&#8217;t been sufficiently open to
public and congressional scrutiny. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are troubled that important policy decisions are being
made without full input from Congress,&#8221; lawmakers led by
Representatives Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut and George Miller of
California said in a letter yesterday to U.S. Trade
Representative Ron Kirk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint, lodged by 132 of the 191 House Democrats,
reiterates comments by senators including Ron Wyden of Oregon
who have sought more transparency in discussions for the Trans-
Pacific Partnership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negotiations resume next week in San Diego to create an
agreement among the U.S., Australia, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia,
New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. The accord would cover
issues including small-business access to global markets,
agriculture, intellectual-property rights and protections for
companies that compete against state-owned enterprises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carol Guthrie, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade
Representative&#8217;s office, said in an e-mail that she hadn&#8217;t yet
seen the letter and didn&#8217;t have an immediate comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partnership is one of Obama&#8217;s top trade priorities, and
administration officials have said they are working
expeditiously to conclude the talks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Internet &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Netflix Wants Help From U.S. as Cable&#8217;s Caps Threaten Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix Inc., (NFLX) the provider of video by mail and over
Internet connections, asked U.S. lawmakers to prevent cable
providers from squelching its growth by imposing online-data
consumption limits for customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix, with 23.4 million subscribers, made its request at
a hearing yesterday before the House communications and
technology subcommittee in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When you couple limited broadband competition with a
strong desire to protect a legacy video distribution business,
you have both the means and motivation to engage in
anticompetitive behavior,&#8221; David Hyman, Netflix&#8217;s general
counsel, testified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session was called to examine changes since the last
broad revision to cable law in 1992, when few consumers used the
Internet and cable companies controlled 98 percent of the pay-
television market, according to a staff memo. The 1992 law set
terms for broadcasters to demand payment from cable companies
for their signals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, the U.S. television market has been reordered
by the emergence of satellite providers Dish Network Corp. (DISH) and
DirecTV (DTV) as competitors to cable, and an array of online video
providers including Netflix and Google Inc.&#8217;s YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix could face higher prices and lowered growth from
limits on data consumption by providers of high-speed Internet
service, or broadband, the Los Gatos, California-based company
said in a filing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Enforcement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Federal Government Seeks Comments on IP Enforcement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal government is developing a joint strategic plan
on intellectual property enforcement, according to a notice in
the Federal Register. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the office of the U.S. Intellectual Property
Enforcement Coordinator, known as IPEC, the government is
seeking public input in formulating its enforcement strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The request for comments and recommendations is divided
into three parts. The first seeks detailed recommendations from
the public regarding specific ideas for improving intellectual
property enforcement. It also seeks input on the existing and
emerging threats to the protection of intellectual property
rights, the identification of threats to public health and
safety and the U.S. economy resulting from intellectual property
infringement. Finally, IPEC seeks submissions to help develop
specific action items. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Submissions must be received on or before July 25. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Schwartz, re-hired by Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) this month to run its business in Asia, owns
about $91 million of stock in the bank, according to a filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwartz, 57, holds 949,028 shares directly and 4,000
shares through trusts established for his family, according to
the filing with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Goldman
Sachs closed at $95.86 in New York, where the firm is based. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment on Schwartz&#8217;s stake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwartz, now based in Beijing, worked at Goldman Sachs
from 1979 until his departure in 2001. He became chairman of the
Asia business and a member of the bank&#8217;s management committee in
1999, the same year that Goldman Sachs went public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his new role, he fills a position previously held by J. Michael Evans, who is now based in New York as vice chairman and
global head of growth markets. Schwartz was also named vice
chairman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evans owned 1,541,341 shares of Goldman Sachs as of March
26, according to the company&#8217;s proxy filing earlier this year.
Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein owned 3,152,524
shares and President Gary D. Cohn owned 1,831,566 shares,
according to the proxy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) said it will
hold off selling tablets based on ARM (ARM) Holdings Plc technology
when the next version of Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s Windows operating
system debuts later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard instead will focus on so-called x86 chips,
such as those made by Intel Corp., said Marlene Somsak, a
spokeswoman for Palo Alto, California-based Hewlett-Packard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision is a boon for Intel and Advanced Micro Devices
Inc. (AMD), the top makers of x86 chips. It marks a setback for ARM,
which from the outset won&#8217;t have its technology in Windows
tablets sold by the largest maker of personal computers. It also
indicates Microsoft wasn&#8217;t able to get one of its biggest
partners to line up behind a strategy of introducing multiple
operating systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For them to say they&#8217;re skipping this is a big deal,&#8221;
said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Gartner Inc. &#8220;If they
can&#8217;t get HP on board, that&#8217;s pretty indicative of the fact that
things are different and the old loyal partners can&#8217;t always be
depended on.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft plans to release its own ARM-based tablet,
lessening the impact of losing Hewlett-Packard as a maker of the
devices. The decision &#8220;was influenced by input from our
customers,&#8221; Somsak wrote in an e-mail. &#8220;The robust and
established ecosystem of x86 applications provides the best
customer experience at this time and in the immediate future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apple Challenge &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer makers will use ARM-based chips in devices that
run a version of Microsoft&#8217;s operating system called Windows RT.
Tablets using x86 chips will run Windows 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision cuts an already small number of Windows RT
tablets planned for this year&#8217;s debut, the first time Microsoft
has produced a version of its personal-computer operating system
for use on chips with technology from ARM, in a bid to quell the
dominance of Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft limited the number of computer-makers given early
access to the Windows RT code to ensure a smaller number of
high-quality devices. As the number dwindles, there&#8217;s additional
pressure that those remaining be successful, said Sid Parakh, an
analyst at McAdams Wright Ragen in Seattle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not a negative to have just a few, but they need to
be really compelling,&#8221; said Parakh, who suggests buying
Microsoft shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Business Customers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first Hewlett-Packard tablet with Windows 8 will focus
on the business market, Somsak said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard&#8217;s decision to avoid ARM initially was made
before Microsoft announced its plan to sell its own tablets in
competition with Hewlett-Packard, Somsak said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The computer maker had considered making an ARM tablet
using chips from Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) and was one of a small number of
computer makers chosen to get early access to the Windows RT
code, people with knowledge of the matter said. It opted to
focus elsewhere first, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the deliberations were private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple&#8217;s market-leading iPad is based on ARM technology, as
are most tablets on sale today. Intel (INTC) has had difficulty making
inroads with consumers purchasing devices with its chips, as
ARM-based tablets have had better battery life. Still, ARM
machines running the new version of Windows will only be able to
use new applications written for Windows 8 and Windows RT, while
the x86 machines can run older Windows apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said last week that it will sell its own tablet,
the Surface, breaking with a practice of relying solely on PC
hardware partners. The Windows RT version of that product will
be available when the new Windows goes on sale, while the x86
version is planned for about 90 days later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows 8 machines that sport Intel chips &#8220;will deliver
the most complete experience with the best performance and
compatibility across all computing platforms,&#8221; Intel said in an
e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Martin, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft, and Andy Phillips, a spokesman for Cambridge,
England-based ARM, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARM gained 1.3 percent to 505.5 pence in London. Hewlett-
Packard climbed 3.9 percent to $20.11 at the close in New York,
while Microsoft advanced 2.3 percent to $30.59. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s decision to
let Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew retire four days after the
bank disclosed a $2 billion loss in her division allowed her to
walk away with about $21.5 million in stock and options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drew, who resigned May 14, can keep $17.1 million in
unvested restricted shares and about $4.4 million in options
that she otherwise would have been required to forfeit if the
New York-based bank had terminated her employment &#8220;with
cause,&#8221; according to regulatory filings and estimates from
consulting firm Meridian Compensation Partners LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 30-year JPMorgan veteran, Drew also had accumulated
661,000 unrestricted shares of common stock worth about $23.7
million based on the May 14 closing price, $9.7 million in
deferred compensation and $2.6 million in pension pay as of Dec.
31, according to company filings. Altogether, Drew&#8217;s stock,
pension and deferred pay come to about $57.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;She was with that company for a long time,&#8221; said Frank Glassner, a partner at Meridian in San Francisco. &#8220;She was an
incredibly talented, well-thought-of employee, not only within
the company but on the Street. A lot of this money had been
earned over a great deal of time, not just yesterday.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the hands of England&#8217;s
government-run health system, Hinchingbrooke Hospital was called
&#8220;a basket case&#8221; in Parliament. Ali Parsa wants to show that
private enterprise can do a better job than the state in
providing medical care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parsa, an ex-Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker, wants to
change how U.K. hospitals are run, right down to the meals
served to patients. He&#8217;s chief executive officer of Circle
Holdings Plc (CIRC), which in February became the first for-profit firm
to take over a National Health Service hospital when it began
managing Hinchingbrooke in Huntingdon, England. Circle last
month raised 46 million pounds ($72.3 million) in part to help
the company pursue contracts to manage more NHS sites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People told us you can never run a hospital a different
way; you can never change the way NHS staff work,&#8221; Parsa, 47,
says in an interview at the company&#8217;s London headquarters. &#8220;We
have fundamentally changed them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the U.S. debates what role government should have in
health care, the U.K. is slowly putting some pieces of its 64-
year-old state-run health system into private hands to try to
improve patient care and reduce costs. Prime Minister David
Cameron says more choice and competition are needed to improve
the NHS. Instilling a profit motive in a government-owned
hospital means patient needs won&#8217;t come first, said Allyson
Pollock, a researcher at Queen Mary, University of London who
opposes privatization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s immoral, it&#8217;s obscene,&#8221; she said in an interview.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a system that&#8217;s going to be built on greed, not need.
It&#8217;s the antithesis of everything that we worked for for 64
years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Emergency-Room Waits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a medical point of view, Parsa appears to be doing
something right. Emergency-room waits at Hinchingbrooke, 70
miles north of London, have improved from the county&#8217;s worst to
its best and lengths of stay for people getting non-urgent
orthopedic care have dropped 38 percent, freeing up beds. The
company says serious incidents, such as medication errors or
patient falls, fell by 80 percent in May. Circle also will save
1.5 million pounds on purchasing this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circle&#8217;s bid for the 10-year contract to run Hinchingbrooke
beat 18 others. The company gets the first 2 million pounds of
profit from any surplus, and a percentage above that amount,
which the union that represents hospital workers has said will
benefit the company and its shareholders at patients&#8217; expense.
Circle must also fund the first 5 million pounds of any loss, a
risk at a hospital that already has 40 million pounds of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Patient Perks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circle isn&#8217;t new to the NHS. Its two-year-old private
hospital near Bath serves as many NHS patients as private
patients -- at NHS prices. Circle has run the U.K.&#8217;s largest
treatment center in Nottingham since 2008. The company plans to
open another private hospital in Reading in August or September
and has sites for more clinics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parsa says it&#8217;s possible not only to provide quality care
and a pleasant patient experience for rich and poor patients
alike, but to make money in the process. At the core of the
business strategy is increased efficiency, primarily through
shorter hospital stays. Patient perks, like inexpensive parking
and food prepared by a chef from a Michelin-starred eatery,
ensure that hospital beds stay full with more rapid turnover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Bath, Circle hired a hotel manager and chef from nearby
Lucknam Park Hotel  Spa, a five-star country house hotel.
People from the local village of Peasedown celebrate their
birthdays in the hospital cafe, says Shelagh Meldrum, the
hospital manager. No wonder: A recent lunch served to patients
consisted of scallops and crab salad over dill and cucumber,
followed by a gently grilled salmon main course and lemon posset
for dessert. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stock Performance &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taxi driver Dave McGlennon had a cyst removed from a finger
last year at the hospital. A high point: the food. &#8220;I had a ham
and cheese omelette with potato wedges&#8221; after surgery,
McGlennon says. &#8220;It was to die for.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financially, Circle has yet to succeed. The company had
revenue of 75 million pounds last year and has lost money every
year since it was founded in 2004. Circle&#8217;s stock has plunged 51
percent to 75 pence since its June 2011 initial public offering,
giving the company a market value of 98 million pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The publicly traded company owns 50.1 percent of a
partnership that operates the hospitals and clinics. Parsa and
institutional investors Lansdowne Partners, BlackRock Inc. (BLK), Odey
Asset Management and Invesco Perpetual are among the
shareholders. Employees, including doctors, own the other 49.9
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Taxpayer Funded &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circle&#8217;s approach to running a hospital is a radical
departure for the NHS. The government created the agency in
1948, bringing hospitals, doctors and other health-care
providers into one taxpayer-funded medical system for all. The
network now includes 257 general acute-care hospitals like
Hinchingbrooke. About 1.7 million people work for the NHS, which
provides free care for the U.K.&#8217;s 62 million residents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A network of three NHS hospitals in South London is holding
talks with the Department of Health about being put under the
control of administrators because it has racked up more debt
than it can pay. The department said June 25 that more than 60
other hospitals may be financially unsustainable and require
restructuring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NHS budget at its inception was 437 million pounds, or
9 billion pounds at today&#8217;s value, according to the department.
In the current fiscal year, the system will spend 106 billion
pounds. The government has approved an NHS overhaul with a goal
of saving 15 billion to 20 billion pounds on the annual budget
in the four years to 2014-15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Partial Strike &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overhaul prompted the British Medical Association,
which represents two-thirds of practicing doctors, to declare a
partial strike for June 21, its first work stoppage since 1975. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think the public looks at the U.S. health system and
doesn&#8217;t want to see big encroachment of the private sector in
the British health system,&#8221; said Diane Abbott, a member of
Parliament who speaks for the opposition Labour Party on health
matters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defending the Circle deal for Hinchingbrooke in Parliament
last year, the Department of Health&#8217;s undersecretary of state,
Frederick Curzon, said: &#8220;This is a hospital that in common
parlance could be described as a financial and clinical basket
case.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circle&#8217;s bells-and-whistles approach may be a hit with
patients like McGlennon. Skeptics say the company won&#8217;t be
judged on its cuisine as much as on the quality of its care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Clinical Results&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t personally go to a hospital based on Michelin-
starred food; I go to a hospital for clinical results,&#8221; says
Andrew Hine, a partner at consulting firm KPMG in London and a
former NHS hospital executive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Circle&#8217;s Nottingham facility, Parsa says patients are
eight times less likely to have to return to the operating room
within four weeks. In 2010-11, the facility had no resistant
Staphylococcus aureus or health-care acquired Clostridium
difficile cases. On the financial side, Parsa said the center
has made an 18 percent annual compound productivity gain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says other U.K. hospitals can benefit from Circle&#8217;s
approach. &#8220;If we can deliver what we deliver at NHS prices, why
can&#8217;t everybody else?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stock markets can soar or falter in
an instant. One day the European debt crisis is receding, the
next day the region&#8217;s on the brink of disaster. Economic
statistics never give investors the whole picture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these jarring times, Bloomberg Markets magazine in its
August issue asked six billionaires for their advice on which
stocks might outperform the market in the next 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their responses showed much disagreement: Peter Hargreaves,
the largest shareholder of Hargreaves Lansdown Plc, the U.K.&#8217;s
biggest retail broker, said water, health care and technology
stocks will outperform in the next 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casino mogul Phil Ruffin, who controls the Treasure Island
Hotel Casino in Las Vegas, and Mark Cuban, the owner of the
Dallas Mavericks basketball team, both say to avoid stocks
unless you have better information than the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pay off debt,&#8221; says Cuban. &#8220;Search online for the best
price on items your household needs. Pay local merchants in
cash, while still paying sales tax. You&#8217;ll never lose money or
sleep.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Catsimatidis, the owner of Red Apple Group Inc., which
counts a Pennsylvania oil refinery and the Gristedes grocery
store chain in New York City among its assets, says betting on
banking stocks like JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) will pay off. &lt;/p&gt;
