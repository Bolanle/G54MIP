<p>When is a hedge not a hedge? </p>
<p>That''s the question regulators from the Federal Reserve to
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are confronting
after JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) reported a $2 billion trading loss
from a credit-derivatives position Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon called a hedge. </p>
<p>Regulators are under pressure to respond to JPMorgan''s loss
as they finish writing the so-called Volcker Rule, which
restricts banks'' proprietary trading and is the most
controversial provision in the Dodd-Frank Act. They''re
scrutinizing the so-called hedging exemption in the proposed
regulation and probably will narrow the exceptions for trades
banks say are designed to mitigate risk, according to two people
familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s loss will reinforce the position of those who
want to be tough, Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts
Democrat and co-author of the financial-overhaul legislation,
said in a telephone interview. I do think it will mean Volcker
will not allow such trades. </p>
<p>The rule, named for former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker, is
intended to reduce the chance that banks will put depositors''
money at risk. Dodd-Frank, signed into law in 2010, largely left
regulators to define the provisions, and in October, they
released a proposal for the rule, which is scheduled to take
effect in July. In April, the Fed said banks would have two
years to implement it, as long as they make a good faith
effort to comply with the ban on proprietary trading. </p>
<h2>Pool of Investments </h2>
<p>Under the proposed version, bankers would be permitted to
do risk-mitigating hedging activities for aggregate
positions. That means using derivatives or other products to
reduce the risk of an entire pool of investments, as opposed to
a single transaction or position. </p>
<p>The JPMorgan loss has ignited a debate whether aggregate or
portfolio hedging is appropriate at all and how to define and
spot these trades. </p>
<p>Frank said he hopes regulators will prevent such positions,
allowing banks to hedge only against specific investments to
offset potential losses. </p>
<p>Aggregate hedging isn''t hedging, it''s a profit center,
he said. They are talking about making money out of it, when
hedges break even. </p>
<h2>Skeptical Look </h2>
<p>In the wake of JPMorgan''s loss, regulators clearly are
looking more skeptically at the claim about portfolio hedging
and what does the word aggregate'' in the law mean you have to
do, said Karen Shaw Petrou, a managing partner at Federal
Financial Analytics, a Washington research firm. </p>
<p>Wall Street has aggressively lobbied against the Volcker
Rule. The five regulators implementing the provision received
over 17,000 comment letters -- the most for any part of the law.
Bankers devoted the majority of their efforts to aspects other
than hedging, such as allowances for trading by so-called
market-makers who buy and sell securities to establish prices
and whether banks can take positions in sovereign debt. </p>
<p>JPMorgan employs 12 lobbyists and spent $7.6 million on
these activities in 2011, according to the Center for Responsive
Politics in Washington. Dimon led Wall Street bosses in a
closed-door meeting with Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo on May 2 to
press the central bank to ease regulations, including the
Volcker Rule. </p>
<h2>Public Challenge </h2>
<p>Dimon publicly challenged Ben S. Bernanke in June 2011 on
tougher oversight, asking whether the Fed chairman had a fear
like I do that overzealous regulation will be the reason it
took so long for banks, credit and job creation to recover
from the financial crisis. </p>
<p>Fed spokeswoman Barbara Hagenbaugh declined to comment. </p>
<p>The KBW Bank Index of 24 financial stocks has dropped 14
percent (BKX) since July 2010, the month Dodd-Frank was passed,
compared with a 16 percent gain in the Standard  Poor''s 500
Index of stocks. JPMorgan shares have underperformed both,
tumbling 21 percent to $31.93 on June 1. </p>
<p>Bank lobbyists now say they''re on hold in reaction to the
attention JPMorgan has attracted. Their complaints may only
strengthen the call for tougher rules, said Oliver Ireland, a
partner at Morrison  Foerster LLP. </p>
<p>The problem with this event is it doesn''t do the
industry''s credibility any good, so it''s not clear the industry
pushing a lot harder now would do any good, Ireland said. It
may create a backlash.'''' </p>
<h2>Egregious Mistakes'' </h2>
<p>Dimon, who asked regulators in a February letter to loosen
up their definition of portfolio hedging, said on a May 10 call
with analysts that JPMorgan''s chief investment office made
egregious mistakes'''' by taking flawed positions on synthetic
credit. He previously pushed the unit, which oversees about $360
billion, to seek profit by speculating on higher-yielding
assets, ex-employees said in April. </p>
<p>The positions were done with the intention to hedge the
tail risk for JPMorgan'''' and could result in an additional $1
billion loss or more as they''re wound down, Dimon said. But I
am telling you it morphed over time; and the new strategy, which
was meant to reduce the hedge overall, made it more complex,
more risky, and it was unbelievably ineffective.'''' </p>
<p>JPMorgan profited in 2011 by betting that credit conditions
would worsen. Then in December, the European Central Bank
provided long-term loans to euro-zone banks, igniting a bond
rally and leaving JPMorgan''s bearish bets vulnerable. So the
chief investment office made offsetting bullish investments
using credit-default-swap indexes that are thought to expire at
the end of 2017, according to market participants. </p>
<h2>Bearish Trade </h2>
<p>The office put on another bearish trade to protect against
short-term losses using contracts due in 2012, market
participants said. Losses may have mounted when prices between
the two indexes became distorted because JPMorgan was such a big
seller of insurance. The trader who built the credit-derivatives
positions, Bruno Iksil, was nicknamed the London whale''''
because the investments became so large. </p>
<p>Credit conditions subsequently deteriorated, and hedge
funds increased purchases of the 2017 contracts, sending those
higher than the 2012 index and boosting JPMorgan''s losses. </p>
<p>The company''s investments can''t be described in any way
as a hedge, Michael Platt, co-founder and CEO of BlueCrest
Capital Management LLP, said in a May 21 interview with
Bloomberg Television. I think it''s a trading loss. They
deliberately put the positions on. The London whale, who has
subsequently been harpooned, put the positions on. </p>
<p>Geneva-based BlueCrest manages $32 billion and took a
small position against JPMorgan, Platt said. </p>
<h2>Gone Too Far </h2>
<p>U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Gary Gensler and U.S. Securities  Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro both acknowledged May 22 the difficulty regulators face
in allowing some risk-mitigating hedging and then trying to
determine when it''s gone too far. </p>
<p>The challenge when somebody uses a word like portfolio
hedging'' is that it can mutate and morph into many things beyond
hedging specific positions, Gensler said May 21, 10 days
before the CFTC held a round-table discussion about narrowing
exemptions in the Volcker Rule. </p>
<p>An administration official told reporters on May 22 that
regulators will use the JPMorgan loss as a real-life example to
inform the final rule. Regulators feel pressure to react and
will scrutinize the hedging exemption, according to another
person who works for an agency involved in the writing of the
law who wasn''t authorized to speak publicly and declined to be
identified. </p>
<h2>Unpopular Regulations </h2>
<p>More stringent regulations are sure to be unpopular with
bankers. You wouldn''t want to make a big change based on one
event, said Tim Ryan, president and CEO of the Securities
Industry and Financial Markets Association, Wall Street''s main
lobbying group. This is a complicated proposal. </p>
<p>Lawmakers are using JPMorgan''s loss for political
expediency, and it''s unlikely that portfolio hedging actually
will be banned, predicted Douglas Landy, a partner at Allen 
Overy LLP in New York. </p>
<p>Banks do need the ability to mitigate risks in their
portfolio using derivatives, said Ernest Patrikis, a partner at
White  Case LLP. </p>
<p>It''s insanity to think that they shouldn''t be doing it,
said Patrikis, former general counsel at the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York. Regulators may consider options such as
forcing financial institutions to demonstrate more fully
their positions or restricting how they can hedge, he said. </p>
<h2>Prohibit Trades </h2>
<p>The Financial Stability Oversight Council, created by Dodd-Frank and led by Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner,
discussed JPMorgan''s loss and the Volcker Rule at a May 22
meeting, Treasury spokesman Anthony Coley said. It''s
premature to conclude whether the rule would have
prohibited these trades and the hedging activity the bank
conducted, Bryan Hubbard, a spokesman for the comptroller''s
office, said May 14 in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Senators Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, and Carl Levin,
a Michigan Democrat, who co-wrote the Volcker provision, said
JPMorgan''s trading losses underline why hedging on a portfolio
basis should be barred in the final version. </p>
<p>Pressure from lobbyists during the rule-making process
gave rise to regulatory loopholes that would allow proprietary
trading to be hidden within market-making, risk-mitigating
hedging and wealth management, among other areas, the senators
said in a May 17 letter to the Fed and other regulators. </p>
<p>The Senate Banking Committee has begun hearings on JPMorgan
and its implications for regulatory changes. The bank regulators
and Neal Wolin, Treasury Department deputy secretary, will
testify on June 6; Dimon will testify June 13. Dimon also will
appear before the House Financial Services Committee on June 19. </p>
<p>The main impact of JPMorgan''s sour trades will be to speed
up work on finalizing the Volcker rule, said Brian Gardner,
senior vice president in Washington at investment bank Keefe
Bruyette  Woods Inc. </p>
<p>Regulators are under the gun to finish in a way that is
totally unreasonable, which is to make sure there are no
losses at banks, he said. They''ve basically been assigned
mission impossible. </p>

<p>Walton Street Capital LLC, a real

portfolio of West Coast industrial properties, Crain''s Chicago
reported without say how it obtained the information. </p>
<p>Walton Street, whose managing principal is billionaire Neil Bluhm, bought the properties for $2.9 billion at the peak of the

billion of loans on the Chicago-based firm''s portfolio come due

<p>Iraq and Chevron Phillips Chemical
Co., a joint venture of Chevron Corp. (CVX) and ConocoPhillips (COP), signed
a letter of intent to evaluate the feasibility of developing a
petrochemical plant in the country, officials said. </p>
<p>The company would examine building a new facility and
upgrading an existing Iraq-owned petrochemicals factory in
southern Basra province, Hanaa al-Husseini, a spokeswoman for
the Industry and Minerals Ministry, said today in Baghdad. </p>
<p>Melanie Samuelson, a spokeswoman for Chevron Philips, said
in an e-mailed statement that the company, with headquarters in
The Woodlands, Texas, wants to assess the feasibility of
developing an integrated petrochemical complex. Both Chevron
Phillips and the ministry declined to give additional details,
including cost estimates or dates for the project. </p>
<p>Iraq holds the world''s fifth-largest crude reserves and the
fifth-biggest natural-gas deposits in the Middle East, according
to data from BP Plc that also include Canadian oil sands. The
government, which depends on crude sales for more than 90
percent of its official income, wants to diversify into
chemicals production and other industries. </p>
<p>Iraq''s oil output is on the rebound after stagnating for
years during the rule of Saddam Hussein, ousted by a U.S.-led
invasion in 2003. The nation burns off natural gas produced in
association with crude because it lacks the infrastructure to
use it as a fuel for electricity plants or feedstock for
petrochemicals. </p>
<p>The ministry''s al-Husseini said April 9 that Shell
Chemicals Ltd. agreed in a separate arrangement to study the
feasibility of a petrochemical plant. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank, may report a $4.2 billion second-quarter trading loss
in its chief investment office, according to an estimate by
International Strategy  Investment Group Inc. </p>
<p>The pretax loss would help cut second-quarter earnings to
65 cents a share, a 30 percent decline from an earlier estimate
of 93 cents, Ed Najarian, an ISI analyst, said in a note
yesterday. Weaker-than-expected trading and investment banking
revenue coupled with mark-to-market private-equity losses will
also weigh on results, Najarian said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56, said last
month the firm lost about $2 billion on trades conducted at its
CIO unit, which is charged with managing the bank''s idle cash to
earn a profit while minimizing risk. Dimon has said losses could
grow and it might take the rest of the year to liquidate the New
York-based lender''s trades. </p>
<p>The loss will be partially offset by $2 billion in
realized security gains, stronger mortgage-banking revenue and
so-called debt-valuation adjustments, Najarian wrote. Excluding
the trading losses, DVA and securities gains, Najarian estimates
second quarter operating earnings per share of 82 cents. </p>
<p>Najarian cut his 12-month price target to $47 a share, from
$52, and kept a rating of buy on the stock. JPMorgan fell
2.9 percent yesterday to $31 and is down 6.8 percent this year.
Kristin Lemkau, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to comment. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the world''s
largest brokerage, sank to its lowest closing price since
December 2008 as investors weighed a potential credit-rating
cut, Europe''s debt crisis and lower trading revenue. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley fell 37 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $12.36 at
4 p.m. in New York, its third decline of more than 2 percent in
the past four trading days. That''s the lowest since Dec. 2,
2008, less than three months after the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. roiled global markets. </p>
<p>Moody''s Investors Service may reduce Morgan Stanley''s
credit ratings by as many as three levels, the most among U.S.
lenders. The cut could force the firm to post added collateral
and pay more to borrow. Ed Najarian, an analyst at International
Strategy  Investment Group Inc., said in a note yesterday that
the firm''s fixed-income trading revenue probably will drop by
half in the second quarter as risk-averse clients pull back. </p>
<p>The fragility has a lot to do with the lack of their core
funding structure, Charles Peabody, an analyst with Portales
Partners LLC, said in an interview today on the Bloomberg
Surveillance radio program. They don''t have the same core
deposit base that a Bank of America or a Citigroup or even a
JPMorgan might have. I think it also has to do with where the
franchise is in its evolution. They''re still very much in a
transition phase. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) expanded the sports
and entertainment content offered through the Xbox, adding shows
like Monday Night Football to extend the life of its gaming
console and step up competition with Sony Corp. (6758) and Nintendo Co. </p>
<p>The Xbox 360''s online service will gain 35 entertainment
providers, Yusuf Mehdi, chief marketing officer for Microsoft''s
Interactive Entertainment division, said today at the E3 trade
show in Los Angeles. Microsoft also introduced an application
called Xbox SmartGlass that will link the console to phones,
tablets and personal computers from Microsoft and rivals. </p>
<p>Microsoft is seeking to turn Xbox into a home-entertainment
system that lets consumers share programs and information with
all their devices, both competing with and connecting to gadgets
from Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG) Microsoft doesn''t plan to unveil
a new console until next year at the earliest, people familiar
with the matter said in March, so SmartGlass and the added
programming will help refresh the Xbox amid competition from
Sony''s PlayStation 3 and a new Nintendo console. </p>
<p>It''s a smart move, said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst
at Gartner Inc. It positions Xbox as the center of a personal
cloud ecosystem while allowing consumers to preserve the value
in their current hardware. Customers will probably be able to
use the SmartGlass app on existing iPads and iPhones, for
example, Gartenberg said, citing a briefing from Microsoft. </p>
<h2>SmartGlass App </h2>
<p>Microsoft, the world''s biggest software maker, will release
SmartGlass this year, allowing content makers to create uses for
the app. For example, HBO could use it to provide Game of
Thrones information to a viewer''s tablet while he or she is
watching, or Electronic Arts Inc. could let Madden NFL
video-game players draw a new play for their running back on
their phone and have the player execute it in the game, Mehdi
said in an interview before the speech. </p>
<p>The app will also serve to provide additional uses for
Windows Phones and Windows 8 tablets and PCs, scheduled to go on
sale later this year. </p>
<p>The new content, games and programs serve to round out
Microsoft''s vision of Xbox as entertainment hub, as Google and
Apple try to market television products and Sony and Nintendo
approach the market through their game consoles. Nintendo has
already announced a new machine, the Wii U, set to go on sale
later this year. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said today
that Xbox is now the best-selling video-game machine worldwide. </p>
<h2>Console Market </h2>
<p>Microsoft has made market-share gains in a slumping U.S.
video-game and console market. The company racked up more than
40 percent of U.S. console sales for 14 months straight through
April, according to market researcher NPD Group Inc. </p>
<p>In that month, U.S. sales of video-game hardware, software
and accessories tumbled 32 percent as consumer buying shifts to
downloads and games on social sites, said Port Washington, New
York-based NPD. </p>
<p>At a time when entertainment is becoming more
interactive, more fun, we are bringing together games, movies
and television shows on every screen in our lives, said Don Mattrick, president of Microsoft''s Interactive Entertainment
division, in a speech at E3. </p>
<p>Microsoft rose less than 1 percent to $28.55 at the close
in New York. The shares have gained 10 percent this year. </p>
<h2>Viacom, Univision </h2>
<p>New content for Xbox Live, which has 40 million
subscribers, will include Paramount films and Nickelodeon
cartoons from Viacom Inc. (VIAB), shows from Spanish-language
broadcaster Univision Communications Inc., 24-hour ESPN
programming and National Basketball Association games. </p>
<p>NBA League Pass will be available on Xbox Live for a fee,
giving customers more than 2,400 games, Mehdi said. A National
Hockey League subscription package offers more than 40 games a
week, he said. </p>
<p>Nike Inc. (NKE) will release a fitness game that uses Xbox and
its Kinect sensor to scan a customer''s body -- it can even tell
if the user has had knee surgery -- and recommends a workout
plan. The Kinect will then track whether the user is doing the
exercises correctly. </p>
<p>Microsoft today also demonstrated Halo 4, the next
installment in best-selling Xbox-only game franchise, which is
due to be available this fall. </p>
<p>In addition, the company showed an Xbox Music service that
is a revamped version of its Zune offering. The service will
offer 30 million tracks that can be accessed on any Microsoft
device. The company will also offer an Internet Explorer browser
for Xbox. </p>

<p>An intensifying financial crisis in
Spain or elsewhere in Europe has the potential to drive American
stocks into a bear market, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s chief U.S.
equity strategist said. </p>
<p>While David Kostin''s mid-year forecast for the Standard 
Poor''s 500 Index calls for a 3.7 percent gain from last week''s
close to 1,325, he said the measure may fall to 1,125 should the
situation in Europe worsen. That would give the SP 500 a more-than 20 percent loss since its 2012 closing peak of 1,419.04. </p>
<p>The June 1 report from Goldman Sachs said the most likely
scenario is Greek elections result in the nation remaining in
the euro zone. Concern it will leave has helped drag the SP 500
down 10 percent since April 2, including the biggest monthly
decline since September. Financial contagion or crisis in
Spain could prompt a bear market drop of 20 percent, according
to the report. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs also predicted a Greek exit from the euro
zone area could push the Stoxx Europe 600 Index down a further
3.8 percent to 225 and a policy response considered not credible
or bank disruptions in other countries may send the European
gauge to its 2009 low of 158. </p>
<p>Peter Oppenheimer, the London-based chief global equity
strategist at Goldman Sachs, reduced his three-month forecast
for the Stoxx Europe 600 by 5.8 percent to 245 last week. The
European measure slid 0.5 percent to 233.87 today. </p>
<h2>Three Events </h2>
<p>Kostin said investors face three upcoming macro events that
may add uncertainty: the second round of Greek elections on June
17, the Federal Open Market Committee''s June meeting and the
U.S. Supreme Court''s ruling on health-care reform. </p>
<p>The SP 500 has found valuation support around 11 times
estimated earnings in previous crises, according to Kostin. The
measure has not remained lower than a multiple of 11 for longer
than a month since the late 1980s, including during October 2008
and September 2011, he said. The U.S. index currently trades at
12.1 times analysts'' projected profits in the next year, while
the Stoxx Europe has a multiple of 9.7, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Barclays Plc''s Barry Knapp predicts the SP 500 may fall to
between 1,100 and 1,200 based on historic equity risk premium
levels, which looks at forward earnings yield minus the real 10-year Treasury (USGG10YR) yield. </p>
<h2>Quite Significant'' </h2>
<p>The benchmark gauge erased as much as 16 percent and 19
percent in 2010 and 2011 respectively as economic data weakened
and investor concern about a double-dip recession grew. A Labor
Department report last week showed payrolls climbed by 69,000
last month, less than the most-pessimistic forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey, after a revised 77,000 gain in April. Two
months of payroll gains below 100,000 significantly boosts
the likelihood of a third consecutive double-dip scare,
according to Knapp''s report. </p>
<p>There is little room for optimism in this morning''s
report, Knapp, the New York-based head of equity strategy,
wrote in the June 1 note after the release of the payrolls data.
Although the equity market has cheapened considerably, it is
not close to last year''s levels from a risk premium perspective
and if the uptrend in the equity risk premium continues, the
market''s fall may be quite significant. </p>

<p>The friendship between Rajat Gupta, a
former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) director, and Galleon Group LLC
founder Raj Rajaratnam took center stage this morning at Gupta''s
insider-trading trial, as prosecutors prepared to summon Goldman
Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein to testify. </p>
<p>Blankfein will testify as a government witness today, U.S.
District Judge Jed Rakoff said during a break in the testimony.
Blankfein, who was scheduled to testify on June 6, will take the
stand this afternoon because of a scheduling conflict with his
daughter''s graduation. </p>
<p>Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment on Blankfein''s testimony or his schedule. </p>
<p>Prosecutors concluded their questioning of Anil Kumar, a
former McKinsey  Co. partner, who told jurors in Manhattan
federal court about the friendship between Gupta and Rajaratnam.
Kumar said Gupta had invested $10 million in the Galleon Voyager
Fund in 2008, Rajaratnam invested $40 million, and the two
borrowed $300 million from Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. for the
fund. </p>
<p>He said that the $10 million had almost doubled in size
over the years, Kumar said of Gupta. </p>
<p>Later, the fund was wiped out in the 2008 stock market
collapse, angering Gupta and prompting him to consider filing a
lawsuit because of what he said was Rajaratnam''s mismanagement
of the fund, Kumar said. The litigation threat didn''t come up
until 2009, which was after Gupta allegedly provided illegal
tips to Rajaratman, Kumar said. </p>
<h2>Moral'' Responsibility </h2>
<p>Mr. Gupta said Mr. Rajaratnam had an ethical and moral
responsibility to Mr. Gupta because he had not held up to his
side of the management of the fund, Kumar said of Gupta''s
comments to him in 2009. Since Mr. Rajaratnam had lost all the
money, Mr. Rajaratnam had a moral and ethical responsibility to
make Mr. Gupta whole. </p>
<p>Gupta, who ran McKinsey  Co. from 1994 to 2003, is on
trial for leaking tips about Goldman Sachs and Procter  Gamble
Co. (PG), where he was also a director. One of the alleged tips
involved a Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/B) investment in Goldman Sachs.
Prosecutors say Gupta tipped Rajaratnam after learning about the
deal in a Goldman Sachs board meeting at 3:55 p.m. on Sept. 23,
2008. </p>
<p>Rajaratnam and Gupta are the biggest figures caught in a
nationwide insider-trading probe. Gupta, who has pleaded not
guilty, is charged with conspiracy and securities fraud, which
carries a maximum 20-year prison sentence. </p>
<h2>No Motive </h2>
<p>On cross-examination of Kumar, defense attorney Gary Naftalis sought to show that there wasn''t a close relationship
between the two men, suggesting that Gupta had no motive to leak
inside tips to Rajaratnam. </p>
<p>Kumar testified, under questioning from Naftalis, that
Gupta didn''t attend Rajaratnam''s 50th birthday celebration in
Kenya and that Gupta''s attention was focused primarily on the
Indian School of Business, which Gupta and Kumar co-founded. </p>
<p>The defense has pointed to Gupta''s threat to sue over the
losses in the Voyager Fund as a reason why he wouldn''t leak
inside information to Rajaratnam in 2008. In cross-examination,
Kumar testified that Gupta had complained in 2008, before the
2009 lawsuit threat, that Rajaratnam had dropped the ball in
managing the fund. </p>
<p>He''s generally a calm guy, Kumar said of Gupta. That''s
quite a bit of money to lose. </p>
<p>Gupta eventually concluded that Rajaratnam had taken money
out of the Voyager account without telling him, Kumar said. </p>
<p>He was very annoyed, Kumar testified. He told me he
was about to sue Mr. Rajaratnam. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Gupta, 11-cr-00907, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s trading loss
of more than $2 billion raises questions about the adequacy
and rigor of the bank''s risk-management practices, according
to U.S. Comptroller of the Currency Thomas J. Curry. </p>
<p>The OCC, JPMorgan''s prudential regulator, is actively
examining the New York-based bank, which disclosed the losses
from its chief investment office on May 10, Curry said in
remarks prepared for a Senate Banking Committee hearing
tomorrow. The agency has learned that the bank''s position
deteriorated rapidly at the end of April and during the
first days of May, he said. </p>
<p>Since that time, the OCC has been meeting daily with bank
management with respect to the bank''s response to this
situation, to re-evaluate the risk-management activities and
controls of the bank and how they applied to its CIO function,
and to determine what additional action is necessary, Curry
said in his statement. </p>
<p>The hearing will be the first public airing of the roles
played by the OCC, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. and the Treasury Department in the period before
JPMorgan Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon
disclosed the trading losses tied to credit derivatives. </p>
<p>Senator Tim Johnson, the South Dakota Democrat who leads
the committee, said the session will give lawmakers a chance to
probe the losses at the biggest and most profitable U.S. bank.
It may also provide a preview of the panel''s scheduled June 13
hearing with Dimon. </p>
<h2>Volcker Rule </h2>
<p>The OCC is not drawing any conclusions about whether
the trading that led to the losses would have violated the so-
called Volcker rule, which would ban proprietary trading by
banks that benefit from FDIC deposit insurance and Fed
borrowing. JPMorgan''s disclosure has heightened tension around
the Dodd-Frank Act measure being crafted by regulators, with
congressional Democrats and consumer groups saying the loss
shows the need for tougher restrictions. </p>
<p>It''s premature to reach any conclusion based upon the
facts and information as they currently exist, Curry said. </p>
<p>The final Volcker rule should prohibit activity, including
hedging, that does not reduce risks related to specific
individual or aggregate positions held by a firm, Treasury
Deputy Secretary Neal Wolin said in his prepared remarks. </p>
<p>The JPMorgan loss goes beyond the rule named for former Fed
Chairman Paul Volcker, Wolin said. It shows the need for banks''
senior managers to have effective risk models and accountability
for failure, and for regulators to have clear understanding of
banks'' exposures and risk-management systems, he said. </p>
<p>Ultimately, the true test of reform is not whether it
prevents firms from taking risks or from making mistakes, but
whether our financial regulatory system is tough enough and
designed well to prevent those mistakes from hurting the broader
economy or costing taxpayers money, Wolin said. </p>

<p>International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
has ended its information-technology sponsorship of the National
Football League because of differing views over how the
partnership should be handled. </p>
<p>We determined that our respective views on how the NFL
should manage the IT sponsorship were too different and we
decided not to renew our agreement, said Chris Andrews, a
spokesman for IBM. All discussions were amicable and we remain
on very positive terms with the NFL, and there is no reason why
we wouldn''t consider advertising on NFL games in the future. </p>
<p>IBM, based in Armonk, New York, had served as the NFL''s
technology sponsor since 2003, a deal that included consulting
and data-center management. The decision to end the arrangement,
which expired in March, followed months of negotiations, Andrews
said. The NFL move doesn''t affect IBM''s other sponsorships, he
said, without elaborating. </p>
<p>The company also is one of three sponsors of the Masters
tournament held at Augusta National Golf Club, the subject of
criticism over its male-only membership policy. In January,
Ginni Rometty became the first female chief executive officer at
IBM, which has declined to comment on future Masters''
sponsorship plans. The past four IBM CEOs have been invited to
be Augusta National members, and the current CEOs of other
Masters sponsors, Exxon Mobil Corp. and ATT Inc., are members. </p>
<p>IBM''s NFL sponsorship decision was reported earlier by the
Sports Business Journal. </p>
<p>Motorola Mobility, the mobile-phone maker that''s now part
of Google Inc., also ended its sponsorship deal with the NFL
this year, following more than a decade. The company''s brand had
appeared on the headsets worn by coaches on the sidelines. </p>
<p>After careful thought and consideration, Motorola
Mobility determined that it is in the company''s best interest
not to renew our sponsorship, Juli Burda, a spokeswoman for
the company, said in an e-mail. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS), aiming to combat
childhood obesity by banning junk-food ads, will require that
food and beverage advertising to kids on its TV networks and
radio stations meet new nutritional standards by 2015. </p>
<p>The guidelines, which follow federal recommendations, are
designed to promote fruits and vegetables, limit calories, and
curb the intake of saturated fat, salt and sugar, Burbank,
California-based Disney said in a statement. By the end of this
year, food products will begin bearing the Mickey Check
logo, signaling that they meet the standards. </p>
<p>The effort, announced today at an event with first lady
Michelle Obama, expands on Disney''s adoption of nutritional
guidelines in 2006. Disney is the world''s largest entertainment
company, with holdings that include film studios, theme parks,
radio stations and the ABC broadcast network. The company''s
media networks generated $7.6 billion in advertising revenue in
its most recent fiscal year, an increase of 8 percent. </p>
<p>The guidelines give specific standards. Breakfast cereals,
for example, should have no more than 130 calories and fewer
than 10 grams of sugar per ounce. </p>
<p>Disney was the first major media company to set nutrition
guidelines for licensed food products and taking this next step
is a win for us, a win for food companies, and a big win for
families, Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger said at the
Washington event. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is preparing to
release its first-ever version of its Office software for Apple
Inc. (AAPL)''s mobile devices this year, according to two people with
knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>The software will make the word-processing program Word and
spreadsheet-maker Excel available on Apple''s iPad tablets and
iPhones, said the people, who requested anonymity because the
product hasn''t been made public. </p>
<p>Adding Office software onto the iPad is key to Microsoft''s
growth, particularly in the corporate market. IPads accounted
for 97 percent of tablets bought by businesses in the first
quarter, according to a survey of users by Good Technology Inc.,
a maker of wireless-device security technology. Devices that run
Microsoft software and compete with the iPad won''t be
available until later this year. </p>
<p>The software could either be preloaded on some devices or
sold as an application at Apple''s App Store. There will be
competition: The top-grossing app last Christmas was Google
Inc.''s Quickoffice, a productivity tool for viewing and editing
Office documents. </p>
<p>Another app, CloudOn, which lets consumers use Word, Excel
and PowerPoint on tablets, has had more than 1 million
downloads, and raised about $10 million in venture capital,
CloudOn Inc. Chief Executive Officer Milind Gadekar said in an
interview. The startup has always expected Microsoft to come out
with its own version of Office for tablets and hopes to win
customers with extra features, Gadekar said. </p>
<p>Tablet sales will climb 85 percent to 126.6 million units
this year, according to IHS iSuppli Research. IPads accounted
for two of every three tablets sold in the first quarter,
according to data compiled by ABI Research and Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Mobile-Phone Presence </h2>
<p>Microsoft has been making an effort to increase its
presence on mobile devices. The Redmond, Washington-based
company struck a deal with Nokia Oyj to place its Windows
operating system on Nokia''s handsets and earlier this year
Microsoft showed off a version of the system run on ARM
processors, which are found on most mobile phones. </p>
<p>The company will release the next version of Office, called
Office 15, in the coming months, according to Microsoft.
Microsoft''s business division reported $5.81 billion in revenue
last quarter, a 10 percent increase from a year ago, as demand
for Office 2010 remained strong. </p>
<p>The Boy Genius Report said on May 23 that Microsoft is
planning to release Office for Apple and Android mobile devices
in November. </p>
<p>Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller and Microsoft spokesman
Jevon Fark declined to comment. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS)''s plan to bar junk-
food advertising from children''s programming would have cost
less than $7.2 million in television ad revenue if it were in
effect last year, according to estimates by Kantar Media. </p>
<p>That''s the amount that Disney generated from beverage and
food commercials aimed at children in 2011, the New York-based
research firm said. The figure is less a 10th of 1 percent of
Disney''s total annual advertising sales. The company reported ad
revenue of $7.6 billion for its media networks in its last
fiscal year, an increase of 8 percent. </p>
<p>Zenia Mucha, a spokeswoman for Burbank, California-based
Disney, said the company doesn''t disclose ad revenue from
individual networks or from particular advertisers. She said the
Kantar figure was inaccurate, without elaborating. </p>
<p>Disney announced today that the Disney XD cable network and
its block of Saturday morning shows on ABC will bar advertising
of foods and beverages that don''t meet its nutrition guidelines
by 2015. The same restrictions also will apply to the Disney
Channel and Disney Junior -- cable channels that feature
sponsorships but no commercials and therefore aren''t counted by
Kantar. </p>
<p>Kantar''s estimates suggest that the change isn''t a big
gamble for Disney, the world''s largest entertainment business.
The company also stands to gain from promoting healthier Disney-
endorsed foods. It''s developing a Mickey Check logo, which
will indicate that products meet its nutritional standards. That
will begin appearing by the end of 2012. </p>
<p>The company unveiled the plan at an event today with first
lady Michelle Obama, who has made healthy eating a signature
issue of her office. Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger
declined to comment on which products don''t meet the standards,
beyond saying that there were a lot. </p>
<p>We hope to work with these companies so that they can
continue advertising on our programs with a product that is
nutritious and meets our guidelines, he said at the event. </p>
<p>Giving parents assurance that Disney-branded products are
healthy will ultimately will increase sales, Iger said. We can
create huge change without having the government step in. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley will pay $6.75 million
to resolve claims that its futures brokerage unlawfully traded
positions off exchanges owned by CME Group Inc. (CME) </p>
<p>The trades during an 18-month period in 2008 and 2009 were
non-competitive and constituted fictitious sales that
violated commodity-market rules, the U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission said today in a statement announcing a $5
million fine against New York-based Morgan Stanley. The bank,
which was accused of supervisory and record-keeping violations,
will pay an additional $1.75 million to resolve related
complaints from CME and the Chicago Board of Trade. </p>
<p>Laws requiring that futures trades be executed on an
exchange serve important price discovery and transparency
principles, David Meister, CFTC''s enforcement director said in
the agency''s statement. Firms must have appropriate systems
and controls in place designed to detect and prevent the conduct
described in the order. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) employees, including a managing director,
improperly executed off-exchange trades in Eurodollar and
Treasury Note futures contracts in order to limit clients''
risks, according to the CFTC order. Morgan Stanley violated
commodity-market rules by failing to ensure there were related
cash or over-the-counter swap positions in the trades, the
agency said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley cooperated fully with exchange staff in
the matter, including by conducting a detailed internal
investigation, self-reporting issues it found, and putting in
place various enhanced controls, Mary Claire Delaney, a bank
spokeswoman, said in an e-mail statement. The orders do not
find that any customers were harmed, that the transactions were
conducted at commercially unreasonable prices or that the
transactions distorted or otherwise impacted market prices. </p>

court approval of a $44.6 million settlement of a lawsuit in
which it was accused of conspiring to rig bids on municipal bond
deals. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero in New York ruled
yesterday in a 2008 class-action antitrust case against JPMorgan
and other banks. This settlement applies to only JPMorgan and
its Bear Stearns unit. Other banks have settled, and state
attorneys general have entered into accords with banks. </p>
<p>The court finds the agreement was entered into at arm''s
length by highly experienced counsel and is sufficiently within
the range of reasonableness, Marrero wrote. </p>
<p>Justin Perras, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment on the ruling. Investors who brought the
suit include the city of Baltimore and the University of
Mississippi Medical Center. </p>
<p>Michael D. Hausfeld, a lawyer for the investors, didn''t
immediately return a call seeking comment on the approval. The
judge scheduled a hearing in the case for Dec. 14. As part of
his ruling, Marrero agreed that certification of the case as a
class-action suit was warranted. </p>
<p>The investors claim that the banks rigged bids and
restrained, suppressed or eliminated competition for
municipal derivatives, according to court papers. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world''s
biggest energy company, and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) said a U.S.-
led transformation of the natural-gas market will boost the
global economy even as oil becomes more expensive. </p>
<p>Natural gas is quickly becoming a key enabler of economic
growth and environmental progress around the world, Rex W. Tillerson, chief executive officer of Exxon, said at a
conference today in Kuala Lumpur. We are living at a historic
moment in the evolution of energy markets. How we respond will
shape the quality of life for generations to come. </p>
<p>A shale boom in the U.S. has helped it surpass Russia as
the world''s biggest producer of natural gas and brought the
country close to energy independence. Gas is poised to overtake
coal as the second-most widely used source of energy worldwide
by 2025, with demand in Asia projected to grow by more than 50
percent over the next three decades, Tillerson said. </p>
<p>Reserves of gas, a cleaner-burning fuel, are helping
rebuild the U.S. economy and enabling China to replace more-polluting coal, Peter Voser, Shell''s chief executive office,
said in a separate speech at the World Gas Conference in the
Malaysian capital today. </p>
<p>U.S. gas production increased 8.1 percent last year alone,
about the same as in four years in the previous decade, the
International Energy Agency said in report released today. </p>
<h2>U.S. Surplus Gas </h2>
<p>While the U.S. has yet to export LNG, it is already
physically exporting its gas surplus to neighboring countries,
including Canada and Mexico, according to the report. While
Australia''s LNG production was stagnant last year, the country
is expected to be the largest LNG supplier by the end of the
decade, the IEA said. </p>
<p>Shell, Exxon, Chevron Corp. (CVX) and Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) are
among companies leading $180 billion of liquefied-natural-gas
ventures in Australia that are underpinned by demand from Asia''s
biggest economies. China, estimated to hold triple the shale
reserves of the U.S., and Australia will see the next wave of
the gas revolution as world LNG demand doubles in the next
decade, Voser told delegates at the conference. </p>
<p>Woodside, Australia''s second-biggest oil and gas producer,
said the U.S. is unlikely to grant new natural-gas export
permits until after the presidential election and volumes
eventually shipped may be lower than some predictions. </p>
<h2>U.S. Obstacles </h2>
<p>Some people speculate about numbers up to 100 million
tons per year of liquefied natural gas exports, Chief Executive
Officer Peter Coleman said in an interview at the Kuala Lumpur
conference. I don''t see that. It''s unlikely there will be a lot
of movement on additional expansion until after the election
cycle in the U.S. </p>
<p>Woodside, operator of the A$15 billion ($14.6 billion)
Pluto LNG project in Western Australia, expects the U.S. to
export 30 million to 50 million metric tons of the fuel </p>
<p>In the U.S., you are always going to have constraints with
the need for gas in power generation and the chemicals
industry, Coleman said. That says a lot of gas will
stay in the U.S., he said. Australian LNG has its place. </p>
<p>Benchmark gas prices in the U.S. have slumped to the lowest
in a decade amid a supply glut. </p>
<p>Gas futures slid to $1.90 per million Btu on the New York
Mercantile Exchange April 19, the lowest since September 2001. </p>
<p>Oil prices are unlikely to collapse as they did in 2008
because long-term fundamentals haven''t changed and supply will
struggle to meet a projected increase in global demand,
according to Voser. </p>
<p>U.S. crude futures, which slumped to an eight-month low
near $81 a barrel yesterday, have declined because of concern
over economic growth this year and as geopolitical tension in
producing regions subside, the Shell CEO said. </p>
<h2>Oil Prices </h2>
<p>The softening of the oil price at the moment is a
reflection of some of the geopolitical issues being less
dominant and the lower demand outlook, Voser said. The long-term fundamentals haven''t changed, which means that most
probably, given energy-demand growth in the world in the longer
term, supply will struggle to keep pace. </p>
<p>Oil dropped from a record high of $147.27 a barrel to
$32.40 between July and December 2008 as the global recession
sapped demand. Futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange
tumbled 17 percent last month, the most since December 2008, and
traded today as high as $84.92 a barrel. </p>
<p>We''ve seen a lot of volatility, mainly on the demand
side, Voser said after delivering a keynote address at the
industry gathering. We''ve had some geopolitical dimensions
around the Middle East, in Iran and Syria, following the
political tensions in Libya a year ago, so I think that''s
reflected in the price in the more short to medium term. </p>
<p>Oil traded as high as $110.55 a barrel March 1 on
speculation that international sanctions against Iran threatened
supplies from the world''s fourth-biggest producer. Prices have
since dropped as Iran resumed talks with the West over its
nuclear program while Europe''s debt crisis and China''s slowing
economy damped the outlook for oil demand. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. and Google Inc. (GOOG)''s
Motorola Mobility unit are headed to a trial in a dispute over
royalty rates on the Xbox gaming system and Windows products,
after a judge refused to end the case in Microsoft''s favor. </p>
<p>The dispute revolves around patents owned by Libertyville,
Illinois-based Motorola Mobility that are used in standards that
all electronics, including the Microsoft products, follow for
WiFi and video coding technology. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle declined today
to find that Motorola Mobility breached obligations to license
those patents to Microsoft on fair terms, saying the issue must
be resolved at a November trial. Microsoft is also seeking to
prevent Motorola Mobility from winning a ban on sales or U.S.
imports of the Xbox. </p>
<p>While the court will not at this time set forth a legal
standard with respect to Motorola''s duty to offer its patents in
good faith, it is likely that any analysis of Motorola''s duty
will involve, at least in part, an examination of the intent
behind Motorola''s offers, the judge ruled. </p>
<p>Robart rejected the handset maker''s claim that Microsoft
lost the right to complain by filing suit instead of responding
to early royalty demands. At this stage in the case, he said,
Microsoft hasn''t proven Motorola Mobility acted dishonestly in
making its demands. </p>
<h2>Added Royalties </h2>
<p>Motorola Mobility sent letters to Microsoft with what it
said was a standard demand for a 2.25 percent royalty on the end
price of products that use the inventions, including the Xbox
and Windows products. Microsoft contends that would add as much
as $4 billion in annual royalties, a figure Motorola Mobility
disputes. </p>
<p>Motorola Mobility has acted in good faith and we will
prove that at trial, spokeswoman Jennifer Erickson said in an
e-mail. We are pleased that the court is holding Microsoft to
its word -- to license our essential patents just as the vast
majority of the industry has done. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s entertainment unit that includes Xbox sales
generated $8.9 billion in revenue last year, and the Windows
unit garnered $19 billion, according to Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>The Redmond, Washington-based company is trying to prevent
the U.S. International Trade Commission from blocking imports of
the Xbox from Asia, where it is built. </p>
<p>An ITC judge in April said the Xbox infringed four Motorola
Mobility patents, including three related to industry standards.
The commission is scheduled to announce June 25 whether it will
review the infringement finding, and any exclusion order would
be announced in August. </p>
<h2>Patent Leverage </h2>
<p>This case is about Motorola breaking its promise to make
its standard essential patents available on reasonable terms and
putting the price and availability of consumer technology in
jeopardy, Microsoft Deputy General Counsel David Howard said
in a statement. Today''s decision underscores that Motorola
made a promise to the industry which it now must keep, and we
look forward to the November trial to determine the appropriate
licensing royalty. </p>
<p>Motorola Mobility, which became a Google unit last month,
said that Microsoft refuses to pay royalties on the standard
patents. Motorola Mobility has sued the software maker in the
U.S. and Europe. </p>
<p>Robart has prevented Motorola Mobility from taking action
to ban sales of Microsoft products in Germany. Motorola Mobility
officials had no immediate comment on today''s decision. </p>
<p>The European Union is investigating complaints by Microsoft
and Apple that Motorola Mobility is unfairly using standard-
essential patents to block competition. </p>
<p>The U.S. case is Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) v. Motorola Inc.,
10cv1823, U.S. District Court for the District of Washington
(Seattle). The ITC case is In the Matter of Gaming and
Entertainment Consoles, 337-752, U.S. International Trade
Commission (Washington). </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) has had talks with
private-equity firms including Blackstone Group LP (BX) as the bank
considers options for its commodities trading unit if the
Volcker rule outlaws some activities, according to people
familiar with the discussions. </p>
<p>The firm currently has no plans to sell the business or a
minority stake in it, said one of the people, who asked to
remain anonymous because the talks were private. Mary Claire Delaney, a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman, declined to comment. CNBC
reported earlier today that the New York-based bank is
considering a partial sale of its commodities unit. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s commodities unit, which is run by Colin Bryce and Simon Greenshields, generated about $1.5 billion in
annual revenue over the past two years, Kian Abouhossein, a
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) analyst, estimated in a March note. Morgan
Stanley''s business includes trading in futures contracts and
buying and selling physical commodities. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley rose 5.8 percent to $13.61 at 12:45 p.m. in
New York, its biggest intraday gain since February. The bank''s
shares declined 15 percent this year through yesterday. </p>
<p>The Volcker rule, which seeks to ban proprietary trading at
deposit-taking banks, would impair firms'' ability to provide
commodity-related hedging and financing services as currently
written, Greenshields wrote in a comment letter to regulators in
February. </p>
<h2>Oil Trading </h2>
<p>The 10 largest global investment banks generated about $7
billion from commodities trading each of the last two years,
down from more than $12 billion in 2009 and 2008, according to
data from industry analytics firm Coalition Ltd. Morgan Stanley
has about a 15 percent to 20 percent market share among banks,
Glenn Schorr, a Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) analyst, estimated last
year. </p>
<p>Trading in physical commodities, which includes product
transportation and storage, has become a bigger piece of Morgan
Stanley''s operations as competition in futures trading has
increased, Schorr wrote, citing a meeting with Bryce. Trading in
oil makes up about 45 percent of the business, with gas and
power accounting for 40 percent and metals and agriculture about
15 percent, he wrote. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley bought TransMontaigne Inc., a Denver-based
fuel distributor, in 2006 and owns a minority stake in Heidmar
Holdings LLC, a U.S. oil-tanker business. The bank also owns
electricity facilities in the U.S. and Europe, it said in a
regulatory filing. </p>
<h2>Goldman Sachs </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley doesn''t break out revenue from its
commodities business, which reports within the fixed income and
commodities unit. That business posted $2.6 billion in revenue
in the first quarter, excluding accounting charges, up 34
percent from a year earlier. Colm Kelleher, co-president of the
firm''s institutional securities group, oversees all trading,
including the commodities unit. </p>
<p>Gary Cohn, president and chief operating officer of Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., was asked at an investor conference last week
whether the bank might spin off its commodities business. Cohn
said that while it''s possible, the business benefits from being
part of the global firm. </p>
<p>If you look at our commodities business, many of our most
important clients are our big corporate clients, Cohn said,
adding that there are enormous synergies in Goldman Sachs''s
ability to advise them on investment banking, financing and risk
management. </p>
<p>David Wells, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to
comment. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s largest
drugmaker, plans to sell a minority stake in its animal health
division in an initial stock sale by July 2013. </p>
<p>The unit and its more than 9,000 employees worldwide will
become a stand-alone company called Zoetis, New York-based
Pfizer said today in a statement. The divested business may be
valued from $15 billion to $20 billion, Catherine Arnold, an
analyst with Credit Suisse in New York, said in an April note. </p>
<p>The divestiture of the animal health operations, which sold
$4.18 billion in products for pets and livestock last year, is
part of a three-pronged strategy by Chief Executive Officer Ian Read to refocus the company on developing new pharmaceuticals.
He said in April that the unit would probably be shed in a
combined initial public offering and share swap. </p>
<p>Pfizer Animal Health is a dynamic business with strong
fundamentals, an expanding and loyal direct customer base and a
proven management team, Read said today in the statement.
Our focus continues to be on taking the actions that will
generate the greatest after-tax value for our shareholders. </p>
<p>Pfizer rose less than 1 percent to $21.94 at the close in
New York and has gained 5.8 percent in the past 12 months. The
company previously said that July 2013 was its target to
complete the changeover. </p>
<h2>Nutrition Sale </h2>
<p>Pfizer announced on April 23 that it would sell its infant
nutrition business to Vevey, Switzerland-based Nestle SA (NESN) for
$11.9 billion. Read has also said he is eliminating $1 billion
from costs this year. </p>
<p>Money from the unit divestitures is likely to be used for
more share buybacks, Read has said, calling them the case to
beat compared to acquisitions and dividend payments. Pfizer
has repurchased 2.43 billion shares worth $66.1 billion since
1998, according to a report by John Boris, an analyst with
Citigroup in New York. </p>
<p>Pfizer needs new products as it enters an era without
Lipitor, the cholesterol pill that lost patent protection in
2011 after generating $9.58 billion in revenue that year. The
company doesn''t have a medicine in its pipeline that will
replace all of Lipitor''s sales by itself. Instead, Pfizer is
trying to fill the hole with several products, including two
under review by U.S. regulators for possible approval this year. </p>
<p>Eliquis, a blood thinner developed with Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co., is scheduled to get a ruling from regulators by the
end of this month. Tofacitinib, Pfizer''s anti-arthritis pill, is
scheduled for a decision this summer. </p>
<p>The new name for the company was suggested by the words zoo
and zoology, according to the company statement. </p>
<p>It best captures the company''s focus on partnership with
veterinarians, livestock producers and companion animal
owners, said Juan Ramn Alaix, president of the division. </p>

<p>Song Yu, an economist at Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., comments on China''s decision to lower interest
rates for the first time since 2008. Song gave the comments in a
note today. </p>
<p>We believe the cut is a clear and strong signal to the
market of the loosening policy stance. It reflects the concerns
of the top leadership on slowing economic growth and the
relatively benign view on inflation. </p>
<p>By now, the May data is already compiled, though not
publicly announced. It is likely this data was still be on the
weak side. We still believe May activity data would be
incrementally better than it was in April, but probably is still
deemed to be too weak by senior policymakers. We think the rate
cut could help to alleviate the financial burdens of firms and
boost demand for loans. </p>
<p>We believe interest rates will be cut again later in the
year, likely in the third quarter in 2012. We expect multiple
required reserve-ratio cuts, which can happen at any time. We
reiterate the quantity of liquidity holds the key, and we expect
the monetary authorities to be on the relatively loose side of
policymaking.'''' </p>

<p>Regulators and investors have touted
higher capital ratios as the path for banks to restore
confidence. Morgan Stanley (MS), the best-capitalized Wall Street
firm, is proving that''s not enough. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley has the highest Tier 1 common ratio among
the five largest U.S. investment banks, topping JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM), Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Citigroup Inc. (C) and Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) Still, it faces the largest potential downgrade from
Moody''s Investors Service, has the highest-priced credit-default
swaps and trades at the biggest discount to liquidation value. </p>
<p>The firm''s underperformance highlights Chief Executive
Officer James Gorman''s difficulty convincing investors that his
is a different company than the one that borrowed more than $100
billion from the Federal Reserve to survive in 2008. Morgan
Stanley also faces doubts after JPMorgan, the only U.S. bank
with more credit-default swaps on its balance sheet, announced a
$2 billion loss from derivatives trading. </p>
<p>With the recent surprise with what happened at JPMorgan,
we are all very skeptical of what''s on those balance sheets that
we as outsiders can''t figure out, said Charles Peabody, an
analyst with Portales Partners LLC in New York, who has a
neutral rating on the stock. Morgan Stanley has not proven in
recent history to be good risk managers. </p>
<h2>Three-Level Cut </h2>
<p>Gorman, 53, who has weathered a 53 percent stock-price
plunge since taking over at the start of 2010, has sold
businesses, added liquidity and vowed to increase the bank''s
reliance on steadier wealth management, trying to assuage
concerns that his firm is riskier than rivals. He''s also trying
to convince Moody''s that Morgan Stanley doesn''t deserve the
three-level cut the ratings company said it may make this month. </p>
<p>The maximum downgrade, which would be the largest among
U.S. banks and place the firm''s rating two levels above junk,
may raise borrowing costs and force Morgan Stanley to post more
collateral on trades. It would also threaten a fixed-income
trading turnaround as some counterparties wouldn''t be able to do
derivatives deals with such a low-rated firm. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, owner of the world''s largest brokerage, had
a ratio of Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets of 13.3
percent as of March 31, using Basel 1 standards, the highest of
the five banks. It also may have the highest ratio under not-
yet-implemented Basel 3 rules. Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in April the ratio would have been between 8 percent
and 9 percent, depending on how the Fed assigns some risk
weightings in rules it is writing. </p>
<h2>Capital Ratios </h2>
<p>That may put the bank above JPMorgan''s 8.2 percent Tier 1
common ratio and Goldman Sachs''s 8 percent. Bank of America and
Citigroup have Basel 3 ratios below 7.5 percent. </p>
<p>Moody''s said in its downgrade of German banks this week
that it also considers the ratio of equity to total assets in
addition to risk-weighted regulatory measures. Morgan Stanley''s
ratio was 8 percent at the end of the first quarter, double the
4 percent for German banks that Moody''s criticized as thin. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley fell on June 4 to $12.36, the lowest closing
price since Dec. 2, 2008. It''s trading at 51 percent of tangible
book value, a measure of equity that excludes intangible assets
such as goodwill, below Citigroup''s 53 percent and Bank of
America''s 59 percent. That means investors value the New York-
based bank at about half of what the company estimates would
remain if it sold all assets and retired debt. </p>
<p>Gorman said last month that the share price was
inexplicable. The stock climbed yesterday to $13.94, the
biggest advance since Nov. 30. </p>
<h2>Not Helping'' </h2>
<p>Capital doesn''t seem to be solving all the problems,
said Shannon Stemm, an analyst at Edward Jones  Co. in St.
Louis. Compared with the European banks, a lot of the U.S.
banks look really well-capitalized, yet that''s still not helping
them. They''re still trading at half of book value, just like the
European banks. </p>
<p>Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and former Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman Sheila Bair are among
regulators who have called for higher capital ratios to help
restore confidence in large banks. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley will deploy some of its capital to increase
its investment in a brokerage joint venture. The firm, which has
the option to buy Citigroup''s remaining 49 percent stake in
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney over the next two years, announced
it would buy an additional 14 percent this year. </p>
<p>The need for cash to fund the purchase has led some
investors to discount the firm''s high capital ratios, said David Konrad, an analyst at KBW Inc. (KBW) in New York. </p>
<h2>Un-Investible'' Stocks </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley and its competitors have faced declining
trading volumes and low merger activity as investors and
companies remain wary about the European debt crisis and the
U.S. economy. David Trone, an analyst at JMP Securities LLC in
New York, downgraded all five banks to market underperform on
May 21, declaring them un-investible because of
macroeconomic threats. </p>
<p>Still, Morgan Stanley''s 7.9 percent share-price decline
this year is more than JPMorgan''s 0.5 percent drop, while Bank
of America, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs have climbed. The shares
fell even though Morgan Stanley had the largest trading-revenue
increase in the first quarter, leading Konrad to say it had the
best quarter of the five banks. </p>
<p>It becomes very difficult at small fractions of book
value to make any kind of a fundamental call, because the stock
is trading as if the firm''s under severe duress, and the reality
is it''s not, said Roger Freeman, an analyst at Barclays Plc (BARC)''s
investment bank in New York. Part of it is just institutional
memory. They were viewed as in a relatively weak position then,
and I think they''re viewed that way now and don''t get credit for
all the changes they''ve made. </p>
<h2>Moody''s Downgrade </h2>
<p>Those changes may not preclude a bigger cut from Moody''s
than Bear Stearns Cos. received the week before it collapsed and
was sold to JPMorgan in March 2008. That would bring its rating
to Baa2, five levels below where it was at the end of 2007, when
its leverage was more than double its current level. </p>
<p>Moody''s said in February that current ratings don''t capture
challenges facing investment banks, including a more difficult
operating environment, fragile funding conditions and greater
regulation. Abbas Qasim, a Moody''s spokesman in New York,
declined to comment beyond the firm''s reports. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley has cited its capital ratios in trying to
convince Moody''s that it doesn''t deserve a three-level cut,
according to a person briefed on the discussions. Gorman and
Porat are among bank executives who have attended about half a
dozen meetings with the ratings company since the review was
announced, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because the meetings were private. </p>
<h2>Better Shape'' </h2>
<p>We''re saying to them we''re actually in much, much better
shape than perhaps was understood by the marketplace and the
ratings agencies, Gorman said in a CNBC interview last week.
The kind of company we are now from a few years ago is very,
very different, and part of the discovery process with Moody''s
is to share that information. </p>
<p>Mary Claire Delaney, a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley,
declined to make Gorman available for comment. </p>
<p>The maximum cut would place Morgan Stanley at its lowest
rating ever and at least two levels below Goldman Sachs, its
closest U.S. competitor. Goldman Sachs generated 75 percent of
its revenue last year from capital-markets businesses, the
inherent vulnerabilities of which Moody''s said in February
prompted the industrywide review. That''s higher than Morgan
Stanley''s 53 percent. </p>
<h2>Risk Management </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s risk management did not perform as well
during the crisis as Moody''s had anticipated, said the ratings
firm, which cited Goldman Sachs''s strong track record. </p>
<p>In the fourth quarter of 2007, Morgan Stanley posted $9
billion of writedowns, largely tied to proprietary trading in
mortgage-related products. In 2008, it faced a liquidity crunch
as clients pulled funds from its prime brokerage and had to rely
on Fed borrowing to survive. At the peak, on Sept. 29, the firm
owed the central bank $107.3 billion, an amount greater than its
total liquidity of $99.8 billion. </p>
<p>Since then, Morgan Stanley has taken writedowns as it
exited investments in hedge fund FrontPoint Partners LLC,
mortgage-servicing firm Saxon Capital Inc. and Atlantic City,
New Jersey-based casino operator Revel Entertainment Group LLC,
as well as posting a $1.7 billion loss in the fourth quarter to
close out contracts with bond insurer MBIA Inc. (MBI) </p>
<h2>No Mistakes </h2>
<p>Gorman has vowed to make no new mistakes. The bank has
increased the size of its risk-management operation to about 500
people, from about 300 at the start of 2009. It also has added a
risk committee to the board of directors, headed by former U.K.
Financial Services Authority Chairman Howard Davies, and
developed a new internal stress-testing model. </p>
<p>Moody''s said in a Feb. 17 credit opinion that Morgan
Stanley faces the challenge of sustaining improvements it has
made in risk management in the face of demands for higher
returns. The bank posted a 4 percent return on equity last year,
below Gorman''s goal of 15 percent. Investors also need further
proof that firm''s new leadership won''t repeat the mistakes of
the 2008 crisis, said Stemm of Edward Jones. </p>
<p>They need a couple quarters of consistently demonstrating
they can operate and be profitable in a difficult environment,
Stemm said. Last year, they didn''t quite build that track
record because they were dealing with so many legacy issues. So
I don''t think investors feel they have that consistency yet. </p>
<h2>Decision Delayed </h2>
<p>Moody''s gave guidance in February on how many levels it
could cut each of the banks, something it didn''t do when it
placed Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) on
review last year. It ended up cutting Bank of America two
grades, Wells Fargo one level and affirming Citigroup''s rating. </p>
<p>The ratings firm also delayed its decision, saying it will
complete the review, previously scheduled for mid-May, by the
end of June. The uncertainty has hurt banks'' spreads and stock
prices, said Douglas Ciocca, CEO of Kavar Capital Partners LLC
in Leawood, Kansas. </p>
<p>The cost to protect Morgan Stanley debt for five years has
jumped 28 percent to 414 basis points since Moody''s announced
its review Feb. 15, leaving the firm''s protection more than 100
basis points costlier than any of the other investment banks.
Goldman Sachs''s credit-default swaps trade at 312 basis points,
while JPMorgan''s cost 160 basis points. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point. </p>
<p>Left to their own devices, the markets tend to over-
account for things, said Ciocca, whose firm manages about $225
million in assets, including bank debt and equity. It''s like
my mom used to send me and my brother to our room when we did
something wrong and wait for our dad to get home. The longer it
took for him to arrive, the more certain we became of how severe
the punishment was going to be. </p>
<h2>Downgrade Odds </h2>
<p>John Guarnera, an analyst at Societe Generale SA in New
York, said there''s a 60 percent chance Moody''s will downgrade
Morgan Stanley three levels and a 40 percent probability of a
two-grade cut. Donald Jones, a credit analyst at Sterne Agee 
Leach Inc., estimated last month that the chance of a two-grade
cut is 75 percent. </p>
<p>Moody''s decision to provide specific guidance about
potential downgrades of 17 of the world''s biggest banks was the
result of investor demands for more transparency amid a volatile
European crisis, which helped prompt the delay, said David Hendler, an analyst at CreditSights Inc. in New York. </p>
<p>Now investors and the companies rated are saying, Get it
over with already,'' Hendler said. Some investors are upset
with ratings agencies because they rated banks too highly during
the crisis, and then, after they rebuilt their balance sheets
two-to three-times stronger in capital and liquidity, now you
want to ding them, he said. </p>

<p>Trades by JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s
London-based chief investment office have raised the cost of
hedging debt of companies from ATT Inc. (T) to CenturyLink Inc. (CTL) and
Dell Inc. (DELL) </p>
<p>After JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said
during a May 10 conference call with analysts and investors that
the bank had a $2 billion trading loss in credit derivatives,
the 10-year Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index
Series 9, created in 2007 and speculated to be one of the
biggest positions contributing to the loss, has surged 21 basis
points relative to the current most-active index, the five-year
Series 18. </p>
<p>The technical effect of the so-called IG9 index''s surge has
pushed credit-default swaps on the index''s constituents wider,
including ATT, CenturyLink and Dell''s five-year contracts,
according to Hale Holden, a Barclays Plc strategist. </p>
<p>While further normalization in IG9 positioning could take
these credits even wider in the near term, they stand to benefit
when technicals abate and fundamental relative value reasserts
itself, Barclays strategists Shobhit Gupta and Eric Gross
wrote in a note dated today. </p>
<p>Bloomberg News reported in April that JPMorgan trader Bruno Iksil had amassed positions linked to the financial health of
corporations that were so large he was driving price moves in
the $10 trillion swap-index market, earning him the nickname the
London Whale among some counterparties, according to market
participants who asked not to be identified because they aren''t
authorized to discuss the trades. </p>
<h2>Against Bruno'' </h2>
<p>The jump in the index, fueled by the size of the JPMorgan
trades relative to the market''s liquidity, has been exacerbated
by traders anticipating an unwinding of the positions. </p>
<p>The distortion in the indexes and the individual-company
swaps is caused by JPMorgan or people trading against Bruno,
Bonnie Baha, head of global developed credit at DoubleLine
Capital LP in Los Angeles, which oversees $35 billion, said in a
telephone interview. </p>
<p>Dimon declined on the conference call to discuss specific
transactions or people involved.  Credit-default swaps pay the
buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations,
less the value of the defaulted debt. JPMorgan used the
instruments to hedge exposure on loans and other credit risks
tied to corporations, banks and sovereign governments. The
losses emerged after the firm tried to reduce that position,
Dimon said. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Volkswagen
AG (VOW) are leading companies selling $2.6 billion in bonds tied to
household and business borrowing as this year''s issuance
outpaces 2011. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, plans to sell
$750 million of bonds tied to credit-card debt set to mature in
five years. The securities are rated AAA by Standard  Poor''s
and Fitch Ratings, according to a person familiar with the
transaction who declined to be identified because terms aren''t
set. The New York-based bank is managing the sale, with HSBC
Holdings Plc and Royal Bank of Canada, according to a regulatory
filing. Justin Perras, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to immediately comment. </p>
<p>Companies have sold about $92 billion of asset-backed bonds
tied to consumer and business lending this year, compared with
$87 billion in the first six months of 2011, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Debt tied to credit-card sales account
for $11 billion of 2012 issuance, compared with $45 for
automobile debt and $7 billion for notes backed by student
loans, the data show. </p>
<p>Investors are demanding 61 basis points more yield than on
Treasuries to hold top-ranked asset-backed securities linked to
everything from auto loans to timeshare payments, according to a
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. The spread is down from 93
basis points at the end of last year. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point. </p>
<h2>Spreads Narrow </h2>
<p>Top-ranked debt backed by auto loans is yielding 56 basis
points more than Treasuries, down from 65 basis points on May
15, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. The
securities returned 0.07 percent in May. That compares with 0.33
percent for bonds tied to credit-card payments and 0.58 percent
for investment-grade corporate bonds, index data show. </p>
<p>Volkswagen, based in Wolfsburg, Germany, plans to sell a 1
billion euro ($1.25 billion) lease bond, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The deal, run by JPMorgan and Royal Bank
of Scotland Plc, may be all fixed-rate securities graded AAA by
SP and Fitch with a 1.5 percent yield, according to a person
familiar with offering who declined to be identified because
terms aren''t set. </p>
<p>CNH Global NV (CNH), the part-owned unit of truck and tractor
manufacturer Fiat Industrial SpA, is planning to sell $750
million of bonds backed by loans for equipment. The deal is run
by Credit Suisse AG, Credit Agricole SA and RBS. </p>
<h2>Stable'' Outlook </h2>
<p>The Amsterdam-based company sold $996 million of equipment
bonds in March and $811 million in December. </p>
<p>SP boosted CNH''s outlook to stable in March, citing
better-than-expected 2011 financial results, and that Fiat
Industrial''s diversification should offset weaker truck
sales in Southern Europe. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is also planning to sell a conduit bond, according
to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,
backed by loans including California''s Palazzo Westwood Village;
Doubletree Corp.''s Wit Hotel in Chicago; 100 West Putnam in
Greenwich, Connecticut; Louisville, Kentucky''s Jefferson Mall;
and Southpark Mall in Colonial Heights, Virginia. </p>
<p>Moody''s Investors Service said last week the gap is
widening between strong shopping centers that can attract
tenants and those that may be on a path toward liquidation amid
sluggish economic growth. Moody''s is changing how it
assesses the weakest shopping-mall loans packaged into
commercial-mortgage bonds to compensate for a growing number of
properties that may struggle to survive. </p>
<p>SolarCity Corp., the developer of rooftop solar power
systems that is working on its initial public offering, plans to
use solar panel installations on Wal-Mart Stores Inc. in
Arizona, California, Colorado, and 150 leases in pipeline as
collateral for first securitization, Asset-Backed Alert reported
last week. The San Mateo, California-based company may have $3
billion of commercial, residential solar-equipment leases ready
to securitize by year-end 2015. The size and timing haven''t been
determined. </p>

<p>General Electric Co. (GE) will invest
$900 million in aviation, energy, health, transportation and
infrastructure in Turkey over the next three years after the
government offered incentives to investors. </p>
<p>The investment package will include production of wind
energy equipment, Economy Minister Zafer Caglayan said today at
a press conference in Istanbul. </p>
<p>We have not announced specifics of the investment which
will be defined over time and until then we have no further
details to add, the company said in an emailed statement. </p>
<p>The plan has a focus on infrastructure and innovation,
GE Vice Chairman John Rice told reporters. The company will
provide specifics in the next couple of months and is in
talks with universities on plans for research and development,
he said. </p>
<p>GE also set up a strategic partnership with state-run
locomotive manufacturer Turkiye Lokomotif  Motor Sanayi AS,
known as Tulomsas, in 2008 and expect its exports to be $1.5
billion over next 10 years, the company said in a statement
handed to reporters. </p>
<p>Caglayan said GE will boost its cooperation in railway
transportation business. </p>
<p>The Fairfield, Connecticut-based company, which sold an
18.6 percent stake in Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) to Spain''s
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA) SA for $3.78 billion in 2010,
has a 46 percent stake in Turkish Aerospace Industries, the
Ankara-based maker of aircraft parts known as Tusas, and owns
half of Gama Enerji AS, a Turkish power producer, among its six
units with 600 employees in Turkey. The U.S. company also makes
health-care measurement and imaging devices, lighting equipment
and power turbines. </p>
<h2>Energy Demand </h2>
<p>Turkey''s electricity demand is increasing about 6 percent
annually, compared with a government economic growth forecast of
4 percent, Caglayan said. It''s only logical for an energy
giant like GE to invest in Turkey''s energy, he said. </p>
<p>GE, founded in the late 19th century by Thomas Edison, is
one of the oldest major companies in the U.S. It''s the world''s
biggest maker of diesel locomotives and airplane engines. </p>
<p>Local unit General Elektrik Ticaret  Servis AS may start
manufacturing wind turbines and parts, with half the output
likely to be sold within Turkey as the government targets a 20-
fold increase in wind capacity by 2020, Mete Maltepe, head of
GE''s local energy unit, said in an interview in 2010. </p>
<p>GE will benefit from a wide-ranging package of incentives
offered to investors to boost local production as a way to
narrow the country''s current account deficit, Caglayan said. </p>
<p>Turkey is looking to spur investment in industries that
rely on imports to produce their goods to help narrow a current-
account gap of about nine percent of its $772 billion gross
domestic product, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said April
5. The government is focusing its efforts on industries
including defense, automotive, rail and sea transport,
pharmaceuticals, education, tourism and mining, Caglayan''s
economy ministry said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) predicted a
29 percent return over the next year from the Standard  Poor''s
GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index, led by energy and industrial-
metals investments. </p>
<p>European policy makers will be able to contain the euro-area
debt crisis, while recovery in the U.S. and China is set to
continue, Jeffrey Currie, head of commodities research in New
York, said today in a report. Returns may be 41 percent in a
year for energy investments, compared with 23 percent for
industrial metals and 18 percent for precious metals, while
agriculture is forecast to lose 14 percent, the report showed. </p>
<p>Although the macroeconomic backdrop still remains
uncertain, particularly in Europe, we believe that the selloff
in commodity prices is likely overdone and the price risks are
shifting more to the upside, Currie wrote. </p>
<p>Commodities as measured by the SP GSCI Enhanced Commodity
Index dropped 13 percent in May and are down 9.1 percent this
year on mounting concern that Europe''s widening debt crisis will
derail global growth and curb demand for commodities. Coffee,
natural gas, cotton and crude oil paced declines. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs cut its three-month outlook on commodities to
neutral from overweight on March 28, while sticking with an
overweight recommendation for a one-year period. Commodities may
return 13 percent in a year, the bank said in April. </p>
<p>Currie correctly advised investors to reduce commodity
holdings on April 15, 2011, before prices slumped 6.9 percent in
May, the first monthly drop in eight. On March 29, 2011, Currie
said commodities may rise more than estimated 14.3 percent in 12
months. Goldman in December closed its recommendations to buy
the June 2012 copper at a loss of $1,530 a metric ton and the
December 2012 zinc at $298 a ton. Only two out of seven
Goldman''s trading recommendations are currently making a profit. </p>
<h2>Copper, Gold </h2>
<p>Crude, gas, copper, aluminum and gold are the bank''s top
picks, according to the latest report. Copper stockpiles are
declining, especially in leading global consumer China, and the
oil market is tightening, Currie wrote. </p>
<p>Still, Goldman Sachs lowered three-month price forecasts to
$8,000 a ton from $9,000 for copper and to $2,200 a ton from
$2,400 for aluminum, according to a separate report today.
Copper for three-month delivery gained 1.4 percent to $7,393.25
a ton by 3:20 p.m. on the London Metal Exchange and aluminum was
little changed at $1,974 a ton. </p>
<p>Speculators cut combined bullish bets across the SP GSCI
index by 13 percent to this year''s lowest level in the week
ended June 5, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show.
Hedge-fund bets on declines in copper futures are the highest
since March 2009, according to the CFTC. </p>
<p>The financial participation in many markets is now below
what is consistent with the underlying market fundamentals,
Currie wrote. Physical deleveraging has been an ongoing
process, particularly in Europe since the fourth quarter of last
year, as funding costs remain high. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, is in talks to sell its hedge-fund
administration unit to State Street Corp. (STT), according to a person
with knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>A final agreement is yet to be reached, said the person,
who declined to be identified because the negotiations are
private. The unit provides fund accounting, valuation and risk-
management for hedge funds. </p>
<p>Regulators including the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission have increased oversight of companies that do
business with hedge funds in response to convicted fraudster
Bernard Madoff''s Ponzi scheme and industry losses in 2008.
State Street, the third-biggest custody bank, added $170 billion
of hedge-fund and private-equity assets when it bought Mourant
International Finance Administration, based in Jersey in the
Channel Islands, in December 2009. </p>
<p>This is a sensible move for Goldman Sachs in getting out
of this largely unglamorous business, in which increased
regulation and oversight from SEC has put additional risk on the
administrator without necessarily generating the commensurate
revenues, said Christopher Wheeler, analyst with Mediobanca
SpA in London. Such sales have become a common practice for
U.S. banks since the Madoff scandal, following a similar trend
in Europe. </p>
<p>State Street had $506 billion in hedge-fund assets under
administration at the end of March, the Boston-based company
said in an April 30 presentation. </p>
<p>As a matter of policy, we don''t comment on rumor or
speculation, Hannah Grove, a State Street spokeswoman, said in
an e-mail. A Goldman Sachs spokeswoman in London declined to
comment. </p>
<p>The combined business would have about $700 billion in
assets, according to the Financial Times, which reported the
talks earlier today. </p>

<p>As JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) began to
plot its Washington damage control strategy in the wake of last
month''s $2 billion trading loss, the bank realized it needed
some help with Republicans. </p>
<p>Although traditionally sympathetic to Wall Street,
Republican lawmakers in both the House and Senate not only
weren''t rushing to JPMorgan''s defense, some were agitating for
congressional hearings and investigations. Republican aides
acknowledged privately that lawmakers were enjoying that Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon -- a Democrat once known as
President Barack Obama''s favorite banker -- was having a
comeuppance. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s government relations unit countered quickly: Mel Martinez, a former Republican senator who is a regional chairman
for the bank, was called up from Florida to talk with some old
colleagues. Nate Gatten, a former Fannie Mae lobbyist who works
in JPMorgan''s London office, flew back to Washington and checked
into a hotel for an extended stay. </p>
<p>They jumped in to the fray, as the bank fielded some 150
inquiries from congressional offices and agencies. The team
includes several other Republicans and prominent Democrats, like
the head of JPMorgan''s Washington office, Naomi Camper, a former
senior staff member for Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim
Johnson, and Peter Scher, a former Clinton administration
official, who oversees government relations globally. </p>
<h2>First Sign </h2>
<p>Dimon''s testimony before the Senate Banking Committee
tomorrow will be the first sign of whether JPMorgan''s efforts
have been effective in tamping down the political firestorm set
off by the trading flap. Unlike other large banks who tend to
hire high-powered consultants and spin doctors when faced with a
crisis, JPMorgan is relying mostly on its own in-house team
which Dimon has been building up over the past four years. </p>
<p>We wanted to take ownership of this and use our own
people, Scher said in an interview. We knew that the
concerns and questions were for us alone. </p>
<p>JPMorgan did hire one outside firm, the BennettGroup, run
by ex-Utah Republican Senator Robert F. Bennett. While Bennett
is still barred from lobbying, the bank has been using P.
Michael Nielsen, a Republican former senior policy adviser on
the Senate Banking Committee, to help answer lawmaker queries. </p>
<p>There is much at stake for JPMorgan. The trading debacle
has cost the bank some $27 billion in market value and dented
Dimon''s reputation as the banking executive who most
successfully navigated the 2008 financial crisis. </p>
<p>The heightened scrutiny of the bank has reverberated
throughout the financial industry as regulatory agencies like
the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission
take a new look at tightening regulations like the so-called
Volcker rule banning proprietary trading. Even more broadly,
some argue lawmakers may need to look at new ways to rein in the
largest banks. </p>
<h2>Mega Banks </h2>
<p>When the best managed, best led bank in the world can
have this kind of blunder happen, it just confirms no matter how
good your management is, no matter how tightly you try to
regulate and oversee these mega banks, they are just too big to
get your arms around, said Camden Fine, president of the
Independent Community Bankers of America, a small bank trade
group. This is something that the Hill will have to grapple
with. </p>
<p>Wall Street has a vested interest in the outcome,
particularly in preventing the furor from convincing regulators
to tighten the Volcker rule, which could limit the kind of
proprietary trading at issue. As a result, JPMorgan''s large bank
competitors haven''t moved to take advantage of its troubles.
Some are even helping them strategize about how to deal with the
controversy. </p>
<h2>Goldman Assists </h2>
<p>That includes Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), usually one of
JPMorgan''s fiercest competitors. According to people with
knowledge of the situation, several of Goldman Sachs'' Washington
lobbyists have been brainstorming with their JPMorgan
counterparts on tactics and messages. One piece of advice: Pull
the Band-Aid off fast and explain in as much detail as possible
what happened, the people said. </p>
<p>That comes from experience. Goldman was in a similar
situation two years ago when its CEO, Lloyd Blankfein, was
summoned before a Senate panel to discuss the firm''s role in
fueling the subprime loan crisis. </p>
<p>Blankfein, though contrite at times, didn''t win many
plaudits for his testimony, which often relied on technical
definitions of market making to explain why the bank was on the
other side of a trade from its clients. Those answers so angered
Senator Carl Levin that the Michigan Democrat accused Blankfein
of misleading Congress. </p>
<h2>Franchise Protection'' </h2>
<p>Much of the work JPMorgan is doing these days to explain
the loss isn''t considered lobbying in the traditional sense.
They aren''t pushing for legislation or weighing in with
regulators on the issues. Instead, the bank is in what lobbyists
call a franchise protection mode: trying to push its story
about what happened and pave the way for a smooth hearing for
their CEO. </p>
<p>One of the bank''s key arguments to lawmakers and Obama
administration officials has been that the trading loss, while
large, is not close to being an event that could shake the
financial system or even imperil the bank. While JPMorgan and
its shareholders are feeling pain, they stress, no taxpayer
funds are on the hook. </p>
<p>In private conversations with lawmakers and staff, the bank
has fielded questions about deposits, emphasizing that customer
deposits were never in jeopardy. The bank is also reminding them
that there was plenty of capital to cover this type of loss. </p>
<p>The bank''s Washington office has also been warning
lawmakers and staff that Dimon may not be able to provide
answers to all their questions. JPMorgan reports earnings in
mid-July, so Dimon won''t be able to speculate on the eventual
extent of the losses. The bank has said the tally was at least
$2 billion and could grow. There is also an internal review
under way. </p>
<p>This is not an issue you lobby on, said Scher. There
are legitimate questions from members of Congress and agencies,
and our strategy has been to be as open and as responsive as we
can be. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is leading
banks preparing bond offerings tied to commercial property loans
as Wall Street seeks to offload mortgages stockpiled during the
past two months. </p>
<p>The lender will issue securities linked to debt ranging
from a DoubleTree by Hilton hotel in Queens, New York to a mall
in Louisville, Kentucky, according to a regulatory filing.
Morgan Stanley (MS), Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Barclays Plc (BARC) and UBS AG (UBSN)
are also planning sales, according to people familiar with the
offerings who declined to be identified because the deals
haven''t been announced. JPMorgan''s transaction may be marketed
as soon as next week, the people said. Spokesmen for the banks
declined to comment. </p>
<p>Wall Street banks have been challenged by price swings of
the debt as Europe''s fiscal imbalances fuel volatility, making
it hard to offer property owners consistent terms. The extra
yield investors demand to own top-ranked commercial-mortgage
bonds instead of Treasuries soared to 210 basis points, the
highest in more than three months, on June 4, according to a
Barclays index. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. </p>
<p>For the CMBS market to be fully functional as a first
choice for borrowers, we need to get to a point where there is
more consistency in the terms that originators can offer and
deliver, Scott Singer, a principal at the Singer  Bassuk
Organization LLC, a real-estate firm that represents property
owners and developers arranging financing, said in an interview
last month. </p>
<h2>Profit Margins </h2>
<p>Wider spreads can eat into profit margins on commercial-
mortgage bond offerings, hindering new lending and choking off
funding to borrowers with loans coming due. More than $30
billion in the debt matures this year, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Wells Fargo  Co. sold
top-ranked debt maturing in about 10 years to yield 140 basis
points more than the benchmark swap last week. In April, the
spread on similar newly issued debt was 115 basis points,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Banks have arranged about $11 billion of the deals this
year, compared with $28 billion in all of 2011, Bloomberg data
show. </p>
<p>Sales of commercial-mortgage bonds reached a record $232
billion in 2007, helping fuel a boom in property prices,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Issuance plummeted to
$12.2 billion in 2008 as souring subprime-home loans infected
credit markets. The market stayed shut until November 2009,
choking off funding to borrowers with debt coming due. Banks

<p>Procter  Gamble Co. (PG), the world''s
largest consumer-products company, should consider breaking
itself up if it doesn''t improve earnings this year, an analyst
at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. said today. </p>
<p>Procter  Gamble, based in Cincinnati, would have a market
value of as much as $208 billion in a breakup based on 2013
earnings estimates, according to analyst Ali Dibadj''s sum-of-
parts analysis. The company has a current market value of about
$171 billion. A split would improve focus within the separate
units, wrote Dibadj, a New York-based analyst at Sanford
Bernstein. </p>
<p>Procter  Gamble, led by Chief Executive Officer Robert McDonald, said in May it would pull back on spending in emerging
markets to focus on larger regions, where it has lost market
share. The company will gain $10 billion in cost cuts and
savings through 2016, Procter  Gamble said in February. </p>
<p>While Procter  Gamble now has an appropriate strategy,
the company hasn''t been successful, Dibadj said in a
telephone interview. </p>
<p>The lack of success may be related to the fact that the
cost cuts were just announced, or to Procter  Gamble''s
management or the macro environment, Dibadj said. It could
also be related to the fact that this company is just too
complex, he said. </p>
<p>We believe the size and scale of our business offers
competitive advantages and unique opportunities to win now and
into the future, Paul Fox, a spokesman for Procter  Gamble,
said via e-mail. </p>
<h2>Lost Share'' </h2>
<p>The maker of Tide washing detergent, Ivory soap and Bounty
paper towels may gain more by accelerating sales within
operating units and achieve greater focus in a split than it
would lose in efficiencies, Dibadj said in the note. In the
short term, Procter  Gamble''s strategy to enter emerging
markets, reduce prices and free up cash for investments may help
right the ship, Dibadj wrote. </p>
<p>McDonald, who took over almost three years ago, had
previously laid out a growth plan of adding product categories
and markets to help the company expand to 5 billion customers by
2015. </p>
<p>Investors may lose patience with McDonald if Procter 
Gamble doesn''t show improvement next year, Dibadj said in the
interview. </p>
<p>The company has lost share, missed commitments to the
street, missed commitments internally, and is in a much worse
place than I think any of us would have anticipated, Dibadj
said. Can you hoist that blame just on one person? No, but
there''s always one person who''s ultimately responsible. </p>
<p>The company''s current fiscal year ends June 30. </p>
<p>Procter  Gamble fell 0.3 percent to $62.57 at the close in
New York. The shares have declined 6.2 percent this year. </p>

<p>Chevron Phillips Chemical Co. said
it''s on schedule to build one of the first new U.S. ethylene
plants in more than a decade, taking advantage of cheap natural
gas and gaining an edge in avoiding a potential labor shortage. </p>
<p>Chevron Phillips will need about 10,000 engineers and
construction workers to build a new ethylene plant and two
polyethylene factories outside Houston, and another 400 workers
to operate them when they open in 2017, Chief Executive Officer
Peter Cella said today in an interview at the company''s  Cedar
Bayou facility in Baytown, Texas. </p>
<p>Chevron Phillips is racing competitors such as Dow Chemical
Co. (DOW) and Exxon Mobil Corp. to complete the factories in southeast
Texas as gas production from shale rock makes raw materials from
the U.S. among the cheapest globally. With so much production
capacity planned, Cella anticipates a dearth of skilled labor in
the region. </p>
<p>We are first out of the gate, Cella said. I think
that will serve us well if the set of circumstances comes about
that there is a tight labor market. </p>
<p>Cella broke ground today on another Cedar Bayou facility,
which will make 1-hexene, an ethylene-derived ingredient in
polyethylene plastic. It will be the world''s largest, capable of
producing as much as 250,000 metric tons (551 million pounds) a
year, the company said. Construction started in April and is
scheduled to be complete in the first quarter of 2014. </p>
<h2>Rising Demand </h2>
<p>Rising U.S. demand for plastics and other ethylene
derivatives may support three or four new projects over the next
decade, Cella said. Any additional capacity would be used to
boost exports to South America and Asia, from about 15 percent
to 20 percent of U.S. ethylene production now, he said. </p>
<p>Thanks to the development of this new resource base
previously locked up in shale rock, there is a new optimism that
has spread across the entire chemical industry,'' Cella said at
the ceremony. I do see a resurgence in our industry. </p>
<p>Chevron Phillips is spending about $5 billion on the
ethylene and polyethylene plants and Cella wouldn''t disclose the
price of the hexene project. </p>
<p>The company also plans to increase production capacity by
20 percent in February at its gas fractionation plant in Sweeny,
Texas. The plant separates natural gas liquids such as ethane
and propane for use by chemical makers and other customers. </p>
<p>LyondellBasell Industries NV (LYB) opened the last U.S. ethylene
plant in 2001 in Channelview, Texas. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) named Leo Civitillo
and Claus Skrumsager as global co-heads of fixed-income
underwriting, three months after the U.S. leader of the unit was
arrested, according to a person briefed on the decision. </p>
<p>Civitillo and Skrumsager will report to Raj Dhanda, head of
global capital markets at the New York-based bank, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the appointments
weren''t made public. </p>
<p>William Bryan Jennings, Morgan Stanley''s U.S. bond-
underwriting chief, was arrested in February, accused of
stabbing a New York cab driver over a fare. He pleaded not
guilty March 9. The company said that month that Jennings has
been put on leave. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s fixed-income underwriting business
generated $1.36 billion in revenue last year, 32 percent of the
company''s investment-banking total. Issuance of global corporate
bonds has dropped 3.3 percent this year from the same period in
2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Morgan Stanley is
the eighth-ranked underwriter, down from fifth in 2011 and
seventh in 2010. </p>
<p>Helen Meates, previously the chief operating officer of
global capital markets, will become deputy head of the business,
the person said. Daniel Palmer, the firm''s global head of
corporate equity derivatives, will add the role of vice chairman
of capital markets, the person said. </p>
<p>Civitillo was previously co-head of fixed-income
underwriting in the Americas with Jennings, and Skrumsager led
the business in Europe. The debt-capital-markets unit previously
didn''t have global heads. </p>
<p>Skrumsager and Civitillo were also named global co-chiefs
of debt derivatives in October. Skrumsager, based in London, was
hired by Morgan Stanley from HSBC Holdings Plc in 2007.
Civitillo joined the firm in 2004 from JPMorgan Chase  Co. </p>
<p>Jennings was charged with assault and a hate crime, which
each brings a maximum sentence of five years in prison. He was
also charged with not paying the fare, a misdemeanor. </p>

<p>Lloyd C. Blankfein, chairman and
chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) for the past
six years, said it''s a tough job to leave and he''s unlikely
to follow his predecessors into government. </p>
<p>When you think of my last five or six predecessors, five
of them left because they went to the government, he told
reporters after participating in a discussion at the Chicago
Club. I would say the government isn''t going to call me up. So
that means staying forever or dying at my desk. </p>
<p>Blankfein, 57, was named to his current job in June 2006 to
succeed Henry Paulson, who was nominated to serve as President
George W. Bush''s Treasury Secretary. During Blankfein''s tenure,
New York-based Goldman Sachs generated the highest profits in
its history and also the biggest losses since becoming a public
company in 1999. </p>
<p>I''ll tell you why this is a tough job to leave,
Blankfein said. When things are going really well it''s the
best job in the world and you wouldn''t want to leave. And when
things are going badly you can''t leave because your sense of
responsibility won''t let you. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs converted to a bank in the aftermath of the
2008 financial crisis. The firm paid $550 million to settle a
Securities and Exchange Commission claim that it misled
investors in a 2007 mortgage-linked security, and the Senate''s
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations accused the company of
misleading investors. </p>
<h2>Corzine, Rubin </h2>
<p>Before Paulson, leaders of the firm included Jon Corzine,
who became a U.S. senator and New Jersey governor; Stephen Friedman, who served as director of the National Economic
Council; Robert Rubin, Treasury secretary under President Bill
Clinton; John C. Whitehead, deputy secretary of state; and John L. Weinberg, who stepped down as senior partner and chairman in
1990 and died in 2006. </p>
<p>I don''t know, Blankfein said about when he''ll decide to
leave. People who''ve done this don''t know their mood until
their mood switches. </p>
<p>Gustave Levy, who preceded Weinberg and Whitehead, was
running the firm when he collapsed and died in 1976. Weinberg''s
father, Sidney Weinberg, remained involved in the firm until his
own death in 1969, according to Bill Cohan, author of Money
and Power: How Goldman Sachs Came to Rule the World, and a
Bloomberg View columnist. </p>
<p>Blankfein made his comments at the Chicago Club, where he
participated in a discussion with Motorola Solutions Inc.
Chairman and CEO Greg Brown. Goldman Sachs is the fifth-largest
U.S. bank by assets. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief
Financial Officer David A. Viniar expects that Moody''s Investors
Service''s pending downgrades of major U.S. banks will have a
muted impact on the companies, according to an analyst. </p>
<p>Chris Kotowski at Oppenheimer  Co. in New York published a
research note describing a meeting he held yesterday with Viniar
and Stephen M. Scherr, Goldman Sachs''s head of financing and
Latin America. </p>
<p>Viniar, 56, said the downgrades had been totally
telegraphed'' (i.e. priced in) and because it was the whole
industry would have a muted impact, Kotowski wrote.
Financial institutions are major issuers of debt,
institutional investors need to buy it and anyone who was not
aware of the downgrades was probably in the wrong business. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and
Citigroup Inc. (C) are among companies that may be downgraded by two
levels, Moody''s said in a statement in February, adding that the
guidance is indicative only. Morgan Stanley (MS), Credit Suisse
Group AG (CSGN) and UBS AG (UBSN) could be lowered by as much as three
notches, Moody''s said. </p>
<p>Viniar and James Gorman, Morgan Stanley''s chief executive
officer, are among Wall Street executives who have publicly
questioned Moody''s analysis. Gorman said yesterday at an
investor conference in New York that a three-level cut of Morgan
Stanley''s rating would be somewhat stunning given the firm''s
increased capital. </p>
<h2>Macro Hedges </h2>
<p>Kotowski''s note said he also asked whether Goldman Sachs
uses global macro hedges to manage its risk. JPMorgan Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon is testifying today in the Senate
about his bank''s trading loss on derivatives that the firm has
described as designed to help offset, or hedge, the company''s
credit risks. </p>
<p>Viniar''s response was that essentially they don''t use
them, Kotowski wrote. Philosophically they believe that risk
management should be done in the business unit, not centralized.
The business needs to own the risk, and his role as CFO is to
set limits on it. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) hired Duane Masucci, Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)''s head of distressed sourcing,
according to four people with knowledge of the move. </p>
<p>Masucci, 45, will be a so-called sourcer at Goldman Sachs,
someone who locates and purchases distressed loans, bonds or
claims for a bank''s trading group and clients, said the people,
who declined to be identified because the hire hasn''t been
announced publicly. </p>
<p>Masucci will probably start in New York in August, the
people said. He reports to Tom Tormey, Jerry Keefe and Dennis
Lafferty, co-heads of the distressed investing group. </p>
<p>Renee Calabro, a Deutsche Bank spokeswoman, Michael
DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, and Masucci, all declined to
comment. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, has
recently made changes to its credit-sales and trading business,
including limiting private information such as corporate
financial projections that is available to employees in loan
sales and trading. </p>
<p>As part of the changes, earlier this year the bank named
Bryan Mix as global head of loan trading, and Jonathan Meltzer
and John Shaffer as co-heads of New York credit sales. </p>
<p>Mix previously ran the Asia credit business, Meltzer was
previously head of bank loan sales in New York and Shaffer was
head of high-yield and distressed distribution groups, also in
New York. </p>
<p>Leveraged loans, those rated below BBB- by Standard 
Poor''s and less than Baa3 at Moody''s Investors Service, are
usually private and investors in this debt can have access to
material non-public information that buyers of high-yield bonds
can''t. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Asset Managment''s Neil Gregson, manager of about $6.9 billion in natural-resource
assets, says mining companies should chase more takeovers as
rising costs force them to slow spending on expansions. </p>
<p>These companies that are curtailing capex should be, I''m
sure they are, more active in making opportunities of the low
valuations, London-based Gregson, who counts Xstrata Plc (XTA) and
Rio Tinto (RIO) Group among his top holdings, said in an interview in
London yesterday. We''d certainly support a lot more MA. </p>
<p>BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) and Rio Tinto, the first and third-
biggest mining companies by sales, said last month they''ll
ration spending because of escalating costs and waning global
economic growth. The Bloomberg World Mining Index (BWMING) has lost 18
percent this year. First Quantum Minerals Ltd. (FQM), African Minerals
Ltd. (AMI) and London Mining Plc are likely acquisition targets,
Jefferies Group Inc. said June 8. </p>
<p>It''s fairly obvious there''s lots of supply issues on
copper and that copper will be a very attractive place to be
probably for the next 10 years or more, said Gregson, a holder
of copper producers First Quantum and Freeport-McMoRan Copper 
Gold Inc. There is room for more on the iron-ore side maybe
with some of these West African companies. </p>
<p>African Minerals, which has a market value of 1.2 billion
pounds ($1.9 billion), and London Mining both produce the steel-
making raw material in Sierra Leone. It declined 1 percent to
355.5 pence at 11:30 a.m. in London. First Quantum, a producer
of copper in Africa, has dropped 13 percent this year, valuing
it at C$8.3 billion ($8.1 billion). It was unchanged in London
today. </p>
<h2>New Projects </h2>
<p>We''ve gone past the point where the capital expenditure
required to build new projects now far exceeds what you can go
out and buy, Gregson said, adding he sees more deals. That
is a trade-off where the companies should be much more active. </p>
<p>Mining companies globally have announced $95 billion of
deals in the year to date, up from $75 billion in the same
period of 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Glencore International Plc (GLEN) agreed an all-share takeover of
Xstrata in February that values the shares of the target it
doesn''t already own at about 19.8 billion pounds. </p>
<p>MA activity in the sector should accelerate in 2013 as
capex budgets begin to decline and after the Glencore Xstrata
merger closes, Jefferies analysts Christopher Lafemina and
Seth Rosenfeld said in a note. We expect shares of inexpensive
miners that have significant low-cost growth potential and
miners that are possible MA targets to outperform. </p>
<p>Companies like Glencore, this is the perfect environment
for them, Gregson said. They are buyers and sellers and I
presume that they are very much in the buying mode. </p>
<p>A drop of as much as 50 percent in mining company
valuations since last year, while capital spending costs gained
as much as 25 percent has shifted the balance in favor of
acquisitions and mergers, Liberum Capital Ltd. analysts said in
a note. Spending on new output will drop 19 percent to $103.8
billion next year, according to a Bank of America Corp. report. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon told Congress the bank let traders take
risks they didn''t understand while he didn''t answer key
questions about more than $2 billion in trading losses. </p>
<p>In testimony prepared for a hearing today, Dimon expressed
regret over losses in the bank''s chief investment office, saying
that its trading strategy was poorly conceived and vetted by
senior managers who were in transition and not paying
adequate attention. </p>
<p>This portfolio morphed into something that, rather than
protect the firm, created new and potentially larger risks,
Dimon said in the remarks ahead of his appearance today before
the Senate Banking Committee. We have let a lot of people
down, and we are sorry for it. </p>
<p>Dimon, 56, makes his first of two appearances on Capitol
Hill to face lawmakers probing how the largest and most
profitable U.S. bank, often praised for its fortress balance
sheet, could have taken such risks after coming through the 2008
financial crisis largely unscathed. His remarks left unanswered
what he knew when about the trading strategy and losses that
accelerated in March and April. </p>
<p>We all bought into the idea that Jamie was the best
manager in the world, said Paul Miller, a former examiner for
the Federal Reserve Board of Philadelphia and analyst at FBR
Capital Markets in Arlington, Virginia. For a guy who is known
for risk management, he certainly didn''t put in place a top-tier
risk management system or board. </p>
<h2>VaR Switch </h2>
<p>Dimon also didn''t address changes made earlier this year to
a company measurement known as value-at-risk, or VaR, that
underestimated the potential for losses. The switch -- and the
timing of the firm''s disclosures -- are the focus of an inquiry
by the Securities and Exchange Commission, agency chairman Mary Schapiro told the Senate panel on May 22. </p>
<p>Other government investigations of New York-based JPMorgan
include a study of internal oversight by the Federal Reserve, a
probe of the trades by the Comptroller of the Currency, and
additional inquiries by the Department of Justice and the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission. </p>
<p>Dimon said that the risk committee structures and processes
were not as robust in the CIO as they should have been. The
division''s London team built up a book of credit derivatives
that became so large by that employees couldn''t unwind it
without roiling markets or incurring large losses. </p>
<h2>Feels Terrible'' </h2>
<p>Dimon said he feels terrible that the firm will lose
shareholder money, yet defended the bank by saying lawmakers
needed to put the losses into perspective, noting that no
client, customer or taxpayer money was impacted. He said the
second quarter would be solidly profitable. </p>
<p>Dimon explained that the bank instructed the CIO in
December to reduce its risk-weighted assets to prepare for new
international capital rules. Instead, the office in mid-January
embarked on a complex strategy that entailed adding positions
that it believed would offset the existing ones, Dimon said.
The portfolio grew and the problem got worse. </p>
<p>[To read Dimon''s full testimony, click here.] </p>
<p>Shares of the bank have dropped 17 percent from May 10,
when Dimon disclosed the losses, through yesterday, lopping
about $26.5 billion from the firm''s market value. The furor cost
former Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew her job. </p>
<p>Senator Tim Johnson, the panel''s chairman, said in remarks
prepared for the hearing that he expected Dimon to answer how
the investment office, a unit designed to protect the company
from risk, could lose billions of dollars instead. </p>
<h2>Making Money </h2>
<p>How can a bank take on far too much risk'' if the point
of the trades was to reduce risk in the first place? the South
Dakota Democrat asked. Or was the goal really to make money?
Should any hedge result in billions of dollars of net gains or
losses, or should it be focused solely on reducing a bank''s
risks? </p>
<p>Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, the top Republican on
the panel, will focus on the specific nature of the bank''s
trades, according to Jonathan Graffeo, his spokesman. The
senator also intends to ask whether management ignored warning
signs inside the CIO and whether Dimon supports higher capital
standards, he said. </p>
<h2>Volcker Rule </h2>
<p>Dimon, who''s set to face the House Financial Services
Committee on June 19, will also find himself in the middle of a
renewed debate about whether regulators should tighten curbs on
trading by deposit-taking banks after mortgage bets pushed the
financial system to the brink of collapse four years ago. </p>
<p>Senator Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, has used the
trading losses as ammunition in his fight to tighten exemptions
in the so-called Volcker rule. Merkley, who co-wrote the
provision in the Dodd-Frank Act along with Senator Carl Levin of
Michigan, has said that the draft rule released by regulators in
2011 had loopholes that would allow banks to maintain much of
their proprietary trading operations. </p>
<p>Five U.S. agencies are working to complete the rule, which
is named for former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker and is intended to
reduce risky trading by banks with federally insured deposits
and access to the central bank''s discount window. </p>
<p>Investors and bankers, including Dimon, have speculated
that the loss may hurt their efforts to soften the Volcker rule
and other provisions of Dodd-Frank, which was passed to curb the
kinds of banking practices that contributed to the 2008
financial crisis. </p>
<h2>Hard Distinction </h2>
<p>The current draft of the Volcker rule permits banks to
continue trades for hedging but not for proprietary trading
designed to generate profits. Banks have said the distinction
can be hard to make. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s trading losses could lead to a more stringent
interpretation of the Volcker rule, Standard  Poor''s said in
a May 11 report. That, in turn, could affect JPM''s hedging
strategies going forward by disallowing certain tactics, adding
risk to JPM''s portfolio. </p>
<p>The bank''s pay policies might offer some insight to
lawmakers, said Simon Johnson, a former chief economist at the
International Monetary Fund. </p>
<p>What was the compensation arrangement for people in the
CIO, including traders and executives? asked Johnson, who now
teaches at Massachusetts Institute of Technology''s Sloan School
of Management. If they were paid based on firm-wide results,
they were hedging. If they were paid based on returns in CIO
itself, this is prop trading. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s biggest competitors, including Bank of America
Corp., Citigroup Inc. (C) and Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), have said their
corporate investment offices avoid the use of the kind of
derivatives that led to the trading losses and buy fewer bonds
exposed to credit risk. The rivals said their offices don''t
trade credit-default swaps on indexes linked to the health of
companies. </p>
<p>Dimon''s apology is a first step in the company''s plan to
assuage concerns of investors, said David Hendler, an analyst at
CreditSights Inc. in New York. </p>
<p>It''s not like you went through a stop sign and got a
slap-on-the-wrist ticket, Hendler said. It''ll have to be
every quarter for the next couple of years or so. That''s
basically job No. 1 for Jamie Dimon. </p>

<p>John Pleasants, co-president of Walt
Disney Co. (DIS)''s interactive unit, expressed concern after passing
the crocodile exhibit at the company''s Animal Kingdom theme park
in Orlando last year. </p>
<p>Disney was developing an iPhone application starring a
toothy reptile named Swampy, and the crocs at the park didn''t
strike him as very endearing. </p>
<p>Are you sure it''s going to be cuddly? Pleasants asked
his mobile-games chief, Bart Decrem, in a phone call. </p>
<p>Don''t worry about it, Decrem recalled answering, saying
he was confident the character would be accessible. </p>
<p>The Internet has been a jungle for entertainment companies
and Disney, the world''s largest, is no exception. The Burbank,
California-based firm has lost $1.39 billion in the past five
years in its interactive media group, which develops games and
website content. Its continuing commitment to the business was
evident at the video-game industry''s E3 trade show in Los
Angeles last week, with a booth as big as heavyweights
Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI) and Electronic Arts Inc. (EA)''s. </p>
<p>Disney Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger has
said the interactive unit will be profitable next year in part
because of a focus on games for social-networking sites such as
Facebook Inc. (FB)''s and for mobile devices. Both are capturing a
larger share of the $16.6 billion U.S. video-game market,
according to researcher NPD Group Inc. </p>
<p>We''re targeting 2013 as a year of profitability. It''s
about time, because we''ve invested a fair amount, Iger told
attendees at a conference sponsored by Sanford C. Bernstein 
Co. on May 30. It''s a space that we should be in because the
brands, we think, can perform well. </p>
<h2>Not There'' </h2>
<p>In the quarter ended March 31, the interactive unit lost
$70 million, smaller than the $115 million loss a year earlier. </p>
<p>The division may lose $160 million in fiscal 2012,
estimates Todd Juenger, an analyst with Bernstein in New York.
While it may turn profitable at one point next year, he
estimates a loss of $25 million for all of 2013. </p>
<p>They have been able to grow their revenues and shrink
their costs, Juenger said in a telephone interview. But
they''re still not there yet. </p>
<p>Disney''s Internet struggles began in the late 1990s, when
it acquired search engine Infoseek Corp. in transactions
totaling more than $1.5 billion. In 2001, the company recorded
$878 million in charges to close its Go.com web portal,
according to its annual report. </p>
<p>Outlays during the past five years include $350 million to
buy the children''s gaming site Club Penguin in 2007 and $563.2
million for social game-maker Playdom in 2010. Pleasants, who
ran Playdom, was named co-president of the interactive unit,
with former Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) executive James Pitaro. </p>
<h2>Media Follies </h2>
<p>Disney''s interactive experience mirrors that of media
industry rivals Viacom Inc. (VIA), which lost $316 million in 2010 on
Harmonix Music Systems, maker of the Rock Band video game,
and News Corp. (NWSA), which sold the social-networking site Myspace
last year for $545 million less than it paid. </p>
<p>We made some obvious mistakes on the gaming side,
initially with a focus on the console space, and clearly the
whole gaming area has changed radically, Iger told Bernstein
conference attendees. Our goal now and our strategy is to
diversify our gaming efforts. </p>
<p>Sales of mobile, social and other digital games represented
31 percent of the U.S. video game market last year, up from 20
percent in 2009, according to NPD. </p>
<p>Marvel: Avengers Alliance, a game the company launched
in March, has 9.3 million monthly users, placing it 16th among
Facebook games, according to Disney, which cited research from
AppData. </p>
<h2>Console Retreat </h2>
<p>The company will limit its investment in console games to
very Disney-branded, Marvel-branded titles, according to
Iger. This year, the interactive unit will release six
traditional video-game titles, down from 21 in 2009, according
to the company and VGChartz.com, a research site. </p>
<p>At E3, Disney announced a November release date for
Disney Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two, for Sony Corp. (6758),
Nintendo Co. and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) game platforms. </p>
<p>Two mobile titles titles also made their debuts at E3:
Temple Run: Brave, tied to this month''s Pixar film
Brave, and Where''s My Perry?, which features a character
from the Disney Channel cartoon Phineas and Ferb. </p>
<p>A mobile or a social game can be developed for $50,000 to
$5 million, according to Michael Pachter, a video game industry
analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. in Los Angeles. That compares
with $20 million for a multiple-console title, plus the added
cost of distributing discs. </p>
<h2>Design Costs </h2>
<p>Where''s My Water?, the Disney game featuring Swampy the
alligator, was designed in half a year by six developers for a
couple of hundred thousand dollars, Decrem said in a telephone
interview. A hit mobile game such as Rovio Entertainment''s
Angry Birds can generate $100 million in revenue, he said,
declining to release sales numbers for Where''s My Water? </p>
<p>You can bring a complete experience to market at a
fraction of the cost, Decrem said of mobile technology. It''s
real money and it''s doubling every year. </p>
<p>Where''s My Water? was introduced last September and is
Disney''s biggest mobile hit so far. The game is sixth on the
list of top-selling paid iPhone applications at Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s
iTunes store and No. 4 for iPads. Players pay 99 cents to
download the game and can purchase additional levels of play for
$1.99. </p>
<p>With Where''s My Water showing early success, Decrem
said he added more developers to the team, creating new chapters
and incentive for players to spend on the game. Disney also
threw resources behind the title, promoting it on the Disney
Channel cable network and on the Disney.com website. </p>
<p>Swampy now has a line of T-shirts and stuffed animals at
retailers such as Toys ''''R'''' Us Inc. (TOYS), and an animated Web 
series rolls out this year. </p>
<p>This is one of Disney''s strengths, Decrem said,
taking an alligator and making it adorable. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s chief
investment office engaged in trading strategies that set it
apart from other major U.S. banks, according to Thomas Curry,
head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. </p>
<p>OCC examiners probing JPMorgan''s $2 billion trading loss
have concluded that other big banks the agency regulates haven''t
followed similar practices with large, illiquid hedges, Curry
said in a letter to Senator Sherrod Brown dated June 12.
JPMorgan was more heavily involved in synthetic credit
derivatives than other banks, he said. </p>
<p>This event deserves our attention, not just because it is
an unexpectedly large loss, but because of the broader questions
it raises regarding risk management and reporting within the
bank, Curry said in the letter, responding to questions from
the Ohio Democrat. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said on May 10
his company suffered losses after making trades on credit
derivatives that Bloomberg News first reported April 5. Trades
involving the so-called IG9 index were involved, according to
the OCC. The loss has spurred lawmakers and regulators to
investigate trading behavior and regulatory interactions at the
largest U.S. bank. </p>
<p>In early April, the bank gave regulators information on the
positions that spurred meetings with bank management, Curry
said. The agency''s examiners told the bank to provide more
details on scope and risk, and they were evaluating the
positions and the bank''s strategy when the positions started a
steep decline, he said. </p>
<p>Dimon told senators at a hearing yesterday that the losses
came from a complex series of trades that wasn''t just one
single thing. He said that his company initially misinformed
regulators on specifics because its management misunderstood the
positions at the time. </p>
<p>The second we found out, the first people we got on the
phone with was our regulators to explain We have a problem, we
want to describe it to you'', Dimon said in testimony. And,
of course, they''ve been deeply engaged since then. </p>
<p>Eight OCC examiners at JPMorgan focused on capital markets
activities, according to the letter, with one specifically
watching the bank''s CIO. </p>
<p>The CIO activities were not historically considered to be
high-risk, Curry said, describing its $350 billion investment
portfolio as high credit quality. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said the
Bank of England is likely to ease policy again in response to
the mounting euro-area crisis, changing its previous forecast. </p>
<p>The probability of further easing in the U.K. has
increased markedly with the rapid escalation of the euro area
crisis, economist Kevin Daly in London said in a note today.
We expect the bank to supplement conventional'' QE with
specific actions to alleviate the funding conditions of U.K.
banks. The question of how much the bank eases by is
intrinsically linked to the question of how it eases. </p>
<p>On the timing of any move, Daly said there is a case for
waiting until the August Inflation Report, but we think a July
move is marginally more likely. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) was sued by a
Louisiana police pension fund for alleged securities fraud tied
to a trading loss of at least $2 billion. </p>
<p>The Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement System
claimed the biggest U.S. bank and top officials including Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon misled investors about its risk
management and financial condition from February 2010 to May
2012. </p>
<p>Defendants made false and misleading statements and
concealed material information relating to the company''s trading
practices, hedging of risk, risk management, and exposure to
risk of loss, according to the complaint filed today in U.S.
District Court in Manhattan. </p>
<p>The police pension plan is seeking class-action, or group,
status on behalf of all who bought JPMorgan Chase common stock
from February 2010 to May 2012, a number which may be in the
tens of thousands, according to the complaint. It is also
seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. </p>
<p>Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for the New York-based
bank, declined to comment on the allegations. </p>
<p>In May, Dimon announced the lender lost $2 billion as a
result of egregious mistakes by its Chief Investment Office.
Ina Drew, who led that office, retired after Dimon''s
announcement and was replaced by Matt James. </p>
<p>The case is Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement
System v. JPMorgan Chase  Co., 12-cv-4729, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>When Hal Dvorak, a Harvard scientist
whose ideas helped spur the advance of targeted cancer drugs,
sought a partner recently to help him develop new treatments, he
only had to walk two blocks to find one. </p>
<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), which is spending $100 million to open a
state-of-the-art laboratory in Boston, was there. For Dvorak,
teaming with Pfizer is an ideal arrangement, he said,
providing convenience and expertise bringing research into the
clinic. </p>
<p>Partnerships between industry and academia, of course,
aren''t new. Yet Pfizer, Sanofi, Merck  Co. (MRK) and other drug
companies are putting a new twist on the arrangement by stepping
up their level of collaboration with universities. In the case
of Pfizer, the world''s largest drug company is embedding
operations in Boston, San Francisco, New York and San Diego,
often in the very same buildings where famed academic
institutions have labs. </p>
<p>No matter how much money you have, nothing compares to
the innovation going on out in the world, said Jose Carlos Gutierrez-Ramos, the director of the Pfizer lab, in an
interview. We want to be here, integrated into this fabric. </p>
<p>The push represents Pfizer''s strategy for long-term drug
development at a time of uncertain prospects for new
blockbusters. Pfizer gained its two biggest sellers, the
cholesterol pill Lipitor and the painkiller Lyrica, in its $120
billion purchase of Warner-Lambert in 2000. As opportunities for
such mega-deals become more scarce in the pharmaceutical
industry, the need for long-range planning will become
increasingly important. </p>
<h2>Future Promise </h2>
<p>That''s why Pfizer sees embedding in academic labs so
crucial to its future. The ideas that show promise, we''ll buy
later, said Gutierrez-Ramos. </p>
<p>In two to three years, Pfizer plans to have 50 drug
development projects running in their centers around the
country, all of which have been opened since late 2010,
Gutierrez-Ramos said. </p>
<p>The initiative comes at a crucial point in the company''s
history. </p>
<p>Lipitor, once the world''s best-selling drug with more than
$12 billion a year in sales, stands to lose 80 percent of its
revenue as cheaper generic versions grab market share this year.
The company has also suffered a series of research failures
since 2006, when a drug designed to replace that revenue, the
good-cholesterol pill torcetrapib, was abandoned after being
linked to heart attacks. </p>
<h2>Read''s Strategy </h2>
<p>In response, Chief Executive Officer Ian Read has begun
cutting back the size of the company, selling one non-
pharmaceutical unit, planning to spin off another and trimming
expenses. He has said he wants to rebuild Pfizer into a smaller,
faster-moving company that focuses on development of new drugs. </p>
<p>It makes sense to outsource anything that someone else
can do better than you and that you don''t consider a core
competency or source of competitive advantage, Erik Gordon, a
professor of business at the University of Michigan in Ann
Arbor, said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>Pfizer gained less than 1 percent to $22.61 at the close in
New York. Since Dec. 3, 2010, the last trading day before Read
was named CEO, the stock has increased 35 percent. </p>
<h2>Strong Connections </h2>
<p>Pfizer is turning to executives like Gutierrez-Ramos, whose
job is to create strong connections within one of the world''s
most creative hotbeds for biotechnology innovation. </p>
<p>In Boston, the Pfizer lab is located in the same building
as offices of renowned research centers of Boston Children''s
Hospital and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, which would
make some potential partnerships just an elevator ride away. </p>
<p>The Boston lab has reviewed 400 partnership proposals in
the last year and is working on projects involving chronic
kidney disease, osteoporosis and cancer, Tony Coyle, chief
scientific officer for the Pfizer center, said in an interview. </p>
<p>Gutierrez-Ramos said he is trying to create an atmosphere
at the lab where outside researchers easily come and go, and
Pfizer''s scientists visit neighboring academicians on their
turf. </p>
<p>Pharmaceutical companies, which historically are highly
secretive about their work because of competition, need to be
willing to take more risks in the future, he said, creating
access to its inner sanctums to develop drugs earlier. </p>
<h2>Development Resources </h2>
<p>What Pfizer offers academic researchers are
extraordinary resources for drug development that nearby
university labs can''t match, said Harvard''s Dvorak. </p>
<p>Dvorak, in 1983, was one of the first scientists to
demonstrate that cancer cells secreted vascular endothelial
growth factor, or VEGF, the initial idea behind development of
drugs, such as Roche Holding AG (ROG)''s Avastin, that cut off the
blood supply to tumors to stop their spread. </p>
<p>An academic lab can only go so far, Dvorak said in a
telephone interview from Boston. We''re good at identifying
targets, but if you want to make monoclonal antibodies or take
this to the clinic, we have no experience in that. That''s not
our bag. </p>
<p>Coyle, of Pfizer''s center, agrees. We''ve cured diabetes
in mice so many times in the laboratory, Coyle said. But
there''s been a very poor appreciation from the academic
community about how to develop drugs for use in the clinic. </p>
<h2>18th Floor </h2>
<p>An example of the advantages for academics can be seen in a
single machine located on the lab''s 18th floor. </p>
<p>Separated by a wall of glass from an open-plan suite for
the group''s top managers, the machine has the ability to rapidly
test thousands of compounds against Pfizer''s own chemical
library to see if they match with known disease pathways or
proteins that have been identified as possible targets. Past
rows of lab benches, two rooms full of complex imaging equipment
are used to identify how proteins interact. </p>
<p>Universities and research institutes need all the help they
can get, according to a report by the Tufts Center for the Study
of Drug Development released in April. Funding from the U.S.
National Institutes of Health has been unchanged for a decade,
at about $31 billion for 2013. </p>
<p>At the same time, pharmaceutical companies have cut their
early-stage research budgets in a tough economy to focus on
late-stage clinical development and marketing, the report said. </p>
<h2>Significant Change </h2>
<p>The partnership model now being pursued by Pfizer and a few
other large drugmakers, represents the most significant change
in the innovative landscape we''ve seen in three decades, said
Ken Kaitin, director of the Tufts center. </p>
<p>Sanofi (SAN), based in Paris, has its own collaboration program,
with Harvard, the University of California, San Francisco, and
several others, the company said. </p>
<p>In March, Merck, the second-biggest U.S. drugmaker,
announced it was joining the party. The Whitehouse Station, New
Jersey-based company said it will spend as much as $90 million
over seven years to help fund a new California Institute for
Biomedical Research it will run in San Diego. </p>
<p>With academic centers, with the reduction in NIH support,
there''s almost a desperation that they must, must find new
revenue streams, Kaitin said in an interview in Boston.
That, in most cases, means working with industry. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will announce plans
to sell a tablet running the next version of the Windows
operating system under its own brand, a major departure from its
strategy of partnering with computer makers, according to a
person familiar with the plans. </p>
<p>The Redmond, Washington-based company may demonstrate the
device at an event in Los Angeles on June 18, said the person,
who asked not to be identified because the plans haven''t been
made public. The company has said it aims to release the new
Windows 8 operating system in time for the holiday season. </p>
<p>Microsoft has been working with personal-computer makers to
produce Windows 8 tablets, designed to win back consumers who
have shunned Windows machines in favor of Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s iPad. The
world''s largest software maker may be taking steps to exert more
control over the hardware that runs its programs -- as Apple
does -- in order to mount a more successful challenge. </p>
<p>If Microsoft wants to control the entire user experience
and the entire quality of their products, they have to build
their own hardware, said Michael Cherry, an analyst at
Directions on Microsoft, a Kirkland, Washington-based market-
research firm. </p>
<p>Frank Shaw, a spokesman for Microsoft, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Yesterday, the company invited press via e-mail to an event
in Los Angeles on June 18 at 3:30 p.m., at a location to be
disclosed later. </p>
<p>This will be a major Microsoft announcement -- you will
not want to miss it, the invitation said. </p>
<h2>Software Focus </h2>
<p>Microsoft shares rose 2.3 percent to $30.02 at the close in
New York. The stock has gained 16 percent this year. </p>
<p>Since the release of International Business Machines
Corp.''s first PC in 1981, Microsoft has focused on software for
the machines and left design and branding to hardware makers.
While the company has in the past decade played a larger role in
working with some PC makers on design, it has shied away from
developing the machines and selling them under the Microsoft
brand. </p>
<p>The shift in strategy has the potential to sour Microsoft''s
relationship with some PC partners, many of which have been
investing to develop Windows 8 tablets themselves and may not
want to compete directly with Microsoft. </p>
<p>Still, PC makers may have limited recourse, said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners LP in New York. Apple doesn''t
license its software to computer makers, and Google Inc. (GOOG), which
makes the Android operating system, will probably make its own
tablets through its recent acquisition of Motorola Mobility. </p>
<h2>Tablet Options </h2>
<p>If you''re a computer maker, you don''t love it, Gillis
said. But what are you going to do? Build an Android tablet?
Google is going to build its own tablet, too. Everyone is making
their own hardware now. It''s like having a poodle in your purse.
All the cool kids are doing it. </p>
<p>The addition of a tablet would radically alter
profitability in the Windows business, which now sells just
software with operating margins of more than 60 percent. By
comparison, computer maker Dell Inc. (DELL)''s operating margin for the
most recent fiscal year was about 7 percent. </p>
<p>A move into tablets would be a similar strategy to the one
Microsoft employed with its Zune music and video player.
Microsoft initially provided software to partners, who failed to
gain share against Apple''s iPod, forcing Microsoft to produce
its own hardware. The Zune failed to dent Apple''s dominant
market share, and Microsoft canceled the product last year. </p>
<h2>Controlled Experience </h2>
<p>For Microsoft, sticking with devices from its PC partners
only may be equally risky. Sales in the Windows group have
missed analysts'' estimates in four of the six most recent
quarters as consumers shifted to purchasing tablets rather than
lower-cost laptop PCs running Windows. Microsoft, which
initially released a version of Windows for tablet machines in
2002 before scaling back, has zero share of the market now,
according to researcher Gartner Inc. </p>
<p>Selling a branded tablet would help the company make sure
the new Windows dovetails exactly with the hardware, avoiding
issues that have cropped up when computer makers have added
their own software that has degraded or limited the performance
or design of Windows. </p>
<p>The idea would be to make sure Microsoft''s vision for
such a device is translated exactly into the consumer experience
without a third-party interpretation, said Michael Gartenberg,
an analyst at Gartner. </p>
<h2>Apple''s Dominance </h2>
<p>Apple has expanded its grip on the tablet market even as
companies such as Amazon.com Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co.
release new tablets running Google''s Android software and PC
makers work to prepare their Windows 8 tablets. Researcher IDC
yesterday boosted its forecast for the tablet market on strong
demand for the iPad. </p>
<p>Worldwide shipments of tablets this year will be 107.4
million units, up from an earlier projection of 106.1 million,
Framingham, Massachusetts-based IDC said in a statement. Unit
sales may reach 142.8 million next year and 222.1 million by
2016, the researcher said. </p>
<p>IDC predicts the iPad will account for 62.5 percent of
global shipments this year, up from 58.2 percent last year.
Apple''s share could rise even further if it introduces a smaller,
less expensive tablet, IDC said. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s tablet plans were previously reported by
entertainment website The Wrap and the All Things D blog. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s merchant
bank, which has raised about $120 billion in funds ranging from
private equity and debt to infrastructure, said today that three
of its most senior employees are leaving. </p>
<p>Muneer Satter, who built the world''s largest family of
mezzanine funds; Hughes Lepic, who ran the merchant-banking
division in Europe; and Gerald J. Cardinale, co-head of Americas
private-equity funds, have decided to retire, according to three
separate memos from Richard A. Friedman, who leads the merchant-
banking division. They have worked at New York-based Goldman
Sachs for 24, 22 and 20 years, respectively, the memos show. </p>
<p>The loss of the three partners -- the highest rank of
employee at Goldman Sachs -- comes as the fifth-biggest U.S.
bank by assets prepares for new regulations that will cap banks''
investments in such funds to 3 percent. Goldman Sachs had stakes
worth $8.83 billion in private-equity funds, $3.74 billion in
private-debt funds and $1.54 billion in real estate funds at the
end of March, according to a quarterly filing. </p>
<p>I would stay at Goldman Sachs forever if I could,
Satter, 50, said in a press release today about his decision to
leave after 12 years of commuting to New York from his home in
Chicago. Starting in July, I look forward to spending each day
and evening with my wife and five children. </p>
<h2>Private Equity </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs lost about 50 partners last year as the
company cut pay awards in its worst year for profit since 2008.
The company, which was a partnership before going public in
1999, continues to reward a select group of employees with the
title of partner and a special pool of compensation. New
partners are appointed every even-numbered year. </p>
<p>Lepic, 47, who is retiring at the end of August, joined
Goldman Sachs in 1990 to work in mergers and acquisitions in New
York and moved to London in 1991. He has worked in the Principal
Investment Area, which manages the bank''s own investments and is
known as PIA, since 1996 and has held his current role since
2009. </p>
<p>Lepic, a French citizen, helped establish Goldman Sachs
as one of the leading principal investors in Europe in private
equity, credit and infrastructure, according to the memo.
During his tenure PIA invested over $7 billion in private-
equity transactions in Europe. </p>
<h2>YES Network </h2>
<p>Cardinale, 45, who is staying until the end of the year,
joined the firm''s corporate finance division in New York in 1992
before working in investment banking in Hong Kong and PIA in
Singapore. In 1997 he returned to New York to work as an
investment banker to telecommunications, media and technology
companies before returning to PIA in 1999. He has been a partner
since 2004. </p>
<p>Cardinale, known as Gerry, was responsible for more than $6
billion in investments, including the firm''s holding in Yankees
Entertainments  Sports Network, which was founded in 2001 to
broadcast the games of the New York Yankees baseball team and
the New Jersey Nets basketball team. Yankees third-baseman Alex Rodriguez worked with Cardinale and John Mallory in 2007 to help
him negotiate a new contract, people familiar with the matter
said at the time. </p>
<p>While Goldman Sachs doesn''t break out the merchant bank''s
revenue or profit, gains on its holdings are included in a
segment called Investing  Lending in the company''s
quarterly reports. That business generated about 7 percent of
Goldman Sachs''s net revenue in 2011, 19 percent in 2010 and 6
percent in 2009, according to company reports. </p>
<h2>Fed Meeting </h2>
<p>Over the period from 1999 through the first quarter of
2012, the firm''s aggregate net revenues from its investments in
hedge funds and private-equity funds were not material to the
firm''s aggregate total net revenues over the same period,
according to a Goldman Sachs''s regulatory filing for the quarter
ended in March. </p>
<p>At a meeting with Federal Reserve Board staff in February,
Goldman Sachs executives argued that credit funds should be
exempted from the 3 percent investment cap, according to a
meeting summary published in February. </p>
<p>Henry Cornell, 56, who has worked in the merchant-banking
division since 1992 and became a partner in 1994, was named vice
chairman of the division, according to a separate memo. Tom Connolly, who has served with Satter as co-head of the
corporate-credit business that oversees loan and mezzanine
funds, will become sole head of that unit. Andrew Wolff will
move to London from Hong Kong to lead the division in Europe,
while remaining co-head of the business in Asia with Ankur Sahu. </p>
<h2>Deep Bench </h2>
<p>We are confident that these changes position us strongly
for future success, Friedman wrote in the memo. They also
demonstrate our deep leadership bench as we elevate a new set of
leaders and create opportunities for other MBD professionals. </p>
<p>Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman for the bank, confirmed the
memos'' contents. </p>
<p>Stephanie Hui, who has worked in the merchant-banking
division for more than 12 years, will run the Asia business
excluding Japan from Hong Kong and will report to Wolff,
according to the memo. Hui was promoted to partner in 2010. </p>
<p>Adrian M. Jones, a partner since 2004, and Sanjeev Mehra, a
partner since 1998, will run the private-equity business in the
Americas, while San Francisco-based Joseph P. DiSabato, who has
been a partner since 2004, will remain head of GS Growth,
according to the memo. Sumit Rajpal, a partner since 2010, will
lead the global financial institutions business and Kenneth A. Pontarelli, a partner since 2006, will continue to oversee the

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) agreed to start
drilling tight oil prospects in Siberia in 2013 with state-run
OAO Rosneft as Russia looks to tap the technology that reversed
slumping U.S. output. </p>
<p>Exxon will finance geological studies and drilling at the
Bazhenov and Achimov shale formations, the companies said today
in a statement. After the exploration stage, the Irving, Texas-
based producer will get a 33.3 percent stake in any development,
they said. </p>
<p>President Vladimir Putin, who oversaw today''s agreement and
an earlier accord in April, is inviting foreign producers to
help reverse declines in the mature West Siberia oil province
and keep output at a post-Soviet high of more than 10 million
barrels a day. Crude and gas provided half of the government''s
budget revenue last year. </p>
<p>We didn''t choose this partner by chance, Rosneft Chief
Executive Officer Igor Sechin said today, highlighting the U.S.
unconventional oil and shale gas boom. He spoke at a signing
ceremony attended by Putin and his Exxon counterpart Rex
Tillerson in Tuapse on Russia''s Black Sea coast. </p>
<p>The companies will seek to pump a mixture of chemicals and
sand into horizontal wells to smash the low permeability rock
that characterizes the Bazhenov geology and thus increase the
amount of oil flowing up wells. Such output from the Bakken
shale in North Dakota has pushed an U.S. oil boom that since
2009 has begun to reverse almost two decades of decline,
according to BP Plc (BP/) data. </p>
<h2>International Partnership </h2>
<p>Today''s tight oil agreement firms up part of the wide-
ranging partnership signed in April in which Exxon has pledged
to spend $3.2 billion to study and drill for some of the world''s
largest resources in difficult, unexplored provinces in Russia''s
deepwater Black Sea and the Arctic Kara Sea. Rosneft, meanwhile,
has signed agreements to gain stakes in Exxon projects in Texas,
Canada and the Gulf of Mexico. </p>
<p>Russia is developing tax incentives by October to encourage
development of unconventional oil deposits. </p>
<p>The pilot wells will seek to locate deposits that Rosneft
has said may hold 13.2 billion barrels of oil, a prospect needed
for Russia to keep supplying 16 percent of global exports
another decade. </p>
<p>We are not only looking at new geographical regions of
operation, but are also studying the potential of difficult to
produce reserves in traditional oil producing regions, Sechin
said. </p>

<p>The U.S. Federal Communications
Commission plans to ask whether its standards protect people
from mobile-phone radiation, a question it hasn''t posed in 15
years, as people use smartphones for longer, more frequent
calls. </p>
<p>Julius Genachowski, the agency''s chairman, is asking fellow
commissioners to approve a notice commencing a formal inquiry,
Tammy Sun, a spokeswoman for the agency, said in an e-mailed
statement. The notice won''t propose rules, Sun said. </p>
<p>Our action today is a routine review of our standards,
Sun said. We are confident that, as set, the emissions
guidelines for devices pose no risks to consumers. </p>
<p>The FCC last updated its guidelines setting maximum
radiation-exposure levels, which are based on the amount of heat
emitted by mobile phones, in 1996. </p>
<p>Any changes in the rules will have an impact on handset
vendors, said CW Cheung, the Asia-Pacific head of consulting
for telecoms at Ovum, which advises companies in the
telecommunications industry. As most vendors are based outside
the U.S., it could also become a trade issue. </p>
<p>Samsung Electronics Co. (005930), based in Suwon, South Korea, was
the world''s biggest vendor of mobile handsets in the first-
quarter, according to research company Strategy Analytics.
Finland''s Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) ranked second, while Cupertino, California-
based Apple Inc. (AAPL) was third, according to the researcher. </p>

<p>Muneer Satter, who built the world''s
largest family of mezzanine funds at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS),
is leaving the bank after 24 years, according to two people
familiar with his plans. </p>
<p>Satter, 50, is departing to spend more time with his family
after commuting for the past 12 years from his home in Chicago
to Goldman Sachs''s headquarters in New York, the people said,
asking not to be named because his move hasn''t been announced
publicly. </p>
<p>Satter, who serves as one of the co-chairs for U.S.
presidential candidate Mitt Romney''s national finance committee,
became a partner at Goldman Sachs in 1996 and oversees a team of
about 20 people who work in the firm''s merchant bank. The
business has raised more than $28 billion since its inception 16
years ago and is the biggest in the world, according to the
company''s website. </p>
<p>I''m surprised he lasted as many years as he did commuting
from Chicago, said Gordon Crawford, the fund manager at
Capital Group Cos. in Los Angeles whose views help shape media
industry deals. He''s been offered other gigs in New York but
that''s not going to happen. </p>
<p>Satter didn''t return a call seeking comment about his
departure. </p>
<p>Mezzanine funds make loans to companies at higher rates
than banks and buy their preferred stock. They profit from
interest payments and the eventual sale of the equity interest.
The financing technique is often used in takeovers, and can take
the place of high-yield, high-risk debt. </p>
<h2>Merchant Bank </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s merchant bank, which has raised about $120
billion in funds ranging from private equity and debt to
infrastructure, named Satter as both chairman of its risk
committee and a member of the investment committee. Satter''s
group started with $1.2 billion and created its largest fund, of
$13 billion, in 2007. </p>
<p>While Goldman Sachs doesn''t break out the merchant bank''s
revenue or profit, gains on its holdings are included in a
segment called Investing  Lending in the company''s
quarterly reports. That business generated about 7 percent of
Goldman Sachs''s net revenue in 2011, 19 percent in 2010 and 6
percent in 2009, according to company reports. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s mezzanine funds could become subject to the
Volcker rule, which limits depository institutions from
supplying more than 3 percent of the capital in a hedge fund,
private-equity fund or other covered fund. Goldman Sachs has
been asking regulators to loosen the proposed limits on bank
investments in such pools. </p>
<h2>Alliance Boots </h2>
<p>Satter''s deals include helping to finance the 11.1 billion-
pound ($17.2 billion) leveraged buyout of Alliance Boots Plc,
the largest U.K. drugstore chain, and Blackstone Group LP''s
takeover of Anheuser-Busch InBev NV''s amusement-park business
for $2.3 billion. </p>
<p>Muneer got to the point pretty quickly and, as a client,
you didn''t try bullying terms out of him, Christopher Stadler,
managing partner at CVC Capital Partners Ltd., said in an
interview. He responded to the strength of the relationship. </p>
<p>As a result of helping to finance LBOs, Satter''s unit
worked closely with the investment bank''s financial-sponsors
group, which was previously co-led globally by Milton Berlinski.
Berlinski left the bank after 25 years in December. </p>
<p>Satter contributed $95,000 to the super-PAC backing Romney,
Open Secrets data show. </p>
<p>He has been a leader and adviser to me and my campaign,
for which I''m grateful, Romney said through a spokesman.
Even more importantly, I consider him a dear friend. </p>
<h2>Rahm Emanuel </h2>
<p>At the local level, he has contributed to Chicago mayor
Rahm Emanuel, Open Secrets data show. He sits on the board of
World Business Chicago, the city''s not-for-profit economic-
development corporation whose chairman is Emanuel. </p>
<p>He is also chairman of the finance committee at the Nature
Conservancy, a nonprofit that promotes diversity among the
world''s plant and animal species, according to the
organization''s website. </p>
<p>I have followed his career and his success is no
surprise, said Sam Zell, chairman of Equity Group Investments
LLC. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Co. (KO) plans to return to
Myanmar for the first time in more than 60 years, leaving Cuba
and North Korea as the only nations where the maker of the
world''s most popular soft drink doesn''t do business. </p>
<p>The company will start operating in Myanmar as soon as the
U.S. government issues a license allowing investments in the
Southeast Asian country, a move that may be imminent, the
Atlanta-based company said in a statement distributed by
Businesswire yesterday. </p>
<p>Myanmar is enhancing economic, military and political ties
with Western nations after years of isolation that left its 64
million people among Asia''s poorest. The country''s transition to
democracy in recent months after about five decades of military
rule prompted the U.S. to ease sanctions in May. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola''s planned entry into Myanmar, following the
suspension of sanctions, will be governed by its well-
established global standards for corporate ethics including
strict adherence to its global human and workplace rights
policy, supplier guiding principles, code of business conduct,
and anti-bribery policies, the company said in the statement. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola will initially import some products from
neighboring countries before making significant investments in
Myanmar over the next three-five years, the company said,
adding it will work with local partners to support the country''s
long-term economic development. </p>
<h2>Cuba, North Korea </h2>
<p>Coca-Cola has grown from selling nine drinks a day in a
single country in 1886 to distributing 1.8 billion beverages in
more than 200 nations, according to data posted on its website.
Myanmar, Cuba and North Korea are the only countries where Coca-
Cola doesn''t operate, the company said yesterday. Coca-Cola says
the 1971-vintage advertisement entitled I''d Like to Buy the
World a Coke remains one of its most popular. </p>
<p>PepsiCo Inc. (PEP), the world''s second-largest soft-drink maker,
pulled out of Myanmar in 1997 after shareholder groups and
activists urged the company to sever ties with the military
dictatorship because of human-rights violations. Heineken NV,
the world''s third-biggest brewer, withdrew in 1996. </p>
<p>Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi earlier this
month warned investors against reckless optimism in the
country''s move toward democracy. In a speech in Bangkok, her
first outside Myanmar in 24 years, Suu Kyi called job creation
her top priority and called for healthy skepticism of
Myanmar''s reform process. </p>
<p>London-based WPP Plc (WPP), the world''s biggest advertising
company, and Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT), India''s biggest automaker, have
announced moves to expand in Myanmar in recent months, while
General Electric Co. and Honda Motor Co. (7267) are among other
companies considering investing in the nation. Myanmar is set
for economic takeoff if it implements the right policies, the
International Monetary Fund said last month. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) opens the Cars Land
attraction in Anaheim, California, to the public today, part of
its largest investment ever in the theme-park unit. The
implications are broad for both earnings and succession at the
world''s largest entertainment company. </p>
<p>The 12-acre addition at California Adventure, next-door to
Disneyland, takes guests through the fictional town of Radiator
Springs from the two Cars movies. More than 4,000 tons of
steel and 280,000 feet (85 kilometers) of rock work were
installed, including mountains shaped like vintage Cadillac tail
fins. </p>
<p>The $1.1 billion remodeling of California Adventure,
including Cars Land, is part of a multiyear expansion of the
parks and resorts division that adds two more cruise ships,
attractions in Orlando and Hong Kong and a $4.4 billion Shanghai
park scheduled for 2015. Disney has raised prices in Anaheim in
a bet the new rides will draw consumers even as the economic
recovery remains tentative. </p>
<p>It''s a crucial test, too, for Thomas Staggs, who moved over
to lead the parks unit in 2010 after 12 years as Disney''s chief
financial officer. He is seen by investors, along with Chief
Financial Officer Jay Rasulo, as a contender to be named chief
executive of Burbank, California-based Disney when Robert Iger
relinquishes the title in March 2015. </p>
<p>Bob had to take Tom out of his comfort zone to give him
operational experience at what is the soul of the company, the
parks, said David Miller, an analyst who follows Disney for
Caris  Co. in Los Angeles. If you took a poll of 100
portfolio managers, 55 percent would say Staggs gets the job, 45
percent Rasulo. Mr. Staggs has the leg up. </p>
<h2>Profit Margin </h2>
<p>Staggs said he is content where he is. </p>
<p>You get to open a park like this, makes me feel like I''ve
got one of best jobs in the world, Staggs said at a June 13
event at Cars Land. I''m not anxious about going anywhere
anytime soon, so as long as I can keep doing this I''m happy. </p>
<p>Parks and resorts is Disney''s second-largest unit, after
its television networks, accounting for 29 percent of sales and
18 percent of profit in fiscal 2011. The networks, led by ESPN
and Disney Channel, generated almost four times the parks unit''s
$1.55 billion in profit, on about 1 1/2 times its $11.8 billion
in revenue. </p>
<p>The choices to fix California Adventure and invest in other
leisure businesses were made over the past five years, even as
the company was offering discounts to entice recession-conscious
travelers to its parks, Iger said in an interview. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s largest
drugmaker, failed to win U.S. regulators'' approval of its drug
to treat TTR-FAP, a rare and deadly genetic disorder affecting
8,000 people worldwide. </p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration asked for a second
clinical trial showing the effectiveness of tafamidis meglumine,
New York-based Pfizer said today in a statement. The pill would
be the first approved treatment in the U.S. for TTR-FAP, or
Transthyretin Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy. </p>
<p>TTR-FAP robs patients of the use of their limbs from the
feet upwards, and as their digestive system turns against them,
they waste away and die in about a decade. In Europe, the drug
was approved in November for sale under the name Vyndaqel.
Pfizer estimates there are 3,000 U.S. patients. </p>
<p>TTR-FAP is a relentless and debilitating disease. We
understand the urgent need within the patient community and
stand firmly behind this innovative medicine, Yvonne Greenstreet, senior vice president and head of medicines
development group for Pfizer''s Specialty Care Business Unit,
said in the company''s statement. It is our intention to
request a meeting as soon as possible with the agency in order
to discuss a potential path forward. </p>
<p>Tafamidis works by locking down transthyretin, a protein
made by the liver. In healthy people, the protein holds
together. In those with TTR-FAP, it breaks apart, forming toxic
plaques that attack the body''s longest nerves, paralyzing limbs
and ruining the digestive system. </p>
<h2>Liver Transplant </h2>
<p>The current treatment is a liver transplant -- the organ
produces the problematic protein and a new one can extend
patients'' lives. </p>
<p>Analysts haven''t estimated a market for the medicines.
Pfizer declined to comment on its European or potential U.S.
sales. </p>
<p>Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ALNY), based in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, also has a drug in early trials to treat TTR-FAP.
Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ISIS), based in Carlsbad, California, and
London-based GlaxoSmithKline Plc have teamed to develop a
treatment. </p>
<p>The Alnylam and Isis drugs stop production of the
transthyretin protein, said Rodney Falk, director of Boston-
based Brigham and Women''s Hospital''s program for cardiac
amyloidosis, a related disease where patients'' heart muscles are
damaged. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s credit-
derivatives trades that lost the biggest U.S. bank more than $2
billion were thwarted by market illiquidity, saidDavid Kelly,
director of financial engineering at Calypso Technology Inc. </p>
<p>Credit derivatives traders value the contracts with an
assumption that if pricing relationships break down, the market
is active and deep enough that hedge funds and others that seek
to profit from such dislocations will drive the prices together,
Kelly said. Instead, by using indexes less active than benchmark
contracts and so-called tranches of the indexes that are more
difficult to trade, correlation with the rest of the market
deteriorated, he said. </p>
<p>Lack of liquidity wasn''t fully appreciated or fully
considered, Kelly, who previously helped manage counterparty
risk at JPMorgan and Citigroup Inc., said in a telephone
interview. This thing should have been making money, but the
illiquidity and therefore the pricing distorted the normal
behavior. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon disclosed the
loss in its chief investment office on a May 10 conference call,
saying it stemmed from trades that had been designed to hedge
the bank''s credit risk. A shift in strategy that was supposed to
reduce the hedge instead turned out to be flawed, complex,
poorly reviewed, poorly executive and poorly monitored, Dimon
said on the call. </p>
<h2>London Whale </h2>
<p>Bloomberg News first reported April 5 that Bruno Iksil, a
trader for the chief investment office in London, had taken on
positions that were so large he was driving price moves in the
$10 trillion market for credit-default swaps indexes. </p>
<p>By amassing positions of as much as $100 billion in a
corporate credit-default swaps index created in 2007, Iksil
earned the nickname London Whale among some counterparties,
according to market participants who asked not to be identified
because they weren''t authorized to discuss the trades. </p>
<p>The benchmark, known as Series 9 of the Markit CDX North
America Investment Grade Index, or IG9, had grown less active as
new versions were created every six months. Iksil also used so-
called tranches that take more concentrated risks on the
companies in the index. </p>
<p>The loss underscores the difficulty banks face in hedging
their risks and the ambiguity between those efforts and the kind
of proprietary risks that Congress is seeking to limit for
federally subsidized lenders, said Kelly, who joined Calypso in
March. </p>
<h2>Volcker Rule </h2>
<p>San Francisco-based Calypso, founded in 1997, sells
software to banks and investment firms for managing trade
processing and risk in derivatives markets, according to the
company''s website. </p>
<p>As part of an overhaul of financial regulations passed in
2010, Congress approved the so-called Volcker rule, named after
former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, to limit banks''
wagers on markets with their own capital. </p>
<p>When he helped manage counterparty risk at JPMorgan and
Citigroup, Kelly said the desk would sometimes be given a
position to hedge that couldn''t be matched perfectly. The big
basket of loans on JPMorgan''s book would be impossible to
hedge symmetrically, he said. </p>
<p>You can''t possibly hedge it so you''re left with a
position, Kelly said. You have no choice but to take some
risk. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) needs to shed its
image as the world''s biggest purveyor of workplace software and
draw on its success selling the Xbox gaming console if it wants
a shot at introducing a tablet to challenge Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s iPad. </p>
<p>Microsoft is expected to preview a company-branded tablet
at an event in Los Angeles today, according to people familiar
with the matter who asked not to be named because the plans
aren''t public. The devices may run Microsoft''s latest operating
system, Windows 8, and different versions may be powered by
either processors based on designs from ARM Holdings Plc or x86
chips from Intel Corp., the people said. </p>
<p>As the primary pitchman for its own tablets, Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft needs to assemble a compelling lineup
of applications at an attractive price, which may be tough given
the least expensive current iPad sells for $499. That''s been
impossible for challengers such as Hewlett-Packard Co. and
Research In Motion Ltd. that have tried to compete with Apple in
the tablet market, estimated to reach $78.7 billion this year. </p>
<p>Telling compelling marketing stories to consumers for the
most part is not something Microsoft has demonstrated an ability
to do, said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at market
researcher Gartner Inc., in an interview. </p>
<p>Xbox is the exception, he said. Microsoft has sold 67
million Xbox 360s in seven years on the market, making it the
most popular game platform, even appearing in rocker Liz Phair''s
song lyrics. </p>
<h2>Xbox Entertainment </h2>
<p>Sales surged as Microsoft transformed Xbox from a video-
game player into a full-fledged entertainment center, starting
in 2008 with the addition of Netflix Inc.''s video streaming and
the music service Last.fm. Earlier this month, Microsoft
unveiled Xbox SmartGlass, an app that will work on Windows 8 to
let smartphones, tablets and computers stream media to a screen
controlled by the console. </p>
<p>Obviously, Microsoft is hoping this will be another
Xbox, Gartenberg said. </p>
<p>Microsoft might have a shot at competing with Apple if its
tablet includes the content and functionality of Xbox,
particularly if the device had a controller letting it work as a
gaming platform, said Ed Maguire, an analyst at Credit Agricole
Securities USA. </p>
<p>When you add up all of the relationships Microsoft has
through the Xbox, Microsoft has all of the content relationships
to compete with Apple, Maguire said in an interview. </p>
<p>Worldwide shipments of tablets this year will be 107.4
million units, Framingham, Massachusetts-based researcher IDC
said in a June 14 report. Worldwide shipments should reach 142.8
million next year and 222.1 million by 2016, the group said. </p>
<h2>Apple''s Grip'' </h2>
<p>Even as companies including Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Samsung
Electronics Co. (005930) release new tablets running Google Inc. (GOOG)''s
Android operating system, Apple''s iPad continues to dominate the
market. IDC predicts the iPad will account for 62.5 percent of
global shipments this year, up from 58.2 percent last year.
Apple''s share could rise even further if it introduces a
smaller, less expensive tablet. </p>
<p>Apple''s iPad shows few signs of slowing down, Tom Mainelli, IDC''s research director of mobile connected devices,
said in the report. If Apple launches a sub-$300, 7-inch
product into the market later this year as rumored, we expect
the company''s grip on this market to become even stronger. </p>
<p>DisplaySearch, another research firm, said revenue from
tablets reached $44.9 billion worldwide in 2011 and will rise to
$78.7 billion this year. </p>
<h2>Pricing Challenge </h2>
<p>Microsoft may not be able to sell tablets running Windows
RT, the version of Windows 8 for machines with power-sipping ARM
chips, for less than $599, said Bob O''Donnell, an analyst at
IDC, in an interview. </p>
<p>When you look at that pricing compared to Apple, it''s a
non-starter, said O''Donnell, whose price estimate is based on
his checks with component suppliers in Taiwan. It appears
pricing is going to be a lot higher than people thought. From a
tablet perspective, that''s going to be a challenge. </p>
<p>Amazon.com had to make several tradeoffs to get its Kindle
Fire tablet to $199, such as sporting a smaller screen size,
forgoing Bluetooth wireless connectivity and reducing on-board
memory. Sales of Amazon''s electronic books, movies and music on
the device may help make up for the narrower profit margins that
will probably result from the low price, according to Brian Blair, an analyst at Wedge Partners Corp. in New York. </p>
<p>There''s not a whole lot of room to move on price in these
devices, Gartenberg said. </p>
<h2>Apps Disadvantage </h2>
<p>Then there''s the apps issue. Tablets running Windows RT,
the machines that are most comparable to the iPad, may have
fewer apps than users are accustomed to because older software
won''t work on the devices. There are more than 200,000 apps made
specifically for the iPad. </p>
<p>Microsoft will make four programs in its Office suite --
Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote -- available on its tablet-
optimized operating system. That may not sway consumers who have
gladly snapped up iPads without the availability of Office, said
Michael Cherry, an analyst at Directions on Microsoft, a
Kirkland, Washington-based market-research firm. </p>
<p>I don''t believe consumers are going to pay a premium on a
tablet to get those Office applications, he said. Windows RT
tablets may not have one feature people do use -- Outlook e-mail
-- which could curb demand from corporate information technology
departments, Cherry said. </p>
<p>Through a joint venture with Barnes  Noble Inc. (BKS) announced
in April, Microsoft is developing a digital reading app for
Windows 8 that will offer a catalog of e-books, magazines and
newspapers. Barnes  Noble isn''t involved in the Microsoft
announcement today, according to a person familiar with the
matter who asked not to be named because the plans are private. </p>
<h2>Building Apps </h2>
<p>The company is also pulling out the stops to debut Windows
8 apps, lining up design firms, recruiting interns and sending
engineers on an around-the-world road show to help developers
get them built. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s last bid to challenge Apple by building its own
device was the Zune music and video player, which was
discontinued last year after failing to gain traction with
consumers who overwhelmingly prefer the iPod. </p>
<p>Tablets based on Microsoft''s Windows operating system have
struggled since their initial release in 2002. The company''s
current market share? Zero, according to Gartner. </p>
<p>The irony is, of course, Apple didn''t create this market
-- you could argue Microsoft did 10 years ago when Bill Gates
started talking about Tablet PCs,''  said Gartenberg. </p>
<p>Those ill-fated machines used a stylus instead of a touch
interface, joining the roster of tablet computer flops that
includes Hewlett-Packard''s TouchPad -- pulled after just six
weeks on the market -- RIM''s PlayBook and the Motorola Xoom. </p>
<p>Where Apple succeeded was not by trying to force Mac OS
onto a tablet, Gartenberg said. They created something that
was true to the form. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s Deepak Gulati
is holding talks with investors as he and a team of traders
consider leaving the bank to start a hedge fund, said four
people with knowledge of the discussions. </p>
<p>Gulati, JPMorgan''s (JPM) head of global equity proprietary
trading, attended a conference held by Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
in Rome last week to meet backers, said the people, who asked
not to be identified because Gulati''s plans aren''t public. About
20 JPMorgan traders work with Gulati, who probably wouldn''t
start his firm before next year, the people said. </p>
<p>He follows a growing group of traders who''ve left firms
including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. since the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008 triggered a
global financial crisis and prompted regulators to try and limit
risk-taking by banks. </p>
<p>The U.S. Congress in 2010 approved the so-called Volcker
rule, named after former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker,
to curtail banks from using their own capital to make wagers on
stocks and bonds. While the provision hasn''t yet gone into
effect, firms have been shutting down proprietary trading desks
to comply with the law. </p>
<p>JPMorgan spokesman Patrick Burton declined to comment on
Gulati''s plans. The trader, who is based in Zurich, didn''t
return a call to his office seeking comment. </p>
<h2>Volcker Rule </h2>
<p>The bank decided in 2010 to move Gulati and other
proprietary traders to its asset management business to comply
with the Volcker rule, because money would be invested on behalf
of clients. The New York-based company selected Mike Stewart to
oversee the 50 relocated traders, a person briefed on the
decision said in February 2011. The bank was considering giving
them about $2 billion of so-called seed capital, which would be
replaced with money from outside investors over time, according
to another person with knowledge of the discussions. </p>
<p>Stewart, who had been co-head of JPMorgan''s global emerging
markets business, has since left to start Whard Stewart Asset
Management Ltd., a London-based hedge fund. </p>
<p>Gulati joined JPMorgan in 2003 from Dresdner Kleinwort
Ltd., according to his registration with the U.K.''s Financial
Services Authority. </p>
<p>U.S. lawmakers have called for the Volcker rule to be
stiffened after JPMorgan disclosed last month that its chief
investment office lost at least $2 billion trading derivatives.
Prior to the disclosure, JPMorgan and other lenders had urged
regulators to relax parts of the provision, arguing that strict
interpretation of the rule could stop banks from hedging risks. </p>
<p>Gulati''s division is separate to the unit responsible for
the JPMorgan losses. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) unveiled its own
Windows-powered tablet computer called Surface, altering its
strategy of focusing on software and relying on partners to make
the machines in a renewed attempt to take on Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s iPad. </p>
<p>The tablet has a 10.6-inch display and will run the new
version of Microsoft''s operating system, Chief Executive Officer
Steve Ballmer said at an event yesterday at Milk Studios in Los
Angeles. The device''s cover serves as a full keyboard with a
track pad. Surface will be available later this year. </p>
<p>The world''s largest software maker is stepping up its
assault on the tablet market as consumers choose the devices
over laptops, weakening personal-computer sales and curbing
Windows revenue. The new strategy threatens to sour Microsoft''s
relationship with some PC makers, many of which have been
investing to develop their own Windows 8 tablets and may not
want to compete directly with Microsoft. </p>
<p>What can I say? Hell froze over -- this is totally
antithetical to their core business, said Michael Gartenberg,
an analyst at Gartner Inc. They''re taking their destiny into
their own hands. It''s a bold move, but it''s a very risky one.
This could turn into Microsoft''s next Zune or its next Xbox. </p>
<p>Microsoft advanced 2.9 percent to $30.70 at the close in
New York, and has climbed 18 percent this year. Apple increased
0.3 percent to $587.41. </p>
<h2>Two Versions </h2>
<p>The company wants to release Windows 8, the new version of
its software that is optimized for touch-screen tablets, in time
for the end-of-year holidays and will have a version for x86
chips from Intel Corp. and for ones based on ARM Holdings Plc''s
technology, which is also used in the iPad. The Surface tablet
will be available in versions running both chip designs. </p>
<p>Microsoft said the Surface''s price will be announced closer
to when the devices are available and will be competitive with
a comparable ARM tablet or Intel Ultrabook-class PC. </p>
<p>The version for ARM will go on sale when Windows 8 is
released. The Intel-based version will be available about 90
days later, Microsoft said in a statement. </p>
<p>The ARM version of Surface weighs less than 1.5 pounds (680
grams), is 9.3 millimeters (0.37 inches) thick, has a magnesium
case and will be powered by an Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) Tegra processor, the
company said at the event. Surface also has a built-in
kickstand. </p>
<p>The Surface is something new that we think people will
absolutely love, Ballmer said. </p>
<h2>PC Market </h2>
<p>Windows 8 will arrive amid a deteriorating PC market --
research firm Gartner Inc. on June 15 cut its 2012 PC shipment
growth forecast to 2.7 percent from 4.4 percent. Tablet
shipments, by comparison, are forecast to almost double to 116
million units this year, Gartner estimates. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s entry into the tablet market also comes as
challengers such as Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) and Research In Motion
Ltd. have failed to derail Apple''s dominance with their own
tablets. The worldwide tablet market is estimated to reach $78.7
billion this year, according to research firm DisplaySearch. </p>
<p>LG Electronics Inc. (066570), the world''s No. 4 mobile-phone maker,
will sideline tablet development to focus more on smaller
devices rather than compete head-on with Apple Inc.''s iPad, the
Seoul-based company said in an e-mail today. LG introduced its
second tablet, named Optimus Pad LTE, earlier this year. </p>
<p>Microsoft is also teaming up with PC makers like Acer Inc.,
Toshiba Corp. and Asustek Computer Inc. to build tablets with
Windows 8, which will be called Windows RT for versions running
on ARM-based chips. </p>
<h2>Apple''s Dominance </h2>
<p>Working with partners is Microsoft''s more traditional way
of operating. Apple''s success with the iPad may be pushing the
company to seek greater control over the hardware design so it
works seamlessly with the software, like Apple does. </p>
<p>Still, gaining ground against Apple won''t be easy. Even as
companies including Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Samsung Electronics Co.
release new tablets running Google Inc. (GOOG)''s Android operating
system, Apple''s iPad continues to dominate the market.
Researcher IDC predicts the iPad will account for 62.5 percent
of global shipments this year, up from 58.2 percent last year. </p>
<p>The last time Microsoft opted to make its own hardware
because its partners weren''t gaining traction against Apple, the
company produced the Zune music player. It didn''t fare any
better against the iPod, and Microsoft discontinued the product
last year. </p>
<h2>Software Assets'' </h2>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum, Microsoft''s Xbox console
is now the top-selling game machine, with 67 million units
shipped. The Xbox 360 device, which also streams television and
media content, has helped Microsoft stake a claim to customers''
living rooms. </p>
<p>Sarah Rotman Epps, an analyst at Forrester Research, said
Microsoft''s focus on trying to best Apple in hardware design
could backfire if Surface tablets don''t offer software that
stands out. </p>
<p>What they didn''t show were Kinect, SmartGlass and other
software assets that could be key differentiators against the
iPad, she said. The months are ticking by, and the
announcement left more questions than answers about how
successful these devices will be. </p>
<p>After seeing early prototypes from its hardware partners,
Microsoft probably wanted to show the industry what it thinks is
a good implementation of its tablet ambitions, said Ben Bajarin,
an analyst at technology consulting firm Creative Strategies. </p>
<h2>Shifting Focus </h2>
<p>A lot of their traditional partners have not really been
focused on the tablet market, and were planning early on to go
after new designs for traditional notebooks and desktops,
Bajarin said. This is an effort to drive the category in the
right direction. </p>
<p>In what may be a concession to PC partners, Microsoft will
sell the device only online and in its own retail stores, which
will number 20 by the end of the month, Gartenberg said.
Microsoft also could let vendors build their own Surface
tablets, which may sell for $499 to $699, and pay for marketing
the devices, Bajarin said. </p>
<p>Since the release of International Business Machines
Corp.''s first PC in 1981, Microsoft has focused on software for
the machines and left design and branding to hardware makers.
While the company has in the past decade played a larger role in
working with some PC makers on design, it has shied away from
developing the machines and selling them under the Microsoft
brand. </p>
<h2>Profit Margins </h2>
<p>Ballmer''s comments at the event indicated that Microsoft no
longer wanted to rely on its hardware partners to translate its
vision for Windows into compelling devices, said Gartenberg and
Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. </p>
<p>They clearly want to make sure at least one Windows 8
tablet is seen as a premium product, offering a premium
experience to consumers, Enderle said. Now they need to
execute, or they just handed Apple an early Christmas present. </p>
<p>The addition of a tablet or other hardware device may erode
profitability in the Windows business, which now sells just
software with operating margins of more than 60 percent. By
comparison, computer maker Dell Inc.''s operating margin for the
most recent fiscal year was about 7 percent. </p>
<p>We are certainly running a business, Ballmer said
backstage at yesterday''s event, though he declined to discuss
financial details. There won''t be an advantage from a cost
perspective over our OEMs, he said, referring to PC partners. </p>
<p>Sales in Microsoft''s Windows division have fallen short of
analysts'' estimates in four of the past six quarters, partially
because consumers are defecting to the iPad. </p>
<p>Investors will like the device initially and then will go
through the question of what does this do to profit margins,
said Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities in
Portland, Oregon, who rates the shares sector perform. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s largest
drugmaker, said in a securities filing that it has paid
$896 million to resolve about 60 percent of the cases alleging
its menopause drugs caused cancer in women. </p>
<p>Pfizer has now settled about 6,000 lawsuits that claim
Prempro and other hormone-replacement drugs caused breast
cancer, and it has set aside an additional $330 million to
resolve the remaining 4,000 suits, according to a filing with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>
<p>The reserve means New York-based Pfizer has committed more
than $1.2 billion to resolving claims that its Wyeth and
Pharmacia  Upjohn units failed to properly warn women about the
menopause drugs'' health risk. Based on the May 10 filing, the
company is paying an average of about $150,000 a case. </p>
<p>It''s good for the company not to let this litigation
linger, Les Funtleyder, a New York-based fund manager at
Miller Tabak  Co. in New York who holds Pfizer shares, said
yesterday in a phone interview. Resolving these cases gives
investors one less thing to worry about. </p>
<p>More than 6 million women took Prempro and related
menopause drugs to treat symptoms including hot flashes and mood
swings before a 2002 study highlighted their links to cancer.
Wyeth''s sales of the medicines, which are still on the market,
exceeded $2 billion before the release of the Women''s Health
Initiative, a study sponsored by the National Institutes of
Health. </p>
<h2>Litigation Scorecard </h2>
<p>Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Premarin,
Wyeth''s estrogen-based drug, with progestin-laden Provera, made
by Upjohn, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth combined the two
hormones in its Prempro pill. Pfizer completed its $68 billion
purchase of Wyeth in 2009. </p>
<p>Pfizer and its units have lost 11 of 21 cases over the
menopause drugs decided by juries since trials began in 2006,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The drugmaker got some of the verdicts against it thrown
out after trial or had the awards reduced. It resolved some of
the verdicts through settlements, while other decisions are on
appeal. </p>
<p>After nine years of litigation involving this medicine,
we are confident in our medicine, our track record of success in
court where we have won eight of the last 10 final verdicts at
trial, and in our ability to resolve these cases on appropriate
terms, Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said in an e-mailed
statement. </p>
<h2>10,000 Claims </h2>
<p>Pfizer officials said that the $330 million reserve was an
estimate and they couldn''t be sure it would cover the remaining
cases given the uncertainties inherent in this product
liability litigation, according to the SEC filing. </p>
<p>At the height of the litigation, Pfizer faced more than
10,000 claims that its menopause drugs caused breast cancer,
according to lawyers for former users. Those cases included more
than 8,000 claims consolidated in federal court in Arkansas and
other suits in state courts in Pennsylvania, Nevada and
Minnesota. </p>
<p>A majority of those cases have been resolved, according to
court and securities filings. A federal judge in Arkansas has
sent other suits back to their home courts for trial. For
example, two were returned to federal court in Connecticut to be
considered by juries. </p>
<h2>Punitive Damages </h2>
<p>In April, a federal jury in New Haven, Connecticut, ordered
Pfizer to pay at least $4 million in damages to a woman who
developed breast cancer. The panel also ordered Pfizer to pay
punitive damages over its handling of Prempro. A judge is still
weighing how much, if any, to assess in punitives. </p>
<p>Lawyers for Margaret Fraser asked U.S. District Judge Janet Arterton in a May 29 court filing to award $8 million in
punitive damages to adequately punish Wyeth for its outrageous
conduct in connection with the drug. Wyeth is seeking a new
trial in the case and disputes the plaintiff''s request for
punishment damages, according to court filings. </p>
<p>Last month, a separate federal jury in Bridgeport,
Connecticut, found Pfizer wasn''t liable for the breast-cancer
death of a woman who died after taking the company''s menopause
medicines. The panel in that case concluded that Wyeth officials
properly warned Lynn Moss of the drug''s risks. </p>
<h2>More Trials </h2>
<p>Zoe Littlepage, a Houston-based lawyer who represents women
who haven''t settled their suits against Pfizer, said she''s
preparing for another round of trials over the claims. </p>
<p>The law firms that are left after these settlements are
eager to see that every woman gets her day in court,
Littlepage said in an e-mailed statement. We have worked long
and hard to get these cases to trial. </p>
<p>Esther Berezofsky, a New Jersey-based lawyer representing
women suing over the menopause drugs, said her clients believe
their claims are worth more than $150,000 average paid in other
cases that settled. </p>
<p>We''ll consider settling when the company decides to
fairly compensate the women I represent for the horrendous
injuries caused by these drugs, Berezofsky said in a telephone
interview. </p>
<p>The consolidated case in Arkansas is In re Prempro
Products, 03-cv-015070-WRW, U.S. District Court, Eastern
District of Arkansas (Little Rock). </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s $2 billion
trading loss stemmed from profit-seeking bets rather than hedges
meant to mitigate loan losses, as Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has described them, banking analyst Meredith Whitney said. </p>
<p>It''s very hard to argue that what Jamie Dimon is now on
the Hill for is a hedge, Whitney said today in a radio
interview on Bloomberg Surveillance with Tom Keene and Ken Prewitt as the bank chief testified at a hearing of the House
Financial Services Committee in Washington. A credit hedge in
banking should be a loan-loss provision, plain and simple.
Anything else is a proprietary bet. </p>
<p>Dimon has described the loss as stemming from a hedge that
morphed into something I can''t justify. He has publicly
opposed the so-called Volcker rule, a Dodd-Frank Act provision
meant to limit deposit-taking lenders from making proprietary
trades, or bets with their own money. </p>
<p>Of the large banks, JPMorgan has the lowest loan-to-
deposit ratio, said Whitney, CEO of Meredith Whitney Advisory
Group LLC. It didn''t frankly seem to bother anyone there
because they clearly were making money in this trading book. </p>
<p>Whitney, 42, also disputed Dimon''s claim that bank
regulation may curb lending. Dimon, 56, confronted Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke at a public forum last year,
blaming excessive regulation for slowing the U.S. economic
recovery. </p>
<p>It stymies the velocity of money in the system, you have
to hold more capital, Whitney said. But in terms of lending,
absolutely not. </p>
<p>Dimon''s performance at a Senate hearing last week went more
smoothly than Whitney expected, she said. The New York-based
bank''s shares rose 1.6 percent after his testimony last week and
advanced again today, climbing 2.1 percent to $35.36 at 2:37
p.m. in New York trading. </p>
<p>I was very surprised because it''s a very difficult trade
to explain, she said. He charms, he''s incredible. He gave
the senators a massage, they gave him a massage back. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s decision to
change how it measures trading risk worsened rather than
triggered the company''s $2 billion loss, Chief Executive Officer
Jamie Dimon told Congress today. </p>
<p>It may have aggravated what happened, I wouldn''t say it
was the cause of what happened, Dimon told the House Financial
Services Committee during a hearing in Washington. </p>
<p>Regulators are probing why JPMorgan changed the gauge
called value-at-risk, or VaR, for its chief investment office in
mid-January before losses began piling up on derivatives held by
the unit. Dimon, 56, said May 10 that the new VaR erroneously
pegged risk at about half the level of the old formula, making
the potential damage look smaller. </p>
<p>JPMorgan reported the figure in its April 13 earnings
statement without telling investors about the new formula. That
has caught the attention of regulators including Securities and
Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro, who said today that
voluntary disclosures on trading risk in a news release will be
scrutinized as if they were reported in formal quarterly filings
where such information is usually published. </p>
<p>The measure is not required to be disclosed in the
earnings release, but if you choose to speak to it, you must
speak truthfully and completely, Schapiro, who turned 57
today, told the House panel. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon, who has been criticized by lawmakers for
serving on the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,
said district banks benefit from industry leaders'' input. </p>
<p>If I had a board, I''d want to hear from a lot of
different types of people, Dimon said today at a hearing of
the House Financial Services Committee in Washington. It''d be
funny to be talking about global markets and not have someone
involved in the global markets at the table. It certainly does
not have to be me. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s trading loss of more than $2 billion has
rekindled concern that the New York Fed, the company''s principal
regulator, is too cozy with Wall Street. Senator Bernie Sanders,
a Vermont independent, along with Democrats Barbara Boxer of
California and Mark Begich of Alaska, introduced legislation
last month that would remove the industry''s executives from the
12 regional Fed banks'' boards. </p>
<p>Congress created the Fed almost a century ago with public
and private features, including putting three bankers on each of
the district boards along with six other directors who represent
the borrowing public. They play no part in bank supervision. </p>
<p>The board basically sits around and talks about the
economy, Dimon said today. It''s more of an informational,
advisory group. </p>
<p>The Fed reviews capital plans of the largest U.S. banks,
including JPMorgan, to make sure they can withstand economic
stress and in March approved Dimon''s proposal to increase the
dividend and buy back shares. The company subsequently suspended
the repurchase program. </p>
<h2>Fed Bailout </h2>
<p>Timothy F. Geithner, now the secretary of the U.S. Treasury
Department, led the New York Fed in 2008 when it bailed out
insurer American International Group Inc. and took on assets
from Bear Stearns Cos. to help JPMorgan buy the investment bank. </p>
<p>The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act ended the practice of banker-
directors having a vote in electing regional presidents, a move
that New York Fed President William C. Dudley said in a
September interview that he supported. </p>
<p>Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke told the Joint Economic
Committee on June 7 that he would be willing to work with
Congress on a bill that would remove bankers from Fed boards. </p>
<p>If Congress wants to change it, of course we will work
with lawmakers, Bernanke said in response to a question from
Sanders. Congress set this up, and we''ve made it into
something useful and valuable, he said. </p>
<p>Bernanke said the Fed''s duties have been examined carefully
in the aftermath of the credit crisis, including by the
Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of
Congress. </p>
<p>There were no actual conflicts of interest found, he
said. The Fed has a firewall so that the bankers do not have
any information or ability to influence supervisory decisions. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) caught
regulators off guard with a trading loss of at least $2 billion
because the bank''s reporting lacked enough detail to raise any
alarm, the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency said. </p>
<p>In hindsight, if the reporting were more robust or
granular, we believe we may have had an inkling of the size and
potential complexity and risk of the position, Comptroller
Thomas Curry said today at a hearing of the House Financial
Services Committee in Washington. </p>
<p>Lawmakers are challenging regulators and JPMorgan Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon about a loss on credit derivatives
at the company''s chief investment office. Dimon told a Senate
panel last week that the trade, originally designed as a hedge
at the New York-based lender, changed into something I cannot
publicly defend. </p>
<p>Representative Carolyn Maloney, the New York Democrat,
pressed Curry on whether the loss would prompt Curry to shift
more resources to London, where JPMorgan''s loss originated.
Curry said this month that his office has five examiners at the
JPMorgan''s London office and 65 at the bank''s headquarters. </p>
<p>We will use our experience here and our review of
JPMorgan Chase to reevaluate the numbers and strength of
the personnel in our London office, Curry said today. We
also bring to bear in our targeted examinations and overall
supervision of the bank, the entire strength of the OCC in terms
of expertise and number of examiners, which are close to 2,500
individuals. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE)''s vaccine Prevnar 13,
used to prevent pneumococcal disease, should be given to adults
with weakened immune systems, according to a U.S. panel that
recommends vaccination schedules to doctors. </p>
<p>The U.S. Advisory Committee on Vaccine Practices voted
today that people with AIDS, cancer, organ transplants, advanced
kidney disease and other immune-weakening conditions should
receive the vaccine. The recommendation includes people who''ve
already had Merck  Co. (MRK)''s Pneumovax 23, a competitor to New
York-based Pfizer''s product. </p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration in December approved
Prevnar 13 for use in adults at least 50 years old. The vaccine
panel, part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta, recommends vaccinations to doctors and has yet to
decide whether all adults 50 years old and older should get
Prevnar 13. Such a ruling would be a major sales boost to sales
of the product, Tony Butler, an analyst with Barclays Capital,
said in a note to clients in February. </p>
<p>Pfizer said it will continue to urge the panel to support
giving the vaccine to all adults at least 50 years old. A
company study of Prevnar in 84,000 people 65 and older should
have results by 2013, the drugmaker said in a statement. </p>
<p>If recommended in the older population, Pfizer''s vaccine
would go head-to-head with Merck''s product. It is important
for clinicians to continue to focus on implementing the ACIP''s
long-standing recommendation for use of only Pneumovax 23 to
help protect all adults aged 65 and older, as well as adults 19
and older, Mark Feinberg, chief science of Whitehouse Station,
New Jersey-based Merck''s vaccine division, said in a statement. </p>
<p>The World Health Organization estimates that 1.6 million
people die each year from pneumococcal infections. Pfizer''s
vaccine generated $941 million in the first quarter, and was the
drugmaker''s third-best-selling product behind the cholesterol
pill Lipitor and pain drug Lyrica. </p>
<p>Pfizer fell less than 1 percent to $22.67 at the close in
New York. Merck declined less than 1 percent to $39.21. </p>

<p>BP Plc (BP/) was the high bidder on 43
leases to drill in the central Gulf of Mexico where two years
ago its Macondo well exploded, causing the largest U.S. offshore
oil spill. The U.S. auction raised $1.7 billion. </p>
<p>Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) offered $406.6 million, or 24 percent
of all the bids, followed by Statoil (STL) ASA with $333.3 million,
the Interior Department said. Stavanger, Norway-based Statoil
bid $157 million for a single tract, a record in the region,
Tommy Beaudreau, director of the department''s Bureau of Ocean
Energy Management, said today. BP''s total bids were $239.5
million. </p>
<p>As the largest leaseholder in the deep waters of the Gulf
of Mexico, we remain committed to continuing investment in this
important U.S. energy source, Scott Dean, a BP spokesman, said
today by phone. </p>
<p>The Obama administration, pressured by Republicans to boost
domestic oil production, auctioned tracts off the coast of
Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi that it said may produce more
than 1 billion barrels of oil. The previous auction in the
central Gulf, about a month before the April 2010 BP disaster,
raised $949.3 million for the U.S. </p>
<p>BP is acquiring leases in a region where the London-based
company lost control of the Macondo well in a blowout that
destroyed a $365 million drilling rig, killed 11 workers and
spewed about 4.9 million of barrels of oil. </p>
<h2>In Business'' </h2>
<p>Gulf of Mexico is back in business, Interior Secretary
Ken Salazar said as the sale began today in New Orleans. He said
the companies can begin preparing for exploration immediately. </p>
<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Apache Corp. (APA), LLOG
Exploration Offshore LLC, Stone Energy Corp. (SGY), Noble Energy Inc. (NBL)
and ConocoPhillips (COP) were among the 10 biggest bidders, according
to a list posted today on the Interior Department website. </p>
<p>The administration is opening the central Gulf as
Republicans in Congress demand accelerated domestic output to
add jobs and reduce dependence on overseas sources. The BP oil
spill prompted an overhaul of rules for deepwater drilling after
a six-month halt in the Gulf to review safety. </p>
<p>If we continue to drill in the Gulf of Mexico, especially
in deep water, we will have another spill, Jacqueline Savitz,
vice president for North America at Washington-based
environmental group Oceana, said in a phone interview today. </p>
<h2>Deep Waters </h2>
<p>Leases in waters deeper than 1,600 meters (5,250 feet)
accounted for more than 53 percent of all the high bids, or $906
million, and almost 10 times more than tracts in water 400
meters or shallower, according to the Interior Department. </p>
<p>Production in the Gulf region increased 6.2 percent to 1.41
million barrels a day in March, and represented more than a
fifth of the U.S. crude production for the month, according to
the Energy Department. </p>
<p>With oil trading at about $80 a barrel on global markets,
the Gulf of Mexico is the world''s most profitable place to
produce oil, because other nations set higher taxes on oil
companies, said Fadel Gheit, an analyst at Oppenheimer  Co. in
New York. </p>
<p>Whether it''s the U.K., whether it''s Algeria, Nigeria,
West Africa, Russia, anywhere you go, the effective tax rate is
very high, Gheit said in an interview. The Gulf is well
developed, the whole area is basically very well mapped, there
are not too many surprises, the industry has all the services
needed. </p>
<p>Following the BP disaster, the Interior Department revamped
its oversight of drilling, dividing the leasing function from
enforcement of safety rules and collection of production
royalties. The department also added standards on well design,
casing and cementing, and introduced a requirement for subsea
oil-spill containment system. </p>
<p>A nonprofit group commissioned by the agency also
recommended that U.S. inspectors be allowed to fly to rigs on
company-leases helicopters and live for a time with workers, the
National Research Council said in report released yesterday. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world''s largest
software maker, will release a new version of the Windows Phone
program in handsets this fall, part of a broad effort to gain
ground against Apple Inc. and Google Inc. (GOOG) in mobile devices. </p>
<p>Windows Phone 8 has the same core software as the new
Windows 8 operating system for personal computers and tablets,
meaning it can be used in a variety of phone models at different
prices, the company said at an event in San Francisco today. </p>
<p>Microsoft finished the first quarter with a 2.2 percent
share of the mobile-phone operating system market, dwarfed by
Apple''s iOS and Google''s Android software, according to
researcher IDC. Along with the unveiling earlier this week of
its own tablet computer, called Surface, the Redmond,
Washington-based company is stepping up its challenge as
consumers rely more on mobile-computing devices. </p>
<p>Windows Phone 8 is a significant improvement, said Al Hilwa, an analyst at IDC. It brings the capabilities up to par
with Android. The question of whether this pace of research and
development is fast enough remains, because of the sheer
velocity with which Android is moving. </p>
<p>Android was the smartphone market leader in the first
quarter, with a 59 percent share, and Apple (AAPL) followed with 23
percent, IDC said. Symbian software from Nokia Oyj (NOK1V), the Finnish
handset maker Microsoft teamed up with last year to create new
smartphones running Windows, trailed in third place with a 6.8
percent slice. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), UBS AG (UBSN) and two
other banks won an attempt to block U.K. prosecutors from
seizing documents that Italian authorities sought to use at a
criminal trial over derivatives, a London judge ruled today. </p>
<p>The lenders, along with Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and Depfa Bank
Plc, won a ruling quashing a request for information from the
U.K. Serious Fraud Office, Judge Peter Gross said in a judgment
issued today in London. The SFO had an obvious lack of
authority in the case, Gross said. </p>
<p>It is with considerable reluctance that I have come to
the conclusion that assistance should not be given in this case
in response to the letter of request from the Milan
prosecutor, Gross said. </p>
<p>Prosecutors in Milan accused the four banks, which arranged
swaps for the city to restructure its debt, of misleading
municipal officials and earning 101 million euros ($128 million)
in hidden fees from the deals. The banks, which deny the fraud
charges, settled with the city government in a separate civil
case in March and agreed to unwind its interest-rate swaps,
which adjusted payments on 1.7 billion euros of bonds sold in
2005. </p>
<p>The banks told the London court in May that the SFO
shouldn''t be allowed to use coercive measures that wouldn''t
be available to prosecutors in Italy. </p>
<h2>Considerable Sympathy </h2>
<p>In its ruling today, the court expressed a considerable
degree of sympathy for the position of both the Home Secretary
and the SFO, David Jones, a spokesman for the U.K. prosecution
agency, said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Officials at the four banks all declined to comment. Milan
prosecutor Alfredo Robledo didn''t immediately return calls
seeking comment on the ruling. </p>
<p>The prosecutor leading the Milan case used the accounts of
an Italian bank on a similar transaction to show that lenders
set terms in their favor in swap deals. A witness testified
during a trial in Milan over the derivatives sales that the
city''s swaps may have broken rules on how municipalities can use
derivatives, partly because they were used to raise funds
instead of hedging risk. </p>
<p>The case is: The Queen on the application of UBS Limited
v. Serious Fraud Office, CO/3165/2012, High Court of Justice,
Queen''s Bench Division. </p>

<p>Canada Pension Plan Investment Board
beat Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) in an auction to be the lead
investor in a $1 billion transaction to take over assets of a
2001 fund managed by private-equity firm Behrman Capital. </p>
<p>Canada Pension, the country''s second-biggest public pension
manager, agreed to commit as much as $644.4 million to Behrman
Capital PEP LP, a new fund with a six-year life that will buy
assets from the original Behrman fund, according to marketing
documents. The new fund is seeking $1.07 billion. </p>
<p>The transaction gives investors the option of exiting their
stakes in Behrman Capital III LP, a $1.2 billion fund formed 11
years ago. They can also choose to invest in the new pool, which
has reserved $100 million for such rollover commitments,
according to the documents, copies of which were obtained by
Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>Behrman, based in New York, is among a number of private-
equity firms seeking to resolve the future of funds that are
reaching the end of their designated lives without having sold
all their investments. Willis Stein  Partners, a buyout firm
that last raised capital more than a decade ago, is trying to
divest most of its remaining holdings, two people familiar with
the deal said in February. </p>
<h2>Five Companies </h2>
<p>Linda Sims, a spokeswoman for Toronto-based Canada Pension,
declined to comment, as did Bill Murphy, a managing director at
Cogent Partners, which handled the auction for Behrman Capital.
Grant Behrman, co-founder of the firm, didn''t return a call for
comment, while Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs,
didn''t immediately respond to an e-mail. </p>
<p>The new fund will use 75 percent of commitments to purchase
existing stakes in five companies primarily held by Behrman
Capital III. The companies are Ark Holding Co., ILC Holdings
Inc., New ILC Dover Inc., Pelican Products Inc. and Selig
Sealing Holdings Inc., the documents show. Other funds have
minority stakes in the companies, including Behrman Capital IV
LP, which raised $251 million in 2007. </p>
<p>The remaining capital will be used to fund new investments,
primarily in the health-care, defense, specialty manufacturing
or business-to-business outsourcing industries in the U.S. </p>
<p>The deal will give Behrman Capital III investors net
proceeds of $780.6 million after fees, representing 102.4 percent
of net asset value as of Dec. 31. The general partner will
receive a cut of profits from the transaction and 20 percent of
a $40 million exit fee paid by the portfolio companies, according
to one of the documents. </p>
<h2>Fee Changes </h2>
<p>Behrman Capital reduced the proposed management fee on the
new fund to 0.75 percent from an originally proposed 1.25
percent in March. It has increased the proposed carried interest
fee to 20 percent from 15 percent. </p>
<p>Behrman Capital III is near the end of its life, having
already received investor approval for two of three one-year
extensions beyond its 10-year term. </p>
<p>The deal has passed muster with the advisory boards of Fund
III and Fund IV and is pending approval from Behrman investors,
who face a deadline of today, the documents show. </p>
<p>Behrman Capital was founded by brothers Grant Behrman and
Darryl Behrman in 1991. Darryl passed away in February 2002. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank, is poised to more than double the value of its
investment in London Metal Exchange shares bought seven months
ago from the U.K. unit of bankrupt MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ) </p>
<p>JPMorgan is the biggest investor in the LME, with 1.4
million shares valued at 150.6 million pounds ($236.8 million)
after Hong Kong Exchanges  Clearing Ltd. agreed to buy the
London bourse at 107.60 pounds a share. The New York-based bank
increased its stake in November when it agreed to buy 600,000
shares from MF Global U.K. Ltd. at 41.92 pounds apiece. </p>
<p>To say the price is very full and very generous to LME
shareholders is an understatement, said Peter Lenardos, an
analyst at RBC Capital Markets in London. The capital gain for
them is massive. It''s an outstanding investment. </p>
<p>Hong Kong Exchanges, which owns the fifth-largest equity
market by market capitalization, offered 1.39 billion pounds on
June 15 for the LME, which handled a record $15.4 trillion of
contracts last year. The takeover would give the Asian exchange
its first commodities business and the London bourse better
access to China, the biggest user of everything from aluminum to
zinc. LME shareholders will vote on the bid by the end of July. </p>
<p>MF Global, based in New York, filed the eighth-largest U.S.
bankruptcy on Oct. 31 with debt of almost $40 billion after
making wrong-way bets on sovereign debt. The 41.92 pounds paid
by JPMorgan for MF Global''s shares compared with a previous sale
of LME stock at 4.925 pounds in July. The 135-year-old LME had
said in September it received several expressions of
interest for the exchange. </p>
<h2>Final Offers'' </h2>
<p>While a condition on a price adjustment for any
subsequent sale of the shares at a higher price was part of the
sale negotiations, none of the nine parties who made final
offers were prepared to agree to this condition, Mike Pink,
joint special administrator of MF Global U.K. at KPMG LLP, said
in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Kate Haywood, a London-based spokeswoman for JPMorgan,
declined to comment. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) raised its stake in the LME by
330,000 shares to 1.23 million in the year through September,
according to U.K. Companies House filings. Lehman Brothers
International Europe, the bankrupt London unit of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., transferred its 330,000 LME shares on
July 1, according to Companies House. Goldman has never said
whether it acquired those shares. </p>
<h2>Metdist Trading </h2>
<p>Goldman''s total stake is valued at 132.3 million pounds
under the terms of Hong Kong Exchanges'' offer. Joanna Carss, a
spokeswoman for Goldman in London, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Metdist Ltd. and Metdist Trading Ltd., U.K. metals trading
companies owned by the Bagri family, have a combined 1.21
million LME shares, making the group the third-largest
shareholder. Its stake is valued at 130.4 million pounds, or
about 165 times Metdist Ltd.''s profit in 2011. The company''s
fiscal year ended March 31. </p>
<p>Raj Bagri, who was chairman of the LME from 1993 to 2002,
is a director of Metdist Ltd. and Metdist Trading Ltd.,
according to Companies House filings in 2011. His son Apurv
Bagri is also named as a director of the two companies. </p>
<p>Sucden Financial Ltd. with 362,000 shares, would make about
39 million pounds if it sold its stake. The broker''s profit in
2011 was 9.04 million pounds on operating profit of 10.9 million
pounds, according to a Companies House filing. </p>
<p>Triland Metals Ltd., which has 300,000 shares, would gain
32.3 million pounds on the sale of the LME. The broker''s profit
for 2011 was 9.68 million pounds, compared with 12.9 million
pounds the year before. Its fiscal year ended March 31,
according to Companies House. </p>
<h2>LME Shares </h2>
<p>The LME issues two share classes. There are 12.9 million
ordinary shares conferring ownership and voting rights.
JPMorgan, Metdist Trading, Sucden Financial and Triland Metals
are category 1 members of the bourse, giving them the right to
trade on the floor of the exchange. Goldman is a category 2
member, which means it can''t participate in the so-called ring,
home to London''s last open-outcry trading. </p>
<p>The takeover needs the approval of the U.K. Financial
Services Authority as well as LME shareholders. It doesn''t need
shareholder consent in Hong Kong. </p>

<p>U.S. House members criticized
regulators yesterday for failing to detect JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM)''s loss of at least $2 billion on risky derivatives trades
and pressed for additional measures to ensure similar losses
don''t occur in other banks. </p>
<p>The heads of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the Securities and Exchange
Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission, along with
a senior Federal Reserve official offered testimony about the
loss at a House Financial Services Committee hearing in
Washington. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, who began his
testimony later, described the loss as embarrassing. </p>
<p>Lawmakers pressed regulators to explain how they monitored
activities U.S. banks conduct overseas. The trades that
triggered JPMorgan''s loss were conducted in London, potentially
beyond the reach of U.S. derivatives regulators. </p>
<p>Dimon defended the company''s disclosures of a $2 billion
trading loss as regulators and lawmakers questioned whether the
largest U.S. bank misled investors. </p>
<p>We disclosed what we knew when we knew it, Dimon,
making his second appearance on Capitol Hill in less than a
week, said yesterday at a House Financial Services Committee
hearing in Washington that exceeded four hours. </p>
<p>Comptroller Thomas J. Curry said his agency is reviewing
its staffing inside JPMorgan''s London operations in the wake of
the loss. SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro told lawmakers that
JPMorgan could pay a penalty if the agency concludes that the
bank improperly disclosed the risk that contributed to the loss.
The SEC has a wide panoply of sanctions and penalties at its
disposal in pursuing a case against JPMorgan and the bank could
pay penalties if investigators find that it has violated
disclosure or other rules, Schapiro said. </p>
<p>Scott Alvarez, the Fed''s general counsel, said the central
bank is reviewing JPMorgan''s risk management practices. </p>
<p>Still, regulators didn''t provide new information about the
loss and lawmakers used the hearing to reprise the broader
debate over financial regulation. Committee Chairman Spencer
Bachus pointed to the regulators bunched at the witness table as
an example of the continued complexity of financial oversight. </p>
<p>Dimon''s opening statement was nearly identical to his
remarks in front of the Senate Banking Committee last week.
During that hearing, Dimon apologized for the losses and said he
felt terrible that shareholders would lose money because of
the chief investment office''s trading strategy. </p>
<p>Dimon also said that Congress should limit the
international reach of Dodd-Frank Act swaps regulations. In
addition, Dimon said that district banks of the Federal Reserve
benefit by having industry leaders'' input. Dimon has been
criticized by lawmakers for serving on the board of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York. </p>
<p>Yesterday''s hearing was the first held by the House on the
trading losses, which have drawn inquiries from the SEC, CFTC
and Department of Justice. </p>
<p>The SEC''s review of JPMorgan''s trading loss has focused on
how JPMorgan disclosed a change to a complicated risk
calculation. When companies disclose their value at risk or
VaR, they must speak truthfully and completely, Schapiro
said. </p>
<p>Lawmakers on the House committee, much like those on its
Senate counterpart, have benefited from JPMorgan''s campaign
donations. </p>

<h2>JPMorgan Hedges Were Really Prop Trades, Whitney Says </h2>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s $2 billion trading loss stemmed from
profit-seeking bets rather than hedges meant to mitigate loan
losses, as Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has described
them, banking analyst Meredith Whitney said. </p>
<p>Whitney made the remarks yesterday in a radio interview on
Bloomberg Surveillance with Tom Keene and Ken Prewitt as the
bank chief testified at a hearing of the House Financial
Services Committee in Washington. A credit hedge in banking
should be a loan-loss provision, plain and simple. Anything else
is a proprietary bet. </p>
<p>Whitney, 42, also disputed Dimon''s claim that bank
regulation may curb lending. </p>

<h2>Himes Asks Why No One Knew About JPMorgan Trading Loss </h2>
<p>U.S. Representative James Himes, a Connecticut Democrat and
a member of the House Financial Services Committee, talked about
yesterday''s testimony to the panel by JPMorgan Chase  Co. Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon about the bank''s $2 billion
trading loss. </p>
<p>Himes spoke with Betty Liu and Peter Cook on Bloomberg
Television''s In the Loop. </p>

<h2>Schweikert Says Dimon Did Pretty Good Job'' at Hearing </h2>

Exchange Commission, talked about JPMorgan Chase  Co. Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon ''s testimony before the Senate
Banking Committee yesterday. </p>
<p>Levitt, who spoke with Stephanie Ruhle and Erik Schatzker
on Bloomberg Television''s Market Movers, also discussed
regulations and the outlook for the banking industry. </p>

<p>House''s Frank Says JPMorgan Losses Show Need for Swaps Oversight </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s trading loss of at least $2 billion
strengthens the argument against Republican efforts to cut the
budget of the U.S. derivatives regulator and ease Dodd-Frank Act
swaps rules, said Representative Barney Frank. </p>
<p>Frank said that if a very well-run bank can sustain a
loss of this size, it''s an indication of the problems with
derivatives. Frank, a Massachusetts lawmaker, is the senior
Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee. He made the
remarks at a hearing yesterday looking into the bank''s trading. </p>
<p>The House Agriculture Committee last month postponed a
committee meeting to vote on measures limiting the international
reach of the 2010 regulatory-overhaul law''s swaps regulations
and allow more derivatives trading to occur in federally insured
banks. Financial Services approved the same legislation in
March, before JPMorgan''s derivatives losses were disclosed. </p>
<h2>Compliance Policy </h2>
<h2>U.K. to Give Shareholders Votes on Top Pay, Boost Disclosure </h2>
<p>Public companies in the U.K. will have to give shareholders
binding votes on executive-pay structures every three years,
Business Secretary Vince Cable told lawmakers. </p>
<p>Other measures in the package, to take effect in October
2013, will require companies to publish a single figure for what
each director is paid in total, their pension entitlement and a
chart comparing the company''s performance and the chief
executive officer''s pay. When directors leave, the company will
have to publish promptly a statement of their payoff. </p>
<p>A study last year by the High Pay Commission, a pressure
group that pushes for curbs on top earners, found British
directors'' salaries increased by 64 percent over the past
decade, while the average year-end share price of FTSE 100
companies fell 71 percent. The average annual bonus for
directors rose 187 percent, according to the panel. </p>
<p>There is compelling evidence of a disconnect between pay
and performance in large U.K.-listed companies, Cable said in
a statement to Parliament today. It is right that the
government acts to address this clear market failure. </p>
<p>Cable said he hoped that having votes on pay structures
every three years, rather than annually, will encourage longer-
term thinking. If a company changes its structures, it''ll be
forced to have a fresh vote. </p>
<p>The moves, which will be implemented through amendments to
the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill currently before
Parliament, are aimed partly at ending golden goodbye
packages for departing executives, often criticized as rewards
for failure. The policy on exit payments will be part of the
package that shareholders vote on, and companies won''t be able
to go beyond it. </p>
<h2>Developing Economies Warn of Damage From Basel, Volcker Rules </h2>
<p>Global regulators are being urged by some developing
countries to amend plans that would force banks to boost their
capital and liquid assets, expressing concerns the measures may
harm their economies. </p>
<p>A survey of developing and emerging economies conducted by
the Financial Stability Board revealed concerns that the
measures, drawn up in the wake of the 2008 collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., could have adverse consequences and
may ultimately impact the development of domestic financial
markets in those countries. </p>
<p>The nations are also concerned that U.S. proposals to ban
commercial banks from proprietary trading, known as the Volcker
Rule, may damage their government, corporate securities and
derivatives markets, the FSB said in the report, submitted
yesterday to a meeting of the Group of 20 nations in Los Cabos,
Mexico, and published on the FSB''s website. It didn''t name the
countries included in the survey. </p>
<p>Regulators and lenders have clashed over how to implement
the international bank-capital and liquidity standards, which
are set to become fully effective in 2019. </p>
<p>Specific concerns named in the report include that the new
rules might make it more expensive for lenders to provide so-
called trade finance services, the FSB said. There is also a
more general concern lenders will scale back activities outside
their core markets, the board said. </p>
<h2>EU Lawmakers Seek to Scrap Credit-Ratings Rotation Plan </h2>
<p>European Union lawmakers voted to scrap most of a proposal
to force businesses to rotate the credit-ratings company they
hire to assess their debt, while backing tighter restrictions on
sovereign-debt ratings. </p>
<p>The European Parliament''s economic and monetary affairs
committee voted yesterday in Brussels to scale back the proposed
rotation requirement so that it would apply only to
securitizations and other kinds of so-called structured finance.
The stance brings the Parliament''s position largely into line
with that of EU national governments, which must also approve
the new rules proposed by the bloc''s regulators last year. </p>
<p>The European Commission, the 27-nation EU''s regulatory arm,
proposed the rotation rule last year as part of a draft law to
toughen regulation of the ratings industry amid concerns that
some of its decisions exacerbated the euro-area debt crisis. The
commission said rotation would boost competition and solve
potential conflicts of interest. </p>
<p>Under the commission''s original rotation proposal,
companies would have been obliged to change the company that
they pay to rate their credit every three years. </p>
<p>Parliament and national governments must now begin
discussions on a final compromise bill before the legislation
can become law. </p>

<h2>EU Nations Said to Be Split Over Lending Plan for Failing Banks </h2>
<p>European Union nations are split over plans to force
governments to lend to each other as a last resort to stabilize
crisis-hit banks, according to two people familiar with the
matter. </p>
<p>Germany and Sweden are among nations opposing the move,
part of a broader proposal to take taxpayers off the hook for
bank rescues, said the people, who couldn''t be identified
because the talks are private. The plan, discussed by diplomats
at a meeting in Brussels June 18, received support from other
nations, including Italy and France. The U.K. has previously
said that it was opposed to such funds as they could encourage
lenders to take excessive risks. </p>
<p>Michel Barnier, the EU financial services chief, proposed
setting up a network of national bank-financed funds to shore up
crisis-hit lenders in a draft law this month. He said the
measure was needed to prevent a repeat of the public bailouts
that occurred in the 2008 financial crisis. </p>
<p>Preben Aaman, a spokesman for the Danish presidency of the
EU, and Stefaan De-Rynck, spokesman for Barnier, declined to
immediately comment. The proposals need to be approved by
nations and by lawmakers in the European Parliament before they
can enter into force. </p>
<h2>Compliance Action </h2>
<h2>Universal Gets EU Antitrust Complaint Citing EMI Bid Concerns </h2>
<p>Vivendi SA (VIV)''s Universal Music Group said it received an
antitrust complaint from European Union regulators citing
concerns over its bid for EMI Group''s recorded-music business. </p>
<p>The European Commission has provided us today with a
statement of objections, Adam White, a spokesman for Universal
in London, said in an e-mail yesterday. We will continue to
work closely with the commission and look forward to securing
regulatory clearance. He said Universal is preparing a
detailed response to regulators'' concerns. </p>
<p>A statement of objections sets out regulators'' case for
blocking a deal. Companies may seek an oral hearing and can
offer to sell assets to resolve any concerns. </p>
<p>Regulators have a Sept. 6 deadline to rule on the bid by
Universal, which they have said would create a company almost
twice the size of the next largest player in Europe. </p>
<p>Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for the European Commission
in Brussels, declined to comment on the statement of objections. </p>
<h2>Courts </h2>
<h2>Blue Index Founder Sanders Gets 4 Years for Insider Trading </h2>
<p>The co-owners of the now-defunct spread-betting firm Blue
Index Ltd. and one of their wives were sentenced to a total of
68 months in prison for insider trading. </p>
<p>James Sanders was sentenced to four years in prison while
another owner, James Swallow, was sentenced to 10 months.
Sanders wife, Miranda, also received a 10-month term. </p>
<p>Sanders pleaded guilty to 10 charges, according to the U.K.
Financial Services Authority. He faced as long as six years in
prison if he hadn''t pleaded guilty, Justice Peregrine Simon said
at the hearing in London today. </p>
<p>Sanders''s wife, Miranda, pleaded guilty to five counts of
insider trading, and Swallow to three charges before the trial,
according to the FSA. </p>
<p>A former senior trader at the brokerage, Christopher
Hossain, and another man, Adam Buck, were cleared of similar
charges last month after a five-week trial. </p>
<p>Profits generated by the defendants from the inside
information were about 1.9 million pounds ($2.99 million), while
Blue Index clients reaped about 10.2 million pounds, the FSA has
said. </p>
<h2>Interviews </h2>
<h2>High-Frequency Definition Needed for New Rules, O''Malia Says </h2>
<p>High-frequency trading should be defined before the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission sets rules for what amounts
to about half of the volume of futures markets, said Scott
O''Malia, a member of the panel. </p>
<p>The CFTC needs a better understanding of the practices as
it debates new testing and supervision rules for high-frequency
and automated trading, O''Malia said in a speech prepared for a
Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association conference
yesterday in New York. </p>
<p>The CFTC, with the Securities and Exchange Commission, has
scrutinized such trading since May 6, 2010, when $862 billion
was erased from stock values in 20 minutes in the so-called
flash crash. The agency has been drafting a release on new
rules, a regulatory step prior to proposed rules. </p>

<h2>Comings and Goings </h2>
<h2>RBS to Cut 618 Financial-Planning Jobs, Charge for Advice </h2>
<p>Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, the U.K.''s biggest
taxpayer-controlled lender, is eliminating 618 branch-based
financial advisers as regulators force lenders to charge clients
for the service. </p>
<p>RBS is also creating 351 financial-planning jobs as a
result of the rule changes, the Edinburgh-based bank said in a
statement today. </p>
<p>The Financial Services Authority''s Retail Distribution
Review will from the end of 2012 prevent the payment of
commissions to advisers, and lenders are preparing to charge for
the service. HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) said in June last year it was
cutting 700 employees offering face-to-face advice in branches
while Barclays Plc (BARC), Britain''s second-largest bank, said in
January last year it would cut 1,000 employees as a result of
the regulations. </p>
<p>RBS Chief Executive Officer Stephen Hester has shrunk
assets by more than 700 billion pounds ($1.1 trillion) and cut
about 36,000 jobs since he took over from Fred Goodwin in 2008
at the bank. RBS said in January it would cut about 3,500 jobs
at its investment bank, citing volatile markets and the cost of
new U.K. regulation. </p>
<h2>Indonesia Central Bank''s Hadad to Head Financial Regulator </h2>
<p>Indonesia''s parliament approved Bank Indonesia Deputy
Governor Muliaman Hadad to head the board of a national
financial regulator due to start operating in January. </p>
<p>The central bank may allow banks to own as much as
90 percent of commercial lenders, Hadad said in Jakarta today in
response to a question from reporters. </p>
<p>Approval would be very selective, he said. New
ownership rules will be announced before July, Hadad added. </p>
<p>Lawmakers chose Hadad over Achjar Iljas, who held a similar
position at the central bank a decade ago, after conducting so-
called fit-and-proper tests this month on the 14 people
nominated by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono for the seven
positions at the regulator. Hadad was chosen by acclamation,
rather than by vote, according to a notice posted in the meeting
room of Commission XI, which oversees financial institutions. </p>
<p>The new regulator, known in the Indonesian language as
Otoritas Jasa Keuangan, or OJK, will supervise capital markets,
insurers, pension funds and other non-bank institutions next
year and oversee commercial lenders starting from January 2014. </p>
<p>The OJK will take over regulation of capital markets,
insurers and pension funds from the Capital Market and Financial
Institution Supervisory Board, and assume responsibility for
bank supervision, currently handled by the central bank. </p>

according to a person briefed on the change. </p>
<p>Kennedy, a former general counsel of Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)
who joined the consumer bureau in January 2011, will become an

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) avoided the biggest
potential downgrade by Moody''s Investors Service because of
possible support from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., one
of the ratings company''s analysts said. </p>
<p>There''s a moderate probability that Mitsubishi UFJ,
Japan''s biggest lender and Morgan Stanley''s biggest shareholder,
would support the New York-based investment bank in a crisis,
Bob Young, Moody''s managing director of North American banking,
said in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>Moody''s downgraded 15 banks today after U.S. stock
exchanges closed as part of a review of global banks with
capital-markets operations that was announced in February.
Morgan Stanley, which the firm warned might be cut three levels,
was downgraded by two after lobbying by Chief Executive Officer
James Gorman. Credit Suisse Group AG was lowered three grades. </p>
<p>Management teams will always present as strong a case as
they can, Young said. We undertake a very thorough, very
thoughtful, very deliberate analysis of each individual
institution. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s long-term deposit rating was reduced to A3
from A1 with a stable outlook, and its short-term rating was cut
to P-2 from P-1, Moody''s said in a statement. </p>
<p>Moody''s said when it announced the review that it was
seeking to reflect the banks'' reliance on fragile confidence in
funding markets and increased pressures from regulation and a
difficult market environment. JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s more than
$2 billion trading loss demonstrated the difficulty of managing
risk for banks that depend on trading, Young said. </p>
<p>That exemplified some of the issues, Young said. </p>
<p>Young also said that Moody''s would lower some banks''
ratings were the probability of U.S. government bailouts to
decline. </p>
<p>Mitsubishi UFJ acquired its Morgan Stanley stake when it
invested $9 billion in the company in October 2008, as the New
York-based firm''s stock price tumbled in the wake of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.''s collapse. </p>

<p>The cost to protect against losses
on Morgan Stanley (MS) debt fell after Moody''s Investors Service
downgraded the owner of the world''s largest brokerage two levels
rather than the three that the ratings company previously said
were possible. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps tied to Morgan Stanley dropped 20
basis points after the announcement to a mid-price of 370 basis
points, according to market participants familiar with the
trades. The contracts, which decline as investor confidence
improves, reversed an earlier increase to as high as 400 basis
points, according to prices compiled by data provider CMA. </p>
<p>Bonds issued by Morgan Stanley had already dropped to
prices implying junk ratings, according to a separate Moody''s
unit that analyzes market data. Moody''s had said it might reduce
the rating on the New York-based firm by as many as three levels
in its industrywide review. Morgan Stanley can manage through
any potential cut, Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said
June 12 at an investor conference in New York. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps tied to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
declined 20 basis points to a mid-price of 280 basis points,
market participants said. Moody''s lowered the fifth-biggest U.S.
bank by assets to A3 from A1, with a negative outlook. </p>
<p>Contracts tied to debt of Bank of America Corp. (BAC), lowered
one level to Baa2 with a negative outlook, fell 10 basis points
to a mid-price of 275, the data show. </p>
<h2>Significant Exposure'' </h2>
<p>All of the banks affected by today''s actions have
significant exposure to the volatility and risk of outsized
losses inherent to capital markets activities, Moody''s Global
Banking Managing Director Greg Bauer said in a statement. </p>
<p>Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. </p>
<p>The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, rose 2.9 basis points to a mid-price of 117
basis points 5:34 p.m. in New York, according to Markit Group
Ltd. That''s down from as high as 118 basis points before the
Moody''s announcement. </p>
<p>The downgrades may force banks to post additional
collateral to trading partners in derivatives deals while
boosting the companies'' borrowing costs. Moody''s said when it
announced the review that it was seeking to reflect the banks''
reliance on fragile confidence in funding markets and increased
pressures from regulation and a difficult market environment. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) may be developing
its own Windows Phone handsets, departing from its current
practice of working only with partners like Nokia Oyj, according
to Rick Sherlund, an analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc. </p>
<p>The company may be collaborating with a contract
manufacturer to build a phone, Sherlund wrote in a note today,
citing industry sources. Sherlund, who recommends buying the
shares, said he wasn''t sure if the device would be a reference
design for other companies to use as an example for Windows
Phone products, or a Microsoft-branded phone for consumers. </p>
<p>Microsoft, the largest software maker, said yesterday that
smartphones with the new Windows Phone 8 program will go on sale
in the fall from Nokia, Huawei Technologies Co., HTC Corp. and
Samsung Electronics Co. The company didn''t mention plans for its
own phone. Microsoft needs to boost its share of the phone-
software market, which was 2.2 percent in the first quarter,
according to IDC, lagging behind Apple Inc. and Google Inc. </p>
<p>We would not be surprised if MSFT were to decide to bring
their own handset to market next year given that MSFT has
decided to bring to market their own Windows 8 tablet/PC
products, Sherlund wrote, using Microsoft''s stock ticker. </p>
<p>Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft fell 2.6 percent to
$30.14 at the close in New York. The shares have gained 22
percent in the past year. </p>
<p>We are big believers in our hardware partners and
together we''re focused on bringing Windows Phone 8 to the market
with them this year, said Stacy Drake, a director in the
Windows Phone group, in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<h2>Surface Tablet </h2>
<p>Google''s Android was the smartphone market leader in the
first quarter, with a 59 percent share, and Apple followed with
23 percent, IDC said. </p>
<p>On June 18, Microsoft said it will sell its own branded
tablet computer, called Surface, reversing its long-standing
strategy of relying exclusively on hardware partners in the
computer market. </p>
<p>Microsoft last released a handset, the Kin, in 2010. The
device, targeted at teens and social-media enthusiasts, sold so
poorly that Microsoft ceased work on it after less than two

<p>The Food and Drug Administration cleared the expanded use

diabetic nerve pain and pain after shingles, New York-based
Pfizer, said today in a statement. Pfizer estimates a potential

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Total SA (FP), and
Melrose Resources Plc (MRS) are competing for a permit to explore for
natural gas in the deep waters of the Black Sea (BKSA) off the
Bulgarian coast as the country seeks to boost local output to
one third of consumption. </p>
<p>The winner of the tender will be selected at the end of
July and the contract will be signed in September, allowing the
company to start work by the end of the year, Energy, Economy
and Tourism Minister Delyan Dobrev told reporters in the
Bulgarian capital Sofia today. The exploration permit for the
Khan Asparuh block near the northern border with Romania, is for
five years, including the initial drilling, he said. </p>
<p>We have high hopes to discover significant volumes of
natural gas in the Black Sea, Dobrev said. Preliminary
estimates show there may be natural gas deposits of 40 billion
cubic meters to 80 billion cubic meters, which would cover
Bulgaria''s consumption for the next 15 years to 20 years, he
said. </p>
<p>The Black Sea, which for 40 years divided the Soviet bloc
from U.S. ally Turkey, is now a frontier region, attracting
explorers from as far away as Brazil and Texas. The end of the
Cold War, combined with record-high energy prices and
technological advances, has led oil companies to reconsider its
deep, unexplored waters. </p>
<h2>Imports, Ban </h2>
<p>Bulgaria now imports most of its gas from Russia. It''s
seeking to diversify its supply sources after a price dispute
between Ukraine and Russia caused an interruption in shipments
for two weeks in 2009. OAO Gazprom (GAZP), Russia''s natural-gas export
monopoly, pumps 17.8 billion cubic meters a year to Turkey,
Greece and Macedonia via Bulgaria. About 3.5 billion cubic
meters of that is consumed by Bulgaria. </p>
<p>The cost of locally produced natural gas is 40 percent
cheaper than Russian imports, Dobrev said. Edinburgh-based
Melrose Resources started in 2010 producing gas at three blocks
in Bulgaria''s Black Sea shelf near the Kaliakra cape that
contain an estimated 3 billion cubic meters of gas, which covers
20 percent of the country''s consumption over six years. </p>
<p>Last year Melrose Resources produced 443 million cubic
meters of gas or 15 percent of consumption, he said. </p>
<h2>Direct Petroleum </h2>
<p>Direct Petroleum Exploration Inc., a Denver-based oil
producer, found a natural-gas deposit in Bulgaria estimated at 3
billion cubic meters, near the village of Deventsi close to the
northern city of Pleven, which will also provide about 15
percent of domestic consumption, Dobrev said. </p>
<p>Bulgaria banned hydraulic fracturing and imposed a 100
million-lev ($65 million) fine for offenders, thwarting Chevron
Corp. (CVX)''s plans to explore for natural-gas deposits in the Balkan
country, which limits the country''s options to diversify
sources. </p>
<p>Work on an interconnecting pipeline with the natural-gas
grids of neighboring Romania will start in August, Dobrev said
and the link with Greece''s natural gas grid will be ready in
2015. </p>

<p>Equity markets will probably climb 8
percent a year for the next decade, even though economic concern
will subdue returns in 2012, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s chief
U.S. equity strategist said. </p>
<p>Near term, I think there''s more concern regarding many
asset classes -- equities in particular -- because of the issues
and the headwinds in terms of the economy, in terms of
valuation, in terms of modest earnings growth, David Kostin
said in a Bloomberg Television interview today with Tom Keene
and Sara Eisen. I think those are the issues that you''re
looking at now to the end of 2012. Longer term, statistically,
you should do OK. </p>
<p>Kostin said negative earnings revisions at major companies
and U.S. economic stagnation will hold back stocks this year. </p>
<p>Federal Reserve officials yesterday predicted growth of 1.9
percent to 2.4 percent this year, down from their April forecast
of 2.4 percent to 2.9 percent. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said
the economy remained vulnerable to fiscal tightening and any
worsening of the euro area''s sovereign-debt crisis. The Federal
Open Market Committee, which has kept its benchmark interest
rate near zero since December 2008, reiterated yesterday that it
expects to keep rates exceptionally low at least through
late 2014. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) credit spreads may
narrow after a brief widening once Moody''s Investors Service
announces its downgrades for the largest banks, said Donald Jones, a Sterne Agee  Leach Inc. analyst. </p>
<p>The most likely outcome expected by bond investors is a
three-grade rating cut for New York-based Morgan Stanley, Jones
wrote in a June 19 note. Moody''s is likely to announce ratings
decisions for the largest global banks today, according to two
people with knowledge of the plans who asked not to be named
because the information is private. Moody''s officials in London
declined to comment. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley faces the largest potential downgrade among
U.S. banks as Moody''s reviews ratings of 15 companies with
global capital-markets businesses. Jones, who said in May that a
two-level downgrade was the most likely result, said JPMorgan
Chase  Co.''s $2 billion trading loss and the recent turmoil in
Europe will prompt Moody''s to be more severe in its cuts. </p>
<p>We think there will be short-term pressure on MS spreads
upon Moody''s release, but that will be followed by a steady
rally in spreads, Jones wrote, referring to Morgan Stanley''s
stock ticker. </p>
<p>Mary Claire Delaney, a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman, declined
to comment on Moody''s decision. </p>
<p>Mike Mayo, an equity analyst at CLSA Ltd., wrote in a note
yesterday that the banks'' stock prices already reflect
expectation of the downgrades. The shares of the five U.S. banks
included in the Moody''s review have fallen an average of 9.3
percent since Feb. 15, the day Moody''s announced its review, led
by a 25 percent decline for Morgan Stanley. </p>
<p>The cost to insure five-year senior Morgan Stanley debt has
fallen 18 percent since June 4, dropping to 372.62 basis points
as of yesterday. Still, that''s 15 percent higher than Feb. 15. </p>
<p>The downgrades will probably have little impact on banks''
borrowing costs, Mayo said. The bigger effect may be a reduction
of trading business for lower-rated banks, he wrote. </p>

<p>Celebrities joined advocacy group
Greenpeace International in seeking a ban on oil drilling and
excessive fishing in Arctic waters that would scuttle plans by
Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and its Russian state-run rival OAO Rosneft to
extract petroleum there. </p>
<p>Paul McCartney, boy band One Direction and entrepreneur
Richard Branson are among those named on a scroll calling for
the ban, Amsterdam-based Greenpeace said today during a press
conference at the UN''s Rio+20 Conference on Sustainable
Development. </p>
<p>Exxon, Rosneft and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) are among
companies seeking to drill for oil in the Arctic, which is
estimated to hold 90 billion barrels of oil and 1,670 trillion
cubic feet of natural gas, according to the U.S. Geological
Survey. </p>
<p>It seems madness that we are willing to go to the ends of
the Earth to find the last drops of oil when our best scientific
minds are telling us we need to get off fossil fuels,
McCartney in a statement. We need to take a stand. </p>
<p>Greenpeace intends to collect 1 million names for the
scroll, which will be planted on the seabed four kilometers (2.5
miles) below the ice at the North Pole. </p>
<p>Greenpeace activists occupied a Shell icebreaker in Finland
in May to protest the company''s plans to drill for oil off the
Alaska north coast. The company won U.S. Fish  Wildlife Service
authorization to disrupt animal habitats in the region this
month, moving it closer to starting drilling in the area this
year. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) and other U.S. banks would be subject to Dodd-Frank
Act swaps rules in their overseas offices under guidance that
may be proposed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. </p>
<p>The proposal for so-called interpretive guidance, scheduled
for a vote today at a CFTC meeting in Washington, has been
criticized by U.S. bankers who say it could put them at a
disadvantage to overseas competitors. The international reach of
clearing and trading regulations gained urgency after JPMorgan
disclosed at least $2 billion in losses on trades by the bank''s
chief investment office in London. </p>
<p>I think if we were to leave the London branches of the
U.S. banks or even the guaranteed affiliates out, it would be,
so to speak, another loophole and a retreat from reform, where
risk would come crashing back to our taxpayers and our Federal
Reserve, CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler testified to the House
Financial Services Committee lawmakers during a June 19 hearing
on the JPMorgan loss. </p>
<p>Dodd-Frank, the financial-regulation overhaul enacted in
2010, was intended to reduce risk and increase transparency in
the $648 trillion over-the counter swaps market after largely
unregulated trades helped fuel the 2008 credit crisis. It
required swaps to be guaranteed by central clearinghouses that
stand between buyers and sellers, traded on public exchanges and
reported to swap-data repositories. </p>
<h2>Big Blowouts'' </h2>
<p>As Gensler points out: In all these big blowouts, you
have a global dimension, James Angel, a finance professor at
Georgetown University''s business school in Washington, said in a
phone interview yesterday. You can''t really blame a regulator
faced with this kind of mess wanting to have all the information
readily available. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley (MS) and other U.S.
banks have argued that applying Dodd-Frank to their overseas
operations would hurt their ability to compete with foreign-
based rivals that may face other requirements. </p>
<p>If JPMorgan overseas operates under different rules than
our foreign competitors, we can no longer provide the best
products and services to our U.S. clients or our foreign
clients, JPMorgan''s Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said
at the financial-services panel hearing on the losses. The
rules at the transaction level about margin reporting, all those
requirements may enable Deutsche Bank to make the better deal. </p>
<p>U.S.-based banks may be allowed to comply with the rules on
a timetable that''s similar to one facing their overseas rivals,
two people with knowledge of the guidance said yesterday. </p>
<h2>New Timetable </h2>
<p>The timetable under consideration by the CFTC would drop
earlier plans to give foreign-based banks more time to comply
with some regulations than overseas operations of U.S. banks,
the people said on condition of anonymity because the guidance
hasn''t yet been proposed. </p>
<p>The compliance schedule was the subject of negotiations
yesterday before the agency''s vote today. Steve Adamske, a CFTC
spokesman, didn''t immediately respond to requests for comment
outside of normal business hours. </p>
<p>The guidance, which has been the subject of internal debate
and disagreement at the agency during the last month, would be
open to public comment before it is completed. U.S.
Representatives Scott Garrett, a New Jersey Republican, and
Randy Neugebauer, a Texas Republican, sent Gensler a letter
yesterday urging the CFTC to adopt a form rule that includes an
analysis of the costs and benefits of the regulation instead of
informal guidance. </p>
<p>We respectfully request that you do not move forward with
the non-binding guidance'' and instead proceed through a formal
rule-making process and conduct the appropriate cost-benefit
analysis that the law requires, the lawmakers wrote. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), which was downgraded
two levels to Baa1 yesterday by Moody''s Investors Service,
increased the percentage of the derivatives housed in its
higher-rated bank subsidiary in the first quarter. </p>
<p>The notional amount of derivatives in Morgan Stanley Bank
NA jumped 49 percent to $2.57 trillion, according to a report
released today by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
That brought the share of Morgan Stanley''s total derivatives in
the bank, which has a A3 rating after the cut, to 5.1 percent
from 3.3 percent at the end of 2011. </p>
<p>Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in April that the
firm has been slowly moving derivatives into the bank,
starting with new foreign-exchange contracts and following with
interest-rate deals. The movement came as the firm faced
questions about whether counterparties would halt long-dated
business with Morgan Stanley after it was downgraded. </p>
<p>The bank is still waiting for approval from the Federal
Reserve in order to transfer existing derivative contracts into
the bank subsidiary, according to a person familiar with the
matter, who asked not to be identified because the information
isn''t public. Bank of America Corp., the second-largest U.S.
lender, moved derivatives from its Merrill Lynch unit to its
bank last year after its rating was cut, prompting objections
from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., people familiar with
the matter said at the time. </p>
<p>The increase in derivatives held in Morgan Stanley Bank was
driven by a jump in over-the-counter forwards and options, which
both climbed to more than 10 times the level at the end of last
year, according to the OCC report. </p>
<p>Reuters reported the increase earlier today. </p>

<p>Protalix BioTherapeutics Inc. (PLX) and
Pfizer Inc. (PFE) failed to win European Union backing for a medicine
to treat a rare genetic ailment because a competing treatment
from Shire Plc (SHP) has exclusive market rights for 10 years.
Protalix fell the most in more than six months. </p>
<p>Taliglucerase alfa shouldn''t be allowed on the market
because it works in the same way as Shire''s Vpriv, the European
Medicines Agency''s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human
Use said in a statement today. Medicines for rare diseases,
known as orphan drugs, are expensive to develop and have small
patient populations, so drugmakers are given exclusivity as an
incentive to develop them. </p>
<p>From a commercial standpoint, this is obviously a setback
that we will need to address, Protalix Chief Executive Officer
David Aviezer said on a conference call with analysts. We will
continue to do whatever we can to eventually try to reverse this
refusal. Pfizer''s legal team is looking into different
options, he said. </p>
<p>The decision is a setback for Carmiel, Israel-based
Protalix, which won approval for the product from the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration on May 1 under the name Elelyso. The
treatment, Protalix''s first drug on the market, helped patients
with Gaucher disease in clinical trials, and side effects were
similar to those of other enzyme replacement therapies, the
London-based drug agency said today. </p>
<h2>Missing Enzyme </h2>
<p>Protalix''s U.S. shares fell 6.7 percent to $6.16 at 4 p.m.
in New York. The shares have gained 25 percent this year, giving
the company a market value of $566.1 million. Pfizer rose less
than 1 percent to $22.73. </p>
<p>The drug is a plant-based medicine that replaces an enzyme
missing in people with Gaucher disease, a genetic ailment that
affects as many as one in 50,000 people in the U.S., according
to the National Human Genome Research Institute. Sanofi (SAN) also
sells a drug for Gaucher called Cerezyme. </p>
<p>Gaucher disease can cause fat to build up in the liver,
spleen, bone marrow and nervous system. About 1 in 14
individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry carries the mutated
gene that can cause the illness, and as many as 1 in 500 present
a form of the disorder. </p>
<h2>Positive Assessment'' </h2>
<p>While we are disappointed with the CHMP''s recommendation,
we are encouraged that the committee gave a positive risk-
benefit assessment, Diem Nguyen, Pfizer''s general manager for
biosimilars, said in a statement. The recommendation was based
solely on orphan market exclusivity and not the safety and
efficacy profile of taliglucerase alfa. Pfizer will continue to
work with relevant stakeholders to determine appropriate next
steps. </p>
<p>Pfizer unsuccessfully sought an exemption from the
exclusivity rule based on several factors, the company said.
There was no good evidence that Elelyso was clinically superior
to Vpriv, or that Vpriv was in short supply, both of which are
criteria for exemptions, the agency''s drug-review committee
found. </p>
<h2>Short Supply </h2>
<p>Drugs for Gaucher and another illness, Fabry disease, have
been in short supply in the past couple of years because of a
2009 virus contamination at a Genzyme Corp. plant in Allston,
Massachusetts. Sanofi acquired Genzyme, the maker of Cerezyme,
last year, and has said production levels are increasing.
Protalix thought it could win an exemption for Elelyso because
of the shortages, CEO Aviezer said. </p>
<p>The European Commission usually adopts the committee''s
advice. Shire''s Vpriv was approved in Europe two years ago. </p>
<p>Pfizer, the world''s largest drugmaker, paid $60 million for
rights to sell taliglucerase and agreed to pay Protalix an
additional $55 million if the drug passed certain regulatory
hurdles, according to a December 2009 statement. New York-based
Pfizer is entitled to 60 percent of the drug''s revenue under the
agreement. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) failed to
win the dismissal of a lawsuit brought by shareholders claiming
they were harmed by conflicts of interest related to
collateralized debt obligation transactions. </p>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Goldman
Sachs in April 2010, alleging fraud tied to CDOs that
contributed to the worst financial crisis since the Great
Depression. Goldman Sachs''s shares dropped about 13 percent
after the lawsuit was filed. The firm paid
$550 million to settle with the SEC, the largest penalty in the
regulator''s history. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Paul A. Crotty in Manhattan ruled
yesterday that investors can proceed with a lawsuit alleging
Goldman Sachs''s stock plummeted because the bank failed to
disclose that it had bet against CDOs it sold to customers.
Crotty dismissed arguments that Goldman Sachs made material
misstatements or omissions regarding its receipt of warnings
from the SEC that the company might be sued. </p>
<p>Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment on the ruling. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs created and sold CDOs linked to subprime
mortgages in early 2007, as the U.S. housing market faltered,
without disclosing that hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the
underlying securities and bet against one of the vehicles, known
as Abacus, according to an SEC lawsuit. </p>
<p>Goldman''s allegedly manipulative, deceitful, and
fraudulent conduct in hiding Paulson''s role and investment
position in Abacus transaction, and in hiding its own investment
position in Hudson, Anderson, and Timberwolf I transactions
takes plaintiffs'' claim beyond that of mere mismanagement,
Crotty said in his ruling. </p>
<p>The case is In re Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Securities
Litigation, 10-3461, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) agreed to buy
corporate social-network operator Yammer Inc. for $1.2 billion
in cash to help it woo businesses with Facebook-like tools that
help employees collaborate in the workplace. </p>
<p>San Francisco-based Yammer will become part of Microsoft''s
Office division and the team will continue to report to current
Yammer Chief Executive Officer David Sacks, the companies said
today in a statement. </p>
<p>Yammer provides features -- similar to those found on
Facebook Inc. (FB) -- to more than 200,000 companies such as Ford
Motor Co. and EBay Inc. (EBAY) The purchase will help Microsoft compete
with corporate-social features like Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM)''s
Chatter product, as well as startups such as Jive Software Inc. (JIVE)
and Asana Inc., run by Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz. </p>
<p>They''ve been behind in terms of social, and this puts
them in a really strong position, perhaps even the lead, said
Rob Koplowitz, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc. (FORR) There are
a lot of communications that are being generated by social. </p>
<p>Yammer was founded in 2008 by Sacks, the former chief
operating officer at PayPal Inc., and Adam Pisoni, who currently
serves as chief technology officer. It has raised more than $140
million in funding from venture firms, including Charles River
Ventures Inc. and Emergence Capital Partners. </p>
<h2>Office, SharePoint </h2>
<p>Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, will add Yammer''s
corporate-social networking tools to its Office and SharePoint
software products for businesses. Large information-technology
companies are snapping up nimbler startups, sometimes before
they reach an initial public offering, spending $17.4 billion on
enterprise software acquisitions in 2011, compared with $715.5
million in 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Besides integrating Yammer into existing products,
Microsoft will continue to offer it as a standalone service,
Office Division President Kurt DelBene said on a conference
call. The deal is likely to be completed in the third quarter. </p>
<p>While DelBene couldn''t say when Yammer features would
appear in Microsoft''s Office 365 cloud-based applications or in
SharePoint, he said that the cloud apps get updated quarterly,
or even monthly in some cases. </p>
<p>Yammer works with Apple Inc.''s iPhone and Google Inc.''s
Android and that will continue under Microsoft, the companies
said. The software gives companies a private way to help
employees communicate. For example, supermarket chain Supervalu
Inc. (SVU) uses it to let sales people talk and share ideas. </p>
<p>Sacks will become a vice president in the Office division.
Yammer will keep its San Francisco office and employees, he said
in an interview. </p>
<h2>Sacks Committed'' </h2>
<p>Both I and my co-founder are committed to staying at the
new company and continuing to run Yammer for a long time to
come, Sacks said. </p>
<p>Yammer was advised by Frank Quattrone''s Qatalyst Partners
LLC, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, who
asked not to be identified because the information hasn''t been
made public. Business Insider previously reported Qatalyst''s
involvement. </p>
<p>The Yammer deal follows other recent enterprise-software
purchases centered on social media. Salesforce.com will gain
social-marketing tools through its $745 million agreement to
purchase Buddy Media Inc. earlier this month, and Oracle Corp. (ORCL)
recently announced plans to buy two companies that analyze data
on social-media sites. Those are Vitrue Inc. and Collective
Intellect Inc. </p>
<p>Microsoft shares fell 2.7 percent to $29.87 at the close in
New York. The stock has gained 15 percent this year. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Bristol-Myers Squibb
Co. (BMY) failed to gain approval of their top experimental drug, the
blood thinner Eliquis, from U.S. regulators who said they needed
more data on the treatment. </p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration wants clarification of
information from already completed trials, and isn''t seeking new
studies, the companies said in a statement. The drug, aimed at
patients with heart arrhythmia, would have $2.5 billion a year
in sales by 2015 if approved, according to Tim Anderson, a
Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. analyst in New York. </p>
<p>Eliquis is among experimental products the two New York-
based companies were depending on to replace sales from best-
selling drugs that have lost patent protection in the last year.
An FDA response could take six months after the requested data
is supplied, said Laura Hortas, a Bristol-Myers spokeswoman. </p>
<p>We are already working with the agency, and we are
hopeful that the review of our submission can be completed
within a shorter time frame, Hortas said in an e-mailed
response to questions. The FDA''s response does not alter our
confidence in the therapeutic profile of Eliquis. </p>
<p>Pfizer shares fell 1.1 percent to $22.47 at 4 p.m. New York
time. Bristol-Myers shares dropped 3.5 percent to $34.13. </p>
<h2>Competing Products </h2>
<p>Johnson  Johnson (JNJ), of New Brunswick, New Jersey, and
Leverkusen, Germany-based Bayer AG have a competing pill,
Xarelto, as does Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, of Ingelheim,
Germany. Bayer rose less than 1 percent to 52.97 euros in
Frankfurt. </p>
<p>Both Pfizer''s cholesterol pill Lipitor, with $12.9 billion
in peak yearly sales, and Bristol''s blood-thinner Plavix, with
$7.09 billion in revenue, lost patent protection. </p>
<p>It''s a delay but it shouldn''t impact the longer term
profile of the product, said Marshall Gordon, an investor with
Clearbridge Advisors in New York, in a telephone interview.
It''ll still have a best-in class profile. His fund owns
shares of both companies. </p>
<p>Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst with ISI Group, said the FDA
was likely looking to make sure data in one of the clinical
trials was accurate about how many strokes and bleeding episodes
patients on the drugs had. </p>
<p>Although this is a material time delay, we don''t see an
impact to our conclusion that Eliquis will eventually dominate
the blood thinner space, he said in a note to clients. </p>
<p>The companies had been planning to launch promotion of the
pill after what had been an expected approval this month, Hortas
said. A six month delay would push that launch into 2013. </p>
<p>Eliquis is one of three drugs Pfizer had been expecting to
help replace revenue lost from Lipitor.  The company is awaiting
FDA approval of its arthritis pill tofacitinib, which won the
backing of U.S. regulatory advisers last month. Pfizer plans to
release data on its experimental Alzheimer''s treatment
bapineuzumab at a medical meeting in October. </p>

<p>Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM), the
struggling maker of the BlackBerry smartphone, fell the most
since May after Morgan Stanley (MS) downgraded the stock, citing
rapidly deteriorating fundamentals. </p>
<p>The only way RIM remains a viable entity is at a fraction
of its current size, a transformation that erases much of its
earnings power, Ehud Gelblum, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in
New York, wrote in a note to investors today. He cut RIM''s
recommendation to underweight, a negative rating, from
equalweight, the equivalent of a hold. </p>
<p>RIM''s stock fell 7.6 percent to $9.11 at the close in New
York, the worst decline since May 30. The shares are trading at
their lowest level since December 2003. </p>
<p>The company plans to release a new lineup of phones based
on the BlackBerry 10 operating system, an attempt to reverse a
sales slide and regain market share from Apple Inc.''s (AAPL) iPhone and
devices running Google Inc.''s (GOOG) Android. RIM, which has hired
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and RBC Capital Markets to help evaluate
options, has lost two-thirds of its value in the past 12 months. </p>
<p>The introduction of BlackBerry 10 is likely too late and
fraught with risks, Gelblum said. A shortage of chips may
hamper the release, and the lack of a physical keyboard on new
phones may alienate customers, he said. </p>
<p>RIM unveiled a BlackBerry 10 prototype phone without the
company''s hallmark keyboard last month. Still, RIM has said it
will continue to produce some phones with keyboards. </p>
<h2>Profit Projection </h2>
<p>Gelblum lowered his projection for fiscal 2014 earnings per
share to a loss of $1.39 from a loss of 85 cents, and cut his
revenue forecast for the same period to $7 billion from $9.7
billion. The average of analysts'' estimates compiled by
Bloomberg was profit of 52 cents on revenue of $12.2 billion. </p>
<p>To reach the break-even point again, without boosting
revenue, RIM would have to eliminate 90 percent of its
employees, Gelblum said. </p>
<p>Results in the quarter ending in August may
significantly trail analysts'' estimates because of RIM''s
aging portfolio of devices and a pause of shipments ahead of the
introduction of the BlackBerry 10 operating system this year,
Gelblum said. </p>
<p>Other analysts are similarly pessimistic about RIM''s
fortunes. RIM''s new phones will struggle to compete with the
latest models from Apple and Samsung Electronics Co., Alkesh Shah, an analyst at Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR) in New York, wrote in
a note today. Shah rates RIM the equivalent of a hold. </p>
<p>We expect fundamentals to worsen at RIM for at least the
next two to three years before reaching bottom. </p>

exception: Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK), the second biggest U.S. gas
producer now facing a cash-flow shortage. </p>
<p>For more than a decade, JPMorgan bankers have declined to
do business with Chesapeake and its chief executive officer,
Aubrey McClendon, 52, said people with knowledge of the matter.
In contrast, Goldman Sachs, which once loaned money to McClendon
against his wine collection, recently helped arrange a $4
billion loan for Oklahoma City-based Chesapeake and is advising
on its efforts to sell assets. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. lender by assets, is missing out
on a shot at hundreds of millions of dollars in fees paid to
banks over the years by Chesapeake, one of the energy industry''s
most active dealmakers. Avoiding Chesapeake also limits
JPMorgan''s risk should the gas company''s finances worsen. </p>
<p>It''s unusual to choose not to do any business with an
organization that buys a lot of banking services, said Douglas Elliott, a fellow in economic studies at the Washington-based
Brookings Institution and a former investment banker. If
anything, there''s a tendency to be greedy and want the fees. </p>
<p>Concerns about Chesapeake''s fast growth and credit quality
played a role in JPMorgan''s decision not to pursue business from
the energy firm, said the people, who asked not to be identified
because the discussions were private. Competition is already
fierce and other banks have an edge, reducing the attractiveness
of pursuing Chesapeake work, one person said. </p>
<p>Officials at Chesapeake and New York-based JPMorgan
declined to comment. </p>
<h2>Reckless Billionaire'' </h2>
<p>McClendon is known as one of the energy industry''s biggest
risk-takers. Forbes magazine last year called him America''s
most reckless billionaire. He founded the company in 1989,
going on buying sprees that eventually amounted to a portfolio
of oil and gas fields that covers an area half the size of New
York State. </p>
<p>Along the way, McClendon has outspent cash flow in 19 of 21
years, relying on asset sales or financing transactions to stay
afloat. That has sometimes left the company, with unsecured debt
rated as junk by Standard  Poor''s and Moody''s Investors
Service, exposed to swings in oil and gas prices. Beset by low
oil prices, the company put itself up for sale in 1998, failing
to secure a buyer. </p>
<p>One of the last pieces of investment-banking work that
JPMorgan, then known as J.P. Morgan  Co., did with Chesapeake
was a 1996 stock offering, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<h2>Bear Stearns </h2>
<p>In 2008, McClendon asked JPMorgan to renew the relationship
after the bank bought Bear Stearns Cos. Bear was a frequent
participant in Chesapeake bond and stock offerings, some of
which JPMorgan completed after the purchase, said a person with
knowledge of the deals. </p>
<p>Steven Black, then co-CEO of JPMorgan''s investment bank,
and Douglas Petno, head of JPMorgan''s natural-resources
investment banking group, met with McClendon to discuss the
matter, the people said. The practice remained in place. </p>
<p>Other senior managers involved in the decision included
Kelly Coffey, who ran corporate derivatives marketing and the
North American reputational risk committee; Stephen Eichenberger, a credit-risk executive, and Larry Landry, a
leveraged-finance banker, the people said. All five didn''t
respond to requests for comment. </p>
<h2>Chesapeake''s Growth </h2>
<p>This group of JPMorgan officials and others inside the bank
met repeatedly to discuss Chesapeake''s growth, its credit
quality and the proper value of its holdings. One view of the
executives was that Chesapeake''s assets, including pipelines and
real estate, were strong yet might not provide enough collateral
if the company was forced to sell assets later, the people said. </p>
<p>In one meeting of JPMorgan executives in 2008, it was
decided that Chesapeake didn''t meet at least portions of the
bank''s so-called five P''s of lending: people, payment,
protection, purpose and perspective, the people said. Those five
P''s, which other banks often call the five C''s -- character,
capacity, collateral, capital, conditions -- are used to examine
whether a borrower is creditworthy. </p>
<p>JPMorgan never found evidence of wrongdoing at Chesapeake,
the people said. </p>
<p>The bank''s position is more of an understanding among its
staffers than a formal policy, said people familiar with the
situation. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56, was aware of
the practice while not involved in making the decision, one
person said. The stance on Chesapeake applies across all of
JPMorgan''s units, including lending, credit-derivatives and
merger-and-acquisitions, said people familiar with the matter. </p>
<h2>Avoided Meetings </h2>
<p>Junior bankers in the oil and gas investment-banking group
are told not to seek meetings with Chesapeake executives to
pitch JPMorgan''s services, as they would most other energy firms
of Chesapeake''s size, people familiar with the matter said. </p>
<p>Banks occasionally will reject a potential client, said
Bradley Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. and a
former chief financial officer at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. </p>
<p>It''s tough to do, because the pressure on these banks is
to go out and bring in deals, he said. It''s usually a senior
person making that decision. </p>
<p>Chesapeake is a gusher for investment banks. It issued
additional stock 13 times since its initial public offering in
1993, generating at least $265 million in fees, and it had 14
bond issues outstanding as of Dec. 31. It''s also the most
acquisitive company in the U.S. oil and gas exploration and
production industry, with 35 deals in the past 10 years valued
at $9.2 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg </p>
<h2>Under Pressure </h2>
<p>This year, there will be more business. McClendon is facing
natural gas prices near historic lows, and is under pressure to
sell billions of dollars of assets to meet obligations. The
company''s cash-flow shortfall could reach $22 billion by next
year, according to James Sullivan, an analyst at New York-based
Alembic Global Advisors. </p>
<p>He''s also contending with a governance crisis. Shareholders
including billionaire Carl Icahn replaced a majority of the
board and stripped McClendon of his role as chairman after
Reuters reported in April that he had borrowed against personal
stakes in company wells. </p>
<p>Chesapeake does business with most Wall Street players,
including Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF), its closest adviser, Morgan
Stanley (MS), Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Citigroup Inc. (C) and Credit Suisse
Group AG. (CSGN) </p>
<h2>Goldman''s Work </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs has developed a tight relationship with
Chesapeake, working with the company since at least 2005, when
it helped with a $262 million stock offering. </p>
<p>In addition to the recent loan and the asset-sale talks,
Goldman Sachs also won major roles in the planned initial public
offerings of Chesapeake''s oilfield-services subsidiary and FTS
International, a pressure-pumping business 30 percent owned by
Chesapeake. In 2009, a Goldman Sachs debt fund helped finance a
private-equity firm that bought rights to future oil and gas
production from some Chesapeake wells for $412 million. </p>
<p>Chesapeake is a long-standing Goldman Sachs client and
the company and its board recently turned to us for both advice
and capital, said Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-
based Goldman Sachs. We''re proud Chesapeake chose us and our
involvement is consistent with our focus on helping our clients
with their particular needs. </p>
<p>The Goldman Sachs connection extends to McClendon''s
personal wealth. In 2008, the firm filed a notice that it had
extended credit to McClendon against his wine collection, at one
point considered among the biggest in the U.S. Construction of a
$3 million, 31,000-square-foot warehouse to maintain the
collection was halted around the same time. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs helped McClendon liquidate his personal
holdings in Chesapeake stock later that year when he sold his
stake to meet margin calls, according to a regulatory filing. </p>
<p>Banking in many ways is still a trust business, said
Elliott of the Brookings Institution. Different people form
their opinions in different ways about who crosses the minimum
threshold of trust and who doesn''t. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Co. (KO) said the company and
its local partners plan to spend $5 billion in India by 2020 on
expanding its distribution and adding capacity to meet rising
demand in the world''s second-most populous nation. </p>
<p>The company and its bottling partners will invest $30
billion globally in five years on new plants and sales networks,
Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent said at a press conference
in New Delhi today. </p>
<p>Kent aims to boost sales in a country where 12 of his
products are consumed per person annually, compared with 38 in
China, 40 in Kenya and 92 as global average. The Atlanta-based
company expects India''s large population of teenagers,
increasing urbanization, changing lifestyles and expanding
economy to drive demand for its products. </p>
<p>All of which explains why we believe this business has
near limitless growth potential, said Kent. India is a
wonderfully diverse country. Dynamic, young and emergent. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola targets India to be among its top five countries
by volume from seventh now, according to Kent. </p>
<p>India''s non-alcoholic beverages market is estimated by
Euromonitor International to double to 12.9 billion liters in
2015 from 6.2 billion liters in 2010. </p>
<h2>Market Share </h2>
<p>Coca-Cola''s subsidiary held a 25 percent share of the non-
alcoholic beverages market in India in 2010, ahead of rival
PepsiCo Inc. (PEP)''s 20 percent, according to data from Euromonitor.
Parle Bisleri Ltd., based in Mumbai, also had a 25 percent
market share. </p>
<p>The India investment includes the $2 billion the world''s
largest soft-drink maker and its partners announced in November. </p>
<p>Tata Global Beverages Ltd. (TGBL), which sells Tetley Tea and
Eight O''Clock coffee, said in February it plans to market a
nutrient beverage in India with PepsiCo''s local unit. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola''s India unit sells beverages including Coca-Cola,
Diet Coke, Fanta and Sprite, fruit drinks Minute Maid and Maaza,
and Kinley bottled water through more than 1.5 million outlets. </p>
<p>The company first began selling its products in the country
in 1952, but exited the market in 1977 when government
regulations changed and required the company to have a local
partner. It returned to India in 1993, after the change in rules
allowed a wholly owned subsidiary. </p>
<p>The beverage maker seeks to increase sales in India as part
of its so-called 2020 Vision announced in November 2009,
according to Kent. The plan entails boosting the company''s
annual revenue, including that of its system of global
distributors, to $200 billion by the end of the decade. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)''s decade-long
struggle against a European Union antitrust probe that led to
more than 1.68 billion euros ($2.1 billion) in fines will enter
its final phase tomorrow when an EU court rules on the company''s
challenge. </p>
<p>The world''s largest software company asked the EU General
Court to void an 899 million-euro fine imposed after Microsoft
failed to comply with a 2004 antitrust order to provide rivals
with data to help them work with the company''s operating-system
software. The fine was on top of Microsoft''s earlier penalties
of 497 million euros and 280.5 million euros and surpassed only
by a 1.06 billion-euro levy against Intel Corp. </p>
<p>The two fines for Microsoft and Intel certainly sent a
message, said Ted Henneberry, a lawyer at Bingham McCutchen
LLP in Washington who has previously worked for Microsoft on
matters not related to the EU case. This thing is history now.
Today companies realize that you''re better served trying to work
things out with the European Commission. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s Windows software powered 95 percent of
personal-computers in 2004, when EU regulators fined the company
a record 497 million euros and ordered it to offer a version of
the software without a music and video player. Now, amid a
global slump in PC sales, Microsoft is preparing to manufacture
its first tablet to challenge Apple''s Inc.''s iPad. </p>
<p>Microsoft is the only company in more than 50 years of EU
competition policy penalized for failing to comply with an
order. The Redmond, Washington-based company agreed to a
settlement in 2009 in a bid to repair the company''s relationship
with the European Commission. Microsoft is now on the other side
of the fence, filing complaints against Google Inc. (GOOG) and what is
now its Motorola Mobility unit. </p>
<h2>Other Foot'' </h2>
<p>Brad Smith, Microsoft''s general counsel, last year wrote of
the irony of complaining to EU regulators about Google after
more than a decade wearing the shoe on the other foot with the
European Commission. Microsoft alleged that Google''s pattern
of actions entrenches the search engine operator''s control
over online search and related advertising. </p>
<p>Google, based in Mountain View, California, was told by the
EU last month it could avoid an antitrust complaint over
allegations that it discriminates against rivals if it offered
to settle a probe by early July. </p>
<p>Regarding Microsoft chances of success tomorrow in its
case, Robin Koch, a spokesman for the software maker in
Brussels, and Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for the commission,
declined to comment ahead of the ruling. Microsoft may make one
final appeal of the ruling to the EU''s highest court, the
European Court of Justice. </p>
<h2>License Guidance </h2>
<p>Microsoft argued at a hearing last year that regulators
should have given it more guidance to avoid the fine. Under the
initial decision, Microsoft was ordered to provide data to
competitors to allow servers to connect to computers using the
Windows operating system. It was also required to limit to a
reasonable amount the royalties it charged. </p>
<p>The fine was a so-called periodic penalty calculated
because Microsoft was in breach of the EU order for 488 days,
regulators said in 2008. The EU assessed Microsoft''s proposals
for 306 days of that period, the company told judges at the
hearing. </p>
<p>Microsoft also questioned EU reports prepared by a trustee
responsible for monitoring the company''s compliance with the
2004 decision. Although Microsoft lost a 2007 appeal of the
initial fine, the court ruled regulators were wrong to force the
company to give powers to the independent trustee who had access
to its documents, premises and software source code. </p>
<h2>Bright Line </h2>
<p>The big issue is whether it was reasonable for the
commission to fine an enormous amount of money for non-
compliance with what was not a bright-line issue, said Becket
McGrath, a lawyer at Edwards Wildman Palmer UK LLP in London.
The issue of whether or not there was compliance is a very
technical one and depends on the price Microsoft charged for
the interoperability information and what it had to disclose. </p>
<p>The tribunal might give guidance on whether Microsoft''s
proposed royalty rates for the interoperability information were
excessive, said Thomas Vinje, a lawyer at Clifford Chance LLP
who represented International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and Oracle
Corp. (ORCL), which opposed Microsoft in the case. </p>
<p>Fair and reasonable licensing terms, or FRAND, form the
core of three investigations regulators opened this year into
whether Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) and Google''s Motorola Mobility
used their control of standard technology patents to block
competitors'' devices, the EU''s antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia
said this month. He said there was a need to clarify what are
the implications of FRAND and how FRAND negotiations should be
conducted. </p>
<p>Microsoft filed a complaint with EU regulators earlier this
year, alleging that Motorola Mobility was attempting to block
sales of Windows computers and the Xbox game console by
overcharging for key technology patents. Motorola Mobility,
which Google bought last month, offered to settle the dispute.
Google also complained to the EU that Microsoft and Nokia Oyj
unfairly colluded to use patents to block rivals. </p>
<p>The court could opine on what constitutes fair,
reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing terms in this case,
and some in the antitrust community rightly or wrongly would be
likely to interpret any such decision as a precedent for other
pending FRAND cases, Vinje said. </p>
<p>The case is T-167/08, Microsoft v. European Commission. </p>

<p>Supplying electricity to the
billions of people living in abject poverty is a more
important goal than curbing greenhouse-gas emissions, Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM) Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson said. </p>
<p>Electricity will do more to improve the quality of life for
people who still cook food by burning animal dung than trying to
prevent climate change, which will be manageable, Tillerson
said at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York today. </p>
<p>Environmental groups and scientists are urging reductions
in the use of fossil fuel-fired power plants, the largest man-
made source of greenhouse-gas emissions tied to global warming.
Tillerson said other issues should take precedence. </p>
<p>There are much more pressing priorities that we, as a
human race, need to deal with, he said. The world''s poorest
residents don''t even have access to fossil fuels to burn.
They''d love to burn fossil fuels because their quality of life
would rise immeasurably. </p>
<p>People will adapt to rising sea levels and changing weather
patterns resulting from climate change, he said. </p>
<p>Increasing CO2 emissions in the atmosphere will have a
warming impact, Tillerson said. It''s an engineering problem
and it has an engineering solution. </p>
<p>Farmers may shift crops to new regions as temperatures
rise. As a species, that''s why we''re all still here, he
said. We adapt. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil, under prior CEO Lee Raymond, funded groups
that questioned the impact of global warming. Since Tillerson
took over the company in 2006, he has spoken more openly about
climate change. </p>

<p>General Mills Inc. (GIS), the maker of
Cheerios cereal and Pillsbury baked goods, projected full-year
profit that trailed analysts'' estimates amid increased marketing
and investments in its U.S. yogurt business. </p>
<p>Profit for fiscal 2013, including a decrease from its
acquisition of Yoki Alimentos SA, will total $2.65 a share, the
Minneapolis-based company said today in a statement. Analysts
projected $2.76 a share, the average of 18 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ken Powell has boosted
marketing and raised prices on some products to counter rising
costs for raw ingredients such as wheat and sugar. Increased
pension expenses and a higher tax rate may also reduce annual
earnings growth, the company said. </p>
<p>General Mills fell 1.6 percent to $37.55 at the close in
New York. The shares have dropped 7.1 percent this year. </p>
<p>The company expects 2013 net sales to grow at a mid-
single-digit rate. </p>
<p>Fourth-quarter net income rose 1.6 percent to $325.4
million, or 49 cents a share, from $320.2 million, or 48 cents a
share, a year earlier, General Mills said today. Sales rose 12
percent to $4.07 billion, falling short of the $4.11 billion
average of analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Excluding some items, profit totaled 60 cents a share.
Analysts projected earnings of 59 cents a share, the average of
17 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>International Segment </h2>
<p>Sales in the U.S. retail business rose 2.9 percent to $2.4
billion, driven by the Snacks and Small Planet Foods divisions. </p>
<p>The company has been growing through acquisitions, having
announced or completed four of them in fiscal 2012. The Yoplait
acquisition played a big role in boosting quarterly sales at the
company''s international segment, which grew 46 percent to $1.13
billion. Yoplait sales accounted for all of the company''s
international growth and more than offset price declines. </p>
<p>General Mills announced in May that it agreed to buy
Brazilian foodmaker Yoki for about 1.75 billion reais ($840
million) to boost snack sales in Brazil. The transaction will
close during the first half of fiscal 2013. The deal, which will
give General Mills nine brands and more than 600 items, also
includes the assumption of about 200 million reais of
outstanding debt. </p>

<p>Walter Haefner, the world''s oldest
billionaire, who gained his riches from importing cars to
Switzerland and then becoming the biggest shareholder of U.S.
software-maker CA Inc. (CA), has died. He was 101. </p>
<p>Haefner died on June 19 after a long and fulfilled
life, according to a statement on the website of Amag
Automobil und Motoren AG, the Swiss car dealership he founded. </p>
<p>Haefner was the oldest person with a net worth exceeding $1
billion and the third-richest Swiss, with $4.3 billion,
according to Forbes magazine. His death makes David Rockefeller,
97, the U.S. banker and grandson of Standard Oil founder John D.
Rockefeller, the eldest billionaire, with $2.5 billion. </p>
<p>An entrepreneur, Haefner sold wood-gas-powered cars during
World War II. After shifting his focus to software in the 1970s,
he acquired what became a 24.8 percent stake in Islandia, New
York-based CA, the world''s second-largest maker of mainframe-
computer programs. </p>
<p>He saw the promise in a digital future, Sam Wyly, the
Dallas-based businessman who built a fortune in technology and
retailing, wrote about Haefner in his 2008 book, 1,000 Dollars
and an Idea: Entrepreneur to Billionaire. </p>
<p>Haefner also was a breeder and rider of thoroughbreds. One
of his horses, Go And Go, won the 1990 Belmont Stakes in Elmont,
New York. He owned a share of Secretariat, the 1973 Triple Crown
winner, William Nack wrote in his 1988 book, Secretariat: The
Making of a Champion. </p>
<h2>Scholarship Student </h2>
<p>Walter Haefner was born in Zurich on Sept. 13, 1910. He was
raised with his six siblings by his mother Elise, while his
missionary father August Wilhem spent much of the time in Tibet.
Haefner enrolled in the University of Zurich and the University
of Lyon in France with the aid of a scholarship from the City of
Zurich, according to Bilanz magazine. </p>
<p>Haefner founded Amag in January 1945 on Zurich''s lakefront.
The company grew to become Switzerland''s biggest car dealership
and main importer of Volkswagen, Seat, Skoda and Audi vehicles,
according to its website. </p>
<p>In the early 1960s, Haefner moved Amag''s accounting and
payroll to an International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) system and
then started Automation Center AG, a computer services firm,
Forbes reported in 2000. He got into the U.S. computer services
business in 1976 with the purchase of a majority stake in
Dallas-based Wyly, which later renamed itself Uccel Corp. </p>
<h2>Computer Illiterate </h2>
<p>CA, then known as Computer Associates International Inc.,
bought Uccel in 1987 and Haefner received a chunk of its stock.
His CA holdings, described in a June 10, 2011, proxy statement
on the company''s website, were worth $2.4 billion in August
2011. He never learned basic computer skills, according to
Forbes. </p>
<p>Haefner developed a passion for thoroughbreds after his
first ride on a racehorse in Paris in 1959, Nack wrote in
Secretariat. </p>
<p>I loved it, the sensation of speed on a horse, Haefner
said, according to the book. </p>
<p>In 1962, he won the European cup for amateur riders,
according to Forbes. That same year he bought Moyglare Stud Farm
in Ireland. </p>
<p>Haefner had a daughter, Eva-Maria Bucher, and a son, Martin
Walter Haefner, who became chairman of Amag''s holding company
Careal Holding AG. </p>
<p>The senior Haefner lived with his fourth wife, France, in a
six-bedroom house in Kuesnacht, outside Zurich, that he bought
in 1948, according to Bilanz. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) is taking ServiceNow
Inc. public this week in the first U.S. technology initial
public offering since Facebook Inc. (FB), a sale that may be crucial
in preserving its position as Silicon Valley''s go-to bank. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley has been under fire for how it led the $16
billion Facebook sale after the shares plunged as much as 32
percent since their debut last month. That''s put the New York-
based firm under more pressure than usual to balance
ServiceNow''s expectations with those of investors when it prices
the IPO of the cloud-based software maker on June 28. </p>
<p>Everybody is going to be watching this IPO, and Morgan
Stanley''s reputation is on the line, said Keith Wirtz, who
oversees $15 billion as chief investment officer at Fifth Third
Asset Management in Cincinnati. If the price is too low, the
company is underserved; if the price is too high, like Facebook,
investors will be frustrated. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s dominance in the IPO market is at stake.
The firm is the No. 1 underwriter of global IPOs and is on track
to lead the most initial offerings by Internet and technology
companies this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The outcome of ServiceNow''s IPO is also likely to influence
plans to go public by other technology companies such as Palo
Alto Networks Inc. and Kayak Software Corp. and may help revive
the broader IPO market. </p>
<h2>Lower Multiple </h2>
<p>ServiceNow and its founder are offering the stock for $15
to $17 a share. The company attracted more than enough demand
for all the shares being sold in the offering, a person with
knowledge of the matter said today. The person, who asked not to
be identified as the terms aren''t final, declined to say by how
much the offering is oversubscribed. </p>
<p>The midpoint of the price range would give the San Diego-
based company a valuation of about $1.92 billion, 13 times
ServiceNow''s (NOW) trailing 12-month sales. That''s more than twice the
average valuation sought in the biggest U.S. software-company
IPOs since the start of 2011, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>It''s a lower multiple than Facebook, which was valued at
about 26 times sales in its May 17 IPO, the largest in history
for a technology or Internet company. Morgan Stanley bought
Facebook shares on behalf of the underwriting syndicate on the
first day of trading to keep them from slipping below the $38
offering price, people familiar with the matter said at the
time. The shares traded 13 percent below the IPO price as of
yesterday. </p>
<p>Facebook was a mistake from a pricing standpoint, said
Stanley Nabi, who helps oversee more than $10 billion as vice
chairman of New York-based Silvercrest Asset Management Group.
Overpricing the next deal will taint Morgan Stanley. </p>
<h2>First-Day Pop </h2>
<p>At the same time, underpricing the IPO may upset
ServiceNow''s owners, including JMI Equity, Sequoia Capital and
Greylock Partners. For entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, an
IPO is a chance to partly cash out and to raise as much money as
possible to fund a company''s growth. They normally keep most of
their equity and sell down in later share sales. None of
ServiceNow''s VC backers are selling in the IPO. </p>
<p>Greylock spokesman Tom Frangione declined to comment, as
did Andrew Kovacs, a spokesman at Sequoia. Officials at JMI and
Sequoia didn''t immediately respond to phone messages seeking
comment. </p>
<p>A first-day pop between 15 percent to 25 percent is the
sign of a healthy stock -- above that it means the stock has
been underpriced, said Darren Hayes, the chairman of the
computer information systems program at Pace University in New
York and a former stockbroker. </p>
<h2>More Feedback </h2>
<p>To help abate concern, Morgan Stanley, which was criticized
in the Facebook IPO for failing to listen to input from co-
underwriters, is likely to give more heed to fellow managers
Citigroup Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), according to people
familiar with the matter. Paul Chamberlain, Morgan Stanley''s co-
head of the global technology group, is leading the ServiceNow
IPO, said the people. Michael Grimes, who is co-head with
Chamberlain, led the Facebook IPO. </p>
<p>Pen Pendleton, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley, declined to
comment. Officials at ServiceNow didn''t respond to phone
messages seeking comment. </p>
<p>A successful offering by ServiceNow may help improve
sentiment for IPOs after initial sales globally have raised 50
percent less than a year ago, Bloomberg data show. Palo Alto
Networks, an Internet security company, will base its plans to
go public in July on ServiceNow''s early performance, while Kayak
may set terms on its IPO if the offering goes well, said people
familiar with the companies'' plans. Morgan Stanley is also
leading those sales. </p>
<h2>Rivals'' Performance </h2>
<p>Rivals'' performance suggests ServiceNow might have room to
rise at the midpoint valuation. Cornerstone OnDemand Inc., the
maker of employee-development software, went public at about 14
times trailing 12-month sales in March 2011 and has since gained
67 percent through yesterday. </p>
<p>ServiceNow shares will probably initially pop because
it''s a good growth story in a hot industry, said Francis Gaskins, president of researcher IPodesktop.com in Marina del
Rey, California. </p>
<p>ServiceNow is led by Chief Executive Officer Frank Slootman, who previously ran Data Domain Inc. He sold the
storage company for more than $2 billion in 2009 to EMC Corp.
following a battle with NetApp Inc. that boosted the final
takeover price by 34 percent. </p>
<h2>Slootman''s Record </h2>
<p>The company, which plans to list on the New York Stock
Exchange under the symbol NOW, generated more than $150 million
in revenue in the 12 months through March 31, while total
customers grew 61 percent to 1,074. It posted a net loss of
$10.3 million. </p>
<p>Slootman''s track record may help lure ServiceNow investors,
said Peter Barris, managing general partner at New Enterprise
Associates, a venture capital firm that backed Data Domain.
Morgan Stanley should also be given the benefit of the doubt,
though an unsuccessful debut for ServiceNow may have
consequences. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley has led many of our IPOs and my experience
with them has been fantastic, said Barris. If a ServiceNow
IPO didn''t do well, I would be worried for the longer-term
psychological impact. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) lost a European
Union challenge to an 899 million-euro ($1.1 billion) antitrust
fine, with a court saying it essentially upheld the penalty. </p>
<p>The EU General Court cut the fine by 39 million euros, or
4.3 percent, to 860 million euros in a ruling today. The
Luxembourg-based tribunal rejected all of Microsoft''s arguments
over the fine levied by the European Commission for the
company''s failure to obey an order to share data with rivals. </p>
<p>The fine was on top of Microsoft''s earlier penalties
of 497 million euros and 280.5 million euros in the antitrust
case and surpassed only by a 1.06 billion-euro levy against
Intel Corp. during a period of EU scrutiny of U.S. technology
companies. </p>
<p>The court''s endorsement of the fines is likely to
embolden the commission in pursuing procedural violations,
said Suzanne Rab, a lawyer at King  Spalding LLP, Rab worked on
assignment at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in 2008 on matters
unrelated to its work monitoring Microsoft''s compliance with the
EU order, she said. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s Windows software powered 95 percent of
personal-computers in 2004, when EU regulators fined the company
a record 497 million euros and ordered it to offer a version of
the software without a music and video player. Now, amid a
global slump in PC sales, Microsoft is preparing to manufacture
its first tablet to challenge Apple Inc.''s iPad. </p>
<h2>Fines Paid </h2>
<p>Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, said while it was
disappointed, it paid the fine several years ago. The world''s
largest software company can challenge today''s decision at the
EU''s highest court, the European Court of Justice. Microsoft
didn''t appeal a court ruling it lost in 2007 that sought to
overturn the 2004 order, unaware that judges were split 7-6. </p>
<p>Today''s ruling backed the EU''s so-called periodic penalty
calculated because Microsoft was in breach of the EU order for
488 days, regulators said in 2008. The court cut the fine to
take into account a letter from the commission in 2005 that
accepted limits on Microsoft''s supply of information to open-
source software developers. </p>
<p>Joaquin Almunia, the EU''s antitrust chief, said the
judgment fully vindicates the enforcement action that the
commission took to ensure Microsoft''s compliance with its
obligations, paving the way for a range of innovative
products that would otherwise not have seen the light of day. </p>
<p>Microsoft is the only company in more than 50 years of EU
competition policy penalized for failing to comply with an
order. The company reached a settlement in 2009, which allowed
today''s appeal, in a bid to repair the company''s relationship
with the European Commission. </p>
<p>Microsoft is now on the other side of the fence, filing
complaints against Google Inc. (GOOG) and what is now its Motorola
Mobility unit. </p>
<p>The case is T-167/08, Microsoft v. European Commission. </p>

<p>The U.S. government may need to
develop rules to keep pace with rising use of mobile-payment
systems, a Consumer Financial Protection bureau official told
lawmakers in a statement prepared for a hearing tomorrow. </p>
<p>To the extent that technology companies begin to play
roles traditionally performed by banking institutions, we may
need to reconsider how well our existing regulations apply to a
changed environment, Marla Blow, the bureau''s assistant
director for card and payment markets, said in a written
statement for a House Financial Services subcommittee. </p>
<p>The panel is holding the hearing to weigh how the goverment
should regulate mobile payments, transactions conducted via
smartphones or other portable devices. Blow said the bureau will
be flexible and responsive to the changing marketplace,
which she described as beneficial to consumers. </p>
<p>Innovation can be greatly advantageous to consumers,
offering new tools for people to better control their own
finances and plan their own lives, Blow said. The
connectivity and computing power of a modern smartphone could be
used to develop rich applications that provide better services
at lower costs. </p>
<p>Blow said risks to consumers could stem from the very
nature of mobile payments, which aren''t yet widespread in the
U.S. For example, small mobile device screens complicate
disclosure of terms and conditions, which are in any case
frequently bypassed with a single click, she said. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) plans an expansive
Xbox music service joining Spotify-style streaming with download
and online-storage functions similar to Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s iTunes,
several people with knowledge of the situation said. </p>
<p>The Redmond, Washington-based software maker is in talks
with major record companies for the needed rights, and plans to
begin service later this year, said the people, who asked not to
be identified because the discussions aren''t complete. </p>
<p>By combining the best features of competing services,
Microsoft seeks to build a digital product that lets customers
consume music any way they like. The maker of the Xbox console
is building the new music business after its unsuccessful effort
with the Zune service, which will close and move customers to
Xbox Music, the company said on its website. </p>
<p>Microsoft is negotiating with Vivendi SA (VIV)''s Universal Music
Group, billionaire Len Blavatnik''s Warner Music Group, Sony
Corp. (6758)''s music division, all based in New York, and Citigroup''s
London-based EMI, the people said. </p>
<p>All four music companies declined to comment in e-mails.
Jose Pinero, a Microsoft spokesman, also wouldn''t comment. </p>
<p>Microsoft fell 2 percent to $29.57 at 12:15 p.m. in New
York. The stock had risen 16 percent so far this year. On June
18, the company announced plans to produce its own line of
tablet computers called Surface. </p>
<h2>Streaming Service </h2>
<p>Xbox Music seeks to offer streaming for a monthly or annual
fee, similar to Spotify Ltd.''s subscription service, and let
consumers buy digital music through an online store, such as
Zune, Apple''s iTunes and Amazon.com Inc., the people said. </p>
<p>The company is also seeking to offer Xbox Music users an
online locker accessible by multiple mobile devices running
Windows 8, the people said. Users could put entire collections
online, including music purchased elsewhere, for a monthly or
annual fee, they said. </p>
<p>The talks for the Xbox service are still early and
Microsoft may not be able to obtain all of the rights it''s
seeking, the people said. Even if successful, Microsoft may
choose to roll out features over time, they said. </p>
<p>The Xbox music service was announced June 4 at the E3
video-game conference in Los Angeles, without details about how
it will work or when it will be available. </p>
<p>Microsoft announced the service without having record deals
completed. The company needs the four music companies onboard to
avoid releasing an offering with fewer artists than the Zune
service, the people said. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, named former Financial Accounting Standards
Board Chairman Robert Herz to its board of directors, bringing
it to 14 members. </p>
<p>Herz, who led FASB from 2002 to 2010, will join the board
on July 2 and serve on the audit committee, New York-based
Morgan Stanley said today in a statement. He has served on the
board of Fannie Mae (FNMA) since June 2011. </p>
<p>Herz, 59, was head of FASB through the aftermath of the
financial crisis and the turmoil that followed the collapse of
Enron Corp. and WorldCom Inc., which focused public and investor
attention on accounting scandals. Morgan Stanley Chief Executive
Officer James Gorman earlier this month praised the strength of
his firm''s audit and risk board committees after JPMorgan Chase
 Co. (JPM) faced criticism about the makeup of its board following
disclosure of a $2 billion trading loss. </p>
<p>Herz is a recognized authority on financial reporting,
and we look forward to the insights he will bring that
complement our board, Laura D. Tyson, chairwoman of the
board''s nominating and governance committee, said in the
statement. </p>
<p>Herz presided over FASB as it pushed for accounting rules
that would force banks to mark assets to market value and
require companies to count stock options as a business expense.
He previously served as a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
from 1985 to 2002. </p>
<h2>Committee Members </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley also announced in a filing today changes to
its board committees that will take effect on July 2. James Owens, the former CEO of Caterpillar Inc. (CAT), will be chairman of
the nominating and governance committee and a member of the risk
committee. Tyson is also joining the risk committee, bringing
that group to five directors. </p>
<p>O. Griffith Sexton, a Columbia Business School professor,
is becoming a member of the operations and technology committee,
while Klaus Kleinfeld, the Alcoa Inc. (AA) CEO who joined the board
this year, was added to the nominating and governance committee. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will hold
its third internal bond-trading session today after helping its
clients buy and sell $150 million of debt on the system in the
last week, according to a person familiar with the initiative. </p>
<p>The fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets plans to hold two
electronic-trading rounds, one for investment-grade debt and one
for high-yield, each day that it operates the new system, called
GSessions, said the person, who asked not to be named because
the details are private. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is starting GSessions as banks reduce the
amount of corporate bonds they hold, responding to regulations
requiring they increase capital as a buffer against losses. The
Volcker Rule, seeking to prohibit federally insured banks from
making bets with their own money, may also hinder lenders''
ability to commit money to buy securities from clients,
according to analysts including Sanford C. Bernstein  Co.''s
Brad Hintz. </p>
<p>Debt of Newmont Mining Corp., ATT Inc., Goldman Sachs and
Ally Financial Inc. traded in the sessions on June 21 and 26,
with 39 of the New York-based bank''s clients participating in
the five-minute sessions, the person said. </p>
<h2>Bid-Ask Spread </h2>
<p>The bank charges less for the electronic trades than for
transactions handled over the phone, the person said. The
difference to buy and sell the bonds, known as the bid-ask
spread, is posted before the trading begins and doesn''t change.
Goldman will step in to take one side of a trade if there is
interest from a buyer but no seller or vice versa. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) fell more than
6 percent in New York trading after the New York Times reported
the lender''s losses from credit derivatives may eventually
total as much as $9 billion, exceeding the firm''s initial
estimate. </p>
<p>JPMorgan dropped to $35.77 as of 8:44 a.m. from the $36.78
close in New York yesterday, and reached $34.50 earlier today. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said on May 10 the bank
lost more than $2 billion on bets in credit markets taken by its
chief investment office in London and that the loss could
increase by as much as $1 billion this quarter. Dimon, 56, has
said JPMorgan doesn''t want to do anything stupid by
unwinding the trades too quickly, and he hopes that by the end
of the year the holdings will no longer have a significant
impact on results. </p>
<p>The firm''s losses have increased in recent weeks as
JPMorgan sought to exit its holdings, the New York Times
reported, citing unidentified former traders and executives at
the bank. The company has already closed out more than half of
its positions, the newspaper said. </p>
<p>We are now in the realms of speculation in terms of the
sheer scale, said Christopher Wheeler, a London-based analyst
at Mediobanca SpA, who has a neutral recommendation on JPMorgan
shares. The final loss will be offset by a number of items
including a debt-valuation adjustment gain and gains on the sale
of some of their Treasury securities. However, the larger the
number, the more difficult it is to reduce the impact. </p>
<h2>Sorkin Estimates </h2>
<p>Andrew Ross Sorkin, editor of the New York Times DealBook
and a host of CNBC''s Squawk Box program, said on CNBC today that
the losses would be in the range of $4 billion to $6 billion,
citing sources he didn''t identify. </p>
<p>Dimon told lawmakers this month the company would be
solidly profitable when it reports second-quarter earnings
on July 13. Although the trading loss had grown to $2 billion
for the quarter when the bank disclosed it in May, the net loss
for the CIO division at that time was $800 million. Dimon said
JPMorgan had $8 billion in gains in another trading portfolio
within the CIO and had used $1 billion of that to offset the
loss on the credit derivatives portfolio in London. </p>
<p>The New York Times said JPMorgan may be able to get out of
the money-losing holdings by the end of this year, faster than
previous estimates. That would mean the company could earn $22
billion in 2013, more money than any other bank in the
world, Richard Bove, an analyst at Rochdale Securities LLC in
Lutz, Florida, said today in an interview with Tom Keene on
Bloomberg Radio and Television''s Bloomberg Surveillance. </p>

<p>The U.S. Copyright Office says that
a sequence of yoga poses can''t be copyrighted. </p>
<p>In a release published in the Federal Register on June 22,
the Copyright Office found that a selection, coordination, or
arrangement of exercise movements, such as a compilation of yoga
poses, may be precluded from registration as a functional system
or process. </p>
<p>The policy statement acknowledged that the question of
whether a sequence of preexisting exercises, such as yoga
poses can be copyrighted has occupied the attention of the
Copyright Office for some time. </p>
<p>The policy statement refers to the eight categories of
works that the federal copyright law specifically names for
protection, including pantomimes and choreographic works.
Because exercise is not a category of authorship, the
Copyright Office said in its statement, a compilation of
exercises can''t be copyrighted. </p>
<p>The question has dogged many in the yoga community. Last
year, Bikram Choudhury, the eponymous owner of Bikram''s Yoga
College of India, brought several suits attempting to enjoin
former instructors from teaching yoga that incorporated elements
that he used, including a hot studio and the sequence of poses. </p>
<p>In the litigation, the defendants submitted an e-mail from
Laura Lee Fischer, who was at the time the acting chief of the
office''s Performing Arts Division, stating that yoga sequences
couldn''t be copyrighted. </p>
<p>The new policy statement was a result of that e-mail. </p>
<p>David Carson, the general counsel of the Copyright Office,
said in a telephone interview that the issue is one that we
had been mulling over for quite some time. Once the e-mail from
the office surfaced in the litigation -- and it was at best an
incomplete statement -- we felt like we needed to set the record
straight. </p>
<p>Carson added that the Copyright Office wasn''t seeking
comment on the statement because it isn''t a proposed regulation.
The statement clarifies our practice. </p>
<p>The lawyers representing Yoga to the People have filed the
Copyright Office statement with the court. Jordan Susman, one of
the attorneys representing the defendants, said only that the
Copyright Office statement speaks for itself and otherwise
declined to comment. </p>
<p>Choudhury''s lawyer, Robert Gilchrest, a partner at
Silverman Sclar Shin  Byrne PLLC in Los Angeles, didn''t return
a call seeking comment. </p>

<h2>Microsoft Challenge to EU''s 899 Million-Euro Fine Rejected </h2>
<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) lost a European Union challenge to an 899
million-euro ($1.1 billion) antitrust fine, with a court saying
it essentially upheld the penalty. </p>
<p>The EU General Court cut the fine by 39 million euros, or
4.3 percent, to 860 million euros in a ruling yesterday. The
Luxembourg-based tribunal rejected all of Microsoft''s arguments
over the fine levied by the European Commission for the
company''s failure to obey an order to share data with rivals. </p>
<p>The fine was on top of Microsoft''s earlier penalties of 497
million euros and 280.5 million euros in the antitrust case and
surpassed only by a 1.06 billion-euro levy against Intel Corp.
during a period of EU scrutiny of U.S. technology companies. </p>
<p>The court''s endorsement of the fines is likely to
embolden the commission in pursuing procedural violations,
said Suzanne Rab, a partner in the London office of King 
Spalding LLP. </p>
<p>Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, said while it was
disappointed, it paid the fine several years ago. The world''s
largest software company can challenge yesterday''s decision at
the EU''s highest court, the European Court of Justice. </p>
<p>Yesterday''s ruling backed the EU''s so-called periodic
penalty calculated because Microsoft was in breach of the EU
order for 488 days, regulators said in 2008. The court cut the
fine to take into account a letter from the commission in 2005
that accepted limits on Microsoft''s supply of information to
open-source software developers. </p>
<p>Microsoft is the only company in more than 50 years of EU
competition policy penalized for failing to comply with an
order. The company reached a settlement in 2009, which allowed
yesterday''s appeal, in a bid to repair the company''s
relationship with the European Commission. </p>

<h2>Oracle Wins U.K. Supreme Court Ruling Over Marketing in EU </h2>
<p>Oracle Corp. (ORCL), the world''s largest database maker, won a
U.K. Supreme Court ruling protecting its right to be first to
market its hardware in the European Union before third-party
resellers may do so. </p>
<p>The judgment yesterday in London reversed a Court of Appeal
ruling in favor of M-Tech Data Ltd., which was sued by Sun
Microsystems Inc. in 2009 for importing Sun disk drives into the
EU after Sun sold them in China, Chile and the U.S. Sun,
purchased in 2010 by Oracle, may be first to market its goods in
the EU under an economically controversial, but legally well-
established policy, even if it had previously sold the
products elsewhere, the Supreme Court ruled. </p>
<p>M-Tech, based in Manchester, argued that Sun tried to
control the secondary market for its hardware in the European
Economic Area valued at $1.07 billion in 2007, according to the
judgment. M-Tech claimed Sun did so by withholding data from
independent resellers that would have helped determine whether
certain goods had already been sold in the region, producing a
chilling effect, M-Tech said. </p>
<p>The unlawful conduct alleged by M-Tech does not amount to
a defense, even if proved, according to a court summary of the
judgment handed down by a panel of five justices. On the
agreed facts, the disk drives were never marketed in the EEA
until they were imported by M-Tech without Sun''s consent. </p>
<p>M-Tech is surprised and disappointed with the decision,
Harvey Stringfellow, the company''s lawyer at Hill Dickinson LLP
in Liverpool, said in a phone interview. This was a case that
generated a huge amount of interest within the independent
sector for information technology, he said. </p>
<p>M-Tech had argued that Sun can''t enforce its trademark
because Sun is trying to divide the market in the 27-nation EU
in violation of laws permitting free movement of goods. The case
was filed as a trademark dispute because Sun has distribution
rights to products that carry its logo. </p>
<p>Oracle, based in Redwood City, California, acquired Sun in
January 2010, for $7.3 billion, and renamed the unit Oracle
America Inc. </p>

<h2>House Democrats Say Pacific-Region Trade Talks Need Transparency </h2>
<p>A majority of U.S. House Democrats said talks on a Pacific-
region trade agreement the Obama administration is negotiating
with eight other nations haven''t been sufficiently open to
public and congressional scrutiny. </p>
<p>We are troubled that important policy decisions are being
made without full input from Congress, lawmakers led by
Representatives Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut and George Miller of
California said in a letter yesterday to U.S. Trade
Representative Ron Kirk. </p>
<p>The complaint, lodged by 132 of the 191 House Democrats,
reiterates comments by senators including Ron Wyden of Oregon
who have sought more transparency in discussions for the Trans-
Pacific Partnership. </p>
<p>Negotiations resume next week in San Diego to create an
agreement among the U.S., Australia, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia,
New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. The accord would cover
issues including small-business access to global markets,
agriculture, intellectual-property rights and protections for
companies that compete against state-owned enterprises. </p>
<p>Carol Guthrie, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade
Representative''s office, said in an e-mail that she hadn''t yet
seen the letter and didn''t have an immediate comment. </p>
<p>The partnership is one of Obama''s top trade priorities, and
administration officials have said they are working
expeditiously to conclude the talks. </p>

<h2>Netflix Wants Help From U.S. as Cable''s Caps Threaten Growth </h2>
<p>Netflix Inc., (NFLX) the provider of video by mail and over
Internet connections, asked U.S. lawmakers to prevent cable
providers from squelching its growth by imposing online-data
consumption limits for customers. </p>
<p>Netflix, with 23.4 million subscribers, made its request at
a hearing yesterday before the House communications and
technology subcommittee in Washington. </p>
<p>When you couple limited broadband competition with a
strong desire to protect a legacy video distribution business,
you have both the means and motivation to engage in
anticompetitive behavior, David Hyman, Netflix''s general
counsel, testified. </p>
<p>The session was called to examine changes since the last
broad revision to cable law in 1992, when few consumers used the
Internet and cable companies controlled 98 percent of the pay-
television market, according to a staff memo. The 1992 law set
terms for broadcasters to demand payment from cable companies
for their signals. </p>
<p>Since then, the U.S. television market has been reordered
by the emergence of satellite providers Dish Network Corp. (DISH) and
DirecTV (DTV) as competitors to cable, and an array of online video
providers including Netflix and Google Inc.''s YouTube. </p>
<p>Netflix could face higher prices and lowered growth from
limits on data consumption by providers of high-speed Internet
service, or broadband, the Los Gatos, California-based company
said in a filing. </p>

<p>Mark Schwartz, re-hired by Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) this month to run its business in Asia, owns
about $91 million of stock in the bank, according to a filing. </p>
<p>Schwartz, 57, holds 949,028 shares directly and 4,000
shares through trusts established for his family, according to
the filing with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Goldman
Sachs closed at $95.86 in New York, where the firm is based. </p>
<p>Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment on Schwartz''s stake. </p>
<p>Schwartz, now based in Beijing, worked at Goldman Sachs
from 1979 until his departure in 2001. He became chairman of the
Asia business and a member of the bank''s management committee in
1999, the same year that Goldman Sachs went public. </p>
<p>In his new role, he fills a position previously held by J. Michael Evans, who is now based in New York as vice chairman and
global head of growth markets. Schwartz was also named vice
chairman. </p>
<p>Evans owned 1,541,341 shares of Goldman Sachs as of March
26, according to the company''s proxy filing earlier this year.
Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein owned 3,152,524
shares and President Gary D. Cohn owned 1,831,566 shares,
according to the proxy. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s decision to
let Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew retire four days after the
bank disclosed a $2 billion loss in her division allowed her to
walk away with about $21.5 million in stock and options. </p>
<p>Drew, who resigned May 14, can keep $17.1 million in
unvested restricted shares and about $4.4 million in options
that she otherwise would have been required to forfeit if the
New York-based bank had terminated her employment with
cause, according to regulatory filings and estimates from
consulting firm Meridian Compensation Partners LLC. </p>
<p>A 30-year JPMorgan veteran, Drew also had accumulated
661,000 unrestricted shares of common stock worth about $23.7
million based on the May 14 closing price, $9.7 million in
deferred compensation and $2.6 million in pension pay as of Dec.
31, according to company filings. Altogether, Drew''s stock,
pension and deferred pay come to about $57.5 million. </p>
<p>She was with that company for a long time, said Frank Glassner, a partner at Meridian in San Francisco. She was an
incredibly talented, well-thought-of employee, not only within
the company but on the Street. A lot of this money had been
earned over a great deal of time, not just yesterday. </p>

<p>In the hands of England''s
government-run health system, Hinchingbrooke Hospital was called
a basket case in Parliament. Ali Parsa wants to show that
private enterprise can do a better job than the state in
providing medical care. </p>
<p>Parsa, an ex-Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker, wants to
change how U.K. hospitals are run, right down to the meals
served to patients. He''s chief executive officer of Circle
Holdings Plc (CIRC), which in February became the first for-profit firm
to take over a National Health Service hospital when it began
managing Hinchingbrooke in Huntingdon, England. Circle last
month raised 46 million pounds ($72.3 million) in part to help
the company pursue contracts to manage more NHS sites. </p>
<p>People told us you can never run a hospital a different
way; you can never change the way NHS staff work, Parsa, 47,
says in an interview at the company''s London headquarters. We
have fundamentally changed them. </p>
<p>As the U.S. debates what role government should have in
health care, the U.K. is slowly putting some pieces of its 64-
year-old state-run health system into private hands to try to
improve patient care and reduce costs. Prime Minister David
Cameron says more choice and competition are needed to improve
the NHS. Instilling a profit motive in a government-owned
hospital means patient needs won''t come first, said Allyson
Pollock, a researcher at Queen Mary, University of London who
opposes privatization. </p>
<p>It''s immoral, it''s obscene, she said in an interview.
It''s a system that''s going to be built on greed, not need.
It''s the antithesis of everything that we worked for for 64
years. </p>
<h2>Emergency-Room Waits </h2>
<p>From a medical point of view, Parsa appears to be doing
something right. Emergency-room waits at Hinchingbrooke, 70
miles north of London, have improved from the county''s worst to
its best and lengths of stay for people getting non-urgent
orthopedic care have dropped 38 percent, freeing up beds. The
company says serious incidents, such as medication errors or
patient falls, fell by 80 percent in May. Circle also will save
1.5 million pounds on purchasing this year. </p>
<p>Circle''s bid for the 10-year contract to run Hinchingbrooke
beat 18 others. The company gets the first 2 million pounds of
profit from any surplus, and a percentage above that amount,
which the union that represents hospital workers has said will
benefit the company and its shareholders at patients'' expense.
Circle must also fund the first 5 million pounds of any loss, a
risk at a hospital that already has 40 million pounds of debt. </p>
<h2>Patient Perks </h2>
<p>Circle isn''t new to the NHS. Its two-year-old private
hospital near Bath serves as many NHS patients as private
patients -- at NHS prices. Circle has run the U.K.''s largest
treatment center in Nottingham since 2008. The company plans to
open another private hospital in Reading in August or September
and has sites for more clinics. </p>
<p>Parsa says it''s possible not only to provide quality care
and a pleasant patient experience for rich and poor patients
alike, but to make money in the process. At the core of the
business strategy is increased efficiency, primarily through
shorter hospital stays. Patient perks, like inexpensive parking
and food prepared by a chef from a Michelin-starred eatery,
ensure that hospital beds stay full with more rapid turnover. </p>
<p>In Bath, Circle hired a hotel manager and chef from nearby
Lucknam Park Hotel  Spa, a five-star country house hotel.
People from the local village of Peasedown celebrate their
birthdays in the hospital cafe, says Shelagh Meldrum, the
hospital manager. No wonder: A recent lunch served to patients
consisted of scallops and crab salad over dill and cucumber,
followed by a gently grilled salmon main course and lemon posset
for dessert. </p>
<h2>Stock Performance </h2>
<p>Taxi driver Dave McGlennon had a cyst removed from a finger
last year at the hospital. A high point: the food. I had a ham
and cheese omelette with potato wedges after surgery,
McGlennon says. It was to die for. </p>
<p>Financially, Circle has yet to succeed. The company had
revenue of 75 million pounds last year and has lost money every
year since it was founded in 2004. Circle''s stock has plunged 51
percent to 75 pence since its June 2011 initial public offering,
giving the company a market value of 98 million pounds. </p>
<p>The publicly traded company owns 50.1 percent of a
partnership that operates the hospitals and clinics. Parsa and
institutional investors Lansdowne Partners, BlackRock Inc. (BLK), Odey
Asset Management and Invesco Perpetual are among the
shareholders. Employees, including doctors, own the other 49.9
percent. </p>
<h2>Taxpayer Funded </h2>
<p>Circle''s approach to running a hospital is a radical
departure for the NHS. The government created the agency in
1948, bringing hospitals, doctors and other health-care
providers into one taxpayer-funded medical system for all. The
network now includes 257 general acute-care hospitals like
Hinchingbrooke. About 1.7 million people work for the NHS, which
provides free care for the U.K.''s 62 million residents. </p>
<p>A network of three NHS hospitals in South London is holding
talks with the Department of Health about being put under the
control of administrators because it has racked up more debt
than it can pay. The department said June 25 that more than 60
other hospitals may be financially unsustainable and require
restructuring. </p>
<p>The NHS budget at its inception was 437 million pounds, or
9 billion pounds at today''s value, according to the department.
In the current fiscal year, the system will spend 106 billion
pounds. The government has approved an NHS overhaul with a goal
of saving 15 billion to 20 billion pounds on the annual budget
in the four years to 2014-15. </p>
<h2>Partial Strike </h2>
<p>The overhaul prompted the British Medical Association,
which represents two-thirds of practicing doctors, to declare a
partial strike for June 21, its first work stoppage since 1975. </p>
<p>I think the public looks at the U.S. health system and
doesn''t want to see big encroachment of the private sector in
the British health system, said Diane Abbott, a member of
Parliament who speaks for the opposition Labour Party on health
matters. </p>
<p>Defending the Circle deal for Hinchingbrooke in Parliament
last year, the Department of Health''s undersecretary of state,
Frederick Curzon, said: This is a hospital that in common
parlance could be described as a financial and clinical basket
case. </p>
<p>Circle''s bells-and-whistles approach may be a hit with
patients like McGlennon. Skeptics say the company won''t be
judged on its cuisine as much as on the quality of its care. </p>
<h2>Clinical Results'' </h2>
<p>I don''t personally go to a hospital based on Michelin-
starred food; I go to a hospital for clinical results, says
Andrew Hine, a partner at consulting firm KPMG in London and a
former NHS hospital executive. </p>
<p>At Circle''s Nottingham facility, Parsa says patients are
eight times less likely to have to return to the operating room
within four weeks. In 2010-11, the facility had no resistant
Staphylococcus aureus or health-care acquired Clostridium
difficile cases. On the financial side, Parsa said the center
has made an 18 percent annual compound productivity gain. </p>
<p>He says other U.K. hospitals can benefit from Circle''s
approach. If we can deliver what we deliver at NHS prices, why
can''t everybody else? </p>
