&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) loaned
Portugal&#8217;s Banco Espirito Santo SA $835 million in July, just
weeks before the group&#8217;s units sought creditor protection in a
cascade of insolvencies that resulted in the lender&#8217;s bailout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs made the loan through Oak Finance Luxembourg
SA, an investment company that raised funds destined for a
Venezuelan oil refinery project, according to the unit&#8217;s offer
document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banco Espirito Santo, once Portugal&#8217;s biggest publicly
traded lender by market value, was bailed out Aug. 3 after it
disclosed potential losses on loans to other Grupo Espirito
Santo companies and regulators ordered the lender to raise more
capital. The bank was split in two with deposits and healthy
assets becoming Novo Banco in a bailout by the central bank&#8217;s
Resolution Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported earlier today that Goldman 
Sachs sold some of Oak Finance&#8217;s securities at a loss to hedge 
funds and the New York-based firm is still holding some of the 
debt, citing a person it didn&#8217;t identify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An official for Goldman Sachs in London declined to
comment. Novo Banco does not comment about operations that
involve clients, said a spokeswoman, who asked not to be named
in line with company policy. Officials for Portugal&#8217;s central
bank didn&#8217;t have an immediate comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs had agreed to the funding on May 16, the
offer document shows. Four days later, Banco Espirito Santo
warned investors buying stock in its rights offer of
irregularities in the accounts of a parent company and that the
&#8220;serious financial situation&#8221; of the parent firm could be
damaging to the bank&#8217;s reputation. Regulators are examining how
the group&#8217;s companies helped fund each other. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traders are snapping up bullish options on AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), convinced the prospect of a takeover is still on the table even as U.S. lawmakers threaten to crack down on tax inversions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), which withdrew a $116 billion proposal to buy the London drugmaker after merger talks collapsed in May, was allowed to renew the process as of last week, according to U.K. takeover rules. The cost of bullish options on AstraZeneca&#8217;s (AZN) U.S. shares reached its highest level ever compared with bearish ones, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Traders are speculating the plan still has life even as some U.S. lawmakers seek to limit takeovers allowing firms to circumvent tax bills. The bullish options show willingness to bet Pfizer will take another shot, said SunTrust Robinson Humphrey&#8217;s John Boris in New York. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The time period has expired so it&#8217;s logical that people would be speculating,&#8221; said Boris in an interview. &#8220;Pfizer is staring at some pretty challenging times going forward, and as a result they have no alternative but to make an acquisition, and AstraZeneca is one of the acquisitions most speculated.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pfizer has little to show for its research and development, and its business in the U.S., its biggest market, is shrinking. Since 2000, Pfizer has brought just three drugs to market that generate more than $1 billion in annual sales, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Pfizer&#8217;s U.S. revenue was $20.3 billion in 2013, down from $21.3 billion in 2012 and $26.9 billion in 2011, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     Sept. 2 (Bloomberg Businessweek) -- Chevron has finalized
the sale of its renewable-energy subsidiary, Chevron Energy
Solutions, to OpTerra Energy Services, a Chevron spokesman
confirmed today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale, on Aug. 29, marks the latest in a series of moves
away from renewables by the oil company. Earlier this year,
Chevron sold a 48-person division that builds renewable projects
and energy-savings retrofits for federal agencies such as the
U.S. Department of Defense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpTerra is backed by Oaktree Capital Management, a private
equity firm in Los Angeles, according to OpTerra&#8217;s website. It
develops energy-savings projects, as well as clean-energy systems
from technologies like solar and fuel cells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg Businessweek first reported the expected sale of
Chevron&#8217;s clean-energy subsidiary in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron declined to comment on the price of the transaction
or the number of its employees moving to OpTerra. The company
said in a statement that the sale &#8220;is part of an internal
strategic focus on supporting Chevron&#8217;s Upstream and Downstream
businesses. Chevron continues to believe that energy efficiency
and renewable energy are an important part of the overall energy
mix, and operates a portfolio of renewables, including wind,
geothermal and solar.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Oaktree Capital declined to comment. An
OpTerra representative previously declined to comment about the
transaction and didn&#8217;t respond to a new request for comment
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Energy Solutions was first acquired by the oil
company in 2000 and has long been a centerpiece of Chevron&#8217;s
efforts to pursue renewable energy. A decade after acquiring the
division, Chevron boasted that the group had developed hundreds
of renewable and energy-efficiency projects that were &#8220;reducing
greenhouse gas emissions by more than 3 million metric tons.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, Chevron executives frequently touted the
division&#8217;s clean-energy work in speeches and in testimony (PDF)
before Congress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, though, Chevron confirmed that it had suspended
two solar projects at a refinery in Hawaii, which would have
spanned about 20 acres and reduced carbon dioxide emissions by
about 5,000 tons apiece. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And earlier this year, the company dismantled a renewable
power group whose mission was to launch large, profitable
clean-energy projects, Bloomberg Businessweek reported in May.
The group had almost doubled its internal profit targets in 2013,
while helping to launch solar and geothermal projects capable of
powering tens of thousands of homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has pledged billions of dollars to improve compliance and cybersecurity. That&#8217;s not stopping regulators from treating the bank as if it were riskier than ever. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s operational risk-weighted assets, a measure devised by regulators that determines how much capital the bank needs to hold against potential losses from human error, external threats, fraud and litigation, rose 6.7 percent in the second quarter to $400 billion, according to an August filing. Regulators can point to $23 billion of legal settlements last year and a cyber-attack discovered last month as they push JPMorgan to boost its buffer against unforeseen losses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wall Street firms including Citigroup Inc. (C) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) that together racked up more than $100 billion in post-financial crisis legal costs are facing similar pressures. At JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, that means more than $35 billion that can&#8217;t be used for dividends or buybacks, prompting Dimon to call it &#8220;stranded capital.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Banks are saying, &#8216;We&#8217;ve made huge investments in technology and compliance personnel and we aren&#8217;t getting credit for it,&#8217;&#8221; said Justin Fuller, a senior director at Fitch Ratings in Chicago. &#8220;At the same time, the only verifiable data points are these huge litigation costs they&#8217;ve just had, and it&#8217;s hard to ignore those.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and Societe
Generale SA (GLE) are among lenders seen driving a 10 percent gain
among European banks by year-end as investor concerns over their
capital levels and legal bills ease, JPMorgan Chase  Co.
analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European bank shares, tracked by the benchmark Stoxx 600
Banks Index, will reverse their underperformance relative to the
broader market in recent months, the analysts including Kian Abouhossein wrote in an e-mailed report yesterday. The banks
index, down 3.2 percent in the six months through Sept. 1, today
rose 0.7 percent to 198.06 as of 11:15 a.m. in Frankfurt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Central Bank is leading an unprecedented
regulatory scrutiny of the financial health of the region&#8217;s
biggest lenders as it prepares to assume their supervision, an
effort to restore confidence in the industry. European banks
have also faced investor concerns that fines and settlements
would erode capital after France&#8217;s BNP Paribas SA (BNP) paid a record
$8.97 billion penalty for breaking U.S. sanctions in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;ECB stress test should be a positive event,&#8221; the
analysts wrote in the report. All 34 European banks JPMorgan
tested passed its own assessment, which used the same 5.5
percent minimum capital ratio the ECB will employ in the more
adverse of two stress test scenarios, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ECB is scheduled to release the results of its tests
and examination of the balance sheets of 128 euro area lenders
next month. Firms will have six months to raise equity to cover
any shortfalls identified in its balance sheet review or the
milder stress-test scenarios, and nine months to address
deficiencies resulting from the more-adverse scenario. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan added Deutsche Bank, Germany&#8217;s biggest bank,
Societe Generale of France and Amsterdam-based ING Groep NV (INGA) to
its list of &#8220;top picks,&#8221; according to the report. The analysts
removed Caixabank SA (CABK) after the Barcelona-based lender rallied 21
percent this year, the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) trader Deeb Salem struck out in his pursuit of almost $5 million in bonus money on top of $8.25 million he received in 2010 as a Manhattan judge upheld an arbitration panel&#8217;s decision favoring the bank. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;State Supreme Court Justice Eileen Bransten today rejected Salem&#8217;s request to set aside the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority panel&#8217;s decision to dismiss his claim and granted Goldman Sachs&#8217;s request to seal portions of the dispute with the former trader. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Salem claimed he helped the bank earn more than $7 billion and told the arbitration panel on Feb. 25 that he was one of the most sought-after investment professionals in the mortgage industry. The panel, described by Salem&#8217;s lawyer as a &#8220;kangaroo court,&#8221; didn&#8217;t let Salem call some of Goldman Sachs&#8217; top trading executives as witnesses, resulting in a miscarriage of justice, according to the petition. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related: &#8216;Flash Boys&#8217; Programmer Loses in Goldman Fight Over Fees&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What you have failed to do in your application before this court is show any evidence whatsoever that the material that was excluded was pertinent to this case,&#8221; Bransten told Salem&#8217;s lawyer Jonathan Sack. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In transcripts of the hearing, filed by Sack along with the petition and later sealed, Salem said his $8.25 million bonus in 2010 didn&#8217;t reflect his contributions and that he was led to believe he would be paid at least $13 million. The trader argued his bonus was unfairly docked because of a written warning he received about his 2007 self-evaluation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Upside Down &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sack argued in court today that the arbitration panel refused to hear testimony from all of the witnesses he wanted to use in his client&#8217;s effort to show that he had been promised additional compensation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Essentially what this panel did is they turned the process on its head,&#8221; he told Bransten. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bransten said Salem was unable to meet an &#8220;extremely heavy burden&#8221; to set aside the order. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The judge also criticized Sack for including arbitration transcripts with his petition despite knowing that the proceedings were confidential. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;You cannot tell me you&#8217;re not aware of what is usually done,&#8221; she said. Much of the information in the transcript is &#8220;nobody&#8217;s business but Goldman Sachs&#8217;s,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Appeal Planned &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sack said in an e-mail after the hearing that he planned to appeal, without specifying which part of the judge&#8217;s decision he was addressing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tiffany Galvin, a spokeswoman for New York-based Goldman Sachs, said in an e-mail that the bank was &#8220;pleased that the arbitration panel&#8217;s decision was upheld.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In June, Galvin, called the claims over the compensation &#8220;utterly ridiculous&#8221; and &#8220;unworthy of any further response.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Salem initially sought more than $20 million in unpaid compensation in the arbitration and later amended that to a total of more than $16 million, including the bonus money and almost $7 million in deferred stock that he said he was led to believe he would get. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In January 2011, Salem told his mother, who was staying with him because her house had burned down on Christmas, that he expected at least $13 million for 2010, according to the transcript. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The average managing director in the areas of mortgage-backed securities, structured credit and proprietary trading received a 2009 bonus of $750,000 to $1.1 million, according to an Options Group report at the time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said in a court filing in August that the panel gave Salem &#8220;a full opportunity to present his evidence, obviated the needless burden of further witnesses, and followed the law in rendering an award denying the claim.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is not unfair to dismiss a meritless claim,&#8221; the bank said in the filing. Additional witnesses &#8220;would make absolutely no difference whatsoever to the outcome.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, after rising almost 1.3 percent, closed down 0.1 percent at $179.60. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The case is Salem v. Goldman Sachs  Co., 651811-2014, New York State Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Christie Smythe in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan at &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;csmythe1@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael Hytha at mhytha@bloomberg.net Joe Schneider, Charles Carter &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A federal appeals court tossed out a ruling that would have forced Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) to pay the legal fees of a former computer programmer charged with stealing the bank&#8217;s trade secrets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sergey Aleynikov is accused of taking the high-speed trading code on his last day of work at Goldman Sachs. He&#8217;s fighting charges in state court in New York after his federal conviction was overturned. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aleynikov, whose case was the inspiration for Michael Lewis&#8217;s bestseller &#8220;Flash Boys,&#8221; sued in September 2012 in New Jersey seeking more than $2.4 million from Goldman Sachs to cover his legal fees. Goldman Sachs appealed a judge&#8217;s ruling in Aleynikov&#8217;s favor. The appeal raised the issue of whether Aleynikov was an officer at the company, which would have required the bank under its bylaws to cover his legal costs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related: Ex-Goldman Trader Loses in Bid for $5 Million More in Bonus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s unclear whether the term officer would include Aleynikov, who held the title of vice president at one of Goldman&#8217;s units but had no supervisory or leadership responsibilities, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Philadelphia said today in a split ruling. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The bylaws are ambiguous and genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment,&#8221; the court ruled. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter who wins in one U.S. House
district in Washington state in November, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) can&#8217;t
lose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democrat Suzan DelBene, the first-term incumbent in the
seat that includes Microsoft&#8217;s headquarters, is a former
executive in the company&#8217;s mobile-phone division. Pedro Celis,
the Republican challenger, worked there as a distinguished
engineer, a title used for top technical talent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their campaigns echo each other, touting their Microsoft
experience to say they&#8217;d be the best fit for the tech-heavy 1st
District north of Seattle, while raking in tens of thousands of
dollars in donations from current and former workers for the
world&#8217;s largest computer software maker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A campaign between company alumni &#8220;would seem to be a
pretty good deal for Microsoft,&#8221; said Travis Ridout, a
professor at Washington State University who studies campaigns
and elections. &#8220;I can&#8217;t see how that&#8217;s a bad thing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s unusual, too. While many companies have friends in
high places, few members of Congress represent their former
employer&#8217;s headquarters. That will be key for Microsoft as
Congress debates limits on using technology for spying, patent
legislation, tax-law changes and whether to expand immigration
visas for high-tech workers -- all issues Microsoft has lobbied
on during the last two years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Central Bank will buy
as much as 40 billion euros ($53 billion) of asset-backed
securities as part of a program to stimulate the region&#8217;s
economy, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank will limit purchases to the new-issue
market over a three-year period and focus on securities with the
highest credit ratings, JPMorgan analysts led by Gareth Davies
wrote in a note. About 47 billion euros of asset-backed debt has
been sold in the region this year, according to data from the
New York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ECB is preparing to buy ABS as it strives to revive
lending to small-and medium-sized businesses that employ about
70 percent of the European Union&#8217;s private-sector workers. While
the region&#8217;s outstanding ABS market is as large as 1.2 trillion
euros, a purchase program of this magnitude would necessitate it
being expanded beyond SME-backed loans, the analysts said in the
note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The purchase plan is important for a number of reasons,
but broadly because it puts downward pressure on the cost of
issuing ABS, and ultimately feeds into lower product margins on
real economy lending,&#8221; Davies said by e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Frankfurt-based ECB has hired BlackRock Inc. (BLK) to provide
advice as it thrashes out the final design of its plan,
including how much, which assets, and what ranking of bonds it
will buy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon has pledged billions of dollars to improve
compliance and cybersecurity. That&#8217;s not stopping regulators
from treating the bank as if it were riskier than ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s operational risk-weighted assets, a measure
devised by regulators that determines how much capital the bank
needs to hold against potential losses from human error,
external threats, fraud and litigation, rose 6.7 percent in the
second quarter to $400 billion, according to an August filing.
Regulators can point to $23 billion of legal settlements last
year and a cyber-attack discovered last month as they push
JPMorgan to boost its buffer against unforeseen losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street firms including Citigroup Inc. and Bank of
America Corp. that together racked up more than $100 billion in
post-financial crisis legal costs are facing similar pressures.
At JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, that means more than $35
billion that can&#8217;t be used for dividends or buybacks, prompting
Dimon to call it &#8220;stranded capital.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will spend an additional $2 billion from 2012
through this year on improving controls, with an annual $250
million on cybersecurity, Dimon said in April in his annual
shareholder letter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hedge Fund Seeks Evidence from Citigroup Over Argentina Threats &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. judge overseeing a fight between Argentina and its
defaulted bondholders set a hearing for Sept. 10 on a hedge
fund&#8217;s subpoena for evidence that Citibank was threatened by the
South American nation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citibank&#8217;s parent, Citigroup Inc. (C), argued it might lose its
Argentine branch and face &#8220;grave sanctions&#8221; at the hands of
the Argentine government if a U.S. appeals court doesn&#8217;t allow
it to distribute money to Argentina&#8217;s restructured bondholders,
a move barred by U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa in Manhattan,
unless defaulted debtholders are also paid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hedge fund NML Capital, a defaulted debtholder
controlled by billionaire Paul Singer, wants to compel the bank
to provide evidence of claims that Argentina threatened it with
punitive measures if it continues to comply with Griesa&#8217;s order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NML said Citibank has presented no evidence of Argentina&#8217;s
threats other than a letter to the appeals court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a spokeswoman for Citigroup,
didn&#8217;t immediately return a call seeking comment on the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is NML Capital Ltd. v. Republic of Argentina, 08-cv-06978, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York

&lt;h2&gt;Ex-Republican Leader Cantor Gets Job at U.S. Investment Bank &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor has taken a job at
the investment bank Moelis  Co. (MC) that will pay him at least $3.4
million, according to the company&#8217;s filings with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cantor, 51, quit Congress effective Aug. 18 after losing
the Republican June primary in his congressional district near
Richmond, Virginia, to a Tea Party-backed newcomer, David Brat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In seven terms in Congress, Cantor became a chief critic of
President Barack Obama, fighting such White House priorities as
the 2009 economic stimulus package and the 2010 health-care
overhaul. Moelis said that in his new role, Cantor, who fought
to lower taxes and unburden businesses from excessive
regulation, will provide strategic counsel to corporate and
institutional clients on key issues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hackers who stole gigabytes of data from JPMorgan Chase  Co. may have been trying to send a message that U.S. financial institutions can be disrupted, the former director of the National Security Agency said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The FBI is investigating the cyberattack on JPMorgan and whether other banks were penetrated in retaliation for U.S.- backed sanctions on Russia, according to people familiar with the investigation who asked not to be identified because the probe is still underway. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Graphic: Data Breaches in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keith Alexander, the NSA director from 2005 until last March, said he had no direct knowledge of the attack though it could have been backed by the Russian government in response to sanctions imposed by the U.S. and EU over the crisis in Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Securing the Net&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;How would you shake the United States back? Attack a bank in cyberspace,&#8221; said Alexander, a retired U.S. Army general who has started his own cybersecurity company to sell services to U.S. banks. &#8220;If it was them, they just sent a real message: &#8216;You&#8217;re vulnerable.&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As NSA chief and head of the U.S. Cyber Command, Alexander tracked and tried to thwart international hackers, giving him knowledge of their tactics. He was head of the NSA in 2008 when the country of Georgia was invaded by Russia and experienced a series of disruptive cyberattacks believed to be the work of Russian hackers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Apple's event on Tuesday sucks all the air out of tech coverage (and it's already getting difficult to breathe), several of the company's smartphone rivals this week did their best not to be forgotten amid the increasing iHoopla.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the announcements, which were made at IFA, the big consumer electronics show in Berlin:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Samsung&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samsung Electronics, Apple's biggest competitor, unveiled the Note Edge, a smartphone with a display that curves down one side so users can read messages, news and stock tickers from an angle. If that feature is well-received by consumers, one analyst said Samsung could apply that screen technology to its new Galaxy phone next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samsung also showed off the Note 4, which comes with a higher-definition screen, microphones that allow for cleaner recordings, and a feature that celebrities may want to be careful with: the ability to snap group selfies with a 120-degree view. The Note 4 goes on sale next month, while the Note Edge will be available later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Note line, with its larger screens, will be under pressure next week when Apple is expected to push into the "phablet" category. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The South Korean company also displayed a virtual-reality headset, developed with Facebook's Oculus unit, as well as a new 2-inch Gear S wristwatch with a curved display and built-in network connectivity for calls and text messages. Apple&#8217;s wearable device, often referred to as the iWatch, may not come out until next year, according to a report from Recode. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getty Images Inc. sued Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT) over claims its Bing Image Widget, an application that
allows Web designers to add collages and slideshows, violates
Getty&#8217;s copyrights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getty, the Carlyle Group LP-controlled photo archive, said
in a complaint filed in Manhattan federal court today that the
Bing tool displays images without permission from copyright
owners including, in many instances, Getty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than draw from a licensed collection of images,
Microsoft &#8220;gathers these images by crawling as much of the
Internet as it can, copying and indexing every image it finds,
without regard to the copyright status of the images and without
permission from copyright owners,&#8221; according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit, which says Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft
released the Bing Image Widget service in August, seeks a court
order blocking the company from its collection of images and
unspecified damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Wooton, a Microsoft spokesman, didn&#8217;t immediately
return an e-mail seeking comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Getty Images Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 14-cv-7114, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is planning
its first foray into Islamic capital markets three years after
starting a sukuk program that it never used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five banks including the New York-based lender will manage
the dollar-denominated offering via JANY Sukuk Co., four people
with knowledge of the deal said. A benchmark-sized sale may
follow, they said, asking not to be identified as the plan is
private. Goldman Sachs in 2011 created a $2 billion program that
faced criticism from some Islamic advisers for not ensuring debt
would be traded at par value, as required by Shariah. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is joining a growing number of issuers
seeking to tap demand among Muslim investors in an industry that
Ernst  Young LLP forecasts will double in the five years
through 2018 to $3.4 trillion. The U.K. became the first non-Muslim country to issue Islamic bonds in June with a sale that
lured bids for more than 10 times the amount offered. Luxembourg
and Hong Kong are also planning investor meetings for similar
offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s so much pent up demand in the sukuk space,&#8221;
Thomas Christie, the Dubai-based head of fixed income at
Prometheus Capital Finance Ltd., said by phone. &#8220;Given the
controversy in the past, it would be interesting to see what
structure they&#8217;re going to use, how they&#8217;re going to use the
funds and how the Islamic community reacts to it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Previous Attempt &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planned security will take the form of Sukuk al Wakala,
a Shariah-compliant structure in which one party entrusts
another to act on its behalf. Standard  Poor&#8217;s rated the issue
A-, the seventh-highest investment grade, the company said in an
e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lender established a sukuk program three years ago
based on a so-called commodity murabaha structure, or a cost
plus mark-up transaction, that was approved for listing on the
Irish Stock Exchange by the Central Bank of Ireland. Murabaha
certificates can only be bought and sold at par value because
they represent a future claim on the underlying assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program, blessed by eight of the world&#8217;s top Islamic
scholars, became entangled in a debate on whether it met
Shariah-compliant guidelines and over lack of clarity on how
Goldman Sachs planned to use the funds it raised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pent-Up Demand &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will hold investor meetings in the Middle
East on Sept. 10 and 11 and a so-called Regulation S
transaction, which exempts overseas offerings from registration
requirements under the SEC Securities Act of 1933, may follow,
the people said. A benchmark-sized sale usually raises at least
$500 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notes would &#8220;probably price tighter&#8221; than Goldman
Sachs&#8217; conventional bonds due to the &#8220;pent-up demand in the
sukuk space,&#8221; Christie of Prometheus said. The average yield on
debt that complies with Muslim tenets dropped 63 basis points
this year to 2.78 percent yesterday, the lowest since May,
according to the Deutsche Bank Sukuk Bond Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic lenders will have 70 million customers by 2018, up
from 38 million last year, according to Ernst  Young forecasts.
Shariah-compliant banking assets will double in that period,
according to the advisory company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;South Africa, Bangladesh &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Africa last month picked banks for its debut sale of
Islamic notes, while Bangladesh and the Russian region of
Tatarstan are planning inaugural sales. In addition to itself,
Goldman Sachs hired Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank PJSC, National Bank
of Abu Dhabi PJSC, Emirates NBD Capital Ltd. and NCB Capital to
manage the offering, the people said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand for Islamic bonds is surging helped by ample
liquidity at banks. Al Hilal Bank PJSC, an Islamic lender owned
by the Abu Dhabi government, received about $5 billion in bids
for its $500 million sale of perpetual sukuk in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Clearly, this is a good time and the demand for sukuk is
still there,&#8221; Apostolos Bantis, credit analyst at Commerzbank
AG in Dubai, said by phone. &#8220;This does actually indicate that
the asset class of sukuk is expanding and diversifying.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JANY Sukuk will enter a murabaha agreement for 49 percent
of the issued amount and a wakala agreement for the remaining 51
percent with J. Aron  Co., a Goldman Sachs subsidiary,
according to SP. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A win for Scottish nationalists seeking a breakaway from the U.K. may have &#8220;severe&#8221; consequences in the short term and spark a pound selloff, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economist Kevin Daly. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The uncertainty about whether Scotland will leave the sterling monetary union could create&#8221; a crisis similar to the one that almost splintered the euro area, Daly said today in an interview with Anna Edwards on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;On The Move&#8221; program in London. &#8220;In the long run, there&#8217;s no reason to believe why Scotland couldn&#8217;t prosper as an independent country. Our concerns are predominantly about the short-to-medium term, but those concerns are pretty severe.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As Scotland enters the final days of campaigning before the Sept. 18 plebiscite, the currency market is taking notice after a YouGov Plc poll for the Sept. 2 editions of the Times and Sun newspapers showed the pro-U.K. camp leading by six percentage points once undecided voters are stripped out, from being 14 points ahead in the last YouGov poll conducted on Aug. 12-15. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scotland&#8217;s Bid for Independence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After initially dismissing the referendum, investors &#8220;realize that this is going to be disruptive in an economic sense if the Yes camp win,&#8221; John Normand, head of foreign-exchange and international-rates strategy at JPMorgan Chase  Co., told Edwards and Mark Barton on the &#8220;Countdown&#8221; program. &#8220;People realize increasingly that the undecided camp is big enough to swing this&#8221; and that is why &#8220;volatility is picking up,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Volatility Surge &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Implied one-month volatility in sterling against the dollar surged 23 percent after the survey was released, the most since 2008. Sterling has declined since then and today fell 0.2 percent to $1.6432 today, having reached $1.6440 yesterday, the weakest since Feb. 12. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The question of whether a go-it-alone Scotland will be able to keep the pound in partnership with the remaining parts of the U.K. has dominated the independence debate with all the major parties in Westminster saying they would oppose it. Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond has argued they would change their view once negotiations began after a Yes vote and has said Scotland would refuse to pay its share of the U.K. national debt if they didn&#8217;t give in. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The aftermath of a vote for separation &#8220;will be absolutely chaotic,&#8221; Andy Brough, executive director at Schroder Investment Management in London, said on Bloomberg Television. &#8220;Companies will have to sit down and rational thinking will have to be made.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Lukanyo Mnyanda in Edinburgh at lmnyanda@bloomberg.net; Lucy Meakin in London at lmeakin1@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editors responsible for this story: Paul Dobson at pdobson2@bloomberg.net; Rodney Jefferson at r.jefferson@bloomberg.net Mark McCord, Todd White &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) announced the Lumia
830, its first high-end smartphone since it bought Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)&#8217;s
devices unit for about 5.4 billion euros ($7.2 billion) in
April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The device has a 5-inch display and a 10-megapixel camera,
will cost about 330 euros before taxes and subsidies and starts
shipping this month, the software giant said today at the annual
IFA consumer electronics show in Berlin. Microsoft also showed
the Lumia 730 and Lumia 735, which will cost 199 euros and 219
euros, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re bringing those flagship experiences to a more
affordable price segment,&#8221; Chris Weber, head of mobile devices
sales at Microsoft, said at the conference. &#8220;Apple can&#8217;t say
that and Samsung can&#8217;t say that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella is
struggling to boost the market share of Windows Phone, which was
2.5 percent in the second quarter. Consumers are opting for
devices made by Apple Inc. or powered by Google Inc.&#8217;s Android
software, which together represent 96 percent of smartphones,
according to data from IDC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft in July announced the biggest job cuts in its
history, planning to slash 18,000 positions as the company
integrates Nokia&#8217;s handset unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares have jumped 13 percent since the purchase
was completed on April 25, giving the Redmond, Washington-based
company a market value of $370 billion. Microsoft shares traded
at the equivalent of $45.03 at 1:27 p.m. in Frankfurt, compared
with the $44.96 close in New York yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung Electronics Co. yesterday unveiled two new
smartphones and showed off a virtual-reality headset, developed
with Facebook Inc.&#8217;s Oculus unit, and a new smartwatch. Apple is

&lt;p&gt;Solvay SA (SOLB) agreed to buy a
performance polymers business from Chevron Phillips Chemical Co.
for $220 million to expand its offering of lightweight plastics
for replacing heavier metal parts in cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchase of Ryton polyphenylene sulphide plants will
also increase Solvay&#8217;s exposure to the electronic-materials
industry, where polymers are used to enhance the fire-resistance
of components, Brussels-based Solvay said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Belgian chemical maker said it&#8217;s looking to exploit the
full potential of Chevron Phillips technology as car
manufacturers increasingly use lightweight components to boost
fuel efficiency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ryton PPS fits neatly with our unique specialty polymers
portfolio and reinforces our unrivalled capabilities to provide
solutions to our customers in dynamic innovative end-markets,&#8221;
Augusto Di Donfrancesco, president of Solvay Specialty Polymers,
said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solvay will gain Ryton PPS sites in Texas and Oklahoma, and
a plant in Belgium. Solvay plans to invest in a PPS production
technology developed by Chevron Phillips that hasn&#8217;t &#8220;achieved
its full potential,&#8221; the company said. Completion of the deal
is expected in the fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s own investigators have found clues that a global network of computers available for hire by sophisticated criminals was used to reroute data stolen from the bank to a major Russian city, according to people familiar with the probe. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like street magicians using sleight of hand, the hackers tapped computers from Latin America to Asia to send commands and obscure their identity while ferrying malicious traffic past one of the most heavily guarded networks on Wall Street. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Graphic: Data Breaches in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank investigators working nearly around the clock have identified what they believe to be the assault&#8217;s staging ground, called a &#8220;bulletproof&#8221; hosting platform because of its resilience to other attackers and to law enforcement, according to one of the people, who requested anonymity because of the continuing investigation.

&lt;p&gt;Thirty prominent companies and 32
states urged the U.S. Supreme Court to rule on gay marriage,
adding to calls from both sides as the justices prepare in the
coming weeks to say whether they will intervene. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies include Deutsche Bank AG (DB), eBay Inc., Pfizer
Inc. (PFE), Target Corp. (TGT) and Viacom Inc. (VIA) In court papers filed this
week, they said inconsistent state marriage laws posed a human-resources problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The different laws force companies to &#8220;affirm
discrimination we regard as injurious to our corporate missions
and contrary to non-discrimination laws and policies,&#8221; the
group said in court papers. The businesses includes Bloomberg
LP, the parent of Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appeals in gay-marriage cases from Utah, Virginia and
Oklahoma are likely to be before the justices when they meet
Sept. 29 for a private conference in advance of the nine-month
term that starts the following week. Under its practices from
previous years, the court could act as quickly as Sept. 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The states weighing in are almost evenly divided in their
laws. Colorado is leading a group of 17 states that ban gay
marriage. That group said a Supreme Court ruling would &#8220;stave
off the increasing burden of same-sex marriage litigation
against the states.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second group of 15, led by Massachusetts, directly urged
the high court to declare same-sex marriage a constitutional
right. &#8220;Denying same-sex couples access to marriage creates
second-class families,&#8221; the group argued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents of gay marriage have won federal appeals court
victories in five states, with Indiana and Wisconsin joining the
list yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

Securities Group Inc. (8601) and Citigroup Inc. (C) were also among the
companies that passed the first phase of the selection process,
the Ministry of Finance said in a statement today. It plans to
select about 10 firms to manage the IPO, slated for next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The candidates will have to find ways to divest the postal,
banking and insurance giant without disrupting the stock market.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe&#8217;s administration hasn&#8217;t said how much
it expects to raise from the sale, which will help fund
reconstruction from the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The
offering will probably take place in phases and may exceed 4
trillion yen ($38 billion) in total, the previous government&#8217;s
Postal Reform Minister Mikio Shimoji said in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other foreign companies that made the cut are Barclays
Plc, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), UBS AG (UBSN) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the
statement showed. The remaining domestic firms are SMBC Nikko
Securities Inc., Mizuho Securities Co., Tokai Tokyo Financial
Holdings Inc., Okasan Securities Group Inc., SBI Holdings Inc.
and Ichiyoshi Securities Co. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As hackers pierced JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s (JPM) defenses in June, the bank&#8217;s cybersecurity chief was just getting acquainted with his employer and its sprawling technology infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Greg Rattray, a former U.S. Air Force commander for information warfare, became JPMorgan&#8217;s head of information security that month after upheaval at the highest levels of the bank&#8217;s tech division. His predecessor, Anthony Belfiore, had resigned early this year to join at least five JPMorgan leaders at First Data Corp. In between, Anish Bhimani was acting security officer while holding at least one other tech role. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It sucks that this happened at the beginning of Greg&#8217;s watch, but this is a legacy issue,&#8221; said Tom Kellermann, chief cybersecurity officer at anti-virus software firm Trend Micro Inc. &#8220;They had an acting person who was juggling way too much, with no one fully dedicated to the role for a bit of time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related: Computers for Hire Send JPMorgan Data to Russia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 58, has rushed to determine the scope of the assault and restore confidence in security at the biggest U.S. lender. While hackers targeted other banks&#8217; systems, JPMorgan is the only bank said to have had gigabytes of data stolen, including information on customer accounts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), at its own request,
was found in contempt of a court order to comply with a U.S.
warrant for e-mails stored in a data center in Ireland, so that
it can promptly appeal the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in Manhattan today
granted a joint request by Microsoft and the government to hold
the software maker in contempt. The judge imposed no further
sanctions and said the order permits the company to immediately
appeal her July 31 ruling that it has to produce e-mails of an
unidentified customer sought in a drug probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge in her July ruling rejected Microsoft&#8217;s argument
that the warrant,which requires the company to provide
investigators with the contents of the customer&#8217;s MSN.com Web-based e-mail, calls for an illegal search and seizure outside
the U.S. The nation in which the customer lives wasn&#8217;t
disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government should be required to get the e-mails
through procedures dictated by a law-enforcement treaty between
the U.S. and Ireland, Microsoft attorney E. Joshua Rosenkranz
argued. The Redmond, Washington-based company is the world&#8217;s
largest maker of computer software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for both sides argued over the reach of the Stored
Communications Act, or SCA, which allows law enforcement agents
to obtain information through subpoenas, court orders or
warrants, depending on the records sought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s general counsel, Brad Smith, said in a
statement after the July hearing that the company would appeal
promptly &#8220;and continue to advocate that people&#8217;s e-mail
deserves strong privacy protection in the U.S. and around the
world.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In the Matter of a Warrant to Search a Certain
E-Mail Account Controlled and Maintained by Microsoft Corp., 13-mj-02814, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s third-quarter earnings stand to get a boost from a 2007 investment in an automated-driving technology company that&#8217;s more than doubled since a July initial public offering. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bank owned 17.5 percent of Jerusalem-based Mobileye NV (MBLY), mostly through its Goldman Sachs Investment Partners hedge fund, before it helped take the firm public in July, according to filings related to the IPO. The shares priced at $25, above the initial range of $17 to $19, and rose as high as $53.91 today. That advance may lead to a third-quarter gain for New York-based Goldman Sachs of more than $200 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While calm markets have suppressed Goldman Sachs&#8217;s trading business, they have been a boon to investments the firm makes with its own money. The investing and lending unit earned the most profit of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s four major business segments in the 12 months ended in June, and gains in companies that went public drove better-than-expected earnings last quarter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs &#8220;has successfully established a strategy that should allow the firm to continue in the principal-investing business in the coming years,&#8221; Brad Hintz, a Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. analyst, said in a July note. &#8220;The wisdom of that strategy is clear,&#8221; Hintz said, as such gains in the second quarter &#8220;once again provided an unanticipated boost to performance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs invested $100 million in Mobileye in 2007, the first year the company had its driver-assistance EyeQ chip and algorithms put in new cars. The firm hasn&#8217;t said whether it added to that investment. Mobileye&#8217;s image-sensing technology uses a single camera to capture and display a vehicle&#8217;s surroundings, and anticipates potential collisions, according to the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Honda, Tesla &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mobileye, whose customers include Honda Motor Co. (7267) and luxury electric-carmaker Tesla Motors Inc., has leaped from a $1.5 billion valuation in July 2013 to a market capitalization of $10.8 billion today. Its $1 billion IPO on July 31 was the biggest in the U.S. by an Israeli company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The investment shows the potential of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s strategy of serving as adviser and principal with key clients. The bank generated about $18 million from its role as lead underwriter of Mobileye&#8217;s IPO, according to a regulatory filing, and advised the company last year when it received investments from firms including BlackRock Inc. (BLK) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the company, declined to comment on the firm&#8217;s holdings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The investing and lending unit includes direct investments in debt and equity, stakes in private equity and hedge funds, and loans to corporate and individual clients. The unit earned $4.26 billion before taxes in the 12 months ended in June, or 37 percent of the firm&#8217;s total, on $7.14 billion in revenue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Equity Gains &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gains from equity investments drove better-than-expected earnings last quarter and in the final three months of 2013. Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said in July that two-thirds of the $1.25 billion in equity gains for the second quarter came from companies that went public or experienced an event that resulted in a new valuation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A $200 million gain would represent about a quarter of equity investment revenue for the average of the past 10 quarters. The firm had $18 billion of investments in private equity and $4.33 billion in public stock as of June 30. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Analysts including Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s Keith Horowitz have said that shareholders give Goldman Sachs less credit for investing and lending gains because they&#8217;re seen as volatile and difficult to predict. Schwartz has said the activities are &#8220;core competencies&#8221; of the firm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;ELQ Investors &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eighty-six percent of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s stake in Mobileye before the IPO was held by Goldman Sachs Investment Partners, a hedge fund that includes client money and the bank&#8217;s own capital. The other 14 percent was a principal investment held through a subsidiary named ELQ Investors II Ltd. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ELQ sold $36 million of its stake in the IPO, leaving it with 1.7 percent of Mobileye&#8217;s shares. The remaining stake would be worth $176 million at the Sept. 5 closing price if ELQ didn&#8217;t sell more shares after the IPO. GSIP sold $105 million of Mobileye stock in the IPO, leaving it with 12.3 percent of the company, which would be worth $1.3 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The third-quarter gain for Goldman Sachs will depend on a number of factors, including how Mobileye&#8217;s stock trades in September and whether ELQ and GSIP maintain their post-IPO stakes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The shares gained as much as 7.9 percent today, after General Motors Co. said it would introduce a Cadillac model in two years that uses automated-driving technology. Detroit-based GM didn&#8217;t name potential technology suppliers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Mobileye Valuation &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which marks its investments to the current market price, hasn&#8217;t disclosed at what price it valued Mobileye on June 30. If it marked at $18, the midpoint of the original IPO range, ELQ would currently have a gain of $122 million. GSIP would have a $842 million gain, and Goldman Sachs would receive some cut of that as an investor in the fund. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s own money accounted for about 35 percent of the $7.5 billion in the fund in October 2009, according to marketing documents at the time. Since then, the assets have shrunk and Goldman Sachs has pulled money from hedge funds to eventually comply with the Volcker Rule, which sets a 3 percent limit for how much of a fund can be a bank&#8217;s own capital. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The fund, which is managed by Kenneth Eberts, Raanan Agus and Nick Advani, had about $5 billion in assets at the end of June, the Wall Street Journal reported last month. DuVally declined to say how much of the fund is the bank&#8217;s own money. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Volcker Rule &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Part of the unpredictability of investing and lending stems from Goldman&#8217;s need to exit $12 billion of the $14 billion in fund investments it had at the end of 2013 to comply with the Volcker Rule, Hintz wrote in June. The bank has said it will make those sales at a pace that won&#8217;t hurt other investors in the funds. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gains like the one from GSIP&#8217;s stake in Mobileye may provide an incentive for Goldman Sachs to take its time in redeeming its capital. Mobileye has jumped more than 35 percent since the start of trading on Aug. 26. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s own research analyst, Alexander Duval, issued his first recommendation of the stock that day. He rated the shares neutral. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Michael J.

&lt;p&gt;The European Central Bank&#8217;s decision
to boost stimulus measures was enough to make Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. change its mind about the short-term fate of the
global equity market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank raised its three-month rating on stocks to
overweight, the equivalent of buy, according to a report from
its portfolio strategy group. Higher bond yields pose less of an
imminent threat to equities following the ECB&#8217;s decision last
week to unexpectedly lower key interest rates and implement an
asset-buying plan, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upgrade is a reversal of a call made by Goldman Sachs
on July 26, when the firm cut its three-month rating on stocks
to neutral amid expectations that government bond yields would
increase. The bank maintained its 12-month overweight rating for
stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs sees &#8220;lower risk&#8221; from bonds following the
ECB decision, analysts led by chief global equity strategist
Peter Oppenheimer wrote in a Sept. 5 client note. &#8220;The net
effect of the policy action from here will be positive for
equity markets,&#8221; they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI All-Country World Index has rebounded 3.6 percent
over the last month since falling to an 11-week low on Aug. 7.
The gauge declined 0.4 percent at 10:39 a.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global equity measure climbed 0.2 percent last week as
the ECB reduced its three main interest rates by 10 basis
points, lowering the benchmark rate to 0.05 percent and the
deposit rate to minus 0.2 percent. ECB President Mario Draghi
said the central bank will announce details of an asset-backed
securities program after its October rate-setting meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 1.1 percent on the day of
the Sept. 4 announcement as two-year note yields fell below zero
in eight countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs isn&#8217;t alone in getting more bullish on
equities. Morgan Stanley chief U.S. equity strategist Adam Parker announced today an increase in the firm&#8217;s 12-month SP
500 forecast to 2,125. Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank AG strategist
David Bianco increased his year-end SP 500 target to 2,050 from
1,850 and his 2015 projection to 2,150. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will
probably succeed in its latest attempt to sell sukuk as
investors clamor for Islamic bonds, according to the manager of
the Middle East and Africa&#8217;s best performing sukuk fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buyers &#8220;have to look at different opportunities&#8221; with
demand outpacing supply, according to Abdul Kadir Hussain, who
oversees about $700 million as the chief executive officer of
Mashreq Capital DIFC Ltd. Goldman Sachs will meet investors in
the region this week before potentially selling a dollar-denominated, benchmark-sized issue through its unit JANY Sukuk
Co., people with knowledge of the deal said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based lender&#8217;s first foray into the Islamic
capital markets three years ago ended without a sale amid
criticism from scholars about the structure of its sukuk program
and the use of funds raised. This time the planned security will
be a Sukuk al Wakala, where one party entrusts another to act on
its behalf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ll definitely look at it,&#8221; Hussain said in a phone
interview from Dubai yesterday. &#8220;The structure was an issue&#8221;
last time and there were &#8220;a lot of other issuers in the
market,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Now the market is a lot tighter and there
is more capital.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors bid for 10-times the 200 million pounds ($327
million) that the U.K. sold in its debut offering in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Best Funds &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mashreq&#8217;s Capital DA01 and Al-Islami Income Fund are the
two best performing Islamic fixed-income funds in the Middle
East and Africa this year among 19 tracked by Bloomberg. They&#8217;ve
returned 7.7 percent and 6 percent respectively, compared with
5.6 percent for third placed Al Hilal Bank&#8217;s Global Sukuk Fund,
the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Like the U.K. issue, the Goldman Sachs deal is a
broadening of the sukuk market issuer base, and like that issue
this deal isn&#8217;t about the pricing or the valuation,&#8221; Hussain
said. &#8220;It&#8217;s about the signal that it sends.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average global sukuk yields declined 64 basis points this
year to 2.78 percent last week, according to an index from
Deutsche Bank AG. That compares with a 61 basis-point decline to
5.08 percent in average yields for emerging-market corporate
debt tracked by JPMorgan Chase  Co. indexes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Remaining Shy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs established a $2 billion program in 2011
based on a so-called commodity murabaha structure, or a cost
plus mark-up transaction. The program, blessed by eight of the
world&#8217;s top Islamic scholars, became entangled in a debate on
whether it met Shariah-compliant guidelines because it didn&#8217;t
ensure debt was traded at par, and it didn&#8217;t clarify how it
planned to use the funds raised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time Goldman Sachs along with Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank
PJSC, National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC, Emirates NBD Capital Ltd.
and NCB Capital will manage the new offering, the people said.
It plans to meet investors in the Middle East for two days
starting Sept. 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the investors conclude that Goldman Sachs is going to
take this money into their books and use it to finance their
conventional activities, then the investors are going to remain
a little bit shy,&#8221; Harris Irfan, managing director at European
Islamic Investment Bank, said by phone from London yesterday,
noting the new structure has solved the par-value obstacle, but
not issues with transparency. &#8220;I do hope they will be more
transparent on the flow of money,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Main Critic &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the presence of ADIB on the deal is &#8220;very
positive&#8221; as it was one of the main critics of Goldman Sachs&#8217;
earlier plans, Irfan said. The Shariah boards of ADIB and EIIB
share one scholar, according to the lenders&#8217; websites. ADIB&#8217;s
outsourced public relations company didn&#8217;t answer e-mailed
questions yesterday, and Sophie Ramsay, spokeswoman for Goldman
Sachs in London, declined to comment by telephone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About $72 billion of sukuk have been sold globally in the
year through yesterday, compared with $80 billion in the same
period in 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Islamic finance is a growing market both in terms of
issuers and investors,&#8221; Hussain said. &#8220;Goldman Sachs clearly
has decided that they want to play a role in this market both as
an issuer and I am sure also as an arranger and adviser.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest

&lt;p&gt;Kimmel will remain in Houston, where he&#8217;ll be responsible

&lt;p&gt;Record low volatility across equity
and debt markets could ease next year, boosting Wall Street
firms&#8217; trading operations, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Financial
Officer Marianne Lake said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unusually calm markets and low client activity that
caused the worst first half in trading since the financial
crisis will probably continue through the middle of 2015, Lake
said today at a conference in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It may be a tale of two cities where the first half looks
a little bit more like a continuation of some the things we&#8217;d
been seeing this year, but there may be greener pastures in the
second half,&#8221; Lake said. &#8220;When things change, they can change
very, very quickly, so we want to be positioned for that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s corporate and investment bank, run by Daniel Pinto, posted a 12 percent revenue drop to $17.6 billion in the
first six months of 2014. Firms may have to wait until 2016
before markets significantly improve, Pinto said in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will benefit from cost-cutting programs in retail
and institutional units and &#8220;more finality&#8221; on rules governing
capital at the biggest banks, Lake said today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iron-ore&#8217;s plunge to five-year lows
would make exports from Brazilian producers including Cia.
Siderurgica Nacional SA (CSNA3) and Gerdau SA (GGBR4) unprofitable, Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 50 million metric tons a year of Brazilian iron-ore
output would be unprofitable at prices that last week fell below
$84 a ton for the first time since 2009, Goldman analysts led by
Marcelo Aguiar said in a research note today. While local
transport costs probably will decline and make exports more
viable, the reduction won&#8217;t be immediate, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miners that don&#8217;t have their own railway and port
operations &#8220;will likely be under strong pressure in the short-and near-term given the low iron-ore price environment,&#8221; the
Sao Paulo-based analysts wrote. &#8220;The low profitability of
Brazilian small and mid-size iron-ore miners could be a barrier
for export volume growth from Brazil in the near term.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron-ore, the key ingredient in the production of steel,
has lost 38 percent this year on signs of weakening demand
growth in China as Vale SA, BHP Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto

&lt;p&gt;Ore with 62 percent content at the Chinese port of Qingdao

&lt;h2&gt;Projects&#8217; Jeopardy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gerdau declined to comment on Goldman&#8217;s analysis when
contacted by Bloomberg News today. CSN, the second-largest
listed Brazilian iron-ore company, didn&#8217;t reply to an e-mail
seeking comment. Either did Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais
SA, also listed by Goldman as a producer that would have export
losses at current prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only Rio de Janeiro-based Vale (VALE5), the world&#8217;s largest iron-ore producer, would generate positive operating cash flow in
Brazil at current prices, Goldman also said in the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several Brazil iron-ore projects expected to start
producing in the next five years would be canceled or halted
because of the lower prices of the raw material, putting at risk
about 45 million tons a year of expansion potential, the
analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wall Street banks including Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. are rushing to issue U.S.
dollar bonds in Taiwan after a rule change unlocked $586 billion
of funds held by the island&#8217;s insurance companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman sold $974 million of 30-year notes last month in
the largest such issuance on the island, leading $7.3 billion in
greenback debt offers this year, versus zero a year earlier.
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC estimates U.S. issuers can obtain
lower costs than they would at home, after lawmakers in May
excluded locally issued foreign-currency bonds from a 45 percent
cap on the amount insurance firms can invest in overseas assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taiwanese insurers&#8217; yearly premium income has more than
doubled in the past decade as China&#8217;s export-manufacturing boom
boosted the island&#8217;s wealth. Their hunt for fixed-income
investments has cut the 10-year sovereign yield 116 basis points
in the past 10 years to 1.71 percent, the 13th-lowest globally,
compared with 2.49 percent in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With Taiwan&#8217;s very low benchmark-rate environment, a lot
of domestic-currency investments have low yields,&#8221; said Godwin Chang, head of Taiwan at Societe Generale AG, which sold $1.21
billion of bonds in the territory this year. &#8220;Life insurers are
better off having more foreign-currency investments.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Negative Spread &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank cut its policy rate to a record low 1.25
percent in 2009 and maintained it at 1.875 percent in the past
13 quarters. As domestic rates fell, life insurance firms
boosted holdings of foreign assets to 44 percent as of June 30
from 38 percent at the end of 2011, according to the Taiwan
Insurance Institute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insurance industry&#8217;s 3.8 percent weighted average
liability cost was significantly higher than its recurring
investment yield of 2.8 percent in 2013, according to a June
presentation by the financial regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman issued its zero-coupon, 30-year bonds at a price to
yield 4.96 percent last week. Morgan Stanley&#8217;s notes due 2044
paid a coupon of 4.7 percent and Citigroup&#8217;s similar-maturity,
zero-coupon debt was sold at 4.88 percent. All of the dollar
notes sold on the island since May&#8217;s amendment are callable by
the issuer and mature in 20 or 30 years, while 74 percent pay
zero coupon, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Foreign-currency notes issued in Taiwan are called Formosa bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Callable notes are popular among insurers, which can demand
higher yields to boost returns, J.P. Morgan strategists led by
Joshua Younger wrote in an Aug. 22 note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Because they are considered domestic investments from a
regulatory perspective, Formosa bonds are generally compared
against Taiwan dollar-denominated fixed-income products,&#8221; the
strategists wrote. &#8220;With Taiwan dollar rates quite low by
comparison, yield-sensitive investors are likely to lower their
return targets for U.S. dollar callable Formosa bonds relative
to those registered overseas.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bond Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The May 20 amendment also spurred issuances in yuan bonds,
with lenders such as Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. and Bank of
China Ltd. selling 9.3 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) of debt in
Taiwan since then, compared with 1.5 billion yuan in the first
four months of 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local insurers&#8217; total annual premium income grew an average
8 percent in each of the last 10 years to NT$2.7 trillion ($90
billion) in 2013 from NT$1.2 trillion in 2003, according to
Financial Supervisory Commission data. Premiums collected added
up to 17.6 percent of gross domestic product in 2013, the
world&#8217;s highest penetration rate, a Swiss Re Ltd. report shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Insurer Interest &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For insurers whose investments abroad haven&#8217;t yet neared
the 45 percent limit, the locally issued foreign-currency bonds
are not the most attractive. Cathay Life Insurance Co. (2882), the
largest in the industry with NT$4.3 trillion of assets, has
bought very few of the foreign-currency notes as they offer
rates lower than similar securities overseas, executive vice
president Joseph Wang said at an Aug. 29 briefing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other companies have been more enthusiastic. Shinkong
Insurance Co. (2850) has spent NT$42.8 billion on locally issued
foreign debt and plans to buy more to boost returns, according
to an Aug. 28 presentation. Fubon Life Insurance Co. aims to
increase its holdings to NT$100 billion within a year, the
Economic Daily News reported on Aug. 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the dollar debt sold in Taiwan since May&#8217;s rule
change has been bought by the insurance industry, according to
Mark Liu, Taipei-based head of global markets at Societe
Generale. The French bank is speaking with European companies
both in and outside the financial sector regarding bond
issuances in Taiwan, Chang said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Expectations Tempered &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may be a good time to sell debt as borrowing costs
will probably rise. Eight of 18 analysts in a Bloomberg poll
expect Taiwan to raise its policy rate at least once by the end
of this year. The island&#8217;s economy is showing signs of a
recovery this year. Data yesterday showed exports grew 9.6
percent in August, the most in 20 months. Sixty-six percent of
Taiwan&#8217;s shipments went to China, which this week posted a
record trade surplus for August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., 62 of 74 economists in another survey see a
Federal Reserve interest-rate increase by the third quarter of
next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors have already tempered their expectations for a
rate increase, according to Cosmas Lu, chief executive officer
at the Taipei branch of Barclays Plc, which lists its $600
million of 30-year bonds on the bond exchange GreTai Securities
Market today. Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields have declined 54
basis points in 2014 as Fed Chair Janet Yellen signaled the
monetary authority&#8217;s commitment to low borrowing costs amid
mixed U.S. economic data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Taiwan&#8217;s investors have been pretty quiet in the first
half of the year, waiting for interest rates to rise, which
didn&#8217;t happen,&#8221; Lu said in an Aug. 27 phone interview. &#8220;So
they&#8217;re very cash-rich and they realize they can&#8217;t wait forever.
There&#8217;s definitely very big demand from investors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By negotiating to sell his gaming startup to Microsoft (MSFT) Corp., Minecraft creator Markus Persson is growing closer to a company he once publicly lambasted -- and has a chance of becoming a billionaire at the age of 35. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Swede, who&#8217;s gained 1.8 million Twitter followers and the admiration of gamers worldwide after creating Minecraft in 2009, has used his fame to pour scorn on companies from Facebook Inc. (FB) to Electronic Arts Inc. while touting the values of being &#8220;indie.&#8221; Microsoft, a $386 billion giant dominating the global software industry, has received its fair share of Persson&#8217;s appraisal of large corporations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Got an email from microsoft, wanting to help &#8216;certify&#8217; minecraft for win 8,&#8221; Persson wrote on Twitter in September 2012, referring to Microsoft&#8217;s Windows 8 software. &#8220;I told them to stop trying to ruin the pc as an open platform.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;d rather have minecraft not run on win 8 at all than to play along,&#8221; Persson, known for his black hat and dubbed &#8220;Notch&#8221; by the Minecraft community, posted that same day. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Persson&#8217;s comments about Microsoft have become less harsh since, and a sale to the Redmond, Washington-based company would cement a relationship that&#8217;s been strengthening recently. Microsoft, maker of the Xbox video-game console, is in talks to buy Persson&#8217;s company, Mojang AB, for more than $2 billion, people with knowledge of the talks said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York state&#8217;s pension fund is
giving Goldman Sachs Asset Management $2 billion to invest in
global stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s the first time the $180.7 billion fund has formed such
a partnership, state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, the pension&#8217;s
sole trustee, said today in a statement. In addition to
investing the funds with equity managers, the unit of Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will also provide advice across the pension&#8217;s
remaining $98 billion equity portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Identifying new opportunities is key to the continued
growth of the fund&#8217;s long-term value,&#8221; DiNapoli said. It will
give the pension &#8220;full access to world-class global equity
investment opportunities and the nimbleness to take advantage of
them on a timely basis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York joins public pension funds including New Jersey,
New York City and the Teacher Retirement System of Texas in
making big allocations of capital to investment managers that
can be deployed more quickly and across different strategies.
Such separately managed accounts offer cheaper fees and more
control for investors, who in turn agree to commit large sums
for a decade or more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Landmark&#8217; Deal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2011, Texas committed as much as $3 billion each to KKR
 Co. (KKR) and Apollo Global Management LLC, while New Jersey gave as
much as $1.5 billion to Blackstone Group LP. New Jersey&#8217;s State
Investment Council said the deal would save the state about $120
million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s partnership with New York state is the
largest it has ever done, said Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman for
the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, the South Carolina Retirement System Investment
Commission created several strategic partnerships, including one
with Goldman Sachs. The firm managed $1.15 billion as of June
30, 2013, according to a report from the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010, New York-based Goldman Sachs received $500 million
from the Alaska Permanent Fund to manage with a goal of
returning 5 percentage points more than inflation. The bank had
$725 million at the end of July, and had returned 8.03 percent
in the past three years, ahead of its 6.79 percent target,
according to a report from the Alaskan fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timothy O&#8217;Neill and Eric Lane, global co-heads of the
investment management division at Goldman Sachs, said the New
York deal is a &#8220;landmark assignment&#8221; for the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are excited to provide customized access to our broad
open-architecture platform, due diligence expertise and
portfolio construction capabilities,&#8221; they said jointly in the
e-mailed statement from DiNapoli. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s alternative investments and manager
selection group, run by Chris Kojima, supervises $156 billion,
Raphael said. The unit selects and performs due diligence on
long-only portfolio managers for institutional investors, in
addition to running funds of funds in private equity and hedge
funds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. and European Union are poised to halt billions of dollars in oil exploration in Russia by the world&#8217;s largest energy companies in sanctions that would cut deeper than previously disclosed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new sanctions over Ukraine would prohibit U.S. and European cooperation in searching Russia&#8217;s Arctic, deep seas or shale formations for crude, according to three U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because the measures haven&#8217;t been made public. If implemented, they would affect companies from Dallas to London, including Exxon Mobil Corp. and BP Plc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EU ambassadors met today and will resume deliberations tomorrow in Brussels on whether to trigger added sanctions or wait longer to see if a cease-fire holds between Ukraine and pro-Russian separatists and if Russia backs moves toward a longer-term agreement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once the EU implemented the new ban on sharing energy technology and services, the U.S. would follow suit with a similar package, including barring the export of U.S. gear and expertise for the specialized exploration that the Russians are unequipped to pursue on their own, the U.S. officials said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EU governments agreed on these oil-related sanctions on Sept. 8 as part of a wider package of measures intended to hobble Russia&#8217;s finance, defense and energy industries, pending evaluation of the cease-fire declared in Ukraine last week, according to two European officials who also spoke on condition that they not be named. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG), the
first publicly traded hedge-fund and private-equity manager in
the U.S., hired Adam Rosenberg from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to
lead credit investments in gaming and leisure companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosenberg, who was global head of gaming investment banking
at Goldman Sachs, spent 16 years at the New York-based
investment bank, according to a statement today. Previously he
was a lawyer at Skadden Arps Slate Meagher  Flom LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortress has been hiring from Wall Street as banks struggle
to retain senior staff amid lower pay and heightened scrutiny
from regulators. Earlier this year it hired Jeffrey Feig from
Citigroup Inc. to be co-president of the liquid markets business
with Mike Novogratz, and the firm hired former Deutsche Bank AG
currency trader Christopher Faly for the group. Fortress also
hired Rajeev Misra, UBS AG&#8217;s former co-head of fixed income, and
Adam Siegel, a former trader at Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc. Siegel will work with Michael Nierenberg, who joined from
Bank of America Corp. last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortress&#8217;s main macro hedge fund lost 2.3 percent last
month and 5.8 percent this year, according to a regulatory
filing this week. The firm is doing better in its credit-focused
strategies, with the Drawbridge Special Opportunities Fund
rising 0.6 percent in July to lift its 2014 gain through that
month to 6.4 percent, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortress, based in New York, rose 0.4 percent to $7.31 at
10:53 a.m. in New York. The stock is down 60 percent since the
company&#8217;s February 2007 initial public offering. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s asset-management arm is the lead investor in a transaction to purchase stakes in two older distressed-debt funds overseen by a former unit of Carlyle Group LP&#8217;s TCW Group Inc., two people with knowledge of the deal said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management agreed to lead a syndicate that will buy stakes from investors in 2002 and 2005 funds run by Crescent Capital Group LP, which separated from TCW in 2011, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. The deal size would be about $350 million, including net asset value and new investment capital. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Crescent Capital, the Los Angeles-based firm headed by co-founders Mark Attanasio and Jean-Marc Chapus, hired UBS AG to run the sales process, which would offer its investors a way to exit their holdings, the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s asset-management arm, which oversees $935 billion, is deploying capital in a competitive secondary market where deal volume is expected to exceed $30 billion this year as buyers bid up prices to post-crisis highs, according to a July report from Dallas-based investment bank Cogent Partners. Goldman Sachs bid 94.8 percent of net asset value for stakes in the 2002 fund in August, according to memo on the Fresno County Employees&#8217; Retirement Association website. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman at New York-based Goldman Sachs, declined to comment on the deal, as did Bill Mendel, a spokesman for Crescent Capital with Mendel Communications and Megan Stinson, a spokeswoman for UBS. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fresh Capital &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several private-equity firms have sought to restructure older funds to gather fresh capital or secure time to sell investments in recent years. Chicago-based Lake Capital Partners LP, after deciding against raising another buyout fund more than a decade ago, was considering allowing clients to sell their stakes in its 2002 pool, two people briefed on the matter said in July. Diamond Castle Holdings LLC, the New York-based firm started by executives from Credit Suisse Group AG, and Boston-based J.W. Childs Associates LP have explored similar deals. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Crescent Capital is letting investors exit TCW Shared Opportunity Fund IV, a $250 million pool nearing the end of its life. Crescent would manage the fund on Goldman&#8217;s behalf while it sells the remaining investments. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investors agreed to extend the term of the fund, originally scheduled to expire in December 2010, until the end of this year, according to the Fresno County memo. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;California&#8217;s Fresno County committed $15 million to the 2002 fund, which was producing a 6.5 percent net internal rate of return as of June 30, another memo shows. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Crescent Capital &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Crescent Capital raised its last distressed-focused fund almost a decade ago. TCW Shared Opportunity Fund V, which gathered about $525 million in 2005, has backed Banc of California Inc. and First PacTrust Bancorp Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The private-equity firm, which invests in corporate debt securities, managed about $15 billion in commitments and capital as of Dec. 31, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management, which oversees $935 billion, invests in fixed income, money markets, public equity, commodities, hedge funds, private equity and real estate. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Sabrina Willmer in New York at swillmer2@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editors responsible for this story: Christian Baumgaertel at cbaumgaertel@bloomberg.net Josh Friedman, Sree Vidya Bhaktavatsalam &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) executive
Kurt DelBene is joining Madrona Venture Group as a partner where
he&#8217;ll help the Seattle-based firm identify new investments and
work on strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DelBene, most recently spent six months as senior adviser
to the U.S. secretary of Health and Human Services, where he
managed the Obamacare insurance enrollment program. Prior to
that, he spent 21 years at Microsoft, most recently as president
of the company&#8217;s Office division, before leaving in 2013 amid a
reorganization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madrona focuses on early-stage technology companies in the
U.S. Northwest. Founded in 1995, the firm&#8217;s past investments
include Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Redfin Corp., the online real-estate
brokerage. DelBene said his time at Microsoft has given him
experience in both consumer and enterprise businesses that he&#8217;ll
be able to apply at Madrona. While at the software maker he also
worked on starting up newer areas such as the cloud-based
versions of Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The tech community in the Seattle area is just exploding
so it was an opportunity to feel like I could make a
contribution while having fun as well,&#8221; he said by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seattle is in the midst of boom led by online businesses
such as Zillow Inc., Blue Nile Inc. and Zulily Inc., as well as
Amazon, that&#8217;s made it the fastest-growing among the top 50 U.S.
cities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DelBene said he was talking to Madrona when he left
Microsoft and put the discussions on hold when President Barack Obama recruited him to improve the federal health exchange. He
committed to a six-month effort there and asked Madrona to
restart discussions with him when that finished. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&#8217;s married to U.S. Representative Suzan DelBene, a
Democrat from Washington state, who is running for re-election
and is also a former Microsoft executive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc (BARC) appointed former
Goldman Sachs Group Inc executive Khaled Eldabag as co-head for
investment banking in the Middle East and North Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eldabag will work with David Nataf, who was promoted as the
regional co-head for investment banking in the region, according
to an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg News. The contents of
the memo were confirmed by a Dubai-based spokesman for the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays is pursuing growth in emerging markets such as the
Middle East and Africa as accelerating economies revive investor
demand for share sales and mergers and acquisitions. The bank
appointed Makram Azar as chairman for the Middle East and North
Africa in June, replacing chief executive John Vitalo, who left
in April to join former Barclays CEO Robert Diamond&#8217;s Africa
investment vehicle Atlas Mara Co-Nvest Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Khaled and David&#8217;s appointment build on the success of
Barclays&#8217; investment banking franchise in MENA,&#8221; Azar said in
an e-mailed statement to Bloomberg News. &#8220;This is a clear
reflection of our commitment to grow Barclays&#8217; business in the
region.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment banks in the Middle East are reviving banking
hires as deal activity picks up, after cutting jobs during the
global financial crisis. UBS AG is relocating Alberto Palombi,
head of the investment bank&#8217;s global sovereign wealth fund
business, to Dubai from London, people familiar with the matter
said in April. Goldman Sachs and Renaissance Capital Ltd. are
among banks bulking up their equity business in Dubai, according
to people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United Arab Emirates and Qatar were raised to emerging-market status from frontier by index provider MSCI Inc. in 2013,
encouraging more foreign investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays is advising Abu Dhabi-based Al Jaber Group in a
potential sale of its transportation and lifting unit, people
familiar with the matter said last month. The bank plans to
boost hiring at its corporate banking business in Dubai, Rezwan
Mirza, head of that business in the United Arab Emirates and
Gulf countries, said in a May 26 interview &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nataf joined Barclays in 2008 and was most recently a
managing director at the bank. Eldabag handled several roles at
Goldman including as co-head of investment banking for Middle
East and head of client coverage and head of MA in the region,
according to the memo. He left the bank last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iron ore declined sooner than
expected this year as supplies exceeded demand and prices are
unlikely to recover, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
which said 2014 will mark the end of a so-called iron age. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year &#8220;is the inflection point where new production
capacity finally catches up with demand growth, and profit
margins begin their reversion to the historical mean,&#8221; analysts
Christian Lelong and Amber Cai wrote in a report today titled:
&#8220;The end of the Iron Age.&#8221;  The 2016 forecast for seaborne ore
was cut to $79 a metric ton from $82 and the 2017 outlook was
reduced to $78 from $85, according to the New-York based bank,
which stuck with a forecast for $80 next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The raw material tumbled into a bear market this year as
the biggest producers including Rio Tinto (RIO) Group expanded low-cost output, betting higher volumes would more than offset
falling prices while less competitive mines were forced to
close. The decline in prices came sooner than expected,
according to Goldman, which said in November that iron ore would
probably drop at least 15 percent this year. The commodity is
seen in a structural downtrend, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The price decline has been dramatic, but a weak demand
outlook in China and the structural nature of the surplus make a
recovery unlikely,&#8221; Lelong and Cai wrote. &#8220;Lower prices for
iron ore and steel are unlikely to boost demand in a material
way. Instead, the day when steel production in China will peak
gets ever closer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lowest Level &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ore with 62 percent content at the Chinese port of Qingdao
fell 39 percent to $82.22 a dry ton this year, the lowest level
since September 2009, according to data from Metal Bulletin Ltd.
The Bloomberg Commodity Index (BCOM), which doesn&#8217;t include iron ore as
a member, lost 2 percent in the period. Within the index,
soybeans fell the most. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the surplus emerged, iron ore supplies were tight
and producers had above-trend profits even as costs increased,
according to Lelong and Cai. That period, dubbed by the bank as
the Iron Age, is now ending, they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The current exploitation phase in iron ore could last for
a decade,&#8221; the analysts wrote. &#8220;Iron ore markets went through
a 20-year period of declining prices in real terms during the
previous exploitation phase that ended in 2004.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global surplus will more than triple to 163 million
tons in 2015 from 52 million tons this year, according to
Goldman. The glut was seen expanding to 245 million tons in 2016
295 million tons in 2017 and 334 million tons in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Producers&#8217; View &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest suppliers see higher prices. Ore may increase
as the higher-cost output exits the market, Nev Power, chief
executive officer of Perth-based Fortescue (FMG) Metals Group Ltd.,
said in an Aug. 20 interview on Bloomberg Television. Vale SA
also sees prices rebounding as supply growth slows and mines
close, Jose Carlos Martins, the Rio de Janeiro-based company&#8217;s
head of ferrous and strategy, said on July 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron ore may see a dramatic recovery this half, Paul Gait,
an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said in a report on July 9,
citing factors including a seasonal increase in the second six
months and an end to China&#8217;s policy tightening. Asia&#8217;s largest
economy accounts for about 67 percent of seaborne demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit growth in China missed estimates in July and new-home prices fell in almost all the cities the government tracks,
putting pressure on policy makers to step up stimulus as they
seek to meet an economic growth target of 7.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 110 million tons of global supply will close next
year and a further 75 million tons in 2016, Goldman estimated in
the report. While the majority of closures would be in China,
seaborne producers will not go unscathed, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Exceed Demand&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;New seaborne iron ore supply delivered into China is
expected to exceed demand growth over the next three to four
years,&#8221; Daniel Kang, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase  Co. in Hong
Kong, said by e-mail in response to Bloomberg questions. &#8220;In
short, we see iron ore in a structural downtrend.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rio Tinto, the biggest supplier after Vale, plans to boost
output to more than 330 million tons in 2015, according to a
company estimate. Vale will raise production 8.4 percent to 348
million tons in 2015. BHP Billiton Ltd. sees an 8.9 percent
increase from its Western Australian mines in the year from July
1, while Fortescue may boost shipments by 25 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortescue&#8217;s stock declined 32 percent in Australia this
year, while in London Rio shares lost 5 percent and BHP rose 0.4
percent. In Brazil, Vale dropped 23 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The shift into structural oversupply is barely six months
old but seaborne prices have already declined 38 percent year-to-date,&#8221; Lelong and Cai wrote. &#8220;Rather than representing the
trough for this cycle, we believe the downward pressure is set
to continue.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has
scrapped its forecast for the Reserve Bank of India to raise
borrowing costs after a pickup in monsoon rains and a drop in
oil prices tempered the inflation outlook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. lender, which had expected a 50-basis-point
increase in the benchmark repurchase rate this year followed by
a reduction of the same magnitude in the second half of 2015,
now sees the RBI staying on hold through the end of next year,
it said in a report. Consumer-price (INFUTOTY) gains slowed to 7.8 percent
in August, from as high as 11.16 percent in November, the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey shows before data due Sept. 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Near-term risks to inflation have receded due to weaker
oil prices and a significantly improved monsoon,&#8221; Tushar Poddar, an economist at Goldman in Mumbai, wrote in the report
dated yesterday. &#8220;While our base case is now for the RBI to
remain on hold, the probability of a rate hike is higher than
that of a rate cut. The biggest change under the new government
has been a more investor-friendly mindset.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measures taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who took
office after a landslide election win in May, will spur economic
growth, lure capital inflows and support the rupee, Goldman said
in the report. A shortfall in India&#8217;s annual rains, crucial for
crops from sugar to rice and cotton, has narrowed to 11 percent
from more than 40 percent in June, official data show, and Brent
crude prices have retreated 14 percent from this year&#8217;s high of
$115.71 per barrel in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quickening Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman predicts Asia&#8217;s third-largest economy will expand
5.6 percent in the fiscal year through March 2015. Gross
domestic product increased 4.7 percent in the previous period, a
pace that was near the decade-low 4.5 percent recorded the year
before. The U.S. lender still sees the rupee weakening to 61 per
dollar, 62 and 63 in three, six and 12 months. The currency fell
0.4 percent to 60.8225 as of 9:21 a.m. in Mumbai, according to
prices from local banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan, who raised borrowing costs
three times in the past year to combat inflation, has left them
unchanged since January. The central bank will hold the
benchmark rate at 8 percent through the end of 2014, according
to 16 of 26 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Four see a reduction
to 7.75 percent, while five estimate a 25-basis-point increase
and one expects an advance to 8.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modi&#8217;s decisions to cut red tape and allow more foreign
investment in industries including railways and defense have
buoyed investor confidence, Goldman said in the report. The
rupee has rebounded 13 percent from a record low of 68.845 per
dollar reached in August 2013, the world&#8217;s best-performing
emerging-market currency over that period, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think the Indian rupee will continue to trade in a
narrow range, with the RBI intervening to prevent any sharp
appreciation,&#8221; Goldman&#8217;s Poddar wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lincoln National Corp. (LNC) hired Chris Giovanni, an analyst from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., as the
insurer&#8217;s head of investor relations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He replaces James Sjoreen, who previously announced he
would retire at the end of this year, Radnor, Pennsylvania-based
Lincoln said today in a statement. Giovanni, who had a neutral
rating on Lincoln, will report to Chief Financial Officer Randal Freitag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lincoln joins larger rivals MetLife Inc. and Prudential
Financial Inc. in turning to Wall Street for staff to oversee
relations with investors and analysts. Prudential in June hired
Mark Finkelstein, an analyst from Evercore Partners Inc. MetLife
in 2012 hired Edward Spehar from Bank of America Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giovanni &#8220;has demonstrated his keen understanding of
business drivers through his analyst work, and we will benefit
immediately from his insight,&#8221; Freitag said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lincoln also recruited from New York-based Goldman Sachs in
2012 when it hired Ellen Cooper as chief investment officer. The
insurer had a portfolio valued at more than $100 billion as of
June 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giovanni worked for Goldman Sachs since 2006. He most
recently was a vice president and was the bank&#8217;s lead analyst
for life insurers, a coverage group of 17 companies, according
to today&#8217;s statement. He has a bachelor&#8217;s degree from Loyola

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) and 21st Century Fox Inc. are in discussions to supply Sony Corp. (6758) with programming for its planned Internet-based TV service, according to people familiar with the conversations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney and Fox would join Viacom Inc. (VIAB), which said yesterday it will provide 22 networks, the first time the media company, headed by Chairman Sumner Redstone, has made its shows available for a Web-based service. The deal covers live and on-demand programming, Viacom and Sony said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sony&#8217;s service will debut with &#8220;major programmers,&#8221; according to yesterday&#8217;s statement. The company wouldn&#8217;t specify when, or identify potential partners. No deal with Disney or Fox is imminent, said the people, who asked not to be named because the talks are private. Sony shares rose. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sony is clearly beefing up content offerings for its growth plans for its Entertainment Network division, recently merged with its gaming unit,&#8221; Amir Anvarzadeh, a manager of Japanese equity sales at BGC Partners Inc. in Singapore, said by e-mail. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Television, telephone and technology companies are exploring cable-like packages streamed over the Internet to reach younger viewers who aren&#8217;t signing up for traditional cable and satellite TV. Progress has been slow. Intel Corp. (INTC) abandoned a planned Web-TV service this year. Dish Network Corp. (DISH) secured rights to carry Disney channels like ESPN in an online package separate from its satellite-TV business. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Verizon Plans &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Verizon Communications Inc. is planning an Internet-based offering by mid-2015 after acquiring the supporting technology from Intel Corp. earlier this year, Chief Executive Officer Lowell McAdam said today at a Goldman Sachs conference in New York. Verizon&#8217;s mobile-video-streaming technology could let it offer live video from major broadcasters along with on-demand programming, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Viacom deal with Sony took a more than a year to complete after a preliminary accord. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;ll benefit every party in the ecosystem we have all enjoyed,&#8221; Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman said yesterday at the Goldman Sachs conference. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dauman praised the &#8220;elegant consumer interface&#8221; of Sony&#8217;s service and said the Tokyo-based company was a natural partner given the popularity of its gaming devices among the young viewers who watch Viacom&#8217;s cable channels. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Discovery Communications Inc. (DISCA), Time Warner Inc. (TWX) and Starz are also among the companies discussing offering their programs through Sony, the New York Times reported earlier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Numerous Partners &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The service will launch with numerous major network partners, but we aren&#8217;t providing specifics at this time including who we are speaking to,&#8221; Sean Yoneda, a spokesman for Sony in the U.S., said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chris LaPlaca, a spokesman for Disney&#8217;s ESPN, declined to say whether the network was speaking to Sony. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We remain platform agnostic and are always looking for new and innovative ways to serve our fans, consistent with the approach we are taking with our current distribution partners,&#8221; LaPlaca said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nathaniel Brown, a spokesman for Fox (FOXA), declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The partnership announced yesterday unites more than 75 million Internet-enabled Sony devices in U.S. homes with Viacom&#8217;s programming, Sony said. Viewers can watch shows such as &#8220;SpongeBob SquarePants&#8221; and &#8220;Teen Wolf&#8221; on TVs, game consoles and Blu-ray players. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Boosting Investment &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sony CEO Kazuo Hirai has boosted investment in content production and TV networks as he pushes his &#8220;One Sony&#8221; vision to unite products, including mobile devices and TVs, with games, music and films as it competes against Samsung Electronics Co. (005930), the world&#8217;s biggest maker of phones and televisions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sony shares rose 2.7 percent to 2,105 yen at the close in Tokyo. The company&#8217;s American depositary receipts climbed 1.2 percent to $19.74 at 10:14 a.m. in New York. Viacom shares were little changed at $79.86. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;A good lineup is important for this service because users will choose a service with a lot of content,&#8221; said Hideki Yasuda, a Tokyo-based analyst at Ace Research Institute. &#8220;It&#8217;s also a way for Sony to differentiate itself from Samsung.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Viacom owns and operates the largest basic-cable portfolio in the U.S. by audience share, said Sony, citing Nielsen data. The cloud-based TV service will stream Comedy Central, VH1 and Spike, among others, as well as Viacom&#8217;s full video-on-demand package. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The deal earlier this year with Burbank, California-based Disney gave Dish, Charlie Ergen&#8217;s satellite-TV company, rights to carry the Disney Channel, ABC and ESPN. That put Dish ahead of Sony in the race to become the first to offer a service known as over-the-top, or OTT, because it runs over an Internet connection. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;OTT Stalled &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Negotiations for the right to stream popular TV channels have slowed the development of every planned OTT service, because distributors need a minimum number of channels to offer a product robust enough to compete with traditional pay-TV. Every major TV programmer has explored such deals. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;What they are trying to do is figure out a way to get younger consumers and some cohorts that are not obviously going to subscribe to big packages and bundles of channels, and give them really an on-ramp to starting in the experience of subscribing and getting something that fits them,&#8221; Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes said at the Goldman conference. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a very worthy thing to try to figure this out.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Lucas Shaw in Los Angeles at lshaw31@bloomberg.net; Anousha Sakoui in London at asakoui@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editors responsible for this story: Anthony Palazzo at apalazzo@bloomberg.net; Sarah Rabil at srabil@bloomberg.net Stephen West &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) is bringing the hit
movie &#8220;Frozen&#8221; to its Epcot theme park in Florida. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new attraction, based on the Arendelle kingdom in
&#8220;Frozen,&#8221; will replace the Maelstrom ride at Epcot&#8217;s Norway
Pavilion, Disney Parks  Resorts Chairman Thomas Staggs said
said today in a blog post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney is adding &#8220;Frozen&#8221; attractions to a number of its
parks. Starting in November, the company will transform
Cinderella Castle at its Magic Kingdom near Orlando into an ice
palace for the holidays. Several &#8220;Frozen&#8221; characters will
appear in a Christmas parade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Frozen,&#8221; released in 2013, is the fifth-highest grossing
movie of all time, with $1.27 billion in global receipts,
according to Box Office Mojo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, fell less than 1

&lt;p&gt;Cash is dirty and flimsy. It comes with no official rebate or reward programs. Worst of all, you can&#8217;t stuff it into a smartphone or laptop to pay for something online. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet there are no real substitutes for cold hard cash. Despite predictions of a cashless society, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing and the U.S. Mint churn out more currency and coins every year. The average American still uses cash for dozens of transaction each month, despite the wealth of alternatives, from good old plastic to virtual currencies to &#8220;point and pay&#8221; apps like the upcoming Apple Pay service. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cash has advantages these high-tech replacements can't match. It won't run out of battery power, for one thing. It's anonymous -- invisible to the IRS, law enforcement and hackers, as well as to irritating marketers and data brokers. As Cass Sunstein notes, paying only in cash can also be a great way to monitor spending and stick to a budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average person pays with cash about 23 times a month, according to an analysis by the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank. While credit card use has doubled since 2000 and debit card use is up fivefold, cash is still used more often than either option. It&#8217;s most often used for transactions under $25, even by those who claim to prefer credit or debit cards overall. And 40 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds say cash is their preferred form of payment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some $1.2 trillion in cash circulates outside of banks -- 15,000 tons worth. That&#8217;s up 20 percent since 2011, and is the equivalent of $3,836 squeezed under the mattresses of every U.S. man, woman and child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The location of all these "Benjamins" -- it's mostly in $100 bills -- is a puzzle to economists and currency experts. When asked how much money they kept in their wallet or house, the average U.S. respondent said a little more than $40 in the wallet and $100 in the house, according to a 2013 Tufts University study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the money may be overseas. Less than a quarter of U.S. currency resides abroad, estimates University of Wisconsin economist Edgar Feige. Where&#8217;s the rest? Legitimate business owners and those without bank accounts rely heavily on cash. And some is hidden away by the real-life equivalents of Breaking Bad&#8217;s Walter White in an underground &#8220;cash only&#8221; economy. The U.S. may lose more than $100 billion a year in taxes on unreported income of over $400 billion, according to the Tufts study and others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using cash can help people carefully track their own spending, as Sunstein says. But one of its most convenient features is that it keeps everyone else in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More stories by Ben Steverman:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine&#8217;s deteriorating economic
outlook is increasing the likelihood of a default that could

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A six-month conflict with pro-Russian rebels has spurred

where it brings into question Ukraine&#8217;s ability to continue
paying its debt, Goldman analysts including Clemens Grafe wrote
in an e-mailed report. Past restructurings indicate bondholders
could lose half their principal, according to the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Sept. 5 truce is holding amid efforts to end a war the
United Nations estimates has claimed at least 3,000 lives. The
fighting in Ukraine&#8217;s Donetsk and Lugansk regions has destroyed
productive capacity, displaced a large share of the country&#8217;s
population and disrupted exports, prompting Goldman to raise
economic contraction estimates to 8 percent from 3 percent in
March and increase this year&#8217;s debt-to-GDP forecast to 70
percent from 55 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our current forecasts and the persisting uncertainty
surrounding the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine now raise
the question of whether the country can return to a sustainable
debt path without a restructuring,&#8221; the Goldman analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on Ukraine&#8217;s $2.6 billion of bonds due 2017 jumped
0.38 percentage points today to 12.84 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Bond trading indicate investors are
pricing in about a 15 percent chance of a restructuring within
the next year and 35 percent chance in the next five years, the
analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s work on a $700 million Arctic well in Russia could be stopped before it&#8217;s finished under new U.S. and European Union sanctions that outlaw the drilling partnership. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;New sanctions ban U.S. and EU companies from working with Russian officials or companies to find or produce crude from deep seas, shale fields or the Arctic. The decrees, reported earlier this week by Bloomberg, were imposed today, the 35th day of drilling at the 9 billion-barrel Universitetskaya prospect off Russia&#8217;s northern coast that was scheduled to last for 70 days. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;American and European explorers such as Exxon and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), which is drilling in Siberian shale rock formations, will have to act fast to avoid violating the bans, said Mark Herlach, an international lawyer and partner at the Sutherland Asbill Brennan LLP law firm in Washington. U.S. companies have until Sept. 26 to shut down sanctioned operations with Russian partners, according to the new rules. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Arctic Opportunity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The purpose of the sanctions is penalizing Russian interests for their actions in Ukraine, so there&#8217;s no policy reason to allow a delay,&#8221; Herlach said. &#8220;The high likelihood is that there is no grace period&#8221; for the oil companies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. and EU have been ratcheting up economic pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin to halt support for pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine since March. In an exclusive report Sept. 10, Bloomberg News spelled out the widest, hardest-hitting sanctions the EU and U.S. were preparing to impose. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Exxon &#8216;Assessing&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon, which began drilling the well last month as part of a $3.2 billion venture with Moscow-based OAO Rosneft (ROSN), declined to say whether it has begun transporting employees or contractors from the drilling project, or if it has plans in place to do so. &#8220;We are assessing the sanctions,&#8221; a spokesman said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) needs to find a
partner, secure natural gas contracts and assess engineering
costs before making a decision on its Canadian liquefied natural
gas project in Kitimat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron is continuing to work with aboriginal groups in the
area on the northwestern coast of British Columbia and doing
initial work on the site, said Chief Executive Officer John Watson, in a briefing in Calgary with reporters today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen pressure on LNG projects around the world,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;We have an advantaged resource in the Horn River
basin, but the costs are very high. You have to have good
alignment with partners.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron is one of a handful of companies considering
exporting natural gas from British Columbia. The Canadian
province is closer to Asian markets than some competing parts of
the world including the U.S. Gulf Coast, and demand for energy,
including LNG, continues to grow, Watson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, LNG projects &#8220;moving ahead&#8221; are those in
the Gulf Coast where existing infrastructure makes them easier 
to develop, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;None of the U.S. expansions of
the past 40 years died in bed of old age,&#8221; the late
Massachusetts Institute of Technology economics professor
Rudiger Dornbusch observed in 1997. &#8220;Every one was murdered by
the Federal Reserve.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As investors brace for interest-rate increases by the Fed
and the Bank of England, the message from Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. is that the economic recovery and animal spirits of
financial markets will abide in most major economies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank, which made $1.63 billion from its equities
division in the second quarter, bases its call on its analysis
of 33 interest-rate tightening cycles since the mid-1980s in
economies including the U.S., U.K. Germany and Canada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our bottom line is that a shift to higher yields need not
be a roadblock to ongoing economic and market progress,&#8221; Noah Weisberger, a New York-based economist, said in a report
published Sept. 10. &#8220;Markets may well be able to adjust to a
new rate regime without much loss of momentum.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis shows policy rates rise about 150 basis points
in a typical cycle, which lasts about 12 months. There&#8217;s another
four years or so before a subsequent recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annualized economic growth averages almost 4 percent in the
four quarters before the tightening and loses only about 20
basis points during the cycle before slowing to just over 2
percent in the subsequent year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Despite current concerns, historically, rate cycles seem
to leave economic growth largely intact at the outset, and, over
the longer term, tend to slow economic growth without disrupting
it,&#8221; according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Financial Markets &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for financial markets, 10-year yields move an average 40
basis points in the year leading up to the first rate increase
and equity markets grow an average 9 percent into the onset. In
the full year after the hikes begin, stocks post 12 percent
returns on average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given sluggish growth and labor-market slack in the U.S.
and Europe, central banks will be careful not to douse the
expansion when they do start raising, Weisberger said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Despite heightened worries about the market and economic
implications of the removal of monetary accommodation, our read
of the historical evidence is that such concerns are likely
misplaced and overdone, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying Minecraft would help
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella in his
drive to get the company&#8217;s software onto any mobile device --
even those made by competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since becoming CEO in February, Nadella has declared that
he wants to have Microsoft programs work across many gadgets, in
a break from having the company&#8217;s software running primarily on
hardware that uses its Windows operating system. In March,
Nadella said he would &#8220;hold nothing back&#8221; to achieve that
goal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Minecraft maker Mojang AB, Nadella would acquire not
only a popular game for Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox video-game business,
but also a hot property that works on Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPad, Sony
Corp.&#8217;s Playstation and phones based on Google Inc.&#8217;s Android.
Any deal, which would be Nadella&#8217;s first since taking over
Microsoft, would also underline the CEO&#8217;s commitment to Xbox.
While investors have long debated whether Microsoft should spin
off the consumer-oriented business, Nadella said in a
companywide memo in July that he would invest in the unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If there was any thought of Nadella wavering on Xbox, you
can throw that out the window,&#8221; said Daniel Ives, an analyst at
FBR Capital Markets  Co. &#8220;There is also a broader view on how
it fits with his strategy as part of cloud and mobile.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MD Medical Group Investments Plc,
which runs Russia&#8217;s largest chain of maternity centers, gained
for the first time in a week as JPMorgan Chase  Co. raised it
to buy, citing cheap valuation relative to regional peers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s recommendation on the company, which has a
market value of $620 million, comes as Aberdeen Asset Management
Plc sees Russian small-capitalization stocks as &#8220;ridiculously
cheap&#8221; after a sell-off. The MSCI Russia Small Cap Index is
down 22 percent this year, following a broad decline in the
country&#8217;s securities amid concern sanctions against Russia over
the Ukraine war will squelch economic growth. The U.S. and
European Union enforced new measures last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MD Medical gained 3.1 percent to $8.25 in London on Sept.
12, reducing its loss this year to 27 percent. Trading volume of
67,016 shares was 4.2 times the average of the past three
months. The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index rose 0.4 percent as
energy exporters including OAO Surgutneftegas and OAO Gazprom
Neft gained on speculation a weaker ruble will boost profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan cited the stock&#8217;s &#8220;compelling 30 percent
discount&#8221; to peers in eastern Europe and the Middle East when
it raised MD Medical from the equivalent of hold. Analyst Elena Jouronova forecast compound annual revenue growth of 26 percent
through 2017 as regional expansion gathers pace, according to an
e-mailed research note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;GDP Slowdown &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth in Russia&#8217;s $2 trillion economy has been slowed by
the international sanctions intended to punish President
Vladimir Putin for allegedly supporting the rebellion in eastern
Ukraine, a claim he denies. Barclays Plc., which projects a 0.1
percent decline in gross domestic product this year and a 0.6
percent contraction in 2015, said in a Sept. 11 research note
that new measures &#8220;imply downside risks&#8221; to that forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luis Saenz, head of equity sales and trading at BCS
Financial Group in London, said MD Medical isn&#8217;t as vulnerable
to the slowdown as other companies whose revenue comes from
domestic spending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They focus on high-end maternity health care and are
diversifying operations throughout Russia,&#8221; Saenz said by
phone. &#8220;Even as the economy slows, people won&#8217;t cut spending on
maternity health care because it&#8217;s so critical.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sales Estimates &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MD Medical, which has 17 medical centers throughout Russia
including in Moscow, St.Petersburg, Perm, Samara and Irkutsk,
said on Aug. 20 that it bought Avicenne Medical Center in
Novosibirk for $45.5 million. The acquisition will help the
company increase revenue, according to JP Morgan&#8217;s Jouronova and
Saenz of BCS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan raised MD Medical&#8217;s revenue forecast by as 4.6
percent to $204 million for 2014 and increased its 2015 sales
estimate by 5.6 percent to $265 million, according to the bank&#8217;s
research note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Their business model is beautiful, but low liquidity in
Russian small-capitalization stocks is a problem&#8221; Saenz said.
&#8220;Investors are worried about the geopolitical risks and want to
be able to get in and out of the market quickly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Micex Second-Tier Index of companies with lower market
capitalization fell 1 percent to 2,959.65 last week, extending
the decline this year to 4.9 percent. The benchmark Micex Index
dropped 1.1 percent last week to 1,458.52 and is down 3 percent
this year. The Bloomberg index of the most-trade Russian stocks
in the U.S. slid 3.3 percent to 85.46 in the five days through
Sept. 12 and has retreated 16 percent in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fund Flows &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Within the Russian space, the small-caps have sold off
ridiculously,&#8221; Peter Taylor, a senior investment manager for
global emerging markets at Aberdeen Asset Management in London,
said in an interview on Sept. 5. &#8220;Liquidity has completely
dried up. There are Russian small caps that are decent
businesses that are just looking ridiculously cheap.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MD Medical is a &#8220;nice business,&#8221; Taylor said. &#8220;The
management team impresses us and the business model is an
attractive structural story in Russia and yet that stock has
just gone so off year-to-date.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures (VEA) on the dollar-denominated RTS index expiring this
month gained 0.7 percent to 122,230 in U.S. hours on Sept. 12.
The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in the
futures, declined 1.2 percent to 32.19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX), the biggest U.S. exchange-traded fund that tracks the nation&#8217;s stocks, fell 3 percent last
week to $24.57. It gained 0.5 percent on Sept. 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia-dedicated funds attracted about $140 million in the
week through Sept. 10, after outflows in the previous week,
Cameron Brandt, research director at EPFR Global, a Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based company that tracks fund flows, said by e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conventional wisdom in Silicon Valley is that acquisitions are about gaining great talent. Just last week, Tim Cook told Charlie Rose that one of the main reasons Apple bought Beats was for "incredible talent." The Valley even has its own term for an acquisition based solely on hiring: "acquihire."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that's not why Microsoft is spending $2.5 billion for Mojang. The purveyor of all things Xbox is buying the Swedish developer for the mega-hit video game Minecraft. That's it. While Mojang says the "vast majority" of employees are expected to stick around until after the deal closes, the three founders are leaving right away. That includes Markus "Notch" Persson, the face of the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The headline on Microsoft's press release is telling: "Minecraft to join Microsoft." Not Mojang. Minecraft. That's a pragmatic way to describe the deal: Just about every kid and parent has heard of Minecraft, which has sold more than 54 million copies, comprising virtually all of the small studio's revenue. But Microsoft seems to indicate that this isn't about cultivating an eccentric group of independent-minded game designers; it's about Minecraft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft declined to comment on its acquisition strategy, referring us to a generic statement that reads: "Microsoft has acquired Mojang and the iconic Minecraft franchise. We&#8217;re honored to partner with them to carry Minecraft forward."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phil Spencer, the head of Xbox who led the Minecraft deal, seems to place a premium on franchises. He also helped broker Microsoft's purchase of the Gears of War franchise in January from Epic Games, a high-profile developer led by antagonistic creatives. In the announcement, Spencer noted that the shooter series "has a very strong, passionate and valued fan base on Xbox." They've bought 22 million copies of the Gears of War games, grossing more than $1 billion, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus on cultivating successful franchises, rather than brilliant but sometimes fickle visionaries, makes a lot of sense, says Billy Pidgeon, an independent consultant to the games industry. Video games are a lot like Hollywood, and a recognizable title goes a long way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's talent plays haven't always produced results. In 2002, the company bought Rare, the British studio behind some of the most beloved Nintendo games including Donkey Kong Country and GoldenEye 007. Rare didn't own most of the franchises it worked on, and it hasn't produced a major hit under Microsoft. Founders Tim and Chris Stamper left Microsoft in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bungie Software joined Microsoft in 2000, a year before releasing the first in its blockbuster Halo series. The developer created five Halo games until the relationship became untenable. Microsoft agreed in 2007 to spin off Bungie into an independent company, without Halo. Microsoft established its own development team devoted to Halo, and that group is creating a new version of Halo every year. Each one has been selling well. Meanwhile, Bungie teamed up with Activision to release Destiny on Sept. 9. That's already on track to be a massive franchise, generating $500 million in revenue in its first day available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Halo, Microsoft lists a series called Fable among its "global blockbuster franchises." That one came from the 2006 acquisition of Lionhead Studios. The company, also British, was started a decade earlier by Peter Molyneux, who's somewhat legendary in the gaming world for his innovative games, grand visions and over-promising. Molyneux, who has a lot of fans and critics, resigned in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The thing with games is it can be more volatile, and you're really dependent on the talent: You lose them, and you're in a bad place," says Pidgeon. "Franchises are always worthwhile. As long as you continue to keep the quality and continue to develop it in line with expectations, it can be really valuable. It's guaranteed to sell. As long as there are millions of people playing it, they'll continue to play it. The games business is very hit-driven."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), maker of the Xbox video-game console, agreed to acquire Mojang AB, the software company behind the popular game Minecraft, for $2.5 billion, in a bid to boost its Xbox and mobile businesses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker, said Stockholm-based Mojang will join its game-studio division, though the company&#8217;s founders will move on to other projects. The purchase is projected to close late this year, and will break even in fiscal 2015, Microsoft said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Buying Mojang would be the biggest deal struck since Satya Nadella took over as Microsoft&#8217;s chief executive officer in February, succeeding Steve Ballmer. The purchase gives Nadella a game that is popular across consoles, computers and mobile devices made by Microsoft and rivals like Apple Inc. It also bolsters a push to woo serious gamers back to Xbox after a lackluster attempt to turn the system into an all-in-one device that serves up broader content such as movies and music. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Acquiring the Minecraft game through the Mojang acquisition gives Mr. Nadella  Co. the right product at the right time as the company continues to invest in its Xbox strategy and begins its foray into the intensely competitive mobile-phone space with Nokia now under Microsoft&#8217;s hood and the restructuring plan under way,&#8221; Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets  Co., wrote in a note. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO)&#8217;s newest social-media campaign reaches back to a time when even MySpace didn&#8217;t exist. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Surge, a citrus-flavored Mountain Dew knockoff that was discontinued by Coke about 12 years ago, has reappeared in limited supply today. The only place to get it: Amazon.com. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Billed as the company&#8217;s first ever e-commerce reintroduction, the news was announced by the Facebook Fan site &#8220;Surge Movement,&#8221; whose 128,000 members lobbied for its return and paid for a billboard in Atlanta. Coke gave the drink a Twitter account, too, so loyalists can &#8220;follow the brand&#8217;s journey.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Surge is back,&#8221; the Facebook page&#8217;s organizers said, urging readers to buy and spread the word. &#8220;The Movement does not end here!&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the website listserv.com, Surge is listed as No. 7 on a Top 10 list of discontinued sodas, beating out Hubba Bubba Soda. Surge, a sweet and caffeinated green pop, will be sold in 12-packs of 16-ounce cans printed with the original graphics for $14. Coke said it may expand the drink to other retailers and add to the campaign, depending on how consumers react. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This will be a great learning experience for us and a refreshing opportunity for fans,&#8221; Wendy Clark, Coke&#8217;s president of North America Sparkling  Strategic Marketing, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scott Williamson, a Coke spokesman, declined to say how much of the drink the company has produced intially. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Extremely Rare&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola has struggled for decades to counter PepsiCo Inc. (PEP)&#8217;s Mountain Dew juggernaut. Surge was one of those efforts. Introduced in 1996, the last bottles and cans were offered in 2001, two years before the social-networking site Myspace debuted. Facebook would come even later. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the Surge Movement Facebook page, founded just before Christmas 2011, fans shared a 1997 commercial for the drink. Another post showed a way to get &#8220;extremely rare&#8221; Surge syrup on Ebay.com. One fan photo shows an artifact that was discovered at a flea market in Okoboji, Iowa: a giant Surge bottle once used at events to ice down drink samples. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I stole one of these when Surge first came out,&#8221; one commenter responded. &#8220;Sadly, it was lost at the top of Happy Jack Mountains outside of Laramie Wyoming when someone got in it and tried to ride it down a mountain. It was a prize possession.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The group sold &#8220;The Surge Movement&#8221; t-shirts, and it crowdfunded a $4,000 billboard near Coke headquarters in Atlanta that read: &#8220;Dear Coke, We couldn&#8217;t buy Surge so we bought this billboard instead.&#8221; It&#8217;s the largest to &#8220;pledge&#8221; for the revival of any discontinued product. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Mountain Dew &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The site&#8217;s managers urged fans to call Coca-Cola routinely with reminders like, &#8220;Did you make your call today?&#8221; A mysterious undated video posted yesterday showed the Facebook page&#8217;s administrators meeting at a hotel in Atlanta. Users wanted to know why but they weren&#8217;t saying. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s no wonder Coke keeps trying. Mountain Dew, the fourth-best-selling soft drink in the U.S., has been one of the few bright spots in PepsiCo&#8217;s soda lineup in recent years as consumers drink less soda. Popular with teens, video gamers and extreme sports enthusiasts, Mountain Dew outperformed both the soda category and Pepsi-Cola last year, according to Beverage Digest data. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Coke may have found its opening, though. Dew&#8217;s volume sales declined last year. Sales volume for regular Dew fell 2.2 percent, compared with declines of 3.6 percent for Pepsi-Cola and 3 percent for the category. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Duane D.

</body></entry><entry author="By Hugh Son" date="Sep 15, 2014 10:57 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-09-15/thomas-lee-starts-research-boutique-after-jpmorgan.html"><headline>Thomas Lee Starts Research Boutique After JPMorgan</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Lee, the former JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) chief equity strategist who spent 24 years at some
of Wall Street&#8217;s biggest firms, has started a seven-person
research boutique. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee, 45, left New York-based JPMorgan in March to start
Fundstrat Global Advisors with John Bai, former head of Asia and
U.S. equity sales at Mizuho Securities, according to a statement
today from the new company. Lee, who started at Kidder Peabody 
Co. in 1993 and worked at Salomon Smith Barney before joining
JPMorgan in 1999, will lead a research team of four, while Bai
oversees sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;ve had an itch for a long time to start my own thing,&#8221;
Lee said last week in a telephone interview. Covering the
wireless industry &#8220;from its infancy basically to its apex&#8221;
over 15 years instilled a desire to attempt to create something
of his own, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee deferred that wish while being the lead equity
strategist at the biggest U.S. bank since 2007, calling for
gains in American stocks for six straight years and getting them
in four. It was a &#8220;really rough road&#8221; being bullish at the
start of his tenure, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Everyone hated equities,&#8221; Lee said. &#8220;We turned it into
something people found a lot of value in, because people began
to trust us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More Accurate &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee was bullish at the start of each of six full years as
chief equity strategist, forecasting an average annual gain of
14 percent in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index (SPX) over the period.
He was more accurate than the average of strategist forecasts in
four of the six years, including 2012 and 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Fundstrat, Lee will combine an overview of markets,
similar to his work at JPMorgan, with calls on specific
industries and stocks, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a chance to produce a strategy product that would be
very difficult&#8221; at a big bank, he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s very difficult
when you&#8217;re at JPMorgan to have a view on a stock if the analyst
has a different view. We are freer to take much more contrarian
views at the stock level.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another strategist, Deutsche Bank AG&#8217;s John-Paul Smith, is
also leaving to start an independent-research firm. Smith, 53,
is forming Eclectic Strategy with Emad Mostaque, he said in an
e-mail. Smith was previously at Morgan Stanley, where he
correctly predicted Russia&#8217;s stock-market crash in 1998. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Client Partnerships &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smaller firms also allow a greater level of partnership
with clients who don&#8217;t have to worry that their trades or
strategy will be shared with thousands of other market
participants, Lee said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street banks are losing research market share to
smaller competitors, according to financial-services consulting
firm Greenwich Associates. Analysts departing big firms say they
can spend more time on research rather than meeting clients and
marketing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee remains optimistic on U.S. equities, which he says are
in the middle of a bull market that favors value stocks. He
predicts the SP 500, which closed last week at 1,986, will
climb 5.8 percent to 2,100 by year-end, up from a previous call
of 2,075. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market &#8220;creates an opportunity for those who can help
clients, because the average Wall Street firm isn&#8217;t providing
helpful guidance,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) charged New
York customers higher prices for Coca-Cola products than stated
in national circulars, running afoul of false advertising laws,
according to the state attorney general. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s biggest retailer charged $3.50 in New York
stores for 12-packs of the soft drinks instead of $3.00 as
advertised during promotions this year, New York Attorney
General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement yesterday. In one
instance, store staff falsely told a customer who complained
that the extra charge came from a &#8220;sugar tax,&#8221; Schneiderman
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There has to be one set of rules for everyone, no matter
how rich or how powerful, and that is why our office must ensure
that even the largest corporations cannot advertise one price
and then charge a higher one to New Yorkers,&#8221; Schneiderman
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under an agreement announced yesterday, the Bentonville,
Arkansas-based retailer will pay a $66,000 penalty and improve
practices to avert over-charging. The attorney general&#8217;s office
determined that cash registers weren&#8217;t programmed to recognize
the advertised price. Wal-Mart didn&#8217;t admit or deny the attorney
general&#8217;s findings, according to the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York law generally prohibits deceptive advertising,
including ads displaying false or misleading prices. Earlier
this year, Hobby Lobby Stores Inc. agreed to a $220,000
settlement with the state attorney general to resolve claims of
deceptively advertising prices by making it appear as though
consumers were receiving steep discounts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rahul Parekh became used to long hours and late nights at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in London, where he was executive director of equity-derivatives trading. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was the food that took its toll. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I remember when I was at Goldman Sachs, working late in the evening and nothing was open nearby,&#8221; he said in an interview. &#8220;You order online from one of the delivery businesses and can end up waiting 1-1/2 hours for a greasy takeaway that doesn&#8217;t feel healthy in any way.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It may have been more a microwave moment than a light-bulb idea but Parekh decided he could do better. He quit Goldman earlier this year and co-founded EatFirst, a food-delivery service that cooks its own fresh meals and promises to get them to your office in the City of London within 15 minutes of an order being placed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EatFirst follows an initial public offering in Just Eat Plc, an online takeaway service whose shares began trading in April. Just Eat was started in Denmark in 2001 and expanded into the U.K. in 2006. Just Eat Plc has a market value of 1.6 billion pounds ($2.6 billion). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just Eat connects customers with restaurants for takeaway meals. Unlike EatFirst, it doesn&#8217;t make or deliver the food. Other companies in the market include Deliveroo, which supplies foods from restaurants and charges for delivery. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Parekh&#8217;s partners are Humberto Ayres Pereira, who was at McKinsey  Co. and founded the Skin online cosmetics business in his native Portugal; and Torben Schulz, an entrepreneur who plans to start an EatFirst in Berlin, where he is based. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EatFirst is backed by Berlin-based Rocket Internet AG, which invests in companies related to the Internet industry. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Two Dishes &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company currently offers a choice of two dishes, one of them vegetarian. They both change daily and are prepared in a kitchen in Farringdon, near the City of London. Recent options include chorizo and chicken jambalaya; Thai massaman curry; and goat cheese ratatouille. Each costs 7 pounds ($11.32). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The executive chef is Jane Tran, who previously worked at Bar Boulud. A third option will be added in coming months. Customers may pay by debit or credit card or via an app. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Parekh, 28, was born in Manchester, England, to a family that was originally from Gujarat, in India. His parents were born in Kenya. EatFirst is initially delivering in part of the City of London financial district. It&#8217;s a crowded market. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;At Goldman, I used to cycle between Itsu on a Monday, and a Pret on a Tuesday, and a Leon on a Wednesday and a Pod on a Thursday and it just gets so boring after a couple of weeks,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s what we really wanted to change with EatFirst so people can have a varied diet and don&#8217;t have to look elsewhere.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Natalie Berg, global research director at Planet Retail Ltd. in London, said that while the trend toward healthy convenience food isn&#8217;t new, technology is changing things. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Working Lunch &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Food delivery has been limited to pizza and other fast food without high-quality options,&#8221; she said in a telephone interview. &#8220;But technology is changing this and there&#8217;s an opportunity to tap into a very lucrative working-lunch market. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;What is especially interesting with EatFirst is that it&#8217;s based on simplicity -- just a couple of dishes -- which helps them to keep costs down and reinforces the ethos of high-quality, freshly prepared food.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Parekh declined to disclose financial details or profit targets. He said the company plans to expand aggressively. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;In a place like London, which is so vast and so densely populated, the sky&#8217;s the limit,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Even the City, which is a tiny area, there&#8217;s almost 400,000 people during the day, so there&#8217;s no reason we can&#8217;t be pushing towards thousands a day and be the biggest food-delivery company in London. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Food Has Lagged &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;For the first year, I&#8217;d imagine within London we can get over 1,000 meals a day and that would be serving the City and central London and also expanding to Canary Wharf. We have a pretty aggressive expansion plan. We are working on a number of new kitchen locations and expanding our delivery network &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;I see this as the future for food delivery. As other retail products move online, food has really lagged. Our expansion plan is realistic given the future that we expect for the food industry and the online-delivery landscape.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most Britons ordering food online currently do so through a restaurant&#8217;s own website such as Pizza Hut, according to Helena Childe, senior food service analyst at Mintel. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Third-party sites such as Just Eat are increasing in popularity, she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Most online restaurant habits (from online ordering to mobile payments) are most common among Londoners and the tech-savvy youth market (under-35s),&#8221; Childe said in a Mintel report, &#8220;Eating Out: The Decision-Making Process,&#8221; earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Small Cog &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;EatFirst leases its kitchens and delivery bikes, seeking to keep down costs while it expands. Fair enough but was it wise to quit Goldman to pursue such a venture? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I had a fantastic experience at Goldman but everything we do now has a huge impact on the future of the business,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s different to working in an organization like Goldman Sachs, where you can feel like a small cog in a massive machine. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;This is a totally different thrill: There&#8217;s new things every day to do. I&#8217;ve been in the kitchen, cleaning dishes with the chefs. I&#8217;ve been handing out flyers with the marketing team. I&#8217;ve been involved in fund-raising meetings. There&#8217;s so much to do and it&#8217;s an all-round business experience.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Information: https://www.eatfirst.co.uk/; the app is here: https://itunes.apple.com/app/id907506298. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(Richard Vines is the chief food critic for Bloomberg.

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Markets are wrong,&#8221; Matias Silvani, a money manager at JPMorgan Asset Management, said at
an Emta conference in New York.
* Bond markets are &#8220;mispricing not only the timing of when this
is settled but the actual fundamentals, which have been
deteriorating.&#8221;
* When Argentina settles it will be done &#8220;in a position of
weakness, not strength.&#8221;
* Settlement with holdouts probably won&#8217;t happen before first
quarter of 2016, after there&#8217;s a new administration, Javier Kulesz, an analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc., said at the
conference. Three presidential candidates leading polls
understand cost of settling is low and upside is &#8220;phenomenal,&#8221;
he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s attempts to turn plants into alternative fuels for profitable, large-scale production have failed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The second-largest U.S. oil company by market value spent &#8220;significant sums&#8221; and assigned some of its best scientists to evaluate more than 100 kinds of feedstock and 50 techniques for converting them into fuels without success, Chevron Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Watson said during an address to the Economic Club of Minnesota in Minneapolis today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The smartest minds in my company and others haven&#8217;t yet cracked the code on pairing the right feedstock conversion technology and logistics in an economic and scalable package,&#8221; Watson said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Major crude producers from Chevron to BP Plc have been scaling back investment in renewables to focus on higher-profit ventures such as deep-water oil wells. Chevron&#8217;s setbacks echo those of Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), which last year said its $600 million foray into algae-based fuel may not succeed for another 25 years. BP put $3.1 billion of wind assets for sale last year after withdrawing from solar in 2011. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chevron sold an energy-efficiency unit last month that had been losing money for half a decade, Watson said. The company remains dedicated to other forms of renewables such as geothermal and continues to pursue research into some types of biofuels, Watson told reporters after his speech. Chevron&#8217;s plants research focused on non-food crops, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) is marketing its Watson analytics technology to rank-and-file workers across a swath of industries as it seeks to
encourage broader adoption of cloud-based data products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is making available a standard version of its
data-crunching service, first unveiled in January, as a product
for clients like banks and pharmaceutical companies. The
software will be offered in a basic free format, with paid
features such as additional storage or connecting different
sources of data, said Alistair Rennie, IBM&#8217;s general manager of
business analytics, in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has been trying to commercialize its Watson tool, which
lets users ask questions in plain English language and analyze
data for patterns, by showing how it can be used for tasks such
as customer service and cooking. The company has been investing
in analytics software like Watson, famous for winning the
&#8220;Jeopardy!&#8221; TV show, amid a slump in demand for hardware that
has led to nine straight quarters of falling sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Outreach to the individual through digital methods is a
critical element to getting these tools to as many people as

&lt;p&gt;Even with Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sounding the all-clear, Stephen Jen is inclined to stay in the bunker. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The co-founder of London-based hedge fund SLJ Macro Partners LLC and former chief currency strategist at Morgan Stanley is pushing back against research by economists at his one-time employer and Goldman Sachs that the U.S. and global economic expansions have long to run. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t find their argument persuasive at all,&#8221; Jen wrote in a Sept. 9 note to clients. &#8220;I see the probability of recessions being higher, not lower.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His reasoning is that the U.S. and other developed countries still have yet to fully recover from the financial crisis and recession that accelerated with the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., six years ago yesterday. Government debt, for example, has ballooned, leaving economies less secure than in previous expansions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The weak recovery is another reason for Jen to worry. He says it leaves economies prone to small shocks that could tip them into another contraction. The euro area stalled in the second quarter, while a harsh winter was enough for the U.S. to shrink in the first -- leaving the return to historically normal interest rates an unpredictable force. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Easy Money &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley said in a Sept. 2 report that a prolonged period of deleveraging in the U.S., alongside global growth, could mean the current five-year-old expansion lasts to 2020. It last week extended its analysis to the world economy, saying it could grow another five years amid easy money. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Making a similar argument, Kris Dawsey of Goldman Sachs said in a report last month that most economic indicators and asset markets suggest the U.S. expansion is not at a late stage. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jen says the financial crisis changed how economies work, limiting the value of comparisons with past business cycles. He notes Japan had six recessions and contracted 37 percent of the quarters since its own asset bubbles burst in 1989-1990. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are so many features of the macro economy that have been strange and different since the global financial crisis of 2008,&#8221; said Jen. &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure one can be too confident about drawing lessons from the pre-crisis period.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Simon Kennedy in Paris at skennedy4@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editors responsible for this story: James Hertling at jhertling@bloomberg.net Zoe Schneeweiss &lt;/p&gt;

finance business in Switzerland, amid a rise in investment
banking activity in the country. &lt;/p&gt;

capital markets funding and mergers and acquisitions

124.5 billion euros ($161.1 billion) of deals agreed, including
the 37.5 billion euro merger of Lafarge SA with Jona,

&lt;p&gt;Under an agreement announced yesterday, the Bentonville,
Arkansas-based retailer will pay a $66,000 penalty and improve
practices to avert over-charging. The attorney general&#8217;s office
determined that cash registers weren&#8217;t programmed to recognize
the advertised price. Wal-Mart didn&#8217;t admit or deny the attorney
general&#8217;s findings, according to the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York law generally prohibits deceptive advertising,
including ads displaying false or misleading prices. Earlier
this year, Hobby Lobby Stores Inc. agreed to a $220,000
settlement with the state attorney general to resolve claims of
deceptively advertising prices by making it appear as though
consumers were receiving steep discounts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iron ore&#8217;s slump to a five-year low
isn&#8217;t expected to prevent the world&#8217;s two biggest miners, BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP) and Rio Tinto Group (RIO), returning cash to investors,
a JPMorgan Chase  Co. fund manager said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You have to remember the very large operating margins
which can still be achieved within iron ore,&#8221; James Sutton, a
portfolio manager at JPMorgan&#8217;s $1.6 billion Natural Resources
Fund in London, said in an interview. There&#8217;s &#8220;a lot of scope
for shareholder returns,&#8221; as Rio and BHP are curbing investment
in marginal projects, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The steel-making ingredient slumped to the lowest in five
years this month prompting Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to declare
the &#8220;end of the Iron Age&#8221; after a Chinese-led demand spike
over the last decade prompted record profits for BHP and Rio. As
investors demand a greater share of mining industry profits, the
largest iron ore producers are flooding the market with new
supply, trimming prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Looking at the bigger picture, I think that the two
things are not incompatible,&#8221; Sutton said. &#8220;These businesses
will have to get used to a lower iron ore price environment.
They may become more boring as a result and focus on those core
assets and focus on getting more and more margin out of them.
That will ultimately lead to higher dividends and buybacks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan Natural Resources fund has Rio as its fourth-largest holding, with a 4.7 percent weighting, and BHP as it the
sixth at 4.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year&#8217;s 37 percent decline in iron ore was partly
responsible for BHP shying away from a widely anticipated
buyback last month, chief executive officer of the world&#8217;s
biggest mining company Andrew Mackenzie said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disappoint Again &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We fear the group could again disappoint (excessively
high) market expectations on capital return next year,&#8221; if
prices for iron ore and copper fail to rebound sharply, Exane
BNP Paribas analysts led by Luc Pez wrote in a report this week
in which BHP was downgraded to underperform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rio Tinto CEO Sam Walsh, who derives almost 90 percent of
the London-based company&#8217;s earnings from the iron ore division,
last month described the world&#8217;s second-biggest iron ore
exporter as a &#8220;cash machine&#8221; as a cost-cutting drive starts to
bear fruit. The company has a vision to &#8220;deliver on increased
shareholder returns,&#8221; he said in an Aug. 8 interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chinese Port &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron ore with 62 percent content at the Chinese port of
Tianjin fell 0.8 percent yesterday to $84.50 a dry ton,
according to The Steel Index. Prices retreated to $81.90 a ton
on Sept. 11, the lowest level since September 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At current prices we think they will announce a
significant dividend increase and a buyback,&#8221; said Rob
Clifford, a London-based analyst at Deutsche Bank AG, who rates
Rio Tinto a buy. &#8220;I&#8217;m convinced that today&#8217;s iron ore price
remains above both BHP and Rio&#8217;s internal view of what long term
prices are ,so as far as they&#8217;re concerned they&#8217;re still making
excess margins on iron ore.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the price may find a floor near $80 a ton as lower
cost Australian supplies displace higher cost Chinese
production, according to JPMorgan&#8217;s Sutton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hit a Floor &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are seeing increasing signs of production falling off
in China and other parts of the world as well being displaced by
this very low cost Australian production which is coming on
stream ahead of time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We might be starting to hit a
floor.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mine closures around the world spurred by the slump in
prices will help the price to level out, according to the
government forecaster in Australia, the world&#8217;s biggest
exporter. It may average $90 a ton to $95 a ton over the next
five years, according to Wayne Calder, deputy executive director
at the Canberra-based Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expanding global glut will more than triple to 163
million tons next year from 52 million this year, according to
Goldman. The surplus is seen expanding to 245 million tons in
2016, 295 million tons in 2017 and 334 million tons in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies in Brazil are shunning
the local bond market on speculation President Dilma Rousseff,
who&#8217;s presided over an economy plagued by surging inflation and
a lack of growth, will be re-elected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate borrowers have issued 35.44 billion reais ($15.24
billion) of bonds in the first eight months of the year, a 7.8
percent decrease from a year ago and the least since 2010,
according to the most recent data from Anbima, Brazil&#8217;s capital
markets association. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the first round of elections less than three weeks
away, polls show Rousseff is regaining the popular support she
lost earlier this month. That&#8217;s revived concern a victory by the
incumbent will mean four more years of fiscal policies that led
to Brazil&#8217;s first recession since 2009, which may deter
companies from borrowing to expand, according to JPMorgan Chase
 Co. and Banco Votorantim SA. This month, companies have issued
2 billion reais of bonds, less than half as much as a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies are waiting &#8220;until there is more clarity on what
the next government will be like,&#8221; Ricardo Leoni, the head of
Brazil&#8217;s debt capital markets at JPMorgan, said in a telephone
interview from Sao Paulo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials from the president&#8217;s office didn&#8217;t reply to e-mails and a call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming Rousseff is one of the top finishers in first-round voting on Oct. 5, she would then probably garner 41
percent of the vote in an Oct. 26 election runoff, according to
a Vox Populi poll released Sept. 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dead Heat &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That puts her in a statistical tie with opposition
candidate Marina Silva, who received support from 42 percent of
those polled. The Sept. 13-14 survey of 2,000 people has a
margin of error of 2.2 percentage points. Silva&#8217;s lead was seven
percentage points in an Aug. 31-Sept. 2 poll. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Ibope poll published yesterday showed a runoff between
Rousseff and Marina Silva would be too close to call while
backing for third-place candidate Aecio Neves increased.
Rousseff would win 36 percent of voter support in the first
round, with 30 percent for Silva and 19 percent for Neves,
according to the Sept. 13-15 survey. In an Oct. 26 runoff, Silva
would have 43 percent of voter support, compared with 40 percent
for Rousseff, according to the poll published on Jornal Nacional
television. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past three weeks, Rousseff has stepped up attacks
against Silva, saying the former environment minister doesn&#8217;t
have the experience to lead and would reduce investments in
offshore oil and gas reserves. Silva says the incumbent&#8217;s
policies contributed to a recession in the first half of this
year and quicker inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Government&#8217;s Role &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since taking office in January 2011, Rousseff has increased
the government&#8217;s role in companies, changing concession-renewal
rules to lower electricity rates and capping gasoline prices to
tame inflation that last month exceed the 6.5 percent limit of
the central bank&#8217;s target range. Policy makers raised the
benchmark interest rate by 3.75 percentage points over nine
straight meetings through April before holding it at a two-year
high of 11 percent for the past three. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Latin America&#8217;s largest economy shrank 0.6 percent in the
April-June period from the previous three months, after
contracting 0.2 percent in the first quarter, the national
statistics agency said Aug. 29. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real declined 0.3 percent to 2.3388 per dollar today as
of 2:40 p.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Average Rates &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silva has promised to cut inflation by half and called for
a fiscal-responsibility body to independently monitor budgets
and spending to verify that the government is complying with
fiscal targets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average interest rate on floating-rate local bonds with
maturities longer than 12 months issued this year was 10.99
percent, 0.12 percentage point above the average in the same
span last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This has been a tough year for local companies, with all
the concerns regarding politics and the economic scenario we&#8217;ll
have starting next year,&#8221;Carolina Lacerda, the head of
investment banking at UBS AG&#8217;s Brazil unit and a director at
Anbima, said in an interview in Sao Paulo. &#8220;Companies are
cautious, especially because the cost of funding, in general, is
at a very high level.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Brazilian companies are staying away from the local
debt market, they&#8217;re boosting overseas offerings to lock in
borrowing costs before U.S. policy makers raise interest rates.
They have issued $42.7 billion this year, a 45 percent increase
from the same period in 2013, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Growth Outlook &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ricardo Carvalho, an analyst at Fitch Ratings, said that if
economic growth begins to recover later this year, issuance in
the local market will probably rebound. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian companies aren&#8217;t selling bonds &#8220;because they are
not spending much,&#8221; he said in an interview in Sao Paulo.
&#8220;That could change once the economy starts to improve, which
could happen before the end of this semester.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Carvalho sees the potential for growth to accelerate,
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service cut the outlook on Brazil&#8217;s credit
rating to negative on Sept. 9, saying the economy is unlikely to
rebound in the short term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Companies seem to be waiting for what will happen in the
macroeconomic scenario and after elections before selling more
debt,&#8221; Reinaldo Lacerda, who helps manage 43 billion reais in
assets as the investment director at the wealth management
division of Banco Votorantim SA, said in an interview in Sao
Paulo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese purchases of Hong Kong
stocks through a planned exchange link may exceed estimates as
individual investors buy casino and technology shares
unavailable in Shanghai, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The link will give wealthy mainland investors access to 266
stocks traded in Hong Kong, including Galaxy Entertainment Group
Ltd. (27) and Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700) China currently limits most
overseas share investments to those made through asset managers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We might be surprised by retail participation once the
stock connect is launched, given mainland investors&#8217; preference
to invest and trade themselves instead of buying mutual funds,&#8221;
Christina Ma, the head of Goldman&#8217;s cash trading, equities in
Asia Pacific ex-Japan, said in an interview in Hong Kong on
Sept. 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s view follows a CLSA Ltd. survey last month
showing 77 percent of mainland investors don&#8217;t plan to
participate in the bourse link, turned off by rules on the
minimum account size and the exclusion of small-cap stocks.
China, the biggest emerging economy, is counting on a successful
exchange link to help liberalize its financial system, increase
the role of the yuan and give its citizens more investment
channels amid a slumping property market and increased risks
from local wealth-management products. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s Brazil
unit returned to profitability in the fourth quarter as the
departure of several managing directors helped cut costs and
fixed-income gains offset an investment-banking revenue drop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We made the right decision in anticipating that this year
would be less vibrant for investment banking, and had some
opportunities for cost reductions when some executives left
after receiving good job offers,&#8221; Paulo Leme, named Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s president and chief executive officer for Brazil today,
said in an interview in Sao Paulo. Leme, 59, didn&#8217;t say how long
the New York-based company had been losing money in Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs eliminated bonuses for some bankers in Brazil
this year, contributing to the departures of five executives in
January, people familiar with the matter said in February. The
company reduced employees in investment banking to 25 from 45,
the people said. Fabio Bicudo, the former co-head of investment
banking, left in January to become CEO of Rio de Janeiro-based
power company Eneva SA, Leme said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs began trading Brazil Treasury bonds in the
second half of last year, &#8220;and now we are the most active bank
in the primary market and one of the top four in the secondary
market, competing head-to-head with local players,&#8221; Alejandro Vollbrechthausen, whom Leme is replacing, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vollbrechthausen will move to New York after Leme&#8217;s
appointment is approved by Brazil&#8217;s central bank, to become
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s head of fixed-income, currencies and commodities
sales for Latin America. Leme was previously chairman for
Brazil, a position that will be eliminated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Private Equity &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drag from lower investment-banking revenue is also
being offset by gains in private equity, structured credit,
mezzanine financing and non-performing loan acquisitions, said
Vollbrechthausen, who is a Goldman Sachs partner, a nod to the
firm&#8217;s history as a private partnership before going public in
1999. Leme is a managing director, one level below partner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With about 300 employees in Brazil, about the same as the
level at the start of last year, the bank is &#8220;well-staffed&#8221;
for now, Leme said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least nine managing directors in Brazil left Goldman
Sachs during 2013 after the bank halted its growth plans when
the economy expanded less than analysts estimated. Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s revenue from investment banking had been falling in
Brazil while trading and wealth-management fees increased,
people familiar with the matter said last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is firing 2,100

18,000 jobs to streamline the workforce and integrate the
acquisition of Nokia Oyj&#8217;s handset unit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) fell after a
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst said the company may need at
least $6 billion in capital, most of it over the next 11 years,
if its electric car becomes a &#8220;disruptive&#8221; product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The automaker led by Elon Musk is targeting production of
100,000 premium electric cars by late next year and has an
eventual goal to sell at least 500,000 cars annually. The
capital may be needed to fund growth if Tesla&#8217;s vehicles prove
to be as popular as Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPhone or Ford Motor Co.&#8217;s
Model T. Under such scenarios, production would range from 1.8
million a year to 3.2 million a year by 2025, Patrick Archambault, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, wrote today in a note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With numerous projects laid out (as well as those not
currently communicated) ahead for Tesla, we see a possible need
for additional capital,&#8221; he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla also is building a battery factory to provide cheaper
lithium-ion cells for its vehicles. It said the facility may
cost as much as $5 billion. In March, the company raised about
$2.3 billion toward the plant, which is being built near Reno,
Nevada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archambault, who has a neutral rating on Palo Alto,
California-based Tesla, said the bulk of his estimate for the
company&#8217;s capital needs would be for 2017 through 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla hasn&#8217;t given a forecast for capital spending, Simon Sproule, a spokesman, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock fell 1.7 percent to $259.32 at the close in New
York. The shares have risen 72 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Tesla said today it released a software update
for its Model S. New features include traffic-based navigation,
commute advice, remote starting and the ability to give your car
a nickname, according to a statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) said the U.S. government is giving the company more time to shut its Russian Arctic well beyond the deadline for sanctions aimed at halting the $700 million project. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon asked Washington for an extension to allow it to continue performing shut-down work on the Universitetskaya-1 (University-1) well in Russia&#8217;s Kara Sea to make sure the well was safe before it&#8217;s temporarily abandoned. The Irving, Texas-based company already had ceased drilling the offshore well after U.S. sanctions set a Sept. 26 deadline for ending the work. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The U.S. Treasury Department, recognizing the complexity of the University-1 well and the sensitive Kara Sea arctic environment, has granted a license to Exxon Mobil and other U.S. contractors and persons involved to enable the safe and responsible winding down of operations related to this exploration well,&#8221; Exxon said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The most-recent round of sanctions intended to punish Russia for its involvement in separatist violence in Ukraine barred U.S. and European Union companies from helping Russia exploit oil resources in the Arctic, deep seas and shale formations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Waging Financial War&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measures had prompted Exxon and its partner OAO Rosneft (ROSN) to temporarily halt drilling at the well, which lies about 260 feet (79 meters) beneath the sea surface off Siberia&#8217;s northern coast, according to three people familiar with the project. The well is aiming to tap a resource estimated to hold as much as 9 billion barrels of crude, worth $880 billion at current prices. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;More Time &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon sought the exemption from the deadline after engineers involved in the project warned they needed more time to properly plug the well with cement and conduct tests to ensure there are no leaks, cracks or faults that could damage the reservoir or allow environmental contamination, according to a source with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon and Rosneft are exploring a geologic formation never before drilled by humans, which means the pressure changes, layer densities and temperatures at various depths are unknown, increasing the risks of unexpected collapses or pressure bursts. For that reason, the engineers closing the well need to map the formation a foot at a time as they back out of the well, a process that can take weeks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Slowing Progress &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The halt at Universitetskaya-1 is a blow to Russian President Vladimir Putin&#8217;s quest to find a new generation of oil fields to replace declining output from some of the country&#8217;s Soviet-era reserves. The Russian oil industry is dependent on expertise and equipment from the U.S. and Europe to penetrate crude reservoirs that are deeper, denser and more remote than anything they&#8217;ve attempted before. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The disruption also is a setback for Exxon as the company seeks to lift production that touched a 4-year low in 2013 as the rate it&#8217;s replacing output with new discoveries tumbled to the lowest in half a decade. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s $3.2 billion exploration pact with Moscow-based Rosneft is a linchpin of the U.S. company&#8217;s bid to spur production and reserves growth in the next decade, said Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones  Co. in St. Louis. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Enormous&#8217; Potential &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Arctic drilling potential for Exxon is really enormous,&#8221; said Youngberg, who has a hold rating on Exxon shares. &#8220;It&#8217;s one of the key growth areas they&#8217;re looking to post-2020.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rosneft&#8217;s press office in Moscow declined to comment. Hagar Chemali, a U.S. Treasury Department spokesperson, declined to comment and referred a Bloomberg News inquiry to Exxon. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon is using the West Alpha rig owned by Seadrill Ltd. (SDRL)&#8217;s North Atlantic (NADL) Drilling unit at the Universitetskaya-1 site about 70 miles offshore. The rig departed a Norwegian shipyard in July and sailed around the northern coast of Scandinavia and into Russian territory right before the U.S. and EU prohibited exports of gear for Arctic, deep-water and shale drilling. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Within weeks, the U.S. and EU moved to close loopholes in the sanctions by also banning the export of services such as engineering expertise and geological analysis for Russian Arctic, deep-water and shale projects. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon rose 0.5 percent to $97.12 at the close of trading in New York. Seadrill fell 4.1 percent today in Oslo to its lowest closing price since November 2011. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The measures left untouched so-called conventional oil developments that aren&#8217;t part of Putin&#8217;s hunt for next-generation oilfields, including the Sakhalin-1 development off Russia&#8217;s Pacific Coast managed by Exxon and Rosneft. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Joe Carroll in Chicago at jcarroll8@bloomberg.net; Alan Katz in Washington at akatz5@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editors responsible for this story: Susan Warren at susanwarren@bloomberg.net Tina Davis &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the world&#8217;s third-largest oil producer by market value, is seeking a buyer for one
of its smallest refineries, the Kapolei plant on the Hawaiian
island of Oahu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale of the the 54,000-barrel-a-day Kapolei complex is
part of a larger plan to divest $10 billion worth of assets over
the next three years. Closing the plant would leave Hawaii with
a single 93,500-barrel-a-day refinery, which Par Petroleum Corp. (PARR)
bought from Tesoro Corp. (TSO) last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron shares were up $1.03, or 0.8 percent, at $125.17 at
2:42 p.m. New York time. Par Petroleum Corp., which operates the
only other plant in Hawaii, gained 6 percent to $16.58. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron &#8220;has decided to engage an investment banking firm
to identify potential parties interested in the purchase of our
assets in Hawaii,&#8221; Braden Reddall, a spokesman at Chevron&#8217;s
headquarters in San Ramon, California, said by telephone late
yesterday. &#8220;No decision has been made at this time other than
to determine the level of interest of potential buyers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank has been hired by Chevron, two people with
direct knowledge of the situation said, while asking not to be
identified because the information isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Al Chee, a Chevron spokesman at the refinery, declined by
telephone to comment. Ari Cohen, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank
in New York, declined by e-mail to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fourth-Smallest &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron previously considered turning the Kapolei complex
into a terminal. After a review three years ago, the company
decided to continue to run it as a refinery. It&#8217;s Chevron&#8217;s
fourth-smallest by capacity, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selling the refinery in 2011 was &#8220;not as competitive&#8221; as
improving its value, Michael Wirth, Chevron&#8217;s executive vice
president of downstream and chemicals, said in a conference call
with analysts at the time of the review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Everybody realizes that&#8217;s a small refinery,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;It&#8217;s not an especially complex refinery. It&#8217;s got a somewhat
isolated and finite market. And so we&#8217;re really in the space of
optimizing every dimension of performance there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery ran 39,000 barrels a day in 2013, down from
46,000 in 2012, the company said in its 10-K annual report. Last
year, the plant imported 87 percent of its oil from Indonesia,
Thailand and Vietnam, Energy Information Administration data
show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Chevron extended a supply contract with
Hawaiian Electric Co. Inc. for low-sulfur fuel. Meanwhile, Par
Petroleum said it was losing its contracts with the utility in
December and was &#8220;aggressively pursuing other outlets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc are the two
largest oil producers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Citigroup Inc. (C) announced a plan to fire thousands of workers and scale back international operations in December 2012, it looked like one more piece of bad news for the big bank, which went on to fail its second consecutive U.S. Federal Reserve stress test. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group (GS) Inc. analyst Richard Ramsden didn&#8217;t see it that way. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Jan. 3, Ramsden lifted his rating on the New York&#8211;based bank to what Goldman calls a conviction buy, even though the shares were near a 17-week high and some analysts thought they were poised for a downturn, Bloomberg Markets magazine will report in its October issue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The strategy we had going into 2013 was to look for restructuring stories that we felt were mispriced, and Citigroup was one,&#8221; Ramsden says. &#8220;We felt that the stronger banks had already done a pretty good job reducing funding costs and expenses and had less room to grow earnings.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related: The Dumb Money Is Getting Smarter Every Day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup&#8217;s shares surged 26 percent in the 11 months following his call, beating the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. Ramsden&#8217;s confidence in Citi didn&#8217;t last out the year. On Dec. 3, he cut the rating to a hold and assigned a strong buy rating to U.S. Bancorp. (USB) He was right again. Citigroup slipped 8.5 percent through the end of the first quarter of 2014, while U.S. Bancorp climbed 9.9 percent over the period. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Garry Cipponeri, the head of
capital markets for JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s U.S. mortgage unit,
is leaving the bank to start a new company, according to two
people with knowledge of the move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cipponeri, a senior vice president who joined JPMorgan in
2004 from Citigroup Inc., is planning to start a firm called
TradeRoom Capital Partners that will trade mortgages that
haven&#8217;t been packaged into bonds and do consulting, said the
people, who asked not to be named because the decision hasn&#8217;t
been announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He declined to comment when reached by telephone, as did
Jason Lobo, a spokesman for the New York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the second-largest U.S. home lender after Wells
Fargo  Co., according to newsletter Inside Mortgage Finance.
Cipponeri often represented the bank during panels at industry
events, such as a Mortgage Bankers Association conference in New
York in May and a workshop sponsored by the Federal Reserve
Banks of Boston and New York in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) fell to the
lowest level in six weeks after a JPMorgan Chase  Co. analyst
projected a share price of less than $200, suggesting fewer
vehicle sales than are implied by battery-factory plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares fell 3.6 percent to $250.03 at the close in New
York, the lowest price since Aug. 8. The stock has risen 66
percent this year, outpacing a 7.7 percent gain by the Russell
1000 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company led by Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk is
targeting an annualized production rate of 100,000 premium
electric cars by the end of 2015. Palo Alto, California-based
Tesla may produce only 18,250 sedans and sport-utility vehicles
in next year&#8217;s fourth quarter for a run-rate of 73,000, Ryan
Brinkman, an auto-industry analyst with JPMorgan, said in an e-mail to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the automaker has indicated with its plan to build a
massive battery factory that it aims to produce 500,000 vehicles
a year, JPMorgan projected 303,500 cars assembled in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla is building a factory near Reno, Nevada, to provide
cheaper lithium-ion cells for its vehicles. The plant may cost
as much as $5 billion, Tesla said. The company raised about $2.3
billion toward the plant in March. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. said one
of its trading units fell under the U.K.&#8217;s Financial Conduct
Authority for the first time as it seeks to expand services in
European financial commodity markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercuria Europe Trading Ltd. is authorized and regulated by
the FCA under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, the
Geneva-based company said today in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercuria, nearing completion of a $3.5 billion deal to buy
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s physical commodity operation, joins
Glencore Plc and Trafigura Beheer BV in having part of its
business regulated by the FCA. After decades of operating in
relative secrecy, the acquisition of physical assets is pushing
independent commodity traders to increase disclosure as they
seek new sources of financing, including bond sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As Mercuria&#8217;s business model continues to evolve to
expand its provision of services, so too does the regulatory
oversight of Mercuria,&#8221; Victoria Attwood Scott, the firm&#8217;s head
of compliance, said today in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attwood Scott, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) executive,
said in April that Mercuria was in discussions with the FCA to
determine whether the purchase of JPMorgan&#8217;s European gas and
power operations would require regulatory oversight by the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Growing Fast &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded a decade ago by former Goldman Sachs traders Marco Dunand and Daniel Jaeggi, Mercuria is growing faster than
Trafigura, Gunvor Group Ltd. and Vitol Group, the world&#8217;s
largest oil trader. As investment banks such as JPMorgan pull
back from physical commodities because of rising regulatory
scrutiny, Mercuria is seeking to combine such operations with
investment bank-style commodity futures and options trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercuria&#8217;s FCA application isn&#8217;t the first by a foreign-based commodity trading firm. A unit of Baar, Switzerland-based
Glencore Plc (GLEN) is regulated by the FCA as is the Galena Asset
Management Ltd. hedge fund arm of Amsterdam&#8217;s Trafigura, and
energy and metals trading firms related to Wichita, Kansas-based
Koch Industries Inc, according to the FCA website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FCA in February issued its first report on commodity-market regulation in the U.K. since 2007. The study raised
concerns about the increasing role in global markets played by
commodity trading houses and the ability to adequately regulate
them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-governmental organizations like Switzerland&#8217;s Berne
Declaration have said there is a gap in regulatory oversight in
relation to traders like Mercuria, which recorded revenue of
$112 billion in 2013. The firm and other traders have said their
businesses are already subject to regulation through exchange-traded options trading and oversight of their banking partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mercuria has always been subject to regulations and
oversight across the globe in all of its activities and takes
these responsibilities very seriously,&#8221; Attwood Scott said in
the statement. &#8220;As such, Mercuria views this development as an
extension of its existing obligations and regulatory
relationships as we broaden the scope of our business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. banks will probably wait to see if issuing Shariah-compliant bonds is worth the trouble after it took Goldman Sachs Group Inc. three years to sell its debut sukuk. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Islamic finance in the U.S. is still underdeveloped, and misconceptions associated with it taint the industry, according to King  Spalding LLP, an adviser on Shariah transactions in the country for 35 years. HSBC Holdings Plc, the biggest underwriter of sukuk this year after Malaysia&#8217;s CIMB Group Holdings Bhd., says the need for tangible assets to structure deals, and the lack of legislation to address taxation issues, makes selling Islamic bonds a challenge. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s highly likely that Goldman will be the sole player in the Islamic finance market in any meaningful way for the near term,&#8221; George Thomas Conboy, chairman of Rochester, New York-based Brighton Securities Corp., a financial services company, said by phone from Istanbul on Sept. 18. &#8220;There aren&#8217;t as many players willing to take risks in that area until Goldman blazes a trail and it&#8217;s clear that Islamic finance can be properly structured and profitable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest bank in the U.S., sold its debut sukuk last week, three years after its first foray into Islamic capital markets ended with controversy over the debt&#8217;s structure. It&#8217;s the fourth U.S.-based issuer to sell the securities. Borrowers raised $2 trillion from all bond sales in America last year, more than 46 times the amount sold in the Shariah market and more than the value of Islamic financial assets globally. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Negative Perception &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hong Kong, the U.K., South Africa and Sharjah, one of seven sheikhdoms in the United Arab Emirates, are among borrowers that have sold Islamic bonds for the first time this year. New York-based Goldman Sachs&#8217;s five-year notes yielded 21 basis points more than similar maturity non-Shariah compliant debt it issued in January at 3:21 p.m. in Dubai. The bank attracted orders for three times the $500 million it sold. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Islamic finance&#8217;s level of awareness and depth of knowhow in general in the U.S. is at best at its infancy, with negative connotations stemming misconceptions,&#8221; Rizwan Kanji, a Dubai-based partner at King  Spalding, said by telephone from Dubai Sept. 18. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Islam is the most negatively perceived religion in the U.S., followed by atheism, according to a study by the Washington-based Pew Research Center published in July. About 1.9 million Muslims live in the country, the seventh-biggest religious group among about 319 million people, according to CIA World Factbook data. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Risk Premium &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Goldman Sachs&#8217;s sukuk won&#8217;t &#8220;create a market of new issuers in the U.S., frequent conventional issuers will start to see sukuk as a new avenue for tighter pricing or diversification of their investor base,&#8221; Kanji said. Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. were among the biggest issuers of debt last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rob Julavits, a spokesman for Citigroup, Zia Ahmed from Bank of America and Jessica Francisco from JPMorgan declined to comment last week on whether the lenders will be pursuing Islamic financing deals. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Stamp Duties &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Borrowers using sukuk need assets to underlie the debt and there&#8217;s an additional cost of hiring Shariah scholars or boards to structure the securities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you&#8217;re a U.S. corporate that doesn&#8217;t have tangible assets it can utilize, it&#8217;s more challenging to structure&#8221; a sukuk, Mohammed Dawood, HSBC&#8217;s Dubai-based global head of sukuk financing, said in a Sept. 11 interview. &#8220;The U.S. hasn&#8217;t passed sukuk-specific legislation, unlike Hong Kong and the U.K., which have passed legislation to address tax and legal impediments.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To adhere to Islam&#8217;s ban on interest, the bonds pay a return on assets and may attract double charges on stamp duties because of the sale and purchase of goods to back the debt. Profits or capital gains incur taxes, whereas interest is tax deductible. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Islamic finance is too new for U.S.-based issuers, and the structures and impediments are too complicated, Conboy said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Anything with Shariah attached to it carries a small risk premium,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Dana El Baltaji in Dubai at delbaltaji@bloomberg.net; Daria Solovieva in Dubai at dsolovieva1@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editors responsible for this story: Samuel Potter at spotter33@bloomberg.net Claudia Maedler &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds may drive initial
demand for Shanghai-listed stocks through a linkage of the
city&#8217;s bourse with that in Hong Kong, which opens up a new route
for foreign investors to buy Chinese shares, according to
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The link will tap into pent-up demand from hedge funds to
buy yuan-denominated class-A shares traded in Shanghai, said
Shane Bolton, head of Asia prime brokerage at the New York-based
bank. Long-only managers may grapple with pre-trade requirements
that are different from their usual practice at the beginning,
he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign investors so far can only buy yuan shares listed in
Asia&#8217;s second-largest stock market through the qualified foreign
institutional investors, or QFII, and the renminbi QFII
programs. The link, set to start next month, will allow
investors, with or without their own QFII licenses, to buy as
much as 13 billion yuan ($2.1 billion) of Shanghai-traded yuan
stocks a day, according to a Sept. 4 statement posted on the
Hong Kong stock exchange&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Stock connect will be a game changer for most hedge
funds, allowing them to access A shares for the first time
without having to use banks&#8217; QFII quota,&#8221; Bolton said in an
interview in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. life insurers are piling into
the shadows of the corporate-bond market to boost income, even
as rising demand reduces the extra yield they get paid to hold
the debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About $728 billion of debt known as private placements were
held by insurers at the end of 2013, up from $678 billion two
years earlier, according to Fitch Ratings. Insurers are shifting
into harder-to-trade assets that generally offer higher yields
than publicly registered and actively traded securities, causing
those premiums to evaporate, according to Goldman Sachs (GS) Group
Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the investment-grade world today, that liquidity
premium is virtually gone,&#8221; John Melvin, who oversees fixed-income investments for insurers at Goldman Sachs Asset
Management, said by phone. Insurers &#8220;really have almost an
insatiable demand for investment product on the long end of the
yield curve,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With hundreds of billions of dollars to reinvest annually
and interest rates held near record lows by the Federal Reserve,
insurers are looking beyond public, investment-grade bonds,
according to BlackRock Inc. (BLK) In addition to private placements,
they&#8217;re weighing infrastructure bets and real estate, said
BlackRock&#8217;s David Lomas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Natural Holder&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Insurance companies are a natural holder&#8221; of less liquid
assets, said Lomas, who runs BlackRock&#8217;s global financial
institutions group. &#8220;They&#8217;ve got great cash flow, and they can
afford to extend their strategy into some of these areas.&#8221;
Insurers can hold premiums on life policies for decades before
paying death benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borrowers may choose private loans and bonds to limit
financial disclosures and save administrative costs. While that
contributes to the higher yields, it makes the debt harder to
sell should an insurer need to exit a holding to pay claims or
cut credit risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To the extent that you need to sell a security and
liquidate it, there&#8217;s less ability to do that without impacting
the price,&#8221; said Shachar Gonen, an analyst at Moody&#8217;s Investors
Service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Evaporating Premium &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At New York Life Insurance Co., the extra yield from less
liquid investment-grade debt has dropped by about half over the
last two years, to a range of 20 to 25 basis points, according
to Tony Malloy, who oversees a portfolio that was valued at more
than $185 billion at the end of 2013. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malloy&#8217;s company, the largest policyholder-owned U.S. life
insurer, allocates about 30 percent of its portfolio to private
placements and mortgage loans, up from about 25 percent five
years ago, he said. Since 2008, New York Life has built a
business to make its own loans, reducing its reliance on other
firms that originate the debt. That&#8217;s helped maintain spreads,
Malloy said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The competition for assets amongst insurance companies is
fierce, and so we had demand that was greater than the supply,&#8221;
Malloy said. &#8220;A way of meeting the demand that New York Life
had was to essentially open up the regional offices and go
knocking on the doors of corporations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Private Equity &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Goldman Sachs surveyed chief investment officers in
February and March, it found that insurers saw holding less-liquid assets as among the best strategies for increasing
returns. Insurers planned to boost allocations to private
equity, commercial mortgages, real estate equity and mezzanine
debt, Goldman Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While the interest in investment-grade traditional
private placements has been quite strong for the last several
years, that&#8217;s probably waning,&#8221; Melvin said. Insurers are
&#8220;moving down the credit curve.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American International Group Inc. said in June that it had
committed $1.5 billion to a venture with Oak Hill Capital
Management that will lend to mid-sized companies. The business,
called Varagon Capital Partners, will lend to companies with
earnings of as much as $75 million before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on investment-grade company bonds have dropped to
3.11 percent, less than 0.5 percentage point from the record-low
reached last year, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data. That compares with an average of 4.77 percent over
the past decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Price Disclosures &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority began
disseminating prices for the first time in June on debt issued
privately under a rule known as 144a, the latest step in the
agency&#8217;s effort to make over-the-counter debt markets more
transparent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With spreads declining for private bonds, the increase in
demand is probably nearer to the end than the beginning, said
Robert Derrick, co-head of the North American corporate finance
group at insurer Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU)&#8217;s private-lending
unit. The challenge is that the extra yield for taking on risk
is dropping across asset classes, said Alton Cogert, whose
Strategic Asset Alliance advises insurers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You don&#8217;t get a whole heck of a lot,&#8221; Cogert said.
&#8220;Nowadays, it&#8217;s so hard to get compensated for taking risk,
it&#8217;s crazy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) has approached Actavis Plc (ACT) to express its interest in an acquisition, people with knowledge of the matter said, as the U.S. drugmaker continues to explore ways to cut its tax rate and gain a new product pipeline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The companies aren&#8217;t currently in formal talks and Pfizer hasn&#8217;t made an offer, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. The approach comes after Pfizer in May abandoned a $114 billion bid for AstraZeneca Plc -- which would also have let it move its tax domicile abroad in a so-called tax inversion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Actavis, which is run from Parsippany, New Jersey, obtained an Irish tax domicile by acquiring Warner Chilcott Plc last year. Its shares rose 2.2 percent to $240.85 in New York trading today, giving Actavis a market value of about $63.6 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although AstraZeneca rebuffed its approach after Pfizer refused to pay the British company&#8217;s price, the American drugs giant is still considering pursuing that deal as well as other options, the people said. The company has determined any such deal needs to be friendly, unlike the unsolicited offer made to Astra, these people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Representatives for Pfizer and Actavis declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO) and PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) agreed to cut the amount of beverage calories that Americans consume by 20 percent over the next decade, saying they&#8217;ll more heavily promote smaller portion sizes, water and diet drinks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The American Beverage Association-backed effort, which also involves Dr Pepper Snapple Group (DPS), made the commitment at the Clinton Global Initiative Annual Meeting in New York today. The move builds on a 2006 agreement to limit portion sizes targeted at school kids, which resulted in beverage calories shipped to schools falling 90 percent between 2004 and 2010. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The latest campaign is a response to growing criticism of the industry, which is blamed for contributing to America&#8217;s obesity epidemic. Demand for sugary drinks has already been declining, though, suggesting that the industry could achieve these goals without much additional effort, said Jeff Cronin, a spokesman for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, one of the first groups to sound the alarm about sodas in the 1990s. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Non-diet soda is already in a free fall,&#8221; Cronin said in an interview. &#8220;There is no reason to think that trend wouldn&#8217;t accelerate on its own.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cronin estimates sales for such drinks have declined 15 percent since 1998. Volume sales could drop another 20 percent within a decade with no action by soft-drink makers at all, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adele and Mark Lee, who live in England with their three children, said they got approved for a U.S. mortgage without setting foot on American soil. The vacation home they&#8217;re buying near Florida&#8217;s Disney World would have been out of reach if they had to pay all cash. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It would have been a stretch,&#8221; said Adele, a 35-year-old nursery school teacher, speaking from the family&#8217;s home near Birmingham. &#8220;We wanted to keep some money here just to fall back on.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Lees are using a foreign-national mortgage, a loan for overseas buyers that required a 40 percent down payment, to purchase the five-bedroom house later this month for $423,000. Adele and her husband, a construction worker, plan to rent the Orlando property when they&#8217;re not living in it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lenders are providing greater access to credit for non-U.S. residents to finance vacation houses and investment properties. Foreign buyers, who are helping to fill a void left by Americans facing high borrowing hurdles, spent about $35 billion on U.S. homes using mortgages in the 12 months through March, a 46 percent increase from a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The American pool of borrowers is drying up,&#8221; said Anthony B. Sanders, an economics professor at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. &#8220;Middle-class borrowers have flatlined due to low income growth, and domestic investors are finding it less appetizing because the foreclosure inventory has dried up. So who do you go to? Foreign investors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Growing Share &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;At HSBC Holdings Plc, foreign-national mortgages, available to banking clients who deposit at least $15,000, account for about 30 percent of its U.S. home-lending business, according to Peter Alongi, a mortgage sales manager. That&#8217;s up from a share in the &#8220;teens&#8221; in 2008. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;FBC Mortgage LLC, an Orlando-based lender, has increased mortgages to international buyers by 65 percent this year compared with 2013. Calabasas, California-based Mega Capital Funding Inc. started lending to non-residents in June after seeing rising demand from Chinese buyers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Instead of buying two houses in cash they can buy four houses with loans,&#8221; said Brian Na, chief executive officer of Mega Capital, which is now issuing about $10 million of the mortgages a month. &#8220;At the same time, buyers can build a credit history in the U.S.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While many Americans struggle to qualify for mortgages, lenders are chasing wealthy buyers, including foreigners, whose loans typically require a 30 percent to 40 percent down payment compared with 20 percent for U.S. residents. Banks and smaller firms are offering more loan products to buyers based overseas, most of whom have paid cash for homes in the last few years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cash Sales &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cash sales have been falling and in June made up the lowest share of total home purchases, at 33 percent, since September 2008, according to CoreLogic Inc., an Irvine, California-based property-data firm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Florida, the state with the largest share of cash sales, smaller community banks have gotten increasingly comfortable lending to foreign buyers, said Rob Nunziata, CEO of FBC. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His firm typically offers nonresident borrowers adjustable-rate loans of as much as $750,000 that are fixed for three to five years. The mortgages require at least a 30 percent down payment and six months of cash reserves. Borrowing costs are generally one or two percentage points higher than conventional loans. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Credit Profiles &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The biggest challenges for lenders are verifying incomes and building credit profiles for non-U.S. residents. Their home countries have tax systems that differ from America&#8217;s and lenders have to rely on third parties, along with documentation from employers or accountants, said Nunziata. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of FBC&#8217;s borrowers, Yoram Yahav, said he purchased a few houses in cash before deciding to get a $100,000 loan for a Florida property. He&#8217;s seeking to build his U.S. credit profile because he plans to bring more foreign capital to America with other global investors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;You may have $2 million in your bank account in England, but if you want to borrow $80,000 in the U.S. you can&#8217;t because of this issue with credit,&#8221; said Yahav, whose Tel Aviv, Israel-based firm works with management teams in scenario planning for future events. &#8220;This way I can also increase my cash portion and have more money to put into new businesses.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While home loans were available to foreign nationals during the U.S. housing boom, financing dried up as banks tightened credit after the crash. Applications from international homebuyers are now at about the same level they reached during the peak in about 2006, when foreigners needed just a passport and an application to get a mortgage, according to Andy Scott, president of International Mortgages.Net in Orlando, which caters to mostly British clients, including the Lees. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Convoluted&#8217; Process &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The process is more convoluted,&#8221; Scott said. &#8220;It takes longer to get applications through. And there are a lot more checks and balances.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company, which has worked with international buyers in the U.S. and elsewhere for about 13 years, now uses seven lenders, up from only two after the housing bust. The firm moved from Scotland to Orlando a year ago because so many clients were purchasing there, Scott said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Buyers from the U.K., Canada, China, Mexico and India accounted for 54 percent of foreign sales in the year through March, data from NAR show. While Canada was the top source of international buyers, China accounted for the largest sales dollar volume because Chinese purchased more expensive properties on average, the Realtors report said. The top five states for international buying are Florida, California, Arizona, Texas and New York, according to the association. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Disney World &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Lees have only seen their vacation house in videos taken by their Realtor. They chose it for its swimming pool and proximity to Disney World, which they usually visit annually. The couple plans to rent it for the next five years and may eventually live there year-round. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s amazing what you can get over there for the money,&#8221; Adele said. &#8220;I also like that we could do everything over the Internet. We have noticed that Americans love paperwork. But the process was fairly straight forward.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rising prices and competition from cash-rich investors have kept many American homebuyers on the sidelines. Renters have also been blocked from homeownership by down payment requirements and &#8220;very strict underwriting standards,&#8221; said Stuart Miller, CEO of Lennar Corp., the largest U.S. homebuilder by market value. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The process itself has become fairly invasive,&#8221; Miller said last week on a call with investors. It&#8217;s &#8220;almost designed to scare people away.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Loan Dropoff &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mortgage applications for house purchases are 10 percent below the level a year earlier, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. Banks this year are also struggling to replace a falloff in lending dominated by refinancing, which plunged last year when borrowing costs spiked. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While more financing for foreigners will boost property purchases in the U.S., smaller lenders who can&#8217;t hold as much debt are constrained by a limited secondary market for selling their loans, said Na of Mega Capital. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Foreclosure of delinquent borrowers could also be a complicated process for some foreigners, such as those with diplomatic immunity, according to Joseph Pisa, CEO of Northstar Funding Inc., a Hoboken, New Jersey-based lender which focuses on the New York City area. While the borrowers can still get financing, rates are higher because of the additional risk, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jerry Barker, a real estate agent in Celebration, Florida, said half of his clients, which are mostly European, now get foreign national loans. That compares with about five percent three years ago. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our business has increased because we are able to sell to people we couldn&#8217;t sell to before,&#8221; said Barker. &#8220;Not everybody has a shoe box under their bedsprings with cash.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Heather Perlberg in Washington at hperlberg@bloomberg.net; Prashant Gopal in Boston at pgopal2@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editors responsible for this story: Kara Wetzel at kwetzel@bloomberg.net Vincent Bielski &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s European head of spot foreign-exchange trading, Mitesh Parikh, is leaving after 12 years to join a hedge-fund firm, according to two people with knowledge of the move. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Parikh, 35, is resigning to trade currencies at an investment firm, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the move isn&#8217;t public. Parikh, who worked in London, didn&#8217;t respond to a message left with a colleague or to e-mails to his work address. He joined Goldman Sachs in July 2002, according to his LinkedIn profile. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs spokesman declined to comment on the move. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His departure marks the continued exodus of traders from banks amid cost cutting and increased regulation that prevents proprietary trading and limits the capital trading desks may put at risk. The number of bankers doing business in the Group of 10 currencies shrank to 2,278 in the first half of this year from 2,929 in the same period of 2010, according to London-based consulting firm Coalition Ltd. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Regulators are also probing the $5.3 trillion-a-day market over allegations dealers leaked confidential client information and colluded to rig benchmarks. The scandal may cost lenders as much as $15 billion in fines, according to Chirantan Barua, a London-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd. Parikh&#8217;s move is unrelated to any investigations, the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Talented Individuals&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s no surprise to see talented individuals looking to move to a less constrained environment,&#8221; said John Purcell, chief executive officer of London-based executive-search firm Purcell  Co. &#8220;In the political heat generated during the recent downturn, regulators became over zealous trying to out do each other with their &#8216;bash the banks, tough-guy approach.&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Citigroup&#8217;s Jeffrey Feig and Deutsche Bank AG&#8217;s Christopher Fahy were hired by Fortress Investment Group LLC, the first publicly traded private-equity and hedge-fund manager in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rohan Ramchandani, Citigroup&#8217;s former European head of foreign-exchange spot trading, began at an online-trading firm earlier this month. Darren Coote, global head of spot foreign exchange at Lloyds Banking Group Plc, resigned for personal reasons in April. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank&#8217;s global head of foreign exchange, Kevin Rodgers, left in June after 15 years to join the performing arts. He recently sang the parts of four villains in Jacques Offenbach&#8217;s &#8220;Tales of Hoffmann&#8221; and is set to appear in the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta &#8220;The Mikado&#8221; in London. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Julia Verlaine in London at jverlaine2@bloomberg.net; Ambereen Choudhury in London at achoudhury@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editors responsible for this story: Edward Evans at eevans3@bloomberg.net Steve Bailey &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Frozen&#8221; is still hot. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two toys based off Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s hit animated film made Adventure Publishing Group&#8217;s Toy Insider Hot 20 list released today, making it the only entertainment property with multiple items on the roster. Disney and its licensees had seven items on the list, a selection of toys Adventure&#8217;s experts expect to top kids&#8217; wish lists during the holiday season. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s movie about a princess with magical powers was released on Thanksgiving last year and racked up more than $1 billion in global ticket sales, making it the fifth-highest grossing film of all time. The success caught toymakers by surprise, resulting in a dearth of related merchandise and creating a secondary market that saw &#8220;Frozen&#8221; dresses selling for more than $1,000 online. This holiday season, Disney and its licensees are better prepared, with plenty of inventory and products to satisfy fans. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a frozen Christmas, ice cold,&#8221; said Laurie Schacht, president of Adventure Publishing, which produces toy-industry magazines. &#8220;The appeal is so broad, and it&#8217;s such a wonderful story that parents are happy to put merchandise like this in their kids&#8217; hands.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &#8220;Frozen"-themed items on this year&#8217;s list are a singing, moving doll of the movie&#8217;s protagonist, Elsa, as well as the Cool Tunes Sing-Along Boombox -- a small karaoke machine for the film&#8217;s best-selling soundtrack. Both items retail for about $35. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V), the world&#8217;s largest
payments network, is creating 2,000 full-time jobs as the
company expands teams in Singapore and the U.S. and opens a
technology center in India. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total includes new roles and existing contractor jobs
that are being converted into full-time positions, the Foster
City, California-based company said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Recruitment efforts, which are currently under way and
will continue through 2017, will focus on a range of technology
needs spanning data scientists, engineers, platform architects
and mobile developers,&#8221; the company said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa plans to open a new technology-development center in
India and is adding staff in Austin, Texas; Ashburn, Virginia;
the San Francisco area and Denver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment &#8220;allows us to strengthen our talent pool
globally, and bring more of it in-house,&#8221; Rajat Taneja,
executive vice president of technology, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company opened a new outpost in San Francisco in July.
Visa has been expanding its digital and mobile products and
services, and in July introduced Visa Checkout, which it said
will allow consumers to make purchases faster online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Apple Inc. said its new iPhones include
a payment system that relies on card networks including Visa as
well as banks. As part of the partnership, Visa offers bank
clients a new service that replaces account information with a
digital token. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Visa increases its investments in in-house capabilities,
the firm is reducing its stake in other startups. Visa said
Sept. 18 it was considering its options regarding an investment
in Monitise Plc, a London-based mobile-payments firm. &lt;/p&gt;

get global rights to the characters, excluding Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move builds on Hasbro&#8217;s effort to increase its appeal
among girls, who once flocked to Mattel product lines such as
Barbie. Over the past decade, Hasbro has used My Little Pony and
other brands to expand its girls&#8217; business to more than $1
billion in revenue, up from less than $300 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have a true understanding of girls globally and how
today&#8217;s girls want to play,&#8221; Hasbro Chief Executive Officer
Brian Goldner said in the statement. &#8220;The entire Hasbro team is
looking forward to providing consumers with inventive new play
experiences based on the beloved Disney Princess and Frozen
characters and stories.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Hasbro, based in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, gained
as much as 3.5 percent to $54.78 after the Disney announcement.
That&#8217;s the biggest intraday gain since April 21. Before today,
the stock was down 3.8 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. has approached Actavis Plc about a deal that could allow the U.S. drugmaker to move its address overseas and reduce taxes, in a sign the Obama administration&#8217;s efforts to curtail inversions might fall short. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pfizer made its approach before the U.S. Treasury Department announced new rules Sept. 22 to make such deals -- called tax inversions -- more difficult, people with knowledge of the matter said. Those changes won&#8217;t deter Pfizer, even if they are a complication, one of the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private information. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another high-profile inversion deal, Burger King Worldwide Inc.&#8217;s purchase of Tim Hortons Inc., will proceed, the Canadian company said after the rule changes were revealed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How U.S. Companies Buy Tax Breaks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew could take further steps, he steered clear of putting an end to a key benefit of inversions, which allow companies to lower their U.S. earnings by shifting profits overseas using a technique known as earnings stripping. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The ability to shelter future foreign earnings from U.S. tax seems to be a principal objective and, as far as I can see, that benefit remains,&#8221; said Robert Willens, a corporate tax consultant in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank, hired Mustafa Bagriacik from Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) to head
its business in Turkey and Azerbaijan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bagriacik, who has run the German lender&#8217;s investment
banking operations in Turkey since 2009, will start his new role
as senior country officer for the two nations on Oct. 1, the New
York-based bank said in an e-mailed statement. He will replace
Emre Derman who left the bank earlier this year, according to a
spokeswoman for JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment banking activity in the nation is recovering as
mergers and acquisitions pick up after two elections wins by the
ruling AK Party. Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604), Japan&#8217;s largest
brokerage, said in March it had received a license to open a
representative office in Turkey. In March, Finance Minister
Mehmet Simsek said that Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was applying to
the regulator to open a representative office in Turkey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Bank of Greece SA has hired banks including
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to sell as much as 40 percent of
Turkish unit Finansbank AS (FINBN) in a secondary share offering, four
people familiar with the matter said Sept. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bagriacik will oversee the bank&#8217;s corporate, investment
banking and asset management business in both countries in his
new role, according to the statement. He will report to Sjoerd Leenart, senior country officer for the Middle East, Turkey and
Africa. Prior to Deutsche Bank, Bagriacik worked at Goldman
Sachs in London for 10 years, covering Turkish investment
banking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bagriacik and Deutsche Bank declined to comment when
contacted by phone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s stocks rose, sending the
benchmark index to its biggest gain in about seven weeks, as a
jump in new trading accounts lifted brokerages and defense
companies rallied on speculation of increased state spending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citic Securities Co. climbed 3.4 percent and Changjiang
Securities Co. (000783) advanced by the 10 percent daily limit. Jiangxi
Hongdu Aviation Industry Co. surged 10 percent. President Xi
Jinping called on the People&#8217;s Liberation Army to boost their
combat readiness, according to a Xinhua News Agency report on
Sept. 22. China Coal Energy Co. rallied 3.8 percent in Hong
Kong, leading energy shares higher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) advanced 1.5 percent to
2,343.58, its highest close since March 2013. Investors opened
about 217,000 accounts last week, the most in two years, amid
speculation an exchange link with Hong Kong and government
stimulus will boost stocks. The 30-day average value of shares
traded in Shanghai rose to the highest level since April 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are still positive on China,&#8221; Daphne Roth, head of
Asian equity research at ABN Amro Private Banking, which manages
about $218 billion, said by phone from Singapore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index increased 1.4 percent
from a two-month low in Hong Kong. The Hang Seng Index added
0.35 percent. The CSI 300 Index of China&#8217;s biggest companies
advanced 1.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stock Valuations &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai Composite has gained 11 percent this year and
trades at 8.5 times projected 12-months earnings, while the Hang
Seng China Enterprises (HSCEI) has declined 0.9 percent and is valued at
6.8 times. The Hang Seng China AH Premium index climbed to 96.81
yesterday, its highest level since May 13, signaling a narrowing
gap between dual-listed stocks in Hong Kong and Shanghai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exchange link with Hong Kong is set to start next month
and allows a net 23.5 billion yuan ($3.8 billion) of daily
cross-border purchases. China is counting on the link&#8217;s success
to help liberalize its financial system, increase the role of
the yuan and give its citizens more investment channels amid a
slumping property market and increased risks from local wealth-management products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are strong expectations for reforms as we approach
the start of Shanghai-Hong Kong link,&#8221; said Mao Sheng, an
analyst at Huaxi Securities Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gauge of financial stocks on the CSI 300 rallied 2.2
percent, the most since Aug. 4. Brokerages accounted for all 10
of the biggest movers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citic Securities closed at its highest level since Sept. 5,
while Changjiang Securities climbed to its highest since March
2011. The number of funded accounts increased by about 158,000
last week, the most since February, after falling to the lowest
level since 2010 the previous week, according to official
securities data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PLA Meeting &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among defense-related companies, Jiangxi Hongdu Aviation
extended its advance this year to 59 percent. Hafei Aviation
Industry Co. climbed 8.1 percent today. AVIC Aircraft Co. shares
were suspended pending an announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PLA chiefs of staff met in Beijing on Sept. 21 to
discuss how to improve the efficiency of military command,
Xinhua reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI China Energy Index climbed 1.9 percent,  the
biggest gain among the broader gauge&#8217;s 10 industry groups and
paring this month&#8217;s rout to 7.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Coal Energy, the second-largest listed mainland
producer of the commodity, rose the most in three weeks. Yanzhou
Coal Mining Co. advanced 2.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China, both the world&#8217;s biggest market for coal and worst
carbon-dioxide emitter, is seeking to reduce output at the
nation&#8217;s 14 largest producers after prices slumped amid efforts
to moderate economic growth and fight pollution. More than 70
percent of miners are unprofitable and half are delaying or
cutting wage payments, according to the China Coal Industry
Association. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re probably seeing a technical rebound triggered by
speculation the government will come with measures to help coal
producers,&#8221; said Ben Kwong, a director at KGI Asia Ltd. said.
&#8220;There&#8217;s recent news the government will restrict coal output
and imports. That should help reduce stockpiling problems.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Context Relevant Inc., a maker of
software that analyzes data and makes predictions, raised $13.5
million from a group of investors including Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) and Bank of America Corp. to fund expansion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each bank will get a seat on the Seattle-based company&#8217;s
board, said Chief Executive Officer Stephen Purpura, who founded
the company in 2012. The banks will also use Context Relevant&#8217;s
technology, the company said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Context Relevant also raised funds from New York Life
Insurance Co. and existing venture investors Formation 8 and
Bloomberg Beta. The company raised $21 million three months ago,
and total funding to date is $42 million. Bloomberg Beta is a
unit of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We raised another round because we are growing
exponentially and achieved all the goals set by the previous
round,&#8221; Purpura said in an interview. He declined to comment on
the company&#8217;s valuation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Context Relevant&#8217;s technology can be used to predict
external and internal threats such as hacking, data theft and
insider trading, and the company generates revenue from annual
software licenses. The software developer is seeking to boost
the number of employees to 200 from the current 50, and needs to
hire analysts, sales staff and customer-service representatives,
Purpura said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Context Relevant also said it hired Richard Clarke, former
U.S. National Coordinator for Security and Counter-terrorism, as
acting head of its security products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Data, Security &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the wake of recent breaches at banks, exchanges, hedge
funds, payment processors and retailers, it is clear that there
is a market for Context Relevant to deliver automated
intelligent systems to help address these challenges,&#8221; Clarke,
who was already advising Context Relevant, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. and at least other four banks were
attacked last month by Russian hackers who stole gygabites of
customers&#8217; data people familiar with the investigation have
said. Home Depot Inc. (HD) and Target Corp. (TGT) have also been the target
of attacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other startups such as Palantir Technologies Inc., a
software maker co-founded by Formation 8 partner Joe Lonsdale,
and DataRobot Inc. also develop predictive software that can
analyze data and detect potential threats. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Factors ranging from monetary-policy divergence to inflation trends indicate the dollar&#8217;s
rally against its major peers during the past four months has
scope to continue, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Dollar Index posted its a 10th consecutive gain
last week, the longest streak since 1967, and reached 85.485
today, the highest level since July 2010. It also still trades
at almost its 10-year average, as measured by the
Intercontinental Exchange Inc. gauge that tracks the greenback
against the currencies of six U.S. trading partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As big as the dollar move looks close up, it is actually
small in historical and economic terms,&#8221; Robin Brooks,
Goldman&#8217;s New York-based chief currency strategist, wrote in a
note to clients today. In &#8220;reaction to client meetings in
recent days, many have sticker shock at the recent strengthening
in the dollar and are instinctively on the sidelines as they
await/ hope for a pull-back,&#8221; he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. currency may build on its gains versus the euro as
the region&#8217;s central bank meeting next week will highlight
policy and economic divergence. European Central Bank President
Mario Draghi will have an opportunity to further explain his
plans to expand the central bank&#8217;s balance sheet via bond-buying, Brooks wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inflation Range &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting is also likely to bring focus to below-target
inflation within the currency bloc nations. Draghi&#8217;s preferred
gauge of inflation expectations, the five-year/five-year
inflation swap rate, fell to 1.91 percent on Sept. 19, the
lowest on a closing basis since October 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We do not think euro-dollar at current levels remotely
prices the kind of balance sheet expansion that President Draghi
talked about in September,&#8221; Brooks wrote. &#8220;So that coming
press conferences, including next week&#8217;s, are an opportunity for
the ECB to spell out the way forward, which we think will set
the stage for more euro-dollar downside.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since reaching $1.3993 on May 8, the strongest in 2 1/2
years, the euro has slumped 9.1 percent as the currency bloc&#8217;s
economic expansion stopped in the second quarter as its three
biggest economies -- Germany, France and Italy -- failed to
grow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman cut its six-month forecast on the single currency
last month to $1.25 from $1.34, and projects it will weaken to
parity by the end of 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve officials increased their median estimate
for the federal funds rate to 1.375 percent at the end of next
year on Sept. 17, versus June&#8217;s forecast for 1.125 percent and
virtually zero now. The extra yield investors get from holding
U.S. Treasuries instead of Germany&#8217;s two-year bunds rose to 0.64
percentage point yesterday, the widest since April 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The recent dollar strength has really been an unusual
confluence of idiosyncratic trends,&#8221; Brooks wrote. &#8220;We expect
the coming months to bring higher front-end rates in the U.S. as
Fed forward guidance fades, giving rise to real dollar strength.
This is not an environment conducive to a pull-back.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poland&#8217;s top three coal companies,
burdened by losses amid communist-era benefit payments and a
market glut, are hiring banks including JPMorgan Chase  Co. and
BNP Paribas SA to sell debut Eurobonds to raise cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc and BNP Paribas were picked by Katowicki
Holding Weglowy SA, the third-biggest coal-miner, to manage a
euro-denominated debt sale, two people familiar with the plan
said on Sept. 18, asking not to be identified because the
details are private. Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse Group AG
were also hired by the miners, separate people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unprecedented rush for international financing is
occurring as mining unions prepare protests against plans by the
state-controlled companies to restructure operations and clamp
down on benefits. Kompania Weglowa SA, the European Union&#8217;s
largest producer, said this week it will scrap free coal
allowances for 160,000 retired employees, which cost it about
260 million zloty ($79.1 million) annually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Foreign issues are the only way for these companies to
gain funds,&#8221; Mariusz Zarod, a money manager at BZ WBK Asset
Management in Poznan, Poland, with the equivalent of $3.7
billion under management, said by e-mail yesterday. &#8220;If they
manage to pull it off, they will probably sell high-yield notes,
even though some investors won&#8217;t go near them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Falling Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kompania, which had a 675.7 million-zloty net loss last
year, chose Barclays, BNP and Deutsche Bank for its offering,
according to separate people familiar with the plan. The company
aims to meet three rating companies by early October, spokesman
Tomasz Zieba said last week, declining to comment on the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third miner, Jastrzebska Spolka Weglowa SA, hired
JPMorgan and Credit Suisse for a sale of at least $500 million
in notes in the fourth quarter, a person familiar with the
details said last month. Spokeswoman Katarzyna Jablonska-Bajer
declined to comment by phone yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices of European coal for delivery next year fell to
$75.2 a ton at 2:23 p.m. in Warsaw today, the lowest level since
March 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Waning demand is
also compounded by &#8220;overstaffing, mismanagement and numerous
unions,&#8221; Zarod said. Scrapping the free coal benefits will help
Kompania avoid bankruptcy and pave the way for long-term
financing, the company said in the Sept. 23 e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miners ran up a combined 772.3 million-zloty net loss in
the first half, compared with profit of 15.6 million zloty a
year earlier, the Economy Ministry said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Industry Headwinds &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katowicki Holding will seek to raise 500 million euros
($636 million) of bonds in November to refinance existing debt
and boost working capital, Chief Financial Officer Artur Trzeciakowski told PAP newswire on Sept. 18. The company earlier
held talks with &#8220;most banks&#8221; in Poland and failed to convince
them to increase their funding, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Polish debt offerings come as some eastern European
miners face headwinds. Russia&#8217;s economy minister said last week
he saw no alternative to bankruptcy for OAO Mechel, the
country&#8217;s biggest producer of coking coal, following nine months
of unsuccessful efforts to refinance its debt. New World
Resources Plc, a Czech miner, is restructuring 775 million euros
of bonds after falling coal prices hit it with seven consecutive
quarterly losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polish government debt has attracted investors seeking less
risky regional assets amid the fallout from the Ukraine crisis.
The yield on the 2019 euro-denominated sovereign bond declined
to a record low of 0.61 percent today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It should be possible for Polish miners to place
Eurobonds (BEMC) as long as they are state-controlled,&#8221; Clemens Hansmann, a money manager at Gutmann Kapitalanlage AG in Vienna,
which oversees 7 billion euros of assets, said by e-mail
yesterday. &#8220;There is a structural decline in global demand for
thermal coal. For the Polish coal mines, this pressure will
continue&#8221; and &#8220;investors are well aware of these structural
issues,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s Marvel
Entertainment settled its copyright dispute with the children of
the late comic book artist Jack Kirby, who helped create the
Incredible Hulk and X-Men characters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Marvel and the family of Jack Kirby have amicably
resolved their legal disputes, and are looking forward to
advancing their shared goal of honoring Mr. Kirby&#8217;s significant
role in Marvel&#8217;s history,&#8221; the company and the Kirby family
said in a joint statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family in March petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to
review their case after both a federal judge in New York and a
federal appeals court had agreed with Marvel that their father&#8217;s
drawings were work-for-hire and the family couldn&#8217;t terminate
the publisher&#8217;s copyright to the characters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney acquired Marvel for $4.2 billion in 2009. Since
then, characters such as Iron Man and Thor have proved box
office gold for the Burbank, California-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Marvel&#8217;s The Avengers&#8221; was the top-grossing film of
2012. This year&#8217;s &#8220;Guardians of the Galaxy,&#8221; based on lesser-known Marvel characters, also led the domestic box office with
$315 million in tickets sold since its August release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spider-Man Fees &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Licensing fees from merchandise tied to Marvel characters
such as Spider-Man have boosted the results of Disney&#8217;s
consumer-products division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, Kirby&#8217;s adult children sent 45 notices to Marvel
to terminate license renewals for the characters in comics
published from 1958 to 1963. Marvel sued in January 2010,
seeking a judgment that the termination notices were invalid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirby, who died in 1994, also created or co-created the
Fantastic Four and the Avengers. His heirs said their father was
a freelance artist paid by the page who received no benefits
from Marvel. Stan Lee, who worked for Marvel as an editor, is
credited as co-author of the Hulk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marvel said in court papers that Kirby granted the company
rights to the characters in 1972 and that his children waited
too long to make their copyright claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Marvel Worldwide Inc. v. Kirby, 10-00141, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), HSBC Holdings
Plc (HSBA) and Credit Agricole SA (ACA) delayed by months the European
Union&#8217;s investigation into Euribor rigging amid scrutiny of
possible EU bias, according to three people familiar with the
case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trio gained more time to respond to the EU&#8217;s May
antitrust complaint after demanding to see files necessary for
their defense, said the people who asked not to be named because
the issue is private. These requests have been taken more
seriously since the EU&#8217;s ombudsman started inquiring into Credit
Agricole&#8217;s bias allegations, two of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The European Commission doesn&#8217;t want to appear to have
been too tough on Credit Agricole,&#8221; Adrien Giraud, a lawyer at
Willkie Farr  Gallagher LLP, said. &#8220;That might explain why
they were more lenient on deadlines than usually.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Euribor-rigging investigation has been strained since
the three refused to join four other lenders including Deutsche
Bank AG (DBK) and Societe Generale SA (GLE) who paid a total of 1 billion
euros ($1.3 billion) to settle the case. The delays -- including
the latest scrapping of a mid-September deadline for responses -
- robbed Joaquin Almunia, the EU&#8217;s antitrust chief, of the
chance to impose another set of fines on the finance industry as
he prepares to leave office at the end of next month, the people
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives for the commission, JPMorgan, HSBC and
Credit Agricole all declined to comment on the Euribor
investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Failed Settlement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almunia said this month that time has run out in his two-year long quest to clinch an antitrust settlement with Google
Inc. (GOOG) He&#8217;s also conceded that he won&#8217;t have time to complete an
antitrust probe into credit derivatives trading by 13 of the
world&#8217;s biggest banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s clear that Almunia has accepted that he won&#8217;t be
able to finalize several cases&#8221; and Euribor &#8220;is just one more
on his list,&#8221; Giraud said. &#8220;The officials working on the case
aren&#8217;t therefore in as much of a hurry.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU ombudsman, the internal EU watchdog, opened a case
on July 31 after Credit Agricole complained that public comments
made by Almunia indicated he had already made up his mind about
the conclusion of the Euribor investigation, Bloomberg News
reported this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almunia&#8217;s stance explains the banks&#8217; determination to try
to delay the case until after his departure, said the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Fairness and Transparency&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His successor, former Danish Economy Minister Margrethe Vestager, is scheduled to take over the EU antitrust brief and
deal with the EU ombudsman&#8217;s inquiry at the start of November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vestager said this month that all cases should be &#8220;treated
with fairness and transparency.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from examining Euribor, Vestager will inherit a
preliminary probe into suspected rigging of foreign-exchange
markets, which is part of a global scandal that tarnished the
reputation of some of the world&#8217;s biggest lenders. Oil
benchmarks are also under scrutiny. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, HSBC and Credit Agricole were accused on May 20
by the commission of colluding to rig Euribor rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called statement of objections was the next step in
the EU enforcement process after the banks dropped out of
settlement talks last year. The EU procedure allows them to
respond to the complaint in writing and request a hearing. If
companies fail to deflect accusations in antitrust cases they
are then usually fined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Euro Interbank Offered Rate, or Euribor, and Libor, the
London Interbank Offered Rate, gauge banks&#8217; estimated cost of
borrowing over different periods of time. Libor alone is the
benchmark interest rate for more than $300 trillion of
securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Banks Prejudged &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While JPMorgan, HSBC and Credit Agricole haven&#8217;t yet been
found liable, the December settlements spell out their role in
helping to manipulate Euribor, said another person familiar with
the confidential EU documents. This suggested the EU had
prejudged the three banks before they were given their full due-process rights, said the person who is familiar with the
reasoning of a settling bank and raised the issue with the
commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission shouldn&#8217;t make &#8220;any allusion to the
liability&#8221; of companies in a final decision -- such as the
December Euribor settlements -- before the firms are given a
chance to fend off charges, according to EU case law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The companies could argue their case has been decided
before they had the chance to defend themselves,&#8221; said Alfonso
Lamadrid, a lawyer at Garrigues in Brussels who&#8217;s not involved
in the case. This would give them &#8220;new procedural ammunition to
challenge an eventual sanction&#8221; in court. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aabar Investments PJSC, owned by
Abu Dhabi&#8217;s sovereign wealth fund, is working with Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) as it explores options for its stake in RHB Capital
Bhd. (RHBC), according to people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aabar, the Malaysian bank&#8217;s second-largest shareholder with
a 21.2 percent stake, is seeking to protect the value of its
investment as the lender negotiates a three-way, $27 billion 
merger with CIMB Group Holdings Bhd. (CIMB) and Malaysia Building 
Society Bhd., the people said. It hasn&#8217;t yet signed a formal 
mandate with Goldman Sachs, one person said, asking not to be 
identified as the talks are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CIMB, Malaysia&#8217;s second-biggest bank, and RHB are
discussing structuring the deal as a reverse takeover, people
familiar with the matter said this month. The structure of the
transaction, which would value RHB at about 1.4 times book
value, is designed to overcome any potential resistance from
Aabar as it would require approval from only a majority of RHB
investors, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sophie Ramsay, a London-based spokeswoman for Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment. Aabar officials didn&#8217;t respond to
several e-mails and phone calls seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aabar bought its RHB stake from Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank
PJSC for 10.80 ringgit per share in 2011, when RHB was the
target of a takeover battle between the country&#8217;s biggest lender
Malayan Banking Bhd. and CIMB. RHB shares traded at 8.86 ringgit
at 3:07 p.m. today in Kuala Lumpur, 18 percent below Aabar&#8217;s
purchase price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;EPF&#8217;s Vote &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CIMB, RHB and Malaysia Building Society (MBS) in July announced
plans for a three-way merger that would create the country&#8217;s
largest banking group by assets. The companies, which have a
combined market value of about $27 billion, entered into a 90-day exclusive agreement to negotiate and finalize the price and
structure of the merger, according to a July 10 joint statement
from the lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under a proposal being discussed, RHB would issue new
shares to acquire CIMB, whose market value is two and a half
times bigger, people familiar with the talks said earlier this
month. An outright acquisition by CIMB would require approval
from 75 percent of RHB shareholders, leaving Aabar in a stronger
position to scuttle the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, engaging with Aabar may become more important amid
uncertainty about whether Malaysian pension manager Employees
Provident Fund, which owns stakes in all three banks, will be
allowed by the country&#8217;s stock exchange to vote on the deal. EPF
controls 40.9 percent of RHB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EPF wrote to the three lenders on Aug. 26, saying it should
be given a waiver allowing the fund to vote on the proposed
merger, Malaysian newspaper The Star reported Sept. 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CIMB and RHB are discussing making the merger proposal
conditional on EPF being allowed to vote, three people familiar
with the talks said. The exclusivity period for the merger talks
expires Oct. 8. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia, viewed by the Obama administration as hostile to U.S. interests, has discovered what may prove to be a vast pool of oil in one of the world&#8217;s most remote places with the help of America&#8217;s largest energy company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Russia&#8217;s state-run OAO Rosneft said a well drilled in the Kara Sea region of the Arctic Ocean with Exxon Mobil Corp. struck oil, showing the region has the potential to become one of the world&#8217;s most important crude-producing areas. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The announcement was made by Igor Sechin, Rosneft&#8217;s chief executive officer, who spent two days sailing on a Russian research ship to the drilling rig where the find was unveiled today. The well found about 1 billion barrels of oil and similar geology nearby means the surrounding area may hold more than the U.S. part of the Gulf or Mexico, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It exceeded our expectations,&#8221; Sechin said in an interview. This discovery is of &#8220;exceptional significance in showing the presence of hydrocarbons in the Arctic.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The discovery sharpens the dispute between Russia and the U.S. over President Vladimir Putin&#8217;s actions in Ukraine. The well was drilled before the Oct. 10 deadline Exxon was granted by the U.S. government under sanctions barring American companies from working in Russia&#8217;s Arctic offshore. Rosneft and Exxon won&#8217;t be able to do more drilling, putting the exploration and development of the area on hold despite the find announced today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s Xalkori for advanced
lung cancer shrunk tumors in those with a rare genetic mutation,
according to a study that may provide the first targeted
treatment for these patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xalkori reduced the size of tumors in 36 of 50 patients in
the study while halting tumor growth in another nine, according
to company-funded research released today at the European
Society for Medical Oncology meeting in Madrid and online in the
New England Journal of Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 15,000 people, or 1 percent of the estimated 1.5
million annual new cases of non-small-cell lung cancer, have an
abnormality to the ROS1 gene, according to New York-based
Pfizer. Today&#8217;s findings also showed that Xalkori was effective
for about 18 months in patients, longer than the average eight
to 12 months seen for some other targeted treatments, said Alice
Shaw, a lead study author. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing much longer durations of remissions,&#8221; Shaw,
an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;This points to being a very good target in lung
cancer and this drug being a very effective targeted therapy for
these patients.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xalkori helps shut off the ROS1 gene that is causing cancer
tumors to grow, she said. It was approved in 2011 to treat non-small-cell lung cancers in patients with mutations to the ALK
gene, which has structural similarities to the ROS1 gene. The
National Comprehensive Cancer Network, an alliance of 25 cancer
centers, already recommends that doctors use Xalkori in patients
who have this gene defect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More Testing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pfizer continues to support clinical research of Xalkori
in patients with ROS1 rearrangements to better understand the
compound&#8217;s activity in this population,&#8221; Sally Beatty, a
company spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cancer drug generated $282 million in 2013 sales,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The drug may produce
revenue of more than $812 million in 2017, according to the
average of five analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with a mutation to the ROS1 gene are often younger
and usually aren&#8217;t smokers, Shaw said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s study is an expansion of the original Phase 1
clinical trial of Xalkori in patients with the ALK gene
mutation. Researchers enrolled 50 patients who were ROS1
positive starting in late 2010 through August 2013. Those in the
study received Xalkori two times daily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the trial, half of the patients were still
getting Xalkori and had no signs of their tumors growing, the
authors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re hopeful that because of showing how well this drug
works in ROS1 patients, this will let pathologists know they
need to screen their patients for this genetic abnormality,&#8221;
Shaw said. &#8220;In lung cancer there&#8217;s been a lot of progress made
in targeted therapies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), maker of the Xbox
video-game consoles, said it plans to open its first flagship
store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, about six blocks from a
similar location operated by Apple Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s store will open at 677 Fifth Avenue, according
to a blog post. The company didn&#8217;t say when the store would
open. The address is currently home to luxury retailer Fendi,
according to Google Maps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is acquiring Mojang AB, the software company

its Surface tablet and Windows Phones. The Mojang purchase would
give Microsoft a game that&#8217;s popular across consoles, computers

&lt;p&gt;The European Central Bank will
start its asset-purchase program with covered bonds because
large trades in the debt are easier than for asset-backed
securities, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new-issue market for covered notes is more active than
for asset-backed debt and investors typically hold larger
amounts than ABS buyers, JPMorgan analysts led by Gareth Davies
wrote in a note to clients. With 791 billion euros ($1 trillion)
of covered bonds outstanding, compared with 251 billion euros of
ABS, the central bank will also find it easier to expand its
balance sheet, Davies said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Policy makers are seeking to spur economic growth by
encouraging lending and will disclose the size and details of
the program after policy makers meet this week. ECB President
Mario Draghi, who has made the revival of the ABS market a top
priority this year as he seeks to channel credit to businesses
by freeing up bank balance sheets, mentioned purchases of
covered bonds for the first time this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The ECB is likely to begin its purchase program in the
covered bond space as it is unlikely to be able to do meaningful
size in the ABS market,&#8221; London-based Davies said in a
telephone interview today. &#8220;If the ECB wants a strong sentiment
change by making large purchases it&#8217;s hard to do that in the
secondary or new-issue ABS markets as there quite simply aren&#8217;t
enough bonds.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debt-buying plans have been greeted with skepticism by
investors who suggest the central bank will struggle to buy
enough securities after the market contracted more than 40
percent since 2010. Covered bond purchases are being considered
to expand the amount of assets available to purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Retained ABS &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Draghi said earlier this month the Frankfurt-based central
bank will buy a broad portfolio of &#8220;simple and transparent
securities&#8221; that will include ABS and covered bonds. While
declining to disclose the size of the program, he signaled a
willingness to grow the ECB&#8217;s balance sheet by as much 1
trillion euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe&#8217;s public ABS market isn&#8217;t big enough to achieve that
goal and purchases of the 635 billion euros of notes created and
retained by banks to use as collateral for central bank funding
during the financial crisis wouldn&#8217;t effect the ECB&#8217;s balance
sheet, said Davies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks create asset-backed securities by bundling individual
loans such as mortgages, auto credit and credit-card debt.
Covered bonds are guaranteed by the issuer and have a designated
pool of assets, such as mortgages and public sector loans, which
can be used to meet payments if the issuer can&#8217;t. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) will pay $200
million less for International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)&#8217;s low-end
server unit, with the transaction closing this week after
passing a review conducted amid heightened tensions between the
U.S. and China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final price will be $2.1 billion, down from the $2.3
billion originally announced in January, to reflect lower-than-projected inventories at the time of the Oct. 1 closing, Brion Tingler, a spokesman for Lenovo, said by phone today. The
transaction wasn&#8217;t restructured, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal was cleared by the Committee on Foreign Investment
in the U.S., or CFIUS, in August. The review was conducted
during a dispute between the world&#8217;s two largest economies over
cybersecurity after U.S. prosecutors in May accused five Chinese
military officials of stealing trade secrets and other
information from American companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After completing the deal, IBM will be rid of a less-profitable business, allowing it to focus on growing areas such
as cloud computing and data analytics, while Lenovo gains a
larger piece of the global computing-hardware market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Completion of the transaction will make Lenovo the third-largest server vendor in the world, behind Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)
and Dell Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) lost a bid to
block buyers of $10 billion worth of residential mortgage-backed
securities it packaged in 2007 to proceed as a group with their
lawsuit alleging the bank misled them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge J. Paul Oetken in Manhattan today ruled
that the claims of investors in nine separate offerings of the
securities were similar enough for them to move forward as a
class on the question of whether JPMorgan is liable for making
false and misleading statements in the offering documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling only applies to liability. Oetken said he wasn&#8217;t
convinced at this stage that there&#8217;s a damages calculation that
would cover the claims of all the investors included in the
group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan last year agreed to a $13 billion settlement with
the U.S. to resolve allegations the bank misled investors in
mortgage-backed securities about the soundness and risks of the
investments that helped bring on subprime-mortgage crisis of
2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Because the class is currently certified for liability
purposes, this phase of litigation will focus on the issue of
whether defendants made material false statements or omissions
in the offering documents that affected the value of the
certificates owned by the plaintiff class members,&#8221; the judge
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment on today&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class certification will allow individual investors who
haven&#8217;t filed a lawsuit to be represented by the lead plaintiff
in a single case because their experiences and legal claims are
similar. Class-action status is less expensive for plaintiffs
than filing multiple lawsuits and provides leverage in
settlement negotiations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Fort Worth Employees&#8217; Retirement Fund v. J.P.
Morgan Chase  Co., 09-cv-3701, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. will review its conflict-of-interest policy for investment bankers after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. barred some employees from owning individual securities, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Executives at Citigroup still regard its less-restrictive policy as strong enough to prevent conflicts, according to the person, who asked for anonymity because the review isn&#8217;t public. The New York-based bank also may consider how the rest of the industry reacts to Goldman Sachs&#8217;s decision before taking action, the person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which previously required bankers to get approval before they could trade individual securities, told employees about the change on Sept. 26, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said at the time. Banks monitor staff investments to prevent insider trading and to counter claims that they put the interests of employees ahead of clients. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s six years after the crisis and they are still facing continued litigation, so if you were in that foxhole wouldn&#8217;t you do something?&#8221; said Roy Smith, a finance professor at New York University&#8217;s Stern School of Business and a former Goldman Sachs partner. &#8220;You protect yourself by causing these restrictions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs changed its policy on the day that public radio and ProPublica reported the story of a former Federal Reserve Bank of New York examiner who secretly recorded her ex-colleagues&#8217; dealings with the New York-based bank. The examiner, Carmen Segarra, sued the New York Fed last year, alleging she was fired in 2012 because she refused to change her finding that Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t have a conflict-of-interest policy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Compliance Unit &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Citigroup&#8217;s current rules, amended in June, include a list of stocks that employees are forbidden from trading, according to Robert Julavits, a bank spokesman. Staff must seek approval from managers and the compliance unit to trade other stocks and bonds, and bankers are restricted from investing in securities or funds from the industries they cover, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Citigroup also requires managing directors and directors to disclose stakes they hold in companies that hire the bank, Julavits said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are always looking at ways to enhance our policies and procedures,&#8221; he said in an e-mailed statement. He declined to comment on the bank&#8217;s plans to review its policy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Bank of America Corp., the two largest U.S. banks, declined to comment, as did a representative of Morgan Stanley, owner of the world&#8217;s biggest brokerage. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Restricting Transactions &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co. &#8220;has long-standing policies and monitoring controls in place that require team members to obtain pre-approval for personal securities transactions&#8221; and may restrict trades if the company believes there could be a conflict, Elise Wilkinson, a bank spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2012, a Delaware judge rebuked Goldman Sachs over its &#8220;incomplete and inadequate&#8221; handling of a conflict of interest in pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Inc.&#8217;s $21.1 billion purchase of El Paso Corp., the investment bank&#8217;s biggest takeover assignment the previous year. Stephen D. Daniel, a former Goldman Sachs partner who was lead banker on the deal, failed to disclose ownership of about $340,000 in Kinder Morgan stock, the judge said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Dakin Campbell in New York at dcampbell27@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Eichenbaum at peichenbaum@bloomberg.net Dan Kraut &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will build data
centers in India to tap demand for cloud-based computing as it
plans to offer its Azure and Office 365 services in the world&#8217;s
second-most populous nation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azure, which lets businesses access computing resources and
run programs via the Internet, will be available from local data
centers by the end of 2015, Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella told reporters in New Delhi today. Office 365, a cloud-based subscription version of Microsoft&#8217;s productivity programs,
will be available at the same time, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing is a key part of Nadella&#8217;s plan to
transform Microsoft and retain relevance as consumers shift from
desktops to tablets and smartphones by keeping information
stored on remote servers instead of a local hard drives. The
world&#8217;s biggest software maker competes against rivals including
Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Google Inc. for clients in India, a market
expected to reach $1.7 billion by 2018 according to Gartner Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft&#8217;s cloud services in India have grown over 100
percent in revenue in the past year,&#8221; the company said in a
statement. &#8220;Microsoft&#8217;s locally available cloud services will
open opportunities for banking, financial services, and
insurance companies, state-owned enterprises and government
departments.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. are among firms selected to lead the initial
public offering of Japan Post Holdings Co. as the government
sells the country&#8217;s biggest savings institution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Finance also chose Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan
Stanley (MS) Securities Co. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. as the global
coordinators for the sale of the state-owned postal, banking and
insurance giant as soon as next year. Daiwa Securities Group
Inc., Citigroup Inc., UBS AG (UBSN) and four other brokerages will also
arrange the IPO, the ministry said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction could become one of Japan&#8217;s biggest IPOs as
the government implements privatization plans conceived by
former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi&#8217;s administration in the
previous decade. Firms leading the offering stand to reap the
highest fees by advising the ministry on how and when to sell
the shares in Japan and abroad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a gigantic deal,&#8221; said Kazumi Tanaka, an IPO
analyst at DZH Financial Research Inc. in Tokyo. &#8220;Obtaining the
mandate is lucrative because of the large fees and the
additional share sales and deals that would follow.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mizuho Securities Co. (8411) and SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. were
also selected to work on the IPO, along with Tokai Tokyo
Financial Holdings Inc. and Okasan Securities Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO), whose employee stock-compensation plan was called excessive by billionaire Warren Buffett and other investors, agreed to rein in the program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fewer shares will be issued to employees, and more
transparency will be provided into how the program works, the
Atlanta-based company said today in a statement. The number of
shares granted will be no more than 0.8 percent of total
outstanding stock in 2015 and an average of 0.4 percent for the
remainder of the plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola investor Wintergreen Advisers LLC, run by David
Winters, railed against the compensation plan this year, calling
it a &#8220;raw deal&#8221; for shareholders that was too generous and
diluted the stock. Buffett, Coca-Cola&#8217;s largest shareholder,
also spoke out against the program, though only after the plan
passed. He abstained from voting on it at Coca-Cola&#8217;s annual
meeting in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;By approving the equity plan in April, our shareowners
authorized the compensation committee to manage something
precious &#8211;- shares of the Coca-Cola company,&#8221; Maria Elena Lagomasino, chairman of Coca-Cola&#8217;s compensation committee,
wrote in a letter to shareholders today. &#8220;The existing equity
plan was designed to provide significant flexibility in how and
to whom long-term equity awards are made. These guidelines are
designed to be clear and simple, driven by our desire to enhance
transparency with our shareowners.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York City is partnering with International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) to create a website to help technology startup companies connect with investors, industry leaders and job applicants. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Called Digital.NYC, the portal will serve as a hub where entrepreneurs can find information and resources, Mayor Bill de Blasio said today at a press briefing in Brooklyn. The website includes job listings, a citywide database of more than 6,000 technology companies and investors, and an interactive calendar of events. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The site was built by New York-based Gust, a company whose web platform offers a way for startups to share information with angel investors. It uses Bluemix, IBM&#8217;s cloud technology. Digital.NYC was developed in collaboration with the New York City Economic Development Corp. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM Tries to Adapt. Again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is the first of its kind anywhere in the world, a public-private partnership to really bring all of the aspects of the industry together,&#8221; de Blasio said at the press briefing in the Dumbo section, home to some of New York&#8217;s newest startups. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The site uses data and content from technology and media companies including CourseHorse, WayWire.com, The Muse, Uncubed, AlleyWatch, General Assembly, Flatiron School, Meetup.com and the New York Daily News. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;De Blasio was joined by Robert LeBlanc, senior vice president of software and cloud solutions at Armonk, New York-based IBM, and Minerva Tantoco, who was named the city&#8217;s first chief technology officer last month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Digital.NYC expands on the city&#8217;s Made in NY Digital Map from 2012 and the We Are Made in NY campaign introduced in 2013.

&lt;p&gt;West Texas Intermediate crude may be
nearing a price floor because a move below $90 a barrel would
prompt some U.S. producers to reduce drilling, according to
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WTI futures traded near $92 a barrel today after plunging
13 percent in the three months ended yesterday, the U.S.
benchmark&#8217;s biggest quarterly drop in more than two years.
Prices are close to a level that would make production
unprofitable for some companies in higher-cost places such as
North Dakota, Goldman&#8217;s head of commodities research, Jeff Currie, said in London today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;U.S. producers may lay down rigs and slow production if
WTI keeps falling below $90,&#8221; Currie said in an interview
during the World Commodities Week conference. The potential for
oil prices to fall further is also &#8220;limited&#8221; because of
threats to supply, particularly in Libya, Currie said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs estimates that WTI will trade at about $90 a
barrel in three months, while Brent, the European benchmark,
rebounds to $100. Brent traded at about $95 a barrel on the ICE
Futures Europe exchange today in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The downside is limited, unless the economic situation
outside the U.S. deteriorates further,&#8221; Currie said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disappointing economic growth in China would mean that
Brent might miss the target, Currie said. Concern that China is
slowing, coupled with the strengthening U.S. dollar, sparked a
selloff across commodities yesterday that pulled oil lower, he
said. WTI fell 3.6 percent yesterday to $91.16 a barrel, the
biggest drop since November 2012, according to New York
Mercantile Exchange data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More Bearish &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The picture&#8217;s a tad more bearish,&#8221; Currie said. &#8220;Our
baseline view is an acceleration in demand into 2015 and
slightly lower production. My conviction in our baseline view is
waning with recent macro data.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s manufacturing remained subdued last month as the
world&#8217;s second-largest economy was weighed down by a property
slump. The government&#8217;s Purchasing Managers&#8217; Index (CPMINDX) was at 51.1
in September, the same as August&#8217;s reading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pullback in manufacturing, declining industrial profits,
and factory-output growth at a five-year low point to a
deepening economic slowdown. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg
predict China will expand 7 percent in 2015, the slowest pace
since 1990. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Supply Threats &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The political situation in Libya is one of the most
tenuous we&#8217;ve seen since unrest first erupted,&#8221; Currie said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holder of Africa&#8217;s biggest oil reserves remains divided
politically even as its production has tripled to 780,000
barrels a day last month from 250,000 a day in May, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Its internationally recognized
government shifted to the eastern city of al-Bayda and a
different administration allied with Islamist militias has
seized control of the capital, Tripoli. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nation&#8217;s production, currently at about 900,000 barrels
a day, was disrupted last month by protests at the Gialo field
and a rocket attack that damaged the Zawiya refinery, according
to Mohamed Elharari, a spokesman at National Oil Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You lose some of Libya, China shows an acceleration, you
get a slight reduction in Saudi Arabian production, and the
market would be back up to $100,&#8221; Currie said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest U.S. bank, said a previously disclosed data breach affected 76 million households and 7 million small businesses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Customer names, addresses, phone numbers and e-mail addresses were taken, the New York-based bank said today in a regulatory filing.

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest U.S. bank, today described the size of its previously disclosed data breach, ranking it among the year&#8217;s largest-known cyber-attacks. Here&#8217;s what customers need to know: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q. How big was the breach? A. JPMorgan estimated that data on 76 million households and 7 million small businesses were compromised, without identifying locations. For perspective, the U.S. had about 115 million households total as of 2012. The breach affected people who visited the firm&#8217;s websites, including Chase.com, or used its mobile app, said a person briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q. What information was taken? A. User contact information including names, phone numbers, addresses and e-mail addresses. Internal data identifying customers by category -- such as whether they&#8217;re clients of the mortgage, auto, credit-card or private-bank divisions -- also were exposed, the person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Graphic: Top U.S. Data Breaches&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q. What wasn&#8217;t taken? A. JPMorgan said there&#8217;s no evidence hackers stole account numbers, passwords, user IDs, dates of birth or Social Security numbers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q. Are hackers draining accounts, and is my money safe? A. JPMorgan said it hasn&#8217;t seen any unusual fraud linked to the breach. Customers aren&#8217;t liable for unauthorized transactions if the bank is promptly alerted, the company said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Internet Security&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q. What should I do to protect myself? A. Because account IDs and passwords weren&#8217;t compromised, JPMorgan said it isn&#8217;t necessary to obtain new credit or debit cards, change passwords or obtain identity or credit monitoring as a result of the incident. The firm said customers should alert it immediately if they spot suspicious transactions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q. What can hackers do with contact information? A. Phishing scams are typically the biggest risk, according to JPMorgan. That&#8217;s when criminals contact people and try to trick them into handing over account details or other sensitive information. The bank warned customers not to click links or download attachments on e-mails from unknown senders and to be wary of other suspicious communications. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Katia Dmitrieva in Toronto at edmitrieva1@bloomberg.net; Michael Riley in Washington at michaelriley@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Eichenbaum at peichenbaum@bloomberg.net; Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net David Scheer &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mercuria Energy Group Ltd.&#8217;s six-month-old agreement to buy JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s physical
commodities business for $3.5 billion was revised to cover only
$800 million of assets, according to people familiar with the
change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan plans to sell the rest of the business in separate
transactions, said the people, who asked not to be identified
because the final deal&#8217;s terms haven&#8217;t been made public. Some
separate sales have already been agreed, one person said. The
Wall Street Journal reported on the changes earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading houses such as Mercuria are filling the void as
banks from JPMorgan and Barclays Plc to Deutsche Bank AG and
Morgan Stanley (MS) withdraw from or scale back physical commodity
operations amid increased regulatory scrutiny of lenders owning,
storing and trading raw materials. Founded in 2004 by former
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. traders Marco Dunand and Daniel Jaeggi,
Mercuria has grown to become the world&#8217;s fourth-largest
independent commodity trader with 2013 revenue of $112 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the assets not being purchased by Mercuria include a
crude oil supply agreement to a refinery in St. Paul, Minnesota,
the refinery&#8217;s owner, Northern Tier Energy LP, said in a
regulatory filing last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Earnings Boost &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s physical commodity business, formerly led by
Blythe Masters, has previously generated annual operating profit
before compensation costs of $750 million, according to people
who have seen documents related to the unit&#8217;s sale. That would
bring Mercuria, which posted net income of $273 million last
year, closer to earnings achieved by competitors Vitol Group and
Trafigura Beheer BV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercuria competed with Macquarie Group Ltd. and Blackstone
Group LP to enter exclusive negotiations for the unit in
February, people with knowledge of the bidding said at the time.
The JPMorgan unit, put up for sale last year, was slated to give
Mercuria gas and power trading operations on both sides of the
Atlantic, physical assets spanning about 40 locations in North
America and 6 million barrels of storage leases in the Canadian
oil sands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercuria also gets Henry Bath  Sons Ltd., a 220-year-old
metal-warehouse operator based in Liverpool, England, that will
be operated as a stand-alone subsidiary separated from
Mercuria&#8217;s trading operations. Henry Bath was a founding member
of the London Metal Exchange, and handles products that include
aluminum, steel and copper as well as cocoa and coffee,
according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercuria, which is registered in Cyprus and has its main
trading operations in Geneva, offered jobs to about 200 people,
or about half of the unit&#8217;s staff, a person familiar with the
matter said in March. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s most
valuable crude producer, signed an agreement with Petroleos
Mexicanos as Mexico&#8217;s oil industry opens to private investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon and Pemex, as the state-owned producer is known,
signed a three-year memorandum of understanding and cooperation
to exchange academic, scientific and technical knowledge,
according to e-mailed statements by both companies. The
companies agreed to analyze exploration, drilling and refining
opportunities, according to Pemex&#8217;s statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Irving, Texas-based company joins a growing list of
major oil producers to express interest in entering Mexico&#8217;s
energy industry, which is ending a 76-year state oil monopoly.
Congress passed legislation last year to allow private companies
to tap the country&#8217;s 13.4 billion barrels of proven reserves,
which the government estimates will bring in $50 billion of

&lt;p&gt;A 4-foot-tall robot with a video screen for a head swerves past an orange couch and bumps into the wall of a conference room. A few feet away, an engineer tests a virtual reality headset that can allow a coffee-shop owner to forecast hot-chocolate sales during a blizzard. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is Visa Inc.&#8217;s new outpost in San Francisco -- part executive office, part design laboratory and entirely the brainchild of Charlie Scharf, Visa&#8217;s chief executive officer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scharf, who this July day had unveiled the latest version of the company&#8217;s digital wallet, is sitting in an office overlooking San Francisco Bay one floor above the lab. He&#8217;s wearing jeans, loafers and a gray shirt with no tie. One leg is propped up on his desk. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moving into the heart of the city, 23 miles (37 kilometers) from Visa&#8217;s suburban headquarters in Foster City, California, and three blocks from a Google Inc. office, is a statement about how Scharf is seeking to embrace the new technologies transforming the way consumers make payments, Bloomberg Markets will report in its November issue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More from the November issue of Bloomberg Markets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have to think and act much more like a technology company than we have before,&#8221; Scharf says a few weeks later at a restaurant in Sag Harbor, New York, where he&#8217;s on vacation with his family. &#8220;The payments world is changing. There are new entrants, new opportunities for people to get into our business and other opportunities for us to grow our business in ways that didn&#8217;t exist before.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s board found a way
to keep Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger in place
until 2018 while maximizing the chances the internal candidates
most likely to succeed him stick around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, yesterday extended
Iger&#8217;s contract by two years to June 2018. The move keeps in
place a manager who has spearheaded high-profile acquisitions
like Marvel, turned around the company&#8217;s historic animation
business and tripled Disney&#8217;s stock price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the company has decided to name a chief
operating officer next year -- and that executive, most likely
coming from within, would be Iger&#8217;s heir apparent, according to
a person close to the company. Giving a time frame to the
internal candidates, Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo and
Parks  Resorts Chairman Thomas Staggs, makes them less likely
to bolt before a decision is made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s no doubt Bob Iger has been performing at an
outstanding level,&#8221; said William Simon, an executive recruiter
who heads the entertainment industry practice at Korn Ferry (KFY) in
Los Angeles. &#8220;Asking a potential successor to wait four years
could prove to be difficult.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said in a filing today that Iger could earn a
retention bonus of $60 million if Disney&#8217;s operating income
increases to a cumulative $78.3 billion for the five years
ending in September 2018. He will earn a smaller bonus if that
number tops $76 billion. For the year that ended in September
2013, the company generated operating income of $10.7 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. is hiring
just one JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) metals trader as the Swiss trading
house pares back its purchase of the New York-based bank&#8217;s
commodity unit, three people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Berchole will trade aluminum, nickel and tin for
Mercuria in London, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the matter is private. Mercuria will pay
about $800 million for part of the JPMorgan assets, less than
the $3.5 billion cited by the bank when it announced the deal
for the whole unit in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Mercuria won&#8217;t buy most of JPMorgan&#8217;s metals business
and inventories or its two crude-supply contracts for U.S.
refineries, the bank still expects to recoup $3.5 billion for
the commodities unit by selling assets to other parties, two
people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under pressure from regulators concerned about lenders
owning, storing and trading raw materials, banks including
JPMorgan, Barclays Plc and Deutsche Bank AG are withdrawing from
or scaling back their commodity businesses. Independent trading
houses such as Mercuria, which have less direct oversight by
regulators, are filling the void. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick Burton, a spokesman for JPMorgan in London,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercuria last month hired former Trafigura Beheer BV
executive Tristan Busch to run its refined metals and
concentrates business from Geneva. The company is looking to add
copper traders in North America and Europe, one of the people
said. The trading house&#8217;s metals business in China is managed by
James Jian Wu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Crude Contracts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s contract to supply crude oil to the Philadelphia
Energy Solutions refinery in Pennsylvania won&#8217;t be transferred
to Mercuria, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A separate crude-supply agreement to a refinery in St.
Paul, Minnesota, also won&#8217;t go to Mercuria, the plant&#8217;s owner,
Northern Tier Energy LP, said in a regulatory filing last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercuria will secure JPMorgan&#8217;s gas and power trading
operations in North American and Europe, the assets it most
covets, one of the people said. It will also buy more than a
dozen physical assets in North America, including about 6
million barrels of storage leases in the Canadian oil sands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercuria, which has its main trading operations in Geneva,
also gets Henry Bath  Sons Ltd., a 220-year-old metal-warehouse
operator based in Liverpool, England, which will be operated as
a stand-alone subsidiary. Henry Bath was a founding member of
the London Metal Exchange, and handles products that include
aluminum, steel and copper as well as cocoa and coffee,
according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloem S.A.S.U. of Cannes, France, is
offering a service for patent-seekers that theoretically might
enable them to expand the number and reach of their patent
claims through the use of natural language processing
algorithms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloem said on its website that it combines human claim-drafting expertise with computational linguistics to create what
it calls &#8220;technical poems&#8221; -- cloems, for short -- patent
claims that are both human and machine creations. The company
said it uses dictionaries and ontologies, and more than 100
proprietary claim-drafting algorithms, to create these claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The computer-generated claims can be published to keep
potential competitors from attempting to file adjacent patent
claims, Cloem said. The cloems can potentially be prior art used
to invalidate others&#8217; claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s website didn&#8217;t identify any people who make
up Cloem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are a team of passionate patent engineers and computer
linguistics scientists,&#8221; it said. &#8220;Our exact names are not
disclosed for now, because we want to remain focused on the
development of our technology and avoid external

&lt;h2&gt;PepsiCo Seeks Patent for Granola Bars Containing Fizzy Candy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PepsiCo Inc. (PEP), the world&#8217;s biggest snack-food maker, is
working on granola bars with embedded carbonated candy,
according to a new patent application. The company gives Pop
Rocks as an example of carbonated candy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Application 20140272009 describes chewy products comprised
of cold-formed sheets of granola that either incorporating or
coated with particles of carbonated candy. The candy is made
from tiny sugar crystals containing highly pressurized carbon
dioxide and low percentages of water, Purchase, New York-based
PepsiCo said in its application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caffeine is among the ingredients the granola base can
contain, as well as nuts, fruits, seeds, grains and honey.
PepsiCo said the carbonated candy will create a bubbling
sensation comparable to drinking a fizzy beverage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The candy is in a moisture-impervious coating to prevent
premature popping, according to the application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PepsiCo applied for the patent in March 2013. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trademarks for Cord Auto Offered for Private Sale, Auction &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leake Auction Co. of Tulsa, Oklahoma, will be selling the
trademarks related to the Cord automobile, the company said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office, two &#8220;Cord&#8221; trademarks are registered to the Auburn-Cord-Dusenberg Co. of Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. One is for toy
cars and the other is for original and replacement parts for
antique cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The auction house said the two trademarks for sale had
belonged to the late Glenn Pray of Broken Arrow. His family is
now selling them. Pray sold the Dusenberg mark for $500,000, the
auction house said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original Cord, which had its debut in 1929, was the
first front-wheel drive car in the U.S., according to the Car 
Driver website. It sold for about $3,000 and was available in
several models, including one intended to be chauffeur-driven.
The Hemmings car-collector website lists antique Cord vehicles
for sale for as much as $225,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The auction company said the two trademarks are available
separately as private sales through Oct. 22. After that, they
will be removed from the market and offered at the Leake
Collector Car Show  Auction in Dallas on Nov. 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coca-Cola Defeats $100 Million Infringement Claim Over Coke Zero &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO) prevailed in a trademark suit brought by a
now-defunct Illinois producer of bottled water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit was filed in Illinois federal court in 2008, with
Mirza Baig and his Blue Springs Water Co. seeking $100 million
in damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baig said Coca-Cola stole his idea to sell Zero-brand no-calorie soft drinks and claimed that Coke Zero and Sprite Zero
infringed. He said he approached the Atlanta-based soda giant
about buying his business and the overture was rejected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had filed an application in 1997 to register &#8220;Naturally
Zero&#8221; as a trademark.  That application was initially refused.
After Baig amended it, he was refused again in 2005, according
to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Sept. 24 ruling, the court said there was no evidence
in the record that Baig&#8217;s Naturally Zero water &#8220;ever held any
significant share of the market for bottled water or soft
drinks.&#8221; Baig also failed to present any consumer testimony,
surveys or evidence of intentional copying, the court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court ruled that Baig and Blue Springs abandoned the
trademark application, and dismissed his claim against Coca-Cola. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baig also said Coca-Cola infringed his Canadian trademark.
The court relinquished jurisdiction over that claim and
dismissed it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Baig v. Coca-Cola Co., 08-cv-04206, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Copyrights &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abacus Fee Award in InDyne Case Was Proper, Court Rules &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;InDyne Inc., a Virginia-based military contractor, must pay
$600,000 in attorney fees to Abacus Technology Corp., a federal
appeals court ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The award was made in February by a Florida court after
InDyne failed in its copyright suit against Chevy Chase,
Maryland-based Abacus. InDyne, which had claimed the copyright
to its Program Information Management Software was infringed,
appealed the fee award. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Sept. 24 ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
11th Circuit said the award was proper. The court said InDyne
failed to bring adequate evidence of infringement, and the
company&#8217;s decision to sue &#8220;without proof of an element of its
prima facie case was objectively unreasonable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeal is Indyne Inc. v. Abacus Technology Corp.,
14-11058, U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. The lower
court case is Indyne Inc. v. Abacus Technology Corp, 11-cv-00137, U.S. District Court, Middle District of Florida
(Orlando). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News interview with Igor Sechin, chief executive officer of OAO Rosneft, the world&#8217;s largest publicly traded oil producer by output, conducted Sept. 26 on a research vessel on the Kara Sea. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On exploration in Russia&#8217;s Arctic Kara Sea: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The drilling at the structure Universitetskaya-1 is of exceptional significance, showing that Western Siberian deposits continue into the Arctic.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is the world&#8217;s northernmost oil well, the northernmost project in the history of global oil and gas, with unique demands on technology and ecology.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have fulfilled all our goals and the results even exceeded our expectations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The drilling of a vertical exploration well that reached a depth of 2,113 meters, testing, logging operations, core samples, their study, gives us the ability after an initial study to confirm that on the basis of this first structure, Universitetskaya, a new field has been found -- oil and gas condensate, as we say, with roughly the following resources: about 340 billion cubic meters of natural gas and over 100 million metric tons of oil. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;&#8216;That is almost a billion barrels of oil.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;Our first result was very successful. And we want to call this deposit Victory.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the commercial potential of the discovery at Universitetskaya: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;We of course have to go through registration, additional studies, appraisals to confirm this resource base. As soon as we do this -- it will be done over the next several months - we will put this field in our books. And, naturally, they will be commercial reserves by that point and they will boost the company&#8217;s capitalization. Just think: we put this resource base in our accounts, on the company&#8217;s balance sheet -- and of course the company&#8217;s shares will grow.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think we will orient the market based on our models. The minimum timeframe is five years, the general timeframe is seven years. I repeat, it all depends on the situation in the market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Oil production will start here in about seven years. But if the market wants it from us faster -- we can accelerate it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On oil price estimates: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mature oil fields in use around the world are declining, and this oil is high quality so the market should definitely give us the kind of price that justifies our investments. I think in five to seven years we will be talking about $140, $150 per barrel. But time will tell.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The oil we found, by its chemical parameters, is similar to Siberian Light. This is premium oil and it will cost more than Urals, about as much as Brent I think. All our investments will be justified in any case.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On strategy if Exxon Mobil is forced to halt work in the Kara Sea: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;If Exxon is forced to stop its work, it does not mean that we will no longer cooperate with Exxon.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Of course we will do it on our own and attract the necessary technologies and different partners who don&#8217;t have limitations on cooperation. But, as I said, we won&#8217;t stop working with Exxon. The project&#8217;s operator is our joint venture with Exxon and we&#8217;re not planning on changing the venture&#8217;s ownership structure.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;They will always have the possibility of returning to the project, as soon as the regulatory bodies allow.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are in contact with our American partners. There are exchanges on all levels including our legal department and other units. And of course we discussed these questions and we will act in strict compliance with the regulatory demands placed on the company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We plan to work next season. As I said, now we have drilled only the first structure -- at Universitetskaya. There are more than 30. We will continue working no matter what. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;We&#8217;ll continue drilling here next year and the years after that.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;We&#8217;re going to take into consideration all aspects of the law, but the market will be our guide. Market relations are more multi-polar and provide us with more opportunities. Any oil and gas company would be interested in the resources that we confirmed today. This work will be absolutely in demand from the market. Those who want to collaborate will work with us. Absolutely.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the possibility of new partners in the Kara Sea project: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;Unlike politicians, corporations act on the basis of contracts. The contract for the development of the deposits in the Kara Sea is signed by Rosneft and Exxon. It seems to me that&#8217;s enough for understanding. Here in the Kara Sea, we work through our operating company in which the shareholders are Rosneft and Exxon. There isn&#8217;t anyone else there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On sanctions: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Any restrictions make both work and life more difficult. And everyone suffers from sanctions. The biggest mistake is that sanctions moved from the political level to the corporate. This significantly expands the list of parties in this conflict. The biggest problem is that it destroys the foundations of the legal system and market relationships. Our work is based on fulfillment of the contract. If it is impossible to challenge a contract violation in court, then it practically annuls the independence of courts. And it is not my place to explain that destroying the foundations of law and market economics ultimately undermines everyone&#8217;s well being. It&#8217;s necessary to think about this. &#1054;f course I hope it will be resolved and after some time we will have the ability to work normally.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On rising costs: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I want to remind you that, by its production and financial results, Rosneft is one of the leaders of the global oil and gas industry. We have the best resource base -- our reserves by Russian classifications are 122 billion barrels of oil equivalent. We are first in reserves growth. We have one of the best production costs. In short, even by this measure we have the best position in the world at $4.5-$5 a barrel. I won&#8217;t name other companies but for comparison I will say that, for other leaders, costs can be at $15, $16 a barrel.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On access to capital, liquidity, development plans: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are generating very good liquidity which, by public reports, is about $18 billion. These resources allow us to continue to work normally.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Money never hurts. We have many projects. The company has 48 licenses on the Russian offshore and 35 international projects. We are participating in projects in the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska and Canada, off the coast of Vietnam and so on. That scale of work creates a new synergy. Of course, additional sources of financing would help develop all directions of our business. The financial condition in which the company is in and the financial resources that we have allows the company to work in any condition. Some projects we probably will move to the side and start to realize them a bit later. But current operations, debt service, we will handle without any problems.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On debt service: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have enough liquidity to service current credit lines. You have oriented yourself only on what is on balance but we are continuing to work and generate cash every day.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the dividend outlook: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Of course, absolutely. We are paying dividends to our shareholders. There is no problem. This is our sacred obligation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On borrowing from the Russian Government: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are not depending on government support to settle our debts. Our request concerning debt issuance is meant to help with the realization of our company&#8217;s new projects.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is the Far East Petrochemicals Plant, a number of new fields in East Siberia, infrastructure. This concerns only new projects.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The support will be determined by the resources of the budget and the plans of the government. If that comes about, that means we will continue developing all our projects. I remind you that we are the largest tax payer in our country. This year we will contribute 3 trillion rubles to budget revenue. In connection with this, the sum that we are asking for, not for capitalization but for debt -- loans -- is much less than we annually contribute to the budget. I think our request has grounds.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the cost of funding for Rosneft: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our company does not at this stage need any urgent loans or financial resources. So we are working in line with our standards. But in the market as a whole there is now a deficit of funds and their cost has increased of course. Some time in the future, it will increase for us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;But we have created reserves and taken measures to optimize our spending: we have also a plan for localization of production on service materials, including technological equipment, these measures will be directed at lowering our costs. So in some sense you could say that sanctions have helped us with a number of decisions that will cut costs.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On plan to buy Morgan Stanley&#8217;s oil trading unit: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;I want to talk about our intentions. They are unchanged, and we are in contact with Morgan Stanley. But, as the saying goes, &#8216;man proposes, God disposes.&#8217; Clearly, the contradictory position of the American regulators doesn&#8217;t allow us to say with any certainty that we will close this deal. On one hand, the regulators demanded that Morgan Stanley sell this business. Morgan Stanley found a buyer. And now the regulator won&#8217;t allow the buyer to conclude this deal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a contradiction here. Of course we are confused by this tendency. And of course we would like to complete this deal. It isn&#8217;t closed yet, the issue isn&#8217;t closed, and we will continue working to get a positive result. But for now our hands are tied by the decision of the U.S. regulatory bodies that are still conducting a review.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a commercially viable project for us and for Morgan Stanley. That&#8217;s all that I want to say. We&#8217;re able to carry it out once we get the necessary approvals and we&#8217;re continuing to work on it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Rosneft&#8217;s strategy: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our strategy is aimed at getting maximum efficiency at all stages and in all elements of our work. We&#8217;re sometimes criticized for having the government as our controlling shareholder. The character of ownership does not impact efficiency, the exacting work of management, professionalism, perseverance, decency, the use of new technologies. That&#8217;s what affects efficiency. And we, of course, will aim to boost efficiency.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We know what we need. We&#8217;re now creating our own oil services, there&#8217;s a deficit of such a service on the Russian market, we&#8217;re implementing a strong gas program. And if earlier we weren&#8217;t able to monetize gas that we have in our resource base, now we&#8217;re stepping up this business. And here we also see serious potential.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Rosneft&#8217;s place in the Russian market: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our own resource base is sufficient for the work of our company, for conducting geological exploration for more than 20 years. Moreover, aside from mergers and acquisitions, which are normal for an international market, the company is showing powerful organic growth. We&#8217;re boosting efficiency of output and not just making acquisitions. We&#8217;ll be working with those market offers that we receive. But, as I said, our own resource base is sufficient for implementation of the work for more than 20 years. So it&#8217;s not seen as some super-task. That&#8217;s not an issue.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On state control: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The type of ownership isn&#8217;t a key factor, the company&#8217;s efficiency on the market is. And in the case of our company, the presence of the state as a controlling shareholder allows us to get licenses to work on the shelf without lots of competition. Because only Gazprom and Rosneft, according to Russian law, have an opportunity to work on the shelf. I think for our shareholders this is a blessing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Gosneft nationalization: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s impossible. It is simply impossible. There are companies, their shareholders, there are obligations to partners. Rosneft is an international public company, whose shares belong to the biggest corporations, funds. BP owns 19.5 percent of our shares. Our stock trades on the London Stock Exchange. We comply with all the rules. So you can&#8217;t do that. So it&#8217;s impossible. Theoretically impossible.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On OAO Bashneft: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;If we worked in the Academy of Sciences, then we could debate theoretical problems like &#8216;Is there life on Mars?&#8217; I take a more grounded position. If no one has made us such an offer, then we don&#8217;t consider it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the risks of privatization and Bashneft: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I want to congratulate shareholders of Rosneft that Rosneft didn&#8217;t acquire anything during privatization. That&#8217;s why our company doesn&#8217;t have such risks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;The market knew about Bashneft&#8217;s problems. It was known that there are privatization risks, there are risks of tax claims, there is a criminal trail. The market has known about the skeletons in the closet for a long time. I think that is precisely why we never considered buying this asset. But Vladimir Petrovich Evtushenkov is a very wise man, an experienced entrepreneur. I think he has weighed all of these risks when deciding to buy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;But I think it&#8217;s appropriate to recall the idiom that &#8216;free cheese is only found in a mousetrap&#8217;. I hope that this issue will be also resolved lawfully. In turn, we continue to work with Sistema. It is our telecommunication operator. We get logistics and infrastructure support from them. We cooperate with a bank that is a part of AFK Sistema. This cooperation is beneficial and mutually profitable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Evtushenkov: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Evtushenkov doesn&#8217;t have blood on his hands. And this, at a minimum, is a very important fact. He is a businessman, a big businessman. Everybody has problems. But he is not a criminal. He never eliminated his competitors, and that was a practice at Yukos.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are court verdicts: killers were found, murders were proved. Some of these killers got life sentences. Therefore, there are completely different circumstances and different grounds. It&#8217;s impossible to compare.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Sechin&#8217;s alleged role in the Evtushenkov arrest: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a myth. In general, I recommend you not rely on rumors and focus on the facts. There are special people who work with rumors. Positive rumors can boost capitalization of the company, negative rumors can reduce it. For business people, this is a way to make money. If you look at those who have been buying shares of Bashneft during this volatile period you can make conclusions without me as to who is spreading these rumors and why. Some agencies have a method: distraction with a red herring, and in this case the red herring is me.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Croatian privatizations and INA: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Risks regarding privatizations aren&#8217;t only in our country. They happen in other countries, including European ones. And possibly one of the most striking examples is linked to the sale of Croatia&#8217;s share in the company INA. There, they have dealt with the situation. No one is saying that this situation has destroyed the investment climate in Croatia. Just the opposite, some heads of state bodies are held, investigations are continuing. And this market is considered highly transparent, lawful and safe for business. I think it&#8217;s necessary to treat this situation this way.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On privatization: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m not saying privatization results should be reviewed. What I&#8217;m saying is if there is corruption we have to fight it, like it&#8217;s being done around the world, and not to accuse law-enforcement agencies of wrongdoing. That&#8217;s it. It&#8217;s nothing scary that there is a fight against corruption.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On corruption: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I believe the struggle against corruption is under way. Businesses feel its effects. Rosneft is no exception. We do not pay money to anyone. And no one has asked us for it. We wouldn&#8217;t have paid anyway as all our money is accounted for.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Sechin&#8217;s future as Rosneft&#8217;s CEO: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s a very interesting question for me. There were periods in my life when I engaged in totally different activities. But in recent years, especially when I was with the government, I&#8217;ve been focusing on the energy sector. Now I&#8217;m trying to use the expertise I gained, hopefully to the benefit of Rosneft. My contract with Rosneft expires in May next year. What does that mean? It means that I&#8217;m a hired manager and so it&#8217;s impossible to say that for me this will last forever. I&#8217;m a hired manager and find the job interesting.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The decision is up to the shareholders, who may make different offers. But if an offer is made to me, I will think it over.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On his attitude toward the possibility of becoming prime minister: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I work where I work. I find my work interesting. The government is headed by a respected prime minister with immense experience.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We need this bond borrowing. And we have asked Dmitry Anatolievich Medvedev to support this proposal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On sanction retaliation, including seizure of foreign assets in Russia: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sanctions and counter-sanctions are very harmful ideas that pull a large number of subjects, companies and individuals into the conflict. That&#8217;s very damaging for everyone. I am opposed to both sanctions and counter-sanctions. I advocate cooperation and friendship.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On cooperation with foreign oil and gas companies: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are open to cooperation. Russia&#8217;s oil and gas sector is 25 percent owned by foreign companies. There&#8217;s nothing unusual about that. We have been inviting partners. We have been seeking to swap assets. This strategy has helped stabilize our position in the market, ensure transparency and mutual interests. That&#8217;s the right thing to do. We have been dealing with Chinese, as well as U.S., Italian, Indian and Japanese companies. We are not in for any kind of collusion, we follow open-market principles. We are open to all cooperation proposals.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On sanctions and Russian asset seizures abroad: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Everyone should respect the law and hold oneself financially responsible. That&#8217;s all. If a business is lawful, I wish everyone success, progress and new acquisitions. Yet one should hold oneself financially responsible. There should be compliance -- I insist -- with applicable laws and principles.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;When I buy shares I hold myself financially responsible. If I have the money and chance to attract resources, I do that. Well, I hope everybody does that. If buying is allowed, it means it is not in any way forbidden. If you have lawful funds for that, then there is no problem. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;I have no assets abroad. All my assets are based in Russia. If somebody has the need or the desire, why stop him? Let them work. They must only observe the law.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the failure of Communism: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;Communist ideology made all people the same. But all people are different. And the ideology discouraged people from taking action. God made us all different and that should be kept in mind. Some people are active at work, others seek to be creative. There are also those who want to lie under a palm tree waiting for a banana to fall. Well, those principles of equality discourage active people. Active people are more useful to society and I think their contribution to social development should prompt understanding that they can afford something for themselves with their lawfully earned money. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;God willing, I wish all of them good health, luck, wellbeing and wealth.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On personal sanctions: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;I was banned from visiting the U.S. This limits my ability to work with American partners, limits opportunities to work with enterprises, to familiarize myself with technology, to visit deposits, to gain experience. Of course, I suffered from the sanctions but they did not affect my finances because I don&#8217;t have any assets in the U.S., nor anywhere else abroad. And of course they deprive me of creative development.This is simply unjust. I have nothing to do with the conflicts. I was not involved in decision making. That&#8217;s why this is groundless.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On whether he&#8217;d ask President Vladimir Putin to change policy on Ukraine due to sanctions: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;Russian President Vladimir Putin is a very busy man. He has a huge, difficult job. I wish him all the best. I am watching what he&#8217;s doing with hope. First of all, I have neither the ability nor the right to try to distract him from his work. Secondly, he will never let himself be pressured into making a decision, as far as I know him. No use even trying. That&#8217;s all I have to say about it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the economic implications for Russia of Arctic discovery: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Developing offshore projects is a capital intensive business that implies a huge multiplying effect for the economy. Every dollar invested in offshore development generates $7.70 in other sectors of the economy. To me, this is a key aspect that justifies support for offshore projects. Undoubtedly, it will boost economic growth and the construction of new ports, infrastructure, airports, equipment and sea platforms. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;There are 34 oil and gas structures in the Kara Sea alone, as I said. A drilling platform should be installed at each structure. All this work should be done. This is work that should give a boost to major spheres of the economy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;I&#8217;ve already made parallels with the nuclear or space programs. The strategic development of offshore oil fields will be more important than the projects I mentioned. The multiplication effect will be much higher. This includes the production of sea-floor equipment, the production of power equipment. It requires metals, ports, aircraft, helicopters and vessels. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;Undoubtedly, these projects will have a multiplying effect on Russia but also our partners in the West and East.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Ilya Arkhipov in Moscow at iarkhipov@bloomberg.net; Stephen Bierman in Moscow at sbierman1@bloomberg.net; Ryan Chilcote in London at rchilcote@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editors responsible for this story: Balazs Penz at bpenz@bloomberg.net Tony Halpin, Torrey Clark &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hackers exploited an employee password to crack a JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) server and ultimately pull off one of the largest cyber-attacks ever, accessing data on 76 million households and 7 million small businesses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, outlined the scope of the previously disclosed breach yesterday, reassuring clients there&#8217;s still no evidence account numbers and passwords were compromised, even as names and contact data were exposed. People who logged on to certain websites or mobile apps had contact information stolen, the New York-based company said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bank has been struggling to head off damage since the incident, first reported by Bloomberg News in August. New details on how attackers accomplished the feat over months, including their initial entry, were provided by two people briefed on the investigation, who requested anonymity because it&#8217;s private. JPMorgan said the threat now is phishing, in which criminals try to trick people into handing over more valuable data, such as user IDs and passwords. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Internet Security&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If they find the CEO of a company, they know this person&#8217;s worth a lot of money, they would try to attack that person,&#8221; said Jeff Tjiputra, program chairman for Cybersecurity at the University of Maryland University College. Still, &#8220;it&#8217;s not an easy hack or scam.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. says it&#8217;s
losing confidence in its forecast that Brent crude will recover
to $100 a barrel next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Wall Street bank is maintaining its projection
for now, it says that a lack of signs of accelerating global
economic growth and uncertainty over OPEC&#8217;s production plans
amid rising Libyan output are weakening its conviction. Brent,
the benchmark for more than half the world&#8217;s oil, closed at
$93.42 a barrel yesterday, the lowest in more than two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices slumped as U.S. crude production climbed last month
to the highest level since 1986 and the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped the most oil in a year. The
International Energy Agency cut its projections for global
consumption growth through next year due to a weakening economic
outlook while Saudi Arabia lowered prices this week, signaling
the world&#8217;s biggest exporter is prepared to let them fall rather
than cede market share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given the lack of strong catalyst for higher prices, the
path of least resistance seems for further declines,&#8221; Goldman
analysts including New York-based Jeffrey Currie said in an e-mailed report. &#8220;However, the downside from here starts to
become limited as further declines in Brent prices would help
rebalance the oil market, incentivizing stronger demand growth
and weighing on production growth in the U.S.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent for November delivery was 39 cents higher at $93.81 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, at 3:29
p.m. Singapore time. Futures plunged 16 percent in the three
months to Sept. 30, the worst quarterly performance since June
2012. They have declined 15.3 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WTI Spread &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark grade, for
November delivery was at $91.52 a barrel in electronic trading
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, bringing its decline this
year to 7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WTI&#8217;s discount to Brent shrank to $2.41 yesterday based on
settlement prices, the smallest since August 2013. The spread is
&#8220;far too narrow given logistic economics&#8221; and needs to
&#8220;widen,&#8221; Goldman said in its report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this level, the spread will boost U.S. imports,
increasing inventories on the Gulf Coast and at Cushing,
Oklahoma, the delivery point for WTI, Goldman said. The bank
forecasts the difference will rebound to $10 a barrel in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s conviction in its 2015 Brent forecast is waning
due to &#8220;lack of tangible signs of sequential acceleration&#8221; in
global economic growth, including in China, during the second
half of 2014, it said in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economists have cut estimates for this year&#8217;s gross
domestic product growth in China after data on industrial
profits, factory output and credit showed a deteriorating
outlook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Asian nation will account for about 11 percent of
global oil demand this year, compared with 21 percent for the
U.S., forecasts from the IEA in Paris show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Brent Recovery &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chance of a price recovery to Goldman&#8217;s $100 forecast
for 2015 may also be capped if longer-term prices, which have
risen this year, catch up with the slide in prompt contracts,
the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Stabilizing geopolitical risk and growing perception of a
demand-constrained oil market could well combine to reverse some
of this remaining $4 a barrel year-to-date rally in five-year
forward Brent prices,&#8221; it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent&#8217;s decline probably isn&#8217;t sustainable, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. On the weekly chart, the relative strength
index has dropped to 27.4, the lowest level since June 2012,
when futures fell to an 18-month low of less than $90 a barrel.
Readings below 30 typically signal a market is oversold and may
rebound. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said in a patent
lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co. that the South Korean
smartphone maker paid it as much as $1 billion in royalties last
year under a now-disputed 2011 licensing agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The payment was disclosed for the first time in a court
filing in Microsoft&#8217;s complaint alleging Samsung breached an
agreement to share patents. The seven-year accord requires
Samsung to pay Microsoft royalties for phones and tablets that
use the software maker&#8217;s patented technology, according to the
filing yesterday in Manhattan federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung has refused to pay $6.9 million in interest owed
under the agreement, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Samsung has suggested that Microsoft has breached the
business collaboration agreement,&#8221; David Howard, Microsoft&#8217;s
deputy general counsel, said yesterday in a blog post. &#8220;We
disagree, and that&#8217;s why we asked the court to rule that
Microsoft is not in breach.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft claims Samsung is using Microsoft&#8217;s acquisition
of Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)&#8217;s phone business as an excuse to stop complying
with the contract. The license agreement contains explicit
provisions that grant a patent license to both companies&#8217;
subsidiaries, including Nokia, Microsoft said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
