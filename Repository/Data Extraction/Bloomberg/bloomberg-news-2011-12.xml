<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE)''s advanced kidney cancer
treatment may not be effective at prolonging the time some
patients live without the disease getting worse, a Food and Drug
Administration staff report said today. </p>
<p>The FDA said it was concerned that the number of U.S.
patients who benefited from the therapy, chemically known as
axitinib, was small. People who showed the most response were
first treated with medicines known as cytokines, which are not
used as much as newer treatments. </p>
<p>Advice is sought on whether the issue of survival free
from disease progression is being driven by a subset of
patients that is likely to be scarce in the United States,
according to the report. </p>
<p>The medicine from New York-based Pfizer, the world''s
biggest drugmaker, may compete with tivozanib from Aveo
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (AVEO) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which is also
being tested to treat advanced kidney cancer. Both block
receptors in the body thought to play a role in spreading
tumors. Kidney cancer affects 296,000 people in the U.S.,
according to the American Cancer Society. </p>
<p>An advisory panel is scheduled to meet on axitinib Dec. 7
and make recommendations to the agency on the risks and benefits
of the treatment. The FDA isn''t required to follow the panel''s
advice. </p>
<p>Pfizer fell less than 1 percent to $19.84 at the close in
New York. The shares have gained 13 percent this year. </p>
<p>More than a third of patients in the trial had received
cytokines. </p>
<p>Kidney Cancer Treatments </p>
<p>Typical kidney cancer treatments, according to the National
Institutes of Health, include surgery to remove part of all of
the kidney, radiation, chemotherapy and other drugs such as
Bayer AG (BAYN)''s Nexavar. Pfizer compared axitinib to Nexavar, which
the FDA approved in 2005, in its final-phase clinical trial. </p>
<p>Results indicate that axitinib has demonstrated a
statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement
in efficacy compared with Nexavar, Pfizer said in the report
that it will present to the advisory panel Dec. 7. </p>
<p>The trial found axitinib kept the disease from progressing
for a median of 6.7 months compared with 4.7 months for Nexavar,
according to results released in June. The study included 723
patients. The FDA is expected to decide whether to approve
Pfizer''s drug by March 13. </p>

<p>Visa Inc., the world''s biggest bank-
card network, agreed to help develop Rwanda''s payments system
and connect the African nation''s 11 million citizens to the
global economy as the firm pushes to boost non-U.S. revenue. (V) </p>
<p>The company will modernize the nation''s payments network
under an accord with the government, working with partners to
upgrade automated teller machines, install merchant card
readers, develop e-commerce capabilities and provide financial
education, said Elizabeth Buse, Visa''s group president
responsible for most business outside the Americas. </p>
<p>It''s absolutely critical that you start with the
government if you are going to have the full pyramid of payments
services, Buse, 50, said in a phone interview. Our intent is
to take what we are doing in Rwanda and repeat it across other
developing economies, she said. </p>
<p>The project may help Chief Executive Officer Joseph W. Saunders, 66, fulfill his goal of generating more than half of
Visa''s revenue outside the U.S. by 2015. Last month, the company
announced a plan to create prepaid accounts linked to mobile
phones across Africa and the Middle East as it aims to capture
transactions from so-called unbanked consumers. </p>
<p>Visa chose Rwanda, where 86 percent of the population lacks
access to traditional financial services, because of its
friendliness toward private enterprise, stable regulatory
structure and smaller population, Buse said. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE)''s Wyeth unit and Teva
Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. were accused by a group of prescription
drug retailers of illegally keeping a generic version of the
Effexor XR antidepressant off the market. </p>
<p>Wyeth engaged in an overarching anticompetitive scheme to
prevent and delay the approval and marketing of generic versions
of Effexor XR, the retailers, including Walgreen Co. (WAG) and
Kroger Co. (KR), said in a complaint filed Nov. 30 in federal court
in Trenton, New Jersey. </p>
<p>The retailers allege that Wyeth fraudulently obtained
patents and engaged in sham litigation to delay generic
versions of the extended release drug. They also alleged that
Wyeth and the U.S. unit of Israel-based Teva Pharmaceuticals
Industries Ltd. colluded to keep Teva (TEVA)''s generic version off the
market until June 2010. </p>
<p>Joan Campion, a spokeswoman for New York-based Pfizer, and
Denise Bradley, a spokeswoman for Teva North America, didn''t
immediately return calls seeking comment on the lawsuit after
regular business hours Dec. 1. </p>
<p>The case is Walgreen v. Wyeth, 11-6985, U.S. District
Court, District of New Jersey (Trenton). </p>
<p>Research Affiliates Sues WisdomTree Over Portfolio Patents </p>
<p>Research Affiliates LLC, the asset-management company, sued
WisdomTree Investments Inc. for allegedly infringing three of
its patents. </p>
<p>The patents include a method for using accounting-data-
based indexing to create a portfolio of assets, Newport Beach,
California-based Research Affiliates said in a complaint filed
Dec. 1 in federal court in Santa Ana, California. </p>
<p>Our main focus is product quality and performance, but we
will protect our intellectual property and the interests of our
business partners when our patents are infringed, Research
Affiliates'' Chairman Rob Arnott said in a statement. </p>
<p>Research Affiliates, a closely held company majority owned
by its employees, said $78 billion in assets are managed using
investment strategies it developed. The company told WisdomTree
in 2005 that it was applying for one of the patents at issue,
according to the complaint. </p>
<p>WisdomTree responded by saying that Research Affiliates''
intellectual property rights were speculative at best and
that WisdomTree was submitting prior public information about
inventions related to the proposed patent to the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office, according to the complaint. The office issued
the patent to Research Affiliates, according to the filing. </p>
<p>Stuart Bell, a spokesman for New York-based WisdomTree,
didn''t respond to messages seeking comment. </p>
<p>Financial products that Research Affiliates claims infringe
its patents include WisdomTree Dividend Index and WisdomTree
Earnings Index. Research Affiliates is seeking a jury trial and
a court order to stop WisdomTree from using the methods alleged
to be patented. </p>
<p>WisdomTree, a firm specializing in exchange-traded funds,
said it manages about $11.4 billion in ETF assets. Michael
Steinhardt, the former hedge-fund manager, is chairman. </p>
<p>Research Affiliates is represented by Palo Alto,

permutations of the name in such phrases as Occupy Wall
Street, according to the database of the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office. </p>
<p>Among the most recent applications are one filed Nov. 22 to
register Occupy Los Angeles for use with political action
committee services. The applicant lists only a general-
delivery address in Los Angeles. </p>

<p>Bob Marley''s Family Sues Performer''s Half Brother for Infringing </p>
<p>The holders of the intellectual property rights related to
the Reggae singer Bob Marley sued the late performer''s half
brother for trademark infringement. </p>
<p>The suit, filed Dec. 1 in federal court in Ft. Lauderdale,
Florida, is related Richard Booker''s applications to register
Mama Marley and Nine Mile as trademarks in the U.S. </p>
<p>According to court papers, Booker operates a restaurant in
Jamaica named Mama Marley''s and conducts tours of the Nine
Mile region of Jamaica, a region of the island country
associated with the late singer and where he is buried. </p>
<p>The IP rights holders also complain that Booker has
advertised his restaurant in the U.S. and operates the Nine Mile
Music Festival and the www.bobmarleymovement.com website

engaged in extensive settlement talks with Booker over his
use of the name and likeness of the late performer. </p>
<p>The rights holders -- Marley''s widow and nine of his 11
children -- asked the court to bar further trademark
infringement by Booker, and for an order cancelling Booker''s 9
Mile Music trademark and barring the registration of several
pending trademark applications. Additionally, they seek awards
of money damages, attorney fees and litigation costs. </p>

<p>Copyright </p>
<p>Anti-Piracy Group BREIN Accused by Composer of Infringing </p>
<p>Bescherming Rechten Entertainment Industrie Nederland, the
Dutch anti-piracy group known as BREIN, has itself been accused
of copyright infringement by a musician who said the group is
using his work without permission, the anti-copyright Torrent
Freak website reported. </p>
<p>Melchior Rietveldt was asked by BREIN to compose music for
an anti-piracy video to be shown at a local music festival, and
is now objecting to its use by the organization in other
contexts, according to Torrent Freak. </p>
<p>He found his music included in an anti-piracy message
embedded in a DVD of one of the Harry Potter films, Torrent
Freak reported. </p>
<p>The composer is seeking at least 1 million Euros ($1.4
million) in compensation for what he says is unauthorized use of
his work, according to Torrent Freak. </p>
<p>Lawmakers Float Alternative to Google-Opposed Online Piracy Bill </p>
<p>U.S. lawmakers are circulating an alternative approach to
Hollywood-backed anti-piracy legislation after Internet
companies including Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. objected to
the bills. </p>
<p>Under the draft proposal from a bipartisan group of Senate
and House members, U.S. intellectual-property holders could
petition the U.S. International Trade Commission to investigate
foreign websites accused of trafficking in pirated content and
counterfeit goods. The commission is an independent agency set
up to protect U.S. markets from unfair trade practices. </p>
<p>We''re going to be able to handcuff the bad actors that
are selling fake movies and Viagra, Senator Ron Wyden, an
Oregon Democrat who helped draft the proposal, said in an
interview Dec. 1. This is a model that gets us a chance to go
after them without doing so much damage to the architecture of
the Internet. </p>
<p>Anti-piracy bills in the House and Senate have pitted the
nation''s biggest Internet companies against the U.S. film and
music industries, which want the government to do more to halt
the online sale of goods such as knockoff watches and illegally
copied music. Web companies say the proposed legislation would
require them to police the Internet, undermining the growth of
the U.S. technology industry. </p>
<p>The House bill would let the U.S. attorney general seek
court orders requiring U.S. Internet-service providers, search
engines, payment processors and ad networks to block or cease
business with websites linked to online piracy. The measure,
introduced in October by House Judiciary Committee Chairman
Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican, also would give intellectual-
property holders ways to compel payment and ad services to sever
ties with such websites. </p>
<p>The Senate Judiciary Committee approved in May a similar
bill, S. 968, known as the Protect IP Act. Both the House and
Senate measures have multiple co-sponsors from both parties.
Wyden has threatened to block the Protect IP Act from reaching a
vote in the full Senate. </p>
<p>Under the alternative proposal, the International Trade
Commission would be authorized to issue cease-and-desist orders
against foreign websites that could be used to force payment
processors, such as Visa Inc. or PayPal Inc., and online
advertising networks to cease providing services to such
websites. </p>
<p>The trade agency has the power to block imports of products
found to infringe intellectual property rights, can propose
tariffs on products to counter subsidized imports and
investigates trade-related issues for Congress and the
president. </p>
<p>Wyden said the group intends to circulate the draft and
request feedback, and introduce legislation in the coming weeks. </p>
<p>The alternative proposal was signed by 10 lawmakers from
both parties, including Democratic Senators Maria Cantwell of
Washington and Mark Warner of Virginia; Republican
Representatives Darrell Issa of California and Jason Chaffetz of
Utah; and Democratic Representatives Anna Eshoo and Zoe Lofgren
of California. </p>
<p>The House bill is H.R. 3261. </p>

<p>Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage </p>
<p>Colorado Holds Hearing on Fracking Formula Trade Secrets </p>
<p>Colorado''s oil company regulators are to hear testimony
today about the confidentiality of formulas for fluids used to
fracture underground rock structures in the search for oil, the
Coloradoan reported. </p>
<p>Governor John Hickenlooper has proposed a new rule that
would mandate disclosure of chemicals used for hydraulic
fracturing, or fracking, which many oil-exploration
companies maintain should be exempted as trade secrets,
according to the Coloradan. </p>
<p>Some environmental groups contend it''s vital to disclose
these chemicals as some of them could contaminate drinking
water, according to the newspaper. </p>
<p>Under the proposed rule, energy companies would have to
disclose their fracking formulas on a publicly accessible
website, the Coloradoan reported. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) must pay $72.6 million in
damages to three women who said they developed breast cancer
after taking the company''s menopause drugs, a Philadelphia jury
decided. </p>
<p>Jurors today in state court deliberated over two days
before finding hormone-replacement drugs made by Pfizer''s Wyeth
and Pharmacia Upjohn units were responsible for Susan Elfont,
Bernadette Kalenkoski and Judy Mulderig developing cancer. The
panel awarded Elfont $20 million in compensatory damages;
Kalenkoski, $27.85 million; and Mulderig, $24.75 million. </p>
<p>We are obviously disappointed with the verdict in this
case, Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said in a written
statement. Once the verdict is finalized, the company will
weigh its legal options to determine how it will continue with
the case. </p>
<p>More than 6 million women took Prempro and related
menopause drugs to treat symptoms such as hot flashes and mood
swings before a 2002 study highlighted their links to cancer.
Wyeth''s sales of the medicines, which are still on the market,
topped $2 billion before the release of the Women''s Health
Initiative, a National Institutes of Health-sponsored study. </p>
<p>Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Premarin,
Wyeth''s estrogen-based drug, with progestin-laden Provera, made
by Pfizer''s Upjohn unit, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth
combined the two hormones in its Prempro pill. </p>
<p>Litigation Scorecard </p>
<p>Pfizer''s Wyeth and Upjohn units have now lost 10 of the 18
Prempro cases decided by juries since trials began in 2006. The
drugmaker got some of those verdicts thrown out after trial or
had the awards reduced. It resolved some of the verdicts through
settlements, while other decisions are on appeal. It also has
had cases thrown out before trial. </p>
<p>Pfizer announced in May that it had settled a third of the
pending Prempro cases and had set aside $772 million to help
resolve the claims. </p>
<p>Elfont, 66, is a former teacher who once lived in Northeast
Philadelphia, Tobi Millrood, a lawyer for the three women, said
during the trial. She took Premarin and Provera for more than
two years before being diagnosed with breast cancer in 1997,
Millrood said. </p>
<p>Retired Teacher </p>
<p>Kalenkoski, 68, is a former nursing home aide who took
Prempro for more than four years and was diagnosed with cancer
in 2002, Millrood said. Mulderig, 68, a retired teacher from
Carlisle, Pennsylvania, took Premarin and Provera for 11 years
starting in 1988, the lawyer added. </p>
<p>Millrood told jurors during the first phase of the two-week
trial that none of the three women had a family history of
breast cancer and experts concluded their use of menopause drugs
led to the development of the disease. </p>
<p>Millrood declined today to comment on the verdict because
jurors must further consider Wyeth''s liability for damages in
the second phase of the case, slated to begin Dec. 9. </p>
<p>Diane Sullivan, one of the lawyers for the Pfizer units,
said the evidence was unclear on how long the women had taken
menopause drugs because of gaps in their pharmacy records. She
said the women''s individual cases differed from those covered by
the WHI study and plaintiffs shouldn''t be able to rely on that
study to make their case. </p>
<p>They are trying to make these women fit with the WHI
study and they don''t fit, Sullivan told the seven-man, five-
woman jury in closing arguments. </p>
<p>The last Prempro verdict against the Pfizer units came a
year ago in Puerto Rico, where a jury awarded $1.5 million in
damages to a pharmacist who took the menopause drug. The company
won the next two cases before today''s verdict. </p>
<p>The Philadelphia case is Elfont v. Wyeth Pharmaceuticals
Inc., 00924, Jury Term 2004, Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas
(Philadelphia). </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world''s
biggest company by market value, expects Abu Dhabi to change the
terms for the Persian Gulf emirate''s main oil producing
concession when the current agreement expires in 2014, its chief
executive officer said. </p>
<p>The concession structure and terms that served all
parties well in the past are just no longer appropriate in
today''s environment, both in terms of cost and prices, Rex Tillerson said today at the World Petroleum Congress in Doha.
Everyone is committed to finding that new structure that
allows us to continue to work together. </p>
<p>Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) and BP Plc produce oil at
onshore fields in Abu Dhabi under a concession agreement that
dates back to 1939. The fields began commercial production in
1960 and Abu Dhabi''s state-run oil company joined as a partner
in the 1970s, forming the current operating venture Abu Dhabi
Co. for Onshore Oil Operations, or ADCO. ADCO holds the
concession for six main onshore fields until 2014. </p>
<p>The joint venture agreement is under very active
discussion with the national oil company and government of Abu
Dhabi, Tillerson said, without giving further details. Shell''s
Chief Executive Officer Peter Voser, also attending the Doha
conference, declined to comment on the concession. </p>
<p>Abu Dhabi holds more than 90 percent of crude in the United
Arab Emirates, one of the few Middle East states that allow
foreign companies to explore for and produce oil within its
borders. State-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., or Adnoc, holds
60 percent of ADCO, with the international oil companies Exxon,
Shell, BP, Total SA (FP) and Partex Oil  Gas holding the rest. </p>
<p>Abu Dhabi is the largest sheikhdom of the United Arab
Emirates. </p>

<p>General Motors Co. (GM) reported China
sales in November rose at the fastest pace in 10 months, led by
deliveries of Wuling light trucks and Buick Excelle sedans. </p>
<p>Deliveries to Chinese dealers last month climbed 20 percent
from a year ago to 237,130 vehicles, the Detroit-based company
said in a statement today. That''s the fastest increase China''s
largest foreign carmaker has reported since January. </p>
<p>Sales of mini commercial vehicles and sedans at SAIC-GM-
Wuling Automobile Co. jumped 40 percent after GM,  poised to
overtake Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) in global annual sales, cut prices
of Wuling light trucks. The gains were a contrast to Ford Motor
Co. (F) and Honda Motor Co., which posted drops in deliveries last
month as overall demand in the country slows. </p>
<p>GM gained a lot of market share from their minivan
competitors this year through discounts and a strong
reputation, said Marvin Zhu, a Shanghai-based analyst at
researcher LMC Automotive. Wuling''s quality and service is
perceived to be better than other local brands, Zhu said. </p>
<p>For the first 11 months of 2011, GM''s deliveries increased
8.2 percent to 2.35 million in the world''s largest automobile
market. Still, that''s slowing from 2010, when sales climbed 29
percent, after the government phased out sales-tax breaks and
rebates for rural buyers in January. </p>
<p>The carmaker aims to expand its luxury car and sport-
utility vehicle lineup to double deliveries in the country to 5
million by 2015. </p>
<p>Chinese Slowdown </p>
<p>Not all carmakers saw demand rise, adding to indications
that the world''s second-largest economy is cooling. China''s
central bank last week cut lenders'' reserve requirements for the
first time since 2008 to pump money into the financial system. </p>
<p>Ford''s China sales fell 7 percent in November to 43,338
units, led by a 19 percent decline in deliveries at its
commercial-vehicle joint venture, according to an e-mailed
statement today. </p>
<p>Honda, Japan''s third-largest automaker, said it sold 58,228
vehicles in China last month, 3.3 percent fewer than a year
earlier. The Tokyo-based company said deliveries decreased by
8.4 percent to 539,442 units in the first 11 months. </p>
<p>Auto sales in China surged 32 percent to 18.06 million
vehicles in 2010, according to the China Association of
Automobile Manufacturers. Growth slowed to 3.2 percent during
the first 10 months of this year, according to the association,
which will report November industry figures later this month. </p>
<p>Chinese auto demand may expand 5 percent to 10 percent in
2012, led by demand for passenger cars, Kevin Wale, president of
GM''s China unit, said in an interview on Nov. 17. Sales of
commercial vehicles will probably grow 5 percent, he said. </p>
<p>Slowing Growth </p>
<p>GM is banking on China to offset a shrinking market in
Europe, where researcher IHS Automotive estimates car demand
will fall 1 percent in 2012, the fifth straight annual decline. </p>
<p>Sales by SAIC-GM-Wuling, GM''s minivan venture with SAIC
Motor Corp. (600104), rose to 119,133 vehicles, a record for November,
according to the statement. The partnership makes China''s best-
selling vehicle in 2010, the Wuling Sunshine minivan. </p>
<p>Shanghai GM, the U.S. carmaker''s sedan venture with SAIC
that produces Buick and Chevrolet-branded cars, boosted sales
7.6 percent to 113,120 vehicles. Sales of Buick Excelle
passenger cars climbed 25 percent to 23,885 units. </p>
<p>Sales growth at Shanghai GM may slow to 12 percent next
year as the automaker faces capacity constraints and few model
rollouts, LMC''s Zhu said. The passenger carmaker is expected to
deliver 19 percent more cars this year, he forecast. </p>
<p>GM''s Buick, Chevrolet and Wuling are among the most
successful international brands in China, and their dealerships

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s biggest
drugmaker, won a U.S. panel''s backing for an experimental
medicine for advanced kidney cancer in patients who have failed
prior treatments. </p>
<p>The benefits of the drug, known as axitinib, outweigh its
risks, 13 outside advisers to the Food and Drug Administration
said today in a unanimous vote in Silver Spring, Maryland. The
FDA isn''t required to follow advisory panels'' recommendations. </p>
<p>The medicine from New York-based Pfizer may compete with
Aveo Pharmaceuticals Inc. (AVEO)''s tivozanib, a kidney-cancer drug in
late-stage clinical trials. Both treatments block receptors in
the body thought to play a role in spreading tumors. Kidney
cancer affects 296,000 people in the U.S., according to the
American Cancer Society. </p>
<p>It met the regulatory bar for approval and offers an
important or useful alternative to approved treatments, said
Wyndham Wilson, the panel chairman, who is chief of lymphoma
therapeutics at the National Cancer Institute''s Center for
Cancer Research, in Rockville, Maryland. </p>
<p>Pfizer gained 1.2 percent to $20.47 at the close in New
York. The shares have increased 17 percent this year. </p>
<p>Sales of axitinib, if approved, may reach $576 million in
2014, according to the average estimate of three analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Pfizer is seeking to sell the treatment
under the name Inlyta. </p>
<p>Additional Options </p>
<p>We are pleased with the panel''s recommendation in support
of axitinib for the treatment of previously treated advanced
renal cell carcinoma, as additional therapeutic options are
still needed for this patient population, Mace Rothenberg,
senior vice president of clinical development and medical
affairs at Pfizer, said in an e-mail after the vote. </p>
<p>FDA staff reviewers questioned the significance of efficacy
data in a trial that compared axitinib with kidney-cancer drug
Nexavar from German drugmaker Bayer AG. In the study of 723
patients who had failed one prior therapy, those treated with
axitinib lived a median of 6.7 months before their tumors got
worse, two months longer than those who received Nexavar, agency
staff said in a Dec. 5 report. </p>
<p>That two-month benefit was driven by a subset of patients
that is likely to be scarce in the United States, the
reviewers said. </p>
<p>Previous Treatments </p>
<p>Axitinib was most effective in people previously treated
with cytokines, immune-boosting drugs that aren''t as widely used
as newer therapies such Pfizer''s Sutent. Patients in the
cytokine group who received axitinib lived a median of 5.6
months longer without tumor progression than those in that group
who were treated with Nexavar, agency reviewers said. </p>
<p>Axitinib''s benefits were meager in the larger group of
patients treated previously with Sutent, delaying tumor growth
just 1.4 months longer than Nexavar did, according to the
report. </p>
<p>The FDA''s concerns about axitinib may have positive
implications for the competing drug being developed by
Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Aveo, said Thomas Wei, an analyst
at Jefferies  Co. in New York. </p>
<p>We remain bullish on the prospects for tivozanib to
become the standard of care in the first-line treatment of renal
cell carcinoma, Wei said Dec. 5 in a note to clients. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
derivatives dealer among U.S. banks, has bought and sold
notional credit derivatives on about $100 billion of sovereign
and non-sovereign debt in the five troubled European nations,
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said today. </p>
<p>The bank had about $13.9 billion of mark-to-market
derivative exposure as of Nov. 17, offset by $6.3 billion of
collateral, Dimon said at an investor conference in New York.
JPMorgan would likely have a direct loss of about $3 billion if
a disaster occurred in the region''s debt crisis, he said. </p>
<p>I get asked the question with derivatives of $14 billion,
people say my God, that''s your net because you have huge long
and short,'' and we do. It''s maybe $100 billion by $100 billion,
I forgot the exact number, Dimon said. </p>
<p>The disclosure is the first by a major U.S. bank regarding
the notional derivatives it bought and sold on the region as
investors seek to judge banks'' risks linked to the European debt
crisis. Banks provide their global notional credit derivatives
bought and sold, and have begun providing net exposure figures
to Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain, sometimes called
the GIIPS. </p>
<p>Dimon said the bank doesn''t net its derivative exposure
across counterparties, so it would not sell protection on
Italian debt to one bank and buy credit-default swaps on Italian
debt from another and consider those exposures offsetting. </p>
<p>The default of a counterparty is not going to sink our
hedges, Dimon said. We don''t have a lot of wrong-way risk. </p>
<p>Counterparties </p>
<p>Credit derivatives counterparties are primarily outside the
GIIPS and are either investment-grade or are supported by
collateral arrangements, according to a presentation from the
bank. Dimon also said all the firm''s hedging was done with
counterparties outside the five countries. </p>
<p>As of Sept. 30, JPMorgan said worldwide it had sold $3.13
trillion of credit-derivative protection and purchased $3.07
trillion, up from $2.75 trillion sold and $2.72 trillion bought
at the end of 2010, filings show. The firm was the largest
dealer of credit derivatives among U.S. banks in the second
quarter, according to data from the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest
U.S. lender by assets, will have essentially flat investment
bank revenue this quarter excluding accounting adjustments,
according to Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon. </p>
<p>The comparison is to this year''s third quarter, said
Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for the New York-based firm.
That period was the worst for trading and investment-banking
revenue at the biggest Wall Street firms since the depths of the
financial crisis in 2008, excluding accounting gains. </p>
<p>Dimon''s remarks in a presentation today show U.S.
investment banks still face pressure as corporations delay
raising capital and investors sell riskier assets amid concern
that the U.S. economy is weakening and Europe''s debt crisis may
spread. JPMorgan''s private-equity unit also expects to post a
modest loss in this year''s fourth quarter, Dimon wrote in
the presentation. </p>
<p>The company''s investment bank generated about $4.5 billion
in revenue during the third quarter after backing out a $1.9
billion gain in debt-valuation adjustments. Dimon excluded that
accounting effect in forecasting the unit''s revenue in the
presentation at a New York investor conference sponsored by
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) </p>
<p>Debt Ceiling </p>
<p>Revenue at the investment-banking unit has slid this year
from $8.2 billion in the first quarter as concerns mounted in
the third quarter that Greece would default and U.S. lawmakers
would fail to raise the debt ceiling. JPMorgan told investors in
October that the division will face similar market conditions
for the rest of the year. </p>
<p>The unit''s long-term prospects show promise, Dimon said in
the presentation. Global credit needs may expand by about $160
trillion over the next 10 years and worldwide investment demand
may increase from 20 percent of gross domestic product in 2010
to 25 percent by 2030, according to the presentation. </p>
<p>JPMorgan climbed 1.7 percent to $33.80 at 1:22 p.m. in New
York, making it the day''s biggest gainer (INDU) in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average. </p>
<p>The bank has a battleship balance sheet (JPM), and by next
year can meet proposed international capital standards that take
full effect in 2019, if the board wants to meet them early,
Dimon said in the presentation. Dimon has previously referred to
JPMorgan as having a fortress balance sheet to tout the
bank''s overall financial health. The company is the largest and
most profitable U.S. bank and was among the only major U.S.
lenders to remain profitable throughout the recession. </p>
<p>We''re Sorry'' </p>
<p>JPMorgan may buy back an additional $950 million in stock
approved as part of a $15 billion capital-distribution program
by the Federal Reserve, according to the presentation. The
allowance represents a reallocation of previously approved
capacity from the Fed''s 2011 capital tests, he wrote. </p>
<p>The bank completed its $8 billion stock-repurchase plan
approved by the Fed in March after buying back $4.4 billion of
common equity in the third quarter, for which Dimon apologized. </p>
<p>We spent a whole $8 billion buying back stock, he said
in an Oct. 13 conference call with analysts. And yes, it would
have been wiser to wait. We''re sorry. </p>

<p>International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
will reach a settlement with European Union antitrust regulators
next week to end a probe into mainframe software, according to
two people familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>The European Commission intends to accept an offer made by
IBM in September to resolve a dispute over anti-competitive
behaviour that may have blocked rival mainframe software makers,
said the people who couldn''t be identified because the talks are
private. </p>
<p>Regulators have sought comments from rivals and customers
on IBM''s commitments to ensure the availability of certain spare
parts and technical information. The Brussels-based regulator
closed a separate probe over IBM''s mainframe computers after
three competitors dropped complaints. </p>
<p>The commission in 2010 opened investigations into Armonk,
New York-based IBM over possible anti-competitive behavior that
may have blocked competitors in mainframe software and
maintenance contracts by restricting or delaying access to
spare parts. </p>
<p>Joe Hanley, a spokesman for IBM in London, declined to
comment. Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for the commission, didn''t
immediately respond to a call and e-mail seeking comment. </p>
<p>Reuters reported the settlement earlier today. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Bank of America
Corp. (BAC) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) are among 22 financial firms
that received top marks today as the best workplaces for
lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees. </p>
<p>The three banks were among 207 U.S. companies that offer
health insurance covering medical services for transgender
employees seeking sexual reassignment, according to the 10th
annual Corporate Equality Index from the Human Rights Campaign
Foundation, a nonprofit that backs civil rights for lesbian,
gay, bisexual and transgender individuals. </p>
<p>Financial firms outperformed most other industries in
adopting and enforcing non-discrimination policies, offering
health insurance for same-sex partners and recruiting and
retaining lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees,
according to the report. </p>
<p>This rating reflects equal health-care coverage for all
LGBT employees and their families, including full parity for
domestic partner benefits not only in basic medical coverage,
but in dependent care, retirement and other benefits that affect
families'' financial and medical well-being, Joe Solmonese,
president of the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, said in the
report. </p>
<p>AmEx, Google </p>
<p>The Human Rights Campaign gave 88 Fortune 500 companies
scores of 100 percent and the designation as the Best Places
to Work for LGBT Equality. Among the 190 companies that
received perfect scores are financial firms including American
Express Co., (AXP) Citigroup Inc. (C) and Morgan Stanley. (MS) Google Inc.,
Ford Motor Corp. and Gap Inc. (GPS) also received top marks. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is one of nine companies to achieve the highest
rating for 10 straight years, along with Aetna Inc. (AET), Alcatel-
Lucent, American Airlines parent AMR Corp. (AMR), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Eastman
Kodak Co. (EK), Nike Inc. (NKE), Replacements Ltd. and Xerox Corp. (XRX),
according to Paul Guequierre, a foundation spokesman. </p>
<p>The 2012 index ranked 850 firms. More than half of
companies in the Fortune 500 submitted surveys voluntarily and
the rest were rated based on publicly available data, according
to the foundation. </p>
<p>NYSE Euronext, owner of the New York Stock Exchange, and
Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ), which runs the Nasdaq Stock Market, were
among firms with the lowest scores at 15 percent. </p>
<p>We believe the low score reflects the fact that we were
not aware of the survey and that NYSE didn''t give data to the
foundation, Richard Adamonis, a spokesman for NYSE Euronext (NYX),
said in an e-mail. We have a diverse workforce and support
many programs that are oriented to the LGBT community including

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the biggest computer services provider, agreed to buy
DemandTec Inc. (DMAN) for $440 million, adding Internet-based tools to
help businesses adjust promotions based on buying patterns. </p>
<p>The all-cash transaction amounts to $13.20 a share, and is
expected to close in the first quarter of 2012, Armonk, New
York-based IBM said today in a statement. That''s 57 percent
higher than DemandTec''s closing price yesterday. IBM said last
year it plans to spend about $20 billion on acquisitions through
2015, as it expands offerings to business customers. </p>
<p>The purchase is IBM''s biggest since the takeover of
analytics-technology provider Netezza Corp. last year for about
$1.7 billion. DemandTec will extend IBM''s Smarter Commerce
initiative, allowing companies to quickly adjust prices,
promotions and other marketing efforts by analyzing online and
in-store buying trends. </p>
<p>DemandTec assets could be a good fit, Mark Moskowitz,
an analyst at JPMorgan  Chase Co. with an overweight rating
on IBM shares, said in a note to clients today. DemandTec is
another example of IBM finding quality assets. </p>
<p>IBM fell 1.3 percent to $191.58 at the close in New York.
DemandTec jumped 56 percent to $13.15. </p>
<p>IBM is paying a premium of 72 percent compared with the 20-
day trading average price before the announcement. The average
premium of 52 acquisitions of decision-support software
companies in the U.S. was 45 percent in the past five years. </p>
<p>DemandTec, based in San Mateo, California, employs more
than 350 people and has about 450 customers worldwide, including
Best Buy Co., ConAgra Foods Inc. and Target Corp. </p>
<p>The overall market for Smarter Commerce software is worth
$20 billion, IBM estimates. The company spent $2.5 billion on
three Internet commerce acquisitions last year, buying Sterling
Commerce, Coremetrics Inc. and Unica Corp. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s largest
drugmaker, persuaded a Pennsylvania appeals court to review an
$8.6 million punitive-damages award to a woman who blamed her
cancer on the company''s menopause drugs. </p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments by
Pfizer''s Wyeth unit that a judge erred in allowing a
Philadelphia jury to award punishment damages to Mary Daniel, a
former bank manager from Arkansas who sued the drugmaker
alleging its Prempro pills caused her breast cancer. Jurors also
awarded Daniel more than $1.6 million in compensatory damages on
her claim. </p>
<p>More than 6 million women took Prempro and related
menopause drugs to treat symptoms such as hot flashes and mood
swings before a 2002 study highlighted their links to cancer.
Wyeth''s sales of the medicines, which are still on the market,
topped $2 billion before the release of the Women''s Health
Initiative, a National Institutes of Health-sponsored study. </p>
<p>The company is pleased the Pennsylvania Supreme Court
will hear the company''s appeal regarding whether punitive
damages are warranted, Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said
in an e-mailed statement today. The company has said all along
that Wyeth acted responsibly in its handling of the drug, he
added. </p>
<p>Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Premarin,
Wyeth''s estrogen-based drug, with progestin-laden Provera, made
by Pfizer''s Upjohn unit, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth
combined the two hormones in its Prempro pill. </p>
<p>Prempro Scorecard </p>
<p>Pfizer''s Wyeth and Pharmacia  Upjohn units have lost 10
out of the 18 Prempro cases that juries have considered since
trials began in 2006. The most recent verdict came earlier this
week when a Philadelphia jury awarded three women more than
$72 million in damages on their claims over the drugmaker''s
hormone-replacement medications. </p>
<p>The drugmaker has gotten some of those verdicts thrown out
after trial or had the awards reduced. It resolved some of the
verdicts through settlements, while other decisions are on
appeal. It also has persuaded some judges to throw cases out
before trial. </p>
<p>In Daniel''s case, jurors found Wyeth''s Prempro and Premarin
drugs were a cause of the woman''s cancer and awarded her a total
of $10.2 million in damages. A judge in the case later threw out
of the award. </p>
<p>Award Reinstated </p>
<p>Earlier this year, a lower Pennsylvania appeals court
reinstated Daniel''s jury award after finding the judge in the
case didn''t err in refusing to give a drugmaker a new trial. </p>
<p>The state''s highest appellate court agreed Dec. 5 to review
whether Daniel was entitled to receive punitive damages for a
product that had been approved by federal regulators. </p>
<p>We are pleased the court declined to consider any issue
relating to Wyeth''s negligence in causing her breast cancer or
Mrs. Daniel''s compensatory award, Zoe Littlepage, one of the
woman''s lawyers, said in an e-mailed statement today. </p>
<p>The case is Daniel v. Wyeth, 040602368, Court of Common
Pleas (Philadelphia). </p>

<p>General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP), the
second-largest U.S. mall owner, said that its funds from
operations excluding some items may rise to as much as $1.03 a
share next year as occupancies rise. </p>
<p>The forecast, which has a low end of 99 cents, compares
with expected 2011 core FFO of 93 cents to 95 cents, the
real estate investment trust said in an investor presentation
filed today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>
<p>General Growth, which left bankruptcy protection 13 months
ago, is refinancing debt to cut expenses and plans to expand,
redevelop and refurbish properties to boost growth. In October,
the Chicago-based company sold Faneuil Hall Marketplace in
Boston, the office and garage components of Westlake Center in
Seattle and a shopping center in Provo, Utah, as it focuses on
regional malls. </p>
<p>Occupancy probably will rise to 92 percent in 2012 from
90.5 percent this year, according to General Growth, which is
holding an investor conference today in Chicago. The company''s
properties include Water Tower Place on Michigan Avenue in
Chicago and Fashion Show in Las Vegas. </p>
<p>The REIT was expected to have 2012 FFO of 98 cents a share,
the average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. FFO
is a measure of a property owner''s ability to generate cash. </p>
<p>General Growth is planning to spin off 30 malls to
shareholders through a special dividend. They will be
transferred to a new publicly traded REIT, Rouse Properties Inc.
General Growth spent $11.3 billion to buy developer Rouse Co. in
2004. Excluding properties to be included in Rouse, core FFO is
likely to be 90 cents to 94 cents next year, General Growth
said. </p>
<p>General Growth rose 0.6 percent to $14.29 in New York
trading yesterday. </p>
<p>Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG), based in Indianapolis, is the
only U.S. mall owner larger than General Growth. </p>

<p>U.S. researchers gained access to a
database of 2.4 million chemical formulas and diagrams that
International Business Machine Corp. (IBM) culled from 24 years'' worth
of patent applications and medical journals. </p>
<p>The catalogue of compounds will be housed at the National
Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. Scientists can use
the data to identify new candidates for drug development or new
uses for existing drugs. </p>
<p>The applications are very wide reaching, from life
sciences to chemicals, petroleum, to food, to health, said
Chris Moore, a partner and vice president in Armonk, New York-
based IBM''s global life sciences division, in a telephone
interview. </p>
<p>The NIH has made development of drugs for rare diseases
such as sickle cell anemia a priority since Francis Collins
became director of the $31 billion research agency in 2009.
Collins has asked Congress to create a new institute for drug
development and pressed manufacturers to open catalogs of
abandoned compounds. </p>
<p>IBM, the world''s biggest computer-services provider,
created the database by Watson-type technology, Moore said,
referring to the supercomputer that beat human competitors on
the game show Jeopardy.'' The data was extracted from about 4.7
million U.S., European and United Nations patents and 11 million
biomedical journal abstracts from 1976 to 2000. </p>
<p>Researchers can search the database for free. IBM plans to
sell a product that will produce more sophisticated analysis of
the database that can tell customers who is conducting research

<p>Microsoft Corp. is seeking to hire a
television executive to develop original shows as part of a
drive to expand its Xbox Live game and video service, according
to people with knowledge of the company''s plans. </p>
<p>Microsoft has hired Tom Schneider, a partner at Stratis
LLC, to conduct the search, said the people, who weren''t
authorized to speak publicly. Two former NBC executives, Marc Graboff and Jeff Gaspin, have been approached, they said. </p>
<p>Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, is trying to turn
the Xbox console into an entertainment hub, rather than mostly a
game machine. The company, the world''s largest software
producer, is introducing a TV service with programs from almost
40 TV and entertainment suppliers to draw more users to the Web-
enabled product. </p>
<p>Original programming would help Microsoft differentiate the
service from those offered by competitors including Apple Inc.
and Google Inc. (GOOG) Some of the Xbox''s top-selling games were
created by Microsoft and the company is looking to replicate
that success with program it develops. </p>
<p>The TV service will include content from partners like Time
Warner Inc. (TWX)''s HBO, Sony Corp.''s Crackle and the BBC. </p>
<p>Microsoft is only interested in making a hire if it can
find the right person and it''s possible no one will be chosen
for the job, one of the people said. </p>
<p>Gaspin was chairman of NBC Universal TV Entertainment. He
stepped down after Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) took control of NBC in January.
Graboff, president of west coast business operations for NBC
Entertainment, announced plans to leave last month. </p>
<p>David Dennis, a Microsoft spokesman, declined to comment.
Schneider didn''t respond to phone and e-mail requests for
comment. </p>
<p>Microsoft rose 1.2 percent to $25.70 at 4 p.m. New York
time. The stock has declined 7.9 percent this year. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp., the second-largest (CVX)
U.S. oil company, may need to drill a relief well at its $3.6
billion Frade project in deep water off Brazil''s coast as part
of measures to counter a spill. </p>
<p>The cementing at the Frade well that leaked last month
currently doesn''t guarantee 100 percent efficiency, Magda Chambriard, a director at the regulator known as ANP, told
reporters today in Rio de Janeiro. Drilling a relief well is
one possibility if Chevron doesn''t convince ANP that the
cementing is solidly stuck to the ground, Chambriard said. </p>
<p>A decision on the cementing may be reached as early as next
week, Chambriard said. </p>
<p>Chevron may have to pay as much as 350 million reais
($193.5 million) in fines and damages for the Nov. 7 leak of at
least 2,400 barrels of crude at the Frade project off the coast
of Rio de Janeiro. </p>
<p>Brazil has tightened safety conditions at oil projects
following the spill at BP Plc''s Macondo well in the Gulf of
Mexico last year, Chambriard said. The agency has shut 11
drilling rigs and production platforms over the past year
because of safety concerns, she said. </p>
<p>Our analysis so far indicates that the cement plugs have
been properly placed, Scott Walker, a spokesman for San Ramon,
California-based Chevron, said in an e-mailed response to
questions today. Chevron will continue to discuss this and
other issues with regulators and hopes to get their approval
soon to proceed with the proposed well abandonment plan,
Walker said in the e-mail. </p>
<p>A relief well off of Brazil''s coast will cost at least $50
million, according to Hernani Chavez a former exploration and
production manager at Petroleo Brasileiro SA. </p>
<p>Cementing the well should be totally sufficient, Chavez
said in a telephone interview from Rio de Janeiro today. At
Macondo, a relief well was necessary because they were unable to
halt the flow, the situation was completely different. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) plans to
issue four certificates of deposit linked to stocks as record
low interest rates drive investor demand for the potentially
higher-yielding CDs. </p>
<p>The structured CDs are the bank''s first and are set to
price at the end of the month, said a person with knowledge of
the offerings who declined to be identified because terms aren''t
set. One four-year CD is linked to changes in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average, with annual returns at a minimum of about
0.5 percent and a possible maximum of 24 percent, according to a
preliminary sales document. That compares with the average yield
of 1.15 percent for a three-year, fixed-rate deposit,
Bankrate.com data show. </p>
<p>Demand for CDs tied to assets such as equities, commodities
and exchange-traded funds has soared as the Federal Reserve has
held its benchmark rate at zero to 0.25 percent since 2008. Bank
revenue from the investments has more than tripled to $99 per
million dollars in retail deposits in October from $30 in
January, according to Kehrer-LIMRA Research compiled from
approximately 30 lenders, including Wells Fargo  Co. and
SunTrust Banks Inc. </p>
<p>The market-linked or structured CD market has had healthy
growth, said Glenn Lotenberg, a managing director at Incapital
LLC in Boca Raton, Florida, which expects to sell $2.5 billion
of structured CDs this year, from $2 billion in 2010. </p>
<p>Data on the market is incomplete as the investments aren''t
registered by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. doesn''t track market-linked
deposits separately. </p>
<p>Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Banks Benefit </p>
<p>Banks benefit from issuing structured CDs, which the FDIC
insures up to $250,000, by raising deposits at lower funding
levels and collecting commissions, said Tim Bonacci of CD
Funding Securities LLC, who''s helped about 30 financial
institutions set up their own proprietary CD business since
2005. The average fee on a five-year deposit is about 3 percent,
Bonacci said in an interview last month. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which was the most profitable securities
firm in Wall Street history before it converted to a bank in
2008 after the collapse of smaller rival Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc., had $41.8 billion in deposits in the third
quarter. That''s up from $38.6 billion at the end of 2010. </p>
<p>The four-year CD tracks the monthly percentage change in
the Dow, with gains capped at 1.5 percent to 2 percent and no
floor on the declines. That means if the Dow advanced 5 percent,
the monthly return would be recorded as no more than 2 percent,
while a drop of the same amount would be taken in full. </p>
<p>Banks create market-linked CDs by combining zero-coupon
bonds with derivatives to offer customized bets to investors.
Derivatives are contracts whose value is derived from stocks,
bonds, currencies and commodities. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. plans to
provide funding for a hedge fund being started by Todd Edgar, a
former commodities trader at Barclays Plc, said two people with
knowledge of the preparations. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs will make an investment through a so-called
seeding fund that the New York-based firm started this year
after raising money for it from pension funds and wealthy
individuals, the person said. Edgar will get $150 million to
$200 million from Goldman Sachs in return for a cut of the fees
his hedge fund generates, said the people who declined to be
identified because the negotiations are private. </p>
<p>The U.S. Congress last year restricted banks'' investments
in hedge funds through the so-called Volcker rule after
lawmakers concluded that financial institutions shouldn''t be
using federally backed deposits for wagers on markets. The
Goldman Sachs seeding fund is permitted under the law because it
uses client money rather than the firm''s capital. </p>
<p>Edgar and his team of commodities traders left Barclays (BARC) in
the third quarter of this year. His fund will trade futures and
options on metals based on the firm''s views of global economic
trends, the people said. The fund will be based in New York and
plans to start trading next year, the people said. </p>
<p>Joanna Carss, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in London,
and Edgar declined to comment. He joined Barclays, Britain''s
second-largest bank by assets, from JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) in
2009. </p>
<p>Blackstone Group </p>
<p>Some hedge funds are turning to firms such as Goldman Sachs
and Blackstone Group LP (BX) that provide startup financing because
pension funds and other investors have shied away from smaller
money managers since the credit crisis in 2008. Two-thirds of
the asset growth for hedge funds since 2009 has been at firms
managing more than $5 billion, according to Chicago-based Hedge
Fund Research Inc. </p>
<p>Blackstone, the world''s largest private-equity firm,
invests in hedge funds for a slice of a manager''s fees and an
equity stake in the company. Hedge funds, private pools that try
to make money whether markets are rising or falling, typically
charge clients 2 percent of assets managed and 20 percent of any
investment gains. </p>
<p>Edgar''s fund will be the second to receive an investment
from Goldman Sachs this year. In September, Goldman Sachs
invested $100 million in New York-based Palestra Capital
Management LLC, a fund focused on stocks run by Jeremy Schiffman
and Andrew Immerman, one of the people said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs has received about $600 million from clients
to invest in startup hedge funds with plans to raise more money,
the person said. Goldman Sachs''s hedge-fund investment effort is
being led by two executives, Kent Clark in New York and Ali Raissi in London. </p>
<p>The firm shut an earlier seeding fund in 2008, a year when
hedge funds lost 20 percent on average after the collapse of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. </p>

<p>Jon Corzine and four other former
executives of bankrupt MF Global Holdings Ltd. were sued by a
group of commodity traders seeking damages for lost funds. </p>
<p>Henning-Carey Proprietary Trading LLC, a clearing firm and
member of CME Group Inc. (CME), joined with eight traders in seeking
recovery of an unaccounted-for $1.2 billion in customer funds at
the brokerage unit MF Global Inc. </p>
<p>Defendants were responsible for insuring that the
plaintiffs'' property was properly segregated and accounted
for, the traders said in the complaint filed yesterday in
federal court in Chicago. </p>
<p>The suit is one of several filed by brokerage customers and
former employees against Corzine, MF Global executives or the
company since it filed for bankruptcy protection on Oct. 31. </p>
<p>Corzine told the House Agriculture Committee at a hearing
in Washington yesterday that he would never have intended
transfers from segregated accounts and had teams in place at the
firm to ensure they didn''t occur. </p>
<p>He wouldn''t say if he and other executives were willing to
share customers'' losses. </p>
<p>Corzine and his executives were responsible for looking
after customers'' segregated accounts, yet the money went missing
as the company tried to salvage its business after engaging in
highly leveraged and speculative trading in foreign sovereign
bonds, the traders claimed in the complaint. </p>
<p>Andrew Levander, an attorney for Corzine, didn''t respond to
an e-mail yesterday seeking comment on the traders'' allegations. </p>
<p>The plaintiffs'' accounts were frozen along with about
38,000 others on Oct. 31, after apparent segregation
violations, making it impossible for customers to access their
accounts or the assets in them, the plaintiffs said. </p>
<p>The case is Henning-Carey Proprietary Trading LLC v.
Corzine, 11-cv-08717, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
Illinois (Chicago). </p>

<p>Julius Baer, Falcon Sued by Trustee for Madoff-Related Funds </p>
<p>Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER), the 121-year-old Swiss wealth
manager, and Falcon Private Bank Ltd. were sued by the trustee
liquidating Bernard Madoff''s former investment firm who is
seeking to recover $76 million in redemptions. </p>
<p>Irving Picard filed two lawsuits yesterday in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan for a return of funds that were
transferred to the two Swiss banks by investors in Fairfield
Sentry Ltd., a feeder fund for Madoff''s firm. The trustee seeks
about $37 million from Julius Baer and about $39 million from
Falcon, a Zurich-based private bank owned by the government of
Abu Dhabi. </p>
<p>We cannot comment on pending legal cases, said Jan
Vonder Muehll, a Zurich-based spokesman for Julius Baer, which
manages 166 billion Swiss francs ($179 billion) for private
clients. </p>
<p>In 2010, the liquidators of the Fairfield funds started
separate litigation against Julius Baer, the bank said in its
2010 annual report. </p>
<p>Madoff, who pleaded guilty to fraud charges, is serving 150
years in prison for the largest Ponzi scheme in U.S. history.
Investors lost about $19 billion in principal, Picard has said.
Fairfield is in liquidation in the British Virgin Islands.
Picard has filed similar lawsuits to recover investments taken
out of Madoff''s firm before the fraud was exposed. </p>
<p>Irene Franco, a spokeswoman for Falcon, said the firm
hasn''t been informed about the claim. </p>
<p>The cases are Picard v. Bank Julius Baer  Co., 11-2922,
and Picard v. Falcon Private Bank, 11-2923, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<p>Stichting Pensioenfonds Sues JPMorgan Chase Over Securities </p>
<p>Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP, the Netherlands'' biggest
retirement fund, sued JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), alleging violations
of securities laws and fraud involving sales of residential
mortgage-backed securities. </p>
<p>The suit, filed in New York state court in Manhattan Dec.
7, accused the New York-based bank of negligent
misrepresentation, alleging the sales were based on false and
misleading statements. Damages should be determined at trial,
according to the filing. </p>
<p>ABP purchased securities that were far riskier than had
been represented, backed by mortgage loans worth significantly
less than had been represented and that had been made by
borrowers who were much less creditworthy than had been
represented, ABP said. </p>
<p>Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined
to comment about the lawsuit. </p>
<p>The Heerlen, Netherlands-based pension fund sued Deutsche
Bank AG over similar allegations in New York State Supreme Court
in September. ABP serves as the pension fund for Dutch public
educational and government workers and has more than 250 billion
euros ($332.8 billion) in assets under management, according to
the complaint. </p>

<p>Lawsuits/Pretrial </p>
<p>HSBC Allowed by Judge to Join JPMorgan in Madoff Appeals </p>
<p>HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) can join JPMorgan Chase  Co. and UBS AG
in appeals of decisions dismissing most of the lawsuits brought
by the trustee liquidating Bernard L. Madoff Investment
Securities Inc., a judge ruled. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in July dismissed most of
the Madoff trustee''s $9 billion suit against London-based HSBC.
In November, U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon threw out most
of the trustee''s $19 billion suit against New York-based
JPMorgan and dismissed most of the suit against UBS. </p>
<p>The two judges ruled on the same grounds, accepting the
banks'' arguments that the claims underlying the trustee''s suits
could only be brought by individual Madoff creditors. </p>
<p>Irving Picard, the Madoff trustee, couldn''t appeal
immediately because neither judge dismissed all of the suits. To
lift the bar to appeal, McMahon previously entered a final
judgment in the JPMorgan case, allowing Picard to seek a review
by a U.S. Court of Appeals. </p>
<p>Yesterday, at the request of HSBC, Rakoff did the same by
entering a final dismissal judgment so Picard can appeal. HSBC
said it wanted to have its case heard at the same time as
JPMorgan''s. </p>
<p>The HSBC case lacked factors that might lead the court to
deny such relief in Picard''s suit against New York Mets owners
Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz, Rakoff said. In September, Rakoff
knocked out about $700 million of the $1 billion in claims in
the Wilpon case and scheduled a jury trial for March. </p>
<p>Rakoff said he is still considering whether to allow Picard
to appeal his decision that the trustee can only sue to recover
fictitious profits that customers took out within two years of
the Madoff firm''s bankruptcy. Picard sought to go back six years
in disgorging bogus profits from the Ponzi scheme. </p>
<p>Picard argued in court papers that Rakoff should allow an
immediate appeal because another district judge disagreed with
Rakoff''s conclusion that suits can only look back two years.
Until the question on timing is resolved, hundreds of suits by
the trustee against customers are in limbo. </p>
<p>The HSBC suit in U.S. District Court is Picard v. HSBC Bank
Plc, 11-763, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). The UBS suit in district court is Picard v. UBS AG (UBSN),
11-04213, in the same court. The JPMorgan lawsuit in district
court is Picard v. JPMorgan Chase  Co., 11-00913, in the same
court. The JPMorgan lawsuit in bankruptcy court was Picard v.
JPMorgan Chase  Co., 10-04932, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern

<p>Samsung Loses Bid to Block Apple IPhone 4S Sales in France </p>
<p>Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) failed to win a court order
blocking Apple Inc. (AAPL) from selling its newest smartphone, the
iPhone 4S, in France. </p>
<p>The Paris court rejected Samsung''s request for an emergency
order against Apple while it considers the South Korean
company''s patent-infringement claims. </p>
<p>Samsung, the biggest maker of smartphones, sought to block
sales of the new handset in France, Italy and the U.K. days
after it was unveiled in October, arguing Apple violated its
wireless-communications patents. Suwon, South Korea-based
Samsung sued in Paris in July over earlier versions of the
iPhone and Apple''s iPad tablet. </p>
<p>The disproportionate character of the ban sought by
Samsung against Apple is clear, Judge Marie-Christine
Courboulay said in the decision yesterday. </p>
<p>The Paris court ruled Samsung must pay Apple 100,000 euros
($134,100) for legal fees while denying Apple''s request for
damages. Samsung''s claim wasn''t abusive and the company''s
infringement claims can move forward as a regular lawsuit,
Courboulay said. </p>
<p>Florence Catel, a Samsung spokeswoman in Paris, declined to
comment on the decision. Calls to Apple''s office in London for
comment weren''t immediately returned. </p>
<p>Samsung has been locked in a global legal battle with Apple
since the Cupertino, California-based company claimed in an
April suit that Samsung''s Galaxy devices copied the iPad and
iPhone. Samsung was the world''s biggest maker of smartphones in
the last quarter, while Apple dominates the tablet market. </p>

<p>Education Management Should Face Recruitment Suit, U.S. Says </p>
<p>Education Management Corp. (EDMC), the second-largest U.S. for-
profit college chain, should be forced to defend a lawsuit
alleging its recruiting policies helped the company wrongfully
secure more than $11 billion in student aid, government lawyers
said in a court filing. </p>
<p>U.S. officials have properly outlined claims that
Pittsburgh-based Education Management created an illegal
compensation system for admission recruiters to ensure a steady
flow of students who receive government aid to pay college
expenses, Justice Department attorneys said in the filing made
public yesterday. </p>
<p>EDMC''s unlawful compensation scheme emanates from the
highest levels of the corporation and represents a conscious
effort to do exactly what federal regulations prohibit in
terms of providing bonuses to recruiters, the government said in
the filing in federal court in Pittsburgh opposing the firm''s
request to have the case thrown out. </p>
<p>For-profit colleges have been under scrutiny by Congress,
state lawmakers and attorneys general who are investigating
sales practices and students'' debt loads. Eleven states and the
District of Columbia joined the U.S. as plaintiffs in the case. </p>
<p>The government, which intervened in suits filed by two EDMC
whistleblowers, contends the company systematically violated
federal law by paying recruiters based on their success in
persuading prospective students to enroll in the for-profit
school. </p>
<p>EDMC argued in court filings that prosecutors haven''t
properly stated claims supporting allegations that the
institution started a companywide campaign to defraud the
government and violate Department of Education regulations. </p>
<p>We are reviewing the governments'' responses to EDMC''s
motion to have the court dismiss this lawsuit, and we will have
an opportunity to file a reply with the court, Bonnie
Campbell, a legal adviser to the company, said in an e-mailed
statement. Based on what we have seen, we continue to believe
the case should be dismissed. </p>

<p>Pfizer Wins Review of Punitive-Damages Award in Prempro Case </p>
<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s largest drugmaker, persuaded a
Pennsylvania appeals court to review an $8.6 million punitive-
damages award to a woman who blamed her cancer on the company''s
menopause drugs. </p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments by
Pfizer''s Wyeth unit that a judge erred in letting a Philadelphia
jury award punishment damages to Mary Daniel, a former bank
manager from Arkansas who sued the drugmaker alleging its
Prempro pills caused her breast cancer. Jurors also awarded
Daniel more than $1.6 million in compensatory damages on her
claim. </p>
<p>More than 6 million women took Prempro and related
menopause drugs to treat symptoms such as hot flashes and mood
swings before a 2002 study highlighted their links to cancer.
Wyeth''s sales of the medicines, which are still on the market,
topped $2 billion before the release of the Women''s Health
Initiative, a National Institutes of Health-sponsored study. </p>
<p>The company is pleased the Pennsylvania Supreme Court
will hear the company''s appeal regarding whether punitive
damages are warranted, Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said
in an e-mailed statement yesterday. The company has said all
along that Wyeth acted responsibly in its handling of the
drug, he added. </p>
<p>Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Premarin,
Wyeth''s estrogen-based drug, with progestin-laden Provera, made
by Pfizer''s Upjohn unit, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth
combined the two hormones in its Prempro pill. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s Wyeth and Pharmacia  Upjohn units have lost 10 of
the 18 Prempro cases that juries have considered since trials
began in 2006. The most recent verdict came this week when a
Philadelphia jury awarded three women more than $72 million in
damages on their claims over the drugmaker''s hormone-replacement
medications. </p>
<p>We are pleased the court declined to consider any issue
relating to Wyeth''s negligence in causing her breast cancer or
Mrs. Daniel''s compensatory award, Zoe Littlepage, one of the
woman''s lawyers, said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. </p>
<p>The case is Daniel v. Wyeth, 040602368, Court of Common
Pleas (Philadelphia). </p>

<p>Oddball'' Hedge-Fund Friend Chose Stocks, Sidhu Tells Court </p>
<p>Rupinder Sidhu, who is accused of insider trading, said he
had no idea stock tips from his eccentric friend at hedge
fund AKO Capital LLP were based on confidential information. </p>
<p>Prosecutors allege AKO trader Anjam Ahmad told Sidhu when
the fund was about to place large buy or sell orders so Sidhu
could benefit from the effect on the shares. The pair split
profits of about 500,000 pounds ($783,500) from spread bets on
companies including Julius Baer Group Ltd., Swatch Group AG (UHR) and
Michael Page International Plc (MPI) between June and August 2009, the
U.K. Financial Services Authority said in a London trial. </p>
<p>I didn''t know about any AKO orders, Sidhu testified
yesterday. I was basing my trades on Ahmad''s decisions and his
rationale. </p>
<p>Sidhu denies 23 counts of insider trading and one money-
laundering charge for which he''s on trial. The 40-year-old
management consultant from Osterley, West London, admitted
contacting Ahmad using unregistered mobile phones and instant-
messaging accounts under false names to discuss trades. In one
MSN Messenger conversation, they made a coded reference to a
potential purchase as a party. </p>
<p>Sidhu told jurors this was because he wanted to keep the
spread betting secret from his family, who banned the practice
after he racked up heavy trading losses in 2008. Ahmad told
Sidhu his contract with AKO prevented him from trading for
himself. </p>
<p>Ahmad, a former equity strategist at Citigroup Inc. (C), was a
gifted mathematician who was known for being quirky and
eccentric and an oddball, Sidhu said in testimony Dec. 7.
They had been friends since secondary school and Sidhu regularly
sought his advice on trading. </p>

<p>Verdicts/Settlements </p>
<p>Pfizer Settles Prempro Case After Losing $72.6 Million Verdict </p>
<p>Pfizer Inc., the world''s largest drugmaker, agreed to
settle claims that its menopause drugs caused cancer in three
women who won a $72.6 million jury award earlier this week, a
lawyer said. </p>
<p>The New York-based company agreed to resolve claims by
Susan Elfont, Bernadette Kalenkoski and Judy Mulderig that
hormone-replacement drugs made by two Pfizer units caused their
breast cancer, Ted Meadows, a lawyer for the women, said in an
interview yesterday. A Philadelphia jury awarded the three women
$72.6 million in compensatory damages on Dec. 6. </p>
<p>They''re just glad to be able to go on with their lives,
said Meadows, who declined to disclose the amounts of the
settlements because they are confidential. </p>
<p>The accord comes a day before jurors were to begin hearing
testimony in a second phase of the case. The panel would have
been asked to decide whether Pfizer should face punitive damages
over its handling of the menopause drugs. </p>
<p>The parties have entered into a mutual agreement to
resolve this case under confidential terms, Chris Loder, a
Pfizer spokesman, said in a telephone interview. The earlier
verdict will be set aside as part of the settlement, he said. </p>
<p>More than 6 million women took Prempro and related
menopause drugs to treat symptoms such as hot flashes and mood
swings before a 2002 study highlighted their links to cancer.
Wyeth''s sales of the medicines, which are still on the market,
topped $2 billion before the release of the Women''s Health
Initiative, a National Institutes of Health-sponsored study. </p>

<p>Garrett Bauer Pleads Guilty to Trading on Stolen Merger Tips </p>
<p>Garrett Bauer, a New York stock trader, pleaded guilty to
his role in an insider-trading scheme that the U.S. says
generated $37 million in illegal profits by relying on corporate
merger tips stolen from four law firms. </p>
<p>Bauer, 44, joined middleman Kenneth T. Robinson and
attorney Matthew H. Kluger in using nonpublic data to trade
ahead of more than 30 corporate transactions over 17 years, he
admitted in federal court in Newark, New Jersey. Robinson, who
cooperated with prosecutors, pleaded guilty in April. </p>
<p>In charging the men in April, prosecutors said the scheme
involved companies such as Sun Microsystems Inc., 3Com Corp. and
Acxiom Corp. They said Bauer made more than $30 million on the
scheme, while Robinson earned more than $875,000 and Kluger more
than $500,000. </p>
<p>After taking the lion''s share of the $37 million in
profits, Bauer now faces punishment for conduct that undermines
the fairness of our financial markets and the public''s trust in
the safety of its investments, U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said
in a statement. </p>
<p>Bauer admitted securities fraud, conspiracy to commit
securities fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and
obstruction of justice. He faces as many as 20 years in prison
on the fraud and obstruction counts when he is sentenced March
13. He forfeited cash and property worth more than $23 million. </p>
<p>Bauer, who is free on $4 million bail, regrets his actions
and has been giving lectures to students and traders about
insider trading, said his attorney Michael Bachner. He has
spoken at business schools, law schools, churches and synagogues
to audiences ranging from 20 to 200 people, Bachner said. </p>
<p>The cases are U.S. v. Bauer, 11-mj-03536, and U.S. v.
Robinson, 11-cr-00223, U.S. District Court, District of New
Jersey (Newark). </p>

<p>Wells Fargo to Pay $148 Million in Muni Bid-Rigging Case </p>
<p>Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) agreed to pay $148 million to settle
criminal charges and civil claims for conspiring to overcharge
state and local governments on investments, becoming the fourth
bank to enter a settlement in the case. </p>
<p>The deal will resolve investigations into Wachovia Bank,
which Wells Fargo acquired in 2008, by U.S. agencies, including
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice
Department, as well as attorneys general in 26 states, the
Justice Department said in a statement. </p>
<p>The case is the latest in a more than five-year
investigation into how Wall Street banks conspired with local-
government advisers to reap excessive fees on investments sold
to public agencies by rigging competitive auctions and carving
up the market among themselves. JPMorgan Chase  Co., UBS AG and
Bank of America Corp. (BAC) previously settled similar cases. </p>
<p>Wachovia won bids by playing an elaborate game of you
scratch my back and I''ll scratch yours,'' rather than engaging in
legitimate competition to win municipalities'' business, Robert
Khuzami, director of the SEC''s Division of Enforcement, said in
a statement. </p>
<p>The settlement by Wells Fargo will bring to $673 million
the amount that banks have paid to settle the case, some of
which is being returned to localities that were overcharged in
the scheme. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, said the conduct was
by former employees of Wachovia before its acquisition. About
$59 million from the settlement will go to state attorneys
general, the bank said. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo is pleased to have fully resolved this
investigation of Wachovia Bank, the bank said in a statement. </p>
<p>The charges are connected to investment contracts that
states and cities bought with proceeds raised in the $3.7
trillion municipal-bond market, allowing them to earn a return
until the cash is needed for public-works projects. </p>

<p>KME, Halcor Lose EU Top Court Challenges of Antitrust Fines </p>
<p>KME Group SpA (KME) and Greek metals processor Halcor SA (XAKO) lost
European Union top court appeals over cartel fines. </p>
<p>The antitrust penalties against the companies should stand,
the EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg said in rulings yesterday. </p>
<p>KME appealed fines levied in two separate cartels in 2003
and in 2004, respectively. A lower EU court in 2009 rejected the
company''s first challenge to the 2003 fine of 39.8 million euros
($53.3 million). In 2004, KME was fined 67.1 million euros and
Halcor 9.16 million euros in another cartel. Halcor''s fine was
cut to 8.25 million euros by a lower EU court in 2010. </p>
<p>The European Commission, the 27-nation EU''s antitrust
regulator, fined three companies in 2003, including Outokumpu
Oyj (OUT1V) and Wieland-Werke AG, a total of 79 million euros for a
cartel between 1988 and 2001 in the market for copper tubes used
in air conditioning and refrigeration. A few months later, the
regulator levied a 222.3 million-euro penalty on companies
including KME and Halcor in the water, heating and gas tubes
market. </p>
<p>Yesterday''s ruling confirms the lower court''s decision
which largely backed the EU antitrust authority, the Brussels-
based regulator said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Halcor will examine the ruling and has already set aside 5
million euros to cover part of the fine, according to a filing
the company made to the Athens bourse. Francesco Giubilei, a
spokesman for Florence, Italy-based KME said he couldn''t comment
because it''s a national holiday. </p>
<p>The cases are: C-272/09 P, KME and Others v. European
Commission, C-389/10 P, KME Germany and Others v. Commission. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE)''s blood-cancer drug
Mylotarg, pulled from the market last year after it was linked
to deaths, helped a different group of patients, a study found. </p>
<p>Patients newly diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia who
received Mylotarg with chemotherapy lived for 25 months after
treatment, compared with 15 months for those given chemotherapy
alone, according to the study released today at the American
Society of Hematology meeting in San Diego. Mylotarg had
previously been used in patients ages 60 and older only after
their cancer had returned. </p>
<p>Pfizer, the world''s biggest drugmaker, will talk with U.S.
regulators about whether the medicine may return to the market,
said Mace Rothenberg, senior vice president of clinical
development and medical affairs for the New York-based company''s
oncology unit. </p>
<p>We are working closely with investigators to better
understand the findings from this study, Rothenberg said in a
telephone interview. The next step would be taking these data
forward as a potential new submission, working with regulators,
if we choose to go that path, he said. </p>
<p>The study results may presage new life for what was an $83
million product in 2009, according to Evaluate Pharma. </p>
<p>Pfizer pulled the drug in June 2010 after 10 years on the
market. The Food and Drug Administration requested the company
stop selling the therapy after a clinical trial showed it didn''t
help patients and was tied to deaths from liver complications. </p>
<p>Expedited Review </p>
<p>Mylotarg was approved in 2000 under an expedited review
process, which requires companies to conduct follow-up studies.
One such trial that began in 2004 was stopped early after
patients died and others didn''t appear to benefit. Pfizer
obtained Mylotarg in 2009 when it bought Wyeth. </p>
<p>The drug originally was approved for patients 60 and older
who had a relapse of acute myeloid leukemia, a blood cancer that
begins growing in the bone marrow. The disease will be diagnosed
in 13,000 people in the U.S. this year and has a five-year
survival rate of 23 percent, according to the National
Institutes of Health. </p>
<p>Mylotarg was the first therapy approved to treat patients
whose cancer had returned and was the first drug to be withdrawn
after winning approval under the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration''s accelerated review program. </p>
<p>The study released today involved 280 patients ages 50 to
70 who were first diagnosed with the disease. The group was
treated with chemotherapy and some patients also received
Mylotarg. </p>
<p>Treatment Dosage </p>
<p>Pfizers''s drug was given to patients over a week, in 3
milligram increments, said Sylvie Castaigne, the principal
investigator. We used a small dose, and repeated the dose a
short intervals, said Castaigne, a professor in the department
of hematology at Hpital de Versailles in Versailles, France. </p>
<p>Next will be to test the drug in younger patients,
because we know that younger patients respond better than older
patients to chemotherapy, Castaigne said in a telephone
interview from San Francisco. Researchers also examine whether
they can get similar results with a lower dose. We are right
at the limit of toxicity now, she said. </p>
<p>The drug must be resubmitted to the FDA with the new data
before it could return to the U.S. market, Rothenberg said. </p>
<p>Our knowledge is always moving forward, and sometimes we
may not always have the best insights of how best to use the
drug when it first arrives, he said. In this case, it was
right on that margin, and it fell back. Now it''s just a question
of finding that right dose in the right patients, and clearly
demonstrating a benefit. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) can''t ask a court in
Singapore to block investors there from suing outside the
country over their losses on $154.7 million in synthetic
collateralized debt obligations, a judge in New York ruled. </p>
<p>The New York-based bank''s attempt is vexatious, U.S.
District Judge Leonard Sand said yesterday, granting a request
by investors including the Singapore Government Staff Credit
Cooperative Society Ltd. to stop Morgan Stanley from seeking a
Singapore High Court order. </p>
<p>Several Morgan Stanley units created a classic bait and
switch scheme secretly designed to benefit Morgan Stanley at
customers'' expense, according to the lawsuit filed in October
2010. The investors claim Morgan Stanley didn''t tell them it was
a counter-party to the agreements, meaning that for each dollar
the investors lost, the bank gained a dollar. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley disagrees with the ruling and its Singapore
court action was entirely appropriate, Hong Kong-based spokesman
Nick Footitt said today. </p>
<p>This dispute involved plaintiffs who are all based in
Singapore, who purchased notes in Singapore, and who
contractually agreed to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Singapore courts, he said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, which had sought to have the investors''
lawsuit thrown out because the Monetary Authority of Singapore
investigated the sale of structured financial products and
created a resolution system, this month denied any wrongdoing. </p>
<p>Fare Better'' </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley has a sense they would fare better in
Singapore, said Eugene Tan, assistant professor of law at the
Singapore Management University. </p>
<p>Any alleged misstatements by Morgan Stanley on the notes
were mere puffery or were vague statements of optimism, the
bank said in a court filing. Defendants had no duty to
disclose the allegedly omitted information. </p>
<p>In October, Sand dismissed some of the investors'' claims
and permitted the rest of the case to go forward. One month
later, Morgan Stanley asked the Singapore court for an order
blocking the investors from pursuing the case. </p>
<p>Rather than availing themselves of the remedies available
here, defendants are attempting to require the plaintiffs to
begin anew in Singapore, Sand said yesterday in his ruling. He
also denied the New York-based bank''s request that he certify
his October decision for pretrial appeal. </p>
<p>Pinnacle Notes </p>
<p>The plaintiffs seek to represent a class of all investors
who bought the Pinnacle Notes from Aug. 1, 2006, to the end of
2007. </p>
<p>A group of investors in Singapore last month lost a bid to
recoup losses on Lehman-related products with an appeal court in
the city state ruling that the principle of caveat emptor
applies equally to literates and illiterates, using the Latin
phrase for buyer beware.'''' </p>
<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore banned 10 financial
institutions from selling structured investments in 2009
following claims by investors that they were misled on products
tied to Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. </p>
<p>The authority lifted the ban last year after the
institutions boosted internal procedures of their advisory
services across all investment products. </p>
<p>Tan said the disputes surrounding collateralized debt
obligations were unique. </p>
<p>I don''t think investors are going to have a different
investment climate in Singapore based on this lawsuit against
Morgan Stanley, he said. </p>
<p>The case is Dandong v. Pinnacle Performance Ltd., 10-
cv-08086, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the largest
software maker, replaced Andy Lees as head of its Windows Phone
Division after losing share to Google Inc. (GOOG) in the market for
mobile operating systems. </p>
<p>Terry Myerson, a vice president, will take charge of the
division, while Lees takes on a new role, reporting to Chief
Executive Officer Steve Ballmer, Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft said in an e-mail posted to its website. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s share of the market for mobile-phone operating
systems dropped to 1.5 percent in the third quarter from 2.7
percent a year earlier, according to Gartner Inc. Share for
Google''s Android more than doubled to 53 percent from 25 percent
in the same period. Ballmer, in the blog posting, thanked Lees
for his contributions to the phone team. </p>
<p>Myerson will be in charge of operations including Windows
Phone development and marketing, Ballmer said. Lees, who will
retain his title of president, will work with Ballmer on Windows
Phone and the coming Windows 8 software designed for tablets,
the company said. </p>
<p>They''re trying to deliver this whole seamless experience
across devices and they''re probably better off having one person
trying to oversee that, said Sid Parakh, an analyst at McAdams
Wright Ragen in Seattle. </p>
<p>Share Losses to Google </p>
<p>Microsoft is aiming to regain share lost to Android and
Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s iPhone with updated software and a partnership with
handset maker Nokia Oyj. (NOK1V) Apple had 15 percent of the mobile-
software market last quarter, while Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) had
11 percent share, according to Gartner. </p>
<p>Ballmer''s deputies are also working on Windows 8 to run
tablet machines capable of rivaling Apple''s iPad. </p>
<p>Myerson, who joined Microsoft in 1997, had previously
overseen Windows Phone engineering. He was shifted to that role
from Microsoft''s Exchange e-mail product as the company decided
to scrap previous work on Windows Mobile and redo phone software
to better appeal to consumers in the wake of the iPhone''s
success. </p>

<p>Thomas Lee, chief U.S. equity
strategist at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), estimated the Standard 
Poor''s 500 Index will rally to 1,430 next year and recommended
financial stocks. </p>
<p>Lee''s forecast is 14 percent higher than the closing level
on Dec. 9 of 1,255.19. He estimated combined profit by companies (SPX)
in the benchmark equity gauge will be $105 a share in 2012 and
$110 in 2013. Based on his projection for earnings in 2013, the
SP 500 will trade at a price-earnings multiple of 13 times,
according to a note dated Dec. 9. </p>
<p>The consensus view is that visibility remains murky and
with significant tail risks such as Europe''s debt crisis and
fiscal tightening in China, Lee said. 2012 may look a bit like
2009, he wrote. Emergence from a financial crisis and the
potential for acceleration of the business cycle driven by
Europe exiting a recession and China easing may boost cyclical
stocks. Financials, which may be helped by Republican gains in
the U.S. election, are his top pick, he said. </p>
<p>Financials have plunged 21 percent in 2011, the most of the
10 groups in the SP 500 (SPXL1), as investors fled banks and insurers
on concern Europe''s debt crisis will spread. Material and
industrial shares had the next biggest declines, falling 13
percent and 5 percent, respectively. In 2009, from the SP 500''s
bottom on March 9, 2009, through the end of the year, financials
surged 131 percent, while consumer discretionary, industrials
and materials jumped at least 83 percent. </p>
<p>Lee''s SP 500 estimate is the second-highest of 11
strategists surveyed by Bloomberg, who on average forecast the
measure will climb to 1,350 next year. </p>
<p>The SP 500 fell 1.5 percent to 1,236.47 at 4 p.m. New York
time. The measure has lost 1.7 percent in 2011. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s largest
drugmaker, authorized a new share buyback program for as much as
$10 billion as Lipitor lost about 15 percent of its market in
the first week the cholesterol pill faced generic competition. </p>
<p>The quarterly dividend was increased to 22 cents a share
from 20 cents, according to a statement today. The stock
repurchase plan is in addition to Pfizer''s existing program, the
New York-based company said. Chief Executive Officer Ian Read,
58, also was named board chairman. </p>
<p>Pfizer lost U.S. patent protection on its biggest seller,
the Lipitor cholesterol pill, at the end of last month. Generic
versions of the drug accounted for about 15 percent of the
Lipitor market in the week ended December 2, the first week
copies were available, according to a report today from Chris Schott, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) </p>
<p>The buyback is on first thought higher than what most
people were anticipating, said Damien Conover, an analyst at
Morningstar Inc. (MORN) in Chicago, in a telephone interview. It will
be viewed as a positive by the investment community. </p>
<p>Pfizer has been working to minimize losses from Lipitor by
making deals with insurers to block the use of generic versions
in exchange for lowering the price of branded Lipitor. </p>
<p>This is a very complicated generic launch, the way Pfizer
is going after retaining share, this is rather unprecedented,
said Conover. It is probably a little too early to tell how
well the company will do in holding off generics. </p>
<p>New Repurchase Plan </p>
<p>Under its existing program, Pfizer had repurchased $6.5
billion of shares as of November 1, and it anticipates
repurchasing between $7 billion and $9 billion this year, said
Joan Campion, a spokeswoman for Pfizer, in a phone interview. </p>
<p>Under the new repurchase program Pfizer plans to buy about
$5 billion of its stock in 2012 with the rest of the $10 billion
amount available in 2013 and beyond, the company said in its
statement. </p>
<p>The dividend increase and new share repurchase program
are a testament to our continued commitment to enhancing
shareholder value and to our continued confidence in the
business, Read said in a statement. </p>
<p>Read took over the board chairman position from George Lorch, who will become an independent director, the company said
in a separate statement. Read became CEO after Jeffrey Kindler
resigned as chief executive officer and chairman in December
2010. Lorch was named to the board post a few days later. </p>
<p>Pfizer shares declined less than 1 percent to $20.39 at
4:00 p.m. New York time. </p>

Dividend Growth Advisors is a closely held money-management

<p>Goldman Sachs Asset Management, which has $821 billion in

<p>The fund''s reorganization must be approved by its

<p>The Rising Dividend fund has advanced at an average annual

<p>Russian political risk sparked by
ballot-rigging allegations in parliamentary elections may remain
repellent for stocks for months to come, even after
nationwide protests ended peacefully, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) said. </p>
<p>Large-scale political protests have taken their toll on
the market, with Russia massively underperforming global
emerging market peers in the past week, said Alex Kantarovich,
a strategist at JPMorgan in Moscow, in an e-mailed note today. </p>
<p>President Dmitry Medvedev said yesterday he ordered an
investigation into allegations of electoral fraud in the Dec. 4
elections to parliament, which was won by the dominant United
Russia party that he and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin promoted.
About 25,000 people gathered in near-freezing weather in central
Moscow the day before to protest the results of elections, with
tens of thousands more doing the same in St. Petersburg and
other major cities, according to police. </p>
<p>The Micex Index rallied today, rising 1.5 percent, the most
this month, to 1,416.49 at 12:49 p.m., after nationwide protests
Dec. 10 concluded peacefully. That measure tumbled 7.3 percent
last week, the most in almost three months, as earlier protests
led to the detention of hundreds of activists. </p>
<p>The protests will probably continue sporadically into the 
first quarter of 2012, yet fail to broaden, JPMorgan said. </p>
<p>The most likely scenario is that Putin''s plan to return to
the Kremlin in the March vote for president will go according to
plan and stocks will experience a drag until then,
Kantarovich said. </p>

<p>Mark Machin, who ran Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)''s investment banking business in Asia for six years,
is leaving after two decades with the company. </p>
<p>Machin, 45, is stepping down from his position as vice-
chairman for the Asia-Pacific region excluding Japan, according
to an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg News. Edward Naylor, a
spokesman for the firm in Hong Kong, confirmed the contents of
the document. </p>
<p>A Goldman Sachs partner since 2002, Machin is considering
taking a position with an investment business, two people with
knowledge of the matter said, asking not to be identified as no
final decision has been made. He will move to Hong Kong from
Beijing in January, one of the people said. </p>
<p>Machin is the most senior manager at Goldman Sachs''s
investment bank in Asia to depart since Ravi Sinha, co-head of
the division for the region, stepped down in April 2010. Yusuf Alireza, the New York-based firm''s co-president of operations
for the Asia-Pacific region outside Japan, left last month. </p>
<p>Machin, who trained as a doctor at Oxford University before
joining Goldman Sachs, moved to Beijing from Hong Kong in 2009
to oversee the expansion of the advisory business in China,
which was the world''s biggest generator of initial public
offering fees last year according to researcher Freeman  Co. </p>
<p>Top MA Adviser </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is the second-largest arranger of stock and
convertible bond sales overseas by Chinese companies this year
behind Morgan Stanley and is third in advising on mergers, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The firm ranks 29th in the league
table for domestic equity and convertible bond offerings. </p>
<p>For the first time since 2004, Goldman Sachs this year
captured the top spot among arrangers of equity and equity-
linked offerings in the Asia-Pacific region outside Japan,
according to Bloomberg data. The firm also ranks first in
mergers advisory in the region. </p>
<p>Machin, who became regional co-head of investment banking
in 2005, stepped down from that position in February. In that
role he had worked with William Wicker, Richard Ong and Sinha,
all former co-heads of investment banking in Asia who left the
firm as partners. </p>
<p>David Ryan, who was previously co-head of investment
banking for Asia together with Machin, became sole president of
Goldman Sachs''s operations in the region when Alireza left. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) reached a settlement
with MBIA Inc. (MBI) over credit-default swaps that led to billions of
dollars of losses for the bank, agreeing to terminate the
contracts and drop a challenge to the insurer''s restructuring. </p>
<p>MBIA will make a $1.1 billion cash payment to Morgan
Stanley as part of the settlement, according to a person
familiar with the agreement who asked not to be named because
the amount hasn''t been made public. Morgan Stanley will take a
$1.2 billion loss this quarter related to the deal, the New
York-based bank said today in a statement. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s exposure to MBIA, and its attempts to
hedge those risks, have resulted in losses of about $3 billion
since the start of 2008, not including today''s announcement. The
settlement will increase Morgan Stanley''s capital, boosting the
Tier 1 common ratio under new rules by about 75 basis points,
according to the statement. </p>
<p>It''s critical that we reposition for the new regulatory
environment and do so quickly, Morgan Stanley Chief Executive
Officer James Gorman said in the statement. A top priority for
2011 was to address this large outstanding legacy exposure and
this settlement is consistent with our efforts to build capital
and de-risk the balance sheet. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley fell 21 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $15.17 at
4:15 p.m. in New York, after climbing as much as 7.6 percent.
MBIA increased 0.7 percent to $11.48. </p>
<p>MBIA Hedges </p>
<p>The bank''s loss will come from writing down the value of
the swap contracts with MBIA. Morgan Stanley had $4.9 billion of
gross derivative counterparty risk to MBIA as of Sept. 30, and
$2.7 billion after credit valuation adjustments, according to
its quarterly filing with the SEC. The bank also had about $700
million of hedges against MBIA. </p>
<p>The agreement removes a legal headache, and should give a
boost to Morgan''s balance-sheet efficiency Glenn Schorr, an
analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc., said in a note to investors.
The deal could also cause the firm''s CDS spread to tighten as
earnings volatility should decline, Schorr said. </p>
<p>MBIA, based in Armonk, New York, will withdraw a suit
against Morgan Stanley relating to $223 million of residential
mortgage-backed securities. Morgan Stanley plans to end its
participation in litigation challenging the split of the
insurer''s business. </p>
<p>This settlement is good for Morgan Stanley, good for MBIA
and good for the markets and our financial system, allowing
firms to move forward and rebuild, Benjamin Lawsky, New York
state''s financial services superintendent, said in a separate
statement. </p>
<p>Kevin Brown, a spokesman for MBIA, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Bank of America </p>
<p>The settlement significantly reduces Morgan Stanley''s
risk-weighted assets under new rules from the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision, known as Basel III, according to the
statement. Morgan Stanley had a Basel III Tier 1 common ratio of
more than 7 percent as of Sept. 30, and the increase brings it
closer to the range of 8 percent to 10 percent the firm said it
planned to reach by the end of 2012. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s MBIA exposure would have accounted for as
much as 15 percent of the firm''s risk-weighted assets under
Basel III, and the risk may have lasted for more than 10 years,
Howard Chen, a Credit Suisse Group AG analyst, wrote in a note
to investors. </p>
<p>Buyback Speculation </p>
<p>The deal increases the likelihood that Morgan Stanley will
buy back shares or increase the dividend next year, according to
Ed Najarian, an analyst at International Strategy  Investment
Group Inc. Morgan Stanley has authorization for $1.6 billion of
share repurchases. The firm hasn''t bought back any stock in the
first nine months of this year, and would need regulatory
approval to do so. </p>
<p>Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the second-biggest U.S. lender by
assets, made a preliminary offer to MBIA earlier this year aimed
at settling their legal dispute tied to defective mortgages, two
people briefed on discussions said in July. The companies were
split on how much the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank would
have to pay to resolve the disagreement. </p>
<p>About two dozen banks and investment firms sued MBIA and
regulators after the 2009 split of its main bond-insurance unit
into two businesses. The division created a new company holding
the state and municipal-bond guarantee business the insurer
seeks to maintain, and left the old unit holding soured
mortgage-backed debt that caused them to be shut out of the
market. Lenders claimed the restructuring was a fraudulent
conveyance that rendered the old insurer, MBIA Insurance
Corp., insolvent. </p>
<p>Ending Lawsuits </p>
<p>Units of Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), Credit Agricole SA (ACA), KBC Groep
NV (KBC), HSBC Holdings Plc, and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc have
pulled out of the suits in the past four months, according to
court papers. Funds run by New York-based Fir Tree Partners
dropped out of a similar lawsuit by hedge funds and Third Avenue
Trust, also based in New York, ended a separate case in October.
Five of 18 banks that sued MBIA and the New York State Insurance
Department including UBS AG, BNP Paribas SA, and Bank of America
are still fighting the split. </p>
<p>The remaining plaintiff policyholders will continue to
fight to restore the billions fraudulently taken from MBIA
Insurance, Robert J. Giuffra, lead counsel for the banks and a
partner at Sullivan  Cromwell LLP in New York, said in a
separate statement. </p>
<p>Settlements </p>
<p>Banks have discontinued litigation as MBIA negotiates
settlements over the credit-default swaps it sold to the lenders
to protect against losses on mortgage securities and other debt.
MBIA said Nov. 10 that it had settled $10.6 billion of
transactions since Sept. 30 at an undisclosed cost, bringing the
amount of bets terminated this year to $23 billion. </p>
<p>The cost to protect against a default by the MBIA unit that
sold the guarantees fell. Credit-default swaps eased 8
percentage points to a mid-price of 35 percent upfront as of
9:37 a.m. in New York, according to broker Phoenix Partners
Group. That''s in addition to 5 percent a year, meaning it would
cost $3.5 million initially and $500,000 annually to protect $10
million of MBIA''s debt. </p>

<p>The liquidator of the MF Global Inc.
brokerage said that certain actions of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM),
a lender to the broker-dealer''s parent, are likely to be the
subject of investigation. </p>
<p>The trustee, James Giddens, said he would act with the
respect to those actions to recover money for brokerage
customers if necessary. If the bank received so-called
preferential payments before the brokerage went into
liquidation, or other payments, he would deal appropriately
with the transfers or other issues, he said. </p>
<p>HHR may threaten or bring an action against JPM in the
context of a potential dispute between the bank and the
brokerage, he said in a court filing yesterday. Giddens''s law
firm is Hughes Hubbard  Reed LLP, or HHR. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, was agent for a $1.2
billion loan to the broker-dealer''s parent, and also for a $300
million loan to the brokerage, according to the filing. Giddens
made the statement about suing the bank after a judge asked him
if he was disinterested enough to litigate in light of past work
for JPMorgan. </p>
<p>The broker-dealer paid JPMorgan and the other secured
lenders back for the $300 million loan, Giddens said. He didn''t
know yet if the bank was still a creditor of the brokerage. </p>
<p>Not a Client </p>
<p>JPMorgan isn''t a current client of the law firm,
Giddens told the Manhattan federal judge. Giddens''s firm ended
minor patent and other work for JPMorgan and collected less
than $2,000 in fees from the bank in 2011 and less than $35,000
in 2009 and 2010, Giddens said. </p>
<p>The brokerage''s parent, MF Global Holdings Ltd., is in a
separate court proceeding. </p>
<p>Joseph Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to
comment on Gidden''s statement about lawsuits. </p>
<p>Three transfers of collateral made and pending will give
commodity customers about $4 billion of their assets, according
to court filings. Giddens is due to testify on his progress in
Washington today before the Senate Agriculture Committee. </p>
<p>The parent company''s Oct. 31 bankruptcy filing, the eighth-
largest in U.S. history, listed assets of $41 billion. Jon Corzine, the former co-chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., quit as MF Global''s CEO on Nov. 4. </p>
<p>The brokerage case is Securities Investor Protection Corp.
v. MF Global Inc., 11-02790, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). The parent''s bankruptcy case
is MF Global Holdings Ltd., 11-bk-15059, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan
Stanley (MS) are getting a chilly reception at top colleges,
including Harvard University and Princeton University, as campus
offshoots of Occupy Wall Street target investment-bank
recruiting events. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs canceled visits to Harvard and Brown
University last week following a November incident where Occupy
Harvard protesters attempted to enter a recruitment session.
Students at Yale University, Princeton and Cornell University
have also rallied at campus events by investment firms. </p>
<p>Students of the eight elite colleges composing the Ivy
League in the northeastern U.S., such as Sandra Korn of Harvard
and Tom Moore of Cornell, are criticizing their universities for
sending high numbers of graduates to Wall Street, rather than to
jobs that emphasize community service. Careers in financial and
consulting firms are frequently presented as the best or only
option, said Korn, a sophomore majoring in history of science
and gender studies who participated in the Nov. 28 protest. </p>
<p>It''s kind of frustrating for students who think this is
not the most ethical profession, Korn, 19, said in a telephone
interview. When some people are making money by taking risks
with other people''s lives and livelihoods, that''s detrimental to
society. </p>
<p>About 22 percent of Harvard 2011 graduates who planned to
enter the workforce were headed into finance and consulting,
down from a high of 47 percent in 2007, according to a Harvard
Crimson survey published in May. Half the students entering
those fields said they would have chosen to work in other
professions if salary weren''t a concern. </p>
<p>Targeting Blankfein </p>
<p>More than 11 percent were planning for jobs in education,
and one in four were ticketed for graduate programs, according
to the survey. </p>
<p>A Dec. 8 Goldman Sachs recruiting visit to the Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based university was canceled due to proximity
to the Reading Period and commencement of exams, according to
an e-mail obtained by Bloomberg News. A session days earlier on
Brown''s campus in Providence, Rhode Island, was scuttled hours
before it was to begin, the Brown Daily Herald reported Dec. 5.
Both sessions were rescheduled as Internet-based seminars. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School,
canceled an October appearance at Barnard College in New York.
Students at Columbia University, with which Barnard is
affiliated, organized a weeklong protest against Blankfein, the
Columbia Daily Spectator reported on its website. Barnard
President Debora L. Spar joined Goldman Sachs''s board in June. </p>
<p>West Coast Shipping </p>
<p>David Wells, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman Sachs,
declined to comment on the campus protests. </p>
<p>Protests spawned by the Occupy Wall Street movement that
began in September have focused attention on Americans who lost
homes and jobs as credit froze after the bankruptcy of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008, contributing to the worst
recession since the Great Depression, even as many U.S. banks
rebounded. The movement that began in a New York park has spread
to cities worldwide including Boston, London, Sydney and
Toronto. </p>
<p>Occupy demonstrators yesterday protested to halt shipping
operations at ports in Oakland and Long Beach, California, and
Portland, Oregon, where Goldman Sachs owns a stake in the
largest cargo-terminal operator. The economic value of
containerized cargo at West Coast ports is about $705 million a
day, according to Martin Associates, a Lancaster, Pennsylvania-
based consulting firm. </p>
<p>Job Opportunities </p>
<p>College students are saying that Wall Street banks haven''t
been held accountable for promoting the high-risk investments
that led to the financial crisis. </p>
<p>In general, they play a role in the crashing of the
economy and the broadening of the income distribution gap,
said Luciana Chamorro, a senior at Princeton. It''s the
maximization of profit at the expense of social equality. </p>
<p>Chamorro said she''s been disappointed by the focus on Wall
Street and consulting jobs among the opportunities presented by
the Princeton, New Jersey-based university''s career office. She
was among about 20 students who interrupted a Dec. 7 JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) recruitment session on campus to voice their
concern. There were about 25 students there who had come to
learn about the investment bank, and five people from the
company, three of them recent Princeton graduates, she said. </p>
<p>I don''t think we seemed threatening in any way to them,
she said. We both gave each other the space to say what we
were thinking and I think that was really good. </p>
<p>Yale''s Approach </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley experienced some peripheral protest
activity at an event at Yale in New Haven, Connecticut, last
month, said Jeanmarie McFadden, a spokeswoman for the firm. </p>
<p>We have not changed our recruitment activities and we
have not seen any impact on attendance, she said. </p>
<p>Yale respects the rights of students to protest peacefully,
said Allyson Moore, associate dean of Yale College and director
of career services. </p>
<p>None of the companies were distressed by it, Moore
said. They anticipated it. </p>
<p>About 11 percent of Yale undergraduates take jobs in
finance, less than the 18 percent that go to work in education,
Moore said. </p>
<p>Our philosophy is to support each individual student''s
career aspirations, Moore said. If they want a career in the
arts, we''ll do our level best to help them achieve that and if
they aspire to a career in business, we''ll work equally as
hard. </p>
<p>Public Service </p>
<p>Korn, the Harvard student, said she has slept in a tent in
Harvard Yard about 14 times as part of the Occupy protest. She
said she heard speeches by university President Drew Faust that
emphasized the importance of public-service careers. </p>
<p>Under Faust, Harvard has increased opportunities and
support for students seeking experiences and careers in public
service, said Jeff Neal, a university spokesman. Efforts last
year included a series of new Presidential Public Service
Fellowships. She has also said that the university''s next
fundraising campaign will include increasing summer public-
service opportunities, according to Neal. </p>
<p>On Nov. 28, Korn said she and about 25 other Occupy Harvard
protesters tried to enter the Goldman Sachs event. She said a
staff member told her group they couldn''t enter because they
weren''t properly dressed and didn''t have resumes. </p>
<p>The protesters remained outside, chanting anti-Goldman
Sachs slogans, she said. Students who had come to hear the
bank''s presentation were unhappy, she said. </p>
<p>There were certainly some students who were a little
annoyed, she said. </p>
<p>Strained Friendships </p>
<p>Colleges should consider banning corporate recruiting, as
they did military recruiters, as antithetical to the purposes of
a university, said Moore, the Cornell sophomore. </p>
<p>There''s a sense that they''re appealing to people who
don''t have a lot of options, that graduation is coming near and
debt is piling up, Moore said. People are becoming part of
this profoundly unjust institution because they don''t see an
alternative. </p>
<p>Moore said his views have caused friction with classmates
interested in Wall Street jobs. </p>
<p>I''ve definitely had some friendships strained, he said. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley lowered its price
forecasts for agricultural commodities including corn and wheat
because of rising global supplies. </p>
<p>Corn prices on the Chicago Board of Trade may average $6.60
a bushel in the 2011-12 marketing year, soybeans will average
$12.75 a bushel and wheat will average $6.70 a bushel, Morgan
Stanley said an e-mailed report today. The bank previously
forecast corn at $7.25, soybeans at $14.25 and wheat at $7.50. </p>
<p>We are lowering our price forecasts across the
agricultural commodities, accounting for higher global supply,
Morgan Stanley analysts led by Hussein Allidina in New York
wrote in the report. We still see upside to prices, as the
recent sell-off, particularly in corn and soybeans, is overdone
in the face of still-tight U.S. stocks and strong U.S. feed and
ethanol demand. </p>
<p>Corn futures are down 5.1 percent this year at $5.97 and
soybeans have dropped 20 percent to $11.155 in Chicago. Wheat
has declined 24 percent to $6.005 on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The drop in prices this year presents a buying opportunity,
according to the bank. </p>
<p>World wheat stockpiles will total 208.5 million metric
tons, up 2.9 percent from a November estimate, according to the
U.S. Department of Agriculture. The USDA raised its estimate for
corn inventories by 4.6 percent to 127.2 million tons and its
soybean stockpiles forecast by 1.5 percent to 64.5 million tons. </p>
<p>Grains lagged other commodities this year as the market
digests expectations of better-than-expected global supply,
Morgan Stanley said. The negative impact of this supply on
U.S. exports has sidelined concerns over poor U.S. production,
diverting the focus from still-tight U.S. balances. </p>
<p>Corn in the 2012-13 marketing year will average $5.75, down
from a prior forecast of $6, the bank estimates. Soybeans will
average $12.70, down from $13.50, and wheat will average $6.30,
down from the prior forecast of $7, Morgan Stanley said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, has lost at least 38 partners in
2011 as the firm heads toward the end of its worst year for
profit and share performance since 2008. </p>
<p>The number is an estimate based on internal memos, company
filings and news reports as the New York-based bank doesn''t
publicize departures. The company added nine partners from
outside the firm this year, including six when Goldman Sachs
took full control of its Australian joint venture. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, more than a dozen years since its initial
public offering, still promotes top performers every even-
numbered year to join a so-called partnership and share in a
bonus pool that''s envied on Wall Street. Partners swelled to 475
last year from 221 as of the IPO. They''re among the biggest
shareholders, with a combined stake of about 13.8 percent on
Nov. 20, up from 10.2 percent on Jan. 27, filings show. </p>
<p>I retired from GS after a fantastic 15 years entirely for
family reasons, Robert A. McTamaney, who was named partner in
2002, said in an e-mailed response to questions after confirming
that he stepped down in June. I plan to do something on my own
related to helping people manage their money. </p>
<p>The retirement of McTamaney, a U.S. citizen who helped run
the equities trading business in Asia after being co-head of
global foreign exchange and European emerging markets trading
from London, is among those that haven''t been reported. Others
include Ken N. Murphy, Dioscoro-Roy I. Ramos, Gary B. Schermerhorn, Devesh P. Shah and David H. Voon. </p>

got liquidity and can move out in a way that they couldn''t when
they were a partnership, said Jay W. Lorsch, a Harvard
Business School professor who helped run an education program
for new partners in the 1980s. It''s not a huge number of
retirements as it''s less than 10 percent of the total, he said. </p>
<p>Banks face new regulations and capital requirements that
may crimp profits. Protests, some aimed at Goldman Sachs, have
decried Wall Street bonuses after taxpayers rescued the
financial system in 2008. Demonstrators have disrupted bank
recruiting on college campuses and about 250 gathered this week
in front of the company''s headquarters chanting Take the ax to
Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs shares have dropped 45 percent this year and
net earnings tumbled 43 percent in the nine months ended Sept.
30. The company set aside $10 billion for compensation in the
first three quarters, enough to pay each worker $292,836 for the
period, down from $370,706 a year earlier. </p>
<p>Highest-Paid </p>
<p>Partners, typically the highest-paid employees, receive
most of their compensation in stock and must hold at least a
quarter of the after-tax shares they receive from the company
until they retire, according to a proxy statement. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs promoted 110 people to partner last year, the
second-largest class after 115 people were added in 2006. </p>
<p>The firm, with 34,200 employees at the end of September,
has said it aims to trim $1.2 billion in annual expenses, which
could lead to at least 1,000 job cuts. Some of the partner
departures, including retirements, may be tied to the cost-
saving effort. </p>
<p>New partners include Daniel P. Petrozzo, chief information
officer at Fidelity Investments before joining Goldman Sachs in
June, and Boston Consulting Group Chairman Carl Stern, 65, who
became a Chicago-based vice chairman in the investment-banking
division in September, according to company filings and LinkedIn
profiles. Ronald Hua, a citizen of the U.S. and Taiwan, joined
in September as chief investment officer and head of the
quantitative equity alpha business within asset management. </p>
<p>Class of 88 </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs doesn''t publish statistics on how many
partners leave each year and the company stopped announcing
partner promotions in press releases after 2006. David Wells, a
spokesman for the firm, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Five people who left or are leaving this year became
partners before the 1999 IPO, including Milton R. Berlinski, 55,
who heads the team that advises private-equity firms. Berlinski,
who became a partner in 1996, is stepping down at year-end, he
said in an interview today. </p>
<p>The departure of Kevin W. Kennedy, 63, who became partner
in 1984, leaves Goldman Sachs with two partners from that
decade, both from the class of 1988: Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 57, and John P. Curtin Jr., 61, a U.S. citizen who is the Toronto-based chairman and
CEO of the firm''s Canadian business. </p>
<p>Kennedy is one of four members of the management committee
who will be gone by year-end, along with Yusuf A. Alireza,
Edward C. Forst and Richard M. Ruzika. </p>
<p>Terribly Hard'' </p>
<p>The work is terribly hard and so people don''t stay around
usually in this line of work for all that long, Charles D. Ellis, author of the 2008 book The Partnership: The Making of
Goldman Sachs, said in a telephone interview. The intensity
gets to you. </p>
<p>Some partners who retire maintain ties to the company
through business relationships, alumni events or so-called
advisory-director or senior-director roles. An example is Joseph H. Gleberman, who worked at Goldman Sachs for more than 29 years
and became a partner in 1990. </p>
<p>Gleberman, who most recently was chief risk officer for the
company''s merchant-banking division, said he will serve as an
advisory director on the investment committee after retiring at
year-end. </p>
<p>I''ve had a very gratifying career at GS but I decided
that if I was going to have a significant next career
(unidentified as yet), now was the time to make the change, he
wrote in response to an e-mailed question. </p>

are leaving this year: </p>

<p>Chevron Phillips Chemical Co., a
joint venture equally owned by Chevron Corp. (CVX) and ConocoPhillips (COP),
will spend about $5 billion to build one of the first new
ethylene production facilities in the U.S. since 2001. </p>
<p>The company selected its site in Baytown, Texas, for new
factories to convert ethane into ethylene starting in 2017, The
Woodlands, Texas-based Chevron Phillips said today in a
statement. The cost includes an ethylene plant, known as a
cracker, capable of producing 1.5 million metric tons of the
gaseous chemical a year, and two plants for making polyethylene
plastic, said Melanie Samuelson, a company spokeswoman in an
interview. </p>
<p>The industry is investing in U.S. production of ethylene,
the most widely used petrochemical, as natural gas costs have
dropped. Ethane is derived from gas, which has dropped in price
as new technologies have boosted production from shale
formations. The U.S. has a cost advantage relative to producers
in Asia and Europe where ethylene is made from oil-derived
naphtha. </p>
<p>We are pleased that the development of shale-gas
resources in the U.S. has set the stage for major petrochemical
investment and job creation in our backyard, Peter L. Cella,
chief executive officer of Chevron Phillips, said in the
statement. The chemical company announced in March plans to
consider the project. </p>
<p>Pipeline Access </p>
<p>Chevron Phillips plans to convert ethylene from its new
cracker into 1 billion metric tons a year of polyethylene at
plants to be built at either the company''s Cedar Bayou site in
Baytown or at the nearby Sweeny site in Old Ocean. A final
selection will be made by March, the company said. Polyethylene
is a plastic used in grocery bags and food packaging. </p>
<p>Shaw Energy  Chemicals Ltd. is designing the ethane
cracker. Federal and state permit applications for air emissions
will be filed this week, with approvals anticipated in 2013,
according to the statement. </p>
<p>Chevron Phillips said it chose to build adjacent to an
existing cracker in Baytown, located about 30 miles (48
kilometers) east of downtown Houston, because the site has
access to ethane and ethylene pipelines and storage caverns, as
well as to the Mont Belvieu gas-processing hub. </p>
<p>The plants will employ 400 people and the construction
project will create 10,000 jobs, the company said. </p>
<p>Dow Chemical Co. (DOW), the world''s largest ethylene producer,
plans to spend $4 billion in the U.S. to build a Gulf Coast
cracker by 2017, two propylene plants and to reopen an idled
Louisiana cracker. Sasol Ltd. (SOL) may spend as much as $4.5 billion
to build a cracker and related plants in Louisiana. </p>
<p>LyondellBasell Industries NV is among companies expanding
existing U.S. facilities to benefit from low-cost ethane. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG)
should halt operations in Brazil and pay 20 billion reais ($10.7
billion) in damages after an oil spill last month, prosecutors
urged a federal court. </p>
<p>Chevron and Transocean weren''t capable of controlling the
damages from a spill of 3,000 barrels of oil, which proves a
lack of environmental planning and management, the federal
prosecutors'' office in Campos, Rio de Janeiro state, said today
in a statement on the Federal Public Ministry''s website. The
prosecutors didn''t say in which court the suit was filed. </p>
<p>Chevron, the second-largest U.S. crude producer after Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM), is being audited by Brazil''s petroleum regulator
for the oil leak at the Frade project off the coast of Rio de
Janeiro last month. Brazil has tightened safety conditions at
crude projects following the spill at BP Plc''s Macondo well in
the Gulf of Mexico last year. </p>
<p>Brazilian prosecutors said in today''s statement they are
asking a court to immediately suspend Chevron and Transocean''s
operations in the country and order a definitive halt after
assessing the case. A court must rule on the request and the
damages. </p>
<p>Transocean, the operator of the rig at Chevron''s Frade
project, continues to cooperate with the authorities, Guy
Cantwell, a spokesman, said in a telephone interview from
Houston. We haven''t seen anything in writing, he said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s U.K. arm
hired a French-speaking markets regulator from Britain''s
Financial Services Authority, as rule-setting powers move from
London to Paris and Brussels. </p>
<p>The bank hired Martine Doyon, a specialist in European
Union market rules and an international strategist for the
regulator, to head up its EU government-affairs department, an
FSA spokesman said in a telephone interview. She becomes at
least the ninth senior official to leave the regulator since the
government said in 2010 it would abolish the agency. </p>
<p>A French or German speaker is probably a good place to
start in recruiting a lobbyist, Fred Ponzo, an adviser on
capital-markets regulation at Greyspark Partners, said in a
telephone interview in London. A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs
declined to comment. </p>
<p>The EU, led by its internal markets commissioner and the
former French foreign minister, Michel Barnier, is in the
process of overhauling laws governing financial firms, including
a review of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and
derivatives legislation. The Paris-based European Securities and
Markets Authority was set up earlier this year to harmonize
implementation of the new market rules across the 27 nations. </p>
<p>The hire comes after the U.K. regulator lost Alan Cathcart,
a senior official who worked on banking stress tests, to HSBC
Holdings Plc. (HSBA) </p>
<p>EY, JPMorgan </p>
<p>Thomas Huertas, formerly the head of the U.K. watchdog''s
international group, is set to start work at accounting firm
Ernst  Young in January. Sally Dewar, the FSA managing director
for risk, resigned last year to join JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) </p>
<p>The FSA restructured into two divisions to prepare for a
government-mandated handover of lender supervision to the Bank
of England and the creation of the Financial Conduct Authority. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley''s (MS) $4.7 billion real-
estate fund, known as MSREF VII, will probably win approval to
extend the deadline for finding new investments into 2013, a
person familiar with the discussions said. </p>
<p>Investors in Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund VII have
indicated they will allow the New York-based company to approve
extending by one year the June 2012 deadline in exchange for
lower management fees and a $700 million reduction in its size,
according to the person, who declined to be named because the
talks are private. </p>
<p>MSREF VII closed fundraising in June 2010, raising less
than half the $10 billion target it had before the financial
crisis after steep declines in previous Morgan Stanley funds and
a falling real-estate market. Morgan Stanley, which manages a
total of $43 billion in real-estate assets, has invested just
$2.5 billion of the $4.7 billion of the fund''s committed
capital, the person said. </p>
<p>Final votes on the extension aren''t due until the end of
this month, the person said. Investors in Fund VII include the
Pennsylvania Public School Employees'' Retirement System, China
Investment Corp. and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. </p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reported the discussions about cuts
to fees and the fund''s size earlier today. Matt Burkhard, a
Morgan Stanley spokesman, declined to comment. </p>
<p>German Buildings </p>
<p>MSREF VII has made investments including a portfolio of
retail buildings in Germany and a 150 million euro ($195
million) mezzanine loan for a European luxury hotel owner
controlled by a Blackstone Group LP fund. It also has purchased
a shopping mall in St. Petersburg, Russia, and a set of
distressed real-estate loans in Australia. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley recorded about $4.4 billion in real-estate
losses in 2008 and 2009, including losses from its investment in
the MSREF funds. The firm told investors last year that it
expects to lose $5.4 billion of its $8.8 billion MSREF VI
International fund from 2007, a person familiar with the
situation said at the time. </p>
<p>Last year the firm named John Klopp and Olivier de Poulpiquet co-chief executive officers of its real-estate
investing business to stabilize the unit after billions of
dollars of losses in its funds. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s real-estate investing business had $43
billion of assets under management as of June 30, with 37
percent in Asia, 36 percent in the Americas and 27 percent in
Europe. MSREF VII invests in property in the U.S. and
internationally. Morgan Stanley''s own investment in the fund
amounted to less than 10 percent of its total capital. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world''s largest
soft-drink maker, agreed to acquire about half of the equity in
the beverage business of Saudi Arabia-based Aujan Industries in
what the companies described as a $980 million transaction. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola will purchase 50 percent of the Aujan entity that
holds the rights to the Rani and Barbican brands and 49 percent
of Aujan''s bottling and distribution unit, the companies said
today in a statement. The deal, which excludes Aujan''s Iranian
manufacturing and distribution business, is expected to close in
the first half of 2012, the companies said. </p>
<p>The Middle East is a high-growth region with some of the
highest rates of non-alcoholic ready-to-drink per-capita
consumption, Ahmet C. Bozer, Coca-Cola''s group president for
Eurasia and Africa, said in the statement. This transaction
creates a platform for further cooperation between Coca-Cola
Co., Aujan and existing bottling partners across the region. </p>
<p>The deal will give Atlanta-based Coca-Cola a stake in one
of the Middle East''s leading soft-drink businesses and provide
closely held Aujan with a platform to accelerate the
international growth of brands including Rani and Barbican, the
companies said. Royal Bank of Scotland Plc (RBS) advised Aujan on the
transaction, the beverage company said in a separate statement. </p>
<p>Aujan, established in 1905 as a commodities trading firm,
is one of the 100 biggest companies in Saudi Arabia, employing
more than 2,500 people. Revenue will exceed $850 million this
year, more than double the figure reached in 2007, Aujan said.
The company also holds the license for Nichols Plc-owned Vimto
in the Middle East via its bottling and distribution unit. </p>

East, and Kent Landers, a spokesman for Coca-Cola in the U.S.,

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the biggest computer services provider, settled a
European Union antitrust probe into conduct that may have
hindered rival mainframe-software makers. </p>
<p>The European Commission accepted IBM''s offer to supply
spare parts and technical information to other manufacturers on
reasonable and non-discriminatory terms for five years, the EU
said in an e-mailed statement today. </p>
<p>I am pleased that we could find a swift solution with IBM
to our competition concerns, said EU Competition Commissioner
Joaquin Almunia in the statement. Timely interventions are
crucial in fast-moving technology markets. </p>
<p>While IBM has shifted its focus away from hardware toward
its more profitable software and services businesses, the
mainframe operations have high gross margins and help pull in
revenue for other IBM divisions. Armonk, New York-based IBM
began developing mainframe computers in the 1940s and 1950s and
is among the few companies selling the systems. </p>
<p>IBM''s offer ends a probe that started last year into what
the EU said were unreasonable supply conditions that may
have restricted or delayed rivals'' access to spare parts. IBM
made the proposal in September. The Brussels-based regulator
also closed a separate probe over IBM''s mainframe computers
after three competitors dropped complaints. </p>
<p>IBM welcomes this final resolution of the inquiry into
certain IBM mainframe maintenance practices and is pleased that
the commission''s investigation of the IBM mainframe is now
concluded, Joe Hanley, a spokesman for the company in London,
said in an e-mail. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world''s largest computer-services company, won a
contract to build a food-monitoring system in China as the
nation toughens supervision of food safety after scandals. </p>
<p>The system for Shandong Commercial Group Co. will ensure
the safety of pork products in the coastal province, Harriet Ip,
a spokeswoman in Singapore for Armonk, New York-based IBM, said
in an e-mail today. Financial terms weren''t disclosed for the
project, scheduled for completion in 2013. </p>
<p>The government in China, the world''s largest pork consumer,
said this month it will revise laws to improve food safety after
one person was sentenced to death and 77 others handed jail
terms over meat harmed by an illegal additive. China has
reported other food safety problems this year including toxic
fish, tainted bean sprouts and Sichuan peppercorns dyed with a
coloring agent. </p>
<p>Food supply-chain management technology and services is a
big market, IBM''s Ip said in the e-mail. Demand for food
safety products in China is expected to increase 15 percent per
annum through 2013, when the market will reach 13 billion yuan
($2 billion), she said. </p>
<p>IBM said its project is part of a 195 million yuan cold-
supply chain that Shandong province is building in line with
China''s efforts to improve food safety. The contract forms a
very small portion of the project, which will have full
monitoring and tracing capabilities, from farms to warehouses
and retailers, Ip said. </p>
<p>System Tested </p>
<p>Shandong Commercial has already tested IBM''s food-
monitoring system at 6 slaughter houses, 6 warehouses and about
100 hypermarkets or supermarkets across the province, Ip said. </p>
<p>Pork consumption in China may gain almost 10 percent from
last year to 57 million metric tons in 2015, Wang Yinji, deputy
general manager at COFCO Ltd., the country''s largest grain
trader, said last month. </p>
<p>State-owned Shandong Commercial''s main business interest is
in retail, according to its website. The company also has
operations in the pharmacy and real estate industries and
employs more than 130,000 people, it said. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) Capital Services LLC
withdrew from lawsuits in New York state court challenging MBIA

bond insurer. </p>
<p>Today''s move followed Morgan Stanley''s settling litigation
with MBIA on Dec. 13 over credit-default swaps that led to
billions of dollars of losses. The bank agreed to terminate the
swap contracts and drop its challenge to the insurer''s
restructuring. </p>
<p>HSBC Bank USA NA agreed on Dec. 14 to withdraw from two

the MBIA restructuring, becoming the fifth plaintiff to drop out
of the litigation since August. </p>
<p>Banks including UBS AG and Bank of America Corp. remain
plaintiffs in the suits, according to court filings. The banks
claimed in their suits that the restructuring of Armonk, New
York-based MBIA might leave the insurer unable to pay claims. </p>
<p>More banks or other companies disputing MBIA''s
restructuring may drop their lawsuits by the end of the year,
Jay Brown, the bond insurer''s chief executive officer, said last

<p>Coca-Cola Femsa SAB (KOF), Latin America''s
largest Coke bottler, sees as much as 2.7 billion pesos ($193.8
million) in cash flow from three acquisitions announced this
year, Chief Financial Officer Hector Trevino said. </p>
<p>The sum of the three Mexican companies will represent
about 2.5 billion to 2.7 billion pesos in Ebitda in addition to
what Coca-Cola Femsa used to generate before these mergers,
Trevino said in a telephone interview today from Queretaro,
Mexico. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization is a measure of cash flow known as Ebitda. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Femsa bought the beverage division of Mexico''s
Grupo Fomento Queretano for 6.6 billion pesos ($474 million) and
will pay for the acquisition by issuing new shares, according to
a statement to regulators today. Earlier this week, Coca-Cola
Femsa said its shareholders approved an agreement to buy the
bottling operations of Mexico''s Grupo Cimsa with new shares, a
transaction announced in September. </p>
<p>In June, Coca-Cola Femsa agreed to pay 6.55 billion pesos
in stock for the Coke bottling operations of Grupo Tampico SA,
marking the company''s first all-share transaction. </p>
<p>The Queretano purchase should be completed by the first
quarter of next year, Trevino said. </p>
<p>Trevino said he''s open to seeking out additional mergers or

<p>Coca-Cola Femsa reported a 7.1 percent increase in third-

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) sold $1.25
billion of 30-year bonds as yields on the longest-maturity
investment-grade company debt are at about record lows. </p>
<p>The biggest U.S. bank by assets issued 5.4 percent
debentures that yield 250 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
JPMorgan has raised $4.25 billion by selling 30-year notes, the
most among its peers since issuance of the securities by banks
resumed in October 2010 after a 15-month pause, Bloomberg data
show. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the most creditworthy of the six biggest U.S.
lenders in the eyes of derivatives traders, is taking advantage
of yields on investment-grade bonds due in 15 years that average
5.19 percent, after falling from 6.16 percent in February,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. Banks
have sold $323.9 billion of debt in the U.S. this year, with 97
percent coming due within 10 years, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Yields on the long-maturity debt reached a record low of
5.02 percent on Nov. 1. </p>
<p>In its last offering of 30-year bonds, New York-based
JPMorgan sold $1.75 billion of 5.6 percent debt that paid 140
basis points, or 1.4 percentage points, more than similar-
maturity Treasuries on July 14. The bank issued $1.25 billion of
5.5 percent, 30-year bonds at a 165 basis-point spread on Oct.
14, 2010. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps on JPMorgan, which investors use to
hedge against losses on the company''s debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, fell to 149 basis points yesterday from 182
basis points on Nov. 25, according to data provider CMA. That
means investors pay $149,000 a year to protect $10 million of
the bank''s debt for five years. </p>
<p>Credit Swap Prices </p>
<p>Contracts on San Francisco-based Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) were at
150 while those for Bank of America Corp. (BAC) reached 407. Swaps on
Citigroup Inc. (C) were 276, contracts protecting the debt of
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) traded at 322 and those on Morgan
Stanley (MS) were at 426, according to CMA, which is owned by CME
Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market. </p>
<p>Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt.
The contracts, which investors use to hedge against losses on
corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness, decline as
investor confidence improves and rise as it deteriorates. </p>

<p>General Maritime Corp. (GMR), the second-
largest U.S. owner of oil tankers, won approval of financing
agreements with Oaktree Capital Management LP after changing
terms to address creditors'' objections. </p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn in Manhattan today
approved a $75 million loan from lenders including Nordea Bank
Finland Plc and a $175 million equity investment from Oaktree.
Glenn questioned expense reimbursements and a breakup fee for
Oaktree, a junior secured lender to General Maritime that will
be the lead, or stalking-horse, bidder at an auction to sell the
company. </p>
<p>This has all the hallmarks of a loan-to-own structure,
Glenn said. Even if the committee is satisfied, I''m not
necessarily satisfied. </p>
<p>General Maritime negotiated the loan and Oaktree''s
investment before filing for bankruptcy last month. Kenneth Eckstein, a lawyer for General Maritime, told Glenn today that
under an agreement with creditors, some loan terms were changed
and the New York-based company now has until Jan. 18 instead of
Jan. 4 to file a reorganization plan. </p>
<p>The official creditors'' committee will get $125,000 to
investigate actions before the bankruptcy, more than the $75,000
previously allotted, and will hire Lowenstein Sandler PC to
handle the probe. </p>
<p>Auction Planned </p>
<p>General Maritime still plans to auction itself to the
highest bidder and still has a baseline bid from Oaktree,
Eckstein said. The breakup fee for Oaktree if a higher bidder
wins was reduced to $7.75 million from $12.5 million. </p>
<p>Some issues connected with the loan still need to be worked
out, such as a provision that gives Oaktree all the equity in
the reorganized company, Eckstein told Glenn. General Maritime
on Nov. 18 won court permission to draw $30 million of the loan. </p>
<p>We''re still resolving a dispute over equity, and how
unsecured creditors will be treated, Eckstein said. </p>
<p>The creditors'' committee initially argued against the loan,
saying it would give Oaktree all the equity in a reorganized
company while blocking creditors from suing the Los-Angeles
based investment manager over transactions it made with General
Maritime before the bankruptcy filing. </p>
<p>Supporting Lenders </p>
<p>Under the restructuring support agreement reached before
the bankruptcy filing, all of General Maritime''s debt would be
converted into stock in a newly created company, and lenders
would agree to vote in favor of a reorganization plan under
certain terms. Supporting lenders include parties involved in a
$550 million loan made in May of this year and a $372 million
loan made in May 2010, according to court papers. </p>
<p>General Maritime''s $300 million in 12 percent notes due in
2017 traded at less than 2 cents on the dollar today, a 66
percent decline from 6 cents on Dec. 8, according to Trace, the
bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. The notes traded at about 10 cents when the company
filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 17. </p>
<p>General Maritime, which operates in more than 230 ports of
call in over 70 countries, filed for bankruptcy in November. It
listed assets of $1.71 billion and debt of $1.41 billion in a
Chapter 11 petition. </p>
<p>The case is In re General Maritime Corp., 11-15285, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), the financial firm
whose shares have declined 45 percent this year, plans to cut
about 1,600 jobs amid an industrywide drop in revenue from
investment banking and trading. </p>
<p>Reductions will occur in the first quarter of 2012 at all
levels of the firm, Mark Lake, a company spokesman, said in an
interview today. The figure amounts to about 2.6 percent of the
62,648 employees New York-based Morgan Stanley had at the end of
September. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer James Gorman is grappling with
Europe''s debt crisis and concern that U.S. economic growth will
slow, reducing demand for trading and investment-banking
services. Morgan Stanley''s revenue from those businesses dropped
36 percent in the third quarter from the previous three months,
excluding accounting adjustments. </p>
<p>The decision to reduce staff comes as we conduct our
year-end performance-management process and evaluate the right
size of the franchise for 2012, Lake said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, the sixth-biggest U.S. bank by assets and
owner of the world''s largest brokerage, advanced 0.7 percent to
$15.17 at 11:25 a.m. in New York trading. </p>
<p>Financial firms have disclosed plans to eliminate more than
200,000 jobs globally this year in response to market turmoil,
economic weakness and fallout from Europe''s sovereign debt
crisis. Citigroup Inc., the third-biggest U.S. bank, told
regulators this week it may dismiss 413 employees in New York
City as the firm starts eliminating 4,500 jobs. </p>
<p>Smith Barney </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s job reductions won''t affect financial
advisers in the firm''s joint venture with New York-based
Citigroup''s Smith Barney, according to a person familiar with
the plans. Morgan Stanley previously said it would eliminate at
least 300 low-producing brokers, and the number of advisers fell
by 828 in the 12 months ended Sept. 30. </p>
<p>The cuts in fixed-income trading will come primarily from
businesses such as securitization that the firm is looking to
shrink as it faces new capital rules, said the person, who
declined to be named because the details haven''t been made
public. The firm won''t eliminate a significant number of jobs in
the interest-rate and foreign-exchange trading businesses that
it expanded in 2009 and 2010, the person said. </p>
<p>Equities trading will likely be less affected by the cuts
than other areas, the person said. Revenue from that business,
excluding accounting adjustments, jumped 29 percent in the first
nine months of this year, the most of any major U.S. firm. </p>
<p>Return on Equity </p>
<p>Gorman said in October that he wasn''t wedded to the current
size of the company and would make necessary cuts if the
slowdown in the capital markets was prolonged. Morgan Stanley
had a 6 percent return on average common equity in the first
nine months of the year, below Gorman''s goal of mid-teens. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley said in a June presentation it had begun a
three-year cost-saving project that sought to eliminate $1
billion from annual expenses. The firm increased that target to
$1.4 billion in October. </p>
<p>Revenue from investment banking and trading at the 10
largest global firms fell 12 percent in the first nine months of
this year, after a 23 percent decline in 2010, according to
industry consultant Coalition Ltd. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest

position running the retail unit''s digital, online and mobile
strategy. </p>
<p>Customers'' use of Internet and mobile banking has
skyrocketed, Todd Maclin, the chief executive officer of
JPMorgan''s retail unit, said in an internal memo to employees
today. In fact, three quarters of our customers actively use
chase.com and active mobile households have more than doubled
since the first quarter of 2010. </p>
<p>Cleary, who previously ran small-business lending, will
handle the retail bank''s Internet and mobile teams, according to
the memo. He will work with Paul Heller, head of the corporate
Internet group; Jack Stephenson, who runs mobile e-commerce; and
Guy Chiarello, who supervises technology across the company.
Maclin cited Cleary''s expansion of business banking in growth
markets such as California, Florida and Texas. </p>
<p>Scott Geller, chief risk officer for New York-based
JPMorgan''s commercial bank, will replace Cleary in overseeing
lending to companies with less than $20 million in annual
revenue. A successor for Geller is being sought, Maclin wrote.
The retail bank lends money to businesses with less than $20
million in annual revenue while the commercial bank lends money
to middle-market companies with revenue of $20 million to about
$2 billion. </p>
<p>Patrick Linehan, a spokesman for JPMorgan, confirmed the
contents of the memo. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s largest
drugmaker, has settled almost half of the lawsuits over its
menopause drugs and increased the funds set aside to resolve the
cases, the company said in a regulatory filing. </p>
<p>Pfizer and its Wyeth and Pharmacia  Upjohn units have
resolved about 46 percent of suits that claimed the companies''
hormone-replacement medicines, including Prempro and Premarin,
caused breast cancer, according to the Securities and Exchange
Commission filing. Pfizer said it added $68 million to the
$772 million it already reserved for the cases. </p>
<p>We have recorded a charge of $260 million in the first
nine months of 2011 that provides for the minimum expected costs
to resolve all the remaining hormone-replacement actions,
Pfizer officials said in the Nov. 10 filing. </p>
<p>More than 6 million women took Prempro and related
menopause drugs to treat symptoms including hot flashes and mood
swings before a 2002 study highlighted their links to cancer.
Wyeth''s sales of the medicines, which are still on the market,
exceeded $2 billion before the release of the Women''s Health
Initiative study sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. </p>
<p>Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Wyeth''s
Premarin, an estrogen-based drug, with progestin-laden Provera,
made by Pfizer''s Upjohn unit, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth
combined the two hormones in its Prempro pill. Pfizer, based in
New York, acquired Wyeth in 2009. </p>
<p>10,000 Claims </p>
<p>At the height of the litigation, Pfizer faced more than
10,000 claims that its menopause drugs caused breast cancer,
according to lawyers for former users. Those lawsuits included
more than 8,000 cases consolidated in federal court in Arkansas
and suits in state courts in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Minnesota. </p>
<p>Pfizer in May disclosed the $772 million reserve and said
it had resolved a third of the cases, or about 3,300. The
November filing indicates Pfizer officials have now settled
almost 5,000 of the suits. </p>
<p>Pfizer continues to have a strong record of success in
defending these cases, Chris Loder, a company spokesman, said
in an e-mailed statement. While we will continue to look for
opportunities to enter into favorable settlements where
appropriate, we will also continue to vigorously defend these
medicines in litigation. </p>
<p>Jury Verdicts </p>
<p>Wyeth and Upjohn have now lost 10 of the 18 Prempro cases
decided by juries since 2006. Pfizer got some of those verdicts
thrown out or had the awards reduced. It resolved some of the
verdicts through settlements, while other decisions are on
appeal. Pfizer also has had cases thrown out before trial. </p>
<p>Earlier this month, a Philadelphia jury ordered the Pfizer
units to pay $72.6 million in compensatory damages to three
women who blamed the drugs for their breast cancers. Pfizer
agreed to settle the case before jurors were asked to decide
whether the company should face punitive damages. Terms of the
settlements weren''t released. </p>
<p>The $260 million Pfizer has reserved for the remaining
Prempro cases is only an estimate and additional charges
may be required, the company said in the Nov. 10 filing. </p>
<p>Zoe Littlepage, a lawyer representing women suing Pfizer
over the menopause drugs, said that reserve doesn''t provide
enough compensation to spur settlements of outstanding claims. </p>
<p>Based upon the size of the jury verdicts to date, and the
fact that multiple appellate courts have now affirmed some of
those verdicts, this new amount of money set aside by Pfizer
seems grossly insufficient to resolve the remaining claims,
Littlepage said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>The consolidated case in Arkansas is In Re Prempro
Products, 03-CV-015070-WRW, U.S. District Court, Eastern
District of Arkansas (Little Rock). </p>

Australia since mid-2009 as the company advances with the A$29
billion ($29 billion) Wheatstone project. </p>
<p>Chevron''s Vos-1 well found 453 feet (138 meters) of gas in

ConocoPhillips and Inpex Corp. are among energy companies
planning about A$200 billion of LNG projects in Australia. </p>
<p>Chevron decided earlier this year to go forward with
Wheatstone, targeting first LNG shipments to Asia in 2016. The
U.S. energy producer has called Gorgon and Wheatstone the
centerpieces of its global expansion plans. </p>

<p>A Brazilian lawsuit that seeks to
halt Transocean Ltd. (RIG) and Chevron Corp. (CVX) operations after an oil
spill would reduce the country''s offshore drilling at a time
when it wants to double output in ten years. </p>
<p>Federal prosecutors in Campos, in the oil region of Rio de
Janeiro state, are suing both companies for 20 billion reais
($10.6 billion) in environmental and social damages and asked a
court to suspend their operations, according to a statement
yesterday. Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, and 
Transocean, based in Vernier, Switzerland, said they haven''t 
been notified and are cooperating with authorities. </p>
<p>The case imperils Brazil''s plan to boost crude output
because Transocean operates 10 out of the 61 rigs working in the
country and it would be hard to replace them in a tight market
for oil equipment, said Judson Bailey, an analyst at Jefferies 
Co Inc. Brazilian oil production growth has slowed after the
country increased safety requirements following the spill at BP
Plc''s Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico last year. </p>
<p>The rig market is pretty tight, so if Transocean were
banned, the oil companies wouldn''t be happy at all, Bailey
said in a phone interview from Houston. Chevron and Petrobras
can''t get a rig elsewhere, so it messes with the state-owned oil
company. </p>
<p>Chevron, Brazil''s third-largest producer behind state-
controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc,
will see production wane in Brazil until the government lets it
drill again, said Cleveland Jones, an oil specialist and
professor at Rio de Janeiro State University. </p>
<p>Opening Shot'' </p>
<p>Chevron fell 3 percent to $100.53 at the close in New York
yesterday. Transocean declined 3.9 percent to $40.19. </p>
<p>Chevron has come under increased scrutiny in Brazil after
3,000 barrels of oil leaked last month from an oil field in deep
waters of the Campos Basin. The company underestimated the
amount of pressure at an oil deposit it was exploring, and crude
leaked from the reservoir for about eight days, George Buck, the
head of Chevron for Brazil, said on Nov. 20. </p>
<p>BP has booked more than $40 billion in losses related to the
April 2010 blowout of the Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico.
The accident killed 11 workers aboard Transocean''s Deepwater
Horizon well and spilled 4.9 million barrels of crude. That''s
about $8,163 per barrel spilled, compared to $3.57 million per
barrel if the Brazilian fine were to hold. </p>
<p>Still Operating </p>
<p>Ultimately this is an opening shot, Chevron''s attorneys
are probably not at all fazed by this, said Jones. The
prosecutor''s office will be a positive development for Chevron,
because they will ensure that the letter of the law is followed
and the letter of the law is reasonable. </p>
<p>Chevron said in an e-mailed statement that it responded
responsibly to the incident at its Frade Field and has dealt
transparently with all Brazilian authorities. Guy Cantwell, a
Transocean spokesman, said the company''s rigs are operating in
Brazilian waters and the company continues to cooperate with the
government. </p>
<p>Chevron holds a 51.74 percent stake in Frade. Petrobras
holds a 30 percent stake, and Frade Japao Petroleo Ltda., a
joint venture including Inpex Corp. and Sojitz Corp, holds 18.26
percent. Frade is about 230 miles (370 kilometers) northeast of
Rio de Janeiro in the Campos Basin and produced 76,000 barrels a
day of oil and natural gas in October. </p>
<p>Criminal Lawsuit </p>
<p>In the next few weeks, prosecutors will probably file a
criminal lawsuit against Chevron for alleged environmental crime,
said Romulo Sampaio, a law professor at Brazil''s Getulio Vargas
Foundation. </p>
<p>In this case, everything conspires against the company:
it''s a foreign company, drilling for oil in Brazilian waters.
That may bring about emotional responses, Sampaio, who
coordinates the university''s Environmental Law program, said in
a telephone interview. </p>
<p>Prosecutors'' track record in lawsuits against companies
involving environmental issues has been at best mixed. Federal
prosecutors twice this year sought to halt construction of the
Belo Monte hydroelectric dam in the Amazon, and on both
occasions federal judges ruled that the project should proceed. </p>
<p>Federal prosecutors in 2009 convinced Brazilian cattle
ranchers in Para, the state that has lost the most forestland to
illegal logging, to halt Amazon forest destruction and replant
trees to avoid an international ban on meat after prosecutors
took action. </p>
<p>Brazil''s five largest meatpackers -- JBS SA, the world''s
largest beef producer, Marfrig Alimentos SA, Bertin SA, Minerva
SA and Frigol Comercial Ltda. -- agreed to stop buying cattle
from suppliers that contributed to stripping the Amazon forest. </p>
<p>A lawsuit against Alcoa Inc. is still pending after six
years of legal haggling. Federal and state prosecutors sued
Alcoa''s Brazilian mining subsidiary in 2005 in an effort to
block construction of the Juruti bauxite mine in the state of
Para, saying the company had circumvented the law by not
applying for a federal permit and instead seeking a license from
the state of Para. </p>

<p>A bondholder group said it may seek
reimbursements from JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) for soured home-loan
securities, after Bank of America Corp. agreed to pay $8.5
billion to resolve similar claims this year. </p>
<p>Investors holding $95 billion of mortgage bonds instructed
the trustees for the debt to investigate whether JPMorgan
included ineligible loans in the securities, according to a
statement released today by Gibbs  Bruns LLP, which says it
represents the group. The law firm helped secure the settlement
with Bank of America in June. </p>
<p>Our clients continue to seek a comprehensive solution to
the problems of ineligible mortgages, Kathy Patrick, a partner
at Gibbs  Bruns, said in the statement. Today''s action is
another step toward achieving that goal. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, based in New York, is a defendant in more than
10,000 legal proceedings, the company said in its third-quarter
report. Demands from private investors over mortgage bonds have
been limited, the bank said. </p>
<p>Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for JPMorgan, declined to
comment. </p>
<p>The bondholders asked Bank of New York Mellon Corp., U.S.
Bank NA, Wells Fargo  Co., Citigroup Inc. and HSBC Holdings Plc
to open investigations into the pools debt issued by affiliates
of JPMorgan, today''s statement said. </p>
<p>Bank of America''s proposed $8.5 billion settlement would
resolve claims from investors in Countrywide Financial Corp.
mortgage bonds. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America
acquired Countrywide in 2008. </p>
<p>The settlement has drawn criticism from insurer American
International Group Inc. (AIG) and other investors. New York Attorney
General Eric Schneiderman and Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden have also intervened in the case, which is pending in
federal court. The bondholder group has defended the settlement
saying in a court filing that rejection of the deal would be
devastating for investors. </p>

unless Europe''s situation deteriorates or inflation falls too
quickly. </p>
<p>So far, the European crisis has had a limited impact on
the U.S., he said in an interview today with Bloomberg

concerned as anyone. </p>
<p>For Europe, I think we are just getting started in terms
of the slowdown, Feroli said. Whether we see more QE, or

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), deemed by
derivatives traders to be the most creditworthy of the six
biggest U.S. banks, locked in the lowest interest rate its
industry has seen since 2005 on 30-year debt. </p>
<p>The biggest U.S. bank by assets sold $1.25 billion of 5.4
percent debentures yesterday to yield 250 basis points, or 2.5
percentage points, more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., the only other U.S.-based bank to have issued 30-year debt
in 2011, sold $2.5 billion of 6.25 percent bonds at a 170 basis-
point spread on Jan. 21. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is pushing out the maturities of its debt as
yields on investment-grade corporate bonds due in 15 years or
more approach the lowest on record while the Federal Reserve
holds down interest rates to stimulate the economy. The New
York-based bank has raised $4.25 billion by selling 30-year debt
since issuance of the securities by banks resumed in October
2010 after a 15-month pause, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is one of the few in the market now that can
issue these bonds, and a big reason is investors think they''re
one of the best banks out there, Rob Crimmins, a New York-
based money manager at RS Investment Management Co., which
oversees $30 billion. In this environment, there aren''t many
banks that would be able to sell 30-year bonds. </p>
<p>Justin Perras, a spokesman for JPMorgan, declined to
comment on the sale. </p>
<p>Lowest Coupon </p>
<p>JPMorgan wasn''t among nine large banks including Bank of
America Corp. (BAC), Barclays Plc and Deutsche Bank AG downgraded
yesterday by Fitch Ratings, which found they are particularly
sensitive to the increased challenges the financial markets
face, according to a statement. </p>
<p>The debt sold yesterday has the lowest coupon among 30-year
U.S. bank bonds since San Francisco-based Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC)
issued $750 million of 5.375 percent debt at an 80 basis-point
spread in January 2005, Bloomberg data show. The securities
climbed 1.36 cents to 101.2 cents on the dollar to pay a 245
basis-point spread as of 10:53 a.m. in New York, according to
Trace, the bond price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. </p>
<p>In its previous offering of 30-year bonds, JPMorgan sold
$1.75 billion of 5.6 percent debt that paid 140 basis points, or
1.4 percentage points, more than similar-maturity Treasuries on
July 14. The bank issued $1.25 billion of 5.5 percent, 30-year
bonds at a 165 basis-point spread on Oct. 14, 2010, the first
sale since Citigroup Inc. (C) issued $2.5 billion of the debt in
July 2009, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Average Maturity </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s offerings extended the average maturity of its
outstanding bonds to 6.5 years at the end of the third quarter
from 5.66 years in the first quarter of 2010, Bloomberg data
show. The bank''s average coupon fell to 5.01 percent from 5.19
percent. It has sold the most 30-year debt among its peers since
October 2010. </p>
<p>HSBC Holdings Plc based in London and Utrecht, Netherlands-
based Rabobank Nederland NV also issued debentures of that
maturity this year. </p>
<p>Banks have sold $323.9 billion of debt in the U.S. this
year, with more than 97 percent coming due within 10 years,
Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>The extra yield investors demand to own U.S. bank bonds
instead of Treasuries has risen to 395 basis points from 210
basis points since the end of 2010, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data. Spreads touched 403 on Nov. 29, the
widest since July 2009. </p>
<p>Yields on investment-grade bonds due in 15 years or more
averaged 5.21 percent yesterday, after falling from 6.16 percent
in February, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index
data. They touched 5.02 percent, the lowest in daily data
extending to October 1986, on Nov. 1. </p>
<p>Good Value'' </p>
<p>Spreads have widened on financial company bonds as concern
among investors mounted that Europe''s sovereign debt crisis
would spread, imperiling the global economy. That has made
JPMorgan and other U.S. banks more attractive to fixed-income
investors, said Anthony Valeri, a market strategist at LPL
Financial, which manages $330 billion. </p>
<p>Financials in general and certainly the stronger ones are
good value in this market, Valeri said in a telephone
interview from San Diego. We don''t think the bank sector''s
going to implode. We think exposure to Europe is manageable for
U.S. banks, and therefore this risk premium is significantly
large right now to where it offers an opportunity. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps on JPMorgan, which investors use to
hedge against losses on the company''s debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, fell to 145.9 basis points yesterday from 182
basis points on Nov. 25, according to data provider CMA. That
means investors pay $145,900 a year to protect $10 million of
the bank''s debt for five years. </p>
<p>Other Bank Swaps </p>
<p>Contracts on Wells Fargo were at 146.2 while those for Bank
of America reached 402.5. Swaps on Citigroup were 274.7,
contracts protecting the debt of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) traded
at 313.4 and those on Morgan Stanley (MS) were at 416.6, according to
CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted
by dealers in the privately negotiated market. </p>
<p>Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt.
The contracts, which investors use to hedge against losses on
corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness, decline as
investor confidence improves and rise as it deteriorates. </p>
<p>Moody''s Investors Service assigns JPMorgan a rating of Aa3,
its highest grade on any of the six biggest U.S. banks. Fitch
holds a rank of AA- on it and Wells Fargo. Standard  Poor''s
ranks Wells Fargo A+ and JPMorgan A. </p>
<p>Trust Management'' </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s ratio of tangible common equity to tangible
assets, a measure of its ability to absorb losses, is the lowest
among the six biggest U.S. banks at 5.49, Bloomberg data show.
Jim Leonard, a Chicago-based credit analyst at Morningstar Inc.,
cited the ratio when downgrading the lender to A from A+,
calling the level a cause for some concern in a note
yesterday. </p>
<p>Investors buying JPMorgan''s bonds are looking past any
financial weaknesses and giving it credit for Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon''s performance in the wake of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.''s 2008 bankruptcy, when the firm avoided losses,
Leonard said. </p>
<p>Their credit metrics are OK, but not stellar, Leonard
said in a telephone interview. What is stellar is their
reputation and their performance during the credit crisis. When
you think about the credit quality of banks, at some point you
have to trust management knows what it''s doing. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world''s largest
software maker, told a German court that Android-based
smartphones and tablets from Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. (MMI)
infringe its European patents. </p>
<p>Microsoft claimed in the first of three cases heard
yesterday that software Motorola Mobility uses protected
technology that helps computers switch between languages in the
same program. Presiding Judge Peter Guntz in Munich said the
patent may have been drafted so narrowly that its language may
not cover the solution Motorola Mobility uses. </p>
<p>It was the first time the two U.S. companies faced each
other in a German court in the patent dispute. The country has
become a center for European smartphone and tablet lawsuits with
Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Samsung Electronics Co. are involved in similar
cases in Mannheim and Munich. </p>
<p>A suit between Microsoft and Motorola Mobility in the U.S.
is pending before the International Trade Commission in
Washington where a judge is scheduled to release his findings
tomorrow. Microsoft sued Motorola Mobility in Munich, while
Motorola Mobility, which is being acquired by Google Inc., filed
several suits against Microsoft in Mannheim. </p>
<p>An offer by the court to mediate settlement talks was
rebuffed by both parties yesterday. While the companies have
talked, not much progress has been made since their last meeting
in October, Motorola Mobility attorney Marcus Grosch said. </p>
<p>The German cases are just a fraction of all the
litigation. The bulk of suits is pending in the U.S., said
Peter Hess, a lawyer for Microsoft. Motorola Mobility cannot
settle as long as Google hasn''t gained control, so talks here
don''t make much sense. </p>
<p>Google said Aug. 15 it would buy Libertyville, Illinois-based Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion to obtain patents that
may be used to fend off suits targeting handsets and tablet
computers that use Android. </p>
<p>Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, makes its own
mobile-operating system, Windows Phone 7, which competes with
Android. </p>
<p>In a second hearing yesterday, Microsoft argued that
Android-based devices illicitly use its technology for sending
short messages with an unlimited number of characters. Motorola
Mobility, which denies wrongdoing, argues Android''s uses a two-step procedure, whereas Microsoft''s patent protects a one-step
solution. The third case concerned technology used for intents
notifications. </p>
<p>The court scheduled separate hearings for each case in
March and April. </p>
<p>Yesterday''s cases are: LG Muenchen, 7 O 7019333/11,
7019334/11 and 70020429/11. </p>
<h2>Cephalon, Acusphere Claim Celgene''s Abraxane Infringes Patent </h2>
<p>Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA)''s Cephalon unit and
Acusphere Inc. (ACUS) sued Celgene Corp. (CELG) for patent infringement
related to the breast cancer drug Abraxane. </p>
<p>The lawsuit claims Celgene''s Abraxane violates an Acusphere
patent for a drug formulation of paclitaxel particles, according
to the complaint filed Dec. 14 in federal court in Boston.
Abraxane''s active ingredient is the compound paclitaxel. </p>
<p>The injected drug, used to treat metastatic breast cancer,
was obtained by Summit, New Jersey-based Celgene as part of its
purchase of Abraxis BioScience Inc. in 2010. The drug generated
$282 million in sales in the first nine months of this year,
according to the company''s quarterly reports. </p>
<p>Cephalon, acquired in October by Petah Tikva, Israel-based
Teva, is the exclusive licensee of Watertown, Massachusetts-based Acusphere''s patent. The companies are seeking cash
compensation and an order to block further use of the invention. </p>
<p>The case is Cephalon Inc. v. Celgene Corp., 11cv12226, U.S.
District Court for the District of Massachusetts (Boston). </p>
<h2>DuPont, Honeywell Said to Face EU Car-Refrigerant Probe </h2>
<p>DuPont Co. (DD), the largest U.S. chemicals company by market
value, and Honeywell International Inc. (HON) face a European Union
antitrust probe over a refrigerant for car air-conditioning
systems, according to four people familiar with the plan. </p>
<p>The European Commission will soon open a formal
investigation to examine whether DuPont and Honeywell may have
concealed their ownership of patents for the refrigerant before
the car industry agreed to use the technology as a standard,
said the people who couldn''t be identified because the issue
isn''t yet public. </p>
<p>Honeywell and DuPont are expecting growth from the
technology they jointly developed to meet EU environmental rules
to cut greenhouse gases from air-conditioning systems. DuPont
told investors this week that the low-emission refrigerant
promises nice growth and some healthy margins. Honeywell''s
specialty chemicals division has said it expects coolants to
help it make extremely solid profits. </p>
<p>EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said earlier
this month he planned to open a high-profile case on
standards to follow an investigation into standards in the
banking industry </p>
<p>DuPont will continue to cooperate fully with this inquiry
and is confident that the commission will conclude that actions
taken by DuPont complied with applicable laws, said Janet
Smith, a spokeswoman for the Wilmington, Delaware-based company. </p>
<p>Honeywell is confident that its practices are consistent
with the law and that the commission will conclude that we acted
in full compliance with European Union competition rules,
Peter Dalpe, a spokesman for the Morristown, New Jersey-based
company said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>The refrigerant developed by Honeywell and DuPont was
designed to replace ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons, which
can''t be included in new cars sold in the 27-nation EU from
2017. </p>
<p>Honeywell and DuPont agreed last year on a joint venture to
produce the refrigerant from the fourth quarter this year. </p>
<p>The Brussels-based antitrust authority can fine companies
as much as 10 percent of yearly sales or require them to change
the way they do business if it concludes that they harmed
competition. </p>

<h2>Yahoo May Win Case Over U.K. Soccer Data, EU Court Aide Says </h2>
<p>Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) may win a bid to access annual schedules of the
English and Scottish soccer leagues, an adviser at the European
Union''s highest court said. </p>
<p>Soccer leagues can''t claim copyright protection for match
schedules, Paolo Mengozzi of the EU Court of Justice said in a
non-binding opinion yesterday. The creation of soccer fixture
lists is a data creation activity and not an original
intellectual creation. The Luxembourg-based EU court follows
this advice in a majority of cases. </p>
<p>The effort expended in the creation of the data cannot be
taken into consideration for the purposes of assessing the
eligibility for protection of the database as such, Mengozzi
said in his opinion. </p>
<p>Yahoo, based in Sunnyvale, California, and a number of
betting companies who want to access the information, are at
loggerheads with the soccer leagues over whether their lists''
data is protected by copyright. While Yahoo''s U.K. unit argued
the data isn''t protected and can be published without payment,
the English and Scottish leagues said they own the rights to the
data on the annual fixture lists and can charge for its use. </p>
<p>A London court in 2010 ruled the data is protected by
copyright under the EU''s database law. The case is now pending
at the Court of Appeal in London, which last year referred the
case to the EU court for guidance. </p>
<p>Any ruling by the EU Court of Justice, which usually
follows within six months of the opinion, will be binding. </p>
<p>We''re pleased that the Advocate General shares our
opinion that there are no intellectual property rights in
football fixtures, Yahoo said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Football DataCo, which is responsible for the Premier
League and Football League fixture lists, declined to comment. </p>
<p>The case is C-604/10, Football DataCo Limited, Football
Association Premier League Ltd, Football League Limited,
Scottish Premier League Limited, Scottish Football League, PA
Sport UK Limited v. Yahoo UK Limited, Stan James (Abingdon)
Limited, Stan James Plc, Enetpulse APS. </p>
<h2>Red Bull Loses EU Court Ruling Over Dutch Trademark Breach </h2>
<p>Red Bull GmbH, an Austrian energy-drink maker, lost a
challenge at the European Union''s highest court over an alleged
breach of its trademark by a Dutch company. </p>
<p>A service consisting of the mere filling of cans bearing
a sign protected as a trademark is not use of that sign which is
liable to be prohibited, the EU Court of Justice, the region''s
top court, said in a ruling in Luxembourg yesterday. </p>
<p>Red Bull, based in Fuschl am See, Austria, sued Dutch
company Frisdranken Industrie Winters BV after it filled up cans
bearing logos and texts such as Bullfigter, and Red Horn
with drinks for another company, called Smart Drinks. Red Bull,
whose logo is a red bull, argued its Benelux trademark rights
had been infringed. </p>
<p>Frisdranken didn''t use the protected trademark and couldn''t
have infringed it, the court said. </p>
<p>The service provided by Winters consists of the filling
of cans and this service does not have any similarity with the
product for which Red Bull''s trademarks were registered, said
the EU court. </p>
<p>Tina Deutner, a spokeswoman for Red Bull, declined to
comment. </p>
<p>The case is pending at the Dutch Supreme Court, which last
year sought the EU court''s guidance whether a company that fills
up cans provided by another company, can breach trademark
rights. </p>

<h2>Hollywood-Backed Bill on Web Piracy Debated as Amendments Added </h2>
<p>House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith urged U.S.
lawmakers to approve Hollywood-backed legislation aimed at
stopping Internet piracy of movies and goods that Google Inc.
opposes as promoting censorship. </p>
<p>Smith''s panel was debating 60 proposed amendments to the
Stop Online Piracy Act yesterday before deciding whether to send
the measure to the full House for consideration. Lawmakers on
the panel raised concerns that a provision on blocking websites
may damage the security of the Internet''s domain-name system and
requested a delay to hear technical testimony. </p>
<p>Lobbying by the entertainment and Internet industries
intensified ahead of yesterday''s hearing. Movie studios,
including Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc., want a crackdown on
non-U.S. websites that sell illegally copied films and TV shows.
Web companies say the House measure would harm innovation. </p>
<p>Laws equip U.S. authorities and rights-holders to take
action against criminals who operate within our borders,
Smith, a Republican from Texas, said in an opening statement at
the hearing. But there is no parallel authority that permits
effective action against criminals who operate from abroad. </p>
<p>The bill would let the Justice Department ask courts to
order Internet-service providers, search engines, payment
services and advertising networks to block or cease business
with non-U.S. websites trafficking in stolen content or
counterfeit goods. </p>
<p>Sixteen Internet executives, including Google co-founder
Sergey Brin, PayPal Inc. co-founder Elon Musk, and EBay Inc.
founder Pierre Omidyar, published an open letter to Congress in
major newspapers yesterday saying the House and Senate bills
would give the U.S. government power to censor the Web. </p>
<p>Google, Facebook Inc. and other Internet companies rallied
around an alternative draft bill from Senator Ron Wyden, an
Oregon Democrat, and Representative Darrell Issa, a California
Republican, which would make the U.S. International Trade
Commission the arbiter of complaints about non-U.S. websites
linked to piracy. </p>
<p>The proposal from Wyden and Issa fails to provide an
effective way to target foreign rogue websites and goes easy on
online piracy and counterfeiting, Michael O''Leary, senior

<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission appealed a federal judge''s decision to reject its
proposed $285 million settlement with Citigroup Inc. (C) </p>
<p>The appeal, filed yesterday in the U.S. Court of Appeals in
New York, challenged U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff''s rejection
last month of the settlement, which involved claims that
Citigroup misled investors in a $1 billion financial product
linked to risky mortgages. </p>
<p>We believe the district court committed legal error by
announcing a new and unprecedented standard that inadvertently
harms investors by depriving them of substantial, certain and
immediate benefits, SEC Enforcement Director Robert Khuzami
said yesterday in a statement. </p>
<p>Rakoff criticized the agency''s practice of resolving cases
without requiring the subject of the allegations to admit
wrongdoing. In his ruling, Rakoff said the settlement didn''t
provide him with any proven or admitted facts to inform his
judgment. </p>
<p>Khuzami said the judge''s decision is at odds with decades
of court decisions that have upheld similar settlements..
Rakoff''s approach could in practical terms press the SEC to
trial in many more instances, likely resulting in fewer cases
overall and less money being returned to investors, he said in
the statement. </p>
<p>The SEC said a settlement such as the one struck with
Citigroup puts money back in the pockets of harmed investors
without years of courtroom delay and without the twin risks of
losing at trial or winning but recovering less than the
settlement amount -- risks that always exist no matter how
strong the evidence. </p>
<p>Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a Citigroup spokeswoman, said the
New York-based bank disagrees with the court''s rejection of the
settlement. The agreement fully complies with long-established
legal standards, she said. </p>
<p>If the case went to trial, she said, we would present
substantial factual and legal defenses to the charges. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v.

<p>Lawsuits/Pretrial </p>
<p>Chevron Oil Spill Spurs Lawsuit to Freeze 17% of Brazil''s Rigs </p>
<p>The Brazilian prosecutor who filed a lawsuit against
Chevron Corp. (CVX) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG) said he''s seeking a
permanent ban on the companies'' operations in the South
American nation after an oil spill last month. </p>
<p>The lawsuit has been assigned to a federal judge and there
is no timeline yet for a possible ruling, Eduardo Santos, the
federal prosecutor in Campos, in Rio de Janeiro state, told
reporters yesterday. Santos, who is suing Chevron and Transocean
for 20 billion reais ($10.8 billion), said previous fines in the
millions of reais against other companies haven''t been enough in
preventing such accidents. </p>
<p>Brazil has to change the paradigm from millions to
billions, Santos said </p>
<p>The case imperils Brazil''s plan to boost crude output
because Transocean operates 10 of the 61 rigs working in the
country and it would be hard to replace them in a tight market
for oil equipment, said Judson Bailey, an analyst at Jefferies 
Co. Brazilian oil production growth has slowed after the country
increased safety requirements following the spill at BP Plc''s
Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico last year. </p>
<p>The rig market is pretty tight, so if Transocean were
banned, the oil companies wouldn''t be happy at all, Bailey
said in a phone interview from Houston. Chevron and Petrobras (PETR4)
can''t get a rig elsewhere, so it messes with the state-owned oil
company. </p>
<p>Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, and Transocean,
based in Vernier, Switzerland, said Dec. 14 that they haven''t
been notified and are cooperating with authorities. </p>
<p>Chevron has come under increased scrutiny in Brazil after
3,000 barrels of oil leaked last month from an oil field in deep
waters of the Campos Basin. The company underestimated the
amount of pressure at an oil deposit it was exploring, and crude
leaked from the reservoir for about eight days, George Buck, the
head of Chevron for Brazil, said on Nov. 20. </p>
<p>In the next few weeks, prosecutors will probably file a
criminal lawsuit against Chevron for alleged environmental
crime, said Romulo Sampaio, a law professor at Brazil''s Getulio Vargas Foundation. </p>

<p>Allen Stanford Amnesia Claim Not Credible,'' Prosecutors Say </p>
<p>R. Allen Stanford may be faking amnesia and should be tried
in January as scheduled on charges he led a $7 billion
investment fraud, prosecutors said, citing a prison medical
evaluation. </p>
<p>Stanford''s scores on medical and neuropsychological tests
were sufficiently low as to evidence that he either was not
trying or was faking, Assistant U.S. Attorney Gregg Costa
said, citing a doctor''s report. The prosecutor, in the proposed
court order filed yesterday, asked U.S. District Judge David
Hittner in Houston to find Stanford competent to stand trial. </p>
<p>A doctor who evaluated the defendant at a federal prison in
Butner, North Carolina, concluded that Stanford''s performance
indicated that he was blatantly simulating cognitive
defects/known to be malingering,'' Costa said. </p>
<p>Stanford, 61, has been imprisoned as a flight risk since
his June 2009 indictment on charges of defrauding investors
through a scheme built on allegedly bogus certificates of
deposit at Antigua-based Stanford International Bank Ltd. </p>
<p>Hittner delayed the trial, which had been set for last
January, after three doctors testified that Stanford was
incapable of assisting in his defense. They said Stanford had
become addicted to anxiety drugs prescribed in prison and could
be suffering lingering effects of a head injury suffered in a
2009 inmate assault. </p>
<p>Ali Fazel, Stanford''s lead criminal-defense attorney, urged
Hittner in a separate court filing to reject the Butner medical
evaluation and continue delaying Stanford''s trial. Fazel asked
the judge to rely on the testimony of experts Stanford''s defense
team plans to present at a competency hearing next week in
Houston. </p>
<p>Prosecutors claim Stanford skimmed more than $1 billion of
investor funds to finance a lavish lifestyle that included a
fleet of jets and yachts, several mansions and a private
Caribbean island, as well as financial support for women with
whom he has had children. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Stanford, 09-cr-342, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston). </p>

<p>Ex-Cuomo Aide Said to Be Among Possible Foreclosure Monitors </p>
<p>A former aide to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is among
candidates being considered to ensure that banks including
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) comply with any
settlement of a nationwide foreclosure probe, a person familiar
with the matter said. </p>
<p>Steven M. Cohen, who was the governor''s secretary, is one
potential foreclosure monitor, according to the person, who
declined to be identified because the negotiations are secret.
That person said North Carolina Commissioner of Banks Joseph A.
Smith Jr. is also a candidate, as did a second person who asked
not to be identified. </p>
<p>Selection of a monitor is one of the final issues to be
worked out between the banks and state and federal officials,
said the people. Selection of the monitor is a key issue for the
regulators because success of the agreement will largely depend
on his or her work, one of the people said. </p>
<p>Another candidate is Nicolas P. Retsinas, a former
assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, one of the people said. </p>
<p>All 50 states last year said they were investigating bank
foreclosure practices following disclosures that the companies
were using faulty documents in seizing homes. State and federal
officials leading the talks are seeking an agreement that
provides mortgage relief to homeowners and sets standards for
foreclosure practices. </p>
<p>The monitor would ensure compliance with any agreement with
mortgage servicers, according to a settlement proposal offered
to the banks in March. In addition to JPMorgan and Bank of
America, Citigroup Inc., Ally Financial Inc. and Wells Fargo 
Co. (WFC) are participating in the negotiations. </p>
<p>Cohen declined to comment on whether he was a candidate for
the monitor post. Smith declined to comment on any nomination to
monitor the foreclosure agreement. Retsinas didn''t return a call
seeking comment on the monitor position. </p>

<p>BP, TNK Billionaires Seek to Defeat Oil-Company Theft Claims </p>
<p>BP Plc and its billionaire partners in Russian oil venture
TNK-BP asked a New York judge to throw out claims against them
seeking more than $1 billion in damages over the alleged theft
of an oil company. </p>
<p>The lawsuit by Norex Petroleum Ltd. stems from more than a
decade of litigation in Russia and the U.S. over Yugraneft,
which owns an oil field in Western Siberia. Norex claims its
controlling stake in Yugraneft was stolen through corruption and
armed force and that BP and its partners profited off the scheme
at Norex''s expense. </p>
<p>BP and the other defendants in the lawsuit, including
billionaires Leonard Blavatnik and Victor Vekselberg, asked New
York State Supreme Court Justice Eileen Bransten in Manhattan
yesterday to dismiss the complaint. Norex has fought in Russian
and U.S. courts over Yugraneft and lost, they argue. </p>
<p>Norex cannot use this court as an appellate court to
overturn prior litigation decisions and outcomes, said Owen
Pell, an attorney at White  Case LLP who argued for dismissal.
They litigated all these issues in Russia. </p>
<p>Norex says that in 2001, militiamen wearing fatigues and
armed with AK-47 assault rifles, forcibly entered Yugraneft''s
corporate offices, telling employees that TNK had assumed
ownership of the company, according to the Norex complaint. The
men were acting at the direction of Blavatnik, Vekselberg and
Alfa Group, Norex said. </p>
<p>The assertions in Norex''s lawsuit are not only untrue,
they are simply a tired rehash of the same preposterous claims
they have been recycling for the past 12 years in both U.S. and
Russian courts, Mike Sitrick, a spokesman for Blavatnik, said
in an e-mailed statement. Previous lawsuits have been dismissed,
and we are confident plaintiff''s latest attempt will suffer
the same fate, he said. </p>
<p>Representatives of TNK-BP (TNBP) and Alfa Group couldn''t be
reached for comment. </p>
<p>The case is Norex Petroleum Ltd. v. Blavatnik,

<p>Ex-Primary Global Executive Fleishman Seeks Home Detention </p>
<p>James Fleishman, the former Primary Global Research LLC
executive convicted of conspiracy as part of a U.S. crackdown on
insider trading of consultants and fund managers, asked for a
sentence of 12 months'' home detention. </p>
<p>Fleishman, 42, of Santa Clara, California, is to be
sentenced Dec. 21 by U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff in
Manhattan. He asked for detention rather than prison in a court
filing Dec. 14 by his lawyer, Ethan A. Balogh </p>
<p>Mr. Fleishman does not present as a rogue employee,
secretly stealing his employer''s property for personal gain at
the expense of his employer, but instead as a man who worked for
essentially what became a rogue enterprise in which a legitimate
business model was structured in a way that misappropriation of
third-party information was likely to occur, Balogh said in
court papers. </p>
<p>Company management sought to shield itself from
liability when employees or consultants passed confidential
information, the attorney wrote. </p>
<p>Fleishman was convicted in September of two conspiracy
charges for a scheme to obtain and pass confidential information
from technology company employees moonlighting as consultants
for Mountain View, California-based Primary Global, a so-called
expert-networking firm. </p>
<p>Fleishman faces as long as 20 years in prison on the most
serious count, according to prosecutors. </p>

<p>Verdicts/Settlements </p>
<p>Chinese Drywall Maker to Pay $800 Million to Settle Suits </p>
<p>Knauf Plasterboard Tianjin Co., a Chinese drywall maker,
agreed to pay at least $800 million to settle homeowner claims
that faulty building materials contaminated their homes with
corrosive sulfur fumes, plaintiffs'' lawyers said. </p>
<p>Knauf agreed to resolve claims involving about 4,500
properties that contain the tainted drywall, lawyers for
property owners said yesterday in an e-mailed statement.
Homeowners said the faulty wallboard emits gases that corrode
copper coils and electrical and plumbing equipment. </p>
<p>KPT has agreed to provide thousands of families the
opportunity to recover losses caused by KPT drywall, Russ
Herman, a New Orleans-based lawyer representing property owners,
said in the statement. </p>
<p>The accord was announced yesterday before U.S. District
Judge Eldon Fallon in New Orleans, who is overseeing about
12,000 suits filed over the contaminated drywall that have been
consolidated for pretrial evidence gathering. KPT is a
subsidiary of Iphofen, Germany-based Knauf International, owned
by Knauf Group. </p>
<p>The $800 million figure is wildly speculative and
premature given the settlement terms, Greg Wallance, a KPT
lawyer, said yesterday at a press conference. We are confident
the figure will be considerably lower. </p>
<p>The agreement didn''t contain a minimum or maximum number on
the cost of repairing homes with the faulty drywall, Steven
Glickstein, another company lawyer, said in a telephone
interview. </p>
<p>The amount of the settlement will range from $800 million
to $1 billion, depending on the number of homeowners who can
prove they had KPT drywall, Herman said yesterday at a press
conference. </p>
<p>KPT payments won''t reach that level, Wallance said. Many
plaintiffs don''t have KPT drywall in their homes and actual
costs for remediation will be controlled through a competitive
bidding process, he said. Those who select a cash option
will receive a discounted settlement value. </p>

<p>Madoff''s Former Controller to Plead Guilty, U.S. Tells Court </p>
<p>Bernard Madoff''s ex-controller, Enrica Cotellessa-Pitz, is
expected to plead guilty to criminal charges stemming from her
former boss''s Ponzi scheme, the U.S. said in a court filing. </p>
<p>Cotellessa-Pitz, who hasn''t been charged yet, will admit to
falsifying documents to aid Madoff''s fraud and to deceiving U.S.
regulators, as part of a cooperation agreement with the
government, assistant U.S. attorneys Lisa Baroni and Julian
Moore told a federal judge in a letter yesterday. </p>
<p>Cotellessa-Pitz will plead guilty to four counts of
conspiracy, falsifying books and records of a broker-dealer,
falsifying books and records of an investment adviser and making
false filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,
the prosecutors said. The charges carry as long as 50 years in
prison, according to the letter to U.S District Judge Laura
Taylor Swain. </p>
<p>Madoff, who pleaded guilty to fraud charges, is serving 150
years in prison for the largest Ponzi scheme in U.S. history.
Investors lost about $20 billion in principal, the U.S. trustee
liquidating Madoff''s securities business has said. </p>
<p>David Rody, a lawyer for Cotellessa-Pitz, didn''t respond to
voice-mail and e-mail messages seeking comment on the letter. </p>
<p>The criminal case is U.S. v. O''Hara, No. 10-CR-228, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The
bankruptcy claim is Picard v. Cotellessa-Pitz, 10-4213, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<p>Bayer''s $750 Million Modified-Rice Settlement Now Binding </p>
<p>A Bayer AG (BAYN) unit said a $750 million settlement with U.S.
rice farmers who sued after their crops became tainted by a
genetically modified strain is binding now that the requisite
number of growers has accepted the deal. </p>
<p>First announced in July, the agreement ended scores of
cases filed against Bayer CropScience by growers in Arkansas,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas. </p>
<p>A sufficient number of now-verified registrations for the
settlement program have been filed by growers to represent 85
percent of U.S. long-grain rice acreage, a threshold point
established for the agreements to become binding, Bayer
CropScience said yesterday in a statement. </p>
<p>Bayer CropScience and a Louisiana State University facility
in Crowley were testing a strain of the rice for resistance to
Bayer''s Liberty-brand herbicide. </p>
<p>The genetically modified variety cross-bred with and
contaminated more than 30 percent of U.S. rice lands, Don
Downing, lawyer for the farmers, said at the first trial in
November 2009. </p>
<p>U.S. exports fell as the European Union, Japan, Russia and
other overseas buying ceased or was slowed for testing of U.S.-
grown long-grain rice, growers alleged. </p>
<p>Bayer CropScience denied the testing program was
negligently managed and claimed sale prices rebounded after the
initial drop. The unit of Leverkusen, Germany-based Bayer AG
said the trace amounts of the LibertyLink rice posed no threat
to people. </p>

md-01811, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Missouri (St.
Louis). </p>

<p>Pfizer Settled About Half of Prempro Cases, Adds to Reserve </p>
<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s largest drugmaker, has settled
almost half of the lawsuits over its menopause drugs and
increased the funds set aside to resolve the cases, the company
said in a regulatory filing. </p>
<p>Pfizer and its Wyeth and Pharmacia  Upjohn units have
resolved about 46 percent of suits that claimed the companies''
hormone-replacement medicines, including Prempro and Premarin,
caused breast cancer, according to the Securities and Exchange
Commission filing. Pfizer said it added $68 million to the $772
million it already reserved for the cases. </p>
<p>We have recorded a charge of $260 million in the first
nine months of 2011 that provides for the minimum expected costs
to resolve all the remaining hormone-replacement actions,
Pfizer officials said in the Nov. 10 filing. </p>
<p>More than 6 million women took Prempro and related
menopause drugs to treat symptoms including hot flashes and mood
swings before a 2002 study highlighted their links to cancer.
Wyeth''s sales of the medicines, which are still on the market,
exceeded $2 billion before the release of the Women''s Health
Initiative study sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. </p>
<p>Pfizer continues to have a strong record of success in
defending these cases, Chris Loder, a company spokesman, said
in an e-mailed statement. While we will continue to look for
opportunities to enter into favorable settlements where
appropriate, we will also continue to vigorously defend these
medicines in litigation. </p>
<p>Zoe Littlepage, a lawyer representing women suing Pfizer
over the menopause drugs, said that reserve doesn''t provide
enough compensation to spur settlements of outstanding claims. </p>
<p>Based upon the size of the jury verdicts to date, and the
fact that multiple appellate courts have now affirmed some of
those verdicts, this new amount of money set aside by Pfizer
seems grossly insufficient to resolve the remaining claims,
Littlepage said in an e-mailed statement. </p>

<p>ArcelorMittal (MT), Anglo Win Case Overturning Sishen Right Award </p>
<p>ArcelorMittal South Africa Ltd. (ACL) and Anglo American Plc (AAL) unit
Kumba Iron Ore won a bid to overturn the award of a right over
the country''s largest iron-ore mine to a company whose owners
include a business partner of President Jacob Zuma''s son. </p>
<p>The High Court set aside the award of a 21.4 percent permit
to the Sishen mine to Imperial Crown Trading 289 (Pty) Ltd.,
whose owners include Jagdish Parekh, a business partner of
Duduzane Zuma. The right was previously held by ArcelorMittal
South Africa, a unit of the world''s biggest steelmaker. Its
stock surged the most in 11 months in Johannesburg. </p>
<p>Sishen Iron Ore Co., owned by Kumba and Exxaro Resources
Ltd. (EXX), holds 100 percent of the right to the operation and the
21.4 percent portion was never available for conversion, Judge
Raymond Zondo said in the Pretoria court yesterday. </p>
<p>We are delighted that the judgment has confirmed that
Sishen Iron Ore is the only holder of the mining rights over
Sishen and that no other person including Imperial holds or may
be granted competing rights, Kumba said in an e-mailed
statement. With regards to the interpretation of the Mineral
and Petroleum Resources Development Act, we need to await the
full judgment and the reasons for the court''s decision. </p>
<p>Zondo''s full ruling will be available on Dec. 20, he said. </p>
<p>ArcelorMittal South Africa is pleased about the ruling,
spokesman Themba Hlengani said in an interview. It confirms
our long-held view Kumba applied for and was granted 100 percent
of the right in the first instance. </p>
<p>The Vanderbijlpark-based steelmaker''s Sishen right lapsed
after it failed to apply for a license by April 30, 2009, to
satisfy a change in legislation. </p>
<p>Imperial will appeal the ruling early in the new year,
Ronnie Mendelow, the company''s lawyer, said in Pretoria. </p>
<p>The Department of Mineral Resources, which opposed the
action, will await the full judgment on the ruling before
commenting and will take legal advice on how to proceed further,
it said in an e-mailed statement. </p>

<p>Greedy'' Insider Trader Jailed for Using Hedge-Fund Tips </p>
<p>A London management consultant was sentenced to two years
in prison after being convicted of making about 500,000 pounds
($774,000) using confidential tips from a hedge-fund trader. </p>
<p>Jurors found Rupinder Sidhu guilty on 22 of 23 insider-
dealing charges yesterday, said Chris Hamilton, a spokesman for
the U.K. Financial Services Authority, which filed the case. A
separate charge of money laundering wasn''t considered. </p>
<p>You are greedy, Judge Michael Gledhill told Sidhu
yesterday. Sheer greed is behind all these offenses. </p>
<p>Sidhu, 40, used information from AKO Capital LLP trader
Anjam Ahmad about the hedge fund''s trading plans to spread bet
on companies including Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER), Swatch Group (UHR) AG
and Michael Page International Plc (MPI) between June and August 2009,
prosecutors said. He is the eighth person sentenced to prison
for insider trading in a case brought by the FSA. </p>
<p>Sidhu denied all the charges, claiming he didn''t know Ahmad
was passing on inside information. In a June 2010 trial, Ahmad
was given a suspended jail sentence of 10 months, 300 hours of
community service and fined 50,000 pounds after pleading guilty
to insider trading. </p>

<p>Sam Hurd''s arrest on a federal
charge of conspiracy to distribute cocaine will cause months of
public-relations headaches for the National Football League
without driving fans away from the most-watched sport in the
U.S., analysts said. </p>
<p>They''re not turning off the TV, they''re not shying away
from fantasy sports and they''re not giving up gambling on games
because of this, David Carter, executive director of the
Sports Business Institute at the University of Southern
California''s Marshall School of Business, said in a telephone
interview yesterday. </p>
<p>Hurd, a 26-year-old wide receiver for the Chicago Bears,
was charged in a criminal complaint filed yesterday in Dallas
with one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to
distribute 500 grams or more of a cocaine mixture. If convicted,
Hurd faces a minimum of five years and a maximum of 40 years in
federal prison. </p>
<p>The NFL has more than $9 billion in annual revenue and the
charge against Hurd rivals other issues the league has faced,
such as dog fighting, shootings and performance-enhancing drug
use, Carter said. </p>
<p>This is not going to go away, Carter said. It''s going
to be an ongoing issue because they''re going to have to wait for
the legal process to play out and something like this would
appear to be pretty high profile, coming from a big market and a
guy who''s been in the league for several years. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)''s push into cloud
computing will help the company compete with Google Inc. (GOOG), Apple
Inc. (AAPL) and Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM) It also will hurt profit margins. </p>
<p>The company''s cloud software lets corporate customers pay a
subscription to do things like manage spreadsheets and corporate
websites with software stored and run on Microsoft''s servers.
The new services also help users view TV shows and edit photos
on the Web. </p>
<p>While that may be great news for customers, the cost of
storing software in Microsoft''s own data centers, combined with
other expenses, means the company may miss profit estimates for
fiscal 2012, said Heather Bellini, an analyst at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. It also means the good old days of outsized margins
for the software giant may be a thing of the past, said Jason Maynard, an analyst at Wells Fargo (WFC) Securities. </p>
<p>Nothing will ever be as high as the old model, said
Maynard, who''s based in San Francisco. </p>
<p>Profit margins, which shrank to a 22-year low in 2011, are
set to fall further. Gross margins, or the percentage of sales
left after production costs, will narrow 1.6 points to 76
percent in fiscal 2012, the average estimate of analysts
compiled by Bloomberg. That''s after a 2.4-point drop in 2011. </p>
<p>The challenge to Microsoft''s margins stems from decisions
Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer has made in recent years
to invest in new businesses, such as adding content for Xbox and
acquiring Skype Technologies SA for $8.5 billion. </p>
<p>Rising Costs </p>
<p>The pressure will persist beyond this year as more
customers switch to cloud computing, which involves hosting
software on Microsoft''s servers and delivered it over the
Internet. That shifts the cost of storing and operating those
programs to Microsoft. </p>
<p>Microsoft traditionally sold packaged software that, once
developed, costs little to manufacture and distribute. In moving
more business to the cloud, the world''s largest software maker
must take on the costs of running data centers. These expenses
include powering, cooling, housing and maintaining servers that
run the programs for clients. </p>
<p>Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co.,
estimates that cloud-related costs will range from 15 percent to
25 percent of revenue. That''s about 10 percent more than selling
standard packaged software, he said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s Bellini said analysts may not be taking
into account a large enough increase in cost of goods sold for
the fiscal year ending in June, which could cause Microsoft to
miss profit predictions. Even Bellini, who lowered her
projection for gross margins and trimmed 9 cents from her
overall profit estimate, said she may not have cut enough. </p>
<p>Microsoft declined to comment for this story. </p>
<p>Growth Challenges </p>
<p>Margin pressure is making some investors leery of Microsoft
stock, and may weigh on the shares in coming months, said Walter
Price, who manages the $3 billion Allianz RCM Technology Fund at
RCM Capital Management in San Francisco. </p>
<p>The shares, which gained 1.7 percent to $26 on Dec. 16,
have declined 6.8 percent this year before today. </p>
<p>Microsoft was already facing a challenging year for profit
growth. The European debt crisis and a sluggish economic
recovery have prompted government and financial customers to
pare spending, while the PC industry is reeling from flooding in
Thailand that has slashed production of hard drives. </p>
<p>Companies will boost spending on software and computers at
a slower rate next year than 2011, according to Gartner Inc.,
which said it may cut its forecast even further at the end of
the quarter. Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ), the largest computer maker,
last month said it''s started to see businesses curb spending. </p>
<p>Xbox Content Fees </p>
<p>Microsoft''s product cycles also point to a year of slower
growth in its flagship Windows and Office software businesses,
according to Rick Sherlund, an analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc.
The two divisions will expand more slowly this year as customers
wait for an update to the Windows operating system, which
Sherlund expects in October. Microsoft is likely to follow that
with a touch-enabled version of Office productivity software, he
said. </p>
<p>At the same time, costs are rising across businesses.
Microsoft''s Xbox game consoles, which are selling well, are more
expensive to manufacture than software, and the company is
paying more licensing fees for content to run on the Xbox Live
service. </p>
<p>The addition of Skype, increased demand for consulting
services in the server business, and costs of Microsoft''s search
partnership with Yahoo! Inc. are also adding to the jump in
expenses. </p>
<p>Need for Scale </p>
<p>Including the impact of Skype, operating expenses for the
year will be as much as $29.2 billion, up from a previous
forecast of $28.6 billion, Microsoft said in October. </p>
<p>Reining in cloud computing costs will be key, and that will
depend on how efficient Microsoft can become at running its
massive data centers. The company will need to attract large
numbers of cloud customers to get the services running at scale.
And it will have to remain vigilant on data-center energy and
cooling costs, said Sanford C. Bernstein''s Moerdler. </p>
<p>They should be able to be pretty efficient and they
should be able to generate net more revenue so the margin will
go down, but earnings per share will go up, he said. That''s in
line with Microsoft''s own forecasts since starting its move to
the cloud. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) won a ruling that
Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc.''s Android phones violate one of
its smartphone patents, while failing to convince a judge that
six others are being infringed as well. </p>
<p>Motorola Mobility, which is being acquired by Google Inc. (GOOG),
violated a patent for generating meeting requests and group
scheduling, U.S. International Trade Commission Judge Theodore Essex said in a notice today. The finding is the second in two
days from the ITC that has determined that some features of
phones running Google''s Android operating system are using
licensed technology without permission. </p>
<p>As Samsung, HTC, Acer and other companies have
recognized, respecting others'' intellectual property through
licensing is the right path forward, said David Howard, deputy
general counsel for Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft. </p>
<p>The ruling falls short of the broader claims originally
sought by Microsoft, which has said its inventions are being
widely used in Android phones. Motorola Mobility General Counsel
Scott Offer said the majority of the ruling is favorable to the
handset maker and may provide clarity on what Microsoft owns to
avoid potential infringement. </p>
<p>They''re talking about removing that feature from the
product very quickly to avoid infringement, but I''m not sure how
easy that is, said David Mixon, a patent lawyer at Bradley
Arant Boult Cummings LLP in Huntsville, Alabama, who''s followed
the case. Being found to infringe is never a good thing. </p>
<p>Settlement Is Best'' </p>
<p>Settlement is always the best way, Mixon said. At the
end of everything, this is still a business dispute and business
disputes are almost always settled with money. </p>
<p>The patent is among those that cover a Microsoft program
called ActiveSync, which is broadly licensed through the
industry, including to Apple (AAPL) Inc. and Google. </p>
<p>The judge''s finding are subject to review by the six-member
commission, which can ban imports of products that infringe U.S.
patents. Google said it had no comment on the case. </p>
<p>The Motorola Mobility ruling follows a loss yesterday for
HTC Corp. (2498), which was defending itself from claims that its
Android phones were using technology from Cupertino, California-
based Apple without permission. Taoyuan, Taiwan-based HTC said
yesterday it would be able to work around data-detection
technology that had been found to infringe. </p>
<p>Microsoft also has a case against Barnes  Noble Inc. (BKS),
whose Nook e-reader runs Android. </p>
<p>Smartphone Experience </p>
<p>Microsoft, the world''s largest software maker, has sought
to block U.S. sales of Motorola Mobility''s Android-based
devices, including Xoom tablets and the Atrix, Droid 2, Droid X,
Cliq XT, Devour, Backflip, Charm and Cliq smartphones. </p>
<p>Microsoft had claimed the Motorola Mobility products
infringed seven patents that are essential to the smartphone
user experience. They include a patent issued in 1998 for a
system that lets people select file names without being limited
to 11 characters; one issued in 2005 for a technique to update a
contact database; and a patent issued in 2010 covering a way to
know the device''s signal or battery strength. </p>
<p>The patent found to be infringed was issued in 2002 for a
way to generate meeting requests among a group. </p>
<p>Microsoft filed the Motorola Mobility complaint in 2010
after the Libertyville, Illinois-based handset maker refused to
pay royalties. </p>
<p>Xbox Case </p>
<p>In a court hearing in Munich last week over German patent-
infringement claims brought by Microsoft, a Motorola Mobility
lawyer, Marcus Grosch, said the companies haven''t made much
progress on a possible settlement since a meeting in October. A
Microsoft lawyer, Peter Hess, told the court that any settlement
would have to wait until Google completes its $12.5 billion
acquisition of Motorola Mobility. </p>
<p>Google, based in Mountain View, California, has said one
reason for buying Motorola Mobility was to obtain patents that
could be used as a bulwark against a surge of lawsuits targeting
handsets and tablet computers that use Android. </p>
<p>Motorola Mobility has its own patent claims against
Microsoft in the U.S. and in Europe. A case at the ITC targets
the Xbox video-gaming system. Judge Essex, who is overseeing
that case, is scheduled to release his findings on Jan. 23,
according to the ITC''s website. </p>
<p>Microsoft continues to infringe Motorola Mobility''s
substantial patent portfolio, the handset maker said in its
statement today. Motorola Mobility remains confident in its
position and will continue to move forward with its
complaints. </p>
<p>Barnes  Noble </p>
<p>A trial in Microsoft''s case against Barnes  Noble is
scheduled before Essex in February and involves different
patents. New York-based Barnes  Noble, the largest U.S.
bookstore chain, has accused Microsoft of misusing its patents
to obtain royalties on Android devices, and has asked the U.S.
Justice Department to investigate whether Microsoft is trying to
drive up the cost of Android to push out competition. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s case against Motorola Mobility is In the Matter
of Certain Mobile Devices, Associated Software and Components
Thereof, 337-744, while Motorola Mobility''s case against
Microsoft is In the matter of Gaming and Entertainment Consoles,
337-752, both U.S. International Trade Commission (Washington). </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX), the operator of the
Brazilian offshore well that triggered oil leaks, and rig owner
Transocean Ltd. (RIG) will defend executives threatened with criminal
indictments in the South American nation. </p>
<p>Chevron learned that Brazil''s federal police intend to
indict employees involved in the drilling that led to the Nov. 7
leaks from seafloor fissures near the $3.6 billion Frade
development, Kurt Glaubitz, a spokesman for the San Ramon,
California-based company, said in a statement late yesterday.
Transocean, in a separate statement late yesterday, said it will
vigorously defend the company and its collaborators. </p>
<p>Chevron, the second-largest U.S. energy company by market
value, has been fined 50 million reais ($26.9 million) and
ordered to halt all drilling and crude production off Brazil''s
coast after discovering the leaks last month. Chevron estimated
the volume of the seeps at 3,000 barrels during the eight days
it took for the company to locate and halt the leaks. </p>
<p>Chevron and other offshore oil explorers are facing
increased scrutiny of their drilling practices in the wake of BP
Plc''s 2010 blowout of a well in the Gulf of Mexico that killed
11 workers and led to the worst U.S. offshore crude spill. </p>
<p>In Brazil, the concerns have been compounded as the coastal
city Rio de Janeiro prepares to host the 2014 World Cup and the
Olympic Games two years later. Chevron''s Frade oil field is
about 230 miles (370 kilometers) northeast of Rio in a region of
the Atlantic Ocean known as the Campos Basin. </p>
<p>Employees Indicted </p>
<p>Chevron underestimated the amount of pressure at an oil
deposit it was exploring, and crude leaked from the reservoir
for about eight days, George Buck, president of Chevron''s
Brazilian subsidiary, said on Nov. 20. Buck was among 17 Chevron
and Transocean employees targeted for indictments, the Folha de
S. Paulo newspaper reported yesterday. Glaubitz declined to
identify the employees targeted for indictment. George wasn''t
available to comment, the spokesman said. </p>
<p>Anthony Dovkants, a spokesman for Vernier, Switzerland-
based Transocean, said in an e-mailed statement that the
allegations were without merit. </p>
<p>Chevron rose 0.8 percent to $106.31 at the close as oil
prices climbed above $100 a barrel in New York. Transocean rose
0.4 percent to $40.04. </p>
<p>BP has booked more than $40 billion in losses related to
last year''s Gulf disaster that sank Transocean''s Deepwater
Horizon rig and spilled an estimated 4.9 million barrels of
crude. The London-based oil producer also faces hundreds of
lawsuits by fishermen, hoteliers and property owners in coastal
areas where crude washed ashore. </p>
<p>Other Oil Spills </p>
<p>ConocoPhillips, the third-largest U.S. oil company, said
yesterday it''s taking responsibility for two oil spills in
China''s Bohai Bay in June and is setting up compensation funds
to support environmental research and affected communities. </p>
<p>Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Europe''s largest oil company, shut
its 200,000 barrel-a-day Bonga field off Nigeria after a leak
during a tanker loading caused what may be the country''s worst
offshore spill in more than a decade. The Bonga deep-water
discovery produces almost 10 percent of Nigeria''s crude. </p>

<p>Brazil''s threatened indictment of
Chevron Corp. (CVX) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG) executives after offshore oil
leaks shows that regulators from the North Sea to the Indian
Ocean are stepping up scrutiny after BP Plc''s 2010 disaster. </p>
<p>Brazilian authorities have said they may prosecute
employees, shut operations and exact more than $10 billion in
fines after the leaks at the Frade field 230 miles (370
kilometers) off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. The spill occurred
19 months after an explosion in the Gulf of Mexico killed 11
workers and triggered the biggest offshore U.S. oil spill. </p>
<p>Governments around the world are paying closer attention to
how energy explorers drill into high-pressure deposits of crude
and natural gas as much as 8 miles beneath the sea surface.
Chevron''s Brazil incident took place after a ConocoPhillips (COP) leak
in China and prior to what may be Nigeria''s biggest spill in a
decade at a Royal Dutch Shell Plc facility. </p>
<p>There''s been just such a rash of them that governments
have got to act tough with oil companies, Allen Brooks, a
managing director at energy-investment bank PPHB LP in Houston
and Chevron shareholder, said in a phone interview. Since the BP
accident every spill after that is heightened in terms of
media attention and obviously government concern. </p>

<p>Visa Inc. (V), the world''s biggest bank-
card network, will deposit $1.57 billion into its litigation
escrow account, the biggest addition in three years as the
company prepares to resolve price-fixing accusations. </p>
<p>Visa will draw on funds allocated to a $2 billion Class A
share-buyback announced this year, the San Francisco-based
company said today in a statement. Because of Visa''s multiple-
class system of shares, the move will have the same effect on
earnings per share as repurchasing Class A stock, it said. </p>
<p>Merchants sued Visa, MasterCard Inc. and banks including
JPMorgan Chase  Co. in 2005, claiming that the companies
squelched competition by banning merchants from steering
customers to cheaper forms of payment. An accord may cost $4
billion, and in February, the defendants agreed that Visa would
be responsible for two-thirds of any settlement. </p>
<p>Transferring money away from buybacks will exhaust all
funds available under that program, Visa said. Class A shares
rose 50 cents to $101.40 at 10:27 a.m. in New York. </p>
<p>A settlement of the case, which involves interchange or
swipe fees on credit cards, may be at least $4 billion,
according to MasterCard (MA)''s estimate in November of a possible
loss of at least $500 million. Purchase, New York-based
MasterCard would be responsible for about one-eighth of the
settlement. </p>
<p>Visa didn''t specify a purpose for today''s addition to the
escrow account. The company deposited $1.2 billion into the
account in its 2011 fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30, and
paid out $280 million, increasing the size to $2.86 billion. </p>
<p>The firm said in its November annual regulatory filing that
the $2.7 billion uncommitted balance of the account was
deposited primarily with a view toward resolving the price-
fixing litigation. </p>

<p>A Morgan Stanley (MS) real estate fund
relinquished its 80 percent stake in European mall developer
Multi Corp. BV as part of an 850 million-euro ($1.11 billion)
debt restructuring this week, two people with knowledge of the
agreement said. </p>
<p>NIBC Bank NV led a group of 11 lenders that took over
Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund V International''s holding in a
deal that was completed Dec. 20, said the people, who declined
to be identified because the information is private. </p>
<p>As part of the accord, the Morgan Stanley fund gained a
stake of more than 10 percent in the Forum Turkey Fund, which
owns seven malls in the country, the people said. Canada Pension
Plan Investment Board previously held 27 percent of Forum Turkey
Fund and Multi owned the rest. </p>
<p>Multi spokesman Mark Cunningham declined to comment, as did
Morgan Stanley spokesman Tom Walton. </p>
<p>The banks agreed in September to back Multi Chairman Hans van Veggel and the company''s senior management. Together the
executives hold the remaining shares in the Gouda, Netherlands-
based company, which owns, manages and develops malls in 14
European countries. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley may recover its losses in Multi through the
stake in Forum Turkey Fund, which plans to get real estate
investment trust status in Turkey and sell shares in an initial
public offering in Istanbul in coming years. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley was part of the group that acquired Dutch
publicly traded real estate developer AM Development BV in early
2006. </p>
<p>AM Development was split in two, with the Morgan Stanley
fund backing the separate international mall development
business led by van Veggel and his management team. That became
Multi, while AM Development remained a separate company
specializing in residential and office projects. </p>
<p>Multi reduced its debt in October after raising about 300
million euros from the sale of two malls in the Czech Republic
to a venture between Meyer Bergman BV and Healthcare of Ontario
Pension Plan. </p>

<p>World War II''s Battle for Cassino
leveled the Italian town and its hilltop abbey. Now, the 33,000
residents are digging out from the rubble left by Wall Street. </p>
<p>Six decades after U.S.-led forces ousted the Nazis from
Cassino, a new generation is grappling with the fallout from the
debts of postwar rebuilding -- borrowings that grew because of a
derivative that backfired. Soaring costs forced Cassino, 80
miles southeast of Rome, to settle an interest-rate swap with
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) in 2009, leaving the town unable to pay for
daycare for 60 infants and services for the poor. </p>
<p>For Iris Volante, who chairs Cassino''s assembly finance
committee, the bankers who share responsibility for peddling the
derivatives should pay with their jobs. She, like Occupy Wall
Street protesters around the world, is demanding an overhaul of
the financial system to stop history from repeating itself. </p>
<p>Heads rolling is the least we would expect, Volante, a
57-year-old gynecologist who also has worked for the city for
more than a decade, said in an interview in a Cassino cafe
earlier this month. When people''s attitude is to cheat others,
new rules are needed to prevent it happening again. </p>
<p>Cassino, whose government office overlooks a U.S. tank and
other war relics in the town''s central square, plans to cut
funding for its daycare center and may ask families to pay
several hundred euros a month per child after running out of
other cost-cutting measures, said Volante. The town already has
reduced staff to about 250 employees from about 450 by not
replacing those who left or retired, she said. </p>
<p>Milan Trial </p>
<p>While the New York-based bank led by Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon has no retail branches in Italy, it didn''t
hesitate to sell complex swaps to municipalities over the past
decade. In Milan, JPMorgan and its employees are on trial, along
with Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Germany''s Depfa Bank Plc
and Switzerland''s UBS AG, for allegedly tricking the city into
buying the contracts in 2005. The banks deny any wrongdoing. </p>
<p>Across Italy, cities faced with shrinking income and rising
expenses bought swaps from JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by
assets, and other lenders to cut short-term interest costs,
putting them at risk of paying more in the long run. Cassino
purchased a 22 million-euro ($28.7 million) contract from New
York-based Bear Stearns Cos., acquired by JPMorgan in 2008,
which switched interest payments on the town''s debt from a fixed
rate to a variable one. The rate, a record low at the time the
contract was signed in 2003, soared over subsequent years. </p>
<p>About 300 municipalities, from the toe of Italy''s boot to
the Alps, were losing a total of 912 million euros on such
derivatives as of March, Bank of Italy data show. </p>
<p>Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for JPMorgan in London,
declined to comment. </p>
<p>Jefferson County </p>
<p>Local governments and regulators in Germany and the U.S.
also have brought cases against banks, including JPMorgan, over
derivatives contracts. </p>
<p>The German city of Pforzheim sued JPMorgan a year ago over
56 million euros of losses on interest-rate swaps. A hearing at
the Frankfurt Regional Court is scheduled for Jan. 16. Marchiony
declined to comment on the case. </p>
<p>In the U.S., JPMorgan was investigated by the Justice
Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and attorneys
general in 25 states for its role in rigging the bids of
investment contracts. The bank agreed to a $228 million
settlement this year on charges that it conspired to overcharge
cities at taxpayer expense, acknowledging responsibility for
illegal, anticompetitive conduct by former employees. </p>
<p>In 2009, JPMorgan entered a $722 million accord with the
SEC to end an investigation into its role in selling derivatives
that helped push Jefferson County, Alabama, to declare the
biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. The bank paid $75
million in fines and restitution and wrote off $647 million it
was owed by the county. </p>
<p>Interest-Rate Swaps </p>
<p>The sales happened before Dimon took over as CEO in 2006.
In September 2008, the bank said it would stop marketing
interest-rate swaps to municipalities. </p>
<p>Banks globally sold $707.6 trillion of over-the-counter
derivatives as of June 30, about 18 percent more than the $601
trillion at the end of 2010, according to data published by the
Bank for International Settlements last month. Counterparties
would have to pay $19.5 trillion to replace the contracts at
market rates, the data show. </p>
<p>Interest-rate swaps account for more than three-quarters of
the total, BIS data show. The Basel, Switzerland-based group
doesn''t break out what percentage is bought by municipalities. </p>
<p>JPMorgan was the largest global dealer of interest-rate
derivatives among U.S. banks in the third quarter, according to
data from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The
bank had $75.4 trillion in notional derivatives within its
JPMorgan Chase Bank NA subsidiary, of which 77 percent, or about
$58.1 trillion, were interest-rate contracts, the data show. </p>
<p>Without Thinking'' </p>
<p>Dimon, 55, led the charge in the U.S. against new banking
regulation, criticizing Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke
in June for saddling lenders with too many proposed rules. The
rules, to be overseen by the Fed, are meant to avert future
financial crises and banking abuses. </p>
<p>Banks pitched deals without thinking about the well-being
of others and created lots of financial problems for many
towns, said Carmelo Palombo, a former Cassino official who
helped negotiate the settlement with JPMorgan. The agreement
stopped the city from losing even more money, said Palombo,
without providing details. </p>
<p>Secret Settlement </p>
<p>A 2001 Italian law said local authorities could buy swaps
only if the transactions would improve municipal finances. Italy
banned governments from signing new derivatives contracts in
mid-2008, and the Senate finance committee approved
recommendations in March 2010 that would prevent towns that
aren''t provincial capitals and have fewer than 100,000 residents
from using derivatives. Those rules are still pending. </p>
<p>Cassino sought to keep the settlement terms secret, citing
a confidentiality clause in its agreement with JPMorgan. An
administrative court in Latina, Italy, in September backed a
case brought by Bloomberg News under Italian freedom of
information law asking the town to make the swaps contract and
settlement public. </p>
<p>The city plans to comply with the court order, said Enzo
Salera, Cassino''s finance chief. </p>
<p>In Milan, Dimon''s bankers say they played by the book,
adhering to rules that allow swaps dealers to withhold details,
including how much they''re charging their customers. Hidden
charges on derivatives contracts are what Milan prosecutor
Alfredo Robledo says made them fraudulent. </p>
<p>Robledo says banks charged 101 million euros in fees in
selling the derivatives that adjusted payments on the city''s 1.7
billion-euro bond offering in 2005 and in later restructurings. </p>
<p>Gross Margin </p>
<p>Every time I sold a derivative to a public
administration, even before getting to the details, the first
question was always, How does the bank make money?'' Antonia Creanza, an executive director at JPMorgan in London said in
court Sept. 21 under questioning by her lawyer. I would
explain that we would retain a margin. Never has a legal adviser
told me, Look you need to detail the gross margin.'' </p>
<p>Banks seek to earn a gross margin when they agree to a swap
with a client by skewing the terms to their advantage, Creanza,
42, a member of the bank''s interest-rate team at the time of the
Milan deal, testified on Sept. 28. </p>
<p>The gross margin is photographed when the deal is
struck, Creanza said. That value is then managed by a trader
over the life of the contract, its magnitude varying as the
derivative agreement changes in value, she said. The final
profit for the bank can''t be known until maturity, said Creanza,
who declined to elaborate further. </p>
<p>Asymmetry of Information'' </p>
<p>The bank didn''t tell the city of Milan how much it was
charging, and the municipality could have sought competing bids
from other banks or independent advice, she said. </p>
<p>Creanza said she earned a bonus that year, a payment
JPMorgan had guaranteed irrespective of her performance when the
firm lured her from a competitor in December 2004. She didn''t
say what the bonus was. </p>
<p>The city of Milan is seeking damages as part of the
criminal trial. </p>
<p>There''s an asymmetry of information between banks and
local governments, which have stringent limits, not least in
their spending, Letizia Moratti, 62, Milan''s mayor from 2006
through May of this year, said in court last month. There was
a clear conflict that the banks didn''t highlight. </p>
<p>Watershed Events </p>
<p>In Cassino, which lies on an ancient road connecting Naples
and Rome, residents curse two watershed events: the five-month
battle in 1944 that claimed more than 70,000 casualties and
turned the town into a moonscape, and the day in 2003 that the
government entered a seven-year swap with Bear Stearns. </p>
<p>The contract, which adjusted payments on about 22 million
euros of debt, switched the city''s 4.7 percent fixed interest
rate for a variable one, according to a June 2009 report by
Italy''s financial police. The floating rate was based on the
U.S.-dollar London interbank offered rate, or Libor, an
extremely risky bet given that it was at a record low,
police said in testimony to the Italian Senate that month. </p>
<p>Three-month U.S. dollar-Libor was at 1 percent in June 2003
and by January 2006 had surpassed 4.7 percent, according to data
compiled by the British Bankers'' Association. The measure
climbed as high as 5.7 percent in September 2007 as credit
markets began to seize up, before declining to a record low of
0.25 percent by December 2009 after policy makers cut rates. </p>
<p>Depleted Funds </p>
<p>Cassino started losing money on the swap with the third
half-yearly payment, paying about 2 million euros after Libor
soared, according to police testimony. That depleted funds
intended for sanitation and road works that the city raises from
parking tickets and federal grants. </p>
<p>The transaction was presented as advantageous to the
municipality at the time, said Volante, who worked as a city
culture chief when Bear Stearns pitched the deal. </p>
<p>For Cassino, whose rundown postwar architecture bears
little of the ancient charm of neighboring towns, the challenge
now is to cut services without damaging the most vulnerable
residents, said Danilo Grossi, the city''s education chief. </p>
<p>A new administration, which took over after May elections,
will boost charges for the city-run nursery starting next year
to help pay the 900,000 euros it costs to operate annually, said
Grossi. Talks with the families have begun, he said. The town is
still grappling with a shortfall that in 2010 forced out the
previous administration and led the federal government to take
financial control of the municipality. </p>
<p>Helping the Poor </p>
<p>Cassino''s pain has increased as Italy''s economy contracted
in the third quarter, signaling that the country may have
entered its fifth recession since 2001. Facing soaring borrowing
costs amid investor concern that the nation may struggle to
repay its debt, Prime Minister Mario Monti''s government is
adopting austerity measures that may further weigh on growth. </p>
<p>While Cassino eventually extracted itself from the swap,
the damage may be lasting, according to Giuseppe Lauro, a
retired manager for Italy''s largest power company, Enel SpA (ENEL), who
now volunteers for church-sponsored charity Caritas Italiana.
The shrinking local economy and cuts in city spending are
creating a growing class of poor, he said. </p>
<p>On a foggy December morning, as local politicians were busy
hosting Italy''s Chamber Speaker Gianfranco Fini to mark the
150th anniversary of the nation''s unification with songs in the
town''s Teatro Manzoni, Lauro was looking after the poor, picking
up the pieces of the city''s financial wreckage. </p>
<p>About half of those who sought assistance from Caritas in
Cassino for the first time in 2009 were of working age, seeking
help with paying bills and food and clothes, a 2009 study by the
charity showed. More than half of those who relied on Caritas
were below 40. </p>
<p>We need more city funds, Lauro, 66, said in an
interview at the charity''s shelter, a few hundred yards from
town hall. The city''s demise means there are new poor and
they''re younger. They need jobs. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley, the bank whose

today that 580 of the 1,600 job cuts announced earlier this
month may come from New York City. </p>
<p>Rolling layoffs began Dec. 15, the New York-based firm
said in a submission to the state''s Labor Department. Affected
locations include 1221 Avenue of the Americas, 1 New York Plaza,
1585 Broadway and 750 Seventh Ave., the filing shows. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, 53, is grappling with
Europe''s debt crisis and concern that U.S. economic growth will
slow, crimping demand for trading and investment-banking

than 200,000 jobs globally this year. </p>
<p>Reductions will occur globally at all levels of the firm,
Mark Lake, a company spokesman, said on Dec. 15. The 1,600
figure amounts to about 2.6 percent of the 62,648 employees
Morgan Stanley (MS) had at the end of September. The decision to
reduce staff came as we conduct our year-end performance-
management process and evaluate the right size of the franchise
for 2012, Lake said at the time. </p>

<p>Electricite de France SA (EDF), Europe''s
biggest power generator, reached an agreement to raise its stake
in Edison SpA (EDN) to 80.7 percent for about 700 million euros ($915
million), ending a yearlong effort to take control of the
Italian utility. </p>
<p>The French power producer will effectively exchange a 50
percent stake in Edipower, an Edison subsidiary, for Transalpina
di Energia Srl''s 50 percent stake in Edison, Thomas Piquemal,
EDF''s chief financial officer, said on a conference call today.
The purchase will raise EDF''s stake in Edison to 80.7 percent at
an implied share price of 84 euro cents, according to a
statement from the Paris-based company. </p>
<p>EDF, which currently owns 50 percent of Edison, has been
trying to take full control for more than a year to gain access
to natural-gas resources and markets in southeastern Europe and
the Mediterranean basin. The value of the acquisition is a 1
percent premium to Edison''s 83.15 euro cent closing price on
Dec. 23. </p>
<p>The deal doesn''t look negative for EDF, Benoit de Broissia, an analyst at KBL Richelieu Gestion in Paris, said by
phone today. EDF wanted control of Edison without spending a
lot of cash. It was a difficult situation. </p>
<p>Standard  Poor''s cut Edison''s credit rating and Moody''s
Investors Services placed it on review for a downgrade after the
Italian utility reported a nine-month loss in October. The
agreement will reduce Edison''s debt by 1.1 billion euros and
will reassure rating agencies, Piquemal said. </p>
<p>Move Quickly'' </p>
<p>Edison fell 1.7 percent to 81.7 euro cents at the close in
Milan. EDF fell 1.5 cents to 18.4 euros. The preliminary accord
requires approval from the companies'' boards before the end of
next month, with final contracts signed by Feb. 15, EDF said. </p>
<p>We want to move quickly, Piquemal said. We no longer
want to be under pressure by ratings agencies. </p>
<p>Edison is the latest Italian company to be taken over by
the French. Groupe Lactalis won control of Parmalat SpA and LVMH
Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA bought Bulgari SpA earlier this
year. </p>
<p>Criticism of these purchases led EDF Chief Executive
Officer Henri Proglio to say in July he wouldn''t negotiate on
taking control of Edison until Italian authorities give their
approval. </p>
<p>We reached an agreement and authorities said they didn''t
want it because of cheese and jewelry, Proglio said July 29
about a previous Edison deal that was scuttled. Another
agreement reached in October looked uncertain earlier this month
amid disagreements over debt and governance. </p>
<p>Piquemal declined to comment on the politics behind today''s
deal. </p>
<p>Consob Decision </p>
<p>I''m particularly satisfied with the success of the
negotiations between EDF and A2A and its main Italian
partners, Corrado Passera, Italy''s Minister of Economic
Development, said in an e-mailed statement. A2A becomes the
country''s second biggest power company by taking control of
Edipower, he said. </p>
<p>The transaction depends on EDF getting Italian market
regulator Consob to agree that a mandatory public tender offer
for Edison doesn''t exceed 84 euro cents a share, according to
the statement. </p>
<p>We are ready to make a general offer if the regulator
confirms this price, Piquemal said. It''s up to the Consob to
decide. </p>
<p>Transalpina, known as TdE, is currently half owned by EDF
and half by Delmi SpA, which in turn is owned by A2A and other
Italian companies. EDF currently owns 20 percent of Edison
directly and 30 percent through TdE. </p>
<p>Simplified'' Agreement </p>
<p>Delmi plans to acquire a 50 percent stake in Edipower from
Edison and 20 percent from Alpiq for 600 million euros and 200
million euros respectively, according to the statement. Edipower
will then be 70 percent owned by Delmi, 20 percent by A2A and 10
percent by Iren. </p>
<p>The agreement is simplified compared to one reached in
October because Delmi shareholders will no longer have a stake
in Edison, Piquemal said. EDF will get nearly 8 gigawatts of
generation capacity in Edison while Edipower has about 7
gigawatts including 2 gigawatts on sites that will be be closed,
he said. </p>
<p>Edison will sign a contract to supply a minimum of 50
percent of Edipower''s gas for six years, EDF said. </p>
<p>Edison has a market value of about 4.3 billion euros. In
October, the company reported a 93 million euro loss because of
gas contracts, writedowns and higher taxes. Net debt as of Sept.
30 was 4.1 billion euros, up from 3.7 billion euros at the end
of 2010. </p>

<p>Mu Sigma, a company that helps
businesses make decisions by analyzing data, attracted a $108
million investment, the largest round of private-equity
financing in the analytic-services industry. </p>
<p>The funding was led by General Atlantic LLC and followed a
$25 million round in April, Northbrook, Illinois-based Mu Sigma
said today in a statement. Sequoia Capital led the earlier
investment and participated in the new round, raising its stake
in Mu Sigma, according to the statement. </p>
<p>Mu Sigma will use the capital to add 600 to 700 employees
to its 1,500 within the next year, said Dhiraj Rajaram, chairman
and chief executive officer of Mu Sigma. </p>
<p>The whole area of big data and data analytics and

Pat Hedley, a managing director at General Atlantic, based in
Greenwich, Connecticut, said in an interview. ''''Mu Sigma has a
great client base and a strong management team. </p>
<p>The deal is the largest investment on record by a private-
equity or venture-capital firm in the data-processing and
enterprise-software services industries, according to data

$94 million investment earlier this year in Six Degrees

<p>LVMH Sues Over Use of Fake Vuitton Luggage in Hangover'' Film </p>
<p>LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) sued Time Warner Inc. (TWX)''s
Warner Brothers Entertainment unit for trademark infringement. </p>
<p>The suit, filed Dec. 22 in federal court in New York, is
related to Warner''s The Hangover: Part II movie. The French
luxury-goods maker claims that a travel bag used in the film and
referred to as a genuine piece of Louis Vuitton luggage is a
fake. </p>
<p>By referring to the fake as a Louis Vuitton bag, Warner
Brothers is explicitly misleading the public about the
source of the counterfeit product, Vuitton said in its
pleadings. While the fake uses the color scheme of genuine
Vuitton bags, it lacks the LV trademark, the company said in its
pleadings. </p>
<p>The bag used in the movie is actually from a company
against which Vuitton brought an action before the U.S.
International Trade Commission, a body with the power to ban the
import of infringing items, the luxury-goods company said. </p>
<p>Vuitton does authorize product placement in movies, only
with its permission and only with genuine products, according to
court papers. Warner is accused of stepping outside the general
practice in the movie industry of clearing the use of a branded
product with the brand owner. </p>
<p>In addition to seeking an order barring the advertising,
promotion and distribution of the film containing any scenes
with the allegedly infringing bag, Vuitton asked the court to
order the destruction of all copies of the film that contain
images of the counterfeit bag and represent it as a genuine
Louis Vuitton product. </p>
<p>Additionally, Vuitton asked for an award of Warner
Brother''s profits related to its alleged false designation or
origin, money damages, litigation costs and attorney fees. </p>
<p>This isn''t the first time the film has been the target of
an infringement suit. In April, the tattoo artist who created
Mike Tyson''s distinctive tattoo sued over the use of that design
in the film. That case settled in June for undisclosed terms. </p>
<p>That case was Whitmill v. Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.,
4:11-cv-00752-DCP, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Missouri (St. Louis). </p>
<p>In the new case, Vuitton is represented by Theodore C. Max
of Los Angeles-based Sheppard Mullin Richter  Hampton LLP (1215L), and
Robert E. Shapiro, Wendi E. Sloane and Vito S. Solitro of
Chicago''s Barack Ferrazzano Kirschbaum  Nagelberg LLP. </p>
<p>The case is Louis Vuitton Malletier SA v. Warner Bros.
Entertainment Inc., 1:11-cv-09436-ALC, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<p>Japanese Police Say China Source of Most Counterfeit Goods </p>
<p>Japan''s National Police Agency has identified almost 450
websites advertising in the Japanese language counterfeit
fashion items such as handbags, with most of them originating in
China, the Mainichi Daily News reported. </p>
<p>Most of the sites use such phrases as It''s a super copy -
- looks just like the original, according to the newspaper. </p>
<p>While the police have shut down 28 websites in Japan, 14 of
them reappeared soon after having changed from domestic servers
to overseas, the newspaper reported. </p>
<p>Before 2006, most of the fake fashion items originated in
Korea. China now leads, producing 92 percent of all seized
counterfeit items in 2010, according to Mainichi News. </p>

<p>Singapore Press Says Yahoo! Deliberately'' Committed Plagiarism </p>
<p>Singapore Press Holdings Ltd. (SPH), embroiled in a legal tussle
with Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) as both accused each other of copyright
infringement, said the Internet company deliberately
reproduced its news content without permission. </p>
<p>Yahoo had over an extended period of time consistently
and deliberately committed plagiarism by substantially
reproducing the words and expressions used in SPH''s articles
without permission, Singapore Press said in a statement to the
stock exchange yesterday. Yahoo was free-riding on the
newspaper publisher to boost its website page views and
advertising revenue, according to the statement. </p>
<p>Singapore Press sued Yahoo''s Southeast Asia unit Nov. 18,
claiming the company reproduced 23 articles from newspapers
including the Straits Times from November 2010 to October 2011
without authorization. On Dec. 13, Yahoo denied breaching
copyright laws and counter-sued Singapore Press for wrongly
using its images and articles on a website. </p>
<p>SPH is determined to pursue this suit vigorously and to
protect its copyrighted works, the newspaper publisher said
after filing its defense to the Singapore High Court yesterday
in response to Yahoo''s countersuit. </p>
<p>Yahoo said in a defense filed to the Singapore court Dec.
13 the articles that Singapore Press claimed were reproduced
without authorization were insubstantial and insignificant. </p>
<p>There is an important public interest in respect of the
right of the public to be informed of current events in
Singapore, the Sunnyvale, California-based Internet company
said. Copyright law does not protect facts and information. </p>
<p>Yahoo approached Singapore Press in April 2009 for a
license to reproduce news content, and negotiations between the
two companies broke down last year, according to the publisher''s
lawsuit. The Internet company relied on Singapore Press''s
articles to provide content on its website to raise traffic and
build readership without having to expend financial resources,
according to the lawsuit. </p>
<p>These acts of infringement were committed by Yahoo to
direct and maximize traffic to its website in order to drive up
its page views and advertising revenue, Singapore Press said
today. This was not done for the public interest, as claimed
by Yahoo, but instead in furtherance of its own vested financial
interest. </p>
<p>Singapore Press deliberately kept silent until a letter
from its lawyers Nov. 4, causing Yahoo to continue with the
alleged infringement for a year as it believed the publisher had
no complaints, according to the Internet company''s filing. </p>
<p>The case is Singapore Press Holdings Ltd. v Yahoo!
Southeast Asia Ltd., S831/2011, Singapore High Court. </p>
<p>Japanese Court Upholds Acquittal of Software Developer </p>
<p>Japan''s highest court upheld a lower court''s ruling
clearing the developer of the Winny file-sharing software of
enabling criminal copyright infringement, the Mainichi News
reported. </p>
<p>The court said the users are the ones who decide whether to
use the program legally or illegally, according to the
newspaper. </p>
<p>Isamu Kaneko, 41, was first accused of aiding criminal
infringement in 2003 and was found guilty in 2006 and fined 1.5
million yen ($13,000), Mainichi News reported. The guilty
verdict was reversed by an intermediate court. </p>
<p>Kaneko''s case was the first in Japan to test the liability
of a software developer for illegal use of the file-sharing
software he created, according to Mainichi News. </p>
<p>Korean Music Companies Win Damages in U.S. Court Against Aussie </p>
<p>A federal court in San Jose, California, entered a $645,000
judgment against an Australian defendant in a copyright
infringement suit brought by a group of Korean music companies. </p>
<p>Six Korean music companies sued Kenny Tran, the operator of
the 1honeyjoo.com and 1honedew.com websites, for copyright
infringement in March 2011. </p>
<p>They accused Tran, an Australian defendant, of operating
websites to disseminate unauthorized copies of their music,
calling him one of the biggest illegal uploaders and free
download link providers of Korean music in the world. </p>
<p>They filed court documents in March attesting that Tran had
properly been served with a copy of the complaint. Tran has
never responded to the filing, according to the case docket. </p>
<p>In her order granting the music companies a default
judgment against Tran, U.S. District Judge Lucy H. Koh addressed
the issue of whether her court was an appropriate forum for a
dispute between the two foreign defendants. </p>
<p>She said that Tran used California companies -- including
Facebook Inc., Google Inc.''s YouTube and Twitter Inc. -- to
advertise and direct people to his websites, and that his sites
encouraged Californians to download music without authorization.
She also noted that Tran had failed to come forward and ask for
an alternative forum. </p>
<p>She found her court to be appropriate and issued a
permanent order barring Tran from further infringement of the
companies'' copyrights, and awarded the companies the $645,000 in
damages they requested. </p>
<p>The case is DFSB Kollective Vo. Ltd. v. Tran, 5:11-
cv-01049-LHK, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
California (San Jose). </p>
<p>Bahamas Copyright Fund to Get Royalty-Payout Regulations </p>
<p>While the Bahamas Copyright Royalty Fund hasn''t paid
performers any royalties in its 11 years of existence, the
situation is about to change with the establishment of
regulations governing payment rates, the Bahamas Tribune
newspaper reported. </p>
<p>The Bahamas Attorney General''s Office has appointed an IP
specialist to develop the regulations and rates so the Copyright
Royalties Tribunal could begin to make payments from the fund,
according to the Tribune. </p>
<p>The fund was established in 2000 to provide payments to
television performers and artists by Cable Bahamas, the
newspaper reported. </p>
<p>The London-based Performing Rights Society for Music, which
represents Bahamian music creators and rights holders, sent the
chairman of the tribunal a letter raising concerns about the
lack of payouts from the fund, according to the Tribune. </p>

<p>Trade Secrets </p>
<p>Synthes Accuses Stryker of Raiding California Sales Force </p>
<p>A unit of Synthes Inc., the world''s largest maker of bone-
related medical devices, accused Stryker Corp. in a lawsuit of
raiding its San Francisco sales force and using confidential
information from former employees. </p>
<p>Stryker seeks to obtain an improper competitive
advantage in the industry for medical implants and instruments
used in spinal surgery, Synthes USA Sales LLC said in the
complaint filed yesterday in federal court in Philadelphia.
Synthes also accused three former sales employees of
misappropriating trade secrets and breaching their contractual
and fiduciary obligations to the company. </p>
<p>The former employees resigned from Synthes from August to
early October, according to the complaint. They immediately
began working for Stryker, one of the company''s direct
competitors, and are soliciting former customers, according to
the court filing. </p>
<p>Representatives of Kalamazoo, Michigan-based Stryker didn''t
immediately respond to an e-mail and phone message at the
company headquarters seeking comment on the lawsuit. </p>
<p>Even though all three employees live and work in
California, the suit alleged the three ex-employees violated
Pennsylvania trade-secrets law rather than California''s. Courts
in California have tended to look less kindly than those in
other states on employment contracts that limit future
employment in the same industry. </p>
<p>Johnson  Johnson agreed to buy Synthes, based in West
Chester, Pennsylvania, in April for $21.3 billion to become the
leader in the $5.5 billion market for devices to treat trauma
victims. </p>
<p>The case is Synthes USA Sales LLC v. Stryker Corp., 2:11-
cv-07876-TJS, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Pennsylvania (Philadelphia). </p>

years ago, the agency said today in a statement. </p>
<p>The FDA weighed approval on the condition New York-based
Pfizer studies the vaccine further to prove it protects against
pneumococcal pneumonia. About 300,000 U.S. adults 50 and older
are hospitalized with the infections each year, said Karen Midthun, director of FDA''s Center for Biologics Evaluation and
Research. </p>
<p>Pneumococcal disease is a substantial cause of illness
and death, Midthun said in the statement. Today''s approval
provides an additional vaccine for preventing pneumococcal
pneumonia and invasive disease in this age group. </p>
<p>Prevnar 13, approved in the U.S. last year for children 6
weeks to 5 years old, generated (PFE) $2.82 billion the first nine
months of 2011, according to the regulatory filings from Pfizer,
the world''s biggest drugmaker. The vaccine may generate $5.9
billion by 2015, with adult use contributing $1.8 billion, said
Catherine Arnold, an analyst with Credit Suisse Group AG in New
York, in a note to investors. </p>
<p>The FDA approval of Prevnar 13 for these adults offers
the potential to contribute to the health of millions of aging
Americans, Ian Read, Pfizer''s chairman and chief executive
officer, said today in an e-mail. </p>
<p>Safety Results </p>
<p>An FDA staff report released Nov. 14 determined the vaccine
was safe and effective in adults who received Pneumovax 23 from
Whitehouse Station, New Jersey-based Merck and in those never
immunized. Pfizer started an 85,000-subject trial in the
Netherlands to confirm the vaccine''s effectiveness in staving
off pneumococcal pneumonia, the agency said today. </p>
<p>Pfizer hasn''t determined how long the shot will last and is
studying a five-year duration as part of the Netherlands trial,
said Peter Paradiso, of Pfizer''s vaccine development unit, in an
interview. </p>
<p>Pfizer declined less than 1 percent to $21.64 at the close
in New York. The shares gained 24 percent this year. </p>
<p>Merck''s Pneumovax 23 had $276 million in sales (MRK) in the first
nine months of this year, according to company filings. </p>
<p>Insurance coverage for Prevnar 13 will depend on whether
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention''s vaccines panel
recommends Pfizer''s shot for those 50 and older. The 2010 health
law requires coverage of vaccines recommended by the panel
without a co-payment or deductible cost to patients. </p>
<p>Merck''s vaccine is recommended for people 65 and older and
for people 2 years and older at high risk for pneumonia, such as
those with sickle cell disease, HIV infection and other
conditions that compromise the immune system, according to the
CDC. It is also recommended for adults 19 to 64 who smoke, have
asthma or live in nursing homes or long-term care facilities. </p>

<p>Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) must pay
about $750 million to Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), a tenth of what the
U.S. company is seeking, for assets nationalized by Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez in 2007, according to two people with
knowledge of the case. </p>
<p>The International Chamber of Commerce in New York, an
international arbitration court, gave a favorable ruling to
Venezuela''s state oil company, a company spokesman said today.
The World Bank''s International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes, or ICSID, is also due to rule on the claim
in a suit filed against the Venezuelan government. </p>
<p>The people, who declined to be identified because they''re
not authorized to speak about the case publicly, said the
decision was handed down late this month. </p>
<p>Chavez, who has nationalized assets in the energy, metals,
cement and telecommunications industries, faces about 20
arbitration cases at the ICSID, according to the Washington-
based center''s website. Venezuelan Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez
said in September that the country was willing to pay Exxon $1
billion after Carlos Escarra, the country''s prosecutor general,
told reporters that the two companies were negotiating a
settlement of about $6 billion. </p>
