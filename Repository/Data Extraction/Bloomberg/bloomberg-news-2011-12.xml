&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) needs to &#8220;come into
line&#8221; with Brazil&#8217;s laws, and the country is studying if the
San Ramon, California-based producer will be able to compete for
new exploration licenses after causing an oil spill, the
country&#8217;s oil minister said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil producer after Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM), needs to comply with the country&#8217;s laws and
coordinate activities with the country&#8217;s oil regulator, Minister
Edison Lobao said in an interview in Brasilia today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil plans to offer exploration areas by the end of 2012
in the so-called pre-salt region in deep waters of the Atlantic
Ocean. Brazil has made the largest oil discoveries in the
Americas in more than three decades in the area, where oil
deposits of up to four miles below the ocean floor are trapped
under a layer of salt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron &#8220;needs to completely come into line with Brazilian
law,&#8221; Lobao said. &#8220;From time to time there are gaps of
information between them and the agency.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron has come under increased scrutiny in Brazil after
it leaked 2,400 barrels of oil last month from an oil field in
deep waters of the Campos Basin. Chevron underestimated the
amount of pressure at an oil deposit it was exploring, and crude
leaked from the reservoir for about eight days, George Buck, the
head of Chevron for Brazil, said on Nov. 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigations &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s oil regulator, known as ANP, is investigating
Chevron for only providing partial video clips of the Nov. 7 oil
spill and not reporting the presence of hydrogen sulfide in an
oil well at the Frade project where the spill happened, Magda Chambriard, a director at the agency, said Dec. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency ordered Chevron to shut the well with hydrogen
sulfide and is also investigating inconsistencies in Chevron&#8217;s
plan to cement and abandon the well that caused the leak, she
said. The agency has prohibited Chevron from drilling any new
wells for at least three months until it finishes probing the
spill, Chambriard said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Not even one drop has reached the beach; a reaction of
this magnitudes is really surprising,&#8221; Ali Moshiri, the head of
Chevron&#8217;s operations in Latin America and Africa, said in an
interview on Nov. 29. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well Chevron shut accounts for less than 10 percent of
output at Frade, the company said in a statement Dec. 1. Frade
was Brazil&#8217;s eighth largest producing field in September with
80,425 barrels a day of oil and natural gas production,
according to information on the ANP&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drilling Ban &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Output at Frade will decline if the drilling ban lasts
longer than expected and Chevron is unable to drill new wells to
produce oil and inject water, a process that maintains pressure
and output levels at the reservoir, said William Edwards,
president of Houston-based Edwards Energy Consultants. Other oil
companies will study the government&#8217;s response to the Chevron
spill before investing in oil exploration, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The way it&#8217;s handled causes people to think about if
they&#8217;re going to put their money in,&#8221; Edwards said in a
telephone interview from Houston. &#8220;When you think about the
complexity of what they are doing, to think that anybody can
prevent anything from going wrong is dreaming.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron halted the source of the leak more than 20 days ago
and only residual droplets are seeping to the surface, Scott Walker, a Chevron spokesman, said yesterday in an e-mailed
statement. The company abides by the government&#8217;s decisions and
fully informs its agencies, Walker said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron has completed the second phase of cementing the
well that caused the spill, and the amount of oil on the surface
of the ocean has been reduced to less than a barrel of oil,
Walker said in an e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron rose 1 percent to $102.82 at the close in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s advanced kidney cancer
treatment may not be effective at prolonging the time some
patients live without the disease getting worse, a Food and Drug
Administration staff report said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA said it was concerned that the number of U.S.
patients who benefited from the therapy, chemically known as
axitinib, was small. People who showed the most response were
first treated with medicines known as cytokines, which are not
used as much as newer treatments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Advice is sought on whether the issue of&#8221; survival free
from disease progression is &#8220;being driven by a subset of
patients that is likely to be scarce in the United States,&#8221;
according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medicine from New York-based Pfizer, the world&#8217;s
biggest drugmaker, may compete with tivozanib from Aveo
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (AVEO) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which is also
being tested to treat advanced kidney cancer. Both block
receptors in the body thought to play a role in spreading
tumors. Kidney cancer affects 296,000 people in the U.S.,
according to the American Cancer Society. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An advisory panel is scheduled to meet on axitinib Dec. 7
and make recommendations to the agency on the risks and benefits
of the treatment. The FDA isn&#8217;t required to follow the panel&#8217;s
advice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer fell less than 1 percent to $19.84 at the close in
New York. The shares have gained 13 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than a third of patients in the trial had received
cytokines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kidney Cancer Treatments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typical kidney cancer treatments, according to the National
Institutes of Health, include surgery to remove part of all of
the kidney, radiation, chemotherapy and other drugs such as
Bayer AG (BAYN)&#8217;s Nexavar. Pfizer compared axitinib to Nexavar, which
the FDA approved in 2005, in its final-phase clinical trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results &#8220;indicate that axitinib has demonstrated a
statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement
in efficacy&#8221; compared with Nexavar, Pfizer said in the report
that it will present to the advisory panel Dec. 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial found axitinib kept the disease from progressing
for a median of 6.7 months compared with 4.7 months for Nexavar,
according to results released in June. The study included 723
patients. The FDA is expected to decide whether to approve
Pfizer&#8217;s drug by March 13. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s main opposition called for an
all-party meeting to end parliamentary gridlock over Prime
Minister Manmohan Singh&#8217;s decision last month to allow Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. (WMT) and other foreign companies to own supermarkets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bharatiya Janata Party&#8217;s spokesman Ravi Shankar Prasad
said yesterday that the government must inform all parties of
its latest position amid claims by Singh&#8217;s biggest ally on Dec.
3 that the policy had been suspended. Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee told reporters separately yesterday in New Delhi that
he will make a statement in parliament when it reconvenes
tomorrow after a two-day break. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logjam has sparked concern Singh will cave in to the
opposition&#8217;s demands and imperil a plan that his government says
will attract foreign investment and check inflation above the
central bank&#8217;s comfort zone. The government may delay allowing
overseas companies to control retailers because of opposition
from its allies to the new rules, two finance ministry officials
with direct knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If that is official, then it is a tactical retreat by the
government,&#8221; said G.V.L. Narasimha Rao, managing director of
New Delhi-based Development  Research Services. &#8220;It will keep
the implementation on hold and will wait for an opportune moment
to push it forward again.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trinamool Congress, an ally in Singh&#8217;s coalition government
and which opposes the easing of ownership rules in retail, has
&#8220;issues&#8221; with and will oppose foreign investment in airlines
and the pension industry as well, spokesman Derek O&#8217;Brien said
in an interview on the CNBC-TV18 network yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pending Bills &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nine days of protests in parliament over the policy have
forced repeated adjournments in the winter session that started
Nov. 22. About 31 bills are waiting to be passed, including
legislation to create an anti-corruption agency with powers to
prosecute government officials. Last year&#8217;s winter sitting was
the least productive in 25 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traders shut their shops across India on Dec. 1 in a
daylong strike, demanding the government scrap a proposal that
they say will force the closure of millions of small businesses.
Foreign investment will create as many as 10 million jobs and
curb inflation, Trade Minister Anand Sharma, said Nov. 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trinamool, which rules the state of West Bengal, said on
its website Dec. 3 that the government has suspended its
decision until there&#8217;s a consensus among all parties, citing a
conversation between its chief Mamata Banerjee and Mukherjee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The delay in the policy triggered a slump in the shares of
retailers in Mumbai yesterday. Pantaloon Retail India Ltd. (PF), the
country&#8217;s largest chain by market value, tumbled 12.9 percent,
the most since May 2002, to 186.35 rupees. Trent Ltd. (TRENT) fell 3.3
percent to 962.50 rupees, while Vishal Retail Ltd. (VISH) slid 6
percent to 18.90 rupees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Policy Inertia&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They are getting hammered as the government is likely to
withdraw or defer the proposal,&#8221; said R.K. Gupta, the New
Delhi-based managing director of Taurus Asset Management Ltd.,
which manages $1.1 billion. &#8220;This policy inertia may have a
negative impact as foreign investors will lose confidence in the
government.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to kick start an economy that expanded at the
slowest pace in two years in the quarter ended Sept. 30, Singh
approved overseas companies including Carrefour SA (CA) and Tesco Plc (TSCO)
to own as much as 51 percent of retailers selling more than one
brand, adding riders to benefit the local economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singh, besieged by opposition over his failure to check
inflation and allegations of graft in his administration, is
also trying to fend off criticism that decisions have stalled on
his watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not Unusual &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross domestic product grew 6.9 percent last quarter, while
benchmark inflation stayed above 9 percent all of this year even
after 13 interest-rate increases since March 2010. The rupee has
slid 13.1 percent this year, the worst performance in Asia, as
overseas funds turned net sellers of equities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the entry of the foreign chains, India&#8217;s retail
industry may gain $8 billion to $10 billion in investment in the
next five to 10 years as local companies try to keep pace,
according to Kishore Biyani, founder and managing director of
Pantaloon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s Investors Service said the initiatives are &#8220;credit
positive&#8221; and will &#8220;incentivize foreign investment in India.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Such opposition is neither unusual nor unexpected in
Indian politics,&#8221; Atsi Sheth, a New York-based sovereign-risk
analyst at Moody&#8217;s, said in a statement yesterday. &#8220;It appears
that the ruling coalition is firm in its commitment, which bodes
well for its eventual implementation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gulf Coast gasoline weakened after
Exxon Mobil Corp. resumed normal operations at the Beaumont
refinery in Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plant shut a compressor and expected &#8220;some impact to
production,&#8221; the company said in a Dec. 1 filing with state
regulators. Rachael Moore, a company spokeswoman, declined to
identify equipment returning to service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast widened 0.25 cent to 6 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 12:38 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose
1.33 cents to $2.572 a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same fuel in New York Harbor held at a premium of 4.25

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest bank-
card network, agreed to help develop Rwanda&#8217;s payments system
and connect the African nation&#8217;s 11 million citizens to the
global economy as the firm pushes to boost non-U.S. revenue. (V) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will modernize the nation&#8217;s payments network
under an accord with the government, working with partners to
upgrade automated teller machines, install merchant card
readers, develop e-commerce capabilities and provide financial
education, said Elizabeth Buse, Visa&#8217;s group president
responsible for most business outside the Americas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s absolutely critical that you start with the
government if you are going to have the full pyramid of payments
services,&#8221; Buse, 50, said in a phone interview. &#8220;Our intent is
to take what we are doing in Rwanda and repeat it across&#8221; other
developing economies, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project may help Chief Executive Officer Joseph W. Saunders, 66, fulfill his goal of generating more than half of
Visa&#8217;s revenue outside the U.S. by 2015. Last month, the company
announced a plan to create prepaid accounts linked to mobile
phones across Africa and the Middle East as it aims to capture
transactions from so-called unbanked consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa chose Rwanda, where 86 percent of the population lacks
access to traditional financial services, because of its
friendliness toward private enterprise, stable regulatory
structure and smaller population, Buse said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The liquidator of Bernard L. Madoff&#8217;s
firm, who lost the right to demand $19 billion in damages from
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), appealed the ruling to a higher court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan last month won the dismissal of trustee Irving Picard&#8217;s damage claims in his lawsuit alleging the biggest U.S.
bank aided Madoff&#8217;s fraud. Picard can&#8217;t sue for common-law
damages on behalf of the defunct Madoff firm&#8217;s customers, U.S.
District Judge Colleen McMahon ruled in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge told Picard he could go ahead and appeal her
ruling after getting JPMorgan&#8217;s consent to do so, according to
court papers. Picard agreed to put his remaining claims against
New York-based JPMorgan on hold while he appeals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rulings by district judges McMahon and Jed Rakoff have
knocked more than $28 billion off of Picard&#8217;s claims against
banks and may cost him as much as $11 billion in recoveries from
other cases aimed at benefiting investors who lost money in the
Ponzi scheme, according to the trustee&#8217;s estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it didn&#8217;t know about the fraud and couldn&#8217;t
be held responsible for a scheme orchestrated by Madoff alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff pleaded guilty and is serving a 150-year prison
term. Picard and his firm have made about $224 million in fees
since Madoff&#8217;s 2008 arrest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The McMahon cases are Picard v. JPMorgan Chase  Co., 11-
cv-913; Picard v. UBS Fund Services (Luxembourg) SA, 11-cv-4212,

&lt;p&gt;European Union governments may see
the bloc&#8217;s carbon market as a way to raise cash, said Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The EU emissions trading system could offer another
opportunity for governments across Europe to raise funds, and at
the same time bolster their own green credentials,&#8221; Fred Barasi, an analyst in London, said yesterday in an e-mailed
research note. The nations, struggling financially, may regard
the carbon market as a &#8220;cash cow&#8221; after raising taxes from
utilities for climate protection the past 18 months, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon permits for December have plunged 48 percent this
year and fell 4.4 percent today to 7.47 euros ($10.04) a metric
ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London as of 1:37 p.m.
Increased supply of offset credits and the proposed first sales
of 2013 EU carbon allowances have helped drive prices lower, as
has muted demand because of slow economic production during the
bloc&#8217;s sovereign-debt crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU carbon permits may rebound to 15 euros a metric ton by
2013, Barasi said. That&#8217;s 40 percent less than an earlier
forecast, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. has set a precedent for intervening in the market
when it announced a price floor in March, Goldman Sachs said.
&#8220;The level at which the U.K. carbon price floor will start, 16
pounds ($25) a ton in 2013, is currently more than double the
forward-market price of 7.50 pounds.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. Treasury estimates it will raise 740 million
pounds from the power sector in 2013 through the measure, rising
to 1.41 billion pounds by 2015, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Dec. 2, the European Commission, the Brussels-based
regulator of the EU market, delivered 300 million tons of phase
three allowances to the European Investment Bank, which need to
be sold by Oct. 2. The third phase of the greenhouse-gas program
starts in 2013 and runs through 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU governments might agree to temporarily &#8220;set aside&#8221;
some allowances to boost prices and create a shortage around
2014, earlier than expected, Barasi said. Current rules would
create a shortage around 2017, he said. The bloc may
alternatively tighten its 2020 emissions target or introduce a
carbon floor price to boost prices, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s Wyeth unit and Teva
Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. were accused by a group of prescription
drug retailers of illegally keeping a generic version of the
Effexor XR antidepressant off the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Wyeth engaged in an overarching anticompetitive scheme to
prevent and delay the approval and marketing of generic versions
of Effexor XR,&#8221; the retailers, including Walgreen Co. (WAG) and
Kroger Co. (KR), said in a complaint filed Nov. 30 in federal court
in Trenton, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The retailers allege that Wyeth fraudulently obtained
patents and engaged in &#8220;sham litigation&#8221; to delay generic
versions of the extended release drug. They also alleged that
Wyeth and the U.S. unit of Israel-based Teva Pharmaceuticals
Industries Ltd. colluded to keep Teva (TEVA)&#8217;s generic version off the
market until June 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joan Campion, a spokeswoman for New York-based Pfizer, and
Denise Bradley, a spokeswoman for Teva North America, didn&#8217;t
immediately return calls seeking comment on the lawsuit after
regular business hours Dec. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Walgreen v. Wyeth, 11-6985, U.S. District
Court, District of New Jersey (Trenton). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research Affiliates Sues WisdomTree Over Portfolio Patents &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research Affiliates LLC, the asset-management company, sued
WisdomTree Investments Inc. for allegedly infringing three of
its patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patents include a method for using accounting-data-
based indexing to create a portfolio of assets, Newport Beach,
California-based Research Affiliates said in a complaint filed
Dec. 1 in federal court in Santa Ana, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our main focus is product quality and performance, but we
will protect our intellectual property and the interests of our
business partners when our patents are infringed,&#8221; Research
Affiliates&#8217; Chairman Rob Arnott said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research Affiliates, a closely held company majority owned
by its employees, said $78 billion in assets are managed using
investment strategies it developed. The company told WisdomTree
in 2005 that it was applying for one of the patents at issue,
according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WisdomTree responded by saying that Research Affiliates&#8217;
intellectual property rights were &#8220;speculative at best&#8221; and
that WisdomTree was submitting prior public information about
inventions related to the proposed patent to the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office, according to the complaint. The office issued
the patent to Research Affiliates, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stuart Bell, a spokesman for New York-based WisdomTree,
didn&#8217;t respond to messages seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial products that Research Affiliates claims infringe
its patents include WisdomTree Dividend Index and WisdomTree
Earnings Index. Research Affiliates is seeking a jury trial and
a court order to stop WisdomTree from using the methods alleged
to be patented. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple &#8216;Occupy&#8217; Trademark Applications Filed at USPTO &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;Occupy&#8221; movement has spawned more than 25 different
applications to register trademarks containing various
permutations of the name in such phrases as &#8220;Occupy Wall
Street,&#8221; according to the database of the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the most recent applications are one filed Nov. 22 to
register &#8220;Occupy Los Angeles&#8221; for use with &#8220;political action
committee services.&#8221; The applicant lists only a general-
delivery address in Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that same date, Kop-N-Go Inc. of New York filed an
application to register &#8220;Occupy Hip Hop&#8221; tor use with hats,
sweatshirts and t-shirts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A resident of Bloomington, California, filed an application
that day to register &#8220;Occupy Any Wear&#8221; for use on clothing.
ERB  Sons LLC of Los Angeles filed an application Nov. 21 to
register &#8220;Occupy America&#8221; to be used on long and short-sleeved
t-shirts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Occupy the Outdoors&#8221; is a trademark sought by Whitetail
Institute of North America Inc. The Pintlala, Alabama-based
company, which filed its application Nov. 17, appears from its
website to be a producer of seeds for food plants intended to
attract deer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mark containing &#8220;Occupy the Dance Floor&#8221; is sought by a
resident of Baltimore, Maryland. He says in his application --
filed Nov. 15 -- that it will be used for T-shirts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other pending applications are to register &#8220;Occupy Las
Vegas,&#8221; &#8220;Occupy the Vote 2012,&#8221; &#8220;Occupy Together,&#8221; and
&#8220;Occupy as One.&#8221; There is also an application, filed Oct. 19
by a resident of Powell, Ohio, to register &#8220;Everywhere I Go I
Occupy&#8221; as a mark, also to be used on t-shirts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob Marley&#8217;s Family Sues Performer&#8217;s Half Brother for Infringing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holders of the intellectual property rights related to
the Reggae singer Bob Marley sued the late performer&#8217;s half
brother for trademark infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit, filed Dec. 1 in federal court in Ft. Lauderdale,
Florida, is related Richard Booker&#8217;s applications to register
&#8220;Mama Marley&#8221; and &#8220;Nine Mile&#8221; as trademarks in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to court papers, Booker operates a restaurant in
Jamaica named &#8220;Mama Marley&#8217;s&#8221; and conducts tours of the Nine
Mile region of Jamaica, a region of the island country
associated with the late singer and where he is buried. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IP rights holders also complain that Booker has
advertised his restaurant in the U.S. and operates the Nine Mile
Music Festival and the &#8220;www.bobmarleymovement.com&#8221; website
they say infringe their marks. They claim that to no avail they
engaged in &#8220;extensive settlement talks&#8221; with Booker over his
use of the name and likeness of the late performer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rights holders -- Marley&#8217;s widow and nine of his 11
children -- asked the court to bar further trademark
infringement by Booker, and for an order cancelling Booker&#8217;s &#8220;9
Mile Music&#8221; trademark and barring the registration of several
pending trademark applications. Additionally, they seek awards
of money damages, attorney fees and litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are represented by Bruce G. Hermelee of Hermelee 
Geffin LLC of Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Fifty-Six Hope Road Music Ltd. v. Richard
Booker, 1:11-cv-24326-MGC, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of Florida (Ft. Lauderdale). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti-Piracy Group BREIN Accused by Composer of Infringing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bescherming Rechten Entertainment Industrie Nederland, the
Dutch anti-piracy group known as BREIN, has itself been accused
of copyright infringement by a musician who said the group is
using his work without permission, the anti-copyright Torrent
Freak website reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melchior Rietveldt was asked by BREIN to compose music for
an anti-piracy video to be shown at a local music festival, and
is now objecting to its use by the organization in other
contexts, according to Torrent Freak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He found his music included in an anti-piracy message
embedded in a DVD of one of the Harry Potter films, Torrent
Freak reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The composer is seeking at least 1 million Euros ($1.4
million) in compensation for what he says is unauthorized use of
his work, according to Torrent Freak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers Float Alternative to Google-Opposed Online Piracy Bill &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. lawmakers are circulating an alternative approach to
Hollywood-backed anti-piracy legislation after Internet
companies including Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. objected to
the bills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the draft proposal from a bipartisan group of Senate
and House members, U.S. intellectual-property holders could
petition the U.S. International Trade Commission to investigate
foreign websites accused of trafficking in pirated content and
counterfeit goods. The commission is an independent agency set
up to protect U.S. markets from unfair trade practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re going to be able to handcuff the bad actors that
are selling fake movies and Viagra,&#8221; Senator Ron Wyden, an
Oregon Democrat who helped draft the proposal, said in an
interview Dec. 1. &#8220;This is a model that gets us a chance to go
after them without doing so much damage to the architecture of
the Internet.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti-piracy bills in the House and Senate have pitted the
nation&#8217;s biggest Internet companies against the U.S. film and
music industries, which want the government to do more to halt
the online sale of goods such as knockoff watches and illegally
copied music. Web companies say the proposed legislation would
require them to police the Internet, undermining the growth of
the U.S. technology industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House bill would let the U.S. attorney general seek
court orders requiring U.S. Internet-service providers, search
engines, payment processors and ad networks to block or cease
business with websites linked to online piracy. The measure,
introduced in October by House Judiciary Committee Chairman
Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican, also would give intellectual-
property holders ways to compel payment and ad services to sever
ties with such websites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate Judiciary Committee approved in May a similar
bill, S. 968, known as the Protect IP Act. Both the House and
Senate measures have multiple co-sponsors from both parties.
Wyden has threatened to block the Protect IP Act from reaching a
vote in the full Senate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the alternative proposal, the International Trade
Commission would be authorized to issue cease-and-desist orders
against foreign websites that could be used to force payment
processors, such as Visa Inc. or PayPal Inc., and online
advertising networks to cease providing services to such
websites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade agency has the power to block imports of products
found to infringe intellectual property rights, can propose
tariffs on products to counter subsidized imports and
investigates trade-related issues for Congress and the
president. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyden said the group intends to circulate the draft and
request feedback, and introduce legislation in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alternative proposal was signed by 10 lawmakers from
both parties, including Democratic Senators Maria Cantwell of
Washington and Mark Warner of Virginia; Republican
Representatives Darrell Issa of California and Jason Chaffetz of
Utah; and Democratic Representatives Anna Eshoo and Zoe Lofgren
of California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House bill is H.R. 3261. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorado Holds Hearing on Fracking Formula Trade Secrets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorado&#8217;s oil company regulators are to hear testimony
today about the confidentiality of formulas for fluids used to
fracture underground rock structures in the search for oil, the
Coloradoan reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governor John Hickenlooper has proposed a new rule that
would mandate disclosure of chemicals used for hydraulic
fracturing, or &#8220;fracking,&#8221; which many oil-exploration
companies maintain should be exempted as trade secrets,
according to the Coloradan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some environmental groups contend it&#8217;s vital to disclose
these chemicals as some of them could contaminate drinking
water, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the proposed rule, energy companies would have to
disclose their fracking formulas on a publicly accessible
website, the Coloradoan reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IP Moves &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hogan Lovells Expands China IP Group With Perkins Coie Hire &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hogan Lovells LLP hired William &#8220;Chip&#8221; Fisher for its IP
practice, the Washington-based firm said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fisher, who joins from Seattle&#8217;s Perkins Coie LLP, does
counseling and litigation in the areas of patents, trademarks,
trade secrets and copyrights. He&#8217;s represented clients whose
technologies have included e-commerce systems, electronic
financial transaction systems, network traffic management,
secure data networks, electronic media, and digital rights
management. He has also previously practiced at Schwabe
Williamson  Wyatt PC of Portland, Oregon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is fluent in Mandarin Chinese and will work from the
firm&#8217;s Shanghai office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fisher has an undergraduate degree in Chinese from the
University of Massachusetts, a master&#8217;s degree in criminal
justice from Northeastern University, and a law degree from
Boston University. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ally Financial Inc.&#8217;s GMAC Mortgage
unit stopped buying home loans in Massachusetts after the state
accused the five biggest providers of conducting illegal
foreclosures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Recent developments have led mortgage lending in
Massachusetts to no longer be viable,&#8221; Detroit-based Ally said
in a statement. Ally, owned mostly by the U.S. government after
being bailed out during the 2008 financial crisis, is ranked
fifth this year among the nation&#8217;s mortgage lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley sued Ally and
four other mortgage lenders Dec. 1 for allegedly trying to seize
homes when they didn&#8217;t hold the mortgage on the properties.
Failure to obtain valid mortgage assignments before foreclosure
has affected titles to &#8220;hundreds, if not thousands, of
properties&#8221; in the state, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The company is disappointed that it can no longer
participate in offering certain financing options in
Massachusetts,&#8221; Ally said in its statement. &#8220;However, it has
an obligation to manage risks and deploy capital in an
appropriate manner and in a way that protects the investment of
the U.S. taxpayer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ally will continue making direct loans in the state,
according to Gina Proia, a spokeswoman for Ally. The lender will
honor any commitments through Dec. 5 and continue servicing
existing customers, the statement said. Mortgage servicers send
out and collect bills, and handle foreclosures if borrowers
don&#8217;t pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt Anderson, a spokesman at the U.S. Treasury Department,
which owns 74 percent of Ally, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coakley&#8217;s lawsuit also named Bank of America Corp.,
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo  Co. &lt;/p&gt;

America NA, 11-4363, Suffolk County Superior Court (Boston). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEC&#8217;s Data Crunchers Find Clues Leading to Hedge-Fund Cases &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four hedge-fund fraud cases filed in the past three weeks
by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are the first
products of the agency&#8217;s initiative to build cases on data
analysis instead of outside tips, Bloomberg News&#8217; Jesse Hamilton
reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a system the SEC calls an &#8220;aberrational performance
inquiry,&#8221; analysts use data-mining to scrutinize hedge-fund
returns and other factors. When they identify outliers,
investigators can conduct a further review, the agency said in a
statement Dec. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result the SEC took action against three separate
hedge fund firms and six people in the past month for misconduct
including improper use of fund assets, fraudulent valuations and
misrepresenting fund returns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Hedge-fund managers depend on valuation and performance
for both their compensation and marketing,&#8221; Bruce Karpati, co-
chief of the SEC&#8217;s asset-management enforcement unit, said in an
interview. &#8220;These managers have either manipulated performance
or engaged in other falsehoods in order to line their own
pockets at the expense of investors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The significant thing about these types of analytics is
that we can detect these types of frauds without a complaint or
tip,&#8221; Karpati said. &#8220;So now we&#8217;re able to get to conduct
earlier.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple Wins Extension on Samsung Tablet Ban in Australia &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. won a one-week extension of a ban on Samsung
Electronics Co. (005930)&#8217;s sales of its latest tablet computer in
Australia, delaying pre-Christmas sales, in a battle that began
in April in the U.S. and spread to four continents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High Court Justice John Dyson Heydon extended the ban Dec.
2 on the release of Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy Tab 10.1 to Dec. 9. On that
day, the country&#8217;s top court will consider Apple&#8217;s request for
permission to appeal a lower court&#8217;s order issued earlier this
week, which lifted a ban on the product that has been in place
since mid-October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A stay for one week will cost Samsung, in effect, one
week&#8217;s trade,&#8221; Heydon said, following a 90-minute hearing in
Sydney. The extension will hurt Samsung &#8220;but not to extend the
status quo is likely to be injurious to Apple,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision scuttled Samsung&#8217;s plan to begin importing the
Galaxy Tab 10.1 into Australia over the weekend and take
advantage of the pre-Christmas shopping season. The company had
said if it can&#8217;t sell the tablet in Australia before Christmas
it would scrap its release in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a critical period of time,&#8221; Katrina Howard,
Samsung&#8217;s lawyer, told Heydon Dec. 2. &#8220;Even one day can make a
difference.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The battle between the companies began in April, when Apple
sued Samsung in the U.S. and accused it of &#8220;slavishly&#8221; copying
the designs of iPhones and iPads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeal case is Samsung Electronics Co. v. Apple Inc. (AAPL)
NSD1792/2011. Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia
(Sydney). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Madoff Associate Kohn Has $42 Million Frozen by U.K. Judge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A London judge froze 27 million pounds ($42 million) of
Sonja Kohn&#8217;s assets and ordered the former associate of Bernard
Madoff to move funds to the U.K. as the administrators of
Madoff&#8217;s European operation seek recoveries for victims of his
fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Julian Flaux said Kohn should repatriate as much of
the 27 million pounds as possible to the U.K. within 56 days,
adding it may be at risk as a result of &#8220;the nature of the
wrongful conduct which is alleged against her.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquidators of Madoff&#8217;s estate are pursuing Kohn and the
directors of Madoff Securities International Ltd., the company&#8217;s
English unit, for the return of assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This freezing order is a routine measure for such cases
under English procedures and it is actually a good result in
light of the entire case,&#8221; her lawyer, Clemens Trauttenberg,
said by phone from Vienna. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former chairwoman of Bank Medici AG, according to a
prior ruling from Flaux, made at least $56 million introducing
clients to Madoff, who pleaded guilty in 2009 to using money
from new investors to pay off old ones in a Ponzi scheme,
sparking investigations and dozens of lawsuits. He is serving
150 years in prison in North Carolina for the fraud that caused
his New York-based firm to collapse in December 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kohn, who is suffering from health problems, has a house in
Switzerland and fund investments worth at least 15 million
pounds as well as bank accounts as far away as Israel, lawyers
said Dec. 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Akers, one of the administrators of Madoff Securities
International, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Madoff Securities International Ltd. v. Stephen Ernest John Raven, 10-1468, High Court of Justice, Queen&#8217;s Bench
Division (London) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT, Sprint Sued Over Carrier IQ Tracking Software &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT Inc. (T), Sprint Nextel Corp. (S), Apple Inc. and T-Mobile USA
were sued by mobile phone customers who claim that Carrier IQ
Inc. tracking software installed on their phones violates U.S.
wiretapping and computer fraud laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit cites a YouTube report by a technology blogger
that purported to show that Carrier IQ software collects
information on phone users&#8217; locations, applications and Web
browsing and even the keys they press. Four consumers filed a
complaint Dec. 2 in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware,
seeking to block the carriers and phone makers from using the
software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carrier IQ software logs user activity and runs in the
background of mobile devices. After the YouTube report, the U.S.
Senate Judiciary Committee contacted the company seeking
information and alleging that the software may violate federal
privacy laws, according to a copy of the complaint supplied by
David Straite, an attorney for the plaintiffs. The filing of the
lawsuit couldn&#8217;t be confirmed Dec. 2 through electronic court
records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT and Sprint, the second- and third-largest U.S.
wireless providers, said in e-mailed statements on Dec. 1 that
the software data is used to improve service performance. Apple
stopped supporting Carrier IQ in most products and will remove
it completely in a future software update, Natalie Harrison, an
Apple spokeswoman, said in a Dec. 1 e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The customers who sued seek compensatory and punitive
damages on behalf of all others whose devices contain the so-
called rootkit software from Mountain View, California-based
Carrier IQ, which is also named as a defendant in the suit. The
software is currently installed on 150 million phones worldwide,
according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Violations of the federal wiretap laws, which prohibit
willful interception of wire or electronic communication, can
result in damages of $100 a day per violation, according to the
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carol Roos, a spokeswoman for Dallas-based ATT, declined
to comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom Neumayr, a spokesman for Cupertino, California-based
Apple; Leigh Horner, a spokeswoman for Overland Park, Kansas-
based Sprint Nextel; and T-Mobile USA (DTE) representatives didn&#8217;t
return calls seeking comment after regular business hours on
Dec. 2. Carrier IQ spokeswoman Mira Woods didn&#8217;t respond to an
e-mailed request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Pacilli v. Carrier IQ, U.S. District Court,
District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle Accuses HP of False Advertising in Revised Itanium Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle Corp., accusing Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) of false
advertising in a revised countersuit, said HP secretly paid
Intel Corp. (INTC) to continue producing the Itanium computer chip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle claims HP &#8220;made false and deceptive statements&#8221; to
Oracle and the public regarding the future of the chip to induce
Oracle to continue to build software that runs on HP servers
that use the Itanium chip, according to an amended complaint
provided by Deborah Hellinger, an Oracle spokeswoman. Filing of
the document couldn&#8217;t be immediately confirmed through
electronic state court records Dec. 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HP and Intel had an Itanium collaboration agreement under
which Intel would prolong Itanium instead of discontinuing the
chip, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement was kept secret until Oracle uncovered it in
a lawsuit first filed by HP against Oracle in June. HP alleged
then that Oracle used &#8220;strong arm tactics&#8221; to force customers
to shift away from HP&#8217;s Itanium server hardware to Oracle&#8217;s own
server hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details of the Itanium agreement, such as the date it was
signed and how much HP paid Intel, are blacked out of the
document. Oracle, based in Redwood City, California, seeks to
rescind an agreement that settled litigation over Oracle&#8217;s
hiring of former HP Chief Executive Officer Mark Hurd, as well
as unspecified damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Oracle is in breach of its contractual commitments to HP,
and it has failed to honor its promises to customers,&#8221; Michael
Thacker, a spokesman for Palo Alto, California-based HP, said
Dec. 2 in an e-mailed statement responding to Oracle&#8217;s new
claims. &#8220;Oracle should be addressing and rectifying this
conduct rather than making up claims against HP.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Oracle Corp. (ORCL), 111-
cv-0203163, California Superior Court (Santa Clara County). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, Teva (TEVA) Accused of Keeping Generic Drug Off Market &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s Wyeth unit and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc.
were accused by a group of prescription drug retailers of
illegally keeping a generic version of the Effexor XR
antidepressant off the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Wyeth engaged in an overarching anticompetitive scheme to
prevent and delay the approval and marketing of generic versions
of Effexor XR,&#8221; the retailers, including Walgreen Co. (WAG) and
Kroger Co. (KR), said in a complaint filed Nov. 30 in federal court
in Trenton, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The retailers allege that Wyeth fraudulently obtained
patents and engaged in &#8220;sham litigation&#8221; to delay generic
versions of the extended release drug. They also alleged that
Wyeth and the U.S. unit of Israel-based Teva Pharmaceuticals
Industries Ltd. colluded to keep Teva&#8217;s generic version off the
market until June 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joan Campion, a spokeswoman for New York-based Pfizer, and
Denise Bradley, a spokeswoman for Teva North America, didn&#8217;t
immediately return calls seeking comment on the lawsuit after
regular business hours Dec. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Walgreen v. Wyeth, 11-6985, U.S. District
Court, District of New Jersey (Trenton). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Loses Bid for Order in Effort to Block Samsung Galaxy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. lost a request for a court order in its bid to
block sales of Samsung Electronics Co.&#8217;s 4G smartphone and
Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet computer, according to a ruling that was
posted on a court docket and then removed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iPad maker, in its lawsuit filed in federal court in
San Jose, California, sought an order blocking Samsung from
selling its Galaxy line of mobile devices products in the U.S.
based on claims they violate Apple patents. The lawsuit is part
of a legal battle between the companies being fought in 10
countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung said in an e-mailed statement that the ruling
confirms its long-held view that Apple&#8217;s arguments lack merit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In particular, the court has recognized that Samsung has
raised substantial questions about the validity of certain of
Apple&#8217;s design patents,&#8221; according to the statement. &#8220;We are
confident that we can demonstrate the distinctiveness of
Samsung&#8217;s mobile devices when the case goes to trial next
year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two companies have filed at least 30 lawsuits against
each other, according to Samsung. The conflict began in April,
when Apple filed the San Jose lawsuit claiming the Suwon, South
Korean company&#8217;s Galaxy devices copied the iPhone and iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s no coincidence that Samsung&#8217;s latest products look a
lot like the iPhone and iPad, from the shape of the hardware to
the user interface and even the packaging,&#8221; Kristin Huguet, a
spokeswoman for for Cupertino, California-based Apple, said Dec.
3 in an e-mail. &#8220;This kind of blatant copying is wrong and, as
we&#8217;ve said many times before, we need to protect Apple&#8217;s
intellectual property when companies steal our ideas.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the court docket in San Jose, the ruling,
which was posted temporarily in error late Dec.2, was later
filed under seal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co.,
11-01846, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
(San Jose). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altria Unit Must Pay $47.7 Million to Oregon, Court Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altria Group Inc. (MO)&#8217;s Philip Morris USA must pay $47.7
million to Oregon, the state&#8217;s Supreme Court ruled, rejecting
arguments from the biggest U.S. cigarette maker that the tobacco
industry&#8217;s landmark 1998 settlement with 46 states barred the
recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Oregon Supreme Court decided Dec. 2 that Philip Morris,
a unit of Richmond, Virginia-based Altria, must pay the state 60
percent of a $79.5 million punitive damages award, plus
interest, in a smoking-related wrongful death claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A jury in 1999 awarded that amount, in addition to
compensatory damages, to the estate of Jesse Williams, a smoker
who had died of lung cancer. An Oregon law cited in the court&#8217;s
ruling requires that 60 percent of punitive damages awards go to
the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philip Morris claimed the state released its claim by
signing the $206 billion multistate settlement agreement
resolving health-care cost-recovery lawsuits against U.S.
cigarette makers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe that the Oregon Supreme Court misapplied the
law and reached an erroneous result,&#8221; said Murray Garnick,
Altria Client Services senior vice president and associate
general counsel. &#8220;As the lower court recognized, the state
released its claims to any punitive damages when it signed the
Master Settlement Agreement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Williams v. R.J. Reynolds, SC S059014, Oregon
Supreme Court (Salem). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UniCredit Has $331 Million Asset Ruling Overturned &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A UniCredit SpA (UCG) unit won an appeal overturning a 245
million-euro ($331 million) verdict related to assets of the
former East German Communist Party and the case was returned to
a lower court for a new trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Zurich Court of Cassation on Nov. 30 overturned a lower
Swiss court&#8217;s ruling that the bank must pay the amount to the
German government, Vienna-based UniCredit Bank Austria said in a
statement Dec. 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower Zurich court in 2010 ruled in favor of Germany,
which argued Bank Austria&#8217;s former AKB Privatbank Zuerich unit
helped embezzle funds from companies in the former East Germany.
It will now have to reconsider the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the dispute first went to court in 1994, Germany said
the bank helped launder 250 million deutsche marks ($173
million) that vanished from the accounts of two former East
German trading companies after communism fell. Germany said the
funds were East German state assets that AKB helped shift to the
Austria Communist Party in the 1990s after German reunification.
Germany is also seeking interest on the amount dating from 1992. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany is being represented by Bundesanstalt fuer
vereinigungsbedingte Sonderaufgaben, the legal successor of the
group that was in charge of managing the assets of the former
East Germany. The BvS didn&#8217;t reply to an e-mail by Bloomberg
News requesting a comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bayerische Landesbank Suit Against JPMorgan Most Popular &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase  Co. for fraud by German
lender Bayerische Landesbank, over losses on about $2.1 billion
in mortgage-backed securities, was the most-read litigation
docket on the Bloomberg Law system last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan units concealed the truth about the poor quality
of the loans underlying the securities and knew that credit
ratings misrepresented their risk, BayernLB said in a lawsuit
filed Nov. 21 in New York State Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lender said it believed the mortgage securities were
safe investments based on representations about the quality of
loans and credit ratings when it invested almost $2.1 billion in
57 offerings from 2005 to 2007, according to the complaint. The
lawsuit names JPMorgan and units of the New York-based bank as
defendants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bayerische Landesbank New York Branch v. Bear
Stearns  Co., 653239/2011, New York State Supreme Court, New
York County (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Jef Feeley, Chris Yasiejko and Phil Milford" date="Dec 06, 2011  5:11 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-12-06/pfizer-prempro-drug-caused-women-s-breast-cancer-jury-rules.html"><headline>Pfizer Jury Awards $72 Million After Finding Prempro Caused Breast Cancer</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) must pay $72.6 million in
damages to three women who said they developed breast cancer
after taking the company&#8217;s menopause drugs, a Philadelphia jury
decided. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jurors today in state court deliberated over two days
before finding hormone-replacement drugs made by Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth
and Pharmacia Upjohn units were responsible for Susan Elfont,
Bernadette Kalenkoski and Judy Mulderig developing cancer. The
panel awarded Elfont $20 million in compensatory damages;
Kalenkoski, $27.85 million; and Mulderig, $24.75 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are obviously disappointed with the verdict in this
case,&#8221; Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said in a written
statement. &#8220;Once the verdict is finalized, the company will
weigh its legal options to determine how it will continue with
the case.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 6 million women took Prempro and related
menopause drugs to treat symptoms such as hot flashes and mood
swings before a 2002 study highlighted their links to cancer.
Wyeth&#8217;s sales of the medicines, which are still on the market,
topped $2 billion before the release of the Women&#8217;s Health
Initiative, a National Institutes of Health-sponsored study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Premarin,
Wyeth&#8217;s estrogen-based drug, with progestin-laden Provera, made
by Pfizer&#8217;s Upjohn unit, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth
combined the two hormones in its Prempro pill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Litigation Scorecard &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth and Upjohn units have now lost 10 of the 18
Prempro cases decided by juries since trials began in 2006. The
drugmaker got some of those verdicts thrown out after trial or
had the awards reduced. It resolved some of the verdicts through
settlements, while other decisions are on appeal. It also has
had cases thrown out before trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer announced in May that it had settled a third of the
pending Prempro cases and had set aside $772 million to help
resolve the claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elfont, 66, is a former teacher who once lived in Northeast
Philadelphia, Tobi Millrood, a lawyer for the three women, said
during the trial. She took Premarin and Provera for more than
two years before being diagnosed with breast cancer in 1997,
Millrood said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retired Teacher &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kalenkoski, 68, is a former nursing home aide who took
Prempro for more than four years and was diagnosed with cancer
in 2002, Millrood said. Mulderig, 68, a retired teacher from
Carlisle, Pennsylvania, took Premarin and Provera for 11 years
starting in 1988, the lawyer added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millrood told jurors during the first phase of the two-week
trial that none of the three women had a family history of
breast cancer and experts concluded their use of menopause drugs
led to the development of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millrood declined today to comment on the verdict because
jurors must further consider Wyeth&#8217;s liability for damages in
the second phase of the case, slated to begin Dec. 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diane Sullivan, one of the lawyers for the Pfizer units,
said the evidence was unclear on how long the women had taken
menopause drugs because of gaps in their pharmacy records. She
said the women&#8217;s individual cases differed from those covered by
the WHI study and plaintiffs shouldn&#8217;t be able to rely on that
study to make their case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They are trying to make these women fit with the WHI
study and they don&#8217;t fit,&#8221; Sullivan told the seven-man, five-
woman jury in closing arguments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last Prempro verdict against the Pfizer units came a
year ago in Puerto Rico, where a jury awarded $1.5 million in
damages to a pharmacist who took the menopause drug. The company
won the next two cases before today&#8217;s verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Philadelphia case is Elfont v. Wyeth Pharmaceuticals
Inc., 00924, Jury Term 2004, Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas
(Philadelphia). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BP Plc accused a unit of Halliburton
Co. of intentionally destroying evidence that could be used to
prove the oilfield services firm shares blame for the blowout
that caused the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halliburton Energy Services (HAL) Inc. destroyed test results
that showed samples of the cement used to seal London-based BP&#8217;s
Macondo well, which exploded off the Louisiana coast last year,
were unstable, BP said in a filing yesterday in federal court in
New Orleans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oilfield services provider also suppressed computer
models that might prove Halliburton was at fault &#8220;because it
wanted to eliminate any risk that this evidence would be used
against it at trial,&#8221; BP said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP asked the court to find that Halliburton destroyed
evidence on purpose and to compel the company to turn over for
third-party examination the computer used for the modeling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Halliburton is reviewing the details of the motion filed
today,&#8221; Beverly Stafford, a Halliburton spokeswoman, said in an
e-mail. &#8220;However, we believe that the conclusion that BP is
asking the court to draw is without merit, and we look forward
to contesting their motion in court.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP and Halliburton are suing each other over which
company&#8217;s actions and decisions caused the blowout, which killed
11 workers and sparked the worst offshore oil spill in U.S.
history. The two companies face more than 350 lawsuits by
coastal property owners and businesses claiming billions in
damages from the spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halliburton has raised two primary defenses against
allegations it shares blame for the blowout, BP said in the
filing. First, the contractor maintains its foaming cement
formula was stable and performed as designed, BP said. Second,
Halliburton claims BP chose to use too few &#8220;centralizers&#8221; to
keep the pipe aligned in the well, which allowed hydrocarbons to
escape through channels that formed in the cement liner, BP
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP said Halliburton witnesses and documents uncovered in
pretrial proceedings undercut both defenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rickey Morgan, a Halliburton employee who conducted post-
incident testing on Macondo cement slurry samples at the
company&#8217;s lab in Duncan, Oklahoma, &#8220;testified under oath that
he destroyed test results in order to keep the information from
being &#8216;misinterpreted&#8217; in ways adverse to Halliburton in
litigation,&#8221; BP said in yesterday&#8217;s filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP also asked Barbier to consider levying sanctions against
Halliburton, such as barring the company from using certain
evidence or defenses at trial or even dismissing its claims
against BP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re: Oil Spill by the Oil Rig Deepwater
Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010, MDL-2179, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo Sued by Shareholders Seeking to Maximize Sale Value &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo! Inc., the Internet company exploring strategic
options, was sued by investors who contend the board is shirking
its duties to seek the best possible price for the company if
it&#8217;s sold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sunnyvale, California-based company has instituted
bidding rules that discourage acquisitions that would lead to
replacement of the directors including co-founder Jerry Yang,
MC Partners III contends in a Dec. 1 lawsuit filed in Delaware
Chancery Court in Wilmington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo &#8220;has adopted a confidentiality agreement&#8221; for
bidders, prohibiting them from talking with other bidders and to
&#8220;confine themselves to a bid for only a minority stake,&#8221; MC
lawyers said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Softbank Corp. (9984) are in
advanced talks with Blackstone Group LP and Bain Capital LLC
about making a bid for all of Yahoo, three people with knowledge
of the matter have told Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the lawsuit, MC claims the so-called no cross-talk
provision &#8220;constitutes an unreasonable anti-takeover device&#8221;
and &#8220;tilts the playing field&#8221; in favor of Yang, who wants to
keep &#8220;a disproportionate influence&#8221; over company affairs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was assigned to Judge Sam Glascock III, who
will have to decide whether to grant MC&#8217;s request to invalidate
the &#8220;minority stake promise&#8221; as &#8220;unlawful and
unenforceable,&#8221; according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We aren&#8217;t commenting,&#8221; said Dana Lengkeek, a Yahoo
spokeswoman, in an e-mail message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is MC Partners III v. Jerry Yang and Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO),
CA7082, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank Sued for Billions Over Fund&#8217;s Currency Losses &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) faces a claim that may be worth billions
of dollars in a lawsuit with investment fund Sebastian Holdings
Inc. over failed foreign exchange transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sebastian said in court papers in London that Germany&#8217;s
largest bank allowed a trader to breach currency-trading limits
between 2006 and 2008. Sebastian, owned and run by Norwegian
investor Alexander Vik, said it suffered losses and missed out
on profits worth about $2.5 billion when it had to meet margin
calls and close out positions because of the dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is about a margin call that was missed and remains
unpaid,&#8221; Deutsche Bank said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We will
defend vigorously against the other party&#8217;s claims which are
without merit and date to 2008.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank is pursuing Sebastian in the U.K. courts for
$245 million in unpaid margin calls from the period. Sebastian
has filed a &#8220;substantial&#8221; counterclaim valued at several
billion dollars, its lawyer, Tim Lord, said at a pretrial
hearing in London on Nov. 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute relates to &#8220;exotic derivatives&#8221; and the
breakdown of prime brokerage services provided by Deutsche Bank,
Lord said in November. Sebastian was seeking additional
documents from Deutsche Bank&#8217;s Swiss unit ahead of a trial in
London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unauthorized trades were carried out by Klaus Said,
whom Vik authorized to work on behalf of Sebastian, the fund&#8217;s
lawyers said in London filings. He was only permitted to deal in
&#8220;plain vanilla&#8221; currency, within a strict limit of $35
million. Deutsche Bank was aware of these limits and shouldn&#8217;t
have allowed Said to trade in derivatives, Sebastian says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Said declined to comment when reached by phone at his home
in Connecticut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sebastian, based in the Turks and Caicos, is also suing
Deutsche Bank for $750 million in New York, alleging breach of
fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment and negligent
misrepresentation, according to court documents in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as losses of $750 million from the foreign exchange
trades, Sebastian estimates in the U.K. counterclaim that it has
missed out on profits of about $700 million from having to close
currency, gold and futures positions as well as losing a $1
billion capital fund it held with the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vik &#8220;trusted and relied upon&#8221; his private bankers at
Deutsche Bank for management of Sebastian&#8217;s finances, according
to the claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Deutsche Bank AG v. Sebastian Holdings Inc,
09-83, High Court of Justice, Queen&#8217;s Bench Division, Commercial
Court. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ernst  Young Sued by M-Invest for $900 Million Over Audits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ernst  Young LLP was sued by M-Invest Ltd. for negligence,
malpractice and breach of contract in connection with audits of
financial statements over a five-year period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit seeks $900 million in damages from the New
York-based accounting firm over audits of annual financial
statements for the years 2003 to 2007 for M-Invest, which is in
voluntary liquidation, according to papers filed Dec. 4 in New
York State Supreme Court in Manhattan. The two-page filing
didn&#8217;t provide any details of the allegations against Ernst 
Young. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M-Invest Ltd. is the name of a company that was involved in
a settlement agreement with Irving Picard, the trustee
liquidating Bernard Madoff&#8217;s bankrupt investment firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Union Bancaire Privee, a private Swiss bank accused of
profiting from Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme, agreed to pay as much as
$500 million in December 2010 to settle claims by Picard. The
agreement released claims against Union Bancaire and M-Invest, a
Cayman Islands corporation it set up to invest money with
Madoff. Union Bancaire and M-Invest didn&#8217;t admit any liability
in the settlement, according to the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The suit has no merit and we will defend ourselves,&#8221;
Ernst  Young said in a statement. Eric Seiler, an attorney
representing M-Invest, didn&#8217;t return a phone message seeking
comment on the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is M-Invest Ltd. v. Ernst  Young LLP,
653353/2011, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bayer Withheld Yasmin Data From U.S., Former FDA Head Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Bayer AG unit&#8217;s researchers found increased reports of
blood clots in users of its Yasmin birth-control pills and the
company withheld the information from U.S. regulators, the
former head of the Food and Drug Administration said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Kessler, the former FDA commissioner, in a document
unsealed yesterday in federal court in Illinois, said Bayer
didn&#8217;t include an analysis &#8220;that demonstrated an increase in
the U.S. reporting rate&#8221; for venous thromboembolism, or clots,
in a 2004 review of Yasmin&#8217;s safety provided to the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report also didn&#8217;t include an earlier draft opinion by
company researchers that &#8220;spontaneous reporting data do signal
a difference in the VTE rates for Yasmin&#8221; compared with other
oral contraceptives, Kessler said, quoting the draft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Bayer presented a selective view of the data, and that
presentation obscured the potential risks associated with
Yasmin,&#8221; Kessler said. The company also promoted the oral
contraceptive for unapproved uses, particularly for treatment of
premenstrual syndrome, Kessler said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kessler&#8217;s report and four other expert opinions were
released yesterday by lawyers representing former users of
Bayer&#8217;s Yasmin family of contraceptives. The experts were paid
by the plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers, who submitted the reports to the
FDA, which is considering safety findings on Yasmin and its
sister product Yaz at a hearing Dec. 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rose Talarico, a U.S.-based spokeswoman for Bayer, said the
company doesn&#8217;t comment on ongoing lawsuits. &#8220;We have nothing
further to add as these are matters of litigation,&#8221; she said in
an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We expect them to be addressed further
at trial.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Liscinsky, an FDA spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t immediately
comment on the unsealed documents about the drugmaker&#8217;s handling
of the contraceptives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA didn&#8217;t accept the documents for the hearing,
according to an e-mail sent to plaintiffs&#8217; lawyer Ned McWilliams
after business hours yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The deadline for all written submissions was on November
23, 2011,&#8221; Kalyani Bhatt, of the FDA&#8217;s Division of Advisory
Committee and Consultant Management, wrote. &#8220;We will not be
able to accept any written submission at this time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bayer faces more than 10,000 lawsuits over injuries
allegedly caused by the contraceptives. Lawyers suing the
drugmaker cited FDA reports of at least 50 deaths tied to the
pills from 2004 to 2008. The first trials are scheduled for next
month in federal court in Illinois and state court in
Philadelphia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Yasmin and Yaz (Drospirenone) Marketing,
Sales Practices and Product Liability Litigation, 09-md-02100,
U.S. District Court, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
Illinois (East St. Louis). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Madoff Trustee Appeals $19 Billion JPMorgan Ruling &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The liquidator of Bernard L. Madoff&#8217;s firm, who lost the
right to demand $19 billion in damages from JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM), appealed the ruling to a higher court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan last month won the dismissal of trustee Irving
Picard&#8217;s damage claims in his lawsuit alleging the biggest U.S.
bank aided Madoff&#8217;s fraud. Picard can&#8217;t sue for common-law
damages on behalf of the defunct Madoff firm&#8217;s customers, U.S.
District Judge Colleen McMahon ruled in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge told Picard he could go ahead and appeal her
ruling after getting JPMorgan&#8217;s consent to do so, according to
court papers. Picard agreed to put his remaining claims against
New York-based JPMorgan on hold while he appeals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rulings by district judges McMahon and Jed Rakoff have
knocked more than $28 billion off of Picard&#8217;s claims against
banks and may cost him as much as $11 billion in recoveries from
other cases aimed at benefiting investors who lost money in the
Ponzi scheme, according to the trustee&#8217;s estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it didn&#8217;t know about the fraud and couldn&#8217;t
be held responsible for a scheme orchestrated by Madoff alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff pleaded guilty and is serving a 150-year prison
term. Picard and his firm have made about $224 million in fees
since Madoff&#8217;s 2008 arrest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The McMahon cases are Picard v. JPMorgan Chase  Co., 11-
cv-913; Picard v. UBS Fund Services (Luxembourg) SA, 11-cv-4212,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANZ Customers Can Proceed With Fees Lawsuit, Judge Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia  New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) customers
seeking to recoup fees they claim were illegal can proceed with
part of the lawsuit after a judge ruled credit-card charges for
late payments can be challenged in court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Court Justice Michelle Gordon issued the ruling in
Melbourne yesterday, dismissing complaints about charges for
insufficient funds in accounts or overdrawn bank accounts,
ruling those didn&#8217;t amount to penalties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANZ is the first of 12 banks that IMF Australia Ltd. (IMF), the
country&#8217;s biggest litigation funder, planned to sue in a bid to
recoup as much as A$5 billion ($5.1 billion) that Australian
account holders paid in fees in the past six years, according to
James Middleweek, managing director at IMF&#8217;s Financial Redress
Pty unit. Customers holding almost 246,000 accounts have
registered to sue, according to IMF&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is the first important ruling in what will
undoubtedly be a long, drawn-out process,&#8221; Middleweek said in a
phone interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The credit card late-payment charges make up about 40
percent of the A$50 million in refunds for so-called exception
fees sought by ANZ&#8217;s customers, Andrew Watson, a principal at
Maurice Blackburn Lawyers, who is representing the plaintiffs,
said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANZ, based in Melbourne, said it welcomed the ruling
because it was largely vindicated by it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision will &#8220;almost certainly&#8221; be appealed, Watson
said. He said the High Court of Australia, the country&#8217;s top
court, would probably have to decide whether the concept of
penalties can be expanded to include those charges rejected by
Gordon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Andrews v. ANZ Banking Group Ltd. VID811/2010.

&lt;p&gt;Australian Federal Court Lifts Freeze on Magnitogorsk Assets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia&#8217;s federal court lifted a freeze on OAO
Magnitogorsk Iron  Steel (MMK)&#8217;s assets in the country, including a
stake in Fortescue Metals Group Ltd., after a dispute with
Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. was resolved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MMK, as Magnitogorsk is known, had a freeze imposed on
Australian assets valued at as much as A$858 million ($877
million), according to a Nov. 25 order made in Sydney by Federal
Court Justice Steven Rares. The figure included a 4.99 percent
stake valued at about A$735 million in Perth-based Fortescue,
Australia&#8217;s third-largest iron-ore exporter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Peter Jacobson yesterday ordered the freeze lifted
and allowed MMK and Swiss trader ENRC Marketing AG, an ENRC
unit, which had sought the freeze amidst a dispute over iron-ore
shipments, to file a notice that the lawsuit is being
discontinued, according to a posting on the Federal Court&#8217;s
website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MMK and ENRC said in a statement later they had
&#8220;amicably&#8221; settled their dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;ENRC and MMK continue to benefit from long-term
partnership and we are pleased to retain MMK as one of our
valued customers,&#8221; ENRC Chief Executive Officer Felix Vulis
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mutual waiver of claims confirmed the companies&#8217;
intention to &#8220;cooperate on a long-term basis,&#8221; MMK CEO Boris
Dubrovsky said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is between ENRC Marketing AG and OJSC

&lt;p&gt;Trials &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blood-Test Case at Top Court May Send Patent &#8216;Shock Waves&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer, drug and biotechnology companies have a message
for the U.S. Supreme Court as it prepares for arguments this
week on patents for diagnostic medical tests: Be careful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies, trade groups and lawyers have filed more than
two dozen legal briefs, many warning that the court&#8217;s ruling
might have widespread, unintended ramifications. Each side in
the case, which pits Nestle SA (NESN)&#8217;s Prometheus unit against the
Mayo Clinic, says a defeat might stifle innovation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The claims have to do with diagnostic methods, but it has
the potential to touch industries we don&#8217;t know about,&#8221; said
Erika Arner, a Washington lawyer who filed a brief asking the
court not to restrict software and computer patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the court will consider the most fundamental
question in patent law -- what can be patented -- the ruling
&#8220;will or could have shock waves across all industries,&#8221; said
Arner, who represents SAP America Inc., a business-software
maker based in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is the second at the Supreme Court since 2010
concerning what types of inventions are eligible for legal
protection. The latest case, to be heard tomorrow, will test the
longstanding principle that natural phenomenon can&#8217;t be
patented. A lower court ruled that two patents now owned by
Prometheus were potentially valid because they involve the
application of a law of nature, not the law itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patents cover a method for determining the proper
dosage of thiopurine, a stomach medicine, based on the rate at
which particular patients metabolize the drug. Doctors can use
the method, which involves testing blood for metabolites, to
maximize effectiveness and limit toxic side effects while
treating Crohn&#8217;s disease and other inflammatory bowel illnesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prometheus is suing two units of the Mayo Clinic, the not-
for-profit medical practice based in Rochester, Minnesota. Mayo
licensed the patents until 2004, when it created its own test. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayo contends the patents would give Prometheus a monopoly
over all uses of the natural relationship between the
metabolites created by thiopurine and the drug&#8217;s impact on the
human body. The patents are so broad they would bar doctors
familiar with the Prometheus method from even thinking about the
connection between metabolite levels and the proper dosage for a
patient, Mayo&#8217;s lawyers say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus
Laboratories, 10-1150. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-NYSE Euronext (NYX) Chief Wins Reversal of $11 Million Verdict &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former NYSE Euronext President Gerald D. Putnam won
reversal of an $11 million jury verdict in a lawsuit accusing
him and two other people of cheating a former business partner
of money from the development of the electronic stock exchange
Archipelago Holdings LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Illinois appellate panel on Dec. 2 threw out the jury&#8217;s
2009 award, ruling that Lewis Borsellino, a former business
partner and commodities trader, previously agreed to release the
defendants from liability in exchange for $250,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1998, Borsellino&#8217;s company sued companies controlled by
Putnam and Stuart and MarrGwen Townsend, with whom he had formed
Chicago Trading  Arbitrage LLC. After the case settled, he sued
again, claiming he had been misled about whether CTA money was
used to create Archipelago. Archipelago merged in 2006 with the
New York Stock Exchange creating NYSE Group Inc., now part of
New York-based NYSE Euronext. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Borsellino not only retained payment under the release,
but also does not seek to rescind the release,&#8221; Illinois
Appellate Court Judge Robert E. Gordon wrote. &#8220;The release
barred Borsellino&#8217;s claim and we must reverse the judgment of
the trial court.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borsellino&#8217;s attorney, Jon Loevy of Chicago, said in a
voice-mail message that the appellate ruling was a mistake of
law that he expects will be rectified by the Illinois Supreme
Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nothing in the court&#8217;s opinion disturbed the jury&#8217;s
finding that the defendants committed fraud,&#8221; Loevy said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for Putnam and the Townsends, Michael Pollard,
said by e-mail that he was confident the intermediate-level
appellate court ruling will withstand any further review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The court&#8217;s decision vindicates our clients after a
decade of litigation and reverses the outcome of a trial that
should have never taken place,&#8221; Pollard said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Borsellino v. Putnam, 2011 IL App 102242,
Illinois Appellate Court, First District, Sixth Division
(Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC Must Pay $62 Million Over Improper Sales to Elderly &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) must pay 39.8 million pounds ($62.2
million), including a record fine, for telling elderly people to
buy products to fund nursing-home costs that paid out after some
of them were expected to die. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank was fined 10.5 million pounds, the largest-ever
penalty in the U.K. over sales of financial products, the
Financial Services Authority said in a statement yesterday. The
lender estimated it would have to pay about 29.3 million pounds
to compensate customers, the FSA said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC&#8217;s NHFA unit advised 2,485 customers with an average
age of 83 to invest in asset-backed products to fund their long-
term care. The investments typically were recommended for a
minimum five-year period, which in some cases was longer than
the customers&#8217; life expectancies, causing them to make
withdrawals sooner than recommended, the regulator said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HSBC unit made &#8220;unsuitable sales&#8221; to around 87
percent of its customers for these types of investments over a
five-year period until 2010, the regulator said. The customers
invested as much as 285 million pounds, an average of 115,000
pounds per customer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC Bank Plc Chief Executive Officer Brian Robertson said
in a statement he is &#8220;profoundly sorry&#8221; that the NHFA &#8220;failed
to give suitable financial advice to some of their customers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank reported the issue to the FSA and closed the unit
to new business on July 1, Robertson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC said it is reviewing the matter and will contact
affected customers. The bank received the FSA&#8217;s standard 30
percent discount on the fine for settling early in the probe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam&#8217;s Trades May Run From Stamps to Mackerel Packets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raj Rajaratnam leaves behind the ruins of a Wall Street
career that made him a billionaire hedge fund manager to begin
an 11-year prison sentence, the price for running a far-flung
insider-trading conspiracy that turned tips from company
executives and technology consultants into cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He will trade in suits for a uniform, a luxury Manhattan
apartment for a cell, and credit cards and cash for postage
stamps and mackerel packets, the black market currency of his
new home. The millions of dollars he made on illegal trades will
be replaced by manual labor that starts at 12 cents an hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, 54, reported to Federal Medical Center Devens,
located on a decommissioned military base in Ayer,
Massachusetts, at about 12:30 p.m. yesterday, said Robert Lanza,
a prison spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam will be fingerprinted, searched, interviewed and
issued a prison identification card with his inmate number,
62785-054, said John Colautti, a spokesman for the Devens
facility. He will only be permitted to keep his wedding ring,
glasses and a few other approved items, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most inmates reporting to Devens for their initial prison
assignment are sent to the Special Housing Unit, a high-security
lockup where they stay for 23 hours a day, until their
tuberculosis test results are processed, according to Colautti. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, was sentenced in October after a federal jury
in Manhattan found him guilty of 14 counts of securities fraud
and conspiracy. He directed colleagues, consultants and
corporate officers to leak information that made him tens of
millions of dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His was the longest sentence ever handed down for such a
crime, and the culmination of a four-year nationwide probe of
insider trading. Last week, a three-judge panel rejected his
last-minute plea to remain free while he appeals his conviction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 09-01184, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s
biggest company by market value, expects Abu Dhabi to change the
terms for the Persian Gulf emirate&#8217;s main oil producing
concession when the current agreement expires in 2014, its chief
executive officer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The concession structure and terms that served all
parties well in the past are just no longer appropriate in
today&#8217;s environment, both in terms of cost and prices,&#8221; Rex Tillerson said today at the World Petroleum Congress in Doha.
&#8220;Everyone is committed to finding that new structure that
allows us to continue to work together.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) and BP Plc produce oil at
onshore fields in Abu Dhabi under a concession agreement that
dates back to 1939. The fields began commercial production in
1960 and Abu Dhabi&#8217;s state-run oil company joined as a partner
in the 1970s, forming the current operating venture Abu Dhabi
Co. for Onshore Oil Operations, or ADCO. ADCO holds the
concession for six main onshore fields until 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joint venture agreement is &#8220;under very active
discussion with the national oil company and government of Abu
Dhabi,&#8221; Tillerson said, without giving further details. Shell&#8217;s
Chief Executive Officer Peter Voser, also attending the Doha
conference, declined to comment on the concession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Dhabi holds more than 90 percent of crude in the United
Arab Emirates, one of the few Middle East states that allow
foreign companies to explore for and produce oil within its
borders. State-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., or Adnoc, holds
60 percent of ADCO, with the international oil companies Exxon,
Shell, BP, Total SA (FP) and Partex Oil  Gas holding the rest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Dhabi is the largest sheikhdom of the United Arab
Emirates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia&#8217;s financial markets watchdog
is opening an insider-trading investigation into OAO Rosneft&#8217;s
share-price increase before the oil producer formed a strategic
alliance with Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probe will take at least six months, Interfax said
today, citing an unidentified Federal Financial Markets Service
official. The regulator&#8217;s press service confirmed the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosneft, Russia&#8217;s largest oil producer, jumped 9 percent on
the Micex exchange in Moscow in the two days leading up to the
deal. The state-run company and Exxon Mobil signed the agreement
about an hour before the close of trading on Aug. 30. The
benchmark Micex Index (INDEXCF) gained 3.8 percent on Aug. 29 and 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosneft selected Exxon as a partner to tap the Kara Sea, a
little-explored area in the Arctic that may be an extension of
Russia&#8217;s western Siberian oil province, after an agreement with
BP Plc collapsed. The two will also explore deep-water Black Sea
deposits. In return, Exxon will offer Rosneft participation in
projects in Canada, Texas, the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosneft&#8217;s press service didn&#8217;t immediately comment when
called by Bloomberg. Olga Shishkina, a spokeswoman for Exxon
Mobil in Moscow, declined by e-mail to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO) beverages were tampered
with in northern China, where police are investigating after a
child in the city of Changchun was killed and three other people
were sickened in the incident, the government said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Dangerous substances&#8221; were added to Coca-Cola&#8217;s Minute
Maid strawberry-flavored pulpy milk beverage, according to a
statement posted on a website affiliated to the Jilin provincial
government, where Changchun is the capital. The world&#8217;s largest
soft-drink maker said today tests showed the death and illness
weren&#8217;t related to the quality of its product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola reviewed production and warehousing processes,
checked retained samples of production batches and had tests
conducted by the China National Center for Food Quality
Supervision and Testing, the Atlanta-based beverage maker said
in an e-mailed statement. Its Sprite lemon-lime drink, the
nation&#8217;s biggest seller, was tampered with in 2009 and 2010
cases of mercury poisoning that injured two people in Beijing,
the official Xinhua News Agency reported at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Tests and reviews indicate our products are safe and
within standards, and reaffirm the incident is not related to
the quality of our products,&#8221; Coca-Cola said in the statement
today. &#8220;We are 100 percent confident in the safety and quality
of our products.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth Market &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola and its Chinese bottling partners will invest $4
billion in the world&#8217;s fastest growing economy over three years
from 2012 amid plans to build more factories and win market
share from rival PepsiCo Inc., it said in August. The company is
also talking to regulators about selling shares in China, which
Chief Executive Muhtar Kent described as &#8220;one of our most
important growth markets in the world.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales surpassed 1 billion unit cases in the six months
through June, compared with 2005, when it sold that amount for
the whole year, Coca-Cola has said. Each unit case has 24 eight-
ounce servings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola controlled about 62 percent of the country&#8217;s soft
drinks market last year, followed by PepsiCo Inc. with 29
percent, Euromonitor International estimates. Minute Maid is one
of Coca-Cola&#8217;s best-selling brands in China, according to the
London-based researcher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food Protection &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China has pledged to strengthen food protection after baby
formula tainted with melamine killed at least six infants and
sickened thousands in 2008. Tainted milk powder, banned
additives in pork and buns dyed with chemicals have fueled food-
safety concerns in China and spurred the government to pledge
greater protection for consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incident involving Minute Maid milk drinks occurred
Nov. 28, state-run Xinhua reported. Separately, two Changchun
residents were hospitalized the same day after consuming the
same product, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mother of the child who was killed remains in a
hospital in stable condition, Xinhua reported today. The other
two were discharged, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola has been in contact with the affected families,
Joanna Price, the company&#8217;s Shanghai-based spokeswoman, said
today by phone. She declined to provide more information as the
investigation is ongoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Minute Maid drinks, made by Coca-Cola&#8217;s Jilin
subsidiary, were temporarily taken off store shelves last week
in Jilin after the incident, Xinhua reported. Government tests
of samples showed the beverage to be safe, according to the news
agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least five calls to Changchun police&#8217;s news office today
went unanswered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charter Hall Office (CQO), which yesterday
accepted a sweetened A$1.2 billion ($1.3 billion) bid from two
overseas funds, made the most logical decision possible,
analysts at JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Australian property trust&#8217;s independent directors
yesterday approved a A$2.49-a-share conditional offer from Reco
Ambrosia Pte, an affiliate of the Government of Singapore
Investment Corp., and the Public Sector Pension Investment Board
of Canada. The bid was a 6-cent-a-unit improvement to the funds&#8217;
last offer on Oct. 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest bid is &#8220;in the best interests of Charter Hall
Office unitholders,&#8221; the REIT&#8217;s independent directors wrote in
unanimously backing the offer yesterday. The shares climbed by
the most in more than three months in Sydney trading today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the absence of a higher bid, we see logic in the
directors&#8217; decision,&#8221; JPMorgan analysts led by Michael Scott
wrote in a report dated yesterday. Still, &#8220;we would have liked
to see a final offer price closer to net tangible assets,&#8221;
Scott wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charter Hall Office could receive a higher bid than the
funds&#8217; offer -- which is at a 4.2 percent discount to the
trust&#8217;s Australian net tangible assets per share of A$2.60 as of
June 30 -- if shareholders vote against it, analysts at CLSA
Asia-Pacific Markets, led by Bryan Howitt, wrote in a report
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Asset Sale &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal is conditional on stipulations including an
approval of the offer by 75 percent of Charter Hall Office
unitholders and the completion of the sale of its U.S. assets,
the group said. The trust is in the process of selling its U.S.
properties to entities affiliated with Beacon Capital Partners
for $1.71 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charter Hall Office shares rose 4.4 percent to A$3.57 as of
the 4:10 p.m. close of trading in Sydney, more than A$1 higher
than the offer price due to the anticipated distribution from
the U.S. asset sale. JPMorgan estimates the U.S. assets will net
A$1.14 per share, based on current exchange rates. The shares
have jumped 24 percent since Aug. 26, before the group&#8217;s first
approach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charter Hall Group (CHC), the trust&#8217;s current manager, will
retain its management and 14.5 percent stake, the group said
yesterday. A binding agreement must be executed by Dec. 22, and
the proposal must be implemented by March 31 for the offer to
become effective, Charter Hall Office said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bidders&#8217; first two offers, at A$2.39 per unit, followed

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) investor
James Mercer, in a lawsuit against former board member Rajat Gupta in which the bank is a &#8220;nominal plaintiff,&#8221; filed court
papers opposing a motion by the defendant to dismiss the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the lawsuit, Mercer alleged Gupta disclosed confidential
bank information to Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam,
the hedge-fund manager who was later convicted of insider
trading. Gupta has been charged by federal prosecutors in
connection with the Rajaratnam probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Gupta did not provide confidential information about the
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to Raj Rajaratnam without purpose,&#8221;
Mercer said in the filing today in Manhattan federal court. &#8220;He
did it for pecuniary gain.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary Naftalis, Gupta&#8217;s lawyer, declined to comment on the
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
started administrative proceedings against Gupta over claims of
securities fraud. Mercer sued in June, seeking to recover short-
swing profits generated by Galleon trades in Goldman Sachs
stock. Short-swing profits are profits made by an insider on the
purchase and sale, within six months, of company stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legal Beneficiary &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercer claimed that Gupta, who as a Goldman Sachs director
is considered a company insider, should be deemed the legal
beneficiary of the Galleon trades. Gupta was alleged by the SEC
to have given Rajaratnam tips about Goldman Sachs&#8217;s quarterly
financial results before they were made public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In seeking to dismiss Mercer&#8217;s suit in November, Gupta
said, &#8220;the complaint&#8217;s allegations are all about tipping and
not about trading by Mr. Gupta. The complaint fails to allege a
purchase or sale by Mr. Gupta of even a single share of Goldman
Sachs stock.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercer countered today that Gupta, by owning Goldman Sachs
shares, benefited from Rajaratnam&#8217;s trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, didn&#8217;t immediately return a call seeking comment on the
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercer contacted Goldman Sachs after the SEC proceedings
began in March and demanded that it initiate legal action
against Gupta, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was made a nominal plaintiff because it&#8217;s the
statutory beneficiary of any illegal profits from trades
prompted by Gupta&#8217;s tips, Mercer argued in his complaint. He
also claimed that Gupta benefited from the illegal trades as an
investor in Rajaratnam&#8217;s funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta was indicted by a federal grand jury in October on
five counts of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy to
commit securities fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam was convicted on insider-trading charges and is
serving an 11-year prison sentence in Ayer, Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Mercer v. Gupta, 11-3828, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, won a U.S. panel&#8217;s backing for an experimental
medicine for advanced kidney cancer in patients who have failed
prior treatments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefits of the drug, known as axitinib, outweigh its
risks, 13 outside advisers to the Food and Drug Administration
said today in a unanimous vote in Silver Spring, Maryland. The
FDA isn&#8217;t required to follow advisory panels&#8217; recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medicine from New York-based Pfizer may compete with
Aveo Pharmaceuticals Inc. (AVEO)&#8217;s tivozanib, a kidney-cancer drug in
late-stage clinical trials. Both treatments block receptors in
the body thought to play a role in spreading tumors. Kidney
cancer affects 296,000 people in the U.S., according to the
American Cancer Society. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It met the regulatory bar&#8221; for approval &#8220;and offers an
important or useful alternative&#8221; to approved treatments, said
Wyndham Wilson, the panel chairman, who is chief of lymphoma
therapeutics at the National Cancer Institute&#8217;s Center for
Cancer Research, in Rockville, Maryland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer gained 1.2 percent to $20.47 at the close in New
York. The shares have increased 17 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of axitinib, if approved, may reach $576 million in
2014, according to the average estimate of three analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Pfizer is seeking to sell the treatment
under the name Inlyta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional Options &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased with the panel&#8217;s recommendation in support
of axitinib for the treatment of previously treated advanced
renal cell carcinoma, as additional therapeutic options are
still needed for this patient population,&#8221; Mace Rothenberg,
senior vice president of clinical development and medical
affairs at Pfizer, said in an e-mail after the vote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FDA staff reviewers questioned the significance of efficacy
data in a trial that compared axitinib with kidney-cancer drug
Nexavar from German drugmaker Bayer AG. In the study of 723
patients who had failed one prior therapy, those treated with
axitinib lived a median of 6.7 months before their tumors got
worse, two months longer than those who received Nexavar, agency
staff said in a Dec. 5 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That two-month benefit was &#8220;driven by a subset of patients
that is likely to be scarce in the United States,&#8221; the
reviewers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous Treatments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axitinib was most effective in people previously treated
with cytokines, immune-boosting drugs that aren&#8217;t as widely used
as newer therapies such Pfizer&#8217;s Sutent. Patients in the
cytokine group who received axitinib lived a median of 5.6
months longer without tumor progression than those in that group
who were treated with Nexavar, agency reviewers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axitinib&#8217;s benefits were &#8220;meager&#8221; in the larger group of
patients treated previously with Sutent, delaying tumor growth
just 1.4 months longer than Nexavar did, according to the
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA&#8217;s concerns about axitinib may have &#8220;positive
implications&#8221; for the competing drug being developed by
Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Aveo, said Thomas Wei, an analyst
at Jefferies  Co. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We remain bullish on the prospects for tivozanib to
become the standard of care in the first-line treatment of renal
cell carcinoma,&#8221; Wei said Dec. 5 in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Michael J. Moore and Christine Harper" date="Dec 07, 2011  3:41 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-12-07/jpmorgan-has-about-100-billion-of-notional-giips-derivatives.html"><headline>JPMorgan Has About $100 Billion of Notional GIIPS Derivatives</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
derivatives dealer among U.S. banks, has bought and sold
notional credit derivatives on about $100 billion of sovereign
and non-sovereign debt in the five troubled European nations,
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank had about $13.9 billion of mark-to-market
derivative exposure as of Nov. 17, offset by $6.3 billion of
collateral, Dimon said at an investor conference in New York.
JPMorgan would likely have a direct loss of about $3 billion if
a &#8220;disaster&#8221; occurred in the region&#8217;s debt crisis, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I get asked the question with derivatives of $14 billion,
people say &#8216;my God, that&#8217;s your net because you have huge long
and short,&#8217; and we do. It&#8217;s maybe $100 billion by $100 billion,
I forgot the exact number,&#8221; Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disclosure is the first by a major U.S. bank regarding
the notional derivatives it bought and sold on the region as
investors seek to judge banks&#8217; risks linked to the European debt
crisis. Banks provide their global notional credit derivatives
bought and sold, and have begun providing net exposure figures
to Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain, sometimes called
the GIIPS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon said the bank doesn&#8217;t net its derivative exposure
across counterparties, so it would not sell protection on
Italian debt to one bank and buy credit-default swaps on Italian
debt from another and consider those exposures offsetting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The default of a counterparty is not going to sink our
hedges,&#8221; Dimon said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t have a lot of wrong-way risk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counterparties &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit derivatives counterparties are primarily outside the
GIIPS and are either investment-grade or are supported by
collateral arrangements, according to a presentation from the
bank. Dimon also said all the firm&#8217;s hedging was done with
counterparties outside the five countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Sept. 30, JPMorgan said worldwide it had sold $3.13
trillion of credit-derivative protection and purchased $3.07
trillion, up from $2.75 trillion sold and $2.72 trillion bought
at the end of 2010, filings show. The firm was the largest
dealer of credit derivatives among U.S. banks in the second
quarter, according to data from the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MF Global Inc. brokerage trustee
James Giddens must disclose more details of his work for
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP before a
judge determines whether he can handle the case disinterestedly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn in a court order today
told the trustee to say whether PwC or JPMorgan, agent for a
$300 million loan to MF Global&#8217;s parent, or any of the company&#8217;s
other lenders are currently clients of Giddens&#8217;s law firm,
Hughes Hubbard  Reed LLP, and if so, the fees billed or
collected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glenn, in Manhattan, also wants to know whether any of the
law firm&#8217;s other current clients are creditors of the brokerage
and how much they have paid in fees. In addition, he asked
whether JPMorgan was a creditor of the brokerage, and whether
Giddens could sue the bank if necessary. The information must be
in the judge&#8217;s hands by 5 p.m. on Dec. 12, Glenn said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The status of an entity as a current client (as opposed
to a former client) can make an important difference in
evaluating conflicts and disinterestedness,&#8221; the judge said in
the order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glenn directed Giddens to disclose his business ties to New
York-based JPMorgan after two brokerage customers said the
trustee&#8217;s links to the parent company&#8217;s lender might influence
his treatment of the brokerage&#8217;s customers. Giddens&#8217;s initial
disclosure failed to give details of his firm&#8217;s current work for
JPMorgan, the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Sparse&#8217; Disclosures &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brokerage&#8217;s parent, MF Global Holdings Ltd., is in a
separate court proceeding, also being handled by Glenn. The
parent and its brokerage have made &#8220;sparse&#8221; disclosures about
the facts leading to the companies&#8217; collapse, the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Press reports have &#8220;raised questions&#8221; about whether funds
or property were transferred from the brokerage to JPMorgan
before the bankruptcies, Glenn said in explaining why he wants
more disclosure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe that HHR&#8217;s representation of the Trustee in
this matter is appropriate and there are already existing
procedures in place to deal with any apparent conflicts
concerning legal actions going forward,&#8221; Kent Jarrell, a
Giddens spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We will be
submitting answers to questions asked by the court.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Account Transfers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giddens, who is liquidating the brokerage, has transferred
about 38,000 commodity accounts to other firms, and said he
plans to sell 330 securities accounts. Three transfers of
collateral made and pending will give commodity customers about
$4 billion of their assets, according to court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parent company&#8217;s Oct. 31 bankruptcy filing, the eighth-
largest in U.S. history, listed assets of $41 billion. Jon Corzine, the former co-chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., quit as MF Global&#8217;s CEO on Nov. 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brokerage case is Securities Investor Protection Corp.
v. MF Global Inc., 11-02790, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). The parent&#8217;s bankruptcy case
is MF Global Holdings Ltd., 11-bk-15059, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest
U.S. lender by assets, will have &#8220;essentially flat&#8221; investment
bank revenue this quarter excluding accounting adjustments,
according to Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comparison is to this year&#8217;s third quarter, said
Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for the New York-based firm.
That period was the worst for trading and investment-banking
revenue at the biggest Wall Street firms since the depths of the
financial crisis in 2008, excluding accounting gains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon&#8217;s remarks in a presentation today show U.S.
investment banks still face pressure as corporations delay
raising capital and investors sell riskier assets amid concern
that the U.S. economy is weakening and Europe&#8217;s debt crisis may
spread. JPMorgan&#8217;s private-equity unit also expects to post a
&#8220;modest loss&#8221; in this year&#8217;s fourth quarter, Dimon wrote in
the presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s investment bank generated about $4.5 billion
in revenue during the third quarter after backing out a $1.9
billion gain in debt-valuation adjustments. Dimon excluded that
accounting effect in forecasting the unit&#8217;s revenue in the
presentation at a New York investor conference sponsored by
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debt Ceiling &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue at the investment-banking unit has slid this year
from $8.2 billion in the first quarter as concerns mounted in
the third quarter that Greece would default and U.S. lawmakers
would fail to raise the debt ceiling. JPMorgan told investors in
October that the division will face similar market conditions
for the rest of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit&#8217;s long-term prospects show promise, Dimon said in
the presentation. Global credit needs may expand by about $160
trillion over the next 10 years and worldwide investment demand
may increase from 20 percent of gross domestic product in 2010
to 25 percent by 2030, according to the presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan climbed 1.7 percent to $33.80 at 1:22 p.m. in New
York, making it the day&#8217;s biggest gainer (INDU) in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank has a &#8220;battleship&#8221; balance sheet (JPM), and by next
year can meet proposed international capital standards that take
full effect in 2019, if the board wants to meet them early,
Dimon said in the presentation. Dimon has previously referred to
JPMorgan as having a &#8220;fortress&#8221; balance sheet to tout the
bank&#8217;s overall financial health. The company is the largest and
most profitable U.S. bank and was among the only major U.S.
lenders to remain profitable throughout the recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;We&#8217;re Sorry&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan may buy back an additional $950 million in stock
approved as part of a $15 billion capital-distribution program
by the Federal Reserve, according to the presentation. The
allowance &#8220;represents a reallocation of previously approved
capacity&#8221; from the Fed&#8217;s 2011 capital tests, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank completed its $8 billion stock-repurchase plan
approved by the Fed in March after buying back $4.4 billion of
common equity in the third quarter, for which Dimon apologized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We spent a whole $8 billion buying back stock,&#8221; he said
in an Oct. 13 conference call with analysts. &#8220;And yes, it would
have been wiser to wait. We&#8217;re sorry.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
will reach a settlement with European Union antitrust regulators
next week to end a probe into mainframe software, according to
two people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission intends to accept an offer made by
IBM in September to resolve a dispute over anti-competitive
behaviour that may have blocked rival mainframe software makers,
said the people who couldn&#8217;t be identified because the talks are
private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators have sought comments from rivals and customers
on IBM&#8217;s commitments to ensure the availability of certain spare
parts and technical information. The Brussels-based regulator
closed a separate probe over IBM&#8217;s mainframe computers after
three competitors dropped complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission in 2010 opened investigations into Armonk,
New York-based IBM over possible anti-competitive behavior that
may have blocked competitors in mainframe software and
maintenance contracts by &#8220;restricting or delaying access to
spare parts.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Hanley, a spokesman for IBM in London, declined to
comment. Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for the commission, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to a call and e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reuters reported the settlement earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global attempts to curb greenhouse

senior U.S. investment strategist, said in a research note to

&lt;p&gt;Negotiators from more than 190 countries at United Nations-

strategist known for predicting the 1990s bull market, wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Instead, we expect to see a further transition to a

&lt;p&gt;Emirates NBD PJSC, the United Arab
Emirates&#8217; biggest bank by assets, may need to set aside as much
as 8 billion dirhams ($2.2 billion) by the end of 2013 to cover
for bad loans, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS) said. The shares dropped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Looking at the guidance provided on asset quality trends,
we calculate a provisioning range of 6 billion dirhams and 8
billion dirhams is required between the fourth-quarter of 2011
and the fourth-quarter of 2013,&#8221; analysts including Waleed Mohsin and Ali Shekofti wrote in a report dated today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emirates NBD is one of the biggest creditors to Dubai
World, one of the emirate&#8217;s three main state-owned holding
companies that reached a deal in March to delay payments on $25
billion of loans. It is also a key lender to units of Dubai
Holding LLC, one of whose investment companies is in talks with
banks to reschedule at least $10 billion of liabilities. The
bank in October took over the unprofitable Dubai Bank on orders
from the emirate&#8217;s ruler. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-performing loans on the books of Dubai&#8217;s banks will
peak at 15 percent to 16 percent in 2013, up from 4.8 percent in
2009 and 11.3 percent in 2010, investment bank Exotix Ltd. said
Dec. 4. Moody&#8217;s Investors Service expects provisions to peak at
13 percent to 16 percent next year, it said in a report Nov. 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The significant increase in the renegotiated private
sector loans hides the true extent of the banks&#8217; asset quality
problems,&#8221; Fitch Rating said in a report on U.A.E. banks
yesterday. &#8220;Whilst fundamental credit issues in the operating
environment remain unresolved, some of these loans may re-emerge
as non-performing loans.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares Drop &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which has a &#8220;neutral&#8221; recommendation on
Emirates NBD (EMIRATES), cut the price estimate of the shares to 4.38
dirhams from 4.79 dirhams to reflect &#8220;lower earnings
expectations.&#8221; The stock dropped 1.5 percent, the most in a
week, to close at 3.25 dirhams in Dubai today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emirates NBD, 56 percent owned by the Dubai government,
reported a 59 percent decline in third-quarter profit to 175
million dirhams as loan-loss provisions rose. The bank&#8217;s ratio
of non-performing loans to total loans will rise to as much as
14 percent by the end of the year and advance by 1 percentage
point annually over the next two years, it said in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank is aiming to sell an Islamic bond this month,
Chief Executive Officer Rick Pudner said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fitch Ratings placed Emirates NBD&#8217;s credit rating on notice
in October for a possible downgrade on concern that a rise in
bad loans due to a weak property market and the impact of a
slowing global economy will affect the bank&#8217;s outlook. Fitch
rates the company A+, the fifth-highest investment grade, while
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service rates the bank A3, the fourth-lowest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Bank of America
Corp. (BAC) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) are among 22 financial firms
that received top marks today as the best workplaces for
lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three banks were among 207 U.S. companies that offer
health insurance covering medical services for transgender
employees seeking sexual reassignment, according to the 10th
annual Corporate Equality Index from the Human Rights Campaign
Foundation, a nonprofit that backs civil rights for lesbian,
gay, bisexual and transgender individuals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial firms outperformed most other industries in
adopting and enforcing non-discrimination policies, offering
health insurance for same-sex partners and recruiting and
retaining lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees,
according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This rating reflects equal health-care coverage for all
LGBT employees and their families, including full parity for
domestic partner benefits not only in basic medical coverage,
but in dependent care, retirement and other benefits that affect
families&#8217; financial and medical well-being,&#8221; Joe Solmonese,
president of the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, said in the
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AmEx, Google &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Human Rights Campaign gave 88 Fortune 500 companies
scores of 100 percent and the designation as the &#8220;Best Places
to Work for LGBT Equality.&#8221; Among the 190 companies that
received perfect scores are financial firms including American
Express Co., (AXP) Citigroup Inc. (C) and Morgan Stanley. (MS) Google Inc.,
Ford Motor Corp. and Gap Inc. (GPS) also received top marks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is one of nine companies to achieve the highest
rating for 10 straight years, along with Aetna Inc. (AET), Alcatel-
Lucent, American Airlines parent AMR Corp. (AMR), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Eastman
Kodak Co. (EK), Nike Inc. (NKE), Replacements Ltd. and Xerox Corp. (XRX),
according to Paul Guequierre, a foundation spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2012 index ranked 850 firms. More than half of
companies in the Fortune 500 submitted surveys voluntarily and
the rest were rated based on publicly available data, according
to the foundation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NYSE Euronext, owner of the New York Stock Exchange, and
Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ), which runs the Nasdaq Stock Market, were
among firms with the lowest scores at 15 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the low score reflects the fact that we were
not aware of the survey&#8221; and that NYSE didn&#8217;t give data to the
foundation, Richard Adamonis, a spokesman for NYSE Euronext (NYX),
said in an e-mail. &#8220;We have a diverse workforce and support
many programs that are oriented to the LGBT community including
domestic partner benefits and LGBT resource group, among
others.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wayne Lee, a spokesman for New York-based Nasdaq, didn&#8217;t
immediately return phone and e-mail messages seeking comment on
the survey results. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the biggest computer services provider, agreed to buy
DemandTec Inc. (DMAN) for $440 million, adding Internet-based tools to
help businesses adjust promotions based on buying patterns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The all-cash transaction amounts to $13.20 a share, and is
expected to close in the first quarter of 2012, Armonk, New
York-based IBM said today in a statement. That&#8217;s 57 percent
higher than DemandTec&#8217;s closing price yesterday. IBM said last
year it plans to spend about $20 billion on acquisitions through
2015, as it expands offerings to business customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchase is IBM&#8217;s biggest since the takeover of
analytics-technology provider Netezza Corp. last year for about
$1.7 billion. DemandTec will extend IBM&#8217;s Smarter Commerce
initiative, allowing companies to quickly adjust prices,
promotions and other marketing efforts by analyzing online and
in-store buying trends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;DemandTec assets could be a good fit,&#8221; Mark Moskowitz,
an analyst at JPMorgan  Chase Co. with an &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating
on IBM shares, said in a note to clients today. &#8220;DemandTec is
another example of IBM finding quality assets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM fell 1.3 percent to $191.58 at the close in New York.
DemandTec jumped 56 percent to $13.15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is paying a premium of 72 percent compared with the 20-
day trading average price before the announcement. The average
premium of 52 acquisitions of decision-support software
companies in the U.S. was 45 percent in the past five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DemandTec, based in San Mateo, California, employs more
than 350 people and has about 450 customers worldwide, including
Best Buy Co., ConAgra Foods Inc. and Target Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall market for Smarter Commerce software is worth
$20 billion, IBM estimates. The company spent $2.5 billion on
three Internet commerce acquisitions last year, buying Sterling
Commerce, Coremetrics Inc. and Unica Corp. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, persuaded a Pennsylvania appeals court to review an
$8.6 million punitive-damages award to a woman who blamed her
cancer on the company&#8217;s menopause drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pennsylvania Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments by
Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth unit that a judge erred in allowing a
Philadelphia jury to award punishment damages to Mary Daniel, a
former bank manager from Arkansas who sued the drugmaker
alleging its Prempro pills caused her breast cancer. Jurors also
awarded Daniel more than $1.6 million in compensatory damages on
her claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 6 million women took Prempro and related
menopause drugs to treat symptoms such as hot flashes and mood
swings before a 2002 study highlighted their links to cancer.
Wyeth&#8217;s sales of the medicines, which are still on the market,
topped $2 billion before the release of the Women&#8217;s Health
Initiative, a National Institutes of Health-sponsored study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The company is pleased the Pennsylvania Supreme Court
will hear the company&#8217;s appeal regarding whether punitive
damages are warranted,&#8221; Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said
in an e-mailed statement today. &#8220;The company has said all along
that Wyeth acted responsibly&#8221; in its handling of the drug, he
added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Premarin,
Wyeth&#8217;s estrogen-based drug, with progestin-laden Provera, made
by Pfizer&#8217;s Upjohn unit, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth
combined the two hormones in its Prempro pill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prempro Scorecard &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth and Pharmacia  Upjohn units have lost 10
out of the 18 Prempro cases that juries have considered since
trials began in 2006. The most recent verdict came earlier this
week when a Philadelphia jury awarded three women more than
$72 million in damages on their claims over the drugmaker&#8217;s
hormone-replacement medications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker has gotten some of those verdicts thrown out
after trial or had the awards reduced. It resolved some of the
verdicts through settlements, while other decisions are on
appeal. It also has persuaded some judges to throw cases out
before trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Daniel&#8217;s case, jurors found Wyeth&#8217;s Prempro and Premarin
drugs were a cause of the woman&#8217;s cancer and awarded her a total
of $10.2 million in damages. A judge in the case later threw out
of the award. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Award Reinstated &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, a lower Pennsylvania appeals court
reinstated Daniel&#8217;s jury award after finding the judge in the
case didn&#8217;t err in refusing to give a drugmaker a new trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state&#8217;s highest appellate court agreed Dec. 5 to review
whether Daniel was entitled to receive punitive damages for a
product that had been approved by federal regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased the court declined to consider any issue
relating to Wyeth&#8217;s negligence in causing her breast cancer or
Mrs. Daniel&#8217;s compensatory award,&#8221; Zoe Littlepage, one of the
woman&#8217;s lawyers, said in an e-mailed statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Daniel v. Wyeth, 040602368, Court of Common
Pleas (Philadelphia). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP, the
Netherlands&#8217; biggest retirement fund, sued JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM),
alleging violations of securities laws and fraud involving sales
of residential mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit, filed in New York state court in Manhattan
yesterday, accused the New York-based bank of negligent
misrepresentation, alleging the sales were based on false and
misleading statements. The damages should be determined at
trial, according to the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;ABP purchased securities that were far riskier than had
been represented, backed by mortgage loans worth significantly
less than had been represented and that had been made by
borrowers who were much less creditworthy than had been
represented,&#8221; Stichting Pensioenfonds said in the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined
comment about the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Heerlen, Netherlands-based pension fund also sued
Deutsche Bank AG over similar allegations in New York State
Supreme Court in September. Stichting serves as the pension fund
for Dutch public educational and government workers and has more
than 250 billion euros ($332.8 billion) in assets under
management, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP v. JPMorgan Chase

&lt;p&gt;Global natural gas, oil and nuclear
consumption will rise 32 percent during the next three decades
as population growth drives fuel demand and environmental
restrictions reduce coal use for the first time since the 18th
century, Exxon (XOM) Mobil Corp. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India will lead the growth as energy use there more than
doubles by 2040, Exxon said today in the long-term outlook it
publishes annually. Africa, Latin America and the Middle East
also will see increases in energy demand, while fuel consumption
will decline in the U.S. and Europe, according to the forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuclear power&#8217;s contribution to the world&#8217;s energy supply
will almost double by 2040, Irving, Texas-based Exxon said.
Natural-gas use will rise 62 percent, displacing coal as the
second-largest fuel supply behind crude oil. Coal consumption
will drop 6 percent, the first decline in demand for the fuel
since the start of the Industrial Revolution in the 1700s, said
William Colton, Exxon&#8217;s vice president of strategic planning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Coal has been the fastest growing major fuel in the world
over the past decade, and will continue to surprise to the
upside to power the world&#8217;s largest and fastest growing
economies,&#8221; Vic Svec, senior vice president of investor
relations at St Louis-based Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU), the largest
U.S. coal producer said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The base year for the demand estimates was 2010. Exxon
compiles the outlook annually to guide long-term investment
decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renewables Quadrupling &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand for renewable energy will more than quadruple by
2040, the report said. Oil, gas and coal will comprise 78
percent of global fuel supplies in 2040, according to the
report. Biomass, hydroelectric and renewables such as wind and
solar will contribute 15 percent of supplies. Nuclear will meet
about 8 percent of demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude will continue to be the dominant source of
transportation fuels in 2040, accounting for 89 percent of the
market, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The scale of the challenge is enormous and requires an
integrated set of solutions and the pursuit of all economic
options,&#8221; Rex Tillerson, Exxon&#8217;s chairman and chief executive
officer, said in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon employs a team of economists, analysts and engineers
that assemble the long-term world energy outlook every year. The
company has been compiling the forecast for more than 50 years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China National Petroleum Corp. will

&lt;p&gt;CNPC is working with Shell on a project in central China to
develop shale gas, its president Zhou Jiping told reporters
today in Doha, Qatar. The company has already made shale gas
discoveries and it needs more time to develop them, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The tectonic movement in China is even stronger than in
the U.S., and it&#8217;s making the structure more complex,&#8221; he said.
China has more potential gas resources than the U.S., according
to his estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese gas shale development will be more complex than in
the U.S. because of a different geological formation, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. researchers gained access to a
database of 2.4 million chemical formulas and diagrams that
International Business Machine Corp. (IBM) culled from 24 years&#8217; worth
of patent applications and medical journals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The catalogue of compounds will be housed at the National
Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. Scientists can use
the data to identify new candidates for drug development or new
uses for existing drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The applications are very wide reaching, from life
sciences to chemicals, petroleum, to food, to health,&#8221; said
Chris Moore, a partner and vice president in Armonk, New York-
based IBM&#8217;s global life sciences division, in a telephone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NIH has made development of drugs for rare diseases
such as sickle cell anemia a priority since Francis Collins
became director of the $31 billion research agency in 2009.
Collins has asked Congress to create a new institute for drug
development and pressed manufacturers to open catalogs of
abandoned compounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider,
created the database by &#8220;Watson-type technology,&#8221; Moore said,
referring to the supercomputer that beat human competitors on
the game show &#8216;Jeopardy.&#8217; The data was extracted from about 4.7
million U.S., European and United Nations patents and 11 million
biomedical journal abstracts from 1976 to 2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers can search the database for free. IBM plans to
sell a product that will produce more sophisticated analysis of
the database that can tell customers who is conducting research
on specific therapies, Moore said. He wouldn&#8217;t disclose the
price. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. is seeking to hire a
television executive to develop original shows as part of a
drive to expand its Xbox Live game and video service, according
to people with knowledge of the company&#8217;s plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has hired Tom Schneider, a partner at Stratis
LLC, to conduct the search, said the people, who weren&#8217;t
authorized to speak publicly. Two former NBC executives, Marc Graboff and Jeff Gaspin, have been approached, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, is trying to turn
the Xbox console into an entertainment hub, rather than mostly a
game machine. The company, the world&#8217;s largest software
producer, is introducing a TV service with programs from almost
40 TV and entertainment suppliers to draw more users to the Web-
enabled product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Original programming would help Microsoft differentiate the
service from those offered by competitors including Apple Inc.
and Google Inc. (GOOG) Some of the Xbox&#8217;s top-selling games were
created by Microsoft and the company is looking to replicate
that success with program it develops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TV service will include content from partners like Time
Warner Inc. (TWX)&#8217;s HBO, Sony Corp.&#8217;s Crackle and the BBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is only interested in making a hire if it can
find the right person and it&#8217;s possible no one will be chosen
for the job, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaspin was chairman of NBC Universal TV Entertainment. He
stepped down after Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) took control of NBC in January.
Graboff, president of west coast business operations for NBC
Entertainment, announced plans to leave last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Dennis, a Microsoft spokesman, declined to comment.
Schneider didn&#8217;t respond to phone and e-mail requests for

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp., the second-largest (CVX)
U.S. oil company, may need to drill a relief well at its $3.6
billion Frade project in deep water off Brazil&#8217;s coast as part
of measures to counter a spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cementing at the Frade well that leaked last month
currently &#8220;doesn&#8217;t guarantee 100 percent efficiency,&#8221; Magda Chambriard, a director at the regulator known as ANP, told
reporters today in Rio de Janeiro. Drilling a relief well is
&#8220;one possibility&#8221; if Chevron doesn&#8217;t convince ANP that the
cementing is solidly stuck to the ground, Chambriard said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decision on the cementing may be reached as early as next
week, Chambriard said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron may have to pay as much as 350 million reais
($193.5 million) in fines and damages for the Nov. 7 leak of at
least 2,400 barrels of crude at the Frade project off the coast
of Rio de Janeiro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil has tightened safety conditions at oil projects
following the spill at BP Plc&#8217;s Macondo well in the Gulf of
Mexico last year, Chambriard said. The agency has shut 11
drilling rigs and production platforms over the past year
because of safety concerns, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our analysis so far indicates that the cement plugs have
been properly placed,&#8221; Scott Walker, a spokesman for San Ramon,
California-based Chevron, said in an e-mailed response to
questions today. &#8220;Chevron will continue to discuss this and
other issues with regulators and hopes to get their approval
soon to proceed with the proposed well abandonment plan,&#8221;
Walker said in the e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A relief well off of Brazil&#8217;s coast will cost at least $50
million, according to Hernani Chavez a former exploration and
production manager at Petroleo Brasileiro SA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Cementing the well should be totally sufficient,&#8221; Chavez
said in a telephone interview from Rio de Janeiro today. &#8220;At
Macondo, a relief well was necessary because they were unable to
halt the flow, the situation was completely different.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Matt Robinson" date="Dec 09, 2011 11:22 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-12-09/goldman-sachs-is-said-to-start-offering-fdic-backed-cds-linked-to-equities.html"><headline>Goldman Said to Plan CDs Tied to Equities</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) plans to
issue four certificates of deposit linked to stocks as record
low interest rates drive investor demand for the potentially
higher-yielding CDs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structured CDs are the bank&#8217;s first and are set to
price at the end of the month, said a person with knowledge of
the offerings who declined to be identified because terms aren&#8217;t
set. One four-year CD is linked to changes in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average, with annual returns at a minimum of about
0.5 percent and a possible maximum of 24 percent, according to a
preliminary sales document. That compares with the average yield
of 1.15 percent for a three-year, fixed-rate deposit,
Bankrate.com data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand for CDs tied to assets such as equities, commodities
and exchange-traded funds has soared as the Federal Reserve has
held its benchmark rate at zero to 0.25 percent since 2008. Bank
revenue from the investments has more than tripled to $99 per
million dollars in retail deposits in October from $30 in
January, according to Kehrer-LIMRA Research compiled from
approximately 30 lenders, including Wells Fargo  Co. and
SunTrust Banks Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market-linked or structured CD market has had &#8220;healthy
growth,&#8221; said Glenn Lotenberg, a managing director at Incapital
LLC in Boca Raton, Florida, which expects to sell $2.5 billion
of structured CDs this year, from $2 billion in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data on the market is incomplete as the investments aren&#8217;t
registered by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. doesn&#8217;t track market-linked
deposits separately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks Benefit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks benefit from issuing structured CDs, which the FDIC
insures up to $250,000, by raising deposits at lower funding
levels and collecting commissions, said Tim Bonacci of CD
Funding Securities LLC, who&#8217;s helped about 30 financial
institutions set up their own proprietary CD business since
2005. The average fee on a five-year deposit is about 3 percent,
Bonacci said in an interview last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which was the most profitable securities
firm in Wall Street history before it converted to a bank in
2008 after the collapse of smaller rival Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc., had $41.8 billion in deposits in the third
quarter. That&#8217;s up from $38.6 billion at the end of 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four-year CD tracks the monthly percentage change in
the Dow, with gains capped at 1.5 percent to 2 percent and no
floor on the declines. That means if the Dow advanced 5 percent,
the monthly return would be recorded as no more than 2 percent,
while a drop of the same amount would be taken in full. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks create market-linked CDs by combining zero-coupon
bonds with derivatives to offer customized bets to investors.
Derivatives are contracts whose value is derived from stocks,
bonds, currencies and commodities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. plans to
provide funding for a hedge fund being started by Todd Edgar, a
former commodities trader at Barclays Plc, said two people with
knowledge of the preparations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will make an investment through a so-called
seeding fund that the New York-based firm started this year
after raising money for it from pension funds and wealthy
individuals, the person said. Edgar will get $150 million to
$200 million from Goldman Sachs in return for a cut of the fees
his hedge fund generates, said the people who declined to be
identified because the negotiations are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Congress last year restricted banks&#8217; investments
in hedge funds through the so-called Volcker rule after
lawmakers concluded that financial institutions shouldn&#8217;t be
using federally backed deposits for wagers on markets. The
Goldman Sachs seeding fund is permitted under the law because it
uses client money rather than the firm&#8217;s capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edgar and his team of commodities traders left Barclays (BARC) in
the third quarter of this year. His fund will trade futures and
options on metals based on the firm&#8217;s views of global economic
trends, the people said. The fund will be based in New York and
plans to start trading next year, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joanna Carss, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in London,
and Edgar declined to comment. He joined Barclays, Britain&#8217;s
second-largest bank by assets, from JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) in
2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackstone Group &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some hedge funds are turning to firms such as Goldman Sachs
and Blackstone Group LP (BX) that provide startup financing because
pension funds and other investors have shied away from smaller
money managers since the credit crisis in 2008. Two-thirds of
the asset growth for hedge funds since 2009 has been at firms
managing more than $5 billion, according to Chicago-based Hedge
Fund Research Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackstone, the world&#8217;s largest private-equity firm,
invests in hedge funds for a slice of a manager&#8217;s fees and an
equity stake in the company. Hedge funds, private pools that try
to make money whether markets are rising or falling, typically
charge clients 2 percent of assets managed and 20 percent of any
investment gains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edgar&#8217;s fund will be the second to receive an investment
from Goldman Sachs this year. In September, Goldman Sachs
invested $100 million in New York-based Palestra Capital
Management LLC, a fund focused on stocks run by Jeremy Schiffman
and Andrew Immerman, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has received about $600 million from clients
to invest in startup hedge funds with plans to raise more money,
the person said. Goldman Sachs&#8217;s hedge-fund investment effort is
being led by two executives, Kent Clark in New York and Ali Raissi in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm shut an earlier seeding fund in 2008, a year when
hedge funds lost 20 percent on average after the collapse of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jon Corzine and four other former
executives of bankrupt MF Global Holdings Ltd. were sued by a
group of commodity traders seeking damages for lost funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henning-Carey Proprietary Trading LLC, a clearing firm and
member of CME Group Inc. (CME), joined with eight traders in seeking
recovery of an unaccounted-for $1.2 billion in customer funds at
the brokerage unit MF Global Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Defendants were responsible for insuring that the
plaintiffs&#8217; property was properly segregated and accounted
for,&#8221; the traders said in the complaint filed yesterday in
federal court in Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit is one of several filed by brokerage customers and
former employees against Corzine, MF Global executives or the
company since it filed for bankruptcy protection on Oct. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corzine told the House Agriculture Committee at a hearing
in Washington yesterday that he &#8220;would never have intended&#8221;
transfers from segregated accounts and had teams in place at the
firm to ensure they didn&#8217;t occur. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wouldn&#8217;t say if he and other executives were willing to
share customers&#8217; losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corzine and his executives were responsible for looking
after customers&#8217; segregated accounts, yet the money went missing
as the company tried to salvage its business after &#8220;engaging in
highly leveraged and speculative trading in foreign sovereign
bonds,&#8221; the traders claimed in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Levander, an attorney for Corzine, didn&#8217;t respond to
an e-mail yesterday seeking comment on the traders&#8217; allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs&#8217; accounts were frozen along with about
38,000 others on Oct. 31, after &#8220;apparent segregation
violations,&#8221; making it impossible for customers to access their
accounts or the assets in them, the plaintiffs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Henning-Carey Proprietary Trading LLC v.
Corzine, 11-cv-08717, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
Illinois (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julius Baer, Falcon Sued by Trustee for Madoff-Related Funds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER), the 121-year-old Swiss wealth
manager, and Falcon Private Bank Ltd. were sued by the trustee
liquidating Bernard Madoff&#8217;s former investment firm who is
seeking to recover $76 million in redemptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irving Picard filed two lawsuits yesterday in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan for a return of funds that were
transferred to the two Swiss banks by investors in Fairfield
Sentry Ltd., a feeder fund for Madoff&#8217;s firm. The trustee seeks
about $37 million from Julius Baer and about $39 million from
Falcon, a Zurich-based private bank owned by the government of
Abu Dhabi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We cannot comment on pending legal cases,&#8221; said Jan
Vonder Muehll, a Zurich-based spokesman for Julius Baer, which
manages 166 billion Swiss francs ($179 billion) for private
clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010, the liquidators of the Fairfield funds started
separate litigation against Julius Baer, the bank said in its
2010 annual report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, who pleaded guilty to fraud charges, is serving 150
years in prison for the largest Ponzi scheme in U.S. history.
Investors lost about $19 billion in principal, Picard has said.
Fairfield is in liquidation in the British Virgin Islands.
Picard has filed similar lawsuits to recover investments taken
out of Madoff&#8217;s firm before the fraud was exposed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irene Franco, a spokeswoman for Falcon, said the firm
hasn&#8217;t been informed about the claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Picard v. Bank Julius Baer  Co., 11-2922,
and Picard v. Falcon Private Bank, 11-2923, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stichting Pensioenfonds Sues JPMorgan Chase Over Securities &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP, the Netherlands&#8217; biggest
retirement fund, sued JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), alleging violations
of securities laws and fraud involving sales of residential
mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit, filed in New York state court in Manhattan Dec.
7, accused the New York-based bank of negligent
misrepresentation, alleging the sales were based on false and
misleading statements. Damages should be determined at trial,
according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;ABP purchased securities that were far riskier than had
been represented, backed by mortgage loans worth significantly
less than had been represented and that had been made by
borrowers who were much less creditworthy than had been
represented,&#8221; ABP said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined
to comment about the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Heerlen, Netherlands-based pension fund sued Deutsche
Bank AG over similar allegations in New York State Supreme Court
in September. ABP serves as the pension fund for Dutch public
educational and government workers and has more than 250 billion
euros ($332.8 billion) in assets under management, according to
the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP v. JPMorgan Chase 
Co., 653383/2011, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC Allowed by Judge to Join JPMorgan in Madoff Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) can join JPMorgan Chase  Co. and UBS AG
in appeals of decisions dismissing most of the lawsuits brought
by the trustee liquidating Bernard L. Madoff Investment
Securities Inc., a judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in July dismissed most of
the Madoff trustee&#8217;s $9 billion suit against London-based HSBC.
In November, U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon threw out most
of the trustee&#8217;s $19 billion suit against New York-based
JPMorgan and dismissed most of the suit against UBS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two judges ruled on the same grounds, accepting the
banks&#8217; arguments that the claims underlying the trustee&#8217;s suits
could only be brought by individual Madoff creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irving Picard, the Madoff trustee, couldn&#8217;t appeal
immediately because neither judge dismissed all of the suits. To
lift the bar to appeal, McMahon previously entered a final
judgment in the JPMorgan case, allowing Picard to seek a review
by a U.S. Court of Appeals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, at the request of HSBC, Rakoff did the same by
entering a final dismissal judgment so Picard can appeal. HSBC
said it wanted to have its case heard at the same time as
JPMorgan&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HSBC case lacked &#8220;factors that might lead the court to
deny such relief&#8221; in Picard&#8217;s suit against New York Mets owners
Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz, Rakoff said. In September, Rakoff
knocked out about $700 million of the $1 billion in claims in
the Wilpon case and scheduled a jury trial for March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rakoff said he is still considering whether to allow Picard
to appeal his decision that the trustee can only sue to recover
fictitious profits that customers took out within two years of
the Madoff firm&#8217;s bankruptcy. Picard sought to go back six years
in disgorging bogus profits from the Ponzi scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard argued in court papers that Rakoff should allow an
immediate appeal because another district judge disagreed with
Rakoff&#8217;s conclusion that suits can only look back two years.
Until the question on timing is resolved, hundreds of suits by
the trustee against customers are in limbo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HSBC suit in U.S. District Court is Picard v. HSBC Bank
Plc, 11-763, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). The UBS suit in district court is Picard v. UBS AG (UBSN),
11-04213, in the same court. The JPMorgan lawsuit in district
court is Picard v. JPMorgan Chase  Co., 11-00913, in the same
court. The JPMorgan lawsuit in bankruptcy court was Picard v.
JPMorgan Chase  Co., 10-04932, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). The Wilpon suit in district
court is Picard v. Katz, 11-03605, U.S. District Court, Southern
District New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Madoff liquidation case is Securities Investor
Protection Corp. v. Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities
Inc., 08-01789, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). The criminal case is U.S. v. Madoff, 09-

&lt;p&gt;Samsung Loses Bid to Block Apple IPhone 4S Sales in France &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) failed to win a court order
blocking Apple Inc. (AAPL) from selling its newest smartphone, the
iPhone 4S, in France. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Paris court rejected Samsung&#8217;s request for an emergency
order against Apple while it considers the South Korean
company&#8217;s patent-infringement claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung, the biggest maker of smartphones, sought to block
sales of the new handset in France, Italy and the U.K. days
after it was unveiled in October, arguing Apple violated its
wireless-communications patents. Suwon, South Korea-based
Samsung sued in Paris in July over earlier versions of the
iPhone and Apple&#8217;s iPad tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The disproportionate character of the ban sought by
Samsung against Apple is clear,&#8221; Judge Marie-Christine
Courboulay said in the decision yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Paris court ruled Samsung must pay Apple 100,000 euros
($134,100) for legal fees while denying Apple&#8217;s request for
damages. Samsung&#8217;s claim wasn&#8217;t &#8220;abusive&#8221; and the company&#8217;s
infringement claims can move forward as a regular lawsuit,
Courboulay said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florence Catel, a Samsung spokeswoman in Paris, declined to
comment on the decision. Calls to Apple&#8217;s office in London for
comment weren&#8217;t immediately returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung has been locked in a global legal battle with Apple
since the Cupertino, California-based company claimed in an
April suit that Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy devices copied the iPad and
iPhone. Samsung was the world&#8217;s biggest maker of smartphones in
the last quarter, while Apple dominates the tablet market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Education Management Should Face Recruitment Suit, U.S. Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education Management Corp. (EDMC), the second-largest U.S. for-
profit college chain, should be forced to defend a lawsuit
alleging its recruiting policies helped the company wrongfully
secure more than $11 billion in student aid, government lawyers
said in a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. officials have properly outlined claims that
Pittsburgh-based Education Management created an illegal
compensation system for admission recruiters to ensure a steady
flow of students who receive government aid to pay college
expenses, Justice Department attorneys said in the filing made
public yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;EDMC&#8217;s unlawful compensation scheme emanates from the
highest levels of the corporation and represents a conscious
effort to do exactly what&#8221; federal regulations prohibit in
terms of providing bonuses to recruiters, the government said in
the filing in federal court in Pittsburgh opposing the firm&#8217;s
request to have the case thrown out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For-profit colleges have been under scrutiny by Congress,
state lawmakers and attorneys general who are investigating
sales practices and students&#8217; debt loads. Eleven states and the
District of Columbia joined the U.S. as plaintiffs in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government, which intervened in suits filed by two EDMC
whistleblowers, contends the company systematically violated
federal law by paying recruiters based on their success in
persuading prospective students to enroll in the for-profit
school. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EDMC argued in court filings that prosecutors haven&#8217;t
properly stated claims supporting allegations that the
institution started a companywide campaign to defraud the
government and violate Department of Education regulations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are reviewing the governments&#8217; responses to EDMC&#8217;s
motion to have the court dismiss this lawsuit, and we will have
an opportunity to file a reply with the court,&#8221; Bonnie
Campbell, a legal adviser to the company, said in an e-mailed
statement. &#8220;Based on what we have seen, we continue to believe
the case should be dismissed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Education Management Corp., 07-00461,
U.S. District Court, Western District of Pennsylvania
(Pittsburgh). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Wins Review of Punitive-Damages Award in Prempro Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, persuaded a
Pennsylvania appeals court to review an $8.6 million punitive-
damages award to a woman who blamed her cancer on the company&#8217;s
menopause drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pennsylvania Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments by
Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth unit that a judge erred in letting a Philadelphia
jury award punishment damages to Mary Daniel, a former bank
manager from Arkansas who sued the drugmaker alleging its
Prempro pills caused her breast cancer. Jurors also awarded
Daniel more than $1.6 million in compensatory damages on her
claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 6 million women took Prempro and related
menopause drugs to treat symptoms such as hot flashes and mood
swings before a 2002 study highlighted their links to cancer.
Wyeth&#8217;s sales of the medicines, which are still on the market,
topped $2 billion before the release of the Women&#8217;s Health
Initiative, a National Institutes of Health-sponsored study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The company is pleased the Pennsylvania Supreme Court
will hear the company&#8217;s appeal regarding whether punitive
damages are warranted,&#8221; Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said
in an e-mailed statement yesterday. &#8220;The company has said all
along that Wyeth acted responsibly&#8221; in its handling of the
drug, he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Premarin,
Wyeth&#8217;s estrogen-based drug, with progestin-laden Provera, made
by Pfizer&#8217;s Upjohn unit, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth
combined the two hormones in its Prempro pill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth and Pharmacia  Upjohn units have lost 10 of
the 18 Prempro cases that juries have considered since trials
began in 2006. The most recent verdict came this week when a
Philadelphia jury awarded three women more than $72 million in
damages on their claims over the drugmaker&#8217;s hormone-replacement
medications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased the court declined to consider any issue
relating to Wyeth&#8217;s negligence in causing her breast cancer or
Mrs. Daniel&#8217;s compensatory award,&#8221; Zoe Littlepage, one of the
woman&#8217;s lawyers, said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Daniel v. Wyeth, 040602368, Court of Common
Pleas (Philadelphia). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Oddball&#8217; Hedge-Fund Friend Chose Stocks, Sidhu Tells Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rupinder Sidhu, who is accused of insider trading, said he
had no idea stock tips from his &#8220;eccentric&#8221; friend at hedge
fund AKO Capital LLP were based on confidential information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors allege AKO trader Anjam Ahmad told Sidhu when
the fund was about to place large buy or sell orders so Sidhu
could benefit from the effect on the shares. The pair split
profits of about 500,000 pounds ($783,500) from spread bets on
companies including Julius Baer Group Ltd., Swatch Group AG (UHR) and
Michael Page International Plc (MPI) between June and August 2009, the
U.K. Financial Services Authority said in a London trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know about any AKO orders,&#8221; Sidhu testified
yesterday. &#8220;I was basing my trades on Ahmad&#8217;s decisions and his
rationale.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sidhu denies 23 counts of insider trading and one money-
laundering charge for which he&#8217;s on trial. The 40-year-old
management consultant from Osterley, West London, admitted
contacting Ahmad using unregistered mobile phones and instant-
messaging accounts under false names to discuss trades. In one
MSN Messenger conversation, they made a coded reference to a
potential purchase as a &#8220;party.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sidhu told jurors this was because he wanted to keep the
spread betting secret from his family, who banned the practice
after he racked up heavy trading losses in 2008. Ahmad told
Sidhu his contract with AKO prevented him from trading for
himself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahmad, a former equity strategist at Citigroup Inc. (C), was a
gifted mathematician who was known for being &#8220;quirky and
eccentric&#8221; and &#8220;an oddball,&#8221; Sidhu said in testimony Dec. 7.
They had been friends since secondary school and Sidhu regularly
sought his advice on trading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Settles Prempro Case After Losing $72.6 Million Verdict &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, agreed to
settle claims that its menopause drugs caused cancer in three
women who won a $72.6 million jury award earlier this week, a
lawyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based company agreed to resolve claims by
Susan Elfont, Bernadette Kalenkoski and Judy Mulderig that
hormone-replacement drugs made by two Pfizer units caused their
breast cancer, Ted Meadows, a lawyer for the women, said in an
interview yesterday. A Philadelphia jury awarded the three women
$72.6 million in compensatory damages on Dec. 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re just glad to be able to go on with their lives,&#8221;
said Meadows, who declined to disclose the amounts of the
settlements because they are confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accord comes a day before jurors were to begin hearing
testimony in a second phase of the case. The panel would have
been asked to decide whether Pfizer should face punitive damages
over its handling of the menopause drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The parties have entered into a mutual agreement to
resolve this case under confidential terms,&#8221; Chris Loder, a
Pfizer spokesman, said in a telephone interview. The earlier
verdict will be set aside as part of the settlement, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 6 million women took Prempro and related
menopause drugs to treat symptoms such as hot flashes and mood
swings before a 2002 study highlighted their links to cancer.
Wyeth&#8217;s sales of the medicines, which are still on the market,
topped $2 billion before the release of the Women&#8217;s Health
Initiative, a National Institutes of Health-sponsored study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Philadelphia case that settled is Elfont v. Wyeth
Pharmaceuticals Inc., 00924, Jury Term 2004, Philadelphia Court
of Common Pleas (Philadelphia). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Garrett Bauer Pleads Guilty to Trading on Stolen Merger Tips &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garrett Bauer, a New York stock trader, pleaded guilty to
his role in an insider-trading scheme that the U.S. says
generated $37 million in illegal profits by relying on corporate
merger tips stolen from four law firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bauer, 44, joined middleman Kenneth T. Robinson and
attorney Matthew H. Kluger in using nonpublic data to trade
ahead of more than 30 corporate transactions over 17 years, he
admitted in federal court in Newark, New Jersey. Robinson, who
cooperated with prosecutors, pleaded guilty in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In charging the men in April, prosecutors said the scheme
involved companies such as Sun Microsystems Inc., 3Com Corp. and
Acxiom Corp. They said Bauer made more than $30 million on the
scheme, while Robinson earned more than $875,000 and Kluger more
than $500,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;After taking the lion&#8217;s share of the $37 million in
profits, Bauer now faces punishment for conduct that undermines
the fairness of our financial markets and the public&#8217;s trust in
the safety of its investments,&#8221; U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said
in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bauer admitted securities fraud, conspiracy to commit
securities fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and
obstruction of justice. He faces as many as 20 years in prison
on the fraud and obstruction counts when he is sentenced March
13. He forfeited cash and property worth more than $23 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bauer, who is free on $4 million bail, regrets his actions
and has been giving lectures to students and traders about
insider trading, said his attorney Michael Bachner. He has
spoken at business schools, law schools, churches and synagogues
to audiences ranging from 20 to 200 people, Bachner said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are U.S. v. Bauer, 11-mj-03536, and U.S. v.
Robinson, 11-cr-00223, U.S. District Court, District of New
Jersey (Newark). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo to Pay $148 Million in Muni Bid-Rigging Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) agreed to pay $148 million to settle
criminal charges and civil claims for conspiring to overcharge
state and local governments on investments, becoming the fourth
bank to enter a settlement in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal will resolve investigations into Wachovia Bank,
which Wells Fargo acquired in 2008, by U.S. agencies, including
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice
Department, as well as attorneys general in 26 states, the
Justice Department said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is the latest in a more than five-year
investigation into how Wall Street banks conspired with local-
government advisers to reap excessive fees on investments sold
to public agencies by rigging competitive auctions and carving
up the market among themselves. JPMorgan Chase  Co., UBS AG and
Bank of America Corp. (BAC) previously settled similar cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Wachovia won bids by playing an elaborate game of &#8216;you
scratch my back and I&#8217;ll scratch yours,&#8217; rather than engaging in
legitimate competition to win municipalities&#8217; business,&#8221; Robert
Khuzami, director of the SEC&#8217;s Division of Enforcement, said in
a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement by Wells Fargo will bring to $673 million
the amount that banks have paid to settle the case, some of
which is being returned to localities that were overcharged in
the scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, said the conduct was
by former employees of Wachovia before its acquisition. About
$59 million from the settlement will go to state attorneys
general, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Wells Fargo is pleased to have fully resolved this
investigation of Wachovia Bank,&#8221; the bank said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charges are connected to investment contracts that
states and cities bought with proceeds raised in the $3.7
trillion municipal-bond market, allowing them to earn a return
until the cash is needed for public-works projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KME, Halcor Lose EU Top Court Challenges of Antitrust Fines &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KME Group SpA (KME) and Greek metals processor Halcor SA (XAKO) lost
European Union top court appeals over cartel fines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The antitrust penalties against the companies should stand,
the EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg said in rulings yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KME appealed fines levied in two separate cartels in 2003
and in 2004, respectively. A lower EU court in 2009 rejected the
company&#8217;s first challenge to the 2003 fine of 39.8 million euros
($53.3 million). In 2004, KME was fined 67.1 million euros and
Halcor 9.16 million euros in another cartel. Halcor&#8217;s fine was
cut to 8.25 million euros by a lower EU court in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission, the 27-nation EU&#8217;s antitrust
regulator, fined three companies in 2003, including Outokumpu
Oyj (OUT1V) and Wieland-Werke AG, a total of 79 million euros for a
cartel between 1988 and 2001 in the market for copper tubes used
in air conditioning and refrigeration. A few months later, the
regulator levied a 222.3 million-euro penalty on companies
including KME and Halcor in the water, heating and gas tubes
market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s ruling confirms the lower court&#8217;s decision
which largely backed the EU antitrust authority, the Brussels-
based regulator said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halcor will examine the ruling and has already set aside 5
million euros to cover part of the fine, according to a filing
the company made to the Athens bourse. Francesco Giubilei, a
spokesman for Florence, Italy-based KME said he couldn&#8217;t comment
because it&#8217;s a national holiday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are: C-272/09 P, KME and Others v. European
Commission, C-389/10 P, KME Germany and Others v. Commission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) failed to win
a court order blocking Apple Inc. (AAPL) from selling its newest
smartphone, the iPhone 4S, in France. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Paris court rejected Samsung&#8217;s request for an emergency
order against Apple while it considers the South Korean
company&#8217;s patent-infringement claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung, the biggest maker of smartphones, sought to block
sales of the new handset in France, Italy and the U.K. days
after it was unveiled in October, arguing that Apple violated
its wireless-communications patents. Suwon, South Korea-based
Samsung sued in Paris in July over earlier versions of the
iPhone and Apple&#8217;s iPad tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The disproportionate character of the ban sought by
Samsung against Apple is clear,&#8221; Judge Marie-Christine
Courboulay said in yesterday&#8217;s decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Paris court ruled Samsung must pay Apple 100,000 euros
($134,100) for legal fees while denying Apple&#8217;s request for
damages. Samsung&#8217;s claim wasn&#8217;t &#8220;abusive&#8221; and the company&#8217;s
infringement claims can move forward as a regular lawsuit,
Courboulay said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florence Catel, a Samsung spokeswoman in Paris, declined to
comment on the decision. Calls to Apple&#8217;s office in London for
comment weren&#8217;t immediately returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung has been locked in a global legal battle with Apple
since the Cupertino, California-based company claimed in an
April suit that Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy devices copied the iPad and
iPhone. Samsung was the world&#8217;s biggest maker of smartphones in
the last quarter, while Apple dominates the tablet market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies have filed at least 30 lawsuits in 10
countries, and European Union regulators have started an
antitrust probe of the companies&#8217; use of smartphone patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Milan court will hold a hearing Dec. 16 concerning
Samsung&#8217;s Italian suit. In a Dec. 3 decision, a federal court in
San Jose, California, rejected Apple&#8217;s request to block
Samsung&#8217;s 4G smartphone and its Galaxy 10.1 tablet computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva&#8217;s Cephalon Wins Appeal Against Watson Over Fentora Copy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA)&#8217;s Cephalon unit won an
appeals court decision that prevents Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc.
from selling a generic copy of the painkiller Fentora until
2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in
Washington yesterday upheld the validity of a Cephalon patent on
Fentora and backed a lower-court ruling that Watson infringed
the patent. The appeals court posted a notice of the decision on
its website without a formal opinion explaining its findings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fentora is approved to relieve sudden episodes of cancer
pain in adults already taking opioids, or morphine-like drugs.
Cephalon has said its patent 6,264,981 that was upheld expires
in 2019 and is for a process of making the tablet dissolve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug generated $81 million in U.S. sales in the first
half, Cephalon said in August. Petach Tikva, Israel-based Teva
bought Cephalon in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Cephalon Inc. v. Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI),
09cv724, U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware
(Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DC Comics Loses Bid to Block Superloans Logo in New Zealand &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DC Comics lost its bid to ban the logo of a New Zealand
finance company for infringing its Superman trademarks, New
Zealand&#8217;s Dominion Post reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand&#8217;s intellectual property office said there was a
clear difference between Superman and Buck, the flying superhero
used by Wellington-based Superloans, according to the Dominion
Post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The office said Buck has a shield on his chest bearing a
dollar sign, and his holding money in his hand deviated from
Superman&#8217;s altruistic orientation, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DC Comics was ordered to pay Superloans&#8217; litigation costs,
according to the Dominion Post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hermes Infringement Complaint Leads to Indictment in Taiwan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hermes International (RMS)&#8217;s trademarks associated with is Birkin
handbag were found to have been infringed by the maker of the
canvas &#8220;Banane Taipei&#8221; bags, according to the Taipei Times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logos of the French luxury-goods company were copied and
placed on the Taiwan bags, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a complaint from Paris-based Hermes, Taipei&#8217;s
Intellectual Property Office rejected an application to register
the Banane Taipei logo and the products&#8217; two creators were
indicted for criminal trademark infringement, the Times said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banane Taipei bags became popular in Taiwan after actress
Barbie Hsu gave them away as gifts to guests at her wedding in
May, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Sanuki Udon&#8217; Noodle Trademarks Canceled by China&#8217;s IP Office &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s Intellectual Property Office canceled a trademark
for noodle products after a Japanese company complained, the
China Post reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Namchow Group lost the registration for &#8220;Sanuki Udon,&#8221;
which Japan&#8217;s Kabashima Co. had argued was a place name and
public property not entitled to trademark protection, according
to China Post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanuki udon noodles are a product of Japan&#8217;s Kagawa
Prefecture, and because of the ruling, the name can be used by
any maker of udon-type noodles from flour from the Sanuku region
of Kagawa, according to China Post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Namchow officials told the China Post they are discussing
whether to appeal the Intellectual Property Office&#8217;s ruling to
China&#8217;s Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti-Piracy Role Added to U.S. Trade Agency in Draft Bill &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. lawmakers unveiled draft legislation that would give
the International Trade Commission the lead role in fighting
foreign websites trafficking in illegal content and counterfeit
goods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The draft bill, released yesterday by Senator Ron Wyden, an
Oregon Democrat, and Representative Darrell Issa, a California
Republican, is meant as an alternative to Hollywood-backed anti-
piracy legislation under consideration by the House and Senate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those measures pit the movie and music industries, which
want a stronger crackdown on online piracy, against Google Inc. (GOOG),
Facebook Inc. and other Web companies that say the bills may
ensnare legitimate websites and threaten the growth of the U.S.
technology industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The draft bill released by Wyden and Issa, called the
Online Protection and Enforcement of Digital Trade Act, lets
U.S. intellectual-property owners petition the trade agency to
investigate foreign websites linked to piracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the bill, the commission may issue cease-and-desist
orders against foreign websites that &#8220;primarily&#8221; and
&#8220;willfully&#8221; engage in copyright infringement. Those orders
could be used to force U.S.-based payment and advertising
companies to stop providing services to such sites, according to
the draft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wyden-Issa proposal contrasts with Hollywood-backed
anti-piracy bills that were introduced this year and have
multiple co-sponsors from both parties. Those measures would let
the U.S. Justice Department seek court orders forcing Internet-
service providers, search engines, payment services and
advertising networks to block or cease business with foreign
websites linked to piracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hollywood-backed measure in the House, the Stop Online
Piracy Act, also would give intellectual-property owners,
through private action and in court, the ability to push U.S.
payment processors and online-advertising services to stop doing
business with foreign websites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representative Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican and chairman
of the House Judiciary Committee, has said he plans to hold a
committee vote before year-end on the Stop Online Piracy Act,
which he introduced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, Facebook and other Web companies said in a Nov. 15
letter that the House and Senate measures would create &#8220;new
uncertain liabilities&#8221; for Internet companies and asked
lawmakers to seek &#8220;more targeted ways&#8221; to combat &#8220;rogue&#8221;
websites in other countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NetCoalition, a technology-industry group representing
Google, Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) and EBay Inc., supports having the ITC
handle copyright and trademark-infringement cases against
foreign websites, Markham Erickson, the group&#8217;s executive
director, said in an interview this week. The Washington-based
group&#8217;s members include Bloomberg LP, the parent company of
Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studio executives have expressed concern the trade
commission isn&#8217;t equipped to take on enforcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alternative bill from Wyden and Issa is still in draft
form and may be introduced as legislation within a week,
Jennifer Hoelzer, a spokeswoman for Wyden, said in an interview.
The draft bill has been posted on a website to solicit comments
and feedback. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency has the power to block imports of products found
to infringe intellectual-property rights. It&#8217;s at the center of
patent battles over smartphone technology and is investigating
allegations of unfair trade practices by China in the solar-
panel industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola&#8217;s Secret Formula Finds New Home in Downtown Atlanta &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world&#8217;s largest maker of soft drinks,
moved its closely guarded formula from a bank vault to a tourist
attraction in downtown Atlanta, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recipe went from one of SunTrust Inc. (STI)&#8217;s banks to the
newly built &#8220;Vault of the Secret Formula&#8221; at the World of
Coca-Cola exhibit, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 125-year-old formula belonging to Atlanta-based Coca-
Cola had been housed at SunTrust since 1925, the newspaper
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the new vault will be visible to the public, its
size, security details and cost will be as closely guarded a
secret as the formula itself, the Journal-Constitution said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Bachelor&#8217; Producers Sue &#8216;Reality Steve&#8217; Over Program Spoilers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The producers of &#8220;The Bachelor&#8221; reality television
program sued the Texas-based operator of a &#8220;spoiler&#8221; website
for trying to disclose secrets about the program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Spoilers&#8221; are information that reveal a plot or
program&#8217;s outcome in advance of its conclusion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the complaint filed Dec. 6 in federal court in Los
Angeles, Burbank, California-based NZK Productions Inc. and
Horizon Alternative Television Inc. accused Stephen Carbone of
revealing &#8220;non-public information regarding events that
transpired on the Bachelor series episodes prior to their
broadcast.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Bachelor&#8221; and its spin-off &#8220;Bachelorette,&#8221; which
are broadcast on Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s ABC network, feature either a
male or female principal character who, over the course of the
series, selects a potential marriage partner from among 25
contestants selected by the producers. The identity of the
chosen person -- who is given the &#8220;final rose&#8221; -- isn&#8217;t
revealed until the final show of the series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint, Carbone has contacted
participants, casts and crew members of &#8220;The Bachelor&#8221; and
induced them to breach their confidentiality agreements. He then
allegedly posted the information on the RealitySteve.com
website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The producers claim Carbone offered at least one
participant $2,500 to reveal information about the show.
Although Carbone was sent a cease-and-desist letter in August,
and a second in November, he has continued to solicit
confidential information from participants in the program,
according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbone posted a notice on his website referring all
inquiries to his counsel, Brad Kizzia of Dallas-based Brown Fox
Kizzia  Johnson PLLC. He also posted a link to a letter Kizzia
sent to the producers on his behalf, denying the allegations in
the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The producers asked the court to order Carbone to stop
soliciting non-public information about the show in advance of
its broadcast and quit offering participants and employees money
for the secret information. Additionally, they seek money
damages, and awards of attorney fees and litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NZK Productions and Horizon Alternative Television are
represented by Tina Wong and Linda M. Burrow of Caldwell, Leslie
 Proctor PC of Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is NZK Products Inc., v. Stephen Carbone, 2:11-
cv-10118-GHK-E, U.S. District Court, Central District of
California (Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) failed to win
a court order blocking Apple Inc. (AAPL) from selling its newest
smartphone, the iPhone 4S, in France. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Paris court rejected Samsung&#8217;s request for an emergency
order against Apple while it considers the South Korean
company&#8217;s patent-infringement claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung, the biggest maker of smartphones, sought to block
sales of the new handset in France, Italy and the U.K. days
after it was unveiled in October, arguing that Apple violated
its wireless-communications patents. Suwon, South Korea-based
Samsung sued in Paris in July over earlier versions of the
iPhone and Apple&#8217;s iPad tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The disproportionate character of the ban sought by
Samsung against Apple is clear,&#8221; Judge Marie-Christine
Courboulay said in yesterday&#8217;s decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Paris court ruled Samsung must pay Apple 100,000 euros
($134,100) for legal fees while denying Apple&#8217;s request for
damages. Samsung&#8217;s claim wasn&#8217;t &#8220;abusive&#8221; and the company&#8217;s
infringement claims can move forward as a regular lawsuit,
Courboulay said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florence Catel, a Samsung spokeswoman in Paris, declined to
comment on the decision. Calls to Apple&#8217;s office in London for
comment weren&#8217;t immediately returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung has been locked in a global legal battle with Apple
since the Cupertino, California-based company claimed in an
April suit that Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy devices copied the iPad and
iPhone. Samsung was the world&#8217;s biggest maker of smartphones in
the last quarter, while Apple dominates the tablet market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies have filed at least 30 lawsuits in 10
countries, and European Union regulators have started an
antitrust probe of the companies&#8217; use of smartphone patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Milan court will hold a hearing Dec. 16 concerning
Samsung&#8217;s Italian suit. In a Dec. 3 decision, a federal court in
San Jose, California, rejected Apple&#8217;s request to block
Samsung&#8217;s 4G smartphone and its Galaxy 10.1 tablet computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva&#8217;s Cephalon Wins Appeal Against Watson Over Fentora Copy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA)&#8217;s Cephalon unit won an
appeals court decision that prevents Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc.
from selling a generic copy of the painkiller Fentora until
2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in
Washington yesterday upheld the validity of a Cephalon patent on
Fentora and backed a lower-court ruling that Watson infringed
the patent. The appeals court posted a notice of the decision on
its website without a formal opinion explaining its findings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fentora is approved to relieve sudden episodes of cancer
pain in adults already taking opioids, or morphine-like drugs.
Cephalon has said its patent 6,264,981 that was upheld expires
in 2019 and is for a process of making the tablet dissolve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug generated $81 million in U.S. sales in the first
half, Cephalon said in August. Petach Tikva, Israel-based Teva
bought Cephalon in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Cephalon Inc. v. Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI),
09cv724, U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware
(Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DC Comics Loses Bid to Block Superloans Logo in New Zealand &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DC Comics lost its bid to ban the logo of a New Zealand
finance company for infringing its Superman trademarks, New
Zealand&#8217;s Dominion Post reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand&#8217;s intellectual property office said there was a
clear difference between Superman and Buck, the flying superhero
used by Wellington-based Superloans, according to the Dominion
Post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The office said Buck has a shield on his chest bearing a
dollar sign, and his holding money in his hand deviated from
Superman&#8217;s altruistic orientation, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DC Comics was ordered to pay Superloans&#8217; litigation costs,
according to the Dominion Post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hermes Infringement Complaint Leads to Indictment in Taiwan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hermes International (RMS)&#8217;s trademarks associated with is Birkin
handbag were found to have been infringed by the maker of the
canvas &#8220;Banane Taipei&#8221; bags, according to the Taipei Times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logos of the French luxury-goods company were copied and
placed on the Taiwan bags, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a complaint from Paris-based Hermes, Taipei&#8217;s
Intellectual Property Office rejected an application to register
the Banane Taipei logo and the products&#8217; two creators were
indicted for criminal trademark infringement, the Times said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banane Taipei bags became popular in Taiwan after actress
Barbie Hsu gave them away as gifts to guests at her wedding in
May, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Sanuki Udon&#8217; Noodle Trademarks Canceled by China&#8217;s IP Office &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s Intellectual Property Office canceled a trademark
for noodle products after a Japanese company complained, the
China Post reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Namchow Group lost the registration for &#8220;Sanuki Udon,&#8221;
which Japan&#8217;s Kabashima Co. had argued was a place name and
public property not entitled to trademark protection, according
to China Post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanuki udon noodles are a product of Japan&#8217;s Kagawa
Prefecture, and because of the ruling, the name can be used by
any maker of udon-type noodles from flour from the Sanuku region
of Kagawa, according to China Post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Namchow officials told the China Post they are discussing
whether to appeal the Intellectual Property Office&#8217;s ruling to
China&#8217;s Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti-Piracy Role Added to U.S. Trade Agency in Draft Bill &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. lawmakers unveiled draft legislation that would give
the International Trade Commission the lead role in fighting
foreign websites trafficking in illegal content and counterfeit
goods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The draft bill, released yesterday by Senator Ron Wyden, an
Oregon Democrat, and Representative Darrell Issa, a California
Republican, is meant as an alternative to Hollywood-backed anti-
piracy legislation under consideration by the House and Senate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those measures pit the movie and music industries, which
want a stronger crackdown on online piracy, against Google Inc. (GOOG),
Facebook Inc. and other Web companies that say the bills may
ensnare legitimate websites and threaten the growth of the U.S.
technology industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The draft bill released by Wyden and Issa, called the
Online Protection and Enforcement of Digital Trade Act, lets
U.S. intellectual-property owners petition the trade agency to
investigate foreign websites linked to piracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the bill, the commission may issue cease-and-desist
orders against foreign websites that &#8220;primarily&#8221; and
&#8220;willfully&#8221; engage in copyright infringement. Those orders
could be used to force U.S.-based payment and advertising
companies to stop providing services to such sites, according to
the draft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wyden-Issa proposal contrasts with Hollywood-backed
anti-piracy bills that were introduced this year and have
multiple co-sponsors from both parties. Those measures would let
the U.S. Justice Department seek court orders forcing Internet-
service providers, search engines, payment services and
advertising networks to block or cease business with foreign
websites linked to piracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hollywood-backed measure in the House, the Stop Online
Piracy Act, also would give intellectual-property owners,
through private action and in court, the ability to push U.S.
payment processors and online-advertising services to stop doing
business with foreign websites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representative Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican and chairman
of the House Judiciary Committee, has said he plans to hold a
committee vote before year-end on the Stop Online Piracy Act,
which he introduced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, Facebook and other Web companies said in a Nov. 15
letter that the House and Senate measures would create &#8220;new
uncertain liabilities&#8221; for Internet companies and asked
lawmakers to seek &#8220;more targeted ways&#8221; to combat &#8220;rogue&#8221;
websites in other countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NetCoalition, a technology-industry group representing
Google, Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) and EBay Inc., supports having the ITC
handle copyright and trademark-infringement cases against
foreign websites, Markham Erickson, the group&#8217;s executive
director, said in an interview this week. The Washington-based
group&#8217;s members include Bloomberg LP, the parent company of
Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studio executives have expressed concern the trade
commission isn&#8217;t equipped to take on enforcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alternative bill from Wyden and Issa is still in draft
form and may be introduced as legislation within a week,
Jennifer Hoelzer, a spokeswoman for Wyden, said in an interview.
The draft bill has been posted on a website to solicit comments
and feedback. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency has the power to block imports of products found
to infringe intellectual-property rights. It&#8217;s at the center of
patent battles over smartphone technology and is investigating
allegations of unfair trade practices by China in the solar-
panel industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola&#8217;s Secret Formula Finds New Home in Downtown Atlanta &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world&#8217;s largest maker of soft drinks,
moved its closely guarded formula from a bank vault to a tourist
attraction in downtown Atlanta, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recipe went from one of SunTrust Inc. (STI)&#8217;s banks to the
newly built &#8220;Vault of the Secret Formula&#8221; at the World of
Coca-Cola exhibit, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 125-year-old formula belonging to Atlanta-based Coca-
Cola had been housed at SunTrust since 1925, the newspaper
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the new vault will be visible to the public, its
size, security details and cost will be as closely guarded a
secret as the formula itself, the Journal-Constitution said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Bachelor&#8217; Producers Sue &#8216;Reality Steve&#8217; Over Program Spoilers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The producers of &#8220;The Bachelor&#8221; reality television
program sued the Texas-based operator of a &#8220;spoiler&#8221; website
for trying to disclose secrets about the program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Spoilers&#8221; are information that reveal a plot or
program&#8217;s outcome in advance of its conclusion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the complaint filed Dec. 6 in federal court in Los
Angeles, Burbank, California-based NZK Productions Inc. and
Horizon Alternative Television Inc. accused Stephen Carbone of
revealing &#8220;non-public information regarding events that
transpired on the Bachelor series episodes prior to their
broadcast.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Bachelor&#8221; and its spin-off &#8220;Bachelorette,&#8221; which
are broadcast on Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s ABC network, feature either a
male or female principal character who, over the course of the
series, selects a potential marriage partner from among 25
contestants selected by the producers. The identity of the
chosen person -- who is given the &#8220;final rose&#8221; -- isn&#8217;t
revealed until the final show of the series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint, Carbone has contacted
participants, casts and crew members of &#8220;The Bachelor&#8221; and
induced them to breach their confidentiality agreements. He then
allegedly posted the information on the RealitySteve.com
website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The producers claim Carbone offered at least one
participant $2,500 to reveal information about the show.
Although Carbone was sent a cease-and-desist letter in August,
and a second in November, he has continued to solicit
confidential information from participants in the program,
according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbone posted a notice on his website referring all
inquiries to his counsel, Brad Kizzia of Dallas-based Brown Fox
Kizzia  Johnson PLLC. He also posted a link to a letter Kizzia
sent to the producers on his behalf, denying the allegations in
the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The producers asked the court to order Carbone to stop
soliciting non-public information about the show in advance of
its broadcast and quit offering participants and employees money
for the secret information. Additionally, they seek money
damages, and awards of attorney fees and litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NZK Productions and Horizon Alternative Television are
represented by Tina Wong and Linda M. Burrow of Caldwell, Leslie
 Proctor PC of Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is NZK Products Inc., v. Stephen Carbone, 2:11-
cv-10118-GHK-E, U.S. District Court, Central District of
California (Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TengizChevroil LLP, the Kazakh oil
venture led by Chevron Corp. (CVX), said production &#8220;safely returned
to normal rates&#8221; yesterday evening after a fire at one of its
processing plants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The liquefied petroleum gas treatment unit has been
isolated after the blaze, the Atyrau-based venture said today in
an e-mailed statement. The Complex Technology Line 1 at the
Tengiz oilfield is running without the unit, the venture said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Teams are concentrating on repairing the unit and the
investigative group has begun work to determine the cause of the
incident,&#8221; the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TengizChevroil said yesterday the fire at the processing
plant will have a &#8220;minimal&#8221; effect on total production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, holds 50 percent
of TengizChevroil. Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) has 25 percent,
Kazakhstan&#8217;s state-owned KazMunaiGaz National Co. owns 20
percent and Lukarco, owned by Russia&#8217;s OAO Lukoil, 5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s blood-cancer drug
Mylotarg, pulled from the market last year after it was linked
to deaths, helped a different group of patients, a study found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients newly diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia who
received Mylotarg with chemotherapy lived for 25 months after
treatment, compared with 15 months for those given chemotherapy
alone, according to the study released today at the American
Society of Hematology meeting in San Diego. Mylotarg had
previously been used in patients ages 60 and older only after
their cancer had returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, will talk with U.S.
regulators about whether the medicine may return to the market,
said Mace Rothenberg, senior vice president of clinical
development and medical affairs for the New York-based company&#8217;s
oncology unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are working closely with investigators to better
understand the findings from this study,&#8221; Rothenberg said in a
telephone interview. The next step would be &#8220;taking these data
forward as a potential new submission, working with regulators,
if we choose to go that path,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study results may presage new life for what was an $83
million product in 2009, according to Evaluate Pharma. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer pulled the drug in June 2010 after 10 years on the
market. The Food and Drug Administration requested the company
stop selling the therapy after a clinical trial showed it didn&#8217;t
help patients and was tied to deaths from liver complications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expedited Review &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mylotarg was approved in 2000 under an expedited review
process, which requires companies to conduct follow-up studies.
One such trial that began in 2004 was stopped early after
patients died and others didn&#8217;t appear to benefit. Pfizer
obtained Mylotarg in 2009 when it bought Wyeth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug originally was approved for patients 60 and older
who had a relapse of acute myeloid leukemia, a blood cancer that
begins growing in the bone marrow. The disease will be diagnosed
in 13,000 people in the U.S. this year and has a five-year
survival rate of 23 percent, according to the National
Institutes of Health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mylotarg was the first therapy approved to treat patients
whose cancer had returned and was the first drug to be withdrawn
after winning approval under the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration&#8217;s accelerated review program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study released today involved 280 patients ages 50 to
70 who were first diagnosed with the disease. The group was
treated with chemotherapy and some patients also received
Mylotarg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treatment Dosage &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizers&#8217;s drug was given to patients over a week, in 3
milligram increments, said Sylvie Castaigne, the principal
investigator. &#8220;We used a small dose, and repeated the dose a
short intervals,&#8221; said Castaigne, a professor in the department
of hematology at H&#244;pital de Versailles in Versailles, France. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next &#8220;will be to test the drug in younger patients,
because we know that younger patients respond better than older
patients to chemotherapy,&#8221; Castaigne said in a telephone
interview from San Francisco. Researchers also examine whether
they can get similar results with a lower dose. &#8220;We are right
at the limit of toxicity now,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug must be resubmitted to the FDA with the new data
before it could return to the U.S. market, Rothenberg said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our knowledge is always moving forward, and sometimes we
may not always have the best insights of how best to use the
drug when it first arrives,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In this case, it was
right on that margin, and it fell back. Now it&#8217;s just a question
of finding that right dose in the right patients, and clearly
demonstrating a benefit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MF Global Holdings Ltd.&#8217;s
$25.3 million in cash held at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is presumed
to be its own, the bankrupt company&#8217;s Chapter 11 trustee said in
response to customer objections to its bid to use the money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global Holdings should be allowed to use the cash
collateral of JPMorgan, trustee Louis J. Freeh said in papers
filed today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. Customers of
the company&#8217;s failed brokerage, MF Global Inc., had asserted
that the money may have been part of the $1.2 billion believed
to be missing from their segregated accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The customers have failed to provide this court with any
actual evidence in support of their position,&#8221; Freeh said in
court papers. MF Global Holdings owns the New York-based bank
account with JPMorgan, and under New York law, it is presumed
that funds deposited in an account belong to the account holder,
the trustee said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global Holdings, once run by former New Jersey Governor
and ex-Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) co-chairman Jon Corzine, filed
the eighth-largest U.S. bankruptcy after a wrong-way $6.3
billion trade on its own behalf on bonds of some of Europe&#8217;s
most indebted nations. About $1.2 billion may be missing from
segregated customer accounts, according to James Giddens, the
trustee liquidating the MF Global brokerage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cash Talks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has been in talks with JPMorgan, its largest
lender, on the use of cash collateral to pay the costs of its
bankruptcy, a lawyer for Freeh said last week. U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Martin Glenn said Dec. 9 that he would reconsider the use
of cash at a hearing Dec. 14 after customers objected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, agent to a $1.2 billion loan, agreed at the
outset of MF Global Holdings&#8217; bankruptcy to let it use $26
million, subject to an agreement that gives the bank a lien on
all of the company&#8217;s assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate court filing today, attorneys for Giddens
said that the trustee&#8217;s law firm had ended its one
&#8220;insignificant&#8221; active representation of JPMorgan and prior
work for the bank in the bankruptcy case of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. was unrelated to the debtor and wouldn&#8217;t
constitute &#8220;representations of interests adverse to the
estate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is a current client and auditor
of Giddens&#8217;s law firm, and the relationships are such that the
firm &#8220;will not be adverse to&#8221; the accounting company, the
attorneys said. Two of the ten secured credit facility lenders
are or may become current clients of Giddens&#8217;s firm, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$300 Million Loan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn&#8217;t yet known whether JPMorgan or
PricewaterhouseCoopers are creditors of MF Global Inc.,
Giddens&#8217;s lawyers said. It&#8217;s believed that lenders under a
$300 million loan to MF Global&#8217;s parent, for which JPMorgan was
agent, were fully secured, the lawyers said. Giddens&#8217;s firm can
sue JPMorgan if a potential dispute arises; any legal action
against PricewaterhouseCoopers would be handled by a &#8220;conflicts
counsel,&#8221; they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Giddens are seeking a determination by a judge

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the largest
software maker, replaced Andy Lees as head of its Windows Phone
Division after losing share to Google Inc. (GOOG) in the market for
mobile operating systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terry Myerson, a vice president, will take charge of the
division, while Lees takes on a new role, reporting to Chief
Executive Officer Steve Ballmer, Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft said in an e-mail posted to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s share of the market for mobile-phone operating
systems dropped to 1.5 percent in the third quarter from 2.7
percent a year earlier, according to Gartner Inc. Share for
Google&#8217;s Android more than doubled to 53 percent from 25 percent
in the same period. Ballmer, in the blog posting, thanked Lees
&#8220;for his contributions to the phone team.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myerson will be in charge of operations including Windows
Phone development and marketing, Ballmer said. Lees, who will
retain his title of president, will work with Ballmer on Windows
Phone and the coming Windows 8 software designed for tablets,
the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re trying to deliver this whole seamless experience
across devices and they&#8217;re probably better off having one person
trying to oversee that,&#8221; said Sid Parakh, an analyst at McAdams
Wright Ragen in Seattle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Share Losses to Google &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is aiming to regain share lost to Android and
Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPhone with updated software and a partnership with
handset maker Nokia Oyj. (NOK1V) Apple had 15 percent of the mobile-
software market last quarter, while Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) had
11 percent share, according to Gartner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ballmer&#8217;s deputies are also working on Windows 8 to run
tablet machines capable of rivaling Apple&#8217;s iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myerson, who joined Microsoft in 1997, had previously
overseen Windows Phone engineering. He was shifted to that role
from Microsoft&#8217;s Exchange e-mail product as the company decided
to scrap previous work on Windows Mobile and redo phone software
to better appeal to consumers in the wake of the iPhone&#8217;s
success. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomas Lee, chief U.S. equity
strategist at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), estimated the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 Index will rally to 1,430 next year and recommended
financial stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee&#8217;s forecast is 14 percent higher than the closing level
on Dec. 9 of 1,255.19. He estimated combined profit by companies (SPX)
in the benchmark equity gauge will be $105 a share in 2012 and
$110 in 2013. Based on his projection for earnings in 2013, the
SP 500 will trade at a price-earnings multiple of 13 times,
according to a note dated Dec. 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The consensus view is that visibility remains murky and
with significant tail risks&#8221; such as Europe&#8217;s debt crisis and
fiscal tightening in China, Lee said. &#8220;2012 may look a bit like
2009,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Emergence from a financial crisis and the
potential for acceleration of the business cycle driven by
Europe exiting a recession and China easing&#8221; may boost cyclical
stocks. Financials, which may be helped by Republican gains in
the U.S. election, are his &#8220;top pick,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financials have plunged 21 percent in 2011, the most of the
10 groups in the SP 500 (SPXL1), as investors fled banks and insurers
on concern Europe&#8217;s debt crisis will spread. Material and
industrial shares had the next biggest declines, falling 13
percent and 5 percent, respectively. In 2009, from the SP 500&#8217;s
bottom on March 9, 2009, through the end of the year, financials
surged 131 percent, while consumer discretionary, industrials
and materials jumped at least 83 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee&#8217;s SP 500 estimate is the second-highest of 11
strategists surveyed by Bloomberg, who on average forecast the
measure will climb to 1,350 next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 fell 1.5 percent to 1,236.47 at 4 p.m. New York
time. The measure has lost 1.7 percent in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, authorized a new share buyback program for as much as
$10 billion as Lipitor lost about 15 percent of its market in
the first week the cholesterol pill faced generic competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quarterly dividend was increased to 22 cents a share
from 20 cents, according to a statement today. The stock
repurchase plan is in addition to Pfizer&#8217;s existing program, the
New York-based company said. Chief Executive Officer Ian Read,
58, also was named board chairman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer lost U.S. patent protection on its biggest seller,
the Lipitor cholesterol pill, at the end of last month. Generic
versions of the drug accounted for about 15 percent of the
Lipitor market in the week ended December 2, the first week
copies were available, according to a report today from Chris Schott, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buyback &#8220;is on first thought higher than what most
people were anticipating,&#8221; said Damien Conover, an analyst at
Morningstar Inc. (MORN) in Chicago, in a telephone interview. &#8220;It will
be viewed as a positive by the investment community.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has been working to minimize losses from Lipitor by
making deals with insurers to block the use of generic versions
in exchange for lowering the price of branded Lipitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a very complicated generic launch, the way Pfizer
is going after retaining share, this is rather unprecedented,&#8221;
said Conover. &#8220;It is probably a little too early to tell&#8221; how
well the company will do in holding off generics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Repurchase Plan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under its existing program, Pfizer had repurchased $6.5
billion of shares as of November 1, and it anticipates
repurchasing between $7 billion and $9 billion this year, said
Joan Campion, a spokeswoman for Pfizer, in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the new repurchase program Pfizer plans to buy about
$5 billion of its stock in 2012 with the rest of the $10 billion
amount available in 2013 and beyond, the company said in its
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The dividend increase and new share repurchase program
are a testament to our continued commitment to enhancing
shareholder value and to our continued confidence in the
business,&#8221; Read said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read took over the board chairman position from George Lorch, who will become an independent director, the company said
in a separate statement. Read became CEO after Jeffrey Kindler
resigned as chief executive officer and chairman in December
2010. Lorch was named to the board post a few days later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares declined less than 1 percent to $20.39 at
4:00 p.m. New York time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave Checketts, former Madison
Square Garden (MSG) president and St. Louis Blues owner, is in talks
to become chief executive officer of Legends Hospitality 
Management LLC, the concessions, merchandising and 
management-services company owned by the New York Yankees, 
Dallas Cowboys and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), according to a 
person with direct knowledge of the talks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person was granted anonymity because the agreement
isn&#8217;t complete. Checketts declined to comment. Todd Fleming, a
spokesman for Legends, didn&#8217;t return a message left at his
office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group led by Checketts will take about a 16 percent stake
in the company, which was created in 2008, the person said. 
The Yankees, Major League Baseball&#8217;s most valuable team, and the 
Cowboys, the National Football League&#8217;s most valuable club according 
to Forbes annual rankings, each own 34 percent of Legends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 56-year-old Checketts, who is selling the National
Hockey League&#8217;s Blues, will acquire the Legends stake held by
CIC Partners, whose founding partner, Michael Rawlings, was
elected mayor of Dallas in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legends last month acquired Conventions, Sports and Leisure
International, which specializes in financial analysis for
organizations planning to build or renovate sports facilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales and marketing clients for Newark, New Jersey-based
Legends include football&#8217;s San Francisco 49ers and Tampa Bay
Buccaneers; basketball&#8217;s Charlotte Bobcats, Indiana Pacers,
Oklahoma City Thunder and Phoenix Suns; baseball&#8217;s San Diego
Padres; and college football&#8217;s Rose Bowl, according to the
company&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legends supplies concessions to Yankee Stadium and Cowboys
Stadium. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yankees Success &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Yankees are the most successful team in Major League
Baseball history, having won 27 World Series. The Cowboys earned
the nickname &#8220;America&#8217;s Team&#8221; while winning five Super Bowls
with Hall of Fame players such as Roger Staubach, Tony Dorsett
and Troy Aikman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checketts ran MSG, putting him in charge of the New York
Knicks and Rangers, from 1994 to 2001. During his tenure,
hockey&#8217;s Rangers won the Stanley Cup, ending a 54-year drought.
The Knicks reached the NBA Finals in 1994 and 1999, losing both
times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also was in charge when the Knicks traded Hall of Fame
center Patrick Ewing to the Seattle SuperSonics in 2000,
ushering in a decade in which New York compiled a .399 winning
percentage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checketts resigned in a power struggle with James Dolan,
chief executive officer of Cablevision, which owned the teams at
the time. Cablevision said in 2009 that it was spinning off it
its MSG assets, including the sports teams and Radio City Music
Hall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Knicks had a 433-game regular-season sellout streak
from 1993-2002. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Daniel Kruger and Liz Capo McCormick" date="Dec 12, 2011  1:31 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-12-12/u-s-growth-decoupling-from-treasuries-means-record-low-yields-to-jpmorgan.html"><headline>U.S. Growth Decoupling From Treasuries Means Record Low Yields to JPMorgan</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The strengthening U.S. economy is
proving no deterrent to the biggest rally in Treasuries since
2008, and America&#8217;s largest bank says it may get even better for
bond investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. government debt has returned 8.9 percent this year,
including reinvested interest, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
indexes show. That compares with the 1.8 percent gain in the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 index of stocks when dividends are
included. The rally in Treasuries accelerated since October even
as reports showed improvements in everything from consumer
confidence to jobless claims to manufacturing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While government debt usually suffers as a strengthening
economy spurs inflation and encourages investors to take bigger
risks with their money, this recovery has been different because
Europe&#8217;s sovereign debt crisis has elevated the stress in the
global financial system, bolstering demand for the safest
assets. Strategists at JPMorgan Chase  Co. say 10-year Treasury
yields, which ended last week at 2.06 percent, may fall toward
the record low of 1.67 percent by the end of March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As the concern around the euro zone continues to worsen,
the money is flowing into the U.S.,&#8221; Terry Belton, the global
head of fixed-income strategy at New York-based JPMorgan, the
biggest bank by assets, said in a Dec. 7 telephone interview.
&#8220;Even though U.S. Treasuries are rich, at least you know what
you have when you buy them, as they are dollar denominated.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dollar Appreciation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar has appreciated 8.5 percent since its low this
year on Aug. 1, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Indexes, which measure the currency&#8217;s performance against the
euro, yen and seven of its other major developed market peers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cumulative outflows from the euro last week were twice the
average in the same period last year, according to Bank of New
York Mellon Corp., the world&#8217;s largest custodial bank, with more
than $26 trillion in assets under administration. The firm
doesn&#8217;t provide specific figures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Europe is the tail wagging the dog,&#8221; Dominic Konstam,
head of interest-rate strategy at Deutsche Bank AG in New York,
one of the 21 primary dealers of U.S. government securities that
trade with the Federal Reserve, said in a Dec. 7 telephone
interview. The European crisis has led traders to price in more
risk to measures of health in the financial system which
&#8220;haven&#8217;t gone away&#8221; even with efforts of policy makers, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Falling Yields &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on 10-year notes rose three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, last week to 2.06 percent, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The benchmark 2 percent security
due November 2021 rose 14/32, or $4.38 per $1,000 face amount,
to 99 29/32. The yield was 4 basis points lower at 2.02 percent
as of 1:29 p.m. New York time today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields have fallen from 2.42 percent in October and are
below the average of 6.83 percent since 1980 as Europe&#8217;s debt
crisis, which led to the bailouts of Greece, Ireland and
Portugal, threaten to engulf Italy and Spain. Yields on 10-year
bonds of Italy, which has more than $2 trillion of debt, ended
last week at 6.36 percent, up from the low this year of 4.52
percent in February and above the average of 4.46 percent since
2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Central Bank cut its main interest rate twice
since early November, to 1 percent from 1.5 percent, and the
region&#8217;s leaders unveiled a plan last week for a closer fiscal
union to save their single currency. They agreed to add 200
billion euros ($267 billion) to their rescue fund and to tighten
rules to curb future debt. They accelerated the start of a 500
billion-euro rescue fund to next year and reduced demands that
bondholders share in losses from rescues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swap-Yield Correlation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with the moves, two-year interest-rate swap spreads, a
measure of stress in the financial system, ended last week
little changed at about 42 basis points. That&#8217;s more than 50
percent greater than its average this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 120-day correlation between changes in the spread and
the 10-year yield reached negative 0.5 this quarter, the highest
since Greece sought a bailout in August 2010. Correlations of
one mean assets move in lock stop, and negative one signal they
move in the opposite direction. As recently as the first
quarter, when Treasuries lost 0.14 percent, the correlation was
zero. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the environment that we&#8217;re in, which is fear of
Europe, those fears are overwhelming any movement in the
economy,&#8221; Thomas Roth, a senior trader in New York at
Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA Inc., said in a Dec. 8 telephone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth in the euro area economy will probably slow to 0.5
percent next year from 1.6 percent in 2011, while the U.S.
likely will accelerate to 2.19 percent from 1.8 percent,
according to Bloomberg surveys of economists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed Steps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a July 29 Commerce Department report showed the
economy expanded at a 0.4 percent pace from January to March and
at a 1.3 percent rate in the following three months, slower than
previously reported, the Fed took steps to spur growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Policy makers led by Chairman Ben S. Bernanke pledged on
Aug. 9 that the central bank would hold its target rate for
overnight loans between banks at about zero for at least the
next two years and said Sept. 21 they would extend maturities of
the Fed&#8217;s Treasury holdings by purchasing $400 billion of long-
term debt and selling an equal amount of shorter-term
securities. That was after buying $2.3 trillion of government
and mortgage securities from November 2008 through June 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manufacturers are now more optimistic about sales, spending
and hiring for next year than service companies, a sign
factories will remain at the forefront of the expansion,
according to the Institute for Supply Management. Purchasing
managers anticipate sales will grow 5.5 percent next year and
capital investment will increase 1.9 percent, the semiannual
forecast from the Tempe, Arizona-based group showed on Dec. 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yield Forecasts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labor Department figures on Dec. 8 showed weekly jobless
claims fell to the lowest level since February. A day later, the
Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of
consumer sentiment rose to 67.7 for December, a six-month high,
from 64.1 at the end of November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strategists forecasting falling yields are in the minority.
The median estimates of 64 economists surveyed by Bloomberg is
for 10-year rates to rise to 2.19 percent next quarter, 2.35
percent by the end of June, 2.5 percent in the third quarter and
2.6 percent a year from now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if those estimates prove accurate, yields would still
hold below their average of 3.19 percent in 2010, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. That would help the administration of U.S.
President Barack Obama finance a $1.3 trillion budget deficit.
Interest expense on U.S. debt totaled 2.7 percent of gross
domestic product in fiscal 2011 ended Sept. 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Breaking Point?&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economy is &#8220;not strong enough to generate a big move
up in yields given the fear that&#8217;s out there,&#8221; said Roth at
Mitsubishi UFJ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macroeconomic Advisers LLC cut its estimate on Dec. 2 for
U.S. growth in the first half of 2012 to 1.9 percent, from 2.2
percent a month earlier, citing the negative &#8220;spillover&#8221;
effects of the euro zone crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have a financial and banking crisis in the euro
zone,&#8221; Lawrence Meyer, a senior managing director in Washington
at Macroeconomic Advisers and a former Fed governor, said in a
telephone interview on Dec. 6. &#8220;The questions now are &#8216;Will it
get worse?&#8217; &#8216;How much worse?&#8217; and &#8216;Will it get to a breaking
point?&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dollar Demand &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European bank demand for dollars remains about the highest
since October 2008 even after central banks reduced the cost of
emergency funds by half a percentage point on Nov. 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three-month cross-currency basis swap, the rate banks
pay to convert euro payments into dollars, was 122 basis points
to 126 basis points below the euro interbank offered rate in
London. That&#8217;s the most expensive since Dec. 5. The cost rose on
Dec. 9 on concern the measures won&#8217;t stem the region&#8217;s debt
crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The longer that Europe muddles, the more people will fear
you&#8217;ll have some sort of disorderly breakdown,&#8221; Thomas Girard,
a bond fund manager in a group with $115 billion in assets at
New York Life Investment Management in New York, said in a Dec.
7 telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risks range from bank failures to a country leaving the
euro currency, he said. &#8220;All of those things have the effect of
putting downward pressure on Treasury yields.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s money-
management unit agreed to buy the mutual-fund management
business of Dividend Growth Advisors LLC to increase its income-
oriented offerings. Terms were not disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acquired business includes the Rising Dividend Growth
Fund, which had $153 million in assets of Oct. 31, New York-
based Goldman Sachs Asset Management said today in a statement.
Dividend Growth Advisors is a closely held money-management
company based in South Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management, which has $821 billion in
assets, said the purchase will broaden its mutual-fund offerings
to include strategies that provide investors with an income
stream through the payment of dividends. The fund, which will
now be called the Goldman Sachs Rising Dividend Growth Fund,
invests in companies that have paid dividends that increase by
at least 10 percent a year for a minimum of 10 consecutive
years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund&#8217;s reorganization must be approved by its
shareholders, with a vote expected in the first quarter of 2012,
according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rising Dividend fund has advanced at an average annual
rate of 4.6 percent over the past five years, beating 98 percent
of similarly-managed funds, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. This year, the fund has increased 2.5 percent, better
than 72 percent of peers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian political risk sparked by
ballot-rigging allegations in parliamentary elections may remain
&#8220;repellent&#8221; for stocks for months to come, even after
nationwide protests ended peacefully, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Large-scale political protests have taken their toll on
the market, with Russia massively underperforming global
emerging market peers in the past week,&#8221; said Alex Kantarovich,
a strategist at JPMorgan in Moscow, in an e-mailed note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Dmitry Medvedev said yesterday he ordered an
investigation into allegations of electoral fraud in the Dec. 4
elections to parliament, which was won by the dominant United
Russia party that he and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin promoted.
About 25,000 people gathered in near-freezing weather in central
Moscow the day before to protest the results of elections, with
tens of thousands more doing the same in St. Petersburg and
other major cities, according to police. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Micex Index rallied today, rising 1.5 percent, the most
this month, to 1,416.49 at 12:49 p.m., after nationwide protests
Dec. 10 concluded peacefully. That measure tumbled 7.3 percent
last week, the most in almost three months, as earlier protests
led to the detention of hundreds of activists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protests will probably continue sporadically into the 
first quarter of 2012, yet fail to broaden, JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most likely scenario is that Putin&#8217;s plan to return to
the Kremlin in the March vote for president will go according to
plan and stocks will &#8220;experience a drag until then,&#8221;
Kantarovich said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Machin, who ran Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s investment banking business in Asia for six years,
is leaving after two decades with the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machin, 45, is stepping down from his position as vice-
chairman for the Asia-Pacific region excluding Japan, according
to an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg News. Edward Naylor, a
spokesman for the firm in Hong Kong, confirmed the contents of
the document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs partner since 2002, Machin is considering
taking a position with an investment business, two people with
knowledge of the matter said, asking not to be identified as no
final decision has been made. He will move to Hong Kong from
Beijing in January, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machin is the most senior manager at Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
investment bank in Asia to depart since Ravi Sinha, co-head of
the division for the region, stepped down in April 2010. Yusuf Alireza, the New York-based firm&#8217;s co-president of operations
for the Asia-Pacific region outside Japan, left last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machin, who trained as a doctor at Oxford University before
joining Goldman Sachs, moved to Beijing from Hong Kong in 2009
to oversee the expansion of the advisory business in China,
which was the world&#8217;s biggest generator of initial public
offering fees last year according to researcher Freeman  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top MA Adviser &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is the second-largest arranger of stock and
convertible bond sales overseas by Chinese companies this year
behind Morgan Stanley and is third in advising on mergers, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The firm ranks 29th in the league
table for domestic equity and convertible bond offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time since 2004, Goldman Sachs this year
captured the top spot among arrangers of equity and equity-
linked offerings in the Asia-Pacific region outside Japan,
according to Bloomberg data. The firm also ranks first in
mergers advisory in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machin, who became regional co-head of investment banking
in 2005, stepped down from that position in February. In that
role he had worked with William Wicker, Richard Ong and Sinha,
all former co-heads of investment banking in Asia who left the
firm as partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Ryan, who was previously co-head of investment
banking for Asia together with Machin, became sole president of
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s operations in the region when Alireza left. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;California-blend gasoline in San
Francisco strengthened to the highest level against futures in
more than three weeks after Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) reported a
breakdown at the Torrance refinery in Southern California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in San Francisco rose
4.25 cents to a premium of 4.5 cents versus gasoline futures on
the New York Mercantile Exchange at 4:21 p.m. New York time,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The spread was at the
highest level since Nov. 18. Prompt-delivery of the fuel in San
Francisco jumped 10.43 cents to $2.6704 a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 150,000-barrel-a-day Torrance refinery, south of Los
Angeles, had a breakdown that may result in unplanned flaring
for the rest of the day, Irving, Texas-based Exxon said in a
filing with the South Coast Air Quality Management District. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barbara Burgett, an Exxon spokeswoman at the refinery, said
in a telephone interview that she was looking into the incident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbob in Los Angeles rose 2.75 cents to a premium of 8.5
cents a gallon against futures, also its highest level since
Nov. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend diesel, known as CARB diesel, in Los
Angeles climbed 0.87 cent to a discount of 2.13 cents to heating
oil futures traded on the Nymex. The same fuel in San Francisco
slipped 0.25 cent to a discount of 2.25 cents to futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in Portland, Oregon, fell
3.5 cents to a discount of 2 cents to futures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The liquidator of the MF Global Inc.
brokerage said that &#8220;certain&#8221; actions of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM),
a lender to the broker-dealer&#8217;s parent, &#8220;are likely to be the
subject of investigation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trustee, James Giddens, said he would &#8220;act with the
respect to&#8221; those actions to recover money for brokerage
customers if necessary. If the bank received so-called
preferential payments before the brokerage went into
liquidation, or other payments, he would deal &#8220;appropriately&#8221;
with the transfers or other issues, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;HHR may threaten or bring an action against JPM in the
context of a potential dispute between&#8221; the bank and the
brokerage, he said in a court filing yesterday. Giddens&#8217;s law
firm is Hughes Hubbard  Reed LLP, or HHR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, was agent for a $1.2
billion loan to the broker-dealer&#8217;s parent, and also for a $300
million loan to the brokerage, according to the filing. Giddens
made the statement about suing the bank after a judge asked him
if he was disinterested enough to litigate in light of past work
for JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broker-dealer paid JPMorgan and the other secured
lenders back for the $300 million loan, Giddens said. He didn&#8217;t
know yet if the bank was still a creditor of the brokerage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a Client &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan isn&#8217;t a &#8220;current client&#8221; of the law firm,
Giddens told the Manhattan federal judge. Giddens&#8217;s firm ended
&#8220;minor&#8221; patent and other work for JPMorgan and collected less
than $2,000 in fees from the bank in 2011 and less than $35,000
in 2009 and 2010, Giddens said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brokerage&#8217;s parent, MF Global Holdings Ltd., is in a
separate court proceeding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to
comment on Gidden&#8217;s statement about lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three transfers of collateral made and pending will give
commodity customers about $4 billion of their assets, according
to court filings. Giddens is due to testify on his progress in
Washington today before the Senate Agriculture Committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parent company&#8217;s Oct. 31 bankruptcy filing, the eighth-
largest in U.S. history, listed assets of $41 billion. Jon Corzine, the former co-chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., quit as MF Global&#8217;s CEO on Nov. 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brokerage case is Securities Investor Protection Corp.
v. MF Global Inc., 11-02790, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). The parent&#8217;s bankruptcy case
is MF Global Holdings Ltd., 11-bk-15059, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Novell Inc. (NOVL) and Microsoft Corp. made
closing arguments today in Novell&#8217;s case claiming the world&#8217;s
largest software maker unfairly used its monopoly on personal
computer operating systems to suppress WordPerfect, a rival
word-processing program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In defending the case in federal court in Salt Lake City,
Microsoft called Chairman Bill Gates as a witness last month.
Gates testified that he &#8220;absolutely&#8221; denied the central
allegation of Novell&#8217;s suit: that in 1994, in developing the
Windows 95 operating system, Microsoft blocked an element of the
software to thwart Novell&#8217;s WordPerfect and Quattro Pro
programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novell is seeking as much as $1.3 billion in damages, which
would be tripled under antitrust law. The company &#8220;wanted
nothing more than to compete on the merits of its products,&#8221;
the company&#8217;s lawyer, Jeffrey Johnson, told the jury. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decision to restrict outside programmers&#8217; access to
&#8220;extensions,&#8221; or programming code -- a decision that Novell
claims deliberately targeted WordPerfect and made it impossible
to run properly on Windows -- was made at a 1993 &#8220;high-level
executive retreat&#8221; at Hood Canal, Washington, Johnson told
jurors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gates&#8217;s testimony that the extensions were &#8220;trivial and
unimportant -- hardly worth his time&#8221; doesn&#8217;t withstand
scrutiny, Johnson said. Johnson revisited testimony and e-mails
presented at trial to argue the decision was a &#8220;purely
predatory action.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;It Was Important&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He wasn&#8217;t telling the truth,&#8221; Johnson said, referring to
Gates&#8217;s testimony. &#8220;It was important to him.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novell, which was bought by Seattle-based Attachmate Corp.
in April, has argued that WordPerfect&#8217;s share of the word-
processing market fell to less than 10 percent in 1996 from
almost 50 percent in 1990. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its value dropped from $1.2 billion in May 1994 to $170
million in 1996, when it was sold to Ottawa-based Corel Corp.,
said Novell. The company settled separate antitrust claims
against Microsoft for $536 million in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David B. Tulchin, a lawyer representing Microsoft, told
jurors that Novell &#8220;showed you not one document in which Novell
complained to Microsoft&#8221; about the blocked extensions in 1994
or 1995. A juror might conclude that a company facing $1 billion
of damages without the code at issue would &#8220;speak up,&#8221; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Boggles the Mind&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The essence of Novell&#8217;s claim is once an operating system
company sends out a beta version of the operating system, the
company that sent out that operating system is frozen -- can&#8217;t
make a change&#8221; without facing liability if it does, Tulchin
said. The argument &#8220;boggles the mind,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will never know&#8221; what would&#8217;ve happened if Novell had
asked Bill Gates to maintain access to the extensions, Tulchin
said. &#8220;They never did ask. Microsoft thought Novell was not
using them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jurors are scheduled to begin deliberations later today or
tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Novell Inc. v. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), 04-01045, U.S.
District Court, District of Utah (Salt Lake City). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The euro&#8217;s tumble below its weakest
levels against the dollar reached during October and November
suggests the 17-nation currency may weaken to its lowest level
this year, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you see an intraday break like this it&#8217;s a sign that
the market is weak and there is still a trend for the market to
go lower, until we see the euro get above the levels it broke
down today, which is $1.3145 and extends up to $1.3212,&#8221; said
Niall O&#8217;Connor, a New York-based technical analyst with
JPMorgan. &#8220;That we&#8217;ve broken some key chart levels is important
and suggests that there is still downside risk with potential to
extend to the January low.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro traded 0.8 percent weaker at $1.3080 at 12:22 p.m.
after earlier gaining as much as 0.4 percent versus the
greenback. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A break below $1.3047, the 61.8 percent Fibonacci
retracement level from a four-year low reached in June 2010, may
send the shared currency to the weakest this year, according to
O&#8217;Connor. The 2011 low is $1.2867, reached on Jan. 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some people will look at $1.30 as a mental level, but
there is nothing technical there stopping it,&#8221; O&#8217;Connor said.
&#8220;If we start breaking $1.2860, it&#8217;s hard to spin that in a
positive way.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Technical analysts who use the
Fibonacci ratios, described by Leonardo of Pisa in &#8220;Liber
Abaci&#8221; in 1202, believe the price of an asset may reverse an
earlier gain or decline after reaching certain levels. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan
Stanley (MS) are getting a chilly reception at top colleges,
including Harvard University and Princeton University, as campus
offshoots of Occupy Wall Street target investment-bank
recruiting events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs canceled visits to Harvard and Brown
University last week following a November incident where Occupy
Harvard protesters attempted to enter a recruitment session.
Students at Yale University, Princeton and Cornell University
have also rallied at campus events by investment firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students of the eight elite colleges composing the Ivy
League in the northeastern U.S., such as Sandra Korn of Harvard
and Tom Moore of Cornell, are criticizing their universities for
sending high numbers of graduates to Wall Street, rather than to
jobs that emphasize community service. Careers in financial and
consulting firms are frequently presented as the best or only
option, said Korn, a sophomore majoring in history of science
and gender studies who participated in the Nov. 28 protest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s kind of frustrating for students who think this is
not the most ethical profession,&#8221; Korn, 19, said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;When some people are making money by taking risks
with other people&#8217;s lives and livelihoods, that&#8217;s detrimental to
society.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 22 percent of Harvard 2011 graduates who planned to
enter the workforce were headed into finance and consulting,
down from a high of 47 percent in 2007, according to a Harvard
Crimson survey published in May. Half the students entering
those fields said they would have chosen to work in other
professions if salary weren&#8217;t a concern. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeting Blankfein &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 11 percent were planning for jobs in education,
and one in four were ticketed for graduate programs, according
to the survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Dec. 8 Goldman Sachs recruiting visit to the Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based university was canceled &#8220;due to proximity
to the Reading Period and commencement of exams,&#8221; according to
an e-mail obtained by Bloomberg News. A session days earlier on
Brown&#8217;s campus in Providence, Rhode Island, was scuttled hours
before it was to begin, the Brown Daily Herald reported Dec. 5.
Both sessions were rescheduled as Internet-based seminars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School,
canceled an October appearance at Barnard College in New York.
Students at Columbia University, with which Barnard is
affiliated, organized a weeklong protest against Blankfein, the
Columbia Daily Spectator reported on its website. Barnard
President Debora L. Spar joined Goldman Sachs&#8217;s board in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West Coast Shipping &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Wells, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman Sachs,
declined to comment on the campus protests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protests spawned by the Occupy Wall Street movement that
began in September have focused attention on Americans who lost
homes and jobs as credit froze after the bankruptcy of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008, contributing to the worst
recession since the Great Depression, even as many U.S. banks
rebounded. The movement that began in a New York park has spread
to cities worldwide including Boston, London, Sydney and
Toronto. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occupy demonstrators yesterday protested to halt shipping
operations at ports in Oakland and Long Beach, California, and
Portland, Oregon, where Goldman Sachs owns a stake in the
largest cargo-terminal operator. The economic value of
containerized cargo at West Coast ports is about $705 million a
day, according to Martin Associates, a Lancaster, Pennsylvania-
based consulting firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Job Opportunities &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;College students are saying that Wall Street banks haven&#8217;t
been held accountable for promoting the high-risk investments
that led to the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In general, they play a role in the crashing of the
economy and the broadening of the income distribution gap,&#8221;
said Luciana Chamorro, a senior at Princeton. &#8220;It&#8217;s the
maximization of profit at the expense of social equality.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chamorro said she&#8217;s been disappointed by the focus on Wall
Street and consulting jobs among the opportunities presented by
the Princeton, New Jersey-based university&#8217;s career office. She
was among about 20 students who interrupted a Dec. 7 JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) recruitment session on campus to voice their
concern. There were about 25 students there who had come to
learn about the investment bank, and five people from the
company, three of them recent Princeton graduates, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we seemed threatening in any way to them,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;We both gave each other the space to say what we
were thinking and I think that was really good.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yale&#8217;s Approach &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley experienced some &#8220;peripheral&#8221; protest
activity at an event at Yale in New Haven, Connecticut, last
month, said Jeanmarie McFadden, a spokeswoman for the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have not changed our recruitment activities and we
have not seen any impact on attendance,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yale respects the rights of students to protest peacefully,
said Allyson Moore, associate dean of Yale College and director
of career services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;None of the companies were distressed by it,&#8221; Moore
said. &#8220;They anticipated it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 11 percent of Yale undergraduates take jobs in
finance, less than the 18 percent that go to work in education,
Moore said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our philosophy is to support each individual student&#8217;s
career aspirations,&#8221; Moore said. &#8220;If they want a career in the
arts, we&#8217;ll do our level best to help them achieve that and if
they aspire to a career in business, we&#8217;ll work equally as
hard.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public Service &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Korn, the Harvard student, said she has slept in a tent in
Harvard Yard about 14 times as part of the Occupy protest. She
said she heard speeches by university President Drew Faust that
emphasized the importance of public-service careers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Faust, Harvard has increased opportunities and
support for students seeking experiences and careers in public
service, said Jeff Neal, a university spokesman. Efforts last
year included a series of new Presidential Public Service
Fellowships. She has also said that the university&#8217;s next
fundraising campaign will include increasing summer public-
service opportunities, according to Neal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Nov. 28, Korn said she and about 25 other Occupy Harvard
protesters tried to enter the Goldman Sachs event. She said a
staff member told her group they couldn&#8217;t enter because they
weren&#8217;t properly dressed and didn&#8217;t have resumes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protesters remained outside, chanting anti-Goldman
Sachs slogans, she said. Students who had come to hear the
bank&#8217;s presentation were unhappy, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There were certainly some students who were a little
annoyed,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strained Friendships &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colleges should consider banning corporate recruiting, as
they did military recruiters, as antithetical to the purposes of
a university, said Moore, the Cornell sophomore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a sense that they&#8217;re appealing to people who
don&#8217;t have a lot of options, that graduation is coming near and
debt is piling up,&#8221; Moore said. &#8220;People are becoming part of
this profoundly unjust institution because they don&#8217;t see an
alternative.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moore said his views have caused friction with classmates
interested in Wall Street jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;ve definitely had some friendships strained,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General Motors Co. (GM) may hasten plans
to increase output in China after regulators in the world&#8217;s
largest automobile market said they will impose punitive duties
on some vehicles imported from the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levies of as much as 12.9 percent for its autos &#8220;may
accelerate GM&#8217;s localization plans,&#8221; Himanshu Patel, a New
York-based analyst for JPMorgan Chase  Co., wrote in a note to
clients yesterday. The Detroit-based automaker already plans to
add local production and only 1.3 percent of GM&#8217;s 2.43 million
vehicles sold in China last year were imported, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s decision to increase import levies comes three
months after the World Trade Organization rejected its appeal of
a ruling backing U.S. duties on tire imports. China&#8217;s auto sales
are rising at the slowest pace in 13 years, pressuring local
producers to consolidate as foreign carmakers post gains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The move shows that China is always capable of
intervening politically in its markets,&#8221; said Juergen Pieper, a
Frankfurt-based analyst with Bankhaus Metzler. &#8220;The automobile
industry is very dependent on China for growth, and there&#8217;s
doubts about the pace of future expansion.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automakers declined on concern higher duties may soften
demand in the Chinese market, which LMC Automotive says may rise
to 21 million passenger-car sales by 2015. GM fell 3.2 percent
to $19.47 in New York trading, the lowest closing price since
its initial public offering in November 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Modest Impact&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tariffs will have a &#8220;modest impact&#8221; on GM, JPMorgan&#8217;s
Patel said, because most of the automaker&#8217;s vehicles imported to
China are low-volume models such as the Buick Enclave and
Cadillac SRX sport-utility vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our goal is to build where we sell,&#8221; Klaus-Peter Martin,
a company spokesman, said in a phone interview. About half of a
percentage point of sales in the region come from the GM&#8217;s North
American plants, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duties may be as much as 8.8 percent for Chrysler Group LLC,
the Auburn Hills, Michigan-based maker of Jeep SUVs, China&#8217;s
commerce ministry said yesterday on its website. The U.S. units
of Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) and Daimler AG (DAI) will face duties
of 2 percent and 2.7 percent respectively, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford Motor Co. (F) is not affected by the tariffs, Todd Nissen,
a company spokesman, said in an e-mail. The only vehicle Ford
imports into China is its Edge SUV built in Canada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2.5-Liter Engines &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The levies affect vehicles with engines that are above 2.5
liters in size, according to the ministry&#8217;s website. Honda Motor
Co. (7267)&#8217;s U.S. operations and other automakers the ministry didn&#8217;t
specify will also be subject to the tax. China currently imposes
tariffs of 25 percent on imported cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BMW leads automakers that have &#8220;material exposure&#8221; to the
duties with about 25,000 vehicles imported from North America,
Itay Michaeli, a New York-based analyst for Citigroup Inc.,
wrote in a note to clients. Chrysler imports about 24,000
primarily through its Jeep brand and Daimler imports about
18,000, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiat SpA (F), which controls Chrysler, declined 21 cents, or
5.5 percent, to 3.55 euros in Milan trading. BMW fell 5.1
percent to 50.25 euros, while Daimler dropped 3.1 percent to
31.66 euros in Frankfurt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WTO in September rejected China&#8217;s appeal of a ruling by
the organization&#8217;s judges last December that found tariffs on
$1.8 billion of car and light-truck tires from China were legal.
President Barack Obama imposed the duties of as much as 35
percent in September 2009 under a so-called safeguard provision
designed to protect U.S. producers from a surge in imports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Flawed&#8217; Investigation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s anti-dumping investigation into U.S. autos has been
flawed and the U.S. Trade Representative&#8217;s office is
&#8220;disappointed&#8221; with the planned duties, Andrea Mead, a
spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. The trade office will work with
Congress to find the best way to move forward, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;China&#8217;s actions are unjustifiable,&#8221; House Democrats
Sander Levin and Jim McDermott and Republicans Dave Camp and
Kevin Brady said yesterday in a joint statement. &#8220;This appears
to be just one more instance of impermissible Chinese
retaliation against the U.S. and other trading partners.&#8221; The
action &#8220;appears&#8221; to violate China&#8217;s WTO commitments, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BMW and Daimler&#8217;s Mercedes-Benz both build sport-utility
vehicles at U.S. factories for global export. BMW is expanding
its factory in South Carolina to produce as many as 300,000 X5,
X6, and X3 SUVs next year from 270,000 in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Daimler unit plans to invest $2.4 billion between 2010
and 2014 at its plant in Alabama to add equipment for the
assembly of the C-Class sedan. The company currently makes the
M-Class and GL SUVs as well as the R-Class wagon at the site.
The plant produced 125,400 vehicles in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Flummox&#8217; Buyers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is hardly going to flummox the buyer of a high-end
car,&#8221; said Namrita Chow, a senior analyst at IHS Automotive in
Shanghai. They&#8217;re really not going to be bothered by a few
percent here and there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BMW doesn&#8217;t expect the new import duties to have a
significant impact on its sales in China, Mathias Schmidt, a
spokesman, said by phone, adding that the failure to resolve the
trade dispute was &#8220;regrettable.&#8221; Daimler&#8217;s Mercedes is
reviewing the potential impact from the duties, said Bettina Singhartinger, a spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrysler sold 23,482 vehicles in China last year and aimed
to increase deliveries to 40,000 this year, the company has said.
The automaker declined to provide updated China sales results
for 2011. Ariel Gavilan, a company spokesman, declined to
comment on what affect the new duties may have on profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sales Pace &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s passenger-car sales rose at the slowest pace in six
months in November, as monetary tightening and the removal of
government incentives dented demand. Wholesale deliveries,
including sport-utility vehicles and minivans, gained 0.3
percent to 1.34 million last month, the China Association of
Automobile Manufacturers said Dec. 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s vehicle sales have slowed this year from 2010&#8217;s
record 32 percent expansion as inflation, higher interest rates
and the end of a two-year stimulus plan deter purchases. Chinese
deliveries may expand at a slower pace than U.S. light vehicle
sales for the first time since at least 1998, according to the
Chinese trade group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercedes is discounting locally produced vehicles in China
by 6 percent to 10 percent, while BMW is offering some &#8220;small
discounts&#8221; on inventory that is more than six months old, Jose Asumendi, a Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc analyst, said in a
note to investors yesterday, citing dealer visits in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volkswagen AG (VOW) is discounting imported vehicles by 5 percent,
and offering limited or no discounts for locally produced cars,
Asumendi said. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Christine Harper and Zachary Mider" date="Dec 14, 2011  6:08 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-12-14/goldman-loses-at-least-37-partners-in-weakest-year-since-2008.html"><headline>Goldman Loses at Least 37 Partners in Weakest Year Since 2008</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, has lost at least 38 partners in
2011 as the firm heads toward the end of its worst year for
profit and share performance since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number is an estimate based on internal memos, company
filings and news reports as the New York-based bank doesn&#8217;t
publicize departures. The company added nine partners from
outside the firm this year, including six when Goldman Sachs
took full control of its Australian joint venture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, more than a dozen years since its initial
public offering, still promotes top performers every even-
numbered year to join a so-called partnership and share in a
bonus pool that&#8217;s envied on Wall Street. Partners swelled to 475
last year from 221 as of the IPO. They&#8217;re among the biggest
shareholders, with a combined stake of about 13.8 percent on
Nov. 20, up from 10.2 percent on Jan. 27, filings show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I retired from GS after a fantastic 15 years entirely for
family reasons,&#8221; Robert A. McTamaney, who was named partner in
2002, said in an e-mailed response to questions after confirming
that he stepped down in June. &#8220;I plan to do something on my own
related to helping people manage their money.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The retirement of McTamaney, a U.S. citizen who helped run
the equities trading business in Asia after being co-head of
global foreign exchange and European emerging markets trading
from London, is among those that haven&#8217;t been reported. Others
include Ken N. Murphy, Dioscoro-Roy I. Ramos, Gary B. Schermerhorn, Devesh P. Shah and David H. Voon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Good Fortune&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These guys have created a pretty good fortune and they&#8217;ve
got liquidity and can move out in a way that they couldn&#8217;t when
they were a partnership,&#8221; said Jay W. Lorsch, a Harvard
Business School professor who helped run an education program
for new partners in the 1980s. It&#8217;s not &#8220;a huge number&#8221; of
retirements as it&#8217;s less than 10 percent of the total, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks face new regulations and capital requirements that
may crimp profits. Protests, some aimed at Goldman Sachs, have
decried Wall Street bonuses after taxpayers rescued the
financial system in 2008. Demonstrators have disrupted bank
recruiting on college campuses and about 250 gathered this week
in front of the company&#8217;s headquarters chanting &#8220;Take the ax to
Goldman Sachs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs shares have dropped 45 percent this year and
net earnings tumbled 43 percent in the nine months ended Sept.
30. The company set aside $10 billion for compensation in the
first three quarters, enough to pay each worker $292,836 for the
period, down from $370,706 a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highest-Paid &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partners, typically the highest-paid employees, receive
most of their compensation in stock and must hold at least a
quarter of the after-tax shares they receive from the company
until they retire, according to a proxy statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs promoted 110 people to partner last year, the
second-largest class after 115 people were added in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm, with 34,200 employees at the end of September,
has said it aims to trim $1.2 billion in annual expenses, which
could lead to at least 1,000 job cuts. Some of the partner
departures, including retirements, may be tied to the cost-
saving effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New partners include Daniel P. Petrozzo, chief information
officer at Fidelity Investments before joining Goldman Sachs in
June, and Boston Consulting Group Chairman Carl Stern, 65, who
became a Chicago-based vice chairman in the investment-banking
division in September, according to company filings and LinkedIn
profiles. Ronald Hua, a citizen of the U.S. and Taiwan, joined
in September as chief investment officer and head of the
quantitative equity alpha business within asset management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class of &#8216;88 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs doesn&#8217;t publish statistics on how many
partners leave each year and the company stopped announcing
partner promotions in press releases after 2006. David Wells, a
spokesman for the firm, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five people who left or are leaving this year became
partners before the 1999 IPO, including Milton R. Berlinski, 55,
who heads the team that advises private-equity firms. Berlinski,
who became a partner in 1996, is stepping down at year-end, he
said in an interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The departure of Kevin W. Kennedy, 63, who became partner
in 1984, leaves Goldman Sachs with two partners from that
decade, both from the class of 1988: Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 57, and John P. Curtin Jr., 61, a U.S. citizen who is the Toronto-based chairman and
CEO of the firm&#8217;s Canadian business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy is one of four members of the management committee
who will be gone by year-end, along with Yusuf A. Alireza,
Edward C. Forst and Richard M. Ruzika. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Terribly Hard&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The work is terribly hard and so people don&#8217;t stay around
usually in this line of work for all that long,&#8221; Charles D. Ellis, author of the 2008 book &#8220;The Partnership: The Making of
Goldman Sachs,&#8221; said in a telephone interview. &#8220;The intensity
gets to you.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some partners who retire maintain ties to the company
through business relationships, alumni events or so-called
advisory-director or senior-director roles. An example is Joseph H. Gleberman, who worked at Goldman Sachs for more than 29 years
and became a partner in 1990. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gleberman, who most recently was chief risk officer for the
company&#8217;s merchant-banking division, said he will serve as an
advisory director on the investment committee after retiring at
year-end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;ve had a very gratifying career at GS but I decided
that if I was going to have a significant next career
(unidentified as yet), now was the time to make the change,&#8221; he
wrote in response to an e-mailed question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is a list of Goldman Sachs partners who left or
are leaving this year: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Phillips Chemical Co., a
joint venture equally owned by Chevron Corp. (CVX) and ConocoPhillips (COP),
will spend about $5 billion to build one of the first new
ethylene production facilities in the U.S. since 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company selected its site in Baytown, Texas, for new
factories to convert ethane into ethylene starting in 2017, The
Woodlands, Texas-based Chevron Phillips said today in a
statement. The cost includes an ethylene plant, known as a
cracker, capable of producing 1.5 million metric tons of the
gaseous chemical a year, and two plants for making polyethylene
plastic, said Melanie Samuelson, a company spokeswoman in an
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry is investing in U.S. production of ethylene,
the most widely used petrochemical, as natural gas costs have
dropped. Ethane is derived from gas, which has dropped in price
as new technologies have boosted production from shale
formations. The U.S. has a cost advantage relative to producers
in Asia and Europe where ethylene is made from oil-derived
naphtha. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased that the development of shale-gas
resources in the U.S. has set the stage for major petrochemical
investment and job creation in our backyard,&#8221; Peter L. Cella,
chief executive officer of Chevron Phillips, said in the
statement. The chemical company announced in March plans to
consider the project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pipeline Access &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Phillips plans to convert ethylene from its new
cracker into 1 billion metric tons a year of polyethylene at
plants to be built at either the company&#8217;s Cedar Bayou site in
Baytown or at the nearby Sweeny site in Old Ocean. A final
selection will be made by March, the company said. Polyethylene
is a plastic used in grocery bags and food packaging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shaw Energy  Chemicals Ltd. is designing the ethane
cracker. Federal and state permit applications for air emissions
will be filed this week, with approvals anticipated in 2013,
according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Phillips said it chose to build adjacent to an
existing cracker in Baytown, located about 30 miles (48
kilometers) east of downtown Houston, because the site has
access to ethane and ethylene pipelines and storage caverns, as
well as to the Mont Belvieu gas-processing hub. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plants will employ 400 people and the construction
project will create 10,000 jobs, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dow Chemical Co. (DOW), the world&#8217;s largest ethylene producer,
plans to spend $4 billion in the U.S. to build a Gulf Coast
cracker by 2017, two propylene plants and to reopen an idled
Louisiana cracker. Sasol Ltd. (SOL) may spend as much as $4.5 billion
to build a cracker and related plants in Louisiana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LyondellBasell Industries NV is among companies expanding
existing U.S. facilities to benefit from low-cost ethane. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG)
should halt operations in Brazil and pay 20 billion reais ($10.7
billion) in damages after an oil spill last month, prosecutors
urged a federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron and Transocean weren&#8217;t capable of controlling the
damages from a spill of 3,000 barrels of oil, which proves a
lack of environmental planning and management,&#8221; the federal
prosecutors&#8217; office in Campos, Rio de Janeiro state, said today
in a statement on the Federal Public Ministry&#8217;s website. The
prosecutors didn&#8217;t say in which court the suit was filed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the second-largest U.S. crude producer after Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM), is being audited by Brazil&#8217;s petroleum regulator
for the oil leak at the Frade project off the coast of Rio de
Janeiro last month. Brazil has tightened safety conditions at
crude projects following the spill at BP Plc&#8217;s Macondo well in
the Gulf of Mexico last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian prosecutors said in today&#8217;s statement they are
asking a court to immediately suspend Chevron and Transocean&#8217;s
operations in the country and order a &#8220;definitive halt&#8221; after
assessing the case. A court must rule on the request and the
damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transocean, the operator of the rig at Chevron&#8217;s Frade
project, &#8220;continues to cooperate with the authorities,&#8221; Guy
Cantwell, a spokesman, said in a telephone interview from
Houston. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t seen anything in writing,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s U.K. arm
hired a French-speaking markets regulator from Britain&#8217;s
Financial Services Authority, as rule-setting powers move from
London to Paris and Brussels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank hired Martine Doyon, a specialist in European
Union market rules and an international strategist for the
regulator, to head up its EU government-affairs department, an
FSA spokesman said in a telephone interview. She becomes at
least the ninth senior official to leave the regulator since the
government said in 2010 it would abolish the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A French or German speaker is probably a good place to
start&#8221; in recruiting a lobbyist, Fred Ponzo, an adviser on
capital-markets regulation at Greyspark Partners, said in a
telephone interview in London. A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU, led by its internal markets commissioner and the
former French foreign minister, Michel Barnier, is in the
process of overhauling laws governing financial firms, including
a review of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and
derivatives legislation. The Paris-based European Securities and
Markets Authority was set up earlier this year to harmonize
implementation of the new market rules across the 27 nations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hire comes after the U.K. regulator lost Alan Cathcart,
a senior official who worked on banking stress tests, to HSBC
Holdings Plc. (HSBA) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EY, JPMorgan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Huertas, formerly the head of the U.K. watchdog&#8217;s
international group, is set to start work at accounting firm
Ernst  Young in January. Sally Dewar, the FSA managing director
for risk, resigned last year to join JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSA restructured into two divisions to prepare for a
government-mandated handover of lender supervision to the Bank
of England and the creation of the Financial Conduct Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s U.S. arm last year hired Theo Lubke, who
previously headed the Federal Reserve Bank of New York&#8217;s efforts
to reform the private derivatives market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MF Global Holdings Inc. won court
permission to use about $21 million in cash collateral of its
largest lender, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), as a judge suggested a
probe to find out whether some of the funds may belong to
customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn in Manhattan today
overruled objections from customers who said the money could be
part of the $1.2 billion missing from their segregated accounts.
MF Global had reached an agreement with the New York-based bank
about how it would use the cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Proof, not speculation. I understand this is a fluid
situation but you have to acknowledge at this point that there
is no proof the money in the account is customer property,&#8221;
Glenn said. He said he would issue a written order and elaborate
whether the company&#8217;s Chapter 11 trustee, Louis Freeh, should
investigate the source of the funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, agent to a $1.2 billion loan, agreed at the
outset of MF Global&#8217;s bankruptcy to let it use $26 million
subject to an agreement that gives the bank a lien on all of MF
Global&#8217;s assets. Freeh said in court papers that the money,
exactly $25.3 million, is presumed to be that of the company,
not that of customers. About $4 million is set aside to cover
fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrong-Way Trade &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global Holdings, once run by former New Jersey Governor
and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) co-chairman Jon Corzine, filed the
eighth-largest U.S. bankruptcy after a wrong-way $6.3 billion
trade on its own behalf on bonds of some of Europe&#8217;s most
indebted nations. About $1.2 billion may be missing from
segregated customer accounts, according to James Giddens, the
trustee liquidating the company&#8217;s brokerage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers of the failed brokerage objected to the proposed
use of cash in court papers, citing news reports that $200
million of the missing funds may have been transferred to
JPMorgan accounts and that there had been commingling of
customer segregated funds. In light of that, MF Global shouldn&#8217;t
be allowed to commit more of its collateral, which is the
property of customers, not JPMorgan, said James Koutoulas, a
lawyer for the Commodity Customer Coalition, a group formed out
of the brokerage&#8217;s liquidation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koutoulas, the remaining objector, said at today&#8217;s hearing
that the order allowing MF Global to use the cash has no
provision that will allow it to be returned to customers if it&#8217;s
found to be part of their missing $1.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refund &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the money&#8217;s spent, you can&#8217;t unspend it, I don&#8217;t see
the Trustee giving customers a refund,&#8221; Koutoulas told Glenn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koutoulas cited testimony at yesterday&#8217;s hearing before the
Senate from CME Group Inc. chairman Terrence Duffy that at least
$175 million was transferred from customer accounts to house
accounts, and said JPMorgan could gain an advantage by letting
MF Global use the funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Why should this bank get another bailout on customers&#8217;
backs?&#8221; Koutoulas said to Glenn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glenn said customer property would be protected if it was
found to be in the parent company&#8217;s accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global Holdings filed for bankruptcy to apportion
returns to creditors, including bondholders and lenders such as
JPMorgan, while Giddens is overseeing distributions to customers
at MF Global Inc. Giddens has set in motion distributions that
will return around 72 percent to customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global Holdings&#8217; Oct. 31 bankruptcy filing listed assets
of $41 billion and debt of $39.7 billion. Corzine quit as CEO on
Nov. 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brokerage case is Securities Investor Protection Corp.
v. MF Global Inc., 11-02790, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). The parent&#8217;s bankruptcy case
is MF Global Holdings Ltd., 11-bk-15059, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. removed
Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN), Turkey&#8217;s biggest bank by market
value, from its &#8216;&#8216;focus-sell&#8217;&#8217; list after the share&#8217;s recent
&#8216;&#8216;underperformance.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garanti&#8217;s earnings should be boosted by higher inflation in
the fourth quarter, due to the inflation-linked bonds the bank
owns, Goldman analysts including Waleed Mohsin in Dubai said in
an e-mailed report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;Pressure on Garanti&#8217;s shares could ease post
underperformance, as recent stronger CPI prints should boost
fourth-quarter earnings,&#8221; the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garanti&#8217;s rating remained at &#8220;sell&#8217; with a price estimate
of 6.53 liras, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares in Garanti fell 2.7 percent to 5.86 liras at 5:13

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world&#8217;s largest
soft-drink maker, agreed to acquire about half of the equity in
the beverage business of Saudi Arabia-based Aujan Industries in
what the companies described as a $980 million transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola will purchase 50 percent of the Aujan entity that
holds the rights to the Rani and Barbican brands and 49 percent
of Aujan&#8217;s bottling and distribution unit, the companies said
today in a statement. The deal, which excludes Aujan&#8217;s Iranian
manufacturing and distribution business, is expected to close in
the first half of 2012, the companies said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Middle East is a high-growth region with some of the
highest rates of non-alcoholic ready-to-drink per-capita
consumption,&#8221; Ahmet C. Bozer, Coca-Cola&#8217;s group president for
Eurasia and Africa, said in the statement. &#8220;This transaction
creates a platform for further cooperation between Coca-Cola
Co., Aujan and existing bottling partners across the region.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal will give Atlanta-based Coca-Cola a stake in one
of the Middle East&#8217;s leading soft-drink businesses and provide
closely held Aujan with a platform to accelerate the
international growth of brands including Rani and Barbican, the
companies said. Royal Bank of Scotland Plc (RBS) advised Aujan on the
transaction, the beverage company said in a separate statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aujan, established in 1905 as a commodities trading firm,
is one of the 100 biggest companies in Saudi Arabia, employing
more than 2,500 people. Revenue will exceed $850 million this
year, more than double the figure reached in 2007, Aujan said.
The company also holds the license for Nichols Plc-owned Vimto
in the Middle East via its bottling and distribution unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antoine Tayyar, a spokesman for Coca-Cola in the Middle
East, and Kent Landers, a spokesman for Coca-Cola in the U.S.,

&lt;p&gt;Website Operator Says He Doesn&#8217;t Infringe MGM Resorts Trademarks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the website operators that MGM Resorts International
sued for trademark infringement Dec. 1 denied the allegations in
a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam Majewski of McKinney, Texas, filed a motion to dismiss
the case Dec. 8. He said MGM&#8217;s claims that he infringed the
trademarks associated with the company&#8217;s Excalibur hotel won&#8217;t
hold up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Excalibur is not a distinctive mark,&#8221; he said. He noted
that &#8220;thousands of businesses own this name -- Excalibur
bowling, Excalibur Taxi and even Excalibur condoms.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Majewski said in court papers he chose the name
&#8220;&#8216;excaliburpoker.com&#8221; for his online poker platform to
distinguish it from other online piker sites. &#8220;I believed the
medieval theme would make my site distinctive,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says his website doesn&#8217;t compete with the Excalibur
hotel, doesn&#8217;t divert potential customers and &#8220;has not harmed
the hotel in any way.&#8221; Additionally, he claimed he deliberately
stayed away from Nevada &#8220;under the theory that demand would be
weak since gamers in Nevada can go out and get the real thing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Majewski asked that the case be dismissed, or
alternatively, be transferred to federal court in Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Dec. 2, U.S. District Judge Philip M. Pro issued a
temporary order locking up the domain names to which MGM had
objected in its original complaint. That order extended to
Majewski&#8217;s excaliburpower.com site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Las Vegas-based MGM Resorts International (MGM) is represented by
Michael J. McCue, Jonathan W. Fountain and John L. Krieger of
Phoenix-based Lewis  Roca LLP. Majewski is unrepresented by
counsel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is MGM Resorts International Operations Inc. v.
Kolahzadeh, 2:11-cv-01929-PMP-CWH, U.S. District Court, District
of Nevada (Las Vegas). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steelers&#8217; &#8216;Terrible Towel&#8217; Trademark Infringed, Judge Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pittsburgh Steelers National Football League team&#8217;s
&#8220;Terrible Towel&#8221; trademarks were infringed by a t-shirt maker,
a federal court ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team, which has the exclusive license to the mark owned
by the Allegheny Valley School Foundation, objected to a company
selling shirts with a &#8220;Terrible T-shirt&#8221; design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Dec. 6 ruling, U.S. District Judge Arthur J. Schwab
noted that the mark had been used by Steeler fans for the past
35 years. The mark originated with the late Pittsburgh sports
journalist Myron Cope, who registered the mark and then assigned
it to the foundation, a nonprofit group that provided services
to intellectually and developmentally disabled people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit was triggered by the t-shirt company&#8217;s application
to register &#8220;The Terrible T-shirt&#8221; as a trademark with the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Despite the cease-and-desist
letter the team sent the shirt company, t-shirts were printed
bearing that slogan, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Schwab said the mark is valid and well known, and
that the public would likely mistakenly assume an affiliation
existed between the t-shirt maker and the trademark holder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team and the foundation were represented by Bernard M.
Schneider of Brucker Schneider  Porter of Pittsburgh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is AVS Foundation V. Eugene Berry Enterprise LLC,
2:11-cv-01084-AJS, U.S. District Court, Western District of
Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tea Party Patriots Win Ruling Clarifying Trademark Ownership &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tea Party Patriots Inc., a conservative political group
based in Atlanta, won a trademark dispute with a former member
of its board of directors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a statement released by the group&#8217;s law firm,
Amy Kremer, who had helped form the group in 2009, had claimed
the group&#8217;s name and websites were hers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tea Party group filed a trademark suit in Georgia state
court in October 2009 seeking a court ruling that it owned the
trademarks and related IP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deborah Ausburn of Atlanta&#8217;s Taylor English Duma LLP
represented the Tea Party Patriots, and said that the jury
&#8220;recognized that when a group of people, including Ms. Kremer,
work as part of an organization, it is unfair for one individual
to claim rights to everyone&#8217;s work.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yahoo Denies Infringing Singapore Press&#8217;s Copyright, Sues &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo! Inc., accused by Singapore Press Holdings Ltd. (SPH) of
reproducing news content without its permission, denied
infringing the city-state&#8217;s copyright laws and countersued the
newspaper publisher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The articles that Singapore Press claimed were reproduced
without authorization were insubstantial and insignificant,
Yahoo&#8217;s Southeast Asia unit said in a defense filed in the
Singapore High Court yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is an important public interest in respect of the
right of the public to be informed of current events in
Singapore,&#8221; the Sunnyvale, California-based Internet company
said in its filing. &#8220;Copyright law does not protect facts and
information.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Singapore-based newspaper publisher sued Yahoo last
month, seeking unspecified damages for alleged copyright
infringement of 23 articles from newspapers including the
Straits Times from November 2010 to October 2011. Yahoo claimed
in its countersuit that Singapore Press infringed its copyrights
by reproducing articles and images on a website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chin Soo Fang, a spokeswoman at Singapore Press, the city&#8217;s
largest publisher, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mail or
return a call to her office seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo approached Singapore Press in April 2009 for a
license to reproduce news content, and negotiations between the
two companies broke down last year, according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singapore Press deliberately kept silent until its lawyers
sent a letter on Nov. 4, causing Yahoo to continue with the
alleged infringement for a year as it believed the publisher had
no complaints, according to the Internet company&#8217;s filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Singapore Press Holdings Ltd. v Yahoo!
Southeast Asia Ltd., S831/2011, Singapore High Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China to Increase Fines for Counterfeiting to Deter Piracy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China, poised to become the world&#8217;s largest market for
pirated software, will increase fines and punishments for
counterfeiters better deter offenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nation will impose flexible fines that are multiple the
value of infringed goods, moving away from fixed amounts, Vice
Chinese Commerce Minister Jiang Zengwei said at a briefing in
Beijing yesterday. China will amend its criminal law to make it
more effective in fighting piracy, and improve evidence rules to
aid owners of intellectual property, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moves build on a pledge by Vice Premier Wang Qishan
last month to improve monitoring of intellectual property rights
in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are working to amend the relevant laws and regulations
to increase punitive measures against law breakers so that they
will bear the corresponding legal responsibility for their
crimes of infringement and counterfeiting,&#8221; said Jiang, who is
also office dean of China&#8217;s National Leading Group for Combating
IPR Infringement and Counterfeits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost four out of five computer programs used in China are
pirated, according to the annual report of the Business Software
Alliance, a Washington-based trade group representing companies
in the software industry, including Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Apple
Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central government has &#8220;greatly pushed forward&#8221; its
effort to use legal software nationwide, including the adoption
of licensed programs at 135 state departments and some
provincial governments, the State Council said in a statement
distributed before Jiang&#8217;s briefing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $7.78 billion commercial value of software pirated in
China last year was second only to the $9.52 billion lost in the
U.S., the alliance said. Only 20 percent of software in the U.S.
is pirated, compared with 78 percent in China, according to the
BSA&#8217;s report issued in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the percentage of pirated software in China has
declined, from 79 percent in 2009 and 92 percent in 2003, its
value has increased as the Chinese software market expanded, the
report showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese authorities investigated 16,000 cases of
counterfeiting involving 13.12 billion yuan ($2.1 billion) of
goods during the government&#8217;s &#8220;Sharp Sword&#8221; campaign, said the
State Council, China&#8217;s cabinet. The campaign, from October 2010
to June 2011, led to prosecution in 2,176 cases, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China will deploy enforcement inspections during the New
Year and Lunar New Year holidays, according to the cabinet
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Websites involved in counterfeiting and infringement will
be &#8220;rectified&#8221; and companies producing unauthorized
duplications of CDs and DVDs will be &#8220;sorted out,&#8221; the State
Council said. China will also crack down on the import and
export of counterfeit foods and drugs, it said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cleaning Products Disclosure Bill Has Trade Secrets Exceptions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legislation introduced by U.S. Representative Steve Israel,
a Democrat representing New York&#8217;s Long Island, will require the
listing on the label of all ingredients in consumer cleaning
items. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H.B. 3457, introduced Nov. 17, would mandate the listing in
order of predominance of all ingredients in cleaning products,
including those in dyes, fragrances and preservatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measure does contain exemptions for ingredients present
in undetectable levels and those that the manufacturer can
demonstrate to the Consumer Product Safety Commission that it is
a trade secret. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No ingredient can be claimed as a trade secret if it is
publicly known to be in the product, can be discovered through
&#8220;a standard process&#8221; of reverse engineering, or is deemed a
hazardous substance, according to the text of the bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Products covered by this measure would include air
fresheners, automotive cleaning products, and any cleaning
product used in the home, with the exception of personal care
items or cosmetics, pesticides and disinfectants used on certain
kinds of &#8220;critical or semi-critical devices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Can Protect Shale-Gas Drilling Secret in Bulgaria &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulgaria&#8217;s contract with San Ramon, California&#8217;s Chevron
Corp. (CVX) for shale gas exploration and production contains trade
secret elements and can&#8217;t be fully revealed to the public,
Traicho Traikov, the country&#8217;s minister of economy, energy and
tourism said and Bulgaria&#8217;s Novinite.com news agency reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traikov told Bulgaria&#8217;s parliament that while the trade
secret elements will be withheld, his ministry is engaging in
talks with Chevron to make public as much of the agreement as
possible, according to Novinite.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also said that the submission of a shale gas drilling
plan should be compulsory before shale gas permits are awarded,
Novinite.com reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conditions of approval, Traikov told parliament, included a
program disclosing the method of extraction and its
environmental impact, according to Novinite.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hackers Seeking Chemical Industry Secrets Masquerade as Symantec (SYMC) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hackers who targeted the gas industry earlier this year in
an attempt to get credentials allowing them access to companies&#8217;
proprietary data are still targeting chemical companies,
according to a posting on the Symantec Corp. blog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of October, Symantec issued a report on the
Nitro attacks. It said the attacks were focused on the chemical
industry with the goal of &#8220;obtaining sensitive documents such
as proprietary designs, formulas and manufacturing processes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mountain View, California-based computer-security
company said the so-called Nitro Attacks Group is now sending
the companies an e-mail that purports to be from Symantec itself
and offer protection from the &#8220;Poison Ivy Trojan&#8221; virus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symantec posted on its blog a screen capture of an email
purporting to come from its technical support department with
the heading &#8220;Symantec Security Warning!&#8221; The bogus e-mail says
&#8220;recently poison Ivy Trojan horse rampant, many enterprises are
infected. Symantec has launched a special kill poison Ivy Trojan
anti-virus software -- Symantec Endpoint Protection 12.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That e-mail also contains a clickable link, and notes that
the password to launch the file is &#8220;Symantec.&#8221; That link
contains a malicious executable file that could enable
unauthorized access to a company&#8217;s servers, according to the
computer security company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symantec said it has contacted the provider that hosts the
Internet protocol address used by the Nitro Attack Group and
that the e-mails are now being blocked through the .cloud e-mail
scanning service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IP Moves &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sidley Austin Snares Patent Litigator From Greenberg Traurig &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sidley Austin LLP hired Vernon M. Winters for its IP
practice, the Chicago-based firm said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winters, a patent litigator, joins from New York&#8217;s

&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) reached a settlement
with MBIA Inc. (MBI) over credit-default swaps that led to billions of
dollars of losses for the bank, agreeing to terminate the
contracts and drop a challenge to the insurer&#8217;s restructuring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MBIA will make a $1.1 billion cash payment to Morgan
Stanley as part of the settlement, according to a person
familiar with the agreement who asked not to be named because
the amount hasn&#8217;t been made public. Morgan Stanley will take a
$1.2 billion loss this quarter related to the deal, the New
York-based bank said yesterday in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley&#8217;s exposure to MBIA, and its attempts to
hedge those risks, have resulted in losses of about $3 billion
since the start of 2008, not including yesterday&#8217;s announcement.
The settlement will increase Morgan Stanley&#8217;s capital, boosting
the Tier 1 common ratio under new rules by about 75 basis
points, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s critical that we reposition for the new regulatory
environment and do so quickly,&#8221; Morgan Stanley Chief Executive
Officer James Gorman said in the statement. &#8220;A top priority for
2011 was to address this large outstanding legacy exposure and
this settlement is consistent with our efforts to build capital
and de-risk the balance sheet.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement &#8220;removes a legal headache, and should give a
boost to Morgan&#8217;s balance-sheet efficiency&#8221; Glenn Schorr, an
analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc., said in a note to investors.
The deal &#8220;could also cause the firm&#8217;s CDS spread to tighten as
earnings volatility should decline,&#8221; Schorr said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MBIA, based in Armonk, New York, will withdraw a suit
against Morgan Stanley relating to $223 million of residential
mortgage-backed securities. Morgan Stanley plans to end its
participation in litigation challenging the split of the
insurer&#8217;s business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This settlement is good for Morgan Stanley, good for MBIA
and good for the markets and our financial system, allowing
firms to move forward and rebuild,&#8221; Benjamin Lawsky, New York
state&#8217;s financial services superintendent, said in a separate
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Brown, a spokesman for MBIA, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syracuse University, Boeheim Sued Over Fine Sex-Abuse Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syracuse University and its head basketball coach, Jim
Boeheim, were sued by two men claiming &#8220;years of sexual
molestation&#8221; at the hands of former assistant coach Bernie
Fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert &#8220;Bobby&#8221; Davis, 39, of Onondaga County, New York,
and his stepbrother Michael Lang, of Oswego County, who both
served as ball boys for the Syracuse basketball program, filed a
complaint yesterday in New York State Supreme Court in
Manhattan. Fine was sued on Dec. 8 in Pennsylvania state court
by Zach Tomaselli, who said he was abused by the coach as a 13-
year-old in a Pittsburgh hotel room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The sexual abuse occurred in Fine&#8217;s office at Manley
Field House, a short distance from (and for years, next door to)
Boeheim&#8217;s office,&#8221; lawyers for Davis and Lang said in their
complaint. &#8220;It occurred on team trips to other cities for away
games, including when the team attended and participated in the
Final Four; it occurred at a fraternity house on campus where
Fine was a supervisor; and it occurred in Fine&#8217;s car and in his
home.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syracuse fired Fine, who was in his 36th season at the
upstate New York university, on Nov. 27 after he was accused of
sexually abusing the two former ball boys. Onondaga County
District Attorney William Fitzpatrick said on Dec. 8 that Fine
won&#8217;t face charges related to those allegations because the
claims are too old to prosecute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott McDowell, a spokesman for Syracuse University, said
in a e-mail that the school is declining to comment on the
lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ted Feeley, a spokesman for the Syracuse athletic
department, declined to comment on the lawsuit. William Albert,
a spokesman for Harris Beach Pllc, a Pittsford, New York-based
law firm representing Fine, didn&#8217;t respond to messages seeking
comment. Fine has denied wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Davis v. Syracuse University, 113967/2011, New
York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Madoff Trustee Sues Credit Suisse to Recover $375 Million &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) was sued by the trustee liquidating
Bernard Madoff&#8217;s former investment firm to recover $375 million
in redemptions that were taken out of con man&#8217;s company before
his Ponzi scheme was exposed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trustee Irving Picard filed an adversary complaint
yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan for the return
of funds transferred to the Swiss bank by investors in Fairfield
Sentry Ltd. and Kingate Global Fund Ltd. The two so-called
feeder funds, which invested almost all their assets with
Madoff, are now in liquidation themselves, Picard said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, who pleaded guilty to fraud charges, is serving 150
years in prison for the largest Ponzi scheme in U.S. history.
Investors lost about $19 billion in principal, Picard has said.
Picard has filed similar lawsuits to recover investments taken
out of Madoff&#8217;s firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While we are still reviewing the complaint, there is no
allegation that CS did anything wrong,&#8221; Victoria Harmon, a
spokeswoman for Zurich-based Credit Suisse, said in an e-mail.
&#8220;This is simply another of the numerous claims the trustee has
filed in an attempt to clawback further funds.&#8221; &#8236; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. Credit Suisse, 11-02925, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Siemens Executives Charged in Argentine ID Bribery Scheme &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight former executives at Siemens AG, Europe&#8217;s largest
engineering company, were charged by the U.S. with conspiring to
bribe Argentine government officials to land a $1 billion
contract to make national identity cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. said the former executives ran a decade-long
scheme to pay more than $100 million in bribes to officials
including cabinet ministers and presidents to win the contract,
and to cover their tracks so the fraud wouldn&#8217;t be exposed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The counts against the former officials include conspiracy
to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the wire-fraud
statute, money laundering conspiracy and wire fraud, according
to an indictment unsealed yesterday in Manhattan federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case showed &#8220;corruption on an absolutely stunning
scale,&#8221; Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer said in a call
with reporters yesterday. &#8220;This is the first time we have so
many defendants charged with this fraud.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defendants in the criminal case are Uriel Sharef, 67, a
former member of the managing board of Munich-based Siemens;
Herbert Steffen, 74, Andres Truppel, 57, Ulrich Bock, 68,
Eberhard Reichert, 74, Stephan Signer, 51, Carlos Sergi, 78, and
Miguel Czysch, 79. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ninth executive, Bernd Regendantz, was named in a related
complaint filed yesterday by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission and not charged with a crime. Czysch and Reichert,
who were charged criminally, aren&#8217;t named as defendants in the
SEC complaint, which was also filed in Manhattan federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The company is not indicted,&#8221; said Alexander Becker, a
Siemens spokesman. &#8220;We can&#8217;t comment on proceedings against
individuals.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC claims that executives of Siemens and its Argentine
subsidiary bribed officials in Argentina from 1996 to 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steffen&#8217;s attorney, Steffen Ufer, said that his client
denies wrongdoing and that he settled an investigation of the
same issues with prosecutors in Munich. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharef&#8217;s lawyer, Heiko Lesch, and Hans Dieter Gross, who
represents Bock, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan Olaf Leisner, who represents Truppel, and Eberhard
Zeeb, Signer&#8217;s lawyer, didn&#8217;t reply to e-mails seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He acted honorably at all points in the investigation and
in the best interest of Siemens, where he continues to work, and
he will not be named criminally,&#8221; Regendantz&#8217;s lawyer, Nicholas
De Feis, said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. Sharef, 11-01056, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The
civil case is U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v. Sharef,
11-CV-9073, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kraft, Kellogg Sue Egg Companies Claiming Antitrust Breach &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kellogg Co. (K), General Mills Inc. (GIS) and units of Kraft Foods
Inc. (KFT) and Nestle (NESN) SA sued Cal-Maine Foods Inc. (CALM) and 10 more egg
producers for allegedly conspiring to control prices and
supplies in violation of antitrust laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs, among the world&#8217;s biggest makers of
packaged food, said in a complaint filed Dec. 12 in federal
court in Chicago that they suffered damages as a result of the
alleged conspiracy to control the supply of eggs and to
artificially maintain and increase pricing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Defendants and their co-conspirators controlled and
manipulated capacity for production of eggs and egg products,&#8221;
according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies are seeking a court order barring the egg
producers&#8217; alleged improper acts and money damages, which can be
tripled under federal antitrust law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timothy Dawson, chief financial officer of Jackson,
Mississippi-based Cal-Maine, said the allegations are similar to
those in lawsuits filed in Pennsylvania. He said the company
would defend against this one, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are aware of it,&#8221; Dawson said in a phone interview.
&#8220;This is just another one of those suits.&#8221; He declined to
comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Kraft Foods Global Inc. v. United Egg Producers
Inc., 11-cv-8808, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
Illinois (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameron Asks Court to Derail February BP Gulf Spill Trial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameron International Corp. (CAM) asked a federal appeals court
to derail a trial set for February to determine which companies
should be blamed for the 2010 BP Plc oil spill in the Gulf of
Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameron, which made the blow-out prevention equipment used
for the Macondo well, asked the U.S. Court of Appeals in New
Orleans to throw out the existing trial plan and rule that
claims against the company should be tried before a jury. U.S.
District Court Judge Carl Barbier, who is overseeing much of the
spill litigation, has scheduled a nonjury trial for Feb. 27 in
New Orleans to determine liability and apportion fault. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barbier plans two subsequent nonjury phases on the size of
the spill and efforts to contain it. Test jury trials on damages
to victims would follow, the judge has said. Cameron said that
trial plan violates its constitutional rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The proceeding envisioned by the district court&#8217;s plan is
not a &#8216;trial&#8217; as it is known in Anglo-American law,&#8221; Cameron, a
defendant in hundreds of lawsuits over the explosion and
subsequent oil spill, said in a court filing. &#8220;Its three phases
are reminiscent of the procedures followed by European courts in
which the judges are active prosecutors in search of justice
while the litigants are virtually bystanders.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court last week set oral arguments on Cameron&#8217;s
challenge for Dec. 22 in Dallas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The April 2010 Macondo well blowout and the explosion that
followed killed 11 workers and set off the worst offshore oil
spill in U.S. history. The accident and spill led to hundreds of
lawsuits against BP and its partners and contractors, including
Cameron; Transocean Ltd. (RIG), the Switzerland-based owner and
operator of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig that exploded;
and Halliburton Co. (HAL), which provided cementing services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals case is In re Cameron International, U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The lawsuits are combined in
In re Oil Spill by the Oil Rig Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of
Mexico on April 20, 2010, MDL-2179, U.S. District Court, Eastern
District of Louisiana (New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sandusky Waived Hearing After Last-Minute, Late-Night Talks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Sandusky&#8217;s lawyer and prosecutors negotiated late
into last night to set the stage for the abbreviated preliminary
hearing in the child sex-abuse case against the former
Pennsylvania State University assistant football coach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sandusky, 67, waived his right to the hearing at the start
of the 8:30 a.m. session yesterday in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania,
where some of his accusers were set to testify. He also waived
an arraignment, pleading not guilty to more than 40 criminal
counts related to the alleged molestation of 10 boys from 1994
to 2009. The decision was made at 10:30 p.m. yesterday after
talks with prosecutors by phone, his attorney, Joseph Amendola,
said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amendola said he got commitments from the prosecutors to
expedite evidence sharing and to maintain bail terms in exchange
for the waiver. The deal may backfire on the defense, a former
prosecutor said. By choosing not to question the 11 witnesses
set to testify yesterday, Amendola and his client are forgoing
valuable information they could use at trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In a preliminary hearing, you have the right to confront
your accusers, you have the right to cross-examine witnesses.
It&#8217;s a very helpful and powerful tool for a trial lawyer,&#8221; said
Jack McMahon, a former prosecutor in the Philadelphia District
Attorney&#8217;s office. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t make sense to give up that
important right.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sandusky was initially charged on Nov. 5 with crimes
involving eight boys. He was rearrested last week and charged
with more crimes after two new accusers came forward. The
charges include nine counts of involuntary deviate sexual
intercourse, each punishable by as much as 20 years in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said Sandusky used Second Mile, a children&#8217;s
charity he founded, to recruit victims, befriending them and
&#8220;grooming&#8221; them with gifts, trips to football games and money.
The alleged victims ranged in age from 10 to 15 when the abuse
occurred, according to court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Sandusky,
MJ-49201-cr-0000636-2011, Magisterial District Court, Centre
County. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTC Files Complaint in Taiwan Against Citigroup Employee &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTC Corp. (2498), the biggest seller of smartphones in the U.S.,
filed a complaint in Taiwan against a Citigroup Inc. employee
after the broker downgraded its recommendation on the company,
preceding a 59 percent drop in the handset maker&#8217;s shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;HTC submitted the case in August against a person at
Citigroup Global Markets&#8221; in relationship to alleged violations
of the Securities and Exchange Act, Huang Mou-hsin, deputy chief
prosecutor at the Taipei District Prosecutors Office, said by
phone yesterday. He declined to identify the person and said
investigations are continuing. Annie Lu, a spokeswoman for
Taoyuan, Taiwan-based HTC, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup, the best-performing broker covering HTC, on July
7 cut the stock to &#8220;sell&#8221; from &#8220;buy,&#8221; citing corporate
governance concerns over its purchase of S3 Graphics Co.,
competition from Samsung Electronics Co. and slowing demand. HTC
last month cut its sales forecast citing competition and
prompting at least six brokers to downgrade the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given the matter is being reviewed by the authorities, it
would be inappropriate for us to provide any comments,&#8221;
Citibank said in an e-mailed response to queries yesterday. HTC
hasn&#8217;t publicly named the Citigroup employee or cited what
information it has concerns over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTC filed a suit against an analyst at Citigroup, alleging
the person disseminated false information that affected the
handset maker&#8217;s share price, the Taipei-based Commercial Times
reported yesterday, without saying where it got the information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The handset maker&#8217;s close relationship with operators, and
customers delaying purchases of Apple Inc.&#8217;s latest iPhone,
helped HTC become the leading seller of smartphones in the U.S.
last quarter, according to researcher Strategy Analytics Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTC shares have dropped 59 percent since July 6, the day
before Citigroup Taipei-based analysts Kevin Chang and Jonathan
Gu published a report outlining their downgrade and cut their 12
month price target by 37 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They revised their recommendation to &#8220;hold&#8221; in September,
after the stock had dropped more than 30 percent, and then again
rated it &#8220;sell&#8221; on Nov. 23. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEC Accounting-Fraud Cases Drop to 10-Year Low: BGOV Barometer &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission brought the
fewest accounting-fraud cases in a least a decade in fiscal
2011, reflecting a shift in enforcement priorities in the wake
of the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BGOV Barometer shows the agency filed 109 actions
related to financial fraud and issuer disclosure in the year
ended Sept. 30, punctuating a four-year decline in such cases
from a recent high of 219 in fiscal 2007, according to SEC data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A focus on cases related to the financial crisis and on
Ponzi schemes following the Bernard Madoff swindle may have
drawn resources away from traditional priority areas such as
accounting fraud, said Joan McKown, a former SEC lawyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s always a trade-off,&#8221; said McKown, now a partner
with the law firm Jones Day in Washington. &#8220;If one area has
gone down, there might be a concern about whether there&#8217;s
something they&#8217;re missing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accounting fraud had constituted the biggest category of
enforcement actions for most of the last decade, SEC figures
show. McKown said a surge in such cases through 2007 followed
accounting scandals at Enron Corp. and Adelphia Communications
Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decline in accounting cases since then came after the
biggest reorganization of the SEC&#8217;s enforcement division in 30
years. Robert Khuzami, who became head of the enforcement branch
in 2009, realigned investigators&#8217; priorities, establishing five
specialized units to focus on market abuse, municipal
securities, foreign bribery, structured products and asset
managers such as hedge funds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novell Makes Closing Arguments at Microsoft Antitrust Trial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novell Inc. (NOVL) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) made closing arguments
yesterday in Novell&#8217;s case claiming the world&#8217;s largest software
maker unfairly used its monopoly on personal computer operating
systems to suppress WordPerfect, a rival word-processing
program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In defending the case in federal court in Salt Lake City,
Microsoft called Chairman Bill Gates as a witness last month.
Gates testified that he &#8220;absolutely&#8221; denied the central
allegation of Novell&#8217;s suit: that in 1994, in developing the
Windows 95 operating system, Microsoft blocked an element of the
software to thwart Novell&#8217;s WordPerfect and Quattro Pro
programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novell is seeking as much as $1.3 billion in damages, which
would be tripled under antitrust law. The company &#8220;wanted
nothing more than to compete on the merits of its products,&#8221;
the company&#8217;s lawyer, Jeffrey Johnson, told the jury. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decision to restrict outside programmers&#8217; access to
&#8220;extensions,&#8221; or programming code -- a decision that Novell
claims deliberately targeted WordPerfect and made it impossible
to run properly on Windows -- was made at a 1993 &#8220;high-level
executive retreat&#8221; at Hood Canal, Washington, Johnson told
jurors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gates&#8217;s testimony that the extensions were &#8220;trivial and
unimportant -- hardly worth his time&#8221; doesn&#8217;t withstand
scrutiny, Johnson said. Johnson revisited testimony and e-mails
presented at trial to argue the decision was a &#8220;purely
predatory action.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He wasn&#8217;t telling the truth,&#8221; Johnson said, referring to
Gates&#8217;s testimony. &#8220;It was important to him.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David B. Tulchin, a lawyer representing Microsoft, told
jurors that Novell &#8220;showed you not one document in which Novell
complained to Microsoft&#8221; about the blocked extensions in 1994
or 1995. A juror might conclude that a company facing $1 billion
of damages without the code at issue would &#8220;speak up,&#8221; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Novell Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 04-01045, U.S.
District Court, District of Utah (Salt Lake City). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Washington Mutual Officers Reach $64 Million FDIC Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three former executives of Washington Mutual, Inc. have
agreed to a $64 million settlement of a lawsuit brought by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. over the bank&#8217;s failure in
September 2008, according to FDIC officials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former chief executive Kerry Killinger, former chief
operating officer Stephen Rotella and the former top lending
official David Schneider had faced claims from the FDIC that
they pay $900 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDIC values the settlement at $64 million, according to
the officials, who briefed reporters on the condition of
anonymity yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WaMu failed after depositors withdrew money and a years-
long focus on subprime mortgages took its toll, and its holding
company has since been the subject of litigation by
shareholders, noteholders, officers and regulators. Its
deposits, assets and certain liabilities were immediately sold
to JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) after its regulator, the now-defunct
Office of Thrift Supervision, closed the Seattle-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement will be formalized in the next day and made
public within a week, the officials said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commerzbank&#8217;s Eurohypo Ordered to Pay on Profit Certificates &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commerzbank AG&#8217;s Eurohypo must pay interest to holders of
profit certificates, a German appeals court ruled in a case
brought by private-equity firm Crown Ocean Capital Ltd. (OCE) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Frankfurt Higher Regional Court yesterday overturned a
lower court ruling from last year that Eurohypo, Commerzbank&#8217;s
real estate arm, could stop payments for 2009 after recording a
loss. The certificates were originally issued by Rheinhyp AG,
which later became part of Eurohypo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QVT Financial LP, a New York hedge fund, won a ruling in
Frankfurt earlier this year over the issue in a separate suit.
QVT has also sued in Delaware, claiming Eurohypo owes $68
million for profit-dependant payments on hybrid capital
investments. Commerzbank is trying to raise 5.3 billion euros
($7 billion) in capital by mid-2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commerzbank, which agreed to buy Eurohypo in 2005, will
analyze the ruling and may appeal, company spokesman Maximilian Bicker said in an e-mailed statement. Eurohypo can appeal the
decision to Germany&#8217;s top civil court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The ruling for the first time clarifies an important
legal issue: how do you have to indemnify profit certificate
investors in a takeover,&#8221; said Klaus Steiner, Crown Ocean&#8217;s
lawyer. &#8220;The court reasoned that you have to grant them
protection similar to shareholders in that situation under
German law.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s case is OLG Frankfurt am Main, 5 U 56/11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard Bank Settles $150 Million Loan Fight With Saudi Sheikh &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia&#8217;s third-richest man and Standard Bank Group
Ltd. have settled their dispute over unpaid loans, according to
court documents filed in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard Bank&#8217;s U.K. unit sued Sheikh Mohamed bin Issa al
Jaber for the repayment of $150 million in loans to companies in
his MBI International  Partners Inc. group. Al Jaber said he
would countersue the Johannesburg-based bank over unauthorized
currency trades made from his account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;On Dec. 7, Standard Bank, Sheikh Mohamed and his
corporate entities reached a mutually agreeable settlement of
all claims between them,&#8221; al Jaber&#8217;s spokesman Neil McLeod said
in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice Garraway, a London based spokeswoman for Standard
Bank, confirmed the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Julian Flaux on Dec. 12 ordered the lawsuit be put on
hold because the parties had settled. He also lifted the global
freezing order against the Sheikh&#8217;s assets, which al Jaber has
said forced parts of his hotel business into administration and
cost him more than 1 billion pounds ($1.55 billion). The terms
of the settlement filed Dec. 12 with the court weren&#8217;t made
public. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Litigation Departments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White-Collar Defenders in Demand at Law Firms &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White-collar criminal-defense attorneys may be more sought-
after at U.S. law firms than at any other time in a decade
because of stepped-up enforcement of a federal anti-bribery
statute and the Dodd-Frank regulatory law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is &#8220;greater demand for white-collar and enforcement
partners than any time I can recall in my 20-plus years as a
recruiter, other than when Enron was dominating the headlines,&#8221;
said Jon Lindsey of Major, Lindsey  Africa, a legal recruiting
firm in New York. Enron Corp., once the largest energy trader,
declared bankruptcy in December 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heightened enforcement since 2007 of the federal Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act, which makes it a crime to bribe foreign
officials to get business, and a whistle-blower provision in
Dodd-Frank are driving the trend, Lindsey said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least nine of the 67 highest-grossing American firms
announced they hired partners for their white-collar defense or
regulatory compliance practices in the past 15 weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the biggest computer services provider, settled a
European Union antitrust probe into conduct that may have
hindered rival mainframe-software makers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission accepted IBM&#8217;s offer to supply
spare parts and technical information to other manufacturers on
reasonable and non-discriminatory terms for five years, the EU
said in an e-mailed statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I am pleased that we could find a swift solution with IBM
to our competition concerns,&#8221; said EU Competition Commissioner
Joaquin Almunia in the statement. &#8220;Timely interventions are
crucial in fast-moving technology markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While IBM has shifted its focus away from hardware toward
its more profitable software and services businesses, the
mainframe operations have high gross margins and help pull in
revenue for other IBM divisions. Armonk, New York-based IBM
began developing mainframe computers in the 1940s and 1950s and
is among the few companies selling the systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s offer ends a probe that started last year into what
the EU said were &#8220;unreasonable&#8221; supply conditions that may
have restricted or delayed rivals&#8217; access to spare parts. IBM
made the proposal in September. The Brussels-based regulator
also closed a separate probe over IBM&#8217;s mainframe computers
after three competitors dropped complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;IBM welcomes this final resolution of the inquiry into
certain IBM mainframe maintenance practices and is pleased that
the commission&#8217;s investigation of the IBM mainframe is now
concluded,&#8221; Joe Hanley, a spokesman for the company in London,
said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world&#8217;s largest computer-services company, won a
contract to build a food-monitoring system in China as the
nation toughens supervision of food safety after scandals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system for Shandong Commercial Group Co. will ensure
the safety of pork products in the coastal province, Harriet Ip,
a spokeswoman in Singapore for Armonk, New York-based IBM, said
in an e-mail today. Financial terms weren&#8217;t disclosed for the
project, scheduled for completion in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government in China, the world&#8217;s largest pork consumer,
said this month it will revise laws to improve food safety after
one person was sentenced to death and 77 others handed jail
terms over meat harmed by an illegal additive. China has
reported other food safety problems this year including toxic
fish, tainted bean sprouts and Sichuan peppercorns dyed with a
coloring agent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Food supply-chain management technology and services is a
big market,&#8221; IBM&#8217;s Ip said in the e-mail. &#8220;Demand for food
safety products in China is expected to increase 15 percent per
annum through 2013,&#8221; when the market will reach 13 billion yuan
($2 billion), she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM said its project is part of a 195 million yuan cold-
supply chain that Shandong province is building in line with
China&#8217;s efforts to improve food safety. The contract forms a
&#8220;very small portion&#8221; of the project, which will have full
monitoring and tracing capabilities, from farms to warehouses
and retailers, Ip said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;System Tested &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shandong Commercial has already tested IBM&#8217;s food-
monitoring system at 6 slaughter houses, 6 warehouses and about
100 hypermarkets or supermarkets across the province, Ip said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pork consumption in China may gain almost 10 percent from
last year to 57 million metric tons in 2015, Wang Yinji, deputy
general manager at COFCO Ltd., the country&#8217;s largest grain
trader, said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State-owned Shandong Commercial&#8217;s main business interest is
in retail, according to its website. The company also has
operations in the pharmacy and real estate industries and
employs more than 130,000 people, it said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steering clear of Citrix Systems
Inc. (CTXS), First Solar Inc. (FSLR), Franklin Resources Inc. (BEN) and Red Hat Inc. (RHT)
would help put U.S. stock investors on the right course for next
year, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pans from JPMorgan&#8217;s equity analysts, along with 65
other stocks they said were worth buying, were cited in a report
on the U.S. outlook for 2012. The calls were the analysts&#8217;
&#8220;best ideas,&#8221; according to the note, published two days ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, the performance of the four
stocks this year is a study in contrast. First Solar plummeted
67 percent through yesterday, putting the company in line for
the year&#8217;s biggest loss among shares in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s
500 Index. Franklin declined 14 percent, while Citrix dropped 3
percent and Red Hat gained 2.9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Solar and other equipment makers are likely to come
under pressure next year as governments reduce financial support
for alternative energy, JPMorgan&#8217;s Christopher Blansett wrote in
the report. &#8220;As the subsidies go, so does the solar sector,&#8221;
the San Francisco-based analyst wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citrix and Red Hat were selected by John DiFucci, a
software analyst based in New York. He wrote that Citrix may
suffer as many companies avoid desktop virtualization, which
lets employees operate personal computers remotely. Red Hat is
misunderstood by investors, he added, and pays relatively high
sales commissions on license renewals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Franklin was part of a &#8220;relative value&#8221; pairing with
Invesco Ltd., one of the 65 buys. Kenneth Worthington, another
New York-based analyst, wrote that investors may pull money out
of Franklin&#8217;s Templeton Global Bond mutual fund and other funds
that are trailing their peers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) came close to
beating out Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) for second place in the U.S. Internet
search market last month after the company&#8217;s Bing service made
gains on other sites, according to ComScore Inc. (SCOR) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software company, accounted
for 15 percent of U.S. Internet queries in November, up from
14.8 percent the previous month, ComScore said. Yahoo had 15.1
percent, down from 15.2 percent. Google&#8217;s share fell to 65.4
percent from 65.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking to compete better with Google, Microsoft has been
adding features to its search engine, including integration with
social-networking service Facebook Inc. to offer friends&#8217; input
on the best query results. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft
also provides technology to power Yahoo&#8217;s search service under a
10-year agreement between the companies, which are trying to
attract more marketers to buy advertising on query-results
pages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google (GOOG), based in Mountain View, California, may control 76
percent of the U.S. market for search-based ads this year,
according to EMarketer Inc. in New York. Sunnyvale, California-
based Yahoo may get 7.9 percent, and Microsoft may have 8
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google rose 0.2 percent to $619.54 at 4 p.m. New York time.
Microsoft fell 0.1 percent to $25.56 while Yahoo rose 0.9
percent to $15.16. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Brazilian prosecutor who filed a
lawsuit against Chevron Corp. (CVX) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG) said he&#8217;s
seeking a &#8220;permanent&#8221; ban on the companies&#8217; operations in the
South American nation after an oil spill last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no timeline yet for a possible ruling in the lawsuit
that has been assigned to a federal judge, Eduardo Santos, the
federal prosecutor in Campos, in Rio de Janeiro state, told
reporters today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santos, who is suing Chevron and Transocean for 20 billion
reais ($10.8 billion), said previous fines against other companies
in the millions of reais haven&#8217;t prevented such accidents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Brazil has to change the paradigm from millions to
billions,&#8221; Santos said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case imperils Brazil&#8217;s plan to boost crude output because
Transocean operates 10 out of the 61 rigs working in the country
and it would be hard to replace them in a tight market for oil
equipment, said Judson Bailey, an analyst at Jefferies  Co.
Brazilian oil production growth slowed after the country increased
safety requirements following last year&#8217;s spill at BP Plc&#8217;s
Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Tight&#8217; Market &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The rig market is pretty tight, so if Transocean were
banned, the oil companies wouldn&#8217;t be happy at all,&#8221; Bailey said
in a telephone interview from Houston. &#8220;Chevron and Petrobras (PETR4)
can&#8217;t get a rig elsewhere, so it messes with the state-owned oil
company,&#8221; he said, referring to Petroleo Brasileiro SA, known as
Petrobras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, and Transocean,
based in Vernier, Switzerland, said yesterday they haven&#8217;t been
notified of legal action and are cooperating with authorities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron is committed to remaining in Brazil for the long term
and is working with federal agencies, Ali Moshiri, vice president
for Africa and Latin American exploration and production, said at
an event in Houston, according to a report by Dow Jones Newswires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott Walker, a Chevron spokesman, didn&#8217;t return calls
seeking comment today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, Brazil&#8217;s third-largest producer behind Petrobras and
Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), will see production wane in the South
American country until the government lets it drill again, said
Cleveland Jones, an oil specialist and professor at Rio de Janeiro
State University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron fell less than 1 percent to $99.67 at the close in
New York. Transocean declined 1.9 percent to $39.41. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macondo Blowout &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron has come under increased scrutiny in Brazil after
3,000 barrels of oil leaked last month from an oil field in deep
waters of the Campos Basin. The company underestimated the amount
of pressure at an oil deposit it was exploring, and crude leaked
from the reservoir for about eight days, George Buck, the head of
Chevron for Brazil, said on Nov. 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP has booked more than $40 billion in losses related to the
April 2010 blowout of the Macondo well in the Gulf. The accident
killed 11 workers aboard Transocean&#8217;s Deepwater Horizon well and
spilled 4.9 million barrels of crude. That&#8217;s about $8,163 per
barrel spilled, compared with $3.57 million per barrel if the
Brazilian fine were to hold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ultimately this is an opening shot, Chevron&#8217;s attorneys are
probably not at all fazed by this,&#8221; said Jones. &#8220;The
prosecutor&#8217;s office will be a positive development for Chevron,
because they will ensure that the letter of the law is followed
and the letter of the law is reasonable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Criminal Lawsuit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron said yesterday that it &#8220;responded responsibly to the
incident at its Frade Field and has dealt transparently with all
Brazilian authorities.&#8221; Guy Cantwell, a Transocean spokesman,
said the company&#8217;s rigs are operating in Brazilian waters and the
company continues to cooperate with the government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron holds a 51.74 percent stake in Frade. Petrobras holds
a 30 percent stake, and Frade Japao Petroleo Ltda., a joint
venture including Inpex Corp. (1605) and Sojitz Corp (2768), holds 18.26 percent.
The Frade Field is about 230 miles (370 kilometers) northeast of
Rio de Janeiro and produced 76,000 barrels a day of oil and
natural gas in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next few weeks, prosecutors will probably file a
criminal lawsuit against Chevron for alleged environmental crime,
said Romulo Sampaio, a law professor at Brazil&#8217;s Getulio Vargas
Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In this case, everything conspires against the company:
it&#8217;s a foreign company, drilling for oil in Brazilian waters,&#8221;
Sampaio, who coordinates the university&#8217;s Environmental Law
program, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;That may bring about
emotional responses.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon Destruction &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors&#8217; track record in lawsuits against companies
involving environmental issues has been mixed. Federal prosecutors
twice this year sought to halt construction of the Belo Monte
hydroelectric dam in the Amazon, and on both occasions federal
judges ruled that the project should proceed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors in 2009 convinced Brazilian cattle
ranchers in Para, the state that has lost the most forestland to
illegal logging, to halt Amazon forest destruction to avoid an
international ban on meat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s five largest meatpackers -- JBS SA (JBSS3), the world&#8217;s
largest beef producer, Marfrig Alimentos SA (MRFG3), Bertin SA, Minerva SA
and Frigol Comercial Ltda. -- agreed to stop buying cattle from
suppliers that contributed to stripping the Amazon forest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawsuit against Alcoa Inc. (AA) is pending after six years.
Federal and state prosecutors sued Alcoa&#8217;s Brazilian mining
subsidiary in 2005 to block construction of the Juruti bauxite
mine, saying the company had circumvented the law by not applying
for a federal permit and instead seeking a license from the state
of Para. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mexico&#8217;s antitrust agency started an
investigation into agreements between phone carriers and TV
programming providers, a sign that Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO)&#8217;s bid to
enter the wireless industry is facing more scrutiny. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deals between fixed-line phone, wireless, Internet,
broadcast and pay-TV providers could represent prohibited
concentrations of market power, the antitrust agency said in
today&#8217;s edition of the nation&#8217;s official gazette. It didn&#8217;t name
any of the companies it would examine in the probe. An official
who can&#8217;t be identified under the agency&#8217;s policy declined to
provide specifics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa, the world&#8217;s largest Spanish-language broadcaster,
is awaiting antitrust approval for a $1.6 billion deal to
acquire 50 percent of Grupo Iusacell SA (CEL*), Mexico&#8217;s third-biggest
wireless carrier. Televisa aims to add wireless service to its
home-phone, cable-TV and Internet plans to compete against
billionaire Carlos Slim&#8217;s America Movil (AMXL) SAB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s something the regulators are taking a closer look at
than I would&#8217;ve originally expected,&#8221; said Christopher King, an
analyst at Stifel Nicolaus  Co. in Baltimore. &#8220;Clearly they&#8217;re
interested in examining what this could mean for the competition
in the future and whether significant conditions need to be
imposed.&#8221; He advises holding America Movil shares and doesn&#8217;t
have a rating on Televisa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iusacell is closely held by billionaire Ricardo Salinas,
who also controls TV Azteca SAB, Televisa&#8217;s closest competitor
in Mexico&#8217;s broadcast television market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials at Iusacell and Televisa who can&#8217;t be identified
under their companies&#8217; policies didn&#8217;t have immediate comments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa rose 0.7 percent to 56.77 pesos at the close in
Mexico City. Azteca gained 0.1 percent to 8.44 pesos, and
America Movil slid 0.2 percent to 15.46 pesos. All three
companies are based in Mexico City. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa SAB (KOF), Latin America&#8217;s
largest Coke bottler, sees as much as 2.7 billion pesos ($193.8
million) in cash flow from three acquisitions announced this
year, Chief Financial Officer Hector Trevino said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The sum of the three Mexican companies will represent
about 2.5 billion to 2.7 billion pesos in Ebitda in addition to
what Coca-Cola Femsa used to generate before these mergers,&#8221;
Trevino said in a telephone interview today from Queretaro,
Mexico. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization is a measure of cash flow known as Ebitda. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa bought the beverage division of Mexico&#8217;s
Grupo Fomento Queretano for 6.6 billion pesos ($474 million) and
will pay for the acquisition by issuing new shares, according to
a statement to regulators today. Earlier this week, Coca-Cola
Femsa said its shareholders approved an agreement to buy the
bottling operations of Mexico&#8217;s Grupo Cimsa with new shares, a
transaction announced in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, Coca-Cola Femsa agreed to pay 6.55 billion pesos
in stock for the Coke bottling operations of Grupo Tampico SA,
marking the company&#8217;s first all-share transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Queretano purchase should be completed by the first
quarter of next year, Trevino said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trevino said he&#8217;s open to seeking out additional mergers or
acquisitions in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America to foster
growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa reported a 7.1 percent increase in third-
quarter profit as sales volumes increased in Mexico, Colombia
and Argentina. Net income rose to 2.28 billion pesos as revenue
climbed 17 percent to 30.3 billion pesos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) sold $1.25
billion of 30-year bonds as yields on the longest-maturity
investment-grade company debt are at about record lows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. bank by assets issued 5.4 percent
debentures that yield 250 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
JPMorgan has raised $4.25 billion by selling 30-year notes, the
most among its peers since issuance of the securities by banks
resumed in October 2010 after a 15-month pause, Bloomberg data
show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the most creditworthy of the six biggest U.S.
lenders in the eyes of derivatives traders, is taking advantage
of yields on investment-grade bonds due in 15 years that average
5.19 percent, after falling from 6.16 percent in February,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. Banks
have sold $323.9 billion of debt in the U.S. this year, with 97
percent coming due within 10 years, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on the long-maturity debt reached a record low of
5.02 percent on Nov. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its last offering of 30-year bonds, New York-based
JPMorgan sold $1.75 billion of 5.6 percent debt that paid 140
basis points, or 1.4 percentage points, more than similar-
maturity Treasuries on July 14. The bank issued $1.25 billion of
5.5 percent, 30-year bonds at a 165 basis-point spread on Oct.
14, 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on JPMorgan, which investors use to
hedge against losses on the company&#8217;s debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, fell to 149 basis points yesterday from 182
basis points on Nov. 25, according to data provider CMA. That
means investors pay $149,000 a year to protect $10 million of
the bank&#8217;s debt for five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Swap Prices &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contracts on San Francisco-based Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) were at
150 while those for Bank of America Corp. (BAC) reached 407. Swaps on
Citigroup Inc. (C) were 276, contracts protecting the debt of
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) traded at 322 and those on Morgan
Stanley (MS) were at 426, according to CMA, which is owned by CME
Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt.
The contracts, which investors use to hedge against losses on
corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness, decline as
investor confidence improves and rise as it deteriorates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IPC index (MEXBOL) was little changed at 35,999.28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cemex SAB (CEMEXCPO)  advanced 1.7 percent to 6.56 pesos
as the largest cement maker in the Americas received $360
million in Petroleos de Venezuela SA bonds, the last portion of
$600 million it&#8217;s receiving from Venezuela&#8217;s government for the
nationalization of the company&#8217;s local unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa SAB (KOFL)  jumped 1.6 percent to 121.95
pesos as Latin America&#8217;s largest Coke bottler bought the
beverage division of Grupo Fomento Queretano for 6.6 billion
pesos ($475 million), according to a statement to regulators.
Grupo Fomento Queretano&#8217;s beverage unit operates two bottling
facilities and serves clients mainly in the state of Queretaro,
according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grupo Bimbo SAB (BIMBOA) , the world&#8217;s largest breadmaker
which gets more than half its revenue from U.S. sales, added 0.9
percent to 26.67 pesos as U.S. jobless claims fell to the lowest

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
and most profitable U.S. bank, named Michael Cleary to a new
position running the retail unit&#8217;s digital, online and mobile
strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Customers&#8217; use of Internet and mobile banking has
skyrocketed,&#8221; Todd Maclin, the chief executive officer of
JPMorgan&#8217;s retail unit, said in an internal memo to employees
today. &#8220;In fact, three quarters of our customers actively use
chase.com and active mobile households have more than doubled
since the first quarter of 2010.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cleary, who previously ran small-business lending, will
handle the retail bank&#8217;s Internet and mobile teams, according to
the memo. He will work with Paul Heller, head of the corporate
Internet group; Jack Stephenson, who runs mobile e-commerce; and
Guy Chiarello, who supervises technology across the company.
Maclin cited Cleary&#8217;s expansion of business banking in growth
markets such as California, Florida and Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott Geller, chief risk officer for New York-based
JPMorgan&#8217;s commercial bank, will replace Cleary in overseeing
lending to companies with less than $20 million in annual
revenue. A successor for Geller is being sought, Maclin wrote.
The retail bank lends money to businesses with less than $20
million in annual revenue while the commercial bank lends money
to middle-market companies with revenue of $20 million to about
$2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, has settled almost half of the lawsuits over its
menopause drugs and increased the funds set aside to resolve the
cases, the company said in a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and its Wyeth and Pharmacia  Upjohn units have
resolved about 46 percent of suits that claimed the companies&#8217;
hormone-replacement medicines, including Prempro and Premarin,
caused breast cancer, according to the Securities and Exchange
Commission filing. Pfizer said it added $68 million to the
$772 million it already reserved for the cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have recorded a charge of $260 million in the first
nine months of 2011 that provides for the minimum expected costs
to resolve all the remaining hormone-replacement actions,&#8221;
Pfizer officials said in the Nov. 10 filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 6 million women took Prempro and related
menopause drugs to treat symptoms including hot flashes and mood
swings before a 2002 study highlighted their links to cancer.
Wyeth&#8217;s sales of the medicines, which are still on the market,
exceeded $2 billion before the release of the Women&#8217;s Health
Initiative study sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Wyeth&#8217;s
Premarin, an estrogen-based drug, with progestin-laden Provera,
made by Pfizer&#8217;s Upjohn unit, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth
combined the two hormones in its Prempro pill. Pfizer, based in
New York, acquired Wyeth in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10,000 Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the height of the litigation, Pfizer faced more than
10,000 claims that its menopause drugs caused breast cancer,
according to lawyers for former users. Those lawsuits included
more than 8,000 cases consolidated in federal court in Arkansas
and suits in state courts in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Minnesota. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer in May disclosed the $772 million reserve and said
it had resolved a third of the cases, or about 3,300. The
November filing indicates Pfizer officials have now settled
almost 5,000 of the suits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pfizer continues to have a strong record of success in
defending these cases,&#8221; Chris Loder, a company spokesman, said
in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;While we will continue to look for
opportunities to enter into favorable settlements where
appropriate, we will also continue to vigorously defend these
medicines in litigation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jury Verdicts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyeth and Upjohn have now lost 10 of the 18 Prempro cases
decided by juries since 2006. Pfizer got some of those verdicts
thrown out or had the awards reduced. It resolved some of the
verdicts through settlements, while other decisions are on
appeal. Pfizer also has had cases thrown out before trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, a Philadelphia jury ordered the Pfizer
units to pay $72.6 million in compensatory damages to three
women who blamed the drugs for their breast cancers. Pfizer
agreed to settle the case before jurors were asked to decide
whether the company should face punitive damages. Terms of the
settlements weren&#8217;t released. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $260 million Pfizer has reserved for the remaining
Prempro cases is only &#8220;an estimate&#8221; and &#8220;additional charges
may be required,&#8221; the company said in the Nov. 10 filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoe Littlepage, a lawyer representing women suing Pfizer
over the menopause drugs, said that reserve doesn&#8217;t provide
enough compensation to spur settlements of outstanding claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Based upon the size of the jury verdicts to date, and the
fact that multiple appellate courts have now affirmed some of
those verdicts, this new amount of money set aside by Pfizer
seems grossly insufficient to resolve the remaining claims,&#8221;
Littlepage said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consolidated case in Arkansas is In Re Prempro
Products, 03-CV-015070-WRW, U.S. District Court, Eastern
District of Arkansas (Little Rock). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. oil producer, reported its 12th natural-gas discovery off
Australia since mid-2009 as the company advances with the A$29
billion ($29 billion) Wheatstone project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s Vos-1 well found 453 feet (138 meters) of gas in
the Carnarvon Basin off Western Australia, the San Ramon,
California-based company said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), Europe&#8217;s largest oil company, holds
50 percent of the permit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s A$43 billion Gorgon LNG development and
Wheatstone venture are among Australian projects aiming to tap
increasing Asian demand for the fuel as countries reduce their
reliance on coal to curb carbon emissions. Shell, Santos Ltd.,
ConocoPhillips and Inpex Corp. are among energy companies
planning about A$200 billion of LNG projects in Australia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron decided earlier this year to go forward with
Wheatstone, targeting first LNG shipments to Asia in 2016. The
U.S. energy producer has called Gorgon and Wheatstone the
&#8220;centerpieces&#8221; of its global expansion plans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Brazilian lawsuit that seeks to

&lt;p&gt;The case imperils Brazil&#8217;s plan to boost crude output
because Transocean operates 10 out of the 61 rigs working in the
country and it would be hard to replace them in a tight market
for oil equipment, said Judson Bailey, an analyst at Jefferies 
Co Inc. Brazilian oil production growth has slowed after the
country increased safety requirements following the spill at BP
Plc&#8217;s Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The rig market is pretty tight, so if Transocean were
banned, the oil companies wouldn&#8217;t be happy at all,&#8221; Bailey
said in a phone interview from Houston. &#8220;Chevron and Petrobras
can&#8217;t get a rig elsewhere, so it messes with the state-owned oil
company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, Brazil&#8217;s third-largest producer behind state-
controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc,
will see production wane in Brazil until the government lets it
drill again, said Cleveland Jones, an oil specialist and
professor at Rio de Janeiro State University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Opening Shot&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron fell 3 percent to $100.53 at the close in New York
yesterday. Transocean declined 3.9 percent to $40.19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron has come under increased scrutiny in Brazil after
3,000 barrels of oil leaked last month from an oil field in deep
waters of the Campos Basin. The company underestimated the
amount of pressure at an oil deposit it was exploring, and crude
leaked from the reservoir for about eight days, George Buck, the
head of Chevron for Brazil, said on Nov. 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP has booked more than $40 billion in losses related to the
April 2010 blowout of the Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico.
The accident killed 11 workers aboard Transocean&#8217;s Deepwater
Horizon well and spilled 4.9 million barrels of crude. That&#8217;s
about $8,163 per barrel spilled, compared to $3.57 million per
barrel if the Brazilian fine were to hold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still Operating &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ultimately this is an opening shot, Chevron&#8217;s attorneys
are probably not at all fazed by this,&#8221; said Jones. &#8220;The
prosecutor&#8217;s office will be a positive development for Chevron,
because they will ensure that the letter of the law is followed
and the letter of the law is reasonable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron said in an e-mailed statement that it &#8220;responded
responsibly to the incident at its Frade Field and has dealt
transparently with all Brazilian authorities.&#8221; Guy Cantwell, a
Transocean spokesman, said the company&#8217;s rigs are operating in
Brazilian waters and the company continues to cooperate with the
government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron holds a 51.74 percent stake in Frade. Petrobras
holds a 30 percent stake, and Frade Japao Petroleo Ltda., a
joint venture including Inpex Corp. and Sojitz Corp, holds 18.26
percent. Frade is about 230 miles (370 kilometers) northeast of
Rio de Janeiro in the Campos Basin and produced 76,000 barrels a
day of oil and natural gas in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Criminal Lawsuit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next few weeks, prosecutors will probably file a
criminal lawsuit against Chevron for alleged environmental crime,
said Romulo Sampaio, a law professor at Brazil&#8217;s Getulio Vargas
Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In this case, everything conspires against the company:
it&#8217;s a foreign company, drilling for oil in Brazilian waters.
That may bring about emotional responses,&#8221; Sampaio, who
coordinates the university&#8217;s Environmental Law program, said in
a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors&#8217; track record in lawsuits against companies
involving environmental issues has been at best mixed. Federal
prosecutors twice this year sought to halt construction of the
Belo Monte hydroelectric dam in the Amazon, and on both
occasions federal judges ruled that the project should proceed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors in 2009 convinced Brazilian cattle
ranchers in Para, the state that has lost the most forestland to
illegal logging, to halt Amazon forest destruction and replant
trees to avoid an international ban on meat after prosecutors
took action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s five largest meatpackers -- JBS SA, the world&#8217;s
largest beef producer, Marfrig Alimentos SA, Bertin SA, Minerva
SA and Frigol Comercial Ltda. -- agreed to stop buying cattle
from suppliers that contributed to stripping the Amazon forest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawsuit against Alcoa Inc. is still pending after six
years of legal haggling. Federal and state prosecutors sued
Alcoa&#8217;s Brazilian mining subsidiary in 2005 in an effort to
block construction of the Juruti bauxite mine in the state of
Para, saying the company had circumvented the law by not
applying for a federal permit and instead seeking a license from
the state of Para. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bondholder group said it may seek
reimbursements from JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) for soured home-loan
securities, after Bank of America Corp. agreed to pay $8.5
billion to resolve similar claims this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors holding $95 billion of mortgage bonds instructed
the trustees for the debt to investigate whether JPMorgan
included ineligible loans in the securities, according to a
statement released today by Gibbs  Bruns LLP, which says it
represents the group. The law firm helped secure the settlement
with Bank of America in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our clients continue to seek a comprehensive solution to
the problems of ineligible mortgages,&#8221; Kathy Patrick, a partner
at Gibbs  Bruns, said in the statement. &#8220;Today&#8217;s action is
another step toward achieving that goal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, based in New York, is a defendant in more than
10,000 legal proceedings, the company said in its third-quarter
report. Demands from private investors over mortgage bonds have
been &#8220;limited,&#8221; the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for JPMorgan, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bondholders asked Bank of New York Mellon Corp., U.S.
Bank NA, Wells Fargo  Co., Citigroup Inc. and HSBC Holdings Plc
to open investigations into the pools debt issued by affiliates
of JPMorgan, today&#8217;s statement said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America&#8217;s proposed $8.5 billion settlement would
resolve claims from investors in Countrywide Financial Corp.
mortgage bonds. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America
acquired Countrywide in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement has drawn criticism from insurer American
International Group Inc. (AIG) and other investors. New York Attorney
General Eric Schneiderman and Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden have also intervened in the case, which is pending in
federal court. The bondholder group has defended the settlement
saying in a court filing that rejection of the deal would be
&#8220;devastating&#8221; for investors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist
at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) in New York, said he doesn&#8217;t expect the
Federal Reserve to undertake new asset purchases next year
unless Europe&#8217;s situation deteriorates or inflation falls too
quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;So far, the European crisis has had a limited impact on
the U.S.,&#8221; he said in an interview today with Bloomberg
Television. &#8220;But you never know with Europe. We are as
concerned as anyone.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For Europe, I think we are just getting started in terms
of the slowdown,&#8221; Feroli said. &#8220;Whether we see more QE,&#8221; or
quantitative easing, &#8220;I&#8217;m not convinced. Right now, the growth
picture is not bad enough for the Fed to do more asset
purchases.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), deemed by
derivatives traders to be the most creditworthy of the six
biggest U.S. banks, locked in the lowest interest rate its
industry has seen since 2005 on 30-year debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. bank by assets sold $1.25 billion of 5.4
percent debentures yesterday to yield 250 basis points, or 2.5
percentage points, more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., the only other U.S.-based bank to have issued 30-year debt
in 2011, sold $2.5 billion of 6.25 percent bonds at a 170 basis-
point spread on Jan. 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is pushing out the maturities of its debt as
yields on investment-grade corporate bonds due in 15 years or
more approach the lowest on record while the Federal Reserve
holds down interest rates to stimulate the economy. The New
York-based bank has raised $4.25 billion by selling 30-year debt
since issuance of the securities by banks resumed in October
2010 after a 15-month pause, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPMorgan is one of the few in the market now that can
issue these bonds, and a big reason is investors think they&#8217;re
one of the best banks out there,&#8221; Rob Crimmins, a New York-
based money manager at RS Investment Management Co., which
oversees $30 billion. &#8220;In this environment, there aren&#8217;t many
banks that would be able to sell 30-year bonds.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a spokesman for JPMorgan, declined to
comment on the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowest Coupon &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan wasn&#8217;t among nine large banks including Bank of
America Corp. (BAC), Barclays Plc and Deutsche Bank AG downgraded
yesterday by Fitch Ratings, which found they are &#8220;particularly
sensitive to the increased challenges the financial markets
face,&#8221; according to a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debt sold yesterday has the lowest coupon among 30-year
U.S. bank bonds since San Francisco-based Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC)
issued $750 million of 5.375 percent debt at an 80 basis-point
spread in January 2005, Bloomberg data show. The securities
climbed 1.36 cents to 101.2 cents on the dollar to pay a 245
basis-point spread as of 10:53 a.m. in New York, according to
Trace, the bond price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its previous offering of 30-year bonds, JPMorgan sold
$1.75 billion of 5.6 percent debt that paid 140 basis points, or
1.4 percentage points, more than similar-maturity Treasuries on
July 14. The bank issued $1.25 billion of 5.5 percent, 30-year
bonds at a 165 basis-point spread on Oct. 14, 2010, the first
sale since Citigroup Inc. (C) issued $2.5 billion of the debt in
July 2009, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average Maturity &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s offerings extended the average maturity of its
outstanding bonds to 6.5 years at the end of the third quarter
from 5.66 years in the first quarter of 2010, Bloomberg data
show. The bank&#8217;s average coupon fell to 5.01 percent from 5.19
percent. It has sold the most 30-year debt among its peers since
October 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC Holdings Plc based in London and Utrecht, Netherlands-
based Rabobank Nederland NV also issued debentures of that
maturity this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks have sold $323.9 billion of debt in the U.S. this
year, with more than 97 percent coming due within 10 years,
Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to own U.S. bank bonds
instead of Treasuries has risen to 395 basis points from 210
basis points since the end of 2010, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data. Spreads touched 403 on Nov. 29, the
widest since July 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on investment-grade bonds due in 15 years or more
averaged 5.21 percent yesterday, after falling from 6.16 percent
in February, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index
data. They touched 5.02 percent, the lowest in daily data
extending to October 1986, on Nov. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Good Value&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spreads have widened on financial company bonds as concern
among investors mounted that Europe&#8217;s sovereign debt crisis
would spread, imperiling the global economy. That has made
JPMorgan and other U.S. banks more attractive to fixed-income
investors, said Anthony Valeri, a market strategist at LPL
Financial, which manages $330 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Financials in general and certainly the stronger ones are
good value in this market,&#8221; Valeri said in a telephone
interview from San Diego. &#8220;We don&#8217;t think the bank sector&#8217;s
going to implode. We think exposure to Europe is manageable for
U.S. banks, and therefore this risk premium is significantly
large right now to where it offers an opportunity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on JPMorgan, which investors use to
hedge against losses on the company&#8217;s debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, fell to 145.9 basis points yesterday from 182
basis points on Nov. 25, according to data provider CMA. That
means investors pay $145,900 a year to protect $10 million of
the bank&#8217;s debt for five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Bank Swaps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contracts on Wells Fargo were at 146.2 while those for Bank
of America reached 402.5. Swaps on Citigroup were 274.7,
contracts protecting the debt of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) traded
at 313.4 and those on Morgan Stanley (MS) were at 416.6, according to
CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted
by dealers in the privately negotiated market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt.
The contracts, which investors use to hedge against losses on
corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness, decline as
investor confidence improves and rise as it deteriorates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s Investors Service assigns JPMorgan a rating of Aa3,
its highest grade on any of the six biggest U.S. banks. Fitch
holds a rank of AA- on it and Wells Fargo. Standard  Poor&#8217;s
ranks Wells Fargo A+ and JPMorgan A. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Trust Management&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s ratio of tangible common equity to tangible
assets, a measure of its ability to absorb losses, is the lowest
among the six biggest U.S. banks at 5.49, Bloomberg data show.
Jim Leonard, a Chicago-based credit analyst at Morningstar Inc.,
cited the ratio when downgrading the lender to A from A+,
calling the level &#8220;a cause for some concern&#8221; in a note
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors buying JPMorgan&#8217;s bonds are looking past any
financial weaknesses and giving it credit for Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon&#8217;s performance in the wake of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.&#8217;s 2008 bankruptcy, when the firm avoided losses,
Leonard said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Their credit metrics are OK, but not stellar,&#8221; Leonard
said in a telephone interview. &#8220;What is stellar is their
reputation and their performance during the credit crisis. When
you think about the credit quality of banks, at some point you
have to trust management knows what it&#8217;s doing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, told a German court that Android-based
smartphones and tablets from Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. (MMI)
infringe its European patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft claimed in the first of three cases heard
yesterday that software Motorola Mobility uses protected
technology that helps computers switch between languages in the
same program. Presiding Judge Peter Guntz in Munich said the
patent may have been drafted so narrowly that its language may
not cover the solution Motorola Mobility uses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the first time the two U.S. companies faced each
other in a German court in the patent dispute. The country has
become a center for European smartphone and tablet lawsuits with
Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Samsung Electronics Co. are involved in similar
cases in Mannheim and Munich. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A suit between Microsoft and Motorola Mobility in the U.S.
is pending before the International Trade Commission in
Washington where a judge is scheduled to release his findings
tomorrow. Microsoft sued Motorola Mobility in Munich, while
Motorola Mobility, which is being acquired by Google Inc., filed
several suits against Microsoft in Mannheim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An offer by the court to mediate settlement talks was
rebuffed by both parties yesterday. While the companies have
talked, not much progress has been made since their last meeting
in October, Motorola Mobility attorney Marcus Grosch said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The German cases are just a fraction of all the
litigation. The bulk of suits is pending in the U.S.,&#8221; said
Peter Hess, a lawyer for Microsoft. &#8220;Motorola Mobility cannot
settle as long as Google hasn&#8217;t gained control, so talks here
don&#8217;t make much sense.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google said Aug. 15 it would buy Libertyville, Illinois-based Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion to obtain patents that
may be used to fend off suits targeting handsets and tablet
computers that use Android. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, makes its own
mobile-operating system, Windows Phone 7, which competes with
Android. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a second hearing yesterday, Microsoft argued that
Android-based devices illicitly use its technology for sending
short messages with an unlimited number of characters. Motorola
Mobility, which denies wrongdoing, argues Android&#8217;s uses a two-step procedure, whereas Microsoft&#8217;s patent protects a one-step
solution. The third case concerned technology used for intents
notifications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court scheduled separate hearings for each case in
March and April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s cases are: LG Muenchen, 7 O 7019333/11,
7019334/11 and 70020429/11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cephalon, Acusphere Claim Celgene&#8217;s Abraxane Infringes Patent &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA)&#8217;s Cephalon unit and
Acusphere Inc. (ACUS) sued Celgene Corp. (CELG) for patent infringement
related to the breast cancer drug Abraxane. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit claims Celgene&#8217;s Abraxane violates an Acusphere
patent for a drug formulation of paclitaxel particles, according
to the complaint filed Dec. 14 in federal court in Boston.
Abraxane&#8217;s active ingredient is the compound paclitaxel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The injected drug, used to treat metastatic breast cancer,
was obtained by Summit, New Jersey-based Celgene as part of its
purchase of Abraxis BioScience Inc. in 2010. The drug generated
$282 million in sales in the first nine months of this year,
according to the company&#8217;s quarterly reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cephalon, acquired in October by Petah Tikva, Israel-based
Teva, is the exclusive licensee of Watertown, Massachusetts-based Acusphere&#8217;s patent. The companies are seeking cash
compensation and an order to block further use of the invention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Cephalon Inc. v. Celgene Corp., 11cv12226, U.S.
District Court for the District of Massachusetts (Boston). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DuPont, Honeywell Said to Face EU Car-Refrigerant Probe &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DuPont Co. (DD), the largest U.S. chemicals company by market
value, and Honeywell International Inc. (HON) face a European Union
antitrust probe over a refrigerant for car air-conditioning
systems, according to four people familiar with the plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission will soon open a formal
investigation to examine whether DuPont and Honeywell may have
concealed their ownership of patents for the refrigerant before
the car industry agreed to use the technology as a standard,
said the people who couldn&#8217;t be identified because the issue
isn&#8217;t yet public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honeywell and DuPont are expecting growth from the
technology they jointly developed to meet EU environmental rules
to cut greenhouse gases from air-conditioning systems. DuPont
told investors this week that the low-emission refrigerant
promises &#8220;nice growth and some healthy margins.&#8221; Honeywell&#8217;s
specialty chemicals division has said it expects coolants to
help it make &#8220;extremely solid&#8221; profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said earlier
this month he planned to open &#8220;a high-profile case on
standards&#8221; to follow an investigation into standards in the
banking industry &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DuPont &#8220;will continue to cooperate fully with this inquiry
and is confident that the commission will conclude that actions
taken by DuPont complied with applicable laws,&#8221; said Janet
Smith, a spokeswoman for the Wilmington, Delaware-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honeywell is confident that its &#8220;practices are consistent
with the law and that the commission will conclude that we acted
in full compliance with European Union competition rules,&#8221;
Peter Dalpe, a spokesman for the Morristown, New Jersey-based
company said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refrigerant developed by Honeywell and DuPont was
designed to replace ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons, which
can&#8217;t be included in new cars sold in the 27-nation EU from
2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honeywell and DuPont agreed last year on a joint venture to
produce the refrigerant from the fourth quarter this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brussels-based antitrust authority can fine companies
as much as 10 percent of yearly sales or require them to change
the way they do business if it concludes that they harmed
competition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yahoo May Win Case Over U.K. Soccer Data, EU Court Aide Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) may win a bid to access annual schedules of the
English and Scottish soccer leagues, an adviser at the European
Union&#8217;s highest court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soccer leagues can&#8217;t claim copyright protection for match
schedules, Paolo Mengozzi of the EU Court of Justice said in a
non-binding opinion yesterday. The creation of soccer fixture
lists is a &#8220;data creation activity&#8221; and not an &#8220;original
intellectual creation.&#8221; The Luxembourg-based EU court follows
this advice in a majority of cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The effort expended in the creation of the data cannot be
taken into consideration for the purposes of assessing the
eligibility for protection of the database as such,&#8221; Mengozzi
said in his opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo, based in Sunnyvale, California, and a number of
betting companies who want to access the information, are at
loggerheads with the soccer leagues over whether their lists&#8217;

&lt;h2&gt;Red Bull Loses EU Court Ruling Over Dutch Trademark Breach &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red Bull GmbH, an Austrian energy-drink maker, lost a
challenge at the European Union&#8217;s highest court over an alleged
breach of its trademark by a Dutch company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A service consisting of the mere filling of cans bearing
a sign protected as a trademark is not use of that sign which is
liable to be prohibited,&#8221; the EU Court of Justice, the region&#8217;s
top court, said in a ruling in Luxembourg yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red Bull, based in Fuschl am See, Austria, sued Dutch
company Frisdranken Industrie Winters BV after it filled up cans
bearing logos and texts such as &#8220;Bullfigter,&#8221; and &#8220;Red Horn&#8221;
with drinks for another company, called Smart Drinks. Red Bull,
whose logo is a red bull, argued its Benelux trademark rights
had been infringed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frisdranken didn&#8217;t use the protected trademark and couldn&#8217;t
have infringed it, the court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The service provided by Winters consists of the filling
of cans and this service does not have any similarity with the
product for which Red Bull&#8217;s trademarks were registered,&#8221; said
the EU court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tina Deutner, a spokeswoman for Red Bull, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is pending at the Dutch Supreme Court, which last
year sought the EU court&#8217;s guidance whether a company that fills
up cans provided by another company, can breach trademark
rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is C-119/10, Frisdranken Industrie Winters BV v.
Red Bull GmbH. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ex-Judiciary Committee Staffers Lobbying House on SOPA &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixteen former staff members of the U.S. House of
Representatives Judiciary Committee are presently lobbying
Congress with reference to the Stop Online Piracy Act, the
Sunlight Foundation Reporting Group reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight ex-staffers of the committee are lobbying in support
of the bill, representing such organizations as the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce, the Motion Picture Association of America and the
Recording Industry Association of America, according to Sunlight
Foundation, a Washington-based non-profit group aimed at
governmental transparency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group also found eight different ex-staffers lobbying
against the bill, representing organizations that include Google
Inc. (GOOG), the Digital Media Association and Microsoft Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hollywood-Backed Bill on Web Piracy Debated as Amendments Added &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith urged U.S.
lawmakers to approve Hollywood-backed legislation aimed at
stopping Internet piracy of movies and goods that Google Inc.
opposes as promoting censorship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith&#8217;s panel was debating 60 proposed amendments to the
Stop Online Piracy Act yesterday before deciding whether to send
the measure to the full House for consideration. Lawmakers on
the panel raised concerns that a provision on blocking websites
may damage the security of the Internet&#8217;s domain-name system and
requested a delay to hear technical testimony. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lobbying by the entertainment and Internet industries
intensified ahead of yesterday&#8217;s hearing. Movie studios,
including Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc., want a crackdown on
non-U.S. websites that sell illegally copied films and TV shows.
Web companies say the House measure would harm innovation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Laws equip U.S. authorities and rights-holders to take
action against criminals who operate within our borders,&#8221;
Smith, a Republican from Texas, said in an opening statement at
the hearing. &#8220;But there is no parallel authority that permits
effective action against criminals who operate from abroad.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill would let the Justice Department ask courts to
order Internet-service providers, search engines, payment
services and advertising networks to block or cease business
with non-U.S. websites trafficking in stolen content or
counterfeit goods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixteen Internet executives, including Google co-founder
Sergey Brin, PayPal Inc. co-founder Elon Musk, and EBay Inc.
founder Pierre Omidyar, published an open letter to Congress in
major newspapers yesterday saying the House and Senate bills
would give the U.S. government power to censor the Web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, Facebook Inc. and other Internet companies rallied
around an alternative draft bill from Senator Ron Wyden, an
Oregon Democrat, and Representative Darrell Issa, a California
Republican, which would make the U.S. International Trade
Commission the arbiter of complaints about non-U.S. websites
linked to piracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal from Wyden and Issa &#8220;fails to provide an
effective way to target foreign rogue websites and goes easy on
online piracy and counterfeiting,&#8221; Michael O&#8217;Leary, senior
executive vice president for global policy and external affairs
at the Motion Picture Association of America, said in a
statement last week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Openwave Appoints Mendez, Robbins to Run IP Portfolio Business &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Openwave Systems Inc., a provider of Internet-based
communications software and applications, hired two new managers
of its IP patent portfolio business, the Redwood City,
California-based company said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the new hires is Daniel Mendez, who was previously
vice president and chief technology officer at American
Management Systems. He has also worked as director and senior
technical consultant at Cambridge Technology Partners, a
business consulting service based in Nyon, Switzerland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has an undergraduate degree in computer science from
Harvard University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim Robbins, the other new hire, was previously vice
president, general counsel and corporate secretary for Visto
Corp. Before that, he practiced law at Redwood City, California-based Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin  Hachigian,
LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robbins has an undergraduate degree in business and
economics from the University of California at Los Angeles and a
law degree from the University of Virginia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China may relax a loan-to-deposit
ratio for banks to spur lending and support growth, economists
from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Barclays Capital said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators are likely to relax &#8220;regulatory controls such
as the 75 percent loan-to-deposit ratio which will enable
commercial banks to have the ability to extend more loans,&#8221;
Song Yu, a Beijing-based economist at Goldman, wrote in a Dec.
14 note. Such a cap is &#8220;a more binding constraint on smaller
lenders who face more difficulty in attracting deposits,&#8221; Chang Jian, a Hong Kong-based economist for Barclays, said in an
interview by phone today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s leaders pledged this week to fine-tune economic
policies as needed next year as the government seeks &#8220;steady&#8221;
growth and the global economy falters. The central bank has
already cut banks&#8217; reserve requirements and encouraged lending
to smaller businesses as exports wane and the economy cools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first 10 days of December, deposits at the nation&#8217;s
four biggest banks fell by 400 billion yuan ($63 billion),
limiting their ability to lend, the 21st Century Business Herald
reported today, citing an unidentified person close to the
lenders. The newspaper said that capital outflows from China may
be a factor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report referred to Bank of China (3988) Ltd., Industrial 
Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank Corp.,
Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. Half of the decline in deposits
was at Bank of China, which does the most foreign-exchange
business and faces slower inflows of overseas currency as
expectations for gains in the yuan weaken, the newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;More Flexible&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Officials may be more flexible in implementing some
macro-prudential measures such as the loan-to-deposit ratio if
capital outflows continue and liquidity tightness worsens,&#8221;
Chang said. In the meantime, &#8220;another reserve ratio cut before
the year-end or the Chinese New Year is likely.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s November trade surplus shrank from a year earlier
and foreign direct investment fell for the first time in more
than two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outstanding yuan deposits at banks fell in October as
report from the central bank indicated capital outflows. While
deposits increased in November, the gain was the smallest in a
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total yuan lending by the big four accounted for about 61
percent of their total deposits at the end of October, based on
data from the central bank. By contrast, for lenders with total
assets of less than 2 trillion yuan the ratio stood at 83
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the loan-to-deposit ratio is not to be relaxed, loan
growth is unlikely to accelerate immediately, even with reserve
ratio cuts,&#8221; wrote Hong Hao, global equity strategist at China
International Capital Corp, in an e-mailed note today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission appealed a federal judge&#8217;s decision to reject its
proposed $285 million settlement with Citigroup Inc. (C) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeal, filed yesterday in the U.S. Court of Appeals in
New York, challenged U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff&#8217;s rejection
last month of the settlement, which involved claims that
Citigroup misled investors in a $1 billion financial product
linked to risky mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the district court committed legal error by
announcing a new and unprecedented standard that inadvertently
harms investors by depriving them of substantial, certain and
immediate benefits,&#8221; SEC Enforcement Director Robert Khuzami
said yesterday in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rakoff criticized the agency&#8217;s practice of resolving cases
without requiring the subject of the allegations to admit
wrongdoing. In his ruling, Rakoff said the settlement didn&#8217;t
provide him with &#8220;any proven or admitted facts&#8221; to inform his
judgment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khuzami said the judge&#8217;s decision &#8220;is at odds with decades
of court decisions that have upheld similar settlements.&#8221;.
Rakoff&#8217;s approach &#8220;could in practical terms press the SEC to
trial in many more instances, likely resulting in fewer cases
overall and less money being returned to investors,&#8221; he said in
the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC said a settlement such as the one struck with
Citigroup &#8220;puts money back in the pockets of harmed investors
without years of courtroom delay and without the twin risks of
losing at trial or winning but recovering less than the
settlement amount -- risks that always exist no matter how
strong the evidence.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a Citigroup spokeswoman, said the
New York-based bank disagrees with the court&#8217;s rejection of the
settlement. The agreement &#8220;fully complies with long-established
legal standards,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the case went to trial, she said, &#8220;we would present
substantial factual and legal defenses to the charges.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v.
Citigroup Global Markets Inc., 11-cv-07387, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Oil Spill Spurs Lawsuit to Freeze 17% of Brazil&#8217;s Rigs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brazilian prosecutor who filed a lawsuit against
Chevron Corp. (CVX) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG) said he&#8217;s seeking a
&#8220;permanent&#8221; ban on the companies&#8217; operations in the South
American nation after an oil spill last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit has been assigned to a federal judge and there
is no timeline yet for a possible ruling, Eduardo Santos, the
federal prosecutor in Campos, in Rio de Janeiro state, told
reporters yesterday. Santos, who is suing Chevron and Transocean
for 20 billion reais ($10.8 billion), said previous fines in the
millions of reais against other companies haven&#8217;t been enough in
preventing such accidents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Brazil has to change the paradigm from millions to
billions,&#8221; Santos said &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case imperils Brazil&#8217;s plan to boost crude output
because Transocean operates 10 of the 61 rigs working in the
country and it would be hard to replace them in a tight market
for oil equipment, said Judson Bailey, an analyst at Jefferies 
Co. Brazilian oil production growth has slowed after the country
increased safety requirements following the spill at BP Plc&#8217;s
Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The rig market is pretty tight, so if Transocean were
banned, the oil companies wouldn&#8217;t be happy at all,&#8221; Bailey
said in a phone interview from Houston. &#8220;Chevron and Petrobras (PETR4)
can&#8217;t get a rig elsewhere, so it messes with the state-owned oil
company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, and Transocean,
based in Vernier, Switzerland, said Dec. 14 that they haven&#8217;t
been notified and are cooperating with authorities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron has come under increased scrutiny in Brazil after
3,000 barrels of oil leaked last month from an oil field in deep
waters of the Campos Basin. The company underestimated the
amount of pressure at an oil deposit it was exploring, and crude
leaked from the reservoir for about eight days, George Buck, the
head of Chevron for Brazil, said on Nov. 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next few weeks, prosecutors will probably file a
criminal lawsuit against Chevron for alleged environmental
crime, said Romulo Sampaio, a law professor at Brazil&#8217;s Getulio Vargas Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allen Stanford Amnesia Claim &#8216;Not Credible,&#8217; Prosecutors Say &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R. Allen Stanford may be faking amnesia and should be tried
in January as scheduled on charges he led a $7 billion
investment fraud, prosecutors said, citing a prison medical
evaluation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford&#8217;s scores on medical and neuropsychological tests
&#8220;were sufficiently low as to evidence that he either was not
trying or was faking,&#8221; Assistant U.S. Attorney Gregg Costa
said, citing a doctor&#8217;s report. The prosecutor, in the proposed
court order filed yesterday, asked U.S. District Judge David
Hittner in Houston to find Stanford competent to stand trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A doctor who evaluated the defendant at a federal prison in
Butner, North Carolina, &#8220;concluded that Stanford&#8217;s performance
indicated that he was &#8216;blatantly simulating cognitive
defects/known to be malingering,&#8217;&#8221; Costa said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford, 61, has been imprisoned as a flight risk since
his June 2009 indictment on charges of defrauding investors
through a scheme built on allegedly bogus certificates of
deposit at Antigua-based Stanford International Bank Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hittner delayed the trial, which had been set for last
January, after three doctors testified that Stanford was
incapable of assisting in his defense. They said Stanford had
become addicted to anxiety drugs prescribed in prison and could
be suffering lingering effects of a head injury suffered in a
2009 inmate assault. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ali Fazel, Stanford&#8217;s lead criminal-defense attorney, urged
Hittner in a separate court filing to reject the Butner medical
evaluation and continue delaying Stanford&#8217;s trial. Fazel asked
the judge to rely on the testimony of experts Stanford&#8217;s defense
team plans to present at a competency hearing next week in
Houston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors claim Stanford skimmed more than $1 billion of
investor funds to finance a lavish lifestyle that included a
fleet of jets and yachts, several mansions and a private
Caribbean island, as well as financial support for women with
whom he has had children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Stanford, 09-cr-342, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Cuomo Aide Said to Be Among Possible Foreclosure Monitors &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former aide to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is among
candidates being considered to ensure that banks including
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) comply with any
settlement of a nationwide foreclosure probe, a person familiar
with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven M. Cohen, who was the governor&#8217;s secretary, is one
potential foreclosure monitor, according to the person, who
declined to be identified because the negotiations are secret.
That person said North Carolina Commissioner of Banks Joseph A.
Smith Jr. is also a candidate, as did a second person who asked
not to be identified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selection of a monitor is one of the final issues to be
worked out between the banks and state and federal officials,
said the people. Selection of the monitor is a key issue for the
regulators because success of the agreement will largely depend
on his or her work, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another candidate is Nicolas P. Retsinas, a former
assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All 50 states last year said they were investigating bank
foreclosure practices following disclosures that the companies
were using faulty documents in seizing homes. State and federal
officials leading the talks are seeking an agreement that
provides mortgage relief to homeowners and sets standards for
foreclosure practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monitor would ensure compliance with any agreement with
mortgage servicers, according to a settlement proposal offered
to the banks in March. In addition to JPMorgan and Bank of
America, Citigroup Inc., Ally Financial Inc. and Wells Fargo 
Co. (WFC) are participating in the negotiations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohen declined to comment on whether he was a candidate for
the monitor post. Smith declined to comment on any nomination to
monitor the foreclosure agreement. Retsinas didn&#8217;t return a call
seeking comment on the monitor position. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BP, TNK Billionaires Seek to Defeat Oil-Company Theft Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc and its billionaire partners in Russian oil venture
TNK-BP asked a New York judge to throw out claims against them
seeking more than $1 billion in damages over the alleged theft
of an oil company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit by Norex Petroleum Ltd. stems from more than a
decade of litigation in Russia and the U.S. over Yugraneft,
which owns an oil field in Western Siberia. Norex claims its
controlling stake in Yugraneft was stolen through corruption and
armed force and that BP and its partners profited off the scheme
at Norex&#8217;s expense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP and the other defendants in the lawsuit, including
billionaires Leonard Blavatnik and Victor Vekselberg, asked New
York State Supreme Court Justice Eileen Bransten in Manhattan
yesterday to dismiss the complaint. Norex has fought in Russian
and U.S. courts over Yugraneft and lost, they argue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Norex cannot use this court as an appellate court to
overturn prior litigation decisions and outcomes,&#8221; said Owen
Pell, an attorney at White  Case LLP who argued for dismissal.
&#8220;They litigated all these issues in Russia.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norex says that in 2001, militiamen wearing fatigues and
armed with AK-47 assault rifles, forcibly entered Yugraneft&#8217;s
corporate offices, telling employees that TNK had assumed
ownership of the company, according to the Norex complaint. The
men were acting at the direction of Blavatnik, Vekselberg and
Alfa Group, Norex said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The assertions in Norex&#8217;s lawsuit are not only untrue,
they are simply a tired rehash of the same preposterous claims
they have been recycling for the past 12 years in both U.S. and
Russian courts,&#8221; Mike Sitrick, a spokesman for Blavatnik, said
in an e-mailed statement. Previous lawsuits have been dismissed,
and &#8220;we are confident plaintiff&#8217;s latest attempt will suffer
the same fate,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives of TNK-BP (TNBP) and Alfa Group couldn&#8217;t be
reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Primary Global Executive Fleishman Seeks Home Detention &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Fleishman, the former Primary Global Research LLC
executive convicted of conspiracy as part of a U.S. crackdown on
insider trading of consultants and fund managers, asked for a
sentence of 12 months&#8217; home detention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fleishman, 42, of Santa Clara, California, is to be
sentenced Dec. 21 by U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff in
Manhattan. He asked for detention rather than prison in a court
filing Dec. 14 by his lawyer, Ethan A. Balogh &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Fleishman does not present as a rogue employee,
secretly stealing his employer&#8217;s property for personal gain at
the expense of his employer, but instead as a man who worked for
essentially what became a rogue enterprise in which a legitimate
business model was structured in a way that misappropriation of
third-party information was likely to occur,&#8221; Balogh said in
court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Company management &#8220;sought to shield itself from
liability&#8221; when employees or consultants passed confidential
information, the attorney wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fleishman was convicted in September of two conspiracy
charges for a scheme to obtain and pass confidential information
from technology company employees moonlighting as consultants
for Mountain View, California-based Primary Global, a so-called
expert-networking firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fleishman faces as long as 20 years in prison on the most
serious count, according to prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese Drywall Maker to Pay $800 Million to Settle Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knauf Plasterboard Tianjin Co., a Chinese drywall maker,
agreed to pay at least $800 million to settle homeowner claims
that faulty building materials contaminated their homes with
corrosive sulfur fumes, plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knauf agreed to resolve claims involving about 4,500
properties that contain the tainted drywall, lawyers for
property owners said yesterday in an e-mailed statement.
Homeowners said the faulty wallboard emits gases that corrode
copper coils and electrical and plumbing equipment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;KPT has agreed to provide thousands of families the
opportunity to recover losses caused by KPT drywall,&#8221; Russ
Herman, a New Orleans-based lawyer representing property owners,
said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accord was announced yesterday before U.S. District
Judge Eldon Fallon in New Orleans, who is overseeing about
12,000 suits filed over the contaminated drywall that have been
consolidated for pretrial evidence gathering. KPT is a
subsidiary of Iphofen, Germany-based Knauf International, owned
by Knauf Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $800 million figure &#8220;is wildly speculative and
premature given the settlement terms,&#8221; Greg Wallance, a KPT
lawyer, said yesterday at a press conference. &#8220;We are confident
the figure will be considerably lower.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement didn&#8217;t contain a minimum or maximum number on
the cost of repairing homes with the faulty drywall, Steven
Glickstein, another company lawyer, said in a telephone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of the settlement will range from $800 million
to $1 billion, depending on the number of homeowners who can
prove they had KPT drywall, Herman said yesterday at a press
conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KPT payments won&#8217;t reach that level, Wallance said. Many
plaintiffs don&#8217;t have KPT drywall in their homes and actual
costs for remediation &#8220;will be controlled through a competitive
bidding process,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Those who select a cash option
will receive a discounted settlement value.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consolidated case is In re Chinese-Manufactured Drywall
Products Liability Litigation, 2:09-md-02047, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Madoff&#8217;s Former Controller to Plead Guilty, U.S. Tells Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernard Madoff&#8217;s ex-controller, Enrica Cotellessa-Pitz, is
expected to plead guilty to criminal charges stemming from her
former boss&#8217;s Ponzi scheme, the U.S. said in a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cotellessa-Pitz, who hasn&#8217;t been charged yet, will admit to
falsifying documents to aid Madoff&#8217;s fraud and to deceiving U.S.
regulators, as part of a cooperation agreement with the
government, assistant U.S. attorneys Lisa Baroni and Julian
Moore told a federal judge in a letter yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cotellessa-Pitz will plead guilty to four counts of
conspiracy, falsifying books and records of a broker-dealer,
falsifying books and records of an investment adviser and making
false filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,
the prosecutors said. The charges carry as long as 50 years in
prison, according to the letter to U.S District Judge Laura
Taylor Swain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, who pleaded guilty to fraud charges, is serving 150
years in prison for the largest Ponzi scheme in U.S. history.
Investors lost about $20 billion in principal, the U.S. trustee
liquidating Madoff&#8217;s securities business has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Rody, a lawyer for Cotellessa-Pitz, didn&#8217;t respond to
voice-mail and e-mail messages seeking comment on the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. O&#8217;Hara, No. 10-CR-228, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The
bankruptcy claim is Picard v. Cotellessa-Pitz, 10-4213, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bayer&#8217;s $750 Million Modified-Rice Settlement Now Binding &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Bayer AG (BAYN) unit said a $750 million settlement with U.S.
rice farmers who sued after their crops became tainted by a
genetically modified strain is binding now that the requisite
number of growers has accepted the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First announced in July, the agreement ended scores of
cases filed against Bayer CropScience by growers in Arkansas,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A sufficient number of now-verified registrations for the
settlement program have been filed by growers to represent 85
percent of U.S. long-grain rice acreage, a threshold point
established for the agreements to become binding,&#8221; Bayer
CropScience said yesterday in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bayer CropScience and a Louisiana State University facility
in Crowley were testing a strain of the rice for resistance to
Bayer&#8217;s Liberty-brand herbicide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The genetically modified variety cross-bred with and
&#8220;contaminated&#8221; more than 30 percent of U.S. rice lands, Don
Downing, lawyer for the farmers, said at the first trial in
November 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. exports fell as the European Union, Japan, Russia and
other overseas buying ceased or was slowed for testing of U.S.-
grown long-grain rice, growers alleged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bayer CropScience denied the testing program was
negligently managed and claimed sale prices rebounded after the
initial drop. The unit of Leverkusen, Germany-based Bayer AG
said the trace amounts of the LibertyLink rice posed no threat
to people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Genetically Modified Rice Litigation, 06-
md-01811, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Missouri (St.
Louis). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Settled About Half of Prempro Cases, Adds to Reserve &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, has settled
almost half of the lawsuits over its menopause drugs and
increased the funds set aside to resolve the cases, the company
said in a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and its Wyeth and Pharmacia  Upjohn units have
resolved about 46 percent of suits that claimed the companies&#8217;
hormone-replacement medicines, including Prempro and Premarin,
caused breast cancer, according to the Securities and Exchange
Commission filing. Pfizer said it added $68 million to the $772
million it already reserved for the cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have recorded a charge of $260 million in the first
nine months of 2011 that provides for the minimum expected costs
to resolve all the remaining hormone-replacement actions,&#8221;
Pfizer officials said in the Nov. 10 filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 6 million women took Prempro and related
menopause drugs to treat symptoms including hot flashes and mood
swings before a 2002 study highlighted their links to cancer.
Wyeth&#8217;s sales of the medicines, which are still on the market,
exceeded $2 billion before the release of the Women&#8217;s Health
Initiative study sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pfizer continues to have a strong record of success in
defending these cases,&#8221; Chris Loder, a company spokesman, said
in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;While we will continue to look for
opportunities to enter into favorable settlements where
appropriate, we will also continue to vigorously defend these
medicines in litigation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoe Littlepage, a lawyer representing women suing Pfizer
over the menopause drugs, said that reserve doesn&#8217;t provide
enough compensation to spur settlements of outstanding claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Based upon the size of the jury verdicts to date, and the
fact that multiple appellate courts have now affirmed some of
those verdicts, this new amount of money set aside by Pfizer
seems grossly insufficient to resolve the remaining claims,&#8221;
Littlepage said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consolidated case in Arkansas is In Re Prempro
Products, 03-CV-015070-WRW, U.S. District Court, Eastern
District of Arkansas (Little Rock). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ArcelorMittal (MT), Anglo Win Case Overturning Sishen Right Award &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ArcelorMittal South Africa Ltd. (ACL) and Anglo American Plc (AAL) unit
Kumba Iron Ore won a bid to overturn the award of a right over
the country&#8217;s largest iron-ore mine to a company whose owners
include a business partner of President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s son. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The High Court set aside the award of a 21.4 percent permit
to the Sishen mine to Imperial Crown Trading 289 (Pty) Ltd.,
whose owners include Jagdish Parekh, a business partner of
Duduzane Zuma. The right was previously held by ArcelorMittal
South Africa, a unit of the world&#8217;s biggest steelmaker. Its
stock surged the most in 11 months in Johannesburg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sishen Iron Ore Co., owned by Kumba and Exxaro Resources
Ltd. (EXX), holds 100 percent of the right to the operation and the
21.4 percent portion was never available for conversion, Judge
Raymond Zondo said in the Pretoria court yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are delighted that the judgment has confirmed that
Sishen Iron Ore is the only holder of the mining rights over
Sishen and that no other person including Imperial holds or may
be granted competing rights,&#8221; Kumba said in an e-mailed
statement. &#8220;With regards to the interpretation of the Mineral
and Petroleum Resources Development Act, we need to await the
full judgment and the reasons for the court&#8217;s decision.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zondo&#8217;s full ruling will be available on Dec. 20, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ArcelorMittal South Africa is &#8220;pleased about the ruling,&#8221;
spokesman Themba Hlengani said in an interview. &#8220;It confirms
our long-held view Kumba applied for and was granted 100 percent
of the right in the first instance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vanderbijlpark-based steelmaker&#8217;s Sishen right lapsed
after it failed to apply for a license by April 30, 2009, to
satisfy a change in legislation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imperial will appeal the ruling &#8220;early in the new year,&#8221;
Ronnie Mendelow, the company&#8217;s lawyer, said in Pretoria. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of Mineral Resources, which opposed the
action, will await the full judgment on the ruling before
commenting and will take legal advice on how to proceed further,
it said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Greedy&#8217; Insider Trader Jailed for Using Hedge-Fund Tips &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A London management consultant was sentenced to two years
in prison after being convicted of making about 500,000 pounds
($774,000) using confidential tips from a hedge-fund trader. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jurors found Rupinder Sidhu guilty on 22 of 23 insider-
dealing charges yesterday, said Chris Hamilton, a spokesman for
the U.K. Financial Services Authority, which filed the case. A
separate charge of money laundering wasn&#8217;t considered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You are greedy,&#8221; Judge Michael Gledhill told Sidhu
yesterday. &#8220;Sheer greed is behind all these offenses.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sidhu, 40, used information from AKO Capital LLP trader
Anjam Ahmad about the hedge fund&#8217;s trading plans to spread bet
on companies including Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER), Swatch Group (UHR) AG
and Michael Page International Plc (MPI) between June and August 2009,
prosecutors said. He is the eighth person sentenced to prison
for insider trading in a case brought by the FSA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sidhu denied all the charges, claiming he didn&#8217;t know Ahmad
was passing on inside information. In a June 2010 trial, Ahmad
was given a suspended jail sentence of 10 months, 300 hours of
community service and fined 50,000 pounds after pleading guilty
to insider trading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sam Hurd&#8217;s arrest on a federal
charge of conspiracy to distribute cocaine will cause months of
public-relations headaches for the National Football League
without driving fans away from the most-watched sport in the
U.S., analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re not turning off the TV, they&#8217;re not shying away
from fantasy sports and they&#8217;re not giving up gambling on games
because of this,&#8221; David Carter, executive director of the
Sports Business Institute at the University of Southern
California&#8217;s Marshall School of Business, said in a telephone
interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hurd, a 26-year-old wide receiver for the Chicago Bears,
was charged in a criminal complaint filed yesterday in Dallas
with one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to
distribute 500 grams or more of a cocaine mixture. If convicted,
Hurd faces a minimum of five years and a maximum of 40 years in
federal prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NFL has more than $9 billion in annual revenue and the
charge against Hurd rivals other issues the league has faced,
such as dog fighting, shootings and performance-enhancing drug
use, Carter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is not going to go away,&#8221; Carter said. &#8220;It&#8217;s going
to be an ongoing issue because they&#8217;re going to have to wait for
the legal process to play out and something like this would
appear to be pretty high profile, coming from a big market and a
guy who&#8217;s been in the league for several years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ATT Inc. (T)&#8217;s failed $39 billion
acquisition of Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)&#8217;s T-Mobile USA Inc. extends
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s lead among takeover advisers, while
seven rivals including JPMorgan Chase  Co. lose market share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the only bank among the top four advisers
that wasn&#8217;t involved in the deal, now has 24 percent of the
market with $529.5 billion in takeovers, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. JPMorgan&#8217;s share fell to 19.6 percent,
followed by Morgan Stanley with 19.2 percent and Credit Suisse
Group AG (CSGN), with 15 percent, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collapse of the deal also pulls global takeover volume
down to about $2.19 trillion, little changed from all of 2010.
ATT&#8217;s advisers, JPMorgan (JPM), Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR) and Greenhill (GHL)
 Co., will lose about $65 million in fees, according to
estimates by New York-based researcher Freeman  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenhill plunged to 40th place in the mergers and
acquisitions rankings after ATT said today that it was
scrapping the deal. Previously, it had held 18th place for the
year, data show. The firm, founded by Robert Greenhill, has slid
57 percent in New York trading this year, the worst performance (S4FINL)
in the 79-company Standard and Poor&#8217;s Midcap Financials Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advisers on the Deutsche Telekom side may fare better, and
could still get a percentage of the deal&#8217;s reverse $3 billion
breakup fee, said Lam Nguyen, a director at Freeman. Deutsche
Telekom&#8217;s bankers included Morgan Stanley (MS), Credit Suisse,
Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and Citigroup Inc. (C) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, JPMorgan may have received as much as $80
million arranging a $20 billion bridge loan for ATT, Nguyen
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprint&#8217;s Adviser &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs had been an adviser to Sprint Nextel Corp. (S),
which had been in talks to buy T-Mobile USA before ATT agreed
to a takeover, people familiar with the matter said in March.
The New York-based bank held the top spot in global MA advisory
every year from 2001 to 2008, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T-Mobile is the biggest deal to be scrapped since BHP
Billiton Ltd.&#8217;s $40 billion takeover bid for Potash Corp. of
Saskatchewan Inc. was blocked by the Canadian government,
according to the data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs may further extend its lead over rivals if
regulators reject Express Scripts Inc.&#8217;s proposed purchase
of Medco Health Solutions Inc. The $29.1 billion acquisition,
which would result in the largest U.S. manager of pharmacy
benefits for employers, insurers and union health plans, is
under review by the Federal Trade Commission, and states have
opened inquiries into the sale out of concern that the combined
company will command too much market power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;St. Louis-based Express Scripts has plunged (ESRX) 18 percent
since July 20, the day before the deal was announced. Medco,
based in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, has dropped 2.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speculators reduced bets on
commodities to a 31-month low on mounting concern that global
economic growth is slowing as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and
Barclays Capital reiterated predictions that prices will gain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money managers cut combined net-long positions across 18
U.S. futures and options by 9.6 percent to 532,521 contracts in
the week ended Dec. 13, Commodity Futures Trading Commission
data show. That&#8217;s the lowest since April 28, 2009. Wagers on
gold dropped to an eight-week low and coffee holdings tumbled 60
percent, the most since August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funds are less bullish after Moody&#8217;s Investors Service said
it is reviewing Europe&#8217;s ratings and the International Monetary
Fund said the region&#8217;s fiscal crisis is &#8220;escalating.&#8221; Europe
accounts for 19 percent of global copper demand and consumes
about one in six barrels of the world&#8217;s oil. Manufacturing in
China, the biggest buyer of everything from nickel to soybeans,
may contract for a second month, a private survey showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For most people, the fetal position is quickly becoming
their portfolio position,&#8221; said John Stephenson, who helps
manage $2.6 billion of assets at First Asset Investment
Management Inc. in Toronto. &#8220;It could get a lot uglier.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI Index of 24 commodities dropped
4.5 percent last week, the most since mid-September, led by
industrial and precious metals. The gauge gained 0.3 percent to
settle at 619.5 in New York. The MSCI All-Country World Index
fell 3.4 percent last week as more than $1.7 trillion was wiped
off the value of global equities. The U.S. Dollar Index, a
measure against six trading partners, climbed 2.1 percent. The
yield on 10-year Treasuries dropped 21 basis points, or 0.2
percentage point, to 1.85 percent, according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid a Recession &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said in a report Dec. 1 that the world is
likely to avoid a recession and maintained its &#8220;overweight&#8221;
allocation to commodities, predicting a 15 percent return in the
next 12 months. That is still the bank&#8217;s view, Sophie Bullock, a
London-based spokeswoman for Goldman, said in an e-mail response
to questions on Dec. 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are cautiously positive on commodities, and that view
hasn&#8217;t changed,&#8221; said Sudakshina Unnikrishnan, an analyst at
Barclays Capital in London. A close balance between supply and
demand across raw materials &#8220;could drive a strong price rebound
in early 2012,&#8221; the bank said in a report this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear Market Outlook &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP GSCI gauge tumbled 19 percent since reaching a 32-
month high in April. Cooling expansion in emerging markets will
spur further declines for raw materials, according to Michael Aronstein, the investor who said in early May that commodities
were entering a multiyear bear market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People are just coming around to the understanding that
things in the developing world are in a fairly serious
retreat,&#8221; said Aronstein, the president of Marketfield Asset
Management in New York, who correctly predicted the 2008 slump
that drove the SP GSCI down 66 percent in seven months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese factory output may decline for a second month in
December as Europe&#8217;s debt crisis weighs on exports and home
sales slide, preliminary results from a Markit Economics survey
indicated on Dec. 15. In the euro area, manufacturing may
contract for a fifth consecutive month, a separate report from
London-based Markit Economics showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Options traders are paying the most since August 2010 to
protect against losses in Chinese stocks. The Asian nation&#8217;s
gross domestic product will grow by 8.5 percent in 2012, down
from 9.2 percent this year and 10.4 percent in 2010, according
to the median estimate of 15 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic Growth &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro dropped below $1.30 last week for the first time
since January on signs of rising funding stress in the region.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there is no easy solution
to the crisis after rejecting an increase in the upper limit of
funding for a permanent bailout program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The macro outlook remains poor heading into 2012 with
risks skewed to the downside,&#8221; Morgan Stanley commodity
analysts led by New York-based Hussein Allidina said in a report
Dec. 16. &#8220;We are in the early stages of a multiyear
deleveraging and de-globalization cycle.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A crunch in financing for commodity trading, spurred by
&#8220;aggressive, sustained European bank deleveraging,&#8221; may send
raw-material prices plunging next year, Deutsche Bank AG said in
a report Dec. 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodity Funds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors put $156 million into commodity funds in the week
ended Dec. 14, according to data from EPFR Global, which tracks
investment flows. Gold and precious metal net inflows were $738
million, while non-precious metal commodities had a net outflow
of $582 million, said Cameron Brandt, the director of research
at the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based research company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funds trimmed their net-long position in gold by 11 percent
to 135,117 contracts, the lowest since Oct. 18, the CFTC data
show. Holdings have dropped in three of the past four weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold futures in New York slumped 6.9 percent last week, the
most since Sept. 23, as a strengthening dollar curbed demand for
precious metals as a haven. Bullion is headed for its first
quarterly decline in more than three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traders are the least bullish on gold since July. Ten of 21
surveyed by Bloomberg expect the metal to gain this week, the
lowest proportion since July 29. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A measure of 11 U.S. farm goods showed speculators lowered
bullish bets in agricultural commodities by 15 percent to
219,989 contracts, the lowest since March 2009. Investors
boosted their bearish cocoa bets by 50 percent, and increased
their net-short position in wheat by 11 percent, CFTC data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have the perfect storm at several levels, with the
European situation and slowing in China,&#8221; said Shonda Warner,
the managing partner of Chess Ag Full Harvest Partners in
Clarksdale, Mississippi, which oversees about $50 million of
assets. &#8220;Emerging markets have been the engine of growth, and
when they&#8217;re slowing, it&#8217;s really going to freak people out.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. and European financial
markets aren&#8217;t equipped to handle a default by Greece or other
countries in the euro zone, said Jes Staley, chief executive
officer of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s investment-banking unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What&#8217;s going on with sovereign debt in Europe is very
troubling,&#8221; Staley said on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s Inside Track
With Erik Schatzker. He said it was notable when German
Chancellor Angela Merkel said it &#8220;was not a good thing&#8221; to ask
banks to voluntarily write down their Greek sovereign debt
earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Raising the notion that a European government or any
government would actually back away from its obligations is
something that the market really is not set up to deal with,&#8221;
Staley said. &#8220;Once you establish that a country in the euro
zone can walk away from its debt obligations where does it
stop?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staley said U.S. Treasury debt is still the safest bet for
investors, even after its creditworthiness was downgraded by
Standard  Poor&#8217;s in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Hopefully, one of the lessons out of the 2008 financial
crisis is nothing is risk free,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Triple-A securities
are not cash, we&#8217;ve learned that. Sovereign debt isn&#8217;t without
its risk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a relative basis, U.S Treasuries &#8220;will continue to be
the safest asset in the world and a downgrade in and of itself
doesn&#8217;t really change the equation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, is based in New
York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gulf Keystone Petroleum Ltd. (GKP) pared
gains after climbing to a record in London trading after it
denied a report that Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) is considering a 7
billion-pound ($11 billion) takeover offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gulf Keystone, active in Iraq&#8217;s Kurdistan region, surged as
much as 33 percent to 219.75 pence, the highest since the
company listed in 2004. The shares closed up 7.7 percent at
178.25 pence, giving the Bermuda-based company a market value of
1.5 billion pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Whilst there is clearly increasing interest in the region
in which Gulf Keystone operates, the board is not in discussions
with regard to a sale of the company,&#8221; Gulf Keystone said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Independent on Sunday reported yesterday that Exxon,
the world&#8217;s largest oil company, is weighing a bid that would
value Gulf Keystone at about eight pounds a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Exxon became the latest explorer to join the
hunt for oil and gas in Iraq&#8217;s semi-autonomous Kurdish region,
home to about 40 percent of Iraq&#8217;s estimated 115 billion barrels
of reserves. Gulf Keystone has announced the discovery of as
much as 10 billion barrels of oil in the Shaikan field in
northern Iraq. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Jeffers, an Exxon spokesman based in Irving, Texas,
didn&#8217;t immediately return a telephone message seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kurdistan has attracted interest from small- and mid-sized
foreign explorers since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003
opened the region for the first time in decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Iraqi central government in Baghdad said this month it
will uphold agreements with Exxon &#8220;for now&#8221; after the company
signed energy contracts the government considers illegal with
the Kurdish region. Kurdistan and Iraq have yet to determine how
oil revenues will be split. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. named Gerry Murray to run its North America leveraged-finance business,
which includes capital markets, restructuring and origination of
high-yield bonds and leveraged loans &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global investment-grade businesses for both loans and
bond originations will be led by Thomas Cassin and Huw Richards,
according to an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg News. Justin
Perras, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan, confirmed the
moves. Richards will relocate to New York from London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the largest and most profitable U.S. bank,
divided its capital markets business into two groups last month
and named Andy O&#8217;Brien and Jim Casey co-heads of global debt-
capital markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ray Doody will remain head of leveraged finance for Europe,
the Middle East and Africa, including high-yield bonds leveraged
loans and restructuring, and Melissa Smith will move to London
from New York to run EMEA investment-grade finance, according to
the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Murray has been with the bank for more than 17 years and
was part of the original high-yield team, according to Perras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan leads underwriters in high-yield and high-grade
debt this year and is the largest syndicated-loan underwriter,
with a 20.1 percent market share, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leveraged loans and high-yield bonds are those rated below
BBB- by Standard  Poor&#8217;s and less than Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s push into cloud
computing will help the company compete with Google Inc. (GOOG), Apple
Inc. (AAPL) and Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM) It also will hurt profit margins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s cloud software lets corporate customers pay a
subscription to do things like manage spreadsheets and corporate
websites with software stored and run on Microsoft&#8217;s servers.
The new services also help users view TV shows and edit photos
on the Web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While that may be great news for customers, the cost of
storing software in Microsoft&#8217;s own data centers, combined with
other expenses, means the company may miss profit estimates for
fiscal 2012, said Heather Bellini, an analyst at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. It also means the good old days of outsized margins
for the software giant may be a thing of the past, said Jason Maynard, an analyst at Wells Fargo (WFC) Securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nothing will ever be as high as the old model,&#8221; said
Maynard, who&#8217;s based in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit margins, which shrank to a 22-year low in 2011, are
set to fall further. Gross margins, or the percentage of sales
left after production costs, will narrow 1.6 points to 76
percent in fiscal 2012, the average estimate of analysts
compiled by Bloomberg. That&#8217;s after a 2.4-point drop in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge to Microsoft&#8217;s margins stems from decisions
Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer has made in recent years
to invest in new businesses, such as adding content for Xbox and
acquiring Skype Technologies SA for $8.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising Costs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pressure will persist beyond this year as more
customers switch to cloud computing, which involves hosting
software on Microsoft&#8217;s servers and delivered it over the
Internet. That shifts the cost of storing and operating those
programs to Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft traditionally sold packaged software that, once
developed, costs little to manufacture and distribute. In moving
more business to the cloud, the world&#8217;s largest software maker
must take on the costs of running data centers. These expenses
include powering, cooling, housing and maintaining servers that
run the programs for clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co.,
estimates that cloud-related costs will range from 15 percent to
25 percent of revenue. That&#8217;s about 10 percent more than selling
standard packaged software, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Bellini said analysts may not be taking
into account a large enough increase in cost of goods sold for
the fiscal year ending in June, which could cause Microsoft to
miss profit predictions. Even Bellini, who lowered her
projection for gross margins and trimmed 9 cents from her
overall profit estimate, said she may not have cut enough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft declined to comment for this story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth Challenges &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margin pressure is making some investors leery of Microsoft
stock, and may weigh on the shares in coming months, said Walter
Price, who manages the $3 billion Allianz RCM Technology Fund at
RCM Capital Management in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares, which gained 1.7 percent to $26 on Dec. 16,
have declined 6.8 percent this year before today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft was already facing a challenging year for profit
growth. The European debt crisis and a sluggish economic
recovery have prompted government and financial customers to
pare spending, while the PC industry is reeling from flooding in
Thailand that has slashed production of hard drives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies will boost spending on software and computers at
a slower rate next year than 2011, according to Gartner Inc.,
which said it may cut its forecast even further at the end of
the quarter. Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ), the largest computer maker,
last month said it&#8217;s started to see businesses curb spending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xbox Content Fees &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s product cycles also point to a year of slower
growth in its flagship Windows and Office software businesses,
according to Rick Sherlund, an analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc.
The two divisions will expand more slowly this year as customers
wait for an update to the Windows operating system, which
Sherlund expects in October. Microsoft is likely to follow that
with a touch-enabled version of Office productivity software, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, costs are rising across businesses.
Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox game consoles, which are selling well, are more
expensive to manufacture than software, and the company is
paying more licensing fees for content to run on the Xbox Live
service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The addition of Skype, increased demand for consulting
services in the server business, and costs of Microsoft&#8217;s search
partnership with Yahoo! Inc. are also adding to the jump in
expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Need for Scale &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Including the impact of Skype, operating expenses for the
year will be as much as $29.2 billion, up from a previous
forecast of $28.6 billion, Microsoft said in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reining in cloud computing costs will be key, and that will
depend on how efficient Microsoft can become at running its
massive data centers. The company will need to attract large
numbers of cloud customers to get the services running at scale.
And it will have to remain vigilant on data-center energy and
cooling costs, said Sanford C. Bernstein&#8217;s Moerdler. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They should be able to be pretty efficient and they
should be able to generate net more revenue so the margin will
go down, but earnings per share will go up,&#8221; he said. That&#8217;s in
line with Microsoft&#8217;s own forecasts since starting its move to
the cloud. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) won a ruling that
Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc.&#8217;s Android phones violate one of
its smartphone patents, while failing to convince a judge that
six others are being infringed as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility, which is being acquired by Google Inc. (GOOG),
violated a patent for generating meeting requests and group
scheduling, U.S. International Trade Commission Judge Theodore Essex said in a notice today. The finding is the second in two
days from the ITC that has determined that some features of
phones running Google&#8217;s Android operating system are using
licensed technology without permission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As Samsung, HTC, Acer and other companies have
recognized, respecting others&#8217; intellectual property through
licensing is the right path forward,&#8221; said David Howard, deputy
general counsel for Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling falls short of the broader claims originally
sought by Microsoft, which has said its inventions are being
widely used in Android phones. Motorola Mobility General Counsel
Scott Offer said the majority of the ruling is favorable to the
handset maker and may provide clarity on what Microsoft owns to
avoid potential infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re talking about removing that feature from the
product very quickly to avoid infringement, but I&#8217;m not sure how
easy that is,&#8221; said David Mixon, a patent lawyer at Bradley
Arant Boult Cummings LLP in Huntsville, Alabama, who&#8217;s followed
the case. &#8220;Being found to infringe is never a good thing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Settlement Is &#8216;Best&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Settlement is always the best way,&#8221; Mixon said. &#8220;At the
end of everything, this is still a business dispute and business
disputes are almost always settled with money.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent is among those that cover a Microsoft program
called ActiveSync, which is broadly licensed through the
industry, including to Apple (AAPL) Inc. and Google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge&#8217;s finding are subject to review by the six-member
commission, which can ban imports of products that infringe U.S.
patents. Google said it had no comment on the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Motorola Mobility ruling follows a loss yesterday for
HTC Corp. (2498), which was defending itself from claims that its
Android phones were using technology from Cupertino, California-
based Apple without permission. Taoyuan, Taiwan-based HTC said
yesterday it would be able to work around data-detection
technology that had been found to infringe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also has a case against Barnes  Noble Inc. (BKS),
whose Nook e-reader runs Android. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphone Experience &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker, has sought
to block U.S. sales of Motorola Mobility&#8217;s Android-based
devices, including Xoom tablets and the Atrix, Droid 2, Droid X,
Cliq XT, Devour, Backflip, Charm and Cliq smartphones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft had claimed the Motorola Mobility products
infringed seven patents that are &#8220;essential to the smartphone
user experience.&#8221; They include a patent issued in 1998 for a
system that lets people select file names without being limited
to 11 characters; one issued in 2005 for a technique to update a
contact database; and a patent issued in 2010 covering a way to
know the device&#8217;s signal or battery strength. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent found to be infringed was issued in 2002 for a
way to generate meeting requests among a group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft filed the Motorola Mobility complaint in 2010
after the Libertyville, Illinois-based handset maker refused to
pay royalties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xbox Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a court hearing in Munich last week over German patent-
infringement claims brought by Microsoft, a Motorola Mobility
lawyer, Marcus Grosch, said the companies haven&#8217;t made much
progress on a possible settlement since a meeting in October. A
Microsoft lawyer, Peter Hess, told the court that any settlement
would have to wait until Google completes its $12.5 billion
acquisition of Motorola Mobility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, based in Mountain View, California, has said one
reason for buying Motorola Mobility was to obtain patents that
could be used as a bulwark against a surge of lawsuits targeting
handsets and tablet computers that use Android. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility has its own patent claims against
Microsoft in the U.S. and in Europe. A case at the ITC targets
the Xbox video-gaming system. Judge Essex, who is overseeing
that case, is scheduled to release his findings on Jan. 23,
according to the ITC&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft continues to infringe Motorola Mobility&#8217;s
substantial patent portfolio,&#8221; the handset maker said in its
statement today. &#8220;Motorola Mobility remains confident in its
position and will continue to move forward with its
complaints.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnes  Noble &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trial in Microsoft&#8217;s case against Barnes  Noble is
scheduled before Essex in February and involves different
patents. New York-based Barnes  Noble, the largest U.S.
bookstore chain, has accused Microsoft of misusing its patents
to obtain royalties on Android devices, and has asked the U.S.
Justice Department to investigate whether Microsoft is trying to
drive up the cost of Android to push out competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s case against Motorola Mobility is In the Matter
of Certain Mobile Devices, Associated Software and Components
Thereof, 337-744, while Motorola Mobility&#8217;s case against
Microsoft is In the matter of Gaming and Entertainment Consoles,
337-752, both U.S. International Trade Commission (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) asset-
management business must face a lawsuit by a unit of Assured
Guaranty Ltd., New York state&#8217;s highest court ruled, upholding
an appeals court&#8217;s ruling allowing the suit to proceed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan Investment Management was sued in 2008 and
accused of mismanaging the investment portfolio of a special
purpose entity named Orkney Re II Plc whose obligations were
guaranteed by Assured Guaranty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals in Albany today upheld a ruling by an
appellate court in Manhattan that common-law causes of action
for breach of fiduciary duty and gross negligence brought by
Assured Guaranty were not preempted by state securities laws. A
lower court had dismissed the complaint at the request of the
defendants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The purpose of the Martin Act is not impaired by private
common-law actions that have a legal basis independent of the
statute because proceedings by the attorney general and private
actions further the same goal -- combating fraud and deception
in securities transactions,&#8221; Judge Victoria Graffeo wrote in
the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will continue to defend itself against the claims
in the suit, Doug Morris, a spokesman for the New York-based
bank, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe that we acted appropriately at all times with
respect to the management of the client&#8217;s accounts,&#8221; Morris
said. &#8220;This is a decision related to the adequacy of the
pleadings and not to the merits of the claims.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Assured Guaranty Ltd. (AGO) v J.P. Morgan Investment
Management Inc., 603755/2008, New York state Supreme Court
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ), the
second-biggest U.S. phone company, and Cablevision Systems Corp.
settled a lawsuit over ads that Cablevision claimed
misrepresented its Internet speeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cablevision, the fifth-largest U.S. cable-television

outdated information. The ads ran their course Dec. 17 and
Verizon will have new ads sometime in the future, company

the ads. The TV, radio, direct-mail and Internet spots running
in the New York area claimed that a &#8220;just released&#8221; Federal
Communications Commission study shows Bethpage, New York-based
Cablevision delivers at most 59 percent of its advertised speeds
during peak hours, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FCC report from August referred to tests performed in
March, and Cablevision said it has upgraded its system since
then. On Dec. 5, the FCC said in a blog post that Cablevision&#8217;s
results in the report were outdated and its performance had
improved, Cablevision said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon is Cablevision&#8217;s primary competitor for Internet
service in the New York metropolitan area, according to court
papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon said in court papers that Cablevision&#8217;s request was
unnecessary because it planned to stop saying that the FCC
report was &#8220;recent&#8221; and that Cablevision &#8220;currently&#8221;
delivers only 59 percent of advertised speeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC) v. Verizon
Communications Inc., 11-cv-5934, U.S. District Court, Eastern
District of New York (Central Islip). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook Lawsuit Against Ads Given Go-Ahead by U.S. Judge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc., the world&#8217;s most used social-networking
service, can be sued by people who claim showing advertisements
that their friends &#8220;like&#8221; violates a California law regarding
commercial endorsements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose rejected
Facebook&#8217;s bid to dismiss the lawsuit on Dec. 16, ruling the
plaintiffs may pursue claims that the company&#8217;s sponsored ads
violate state law and are fraudulent. Koh granted Facebook&#8217;s
request to dismiss a claim that it unjustly enriched itself with
the sponsored ads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook earns revenue primarily through the sale of
targeted advertising that appears on members&#8217; pages, including
so-called sponsored stories, which the Palo Alto, California-
based company started Jan. 25. A sponsored story is a paid ad
consisting of another friend&#8217;s name and profile picture and
claiming the person likes the advertiser. The plaintiffs claim
it&#8217;s an unauthorized use of their names and likenesses and that
they deserve compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;plaintiffs have articulated a coherent theory of how
they were economically injured by the misappropriation of their
names, photographs and likeness,&#8221; Koh wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are reviewing the decision and continue to believe
that the case is without merit,&#8221; Andrew Noyes, a Facebook
spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Fraley v. Facebook Inc., 11-cv-01726, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Funds Claim $700 Million in Losses From Lehman &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), fighting Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. (LEHMQ) over billions of dollars in claims and damages, is seeking
to recoup $700 million in losses suffered by fund affiliates on
investments in the defunct firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The affiliates, ranging from pension trusts to Highbridge
funds, lost the money on bonds and other investments with Lehman
entities, and have valid claims on the defunct firm, the bank
said in a Dec. 16 court filing. It asked a judge to overrule
Lehman&#8217;s objection to the claims and allow the funds to recoup
the losses by using some of the $8.6 billion in collateral that
Lehman deposited with the bank before it failed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman says the funds aren&#8217;t affiliates, &#8220;merely
investment vehicles&#8221; for JPMorgan clients who bore the losses,
and can&#8217;t use the collateral to repay themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, New York-based JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank,
is fighting a lawsuit by Lehman that alleges the lender helped
cause its 2008 collapse by demanding the $8.6 billion in
collateral. The bank also is defending $6 billion in claims that
Lehman objects to and arguing it acted properly in seeking
security for loans made during the credit crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimberly Macleod, a Lehman spokeswoman, declined to comment
on JPMorgan&#8217;s filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history in
2008, listing $613 billion in debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan sued Lehman back after the $8.6 billion suit,
alleging Lehman defrauded its lender into making the loan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
08-13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). The lawsuit is Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 10-03266, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formosa Plastics&#8217; Wang&#8217;s Estate Disputed in Hong Kong Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winston Wong, son of Formosa Plastics Group&#8217;s late founder
Wang Yung-ching, sued in Hong Kong to recover more than $4
billion in assets for the estate of his father, once Taiwan&#8217;s
richest man. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defendants named in the suit include three of Wang&#8217;s half-
sisters -- Susan, Sandy and Diana Wang -- as well as former
employees of Formosa Plastics -- Hung Wen Hsiung and Jao Chien
Fang, &#8220;who were entrusted to manage YC Wang&#8217;s personal
finances,&#8221; according to a press statement issued by Wong
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit alleges that the defendants used a Hong Kong-
registered company called Hua Yang Investment (H.K.) Ltd. to
&#8220;wrongly siphon off&#8221; assets, including an interest in a coal
power plant and a hotel in mainland China, from Wang&#8217;s estate.
Wang&#8217;s Taiwan assets were valued at $1.7 billion, Wong said in
the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An independent global investigation has identified total
assets worth more than $17 billion, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two calls to the office of Susan Wang, Formosa Plastics
Group executive board vice chairman, weren&#8217;t answered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang died in the U.S. in 2008 at the age of 91. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Dr. Wong, Wen-Young also known as Winston Wong
and Wang Ruey Hwa Susan, HCA2154/2011, Court of First Instance,
Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprint Sues Time Warner, Comcast Over Digital Phone Technology &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprint Nextel Corp. (S), the third-largest U.S. wireless
operator, accused Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC), Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) and two
other cable-TV companies of infringing patents related to
transmitting phone calls over digital lines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprint filed separate lawsuits yesterday in federal court
in Kansas City, Kansas, against Time Warner Cable, Comcast,
Cable One Inc. and Cox Communications Inc. Overland Park,
Kansas-based Sprint claims the companies are using technology it
patented in the 1990s for transmission of voice data packets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies &#8220;have realized the great value in this
technology and have misappropriated it without Sprint&#8217;s
permission,&#8221; Sprint said in each complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 12 patents include some that were asserted against
Vonage Holdings Corp. (VG), which agreed to pay $80 million to
license the technology after losing a 2007 trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex Dudley, a spokesman for New York-based Time Warner
Cable, said the company doesn&#8217;t comment on pending litigation.
John Demming, a spokesman for Philadelphia-based Comcast, also
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rima Calderon, a spokeswoman for Cable One parent
Washington Post Co. (WPO), said the Washington-based company doesn&#8217;t
comment on litigation. Todd Smith, a spokesman for Atlanta-based
Cox, declined to comment, citing the pending lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Sprint Communications Co. v. Time Warner
Cable Inc., 11cv2686; Sprint v. Cable One Inc., 11cv2685; Sprint
v. Comcast Cable Communications LLC, 11cv2684; and Sprint v. Cox
Communications Inc., 11cv2683, all U.S. District Court, District
of Kansas (Kansas City). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Sued by British Telecom Over Mobile-System Patents &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;British Telecommunications Plc sued Google Inc., owner of
the world&#8217;s most popular Internet search engine, for allegedly
infringing six U.S. patents for mobile-device technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BT, based in London, is seeking a jury trial and
unspecified damages against Mountain View, California-based
Google, according to a complaint filed Dec. 15 in federal court
in Wilmington, Delaware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;BT has invested heavily over the last 20 years,&#8221;
generating &#8220;numerous patents,&#8221; and Google&#8217;s products including
the Android operating system, maps, search, music and book
services wrongly &#8220;incorporate BT&#8217;s patented technologies,&#8221;
according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, BT sued U.S. cable company Cox Communications
Inc. in the same court over four patents for transmitting data
over cable networks. A trial in that case is tentatively
scheduled for 2014, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe these claims are groundless,&#8221; Jim Prosser, a
Google spokesman, said in an e-mailed message. He said the
company would defend against them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is British Telecommunications Plc v. Google Inc. (GOOG),
11-CV-1249, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware
(Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global Judge Considering Nine Lawsuits Against Corzine &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Corzine, MF Global Holdings Ltd.&#8217;s former chief
executive officer, is the defendant in nine lawsuits before a
federal judge in Manhattan that are seeking compensation for
losses from the company&#8217;s collapse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs, including an electricians&#8217; union, allege
that Corzine and other company officials made misleading
statements about MF Global&#8217;s financial condition before its Oct.
31 collapse. U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero has been
combining the cases into one, saying they make similar claims
about similar facts and events, and he now has consolidated nine
of them, according to a court filing yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Levander, a lawyer for Corzine, didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the suits, which are
seeking class-action, or group, status. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corzine, the former governor of New Jersey, and senior MF
Global officers touted the company&#8217;s internal financial controls
and liquidity levels in statements that were &#8220;materially
misleading or untrue,&#8221; according to a Nov. 3 complaint filed in
Manhattan federal court by Joseph DeAngelis on behalf of himself
and other MF Global shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeAngelis also named Henri Steenkamp, the New York-based
company&#8217;s chief financial officer, and Bradley Abelow, its
president. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corzine and MF Global also have been sued by former
employees and commodity customers. A trustee liquidating the MF
Global Inc. brokerage is looking for $1.2 billion or more in
money missing from commodity customers&#8217; accounts. Corzine has
said he doesn&#8217;t know where the missing money is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main case is DeAngelis v. Corzine, 11-cv-7866, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials and Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health-Care Hearing at U.S. High Court Set for March 26-28 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court said it will hear arguments on
President Barack Obama&#8217;s health-care law over three days, from
March 26 to March 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Releasing a schedule yesterday that has few, if any,
precedents in modern court history, the justices left room to
expand the 5 1/2 hours they already allotted for argument. The
high court generally hears arguments for a single hour in each
case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first day will center on the Anti-Injunction Act, a law
that one federal appeals court concluded prevents judges from
ruling until 2015 on the requirement -- also known as the
individual mandate -- that Americans either buy insurance or pay
a penalty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices will use the second day of the hearings to
consider the central issue: the constitutionality of the
individual mandate. A group of 26 states, led by Florida, is
among those challenging the provision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On day three, the court will hear arguments on whether
other parts of the law should be invalidated along with the
individual mandate. The justices also will consider the states&#8217;
challenge to a provision expanding the Medicaid program for the
poor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are National Federation of Independent Business
v. Sebelius, 11-393; Department of Health and Human Services v.
Florida, 11-398; and Florida v. Department of Health and Human
Services, 11-400, U.S. Supreme Court (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occupy London Wins UBS Court Appeal, Fights St. Paul&#8217;s Eviction &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occupy London protesters who took over a vacant UBS AG (UBSN)
office building in London&#8217;s financial district won court
permission to appeal their eviction after a judge ruled they
weren&#8217;t given proper notice of a trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s notice to the protesters, in the form of a
document posted on the building and a text message sent to a
leader 45 minutes before a 10 p.m. hearing, was insufficient to
give the group time to prepare or determine how to participate
in the case, Court of Appeal Judge Timothy Lloyd ruled
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was &#8220;really no effective notice of the hearing at
all -- especially in circumstances like this, where a hearing
took place late at night,&#8221; Lloyd said. &#8220;There is at least a
compelling reason why permission to appeal should be granted.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court victory against Zurich-based UBS comes as the
protesters, who seek global economic-equality and claim the bank
behaves unethically, are in a separate trial to avoid being
evicted from their primary encampment outside St. Paul&#8217;s
Cathedral. More than 200 tents have clustered around the
building since the middle of October, inspired by the Occupy
Wall Street protest that has since been broken up by police. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This ruling is a vindication of the right of everyone in
this country to due process,&#8221; Naomi Colvin, a spokeswoman for
Occupy London, said after the ruling. &#8220;These people labor under
the misconception that they can throw money at a problem; it&#8217;s
emblematic of what the Occupy movement is trying to combat.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS&#8217;s press office in London didn&#8217;t immediately respond to
a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Court Rejects Tool for U.S. Companies Battling Chinese Imports &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies from steel to paper makers may lose a tool
they&#8217;ve used to fight undervalued Chinese imports after a U.S.
appeals court rejected the imposition of duties to offset some
foreign government subsidies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. law doesn&#8217;t let the Commerce Department levy duties on
goods from nations, such as China, that lack a market to set
prices, a U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington said yesterday in
a unanimous ruling. Congressional action is needed to give the
agency that power, the judges ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision rejected arguments by Titan International
Inc. (TWI), the top U.S. maker of off-road tires, Bridgestone Americas
Inc., a unit of Tokyo-based Bridgestone Corp., and the AFL-CIO
labor federation. It may take years for the companies to appeal
or press for legislation, said George Thompson, a lawyer at
Neville Peterson LLP in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. uses more than 300 anti-dumping and countervailing
duty orders to shield American-made goods, from honey to bedroom
furniture, against global competition it deems unfair and
damaging to U.S. companies. About half the orders target iron
and steel products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three-judge panel upheld a U.S. Court of International
Trade decision that found the Commerce Department action on
Chinese tires was illegal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Miller, a spokesman for the Justice Department,
which presented the U.S. case, declined to comment on the
ruling. A phone message for Joe Dorn, an attorney with King 
Spalding LLP representing Bridgestone Americas, wasn&#8217;t returned.
A spokeswoman for Representative Kevin Brady, who heads the
House Ways and Means Committee&#8217;s trade panel, said the Texas
Republican is reviewing the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is GPX International Tire Corp. v. U.S.,
2011-1107, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
(Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts, Settlements and Pleas &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Wins Patent Case with U.S. Ruling Banning Some HTC Phones &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL) won a patent-infringement ruling that bans some
HTC Corp. (2498) smartphones from the U.S. starting next year,
bolstering efforts to prove that devices running Google Inc.&#8217;s
Android operating system copy the iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. International Trade Commission, in a review of a
judge&#8217;s findings in July, said yesterday that HTC is violating
one Apple patent related to data-detection technology and issued
a limited import exclusion order that takes effect April 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;HTC will completely remove it from all of our phones
soon,&#8221; Grace Lei, general counsel for Taoyuan, Taiwan-based
HTC, said in an e-mail. The six-member commission determined
that three other patents in the case weren&#8217;t infringed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While less than what Apple sought, the ruling gives the
company its first victory in patent cases designed to slow the
growth of Android, which former Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs claimed &#8220;ripped off the iPhone.&#8221; Apple has one other case
against HTC, as well as complaints against Samsung Electronics
Co. and Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc., and is involved in more
than a dozen other cases before the trade commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The battle between Apple and Android is going to
continue,&#8221; said Peter Toren, a patent lawyer with Shulman
Rogers in Potomac, Maryland, who has been watching the cases.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure this decision, the way it is, is enough to push
the parties to settlement. Apple doesn&#8217;t have the leverage of a
total exclusionary order.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of affected products and a full reason for the
commission&#8217;s decision, which is subject to appeal and a
presidential review, wasn&#8217;t immediately made public. Apple&#8217;s
original complaint named HTC&#8217;s Nexus One, Touch Pro, Diamond,
Tilt II, Dream, myTouch, Hero and Droid Eris. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristin Huguet, a spokeswoman for Cupertino, California-
based Apple, declined to discuss the possibility of a
settlement. She repeated the company&#8217;s position that
&#8220;competition is healthy, but competitors should create their
own original technology.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives from Google had no immediate comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling is the first definitive decision in the dozens
of patent cases that began to proliferate in 2010 as smartphone
makers battle over a market that Strategy Analytics Inc. said
increased 44 percent last quarter from a year earlier to 117
million phones worldwide. HTC, the second-largest maker of
Android phones, used its partnership with Google to help
transform itself from a contract manufacturer founded in 1997 to
the biggest U.S. smartphone seller in the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In the Matter of Certain Personal Data and
Mobile Communications Devices and Related Software, 337-710,
U.S. International Trade Commission (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Deutsche Bank CEO Pays $456,000 to End Trial Over Kirch &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Deutsche Bank AG Chief Executive Officer Rolf Breuer
agreed to pay 350,000 euros ($456,000) to settle an attempted
fraud case over testimony he gave in 2003 in a suit brought by
Leo Kirch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Munich Regional Court ended the criminal trial
yesterday after lawyers for both sides told the judges they had
reached a deal. The presiding judge in the case, Anton Winkler,
called for a settlement last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We were permanently rotating between &#8216;maybe he did know
more&#8217; and a potential acquittal, so it&#8217;s reasonable to end the
case now,&#8221; Winkler said when announcing the ruling. &#8220;Even if
we would have found guilt in this case, it would have been at
the very lowest level required for a conviction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirch, who died in July, was once one of Germany&#8217;s biggest
media tycoons and pursued civil lawsuits against Breuer, 74, and
Deutsche Bank seeking at least 3.3 billion euros. The lawsuits,
which continue after his death, claim Kirch&#8217;s company failed
after Breuer questioned its creditworthiness in a 2002 Bloomberg
TV interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kirch litigation has spawned a separate criminal probe
this year by Munich prosecutors over testimony Breuer gave in
February in another Kirch case. Current Deutsche Bank CEO Josef Ackermann, chairman Clemens Boersig and former board member
Tessen von Heydebreck are also under investigation. Deutsche
Bank has denied wrongdoing by any of its executives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former executive didn&#8217;t admit any liability under the
settlement, which ends one of the numerous cases the Kirch
litigation prompted. Prosecutor Christiane Serini said the trial
developed in a way that made predicting the outcome difficult,
prompting her office to agree to settle. Breuer&#8217;s attorney, who
had sought an acquittal, said the agreement spares his client
the burden of additional months of trial. Breuer himself
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clay Capital&#8217;s James Turner Pleads Guilty in Insider Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James F. Turner II, the chief investment officer of hedge
fund Clay Capital Management LLC, pleaded guilty to his role in
an insider-trading scheme that prosecutors said made more than
$2.5 million in illicit profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turner, 44, admitted yesterday in federal court in Newark,
New Jersey, that he illegally traded in shares of Autodesk Inc. (ADSK),
Moldflow Corp. and Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM) Turner said he got tips
from Scott Vollmar, his brother-in-law and a director of
business development at Autodesk, and from Scott Robarge, a
manager at Salesforce.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turner pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud
before U.S. District Judge Dennis Cavanaugh. Vollmar and Robarge
previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities
fraud, according to Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher Kelly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Bush, Turner&#8217;s attorney, declined to comment after
the plea hearing. Turner was released on $300,000 bail.
Cavanaugh set sentencing for April 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Turner, U.S. District Court, District
of New Jersey (Newark). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fraud Settlements in U.S. Government Cases Exceed $3 Billion &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount the U.S. obtained in cases involving fraud
against the government held steady at about $3 billion in fiscal
year 2011, which ended Sept. 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recoveries under the False Claims Act included $2.4
billion in fraud involving federal health care programs,
Assistant Attorney General Tony West, who heads the Justice
Department&#8217;s civil division, said at a briefing yesterday in
Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the cases resulting in recovered funds were brought
to the government by whistle-blowers, according to the Justice
Department. Whistle-blowers can pursue fraud claims under the
act on behalf of the federal government and then share in any
recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department has recovered $8.7 billion under the
False Claims Act since January 2009, the largest-ever three-year
total, West said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heungkuk Life Insurance Co.&#8217;s
lawsuit against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) over a collateralized
debt obligation was withdrawn from New York state court after
the two sides agreed to resolve the dispute through arbitration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heungkuk sued New York-based Goldman Sachs in federal court
in Manhattan in March over a $1 billion collateralized debt
obligation known as Timberwolf, accusing the company of fraud
and seeking more than $47.3 million in damages. The Seoul-based
insurer filed a similar state-court suit in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal case was voluntarily dismissed in May,
according to court records. The two sides have agreed to
&#8220;pursue the extrajudicial resolution&#8221; of the case in state
court, according to court documents filed today. The state case
was withdrawn &#8220;without prejudice,&#8221; meaning the claims can be
re-filed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case will be resolved through arbitration, Jon Pickhardt, an attorney with Quinn Emanuel Urquhart  Sullivan in
New York who is representing Heungkuk, said in a phone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timberwolf was called &#8220;one shi**y deal&#8221; by a bank
executive in a 2007 internal e-mail written eight days after the
Heungkuk investment, according to the lawsuits. The e-mail was
released publicly by U.S. Senate lawmakers last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Criminal Complaint &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heungkuk filed a criminal complaint against past and
present employees of Goldman Sachs in South Korea relating to
its purchase of a CDO securitization from the firm, the New
York-based company said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission on Aug. 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The filing does not represent any judgment by a
governmental entity, but starts a process whereby the prosecutor
investigates the complaint and determines whether to take
action,&#8221; Goldman Sachs said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heungkuk Life and Heungkuk Fire  Marine Insurance Co.
filed a complaint with the Seoul Central District Prosecutors&#8217;
office on June 28 against nine Goldman Sachs executives and
employees, accusing them of fraud, Lee Yun No, an official at
Heungkuk Life, said on July 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment on today&#8217;s court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Heungkuk Life Insurance Co. v. Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., 650978/2011, New York State Supreme Court, New York
County (Manhattan); and Heungkuk Life Insurance Co. v. Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., 11-cv-1856, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy calls on Ross
Stores, Inc. (ROST) and TJX Cos. (TJX) before a Jan. 5 report on December
same-store sales, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;January $47.50 call options on Ross Stores, a Pleasanton,
California-based discounter, and January $65 calls to buy TJX --
the owner of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, and HomeGoods -- should be
bought before next month&#8217;s International Council of Shopping
Centers report on revenue from stores open at least a year,
equity-derivatives strategists Katherine Fogertey and John Marshall said in a report yesterday. Ross fell 0.5 percent to
$47.64 at 11:59 a.m in New York. TJX slipped 0.2 percent to $63. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategists said retail volatility tends to be high in
November, drop in December, and rise in January, and investors
have a &#8220;good entry point&#8221; because average retail implied
volatility is down more than 20 percent from last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The options market does not appear positioned for a
potential pickup in volatility,&#8221; the strategists wrote. Traders
are &#8220;pricing in continued declines in volatility in January on
average, presenting compelling opportunities to position long
volatility in retail stocks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Value-conscious&#8221; shoppers boosted traffic at discount
retailers and surveys show customers have delayed their holiday
shopping from last year, which could skew trend data, the
Goldman Sachs strategists said, citing Adrianne Shapira, the
firm&#8217;s retail analyst. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ross Stores will post better-than-estimated sales as 48
percent of its stores are on the West Coast, so the company
could benefit from cool temperatures affecting that area, the
report said, while new marketing initiatives at TJX will draw
higher-end consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same-store sales are considered the best measure of a
retailer&#8217;s results because they exclude the effect of store
openings and closings in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based strategists also recommended buying
January $8 MetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS) straddles. A straddle
involves the purchase of a call and put with the same strike
price and expiration, and is a bet that the stock&#8217;s volatility
will rise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) increased
its stake in Enstar Group Ltd. (ESGR), a firm that takes on risks from
insurers seeking to exit businesses, with an investment of about
$181.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchase of 134,184 voting shares and 1.98 million non-

private-equity business, Bermuda-based Enstar said today in a

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was the third-biggest shareholder of Enstar
before today&#8217;s deal, with a 10 percent stake, according to data

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the operator of the
Brazilian offshore well that triggered oil leaks, and rig owner
Transocean Ltd. (RIG) will defend executives threatened with criminal
indictments in the South American nation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron learned that Brazil&#8217;s federal police intend to
indict employees involved in the drilling that led to the Nov. 7
leaks from seafloor fissures near the $3.6 billion Frade
development, Kurt Glaubitz, a spokesman for the San Ramon,
California-based company, said in a statement late yesterday.
Transocean, in a separate statement late yesterday, said it will
&#8220;vigorously defend the company and its collaborators.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the second-largest U.S. energy company by market
value, has been fined 50 million reais ($26.9 million) and
ordered to halt all drilling and crude production off Brazil&#8217;s
coast after discovering the leaks last month. Chevron estimated
the volume of the seeps at 3,000 barrels during the eight days
it took for the company to locate and halt the leaks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron and other offshore oil explorers are facing
increased scrutiny of their drilling practices in the wake of BP
Plc&#8217;s 2010 blowout of a well in the Gulf of Mexico that killed
11 workers and led to the worst U.S. offshore crude spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Brazil, the concerns have been compounded as the coastal
city Rio de Janeiro prepares to host the 2014 World Cup and the
Olympic Games two years later. Chevron&#8217;s Frade oil field is
about 230 miles (370 kilometers) northeast of Rio in a region of
the Atlantic Ocean known as the Campos Basin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees Indicted &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron underestimated the amount of pressure at an oil
deposit it was exploring, and crude leaked from the reservoir
for about eight days, George Buck, president of Chevron&#8217;s
Brazilian subsidiary, said on Nov. 20. Buck was among 17 Chevron
and Transocean employees targeted for indictments, the Folha de
S. Paulo newspaper reported yesterday. Glaubitz declined to
identify the employees targeted for indictment. George wasn&#8217;t
available to comment, the spokesman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthony Dovkants, a spokesman for Vernier, Switzerland-
based Transocean, said in an e-mailed statement that the
allegations were without merit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron rose 0.8 percent to $106.31 at the close as oil
prices climbed above $100 a barrel in New York. Transocean rose
0.4 percent to $40.04. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP has booked more than $40 billion in losses related to
last year&#8217;s Gulf disaster that sank Transocean&#8217;s Deepwater
Horizon rig and spilled an estimated 4.9 million barrels of
crude. The London-based oil producer also faces hundreds of
lawsuits by fishermen, hoteliers and property owners in coastal
areas where crude washed ashore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Oil Spills &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ConocoPhillips, the third-largest U.S. oil company, said
yesterday it&#8217;s taking responsibility for two oil spills in
China&#8217;s Bohai Bay in June and is setting up compensation funds
to support environmental research and affected communities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Europe&#8217;s largest oil company, shut
its 200,000 barrel-a-day Bonga field off Nigeria after a leak
during a tanker loading caused what may be the country&#8217;s worst
offshore spill in more than a decade. The Bonga deep-water
discovery produces almost 10 percent of Nigeria&#8217;s crude. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) of Irving, Texas, is the biggest U.S.
energy company by market value. &lt;/p&gt;

Braun" date="Dec 22, 2011  7:25 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-12-22/massachusetts-saves-as-jpmorgan-beats-bank-of-america-on-bond-sale-bidding.html"><headline>Massachusetts Saves as JPMorgan Beats Bank of America on Bond-Sale Bidding</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The competition between JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) and Bank of America Merrill Lynch to be the top
underwriter of municipal bonds offered by auction helped
Massachusetts save $880,000 on a $400 million borrowing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan won the bid Dec. 20 for the general-obligation
debt maturing from 2015 to 2027, offering an overall interest
cost of 2.57 percent, according to state Treasurer Steven Grossman. Bank of America Merrill Lynch was the second-lowest
bidder, offering 2.79 percent. With the Massachusetts deal,
JPMorgan vaulted ahead of Bank of America for the top
underwriter of competitive municipal bonds issued in 2011 by
$141 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s always a certain amount of competition going on
out there,&#8221; Grossman said in a telephone interview yesterday.
&#8220;That&#8217;s good. We like competition. It didn&#8217;t surprise us to see
Massachusetts trading so well, given the fact that we made a lot
of promises in 2011, early in the year, and we kept the
promises,&#8221; such as boosting the state&#8217;s rainy-day fund and
raising the retirement age for employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nationwide, about 20 percent of debt issued by states and
local governments is sold through competitive bids. Issuers post
public notices asking banks to make proposals and award the debt
to the bidder offering the lowest interest cost. The other 80
percent are done through negotiated underwriting, where
municipalities select a bank to price and sell the bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some academics, including University of Connecticut
professors Mark Robbins and William Simonsen, have found
competitive bond-issues result in lower borrowing costs than
negotiated deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;League Tables &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street pays close attention to the rankings in so-
called league tables because top standing confers bragging
rights. Massachusetts&#8217; bond issue was the biggest competitive
municipal-bond deal scheduled before year-end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We thought we had to be aggressive to win it,&#8221; said
Jeffrey Bosland, JPMorgan&#8217;s head of public finance.
&#8220;Massachusetts is important to us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan structured its bid using coupons of 3 percent and
4 percent to attract individual investors because the debt was
priced closer to par and allowed the bank to lower yields,
Bosland said. The bonds had an eight-year call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerrie McHugh, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC) spokeswoman,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America won an auction for $500 million of
Massachusetts general-obligation debt in September. The Bay
State plans to use the money from this week&#8217;s bond sale to pay
for infrastructure projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top Standing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan won auction on $11.46 billion of bonds with a
&#8220;dated date&#8221; through year-end, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The dated date is the point at which interest begins
to accrue on a fixed-income security. Bank of America won $11.32
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard  Poor&#8217;s raised Massachusetts&#8217; general-obligation
debt to AA+, its second-highest investment grade, from AA on
Sept. 20. The rating company cited the state&#8217;s improving
financial, debt and budget-management practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pension legislation signed by Governor Deval Patrick in
November will raise the retirement age for most state workers
and crack down on pension &#8220;spiking,&#8221; which inflates future
retirement payments by manipulating overtime, unused vacation
and special compensation. The change is projected to save
Massachusetts more than $5 billion over 30 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state has also boosted its rainy-day fund to almost
$1.5 billion, Grossman said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boustead Holdings Bhd. (BOUS), a Malaysian
plantations, engineering and financial services group, is still
interested in buying Exxon Mobil Corp.&#8217;s oil and gas assets in
the Southeast Asian nation if San Miguel Corp. (SMC)&#8217;s planned
acquisition falls through, Group Managing Director Lodin Wok Kamaruddin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon agreed in August to sell its entire 65 percent stake
in Esso Malaysia Bhd. (ESSO) and some other assets in the country to
the Philippine beer-maker for $610 million. While this won
Malaysian government approval last month, the transaction has
yet to be concluded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We first had a discussion with Esso in August last
year,&#8221; Lodin told reporters in Kuala Lumpur today. &#8220;If there
is a review with whomever they have made an agreement with, we
are open and prepared to talk to anyone.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Miguel (SMC) agreed to acquire Exxon&#8217;s entire 65 percent
stake in Kuala Lumpur-listed Esso Malaysia for about $206
million, or 3.50 ringgit per share, giving it control over a
chain of gasoline stations and one refinery with a capacity of
88,000 barrels a day. The Philippines&#8217; largest food and drinks
company also agreed to purchase all of unlisted ExxonMobil
Malaysia Sdn. and Exxon Mobil Borneo Sdn. for a combined $403
million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The takeovers would provide the Manila-based company with
downstream interests including seven fuel distribution terminals
and a network of 560 service stations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would be San Miguel&#8217;s first overseas expansion in the
oil and gas sector. It already owns Petron Corp., the largest of
the Philippines&#8217; two oil refiners. Boustead operates more than
300 service stations in Malaysia under BH Petrol brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Miguel President Ramon Ang wasn&#8217;t immediately available
for comment when text-messaged in Manila today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boustead shares gained 2.1 percent to 5.78 ringgit at 3:02
p.m. in Kuala Lumpur trading, while Esso Malaysia climbed 0.6
percent to 3.41 ringgit. The benchmark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI
Index was 0.1 percent higher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Lembaga Tabung Angkatan Tentera, a Malaysian
armed forces fund, may dilute its stake in Boustead to about 50
percent in the name of good corporate governance, Lodin said.
The fund currently holds 61.2 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s threatened indictment of
Chevron Corp. (CVX) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG) executives after offshore oil
leaks shows that regulators from the North Sea to the Indian
Ocean are stepping up scrutiny after BP Plc&#8217;s 2010 disaster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian authorities have said they may prosecute
employees, shut operations and exact more than $10 billion in
fines after the leaks at the Frade field 230 miles (370
kilometers) off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. The spill occurred
19 months after an explosion in the Gulf of Mexico killed 11
workers and triggered the biggest offshore U.S. oil spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governments around the world are paying closer attention to
how energy explorers drill into high-pressure deposits of crude
and natural gas as much as 8 miles beneath the sea surface.
Chevron&#8217;s Brazil incident took place after a ConocoPhillips (COP) leak
in China and prior to what may be Nigeria&#8217;s biggest spill in a
decade at a Royal Dutch Shell Plc facility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s been just such a rash of them that governments
have got to act tough&#8221; with oil companies, Allen Brooks, a
managing director at energy-investment bank PPHB LP in Houston
and Chevron shareholder, said in a phone interview. Since the BP
accident &#8220;every spill after that is heightened in terms of
media attention and obviously government concern.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was &#8220;limited production impact&#8221; from the power

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V), the world&#8217;s biggest bank-
card network, will deposit $1.57 billion into its litigation
escrow account, the biggest addition in three years as the
company prepares to resolve price-fixing accusations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa will draw on funds allocated to a $2 billion Class A
share-buyback announced this year, the San Francisco-based
company said today in a statement. Because of Visa&#8217;s multiple-
class system of shares, the move will have the same effect on
earnings per share as repurchasing Class A stock, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merchants sued Visa, MasterCard Inc. and banks including
JPMorgan Chase  Co. in 2005, claiming that the companies
squelched competition by banning merchants from steering
customers to cheaper forms of payment. An accord may cost $4
billion, and in February, the defendants agreed that Visa would
be responsible for two-thirds of any settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transferring money away from buybacks &#8220;will exhaust all
funds available under that program,&#8221; Visa said. Class A shares
rose 50 cents to $101.40 at 10:27 a.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A settlement of the case, which involves interchange or
&#8220;swipe&#8221; fees on credit cards, may be at least $4 billion,
according to MasterCard (MA)&#8217;s estimate in November of a possible
loss of at least $500 million. Purchase, New York-based
MasterCard would be responsible for about one-eighth of the
settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa didn&#8217;t specify a purpose for today&#8217;s addition to the
escrow account. The company deposited $1.2 billion into the
account in its 2011 fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30, and
paid out $280 million, increasing the size to $2.86 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm said in its November annual regulatory filing that
the $2.7 billion uncommitted balance of the account was
deposited &#8220;primarily with a view toward resolving&#8221; the price-
fixing litigation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The approved budget was little changed from Exxon&#8217;s
proposal, the news service said, citing the official. The
Russian state awards tax breaks based on companies&#8217; level of
investment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of New York Mellon Corp. will
pay $1.3 million to New York, Texas and Florida to resolve a
probe into manipulative trading of auction-rate securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joint investigation by the Texas State Securities
Board, the Florida Office of Financial Regulation and New York
Attorney General Eric Schneiderman was tied to the actions of
Mellon Financial Markets as an intermediary broker on behalf of
Citizens Property Insurance Corp. of Florida, according to
statements from Schneiderman&#8217;s office and the Florida and Texas
agencies. The settlement includes penalties, fees and costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auction-rate securities are municipal bonds, corporate
bonds and preferred stocks whose rates of return are
periodically reset through auctions. The market for the
securities collapsed in February 2008 after major dealers
withdrew their support for the auctions, causing most of them to
fail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From January 2008 to February 2008, Mellon Financial
enabled Citizens Property to buy large quantities of its own
auction-rate securities by placing bids in its own auctions as
if it were an independent third-party buyer, Schneiderman&#8217;s
office said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citizens Property knew that broker-dealers who were
managing the securities would have rejected the bids and asked
for help from Mellon Financial Markets, which agreed to submit
the trades to help the Florida insurer avoid detection,
Schneiderman&#8217;s office said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citizens Property&#8217;s bids were below market rates and
resulted in the auctions clearing at rates lower than they would
have had the insurer not intervened, Schneiderman&#8217;s office said.
Investors earned $6.7 million less in interest than they would
have had Citizens not joined the auctions, the Texas State
Securities Board said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mellon Financial &#8220;traders and their managers understood
that CPIC&#8217;s bidding would set clearing rates lower than they
would have been in the absence of such bidding, and that this
would be both detrimental and objectionable to other investors
bidding on or holding CPIC&#8217;s auction rate securities,&#8221;
Schneiderman&#8217;s office said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;BNY Mellon Capital Markets is pleased to have resolved
this matter, which centered on the isolated conduct of three
individuals who are no longer with the company,&#8221; Ron Sommer, a
Bank of New York Mellon spokesman, said in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be inappropriate for Citizens Property Insurance
to comment on the settlement, Christine Ashburn, director of
legislative and external affairs for the Tallahassee-based
company, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is important to recognize that Citizens was vigilant
in obtaining guidance from outside legal counsel prior to
engaging in these transactions,&#8221; Ashburn said. &#8220;We continue to
believe that our actions were legally permissible, and we remain
committed to providing any information regulators may request.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-New Star Founder Refutes Former Fund Manager&#8217;s Bullying Claim &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Duffield, founder of New Star Asset Management
Holdings Inc., denied claims made by a former fund manager that
he bullied his staff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick Evershed made &#8220;extreme and colorful statements&#8221;
at an employment tribunal hearing in a dispute that was
subsequently settled this month, Duffield said in comments on a
website. The case was settled before New Star could fully refute
them in court, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Patrick made a number of statements that were exposed as
misleading during cross-examination or were refuted under oath
by New Star&#8217;s witnesses before he truncated the hearing,&#8221;
Duffield said on his website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evershed sued New Star for unfair dismissal after being
suspended in 2008 by the fund&#8217;s chief executive officer, Howard
Covington. The suspension came shortly after Evershed wrote a
letter to New Star&#8217;s human resources department complaining
about Duffield&#8217;s conduct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;d love to give a detailed response to some of the
points, but I can&#8217;t,&#8221; Evershed said of Duffield&#8217;s comments in a
telephone interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evershed and New Star &#8220;reached an agreement which resolves
the employment tribunal proceedings without admission of
liability,&#8221; Henderson Group said in an e-mailed statement.
&#8220;Both parties are satisfied with the terms of the agreement,
and have agreed to keep them confidential.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ex-Secret Service Official Wins Dismissal of Conspiracy Charge &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conspiracy charges were dismissed against a former Secret
Service official and five other security-company executives in
the first prosecution of alleged foreign bribery based on a
government sting operation run inside the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Richard Leon yesterday threw out the
conspiracy charge at the defendants&#8217; request after the
government finished presenting its case to a federal jury in
Washington. Five of the executives still face additional foreign
bribery charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors allege that R. Patrick Caldwell, former chief
executive officer of Protective Products of America Inc. and an
ex-deputy assistant director at the Secret Service, joined an
illegal business deal by agreeing to make payments to an FBI
agent posing as a representative of the west African country of
Gabon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leon&#8217;s ruling, which he made from the bench after 12 weeks
of trial, resulted in the acquittal of Stephen Giordanella,
Caldwell&#8217;s predecessor at Protective Products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Judge Leon followed the law and made a correct and just
decision,&#8221; said Paul Calli, lawyer for Giordanella. &#8220;Mr.
Giordanella should have never been charged. He was innocent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alisa Finelli, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined
to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial that opened Sept. 28 is the second in a 22-defendant kickback conspiracy case stemming from a fake $15
million weapons deal. It&#8217;s the biggest prosecution of
individuals accused of violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act, or FCPA. A trial of four others arrested in the sting ended
in a mistrial in July after a jury failed to agree on a verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other defendants are John Mushriqui, Jeana Mushriqui,
John Godsey and Marc Morales. Each was charged with one count of
conspiracy and two to five counts of bribery. The bribery
charges carry maximum five-year prison sentences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All six have pleaded not guilty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Goncalves, 09-cr-00335, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Madoff Sons Can&#8217;t Appeal in $198 Million Suit, Judge Rules &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernard Madoff&#8217;s sons can&#8217;t appeal a bankruptcy judge&#8217;s
decision to permit a $198 million claim against them to go
forward, a federal judge in Manhattan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge William Pauley yesterday declined to
hear an appeal of the September decision in favor of Irving
Picard, the trustee liquidating Bernard L. Madoff Investment
Securities LLC, in his claim against several Madoff family
members including Andrew Madoff and the estate of Mark Madoff,
who committed suicide in December 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the suit, filed in 2009, Picard claimed Madoff&#8217;s family
used the firm as their &#8220;family piggy bank&#8221; and should be
forced to turn over the money to victims of Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi
scheme. He sued Mark and Andrew Madoff as well as Bernard
Madoff&#8217;s brother Peter Madoff and his niece, Shana Madoff
Swanson. All the defendants held senior positions at the Madoff
firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard claimed that the defendants failed to stop Madoff&#8217;s
fraud, instead choosing to profit from it. In the September
ruling, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Lifland ruled that Picard
could pursue most of his claims against the Madoffs and gave him
the opportunity to amend his complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 73, who pleaded guilty to charges of masterminding
the biggest Ponzi scheme in history, is serving a 150-year term
in a federal prison in North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanda Remus, a spokeswoman for Picard, declined to comment
on yesterday&#8217;s ruling. Martin Flumenbaum, who represents Andrew
Madoff and Mark Madoff&#8217;s estate, didn&#8217;t immediately return a
voice-mail message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is: Picard v. Estate of Mark Madoff, 11-Misc.-379,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apple Unlikely to Win German Ban on Samsung Galaxy 10.1N &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL) is unlikely to win a ban on sales of Samsung (005930)
Electronics Co.&#8217;s Galaxy 10.1N tablet computer, a modified
version introduced after sales of the original tablet were
blocked, a German court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dusseldorf court that banned sales of the Galaxy 10.1
on Sept. 9 is unlikely to grant Apple an injunction against the
Galaxy 10.1N, Presiding Judge Johanna Brueckner-Hofmann said at
a hearing yesterday. Samsung has changed the device&#8217;s design
sufficiently to distance it from the iPad, she said, adding that
the view is preliminary. A ruling was scheduled for Feb. 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Consumers are well aware that there is an original and
that competitors try to use similar designs, so buyers are
vigilant when looking at products,&#8221; Brueckner-Hofmann said.
&#8220;We don&#8217;t think that someone buys a Samsung to make his table
neighbor at the coffee house believe he owns an iPad.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple has faced setbacks in its legal fight against
Samsung, its closest rival in tablet computers, since its
initial September success in Germany. The iPad maker failed to
convince an Australian court on Dec. 9 to reinstate a ban in
that country and two days ago, a Dusseldorf court voiced doubts
about the reach of Apple&#8217;s European Union design right that was
the basis for the company&#8217;s Sept. 9 injunction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Samsung tablet has thicker edges and the front
screen has speakers which distinguish it from the iPad, the
court said. There is also a broad Samsung label that ensures
consumers aren&#8217;t confused, according to the judges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple&#8217;s lawyer Matthias Koch argued that Samsung is still
exploiting the reputation of the iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung lawyer Thomas Musmann argued that Cupertino,
California-based Apple is trying to monopolize the tablet
format. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s case is LG Dusseldorf, 14c O 292/11. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Chevron, Transocean Face Brazil Indictment Over Oil Leak &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the operator of the Brazilian offshore well
that triggered oil leaks, and rig owner Transocean Ltd. (RIG) will
defend executives threatened with criminal indictments in the
South American nation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron learned that Brazil&#8217;s federal police intend to
indict employees involved in the drilling that led to the Nov. 7
leaks from seafloor fissures near the $3.6 billion Frade
development, Kurt Glaubitz, a spokesman for the San Ramon,
California-based company, said in a statement Dec. 21.
Transocean, in a separate statement Dec. 21, said it will
&#8220;vigorously defend the company and its collaborators.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the second-largest U.S. energy company by market
value, has been fined 50 million reais ($26.9 million) and
ordered to halt all drilling and crude production off Brazil&#8217;s
coast after discovering the leaks last month. Chevron estimated
the volume of the seeps at 3,000 barrels during the eight days
it took for the company to locate and halt the leaks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron and other offshore oil explorers are facing
increased scrutiny of their drilling practices in the wake of BP (BP/)
Plc&#8217;s 2010 blowout of a well in the Gulf of Mexico that killed
11 workers and led to the worst U.S. offshore crude spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron underestimated the amount of pressure at an oil
deposit it was exploring, and crude leaked from the reservoir
for about eight days, George Buck, president of Chevron&#8217;s
Brazilian subsidiary, said on Nov. 20. Buck was among 17 Chevron
and Transocean employees targeted for indictments, the Folha de
S. Paulo newspaper reported Dec. 21. Glaubitz declined to
identify the employees targeted for indictment. George wasn&#8217;t
available to comment, the spokesman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthony Dovkants, a spokesman for Vernier, Switzerland-based Transocean, said in an e-mailed statement that the
allegations were without merit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Electronic Arts Must Defend Activision Contract Claims at Trial &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronic Arts Inc. (EA), the second-biggest U.S. video-game
publisher, lost a court bid to dismiss the $400-million
contract-interference claims by its larger rival Activision
Blizzard Inc. (ATVI) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California Superior Court Judge Elihu Berle, at a hearing
Dec. 21 in Los Angeles, denied Electronic Arts&#8217; request to throw
out the claims, saying Activision had provided sufficient
evidence that a jury should decide whether Electronic Arts broke
the law by talking to two creators of Activision&#8217;s &#8220;Call of
Duty&#8221; franchise while they were still under contract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berle rejected Electronic Arts&#8217; argument that it was
perfectly lawful for the two top executives of Activision&#8217;s
Infinity Ward studio, Jason West and Vince Zampella, to explore
future employment opportunities. It was &#8220;a whole different
scenario&#8221; if Electronic Arts approached the two executives
while there was still more than two years left on their
contract, the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activision, based in Santa Monica, California, last year
added Electronic Arts as a cross-defendant to a lawsuit that was
initially brought by West and Zampella after they were fired.
They had sued for $36 million, saying Activision fired them to
avoid paying the royalties they were owed for &#8220;Call of Duty:
Modern Warfare 2,&#8221; the top-selling game the previous year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Klieger, a lawyer for Redwood City, California-based
Electronic Arts, declined to comment after the hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re pleased with the ruling and look forward to proving
our case at trial,&#8221; Steven Marenberg, a lawyer for Activision,
said after the hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is West v. Activision, SC107041, California
Superior Court (Los Angeles County). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;NCAA Denies Claims in Head Injury Suit by Ex-Collegiate Athletes &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Collegiate Athletic Association denied claims
in a lawsuit filed by former college football players who accuse
it of profiting from athletes while neglecting those who suffer
concussions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response, filed Dec. 21 in federal court in Chicago,
addresses claims raised in a class-action lawsuit brought by 25-year-old Adrian Arrington, a former football player for Eastern
Illinois University. Where it doesn&#8217;t deny the allegations, the
NCAA says it is &#8220;without knowledge&#8221; of the practices that
Arrington and other athletes say show a failure to enforce
safety measures to protect players from head injuries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NCAA said in the court filing that it earned revenue of
$749.8 million in the 2009-2010 season, and that it doesn&#8217;t pay
salaries to student-athletes. The organization also responded to
arguments that it doesn&#8217;t require its member institutions to
educate athletes about reporting concussions and their symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Each member institution is responsible for protecting the
health of its student-athletes,&#8221; according to the filing. The
NCAA said that &#8220;for decades it has provided appropriate
information and guidance on concussions to its member
institutions&#8221; and encourages those schools to educate athletes
about &#8220;symptoms associated with concussions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Arrington v. NCAA, 11-6356, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago), and Owens v.
NCAA, 11-6816, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
Illinois (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trials &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Allen Stanford Found Mentally Fit for January Fraud Trial &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R. Allen Stanford is mentally fit to stand trial and will
face a jury next month on charges he swindled investors of more
than $7 billion, a U.S. judge ruled. The trial is to begin with
jury selection on Jan. 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford&#8217;s defense team argued unsuccessfully that his
mental capacity was diminished by head injuries he suffered in a
2009 jailhouse assault and the effects of powerful anxiety
medications prescribed in prison after the beating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have found by a preponderance of the evidence that
Stanford is competent to stand trial,&#8221; U.S. District Judge
David Hittner in Houston said yesterday in finding Stanford able
to assist in his defense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hittner&#8217;s ruling followed 2 1/2 days of debate over the
extent of brain damage Stanford, 61, suffered from the assault
and the extent to which he might be faking memory loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Stanford, 09-cr-342, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cameron Asks Court to Scuttle BP Gulf Spill Trial Plan &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameron International Corp. (CAM) asked a federal appeals court
to derail the February nonjury trial over which companies should
be blamed for the 2010 BP Plc oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameron, which made the blow-out prevention equipment used
for the Macondo well, asked a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals
meeting in Dallas to throw out the existing trial plan and rule
that the company has a right to a trial before a jury. U.S.
District Judge Carl Barbier, who is overseeing much of the spill
litigation, has scheduled the nonjury trial for Feb. 27 in New
Orleans to determine liability and apportion fault. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barbier plans two subsequent nonjury phases on the size of
the spill and efforts to contain it. Test jury trials on damages
would follow, the judge said. Cameron, which settled damage
claims with BP last week, said the trial plan violates its
constitutional rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is not a claim against Cameron that does not
implicate our right to a jury trial under the Seventh
Amendment,&#8221; Russell Post, a Cameron attorney, told the judges
at the hearing in federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The April 2010 Macondo well blowout and the explosion that
followed killed 11 workers and set off the worst offshore oil
spill in U.S. history. The accident and spill led to hundreds of
lawsuits against BP and its partners and contractors, including
Cameron, Transocean Ltd., the Switzerland-based owner and
operator of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig that exploded and
Halliburton Co. (HAL), which provided cementing services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals case is In re: Cameron International,
11-30987, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The
lawsuits are combined in In re Oil Spill by the Oil Rig
Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010,
MDL-2179, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana
(New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Litigation Departments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Convicted Swindler Rothstein Says Partners Knew of Scheme &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott Rothstein, the Florida lawyer convicted in a $1.2
billion investment fraud, said two of his former law firm
partners also knew of the scheme, according to a transcript of a
sworn deposition made public Dec.22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rothstein, sentenced to 50 years in prison, said his former
partners, Stuart Rosenfeldt and Russell Adler, were aware of the
scheme, according to a transcript of the deposition taken this
month at the federal courthouse in Miami as part of their law
firm&#8217;s bankruptcy case. The transcript was posted on the website
of the law firm Conrad  Scherer, which represents some of the
investors seeking to recover money invested in the scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They knew that we were moving money illegally in and out
of the law firm,&#8221; Rothstein said of Rosenfeldt and Adler,
according to the transcript. &#8220;At various points in time, they
came to know that there was a Ponzi scheme going on, although
the word Ponzi was never utilized.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rothstein, formerly of Rothstein Rosenfeldt Adler PA in
Fort Lauderdale, Florida, pleaded guilty in January 2010 to five
counts of racketeering, money laundering and wire fraud after
admitting he sold investors interests in bogus settlements in
sexual-harassment and whistle-blower lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bruce Lehr, a lawyer for Rosenfeldt, said Dec. 22 in a
phone interview that his client wasn&#8217;t aware of the Ponzi
scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Stuart Rosenfeldt had absolutely no idea of the
wrongdoings of Scott Rothstein until Mr. Rothstein fled the
country,&#8221; Lehr said. &#8220;Mr. Rothstein, who pleaded guilty and
was sentenced to 50 years in prison, had no credibility then.
The fact that after spending some time behind bars, he has
decided to throw his law partner under the bus has not awarded
him new credibility.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adler&#8217;s attorney, Fred Haddad, said Rothstein was lying
about his client. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He didn&#8217;t know anything about what Rothstein was doing,&#8221;
Haddad said. &#8220;I like Scott personally. I&#8217;ve gotten drunk with
Scott. But he said at the beginning of his depo that this would
be the first time in his life that he&#8217;s told the truth. I think
he still hasn&#8217;t reached the first time in his life to tell the
truth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosenfeldt and Adler haven&#8217;t been charged with wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Rothstein Rosenfeldt Adler PA, 09-34791,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Southern Florida (Fort
Lauderdale). &lt;/p&gt;

leveled the Italian town and its hilltop abbey. Now, the 33,000
residents are digging out from the rubble left by Wall Street. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six decades after U.S.-led forces ousted the Nazis from
Cassino, a new generation is grappling with the fallout from the
debts of postwar rebuilding -- borrowings that grew because of a
derivative that backfired. Soaring costs forced Cassino, 80
miles southeast of Rome, to settle an interest-rate swap with
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) in 2009, leaving the town unable to pay for
daycare for 60 infants and services for the poor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Iris Volante, who chairs Cassino&#8217;s assembly finance
committee, the bankers who share responsibility for peddling the
derivatives should pay with their jobs. She, like Occupy Wall
Street protesters around the world, is demanding an overhaul of
the financial system to stop history from repeating itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Heads rolling is the least we would expect,&#8221; Volante, a
57-year-old gynecologist who also has worked for the city for
more than a decade, said in an interview in a Cassino cafe
earlier this month. &#8220;When people&#8217;s attitude is to cheat others,
new rules are needed to prevent it happening again.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cassino, whose government office overlooks a U.S. tank and
other war relics in the town&#8217;s central square, plans to cut
funding for its daycare center and may ask families to pay
several hundred euros a month per child after running out of
other cost-cutting measures, said Volante. The town already has
reduced staff to about 250 employees from about 450 by not
replacing those who left or retired, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milan Trial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the New York-based bank led by Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon has no retail branches in Italy, it didn&#8217;t
hesitate to sell complex swaps to municipalities over the past
decade. In Milan, JPMorgan and its employees are on trial, along
with Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Germany&#8217;s Depfa Bank Plc
and Switzerland&#8217;s UBS AG, for allegedly tricking the city into
buying the contracts in 2005. The banks deny any wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across Italy, cities faced with shrinking income and rising
expenses bought swaps from JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by
assets, and other lenders to cut short-term interest costs,
putting them at risk of paying more in the long run. Cassino
purchased a 22 million-euro ($28.7 million) contract from New
York-based Bear Stearns Cos., acquired by JPMorgan in 2008,
which switched interest payments on the town&#8217;s debt from a fixed
rate to a variable one. The rate, a record low at the time the
contract was signed in 2003, soared over subsequent years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 300 municipalities, from the toe of Italy&#8217;s boot to
the Alps, were losing a total of 912 million euros on such
derivatives as of March, Bank of Italy data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for JPMorgan in London,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferson County &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local governments and regulators in Germany and the U.S.
also have brought cases against banks, including JPMorgan, over
derivatives contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The German city of Pforzheim sued JPMorgan a year ago over
56 million euros of losses on interest-rate swaps. A hearing at
the Frankfurt Regional Court is scheduled for Jan. 16. Marchiony
declined to comment on the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., JPMorgan was investigated by the Justice
Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and attorneys
general in 25 states for its role in rigging the bids of
investment contracts. The bank agreed to a $228 million
settlement this year on charges that it conspired to overcharge
cities at taxpayer expense, acknowledging responsibility for
illegal, anticompetitive conduct by former employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, JPMorgan entered a $722 million accord with the
SEC to end an investigation into its role in selling derivatives
that helped push Jefferson County, Alabama, to declare the
biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. The bank paid $75
million in fines and restitution and wrote off $647 million it
was owed by the county. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest-Rate Swaps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sales happened before Dimon took over as CEO in 2006.
In September 2008, the bank said it would stop marketing
interest-rate swaps to municipalities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks globally sold $707.6 trillion of over-the-counter
derivatives as of June 30, about 18 percent more than the $601
trillion at the end of 2010, according to data published by the
Bank for International Settlements last month. Counterparties
would have to pay $19.5 trillion to replace the contracts at
market rates, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest-rate swaps account for more than three-quarters of
the total, BIS data show. The Basel, Switzerland-based group
doesn&#8217;t break out what percentage is bought by municipalities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was the largest global dealer of interest-rate
derivatives among U.S. banks in the third quarter, according to
data from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The
bank had $75.4 trillion in notional derivatives within its
JPMorgan Chase Bank NA subsidiary, of which 77 percent, or about
$58.1 trillion, were interest-rate contracts, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Without Thinking&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, 55, led the charge in the U.S. against new banking
regulation, criticizing Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke
in June for saddling lenders with too many proposed rules. The
rules, to be overseen by the Fed, are meant to avert future
financial crises and banking abuses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Banks pitched deals without thinking about the well-being
of others and created lots of financial problems for many
towns,&#8221; said Carmelo Palombo, a former Cassino official who
helped negotiate the settlement with JPMorgan. The agreement
stopped the city from losing even more money, said Palombo,
without providing details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secret Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2001 Italian law said local authorities could buy swaps
only if the transactions would improve municipal finances. Italy
banned governments from signing new derivatives contracts in
mid-2008, and the Senate finance committee approved
recommendations in March 2010 that would prevent towns that
aren&#8217;t provincial capitals and have fewer than 100,000 residents
from using derivatives. Those rules are still pending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cassino sought to keep the settlement terms secret, citing
a confidentiality clause in its agreement with JPMorgan. An
administrative court in Latina, Italy, in September backed a
case brought by Bloomberg News under Italian freedom of
information law asking the town to make the swaps contract and
settlement public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city plans to comply with the court order, said Enzo
Salera, Cassino&#8217;s finance chief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Milan, Dimon&#8217;s bankers say they played by the book,
adhering to rules that allow swaps dealers to withhold details,
including how much they&#8217;re charging their customers. Hidden
charges on derivatives contracts are what Milan prosecutor
Alfredo Robledo says made them fraudulent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robledo says banks charged 101 million euros in fees in
selling the derivatives that adjusted payments on the city&#8217;s 1.7
billion-euro bond offering in 2005 and in later restructurings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross Margin &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Every time I sold a derivative to a public
administration, even before getting to the details, the first
question was always, &#8216;How does the bank make money?&#8217;&#8221; Antonia Creanza, an executive director at JPMorgan in London said in
court Sept. 21 under questioning by her lawyer. &#8220;I would
explain that we would retain a margin. Never has a legal adviser
told me, &#8216;Look you need to detail the gross margin.&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks seek to earn a gross margin when they agree to a swap
with a client by skewing the terms to their advantage, Creanza,
42, a member of the bank&#8217;s interest-rate team at the time of the
Milan deal, testified on Sept. 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gross margin is &#8220;photographed&#8221; when the deal is
struck, Creanza said. That value is then managed by a trader
over the life of the contract, its magnitude varying as the
derivative agreement changes in value, she said. The final
profit for the bank can&#8217;t be known until maturity, said Creanza,
who declined to elaborate further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Asymmetry of Information&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank didn&#8217;t tell the city of Milan how much it was
charging, and the municipality could have sought competing bids
from other banks or independent advice, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creanza said she earned a bonus that year, a payment
JPMorgan had guaranteed irrespective of her performance when the
firm lured her from a competitor in December 2004. She didn&#8217;t
say what the bonus was. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city of Milan is seeking damages as part of the
criminal trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s an asymmetry of information between banks and
local governments, which have stringent limits, not least in
their spending,&#8221; Letizia Moratti, 62, Milan&#8217;s mayor from 2006
through May of this year, said in court last month. &#8220;There was
a clear conflict that the banks didn&#8217;t highlight.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watershed Events &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Cassino, which lies on an ancient road connecting Naples
and Rome, residents curse two watershed events: the five-month
battle in 1944 that claimed more than 70,000 casualties and
turned the town into a moonscape, and the day in 2003 that the
government entered a seven-year swap with Bear Stearns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contract, which adjusted payments on about 22 million
euros of debt, switched the city&#8217;s 4.7 percent fixed interest
rate for a variable one, according to a June 2009 report by
Italy&#8217;s financial police. The floating rate was based on the
U.S.-dollar London interbank offered rate, or Libor, an
&#8220;extremely risky&#8221; bet given that it was at a record low,
police said in testimony to the Italian Senate that month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three-month U.S. dollar-Libor was at 1 percent in June 2003
and by January 2006 had surpassed 4.7 percent, according to data
compiled by the British Bankers&#8217; Association. The measure
climbed as high as 5.7 percent in September 2007 as credit
markets began to seize up, before declining to a record low of
0.25 percent by December 2009 after policy makers cut rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depleted Funds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cassino started losing money on the swap with the third
half-yearly payment, paying about 2 million euros after Libor
soared, according to police testimony. That depleted funds
intended for sanitation and road works that the city raises from
parking tickets and federal grants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction was presented as advantageous to the
municipality at the time, said Volante, who worked as a city
culture chief when Bear Stearns pitched the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Cassino, whose rundown postwar architecture bears
little of the ancient charm of neighboring towns, the challenge
now is to cut services without damaging the most vulnerable
residents, said Danilo Grossi, the city&#8217;s education chief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new administration, which took over after May elections,
will boost charges for the city-run nursery starting next year
to help pay the 900,000 euros it costs to operate annually, said
Grossi. Talks with the families have begun, he said. The town is
still grappling with a shortfall that in 2010 forced out the
previous administration and led the federal government to take
financial control of the municipality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helping the Poor &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cassino&#8217;s pain has increased as Italy&#8217;s economy contracted
in the third quarter, signaling that the country may have
entered its fifth recession since 2001. Facing soaring borrowing
costs amid investor concern that the nation may struggle to
repay its debt, Prime Minister Mario Monti&#8217;s government is
adopting austerity measures that may further weigh on growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Cassino eventually extracted itself from the swap,
the damage may be lasting, according to Giuseppe Lauro, a
retired manager for Italy&#8217;s largest power company, Enel SpA (ENEL), who
now volunteers for church-sponsored charity Caritas Italiana.
The shrinking local economy and cuts in city spending are
creating a growing class of poor, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a foggy December morning, as local politicians were busy
hosting Italy&#8217;s Chamber Speaker Gianfranco Fini to mark the
150th anniversary of the nation&#8217;s unification with songs in the
town&#8217;s Teatro Manzoni, Lauro was looking after the poor, picking
up the pieces of the city&#8217;s financial wreckage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About half of those who sought assistance from Caritas in
Cassino for the first time in 2009 were of working age, seeking
help with paying bills and food and clothes, a 2009 study by the
charity showed. More than half of those who relied on Caritas
were below 40. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We need more city funds,&#8221; Lauro, 66, said in an
interview at the charity&#8217;s shelter, a few hundred yards from
town hall. &#8220;The city&#8217;s demise means there are new poor and
they&#8217;re younger. They need jobs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy options on
Merck  Co., Medtronic Inc. (MDT), Humana Inc. (HUM) and other health-care
companies because their presentations at a Jan. 5 conference may
increase volatility, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katherine Fogertey and John Marshall recommended buying
January options strangles, a strategy that involves purchasing a
put and call with the same maturity and strike price, to profit
from bigger stock swings by eight health-care companies set to
appear at the Goldman Sachs Healthcare CEO conference. Next
month&#8217;s contracts are attractive because they aren&#8217;t pricing in
bigger moves, the strategists wrote in a note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Buying January options in health-care stocks ahead of
this event is attractive,&#8221; the New York-based strategists
wrote. &#8220;The market is not expecting material stock moving
catalysts in the coming month.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors can pay 3.3 percent on average for January
options that are about 2 percent above and below the stock
prices for the eight companies, the strategists wrote. The trade
starts to profit if the shares rise 4.9 percent on average or
fall 5.6 percent by expiration on Jan. 20, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman recommended the $37-$38 strangles for both Merck,
the second-biggest U.S. drugmaker, and Medtronic, the world&#8217;s
biggest maker of heart-rhythm devices. They cited the $87.50-$90
straddle on Humana, the second-largest U.S. Medicare managed-
care provider. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategists also recommended strangles on Watson
Pharmaceuticals, a Parsippany, New Jersey-based generic-drug
maker, because regulatory approval of Prochieve, a drug that
helps reduce risk of premature birth, and sales of generic
Lipitor, may boost the company&#8217;s 2012 outlook. Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co. (BMY), Biogen Idec Inc. (BIIB), Celgene Corp. (CELG) and Allergan Inc.
also are attractive strangles, they said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A group of institutional investors
including BlackRock Inc. (BLK) persuaded a federal appeals court to
consider its request to return an $8.5 billion bond settlement
with Bank of America (BAC) Corp. to state court for a judge&#8217;s
approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals in New York yesterday agreed to
review the appeal of U.S. District Judge William Pauley&#8217;s ruling
in October to keep the case in federal court for review, rather
than remanding it to New York State Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed agreement, first filed in New York state
court, would settle claims from investors in the mortgage bonds
of Countrywide Financial Corp., which Charlotte, North Carolina-
based Bank of America bought in 2008. The deal was reached with
the institutional investor group that includes BlackRock and
Pacific Investment Management Co. and would apply to 530
mortgage-securitization trusts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK), the trustee for the
mortgage-bond trusts, filed the settlement in state court and
planned to seek approval of it there. Under the state
proceeding, approval would bind investors outside the group that
negotiated the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An investor group, Walnut Place LLC and related entities,
moved the case to federal court and is fighting the bid to
return it to state court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bank of New York Mellon v. Walnut Place LLC,
11-4554, 11-4571, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BP&#8217;s McKay to Testify at Gulf Oil Spill Liability Trial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP America Inc. Chairman and President Lamar McKay, BP
Plc (BP/)&#8217;s highest-ranking U.S. executive, was subpoenaed to testify
at the February trial that will determine liability for the 2010
Gulf of Mexico oil spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP faces at least 350 lawsuits by thousands of coastal
property owners and businesses claiming damages from the more
than 4.1 million barrels of oil that gushed from the company&#8217;s
well off the Louisiana coast last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuits were consolidated for pretrial processing by
U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier in New Orleans. Also sued in
the combined cases are Transocean Ltd. (RIG), which owned the
Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, and Halliburton Co. (HAL), which
provided cementing services to the well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barbier scheduled a nonjury trial to begin Feb. 27 to
determine which companies share blame for the explosion. The
judge has said he&#8217;ll use findings from the liability trial to
guide decisions in later trial phases over damages caused by
efforts to contain and clean up the historic spill, which killed
11 workers and caused the worst offshore oil spill in U.S.
history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP, based in London, accepted responsibility for the spill
and set up a $20 billion fund to compensate victims for spill-
related losses. BP sued Vernier, Switzerland-based Transocean
and Houston-based Halliburton on claims its contractors share
blame for the disaster and should share the costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transocean and Halliburton have repeatedly denied any fault
for the explosion or spill in court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re: Oil Spill by the Oil Rig Deepwater
Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010, MDL-2179, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Released From Probation in Prudhoe Bay Spill by Judge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc didn&#8217;t violate a plea agreement in a criminal case
over a 2006 spill in Alaska&#8217;s Prudhoe Bay, a judge ruled,
rejecting a request by federal prosecutors to revoke the
company&#8217;s probation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP pleaded guilty in 2007 to violating the Clean Water Act
by spilling 200,000 gallons of oil from its Prudhoe Bay field
into water on Alaska&#8217;s North Slope in 2006. It paid a $12
million fine and $8 million for restitution and community
service and was put on three years&#8217; probation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government asked U.S. District Judge Ralph Beistline in
Anchorage to revoke the probation, saying London-based BP broke
the agreement when it spilled about 13,500 gallons of oil near
Prudhoe Bay in November 2009. Beistline rejected the U.S.
request yesterday and released the company from probation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The court certainly cannot fault the government for the
position it has taken in this matter for there clearly were
reasons for concern,&#8221; Beistline wrote in an order. &#8220;There can
be no doubt that the government takes its responsibility
seriously to monitor the industry and to ensure compliance with
environmental laws.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased with the decision,&#8221; Steve Rinehart, BP
spokesman, said in an e-mail. &#8220;We know that the privilege of
working in Alaska comes with a responsibility to maintain high
standards. We will continue our commitment to running safe and
compliant operations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyn Hornbuckle, a Justice Department spokesman, didn&#8217;t
return an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc., 3:07-
cr-00125, U.S. District Court, District of Alaska (Anchorage). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Suit Should Be Put on Hold During Appeal, SEC Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asked a federal
appeals court to put an emergency hold on its lawsuit against
Citigroup Inc. (C) over mortgage-backed securities, and to expedite
its appeal of a judge&#8217;s rejection of a $285 million settlement
in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup consented to the requests, the SEC said in a
filing yesterday with the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York. The
agency is challenging U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff&#8217;s refusal
last month to approve an accord resolving claims that New York-
based Citigroup misled investors in a $1 billion financial
product linked to risky mortgages. It said halting the case was
necessary because Rakoff told Citigroup to respond to the SEC&#8217;s
complaint next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The commission seeks a stay on an emergency basis because
the Jan. 3 deadline for Citigroup to answer creates an exigency
that threatens the commission with additional irreparable
harm,&#8221; the regulator said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his Nov. 28 ruling, Rakoff criticized the agency&#8217;s
practice of settling without requiring the subject of the
allegations to admit wrongdoing. The Manhattan judge said the
Citigroup settlement didn&#8217;t provide him with &#8220;any proven or
admitted facts&#8221; to inform his judgment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC said it wanted to preserve agency resources by
putting the case on hold while the appeals court considers
Rakoff&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We respectfully disagree with the court&#8217;s ruling and
believe the settlement fully complies with long-established
legal standards,&#8221; Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a spokeswoman for
Citigroup, said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;In the event the
case is tried, we would present substantial factual and legal
defenses to the charges.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v.
Citigroup Global Markets Inc., 11-05227, U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit (New York). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharp, Samsung Agree on $539 Million to End Antitrust Cases &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharp Corp., Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) and five other makers
of liquid crystal display panels used in computers and
televisions agreed to pay $538.6 million to settle antitrust
claims by indirect purchasers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the panel makers agreed to pay $388
million to settle price-fixing claims by direct buyers of the
products as part of a series of cases consolidated in federal
court in San Francisco. Under the new agreement, about $501
million will be available for partial refunds to consumers and
about $37 million to compensate governments and other public
entities for damages, according to a court filing dated Dec. 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies allegedly fixed prices of thin-film liquid
crystal display panels, driving up prices for purchasers of
televisions, notebook computers and monitors from 1999 to 2006,
according to a class action, or group, lawsuit filed in 2007.
The attorneys general of eight states, including Florida,
California and New York, were part of the settlement agreements
with the manufacturers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Price-fixing is detrimental to Florida&#8217;s consumers,
governmental agencies, and the economy,&#8221; Pam Bondi, Florida&#8217;s
attorney general, said in a statement. &#8220;I am pleased that we
will be able to return funds to those who were harmed by this
illegal and deceptive behavior.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York taxpayers may receive as much as $11 million from
the settlement, according to a release from the state&#8217;s attorney
general, Eric Schneiderman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the $538.6 million settlement of the antitrust
claims, five of the companies also agreed to pay more than $14
million in civil fines and penalties to New York, according to
the statement from Schneiderman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This price-fixing scheme manipulated the playing field
for businesses that abide by the rules, and left consumers to
pay artificially higher costs for televisions, computers and
other electronics,&#8221; Schneiderman said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re TFT-LCD (Flat Panel) Antitrust
Litigation, 07-01827, U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hawker Beechcraft Sues U.S. Over Aircraft Contract Exclusion &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawker Beechcraft Co., the jet maker part-owned by Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS), said a unit asked a federal judge to block the
U.S. Air Force from awarding an almost $1 billion contract for
light attack aircraft, claiming the government won&#8217;t say why it
was excluded from consideration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawker Beechcraft Defense Co. sued the U.S. yesterday in
the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in Washington challenging the
Air Force&#8217;s exclusion of the Beechcraft AT-6 from the Light Air
Support competition. The lawsuit was filed after the U.S.
Government Accountability Office on Dec. 22 dismissed the
company&#8217;s bid protest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We were relying on their investigation to provide
transparency into what has been a bidding process of
inconsistent, irregular and constantly changing requirements,&#8221;
Bill Boisture, chairman and chief executive officer of Hawker
Beechcraft Co., said in an e-mailed statement. We &#8220;continue to
believe that our exclusion from this important contract was made
without basis in process or fact,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Air Force, in a one-page memorandum, notified the
company on Nov. 1 that the AT-6 was excluded from consideration,
according to a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laura Sweeney, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined
to comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Hawker Beechcraft Defense Company LLC v. U.S.,
11-897, U.S. Court of Federal Claims (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On The Docket &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel&#8217;s February Antitrust Trial Canceled by U.S. Judge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal judge ruled that Intel Corp. (INTC) won&#8217;t face a
February trial in an antitrust lawsuit filed by New York state
officials who claim the chipmaker attempted to monopolize the
market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Leonard Stark in Wilmington, Delaware,
canceled Dec. 23 the Feb. 14 trial while lawyers for Intel, the
world&#8217;s largest semiconductor maker, and the state of New York
set up a schedule to hold arguments about whether the case
should be dismissed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York sued Santa Clara, California-based Intel in
November 2009, accusing it of using threats and billions of
dollars in illegal payments to pressure and unfairly persuade
computer manufacturers to use the company&#8217;s chips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Intel spokeswoman, Laura Anderson, didn&#8217;t return calls
seeking comment on the judge&#8217;s ruling. Danny Kanner, a spokesman
for New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, declined in an
e-mail to comment on the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel has battled allegations over the years that its
salespeople engaged in anticompetitive behavior. The company has
paid more than $2.7 billion to resolve antitrust litigation over
its chips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schneiderman&#8217;s predecessor, Andrew Cuomo, accused Intel of
engaging in illegal business practices to cement its dominance
of the market for microprocessor chips. Those tactics stifled
competition from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and artificially
inflated the prices consumers paid for computers, Cuomo, who is
now New York&#8217;s governor, said in the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stark already threw out some of the claims, including one
seeking triple damages for anticompetitive acts. The judge also
narrowed the scope of the case by saying New York can only focus
on computer purchases for a three-year period. State officials
had sought to use a six-year period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is State of New York v. Intel Corp., 09-cv-827,
U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Litigation Departments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Pays Marsal Firm Almost $500 Million to Manage Bankruptcy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) has paid almost half a
billion dollars in fees to restructuring firm Alvarez  Marsal
LLC during its bankruptcy, according to a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm, whose co-founder Bryan Marsal runs the defunct
investment bank, charged $496.2 million in fees for 38 1/2
months of &#8220;interim management,&#8221; including $8.6 million in
November, according to the filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan Dec. 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman, which has spent more than $1.5 billion on fees
since filing the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history in September
2008, paid $30.6 million to lawyers and managers in November,
according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lehman bankruptcy became America&#8217;s most costly in April
2010, when it topped the $757 million cost of energy trader
Enron Corp.&#8217;s three-year liquidation, according to data compiled
by Lynn LoPucki, a bankruptcy-law professor at the University of
California, Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fees earned by Weil, Gotshal  Manges LLP, based in New
York, total $366.6 million so far for acting as Lehman&#8217;s lead
bankruptcy law firm, including $8 million in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marsal, who bills Lehman hourly, has said he will start
distributing some cash to the defunct firm&#8217;s creditors by next
year, more than three years after the bankruptcy filing. He has
court approval for a $65 billion liquidation plan that would pay
the average Lehman creditor less than 18 cents on the dollar in
the next few years, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Beth Jinks and Danielle Kucera" date="Dec 29, 2011  4:36 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-12-29/amazon-shares-fall-as-goldman-sachs-says-retailer-may-miss-sales-estimates.html"><headline>Amazon May Miss Sales Estimates, Goldman Sachs Predicts</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) may miss fourth-
quarter sales estimates, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. predicted,
citing slower-than-expected e-commerce growth over the holidays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon&#8217;s revenue may rise 38 percent from a year earlier to
$17.9 billion, Heather Bellini, an analyst at Goldman Sachs,
said today in a report. That&#8217;s less the $18.2 billion average
analyst estimate (AMZN), according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bellini based her projection on data from ComScore Inc.,
which found that total e-commerce sales rose 15 percent in the
November-December holiday shopping season. While Amazon
historically outpaces the broader market by 23 percentage
points, that still doesn&#8217;t get the company to the 40 percent
growth analysts were expecting, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While the ComScore numbers are just one data point, which
does not capture international sales or breakout individual
companies&#8217; sales, taken alone they seem to suggest the potential
for downside risk,&#8221; Bellini said in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon&#8217;s bottom line also is suffering as the company steps
up spending on fulfillment centers and builds out Web services.
Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos said in October the company
may post a loss in the fourth quarter. Operating margin may
narrow to 0.84 percent in the period, from 3.66 percent a year
earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brighter Outlook &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray Cos. in
Minneapolis, gave a more upbeat view on fourth-quarter sales. He
said in a report that Amazon may beat estimates, boosted by
sales of its new Kindle Fire tablet. Amazon said earlier today
that it sold &#8220;well over&#8221; 1 million Kindles a week in December,
thanks to record demand fueled by the Kindle Fire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon shares were little changed at $173.86 at today in
New York. The stock has declined 3.4 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total online spending in the U.S. increased to $35.3
billion in the first 56 days of the holiday season, ComScore
said yesterday. The Reston, Virginia-based firm compiles Web-
traffic data from about 2 million consumers in 170 countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon&#8217;s top three sellers over the holidays were the
Kindle Fire and two electronic-book readers, the Kindle Touch
and the basic Kindle, the Seattle-based company said today. The
company also reported a rise in people giving electronic books
to others. Kindle book gifts climbed 175 percent from a year
earlier in the period from Nov. 25 to Christmas Day, Amazon
said, without providing precise sales data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Positive Momentum&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company began selling the $199 Kindle Fire on Nov. 14,
challenging Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPad with a tablet that costs less than
half as much. The Kindle Fire is outpacing more established
products from Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) and Barnes  Noble Inc.,
according to IHS Inc. Apple will remain the market leader,
shipping 18.6 million iPads in the fourth quarter, the research
firm estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Amazon is losing money on every Kindle Fire it sells,
according to IHS, the device helps encourage the ordering of
books, videos and other content. Colin Sebastian, an analyst at
Robert W. Baird  Co. in San Francisco, estimates that Amazon
will sell 5 million to 6 million Kindle Fires this quarter, as
does Munster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It shows positive momentum,&#8221; Sebastian said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leap Wireless International Inc. (LEAP) and
MetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS) may be takeover targets for bigger
rivals ATT Inc. (T) or T-Mobile USA after the larger companies&#8217; $39
billion merger plan collapsed, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pay-as-you-go carriers could be suitable &#8220;near-term&#8221;
sources of spectrum for a buyer, Phil Cusick, a JPMorgan analyst
in New York, said in a note to clients today. ATT cited a need
for more spectrum as a reason for its attempt to buy T-Mobile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leap&#8217;s spectrum and certain potential cash-flow benefits
following a takeover could be worth more than $13 a share to a
buyer, said Cusick, who reiterated his &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating (LEAP) on
both stocks. MetroPCS&#8217;s airwaves and some potential cash-flow
benefits could be worth more than $6 a share, the analyst said.
Leap&#8217;s spectrum alone is worth $1.9 billion and MetroPCS&#8217;s
airwaves $2.6 billion, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a &#8220;strong likelihood&#8221; that regulators would
approve the purchase of San Diego-based Leap or Richardson,
Texas-based MetroPCS by a larger national carrier, Cusick said.
Dallas-based ATT abandoned its nine-month campaign to acquire
T-Mobile this month amid opposition from regulators, which said
the combination would reduce competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leap advanced 4.3 percent to $8.49 at the close in New
York. MetroPCS rose 2.5 percent to $8.24. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Siegel, a spokesman for ATT, and Greg Lund, a
spokesman for Leap, declined to comment. Andreas Fuchs, a
spokesman for T-Mobile&#8217;s parent, Bonn-based Deutsche Telekom,
wasn&#8217;t available to comment. Calls to MetroPCS representatives
weren&#8217;t returned. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world&#8217;s largest computer-services company, received a
patent on a method of paying people to eat more healthily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patent 8,078,492, issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office Dec. 13, covers a computer system that can detect a
consumable item and provide the consumer with an electronic
monetary incentive based on the item and the consumer&#8217;s health
history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system could also include exercise records for the
individual and recipes for healthy items, according to the
patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent has taken more than 10 years to be issued.
Armonk, New York-based IBM applied for the patent in October
2001, according to the database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LVMH Sues Over Use of Fake Vuitton Luggage in &#8216;Hangover&#8217; Film &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) sued Time Warner Inc. (TWX)&#8217;s
Warner Brothers Entertainment unit for trademark infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit, filed Dec. 22 in federal court in New York, is
related to Warner&#8217;s &#8220;The Hangover: Part II&#8221; movie. The French
luxury-goods maker claims that a travel bag used in the film and
referred to as a genuine piece of Louis Vuitton luggage is a
fake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By referring to the fake as a Louis Vuitton bag, Warner
Brothers is &#8220;explicitly misleading the public about the
source&#8221; of the counterfeit product, Vuitton said in its
pleadings. While the fake uses the color scheme of genuine
Vuitton bags, it lacks the LV trademark, the company said in its
pleadings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bag used in the movie is actually from a company
against which Vuitton brought an action before the U.S.
International Trade Commission, a body with the power to ban the
import of infringing items, the luxury-goods company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vuitton does authorize product placement in movies, only
with its permission and only with genuine products, according to
court papers. Warner is accused of stepping outside the general
practice in the movie industry of clearing the use of a branded
product with the brand owner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to seeking an order barring the advertising,
promotion and distribution of the film containing any scenes
with the allegedly infringing bag, Vuitton asked the court to
order the destruction of all copies of the film that contain
images of the counterfeit bag and represent it as a genuine
Louis Vuitton product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Vuitton asked for an award of Warner
Brother&#8217;s profits related to its alleged false designation or
origin, money damages, litigation costs and attorney fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&#8217;t the first time the film has been the target of
an infringement suit. In April, the tattoo artist who created
Mike Tyson&#8217;s distinctive tattoo sued over the use of that design
in the film. That case settled in June for undisclosed terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That case was Whitmill v. Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.,
4:11-cv-00752-DCP, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Missouri (St. Louis). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new case, Vuitton is represented by Theodore C. Max
of Los Angeles-based Sheppard Mullin Richter  Hampton LLP (1215L), and
Robert E. Shapiro, Wendi E. Sloane and Vito S. Solitro of
Chicago&#8217;s Barack Ferrazzano Kirschbaum  Nagelberg LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Louis Vuitton Malletier SA v. Warner Bros.
Entertainment Inc., 1:11-cv-09436-ALC, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese Police Say China Source of Most Counterfeit Goods &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s National Police Agency has identified almost 450
websites advertising in the Japanese language counterfeit
fashion items such as handbags, with most of them originating in
China, the Mainichi Daily News reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the sites use such phrases as &#8220;It&#8217;s a super copy -
- looks just like the original,&#8221; according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the police have shut down 28 websites in Japan, 14 of
them reappeared soon after having changed from domestic servers
to overseas, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before 2006, most of the fake fashion items originated in
Korea. China now leads, producing 92 percent of all seized
counterfeit items in 2010, according to Mainichi News. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singapore Press Says Yahoo! &#8216;Deliberately&#8217; Committed Plagiarism &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singapore Press Holdings Ltd. (SPH), embroiled in a legal tussle
with Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) as both accused each other of copyright
infringement, said the Internet company &#8220;deliberately&#8221;
reproduced its news content without permission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Yahoo had over an extended period of time consistently
and deliberately committed plagiarism by substantially
reproducing the words and expressions used in SPH&#8217;s articles
without permission,&#8221; Singapore Press said in a statement to the
stock exchange yesterday. Yahoo was &#8220;free-riding&#8221; on the
newspaper publisher to boost its website page views and
advertising revenue, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singapore Press sued Yahoo&#8217;s Southeast Asia unit Nov. 18,
claiming the company reproduced 23 articles from newspapers
including the Straits Times from November 2010 to October 2011
without authorization. On Dec. 13, Yahoo denied breaching
copyright laws and counter-sued Singapore Press for wrongly
using its images and articles on a website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;SPH is determined to pursue this suit vigorously and to
protect its copyrighted works,&#8221; the newspaper publisher said
after filing its defense to the Singapore High Court yesterday
in response to Yahoo&#8217;s countersuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo said in a defense filed to the Singapore court Dec.
13 the articles that Singapore Press claimed were reproduced
without authorization were insubstantial and insignificant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is an important public interest in respect of the
right of the public to be informed of current events in
Singapore,&#8221; the Sunnyvale, California-based Internet company
said. &#8220;Copyright law does not protect facts and information.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo approached Singapore Press in April 2009 for a
license to reproduce news content, and negotiations between the
two companies broke down last year, according to the publisher&#8217;s
lawsuit. The Internet company relied on Singapore Press&#8217;s
articles to provide content on its website to raise traffic and
build readership without having to expend financial resources,
according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These acts of infringement were committed by Yahoo to
direct and maximize traffic to its website in order to drive up
its page views and advertising revenue,&#8221; Singapore Press said
today. &#8220;This was not done for the public interest, as claimed
by Yahoo, but instead in furtherance of its own vested financial
interest.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singapore Press deliberately kept silent until a letter
from its lawyers Nov. 4, causing Yahoo to continue with the
alleged infringement for a year as it believed the publisher had
no complaints, according to the Internet company&#8217;s filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Singapore Press Holdings Ltd. v Yahoo!
Southeast Asia Ltd., S831/2011, Singapore High Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese Court Upholds Acquittal of Software Developer &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s highest court upheld a lower court&#8217;s ruling
clearing the developer of the Winny file-sharing software of
enabling criminal copyright infringement, the Mainichi News
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court said the users are the ones who decide whether to
use the program legally or illegally, according to the
newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isamu Kaneko, 41, was first accused of aiding criminal
infringement in 2003 and was found guilty in 2006 and fined 1.5
million yen ($13,000), Mainichi News reported. The guilty
verdict was reversed by an intermediate court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaneko&#8217;s case was the first in Japan to test the liability
of a software developer for illegal use of the file-sharing
software he created, according to Mainichi News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Korean Music Companies Win Damages in U.S. Court Against Aussie &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal court in San Jose, California, entered a $645,000
judgment against an Australian defendant in a copyright
infringement suit brought by a group of Korean music companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six Korean music companies sued Kenny Tran, the operator of
the 1honeyjoo.com and 1honedew.com websites, for copyright
infringement in March 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They accused Tran, an Australian defendant, of operating
websites to disseminate unauthorized copies of their music,
calling him &#8220;one of the biggest illegal uploaders and free
download link providers of Korean music in the world.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They filed court documents in March attesting that Tran had
properly been served with a copy of the complaint. Tran has
never responded to the filing, according to the case docket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her order granting the music companies a default
judgment against Tran, U.S. District Judge Lucy H. Koh addressed
the issue of whether her court was an appropriate forum for a
dispute between the two foreign defendants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said that Tran used California companies -- including
Facebook Inc., Google Inc.&#8217;s YouTube and Twitter Inc. -- to
advertise and direct people to his websites, and that his sites
encouraged Californians to download music without authorization.
She also noted that Tran had failed to come forward and ask for
an alternative forum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She found her court to be appropriate and issued a
permanent order barring Tran from further infringement of the
companies&#8217; copyrights, and awarded the companies the $645,000 in
damages they requested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is DFSB Kollective Vo. Ltd. v. Tran, 5:11-
cv-01049-LHK, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
California (San Jose). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bahamas Copyright Fund to Get Royalty-Payout Regulations &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Bahamas Copyright Royalty Fund hasn&#8217;t paid
performers any royalties in its 11 years of existence, the
situation is about to change with the establishment of
regulations governing payment rates, the Bahamas Tribune
newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bahamas Attorney General&#8217;s Office has appointed an IP
specialist to develop the regulations and rates so the Copyright
Royalties Tribunal could begin to make payments from the fund,
according to the Tribune. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund was established in 2000 to provide payments to
television performers and artists by Cable Bahamas, the
newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The London-based Performing Rights Society for Music, which
represents Bahamian music creators and rights holders, sent the
chairman of the tribunal a letter raising concerns about the
lack of payouts from the fund, according to the Tribune. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A unit of Synthes Inc., the world&#8217;s largest maker of bone-
related medical devices, accused Stryker Corp. in a lawsuit of
raiding its San Francisco sales force and using confidential
information from former employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stryker seeks to obtain &#8220;an improper competitive
advantage&#8221; in the industry for medical implants and instruments
used in spinal surgery, Synthes USA Sales LLC said in the
complaint filed yesterday in federal court in Philadelphia.
Synthes also accused three former sales employees of
misappropriating trade secrets and breaching their contractual
and fiduciary obligations to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former employees resigned from Synthes from August to
early October, according to the complaint. They immediately
began working for Stryker, one of the company&#8217;s direct
competitors, and are soliciting former customers, according to
the court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives of Kalamazoo, Michigan-based Stryker didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to an e-mail and phone message at the
company headquarters seeking comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though all three employees live and work in
California, the suit alleged the three ex-employees violated
Pennsylvania trade-secrets law rather than California&#8217;s. Courts
in California have tended to look less kindly than those in
other states on employment contracts that limit future
employment in the same industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson  Johnson agreed to buy Synthes, based in West
Chester, Pennsylvania, in April for $21.3 billion to become the
leader in the $5.5 billion market for devices to treat trauma
victims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Synthes USA Sales LLC v. Stryker Corp., 2:11-
cv-07876-TJS, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Pennsylvania (Philadelphia). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s Prevnar 13 vaccine for
a bacterial infection that causes pneumonia won approval for use
in adults 50 and older, a population that may add almost $2
billion to sales in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration cleared the shot that will
compete with Merck  Co. (MRK)&#8217;s vaccine, which was approved almost 30
years ago, the agency said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA weighed approval on the condition New York-based
Pfizer studies the vaccine further to prove it protects against
pneumococcal pneumonia. About 300,000 U.S. adults 50 and older
are hospitalized with the infections each year, said Karen Midthun, director of FDA&#8217;s Center for Biologics Evaluation and
Research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pneumococcal disease is a substantial cause of illness
and death,&#8221; Midthun said in the statement. &#8220;Today&#8217;s approval
provides an additional vaccine for preventing pneumococcal
pneumonia and invasive disease in this age group.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prevnar 13, approved in the U.S. last year for children 6
weeks to 5 years old, generated (PFE) $2.82 billion the first nine
months of 2011, according to the regulatory filings from Pfizer,
the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker. The vaccine may generate $5.9
billion by 2015, with adult use contributing $1.8 billion, said
Catherine Arnold, an analyst with Credit Suisse Group AG in New
York, in a note to investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The FDA approval of Prevnar 13 for these adults offers
the potential to contribute to the health of millions of aging
Americans,&#8221; Ian Read, Pfizer&#8217;s chairman and chief executive
officer, said today in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safety Results &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An FDA staff report released Nov. 14 determined the vaccine
was safe and effective in adults who received Pneumovax 23 from
Whitehouse Station, New Jersey-based Merck and in those never
immunized. Pfizer started an 85,000-subject trial in the
Netherlands to confirm the vaccine&#8217;s effectiveness in staving
off pneumococcal pneumonia, the agency said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer hasn&#8217;t determined how long the shot will last and is
studying a five-year duration as part of the Netherlands trial,
said Peter Paradiso, of Pfizer&#8217;s vaccine development unit, in an
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer declined less than 1 percent to $21.64 at the close
in New York. The shares gained 24 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck&#8217;s Pneumovax 23 had $276 million in sales (MRK) in the first
nine months of this year, according to company filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurance coverage for Prevnar 13 will depend on whether
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#8217;s vaccines panel
recommends Pfizer&#8217;s shot for those 50 and older. The 2010 health
law requires coverage of vaccines recommended by the panel
without a co-payment or deductible cost to patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck&#8217;s vaccine is recommended for people 65 and older and
for people 2 years and older at high risk for pneumonia, such as
those with sickle cell disease, HIV infection and other
conditions that compromise the immune system, according to the
CDC. It is also recommended for adults 19 to 64 who smoke, have
asthma or live in nursing homes or long-term care facilities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s oil regulator fined Chevron
Corp. (CVX) for the third time for not properly managing an offshore
oil field that leaked last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron didn&#8217;t comply with the development plan for the
Frade oil field off the coast of Brazil, the Agencia Nacional do
Petroleo, Gas Natural e Biocombustiveis, known as ANP, said on
its website today. The company didn&#8217;t have the proper measures
in place to protect the reservoir at a well that leaked about
3,000 barrels of oil, the ANP said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron will analyze the allegations cited in the ANP&#8217;s
notification, Scott Walker, a spokesman for the San Ramon,
California-based company, said in an e-mail. Chevron followed
the oil industry&#8217;s best practices and acted &#8220;within the plan of
development approved by ANP,&#8221; Walker said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ANP didn&#8217;t specify the amount of the fine. The
regulator took action against Chevron in November for not
complying with a plan to close down the well and not providing
complete videos of the oil spill. Each of the first two fines
may be as much as 50 million reais ($26 million,) Magda Chambriard, a director at the ANP, said Nov 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANP officials weren&#8217;t available for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) must pay
about $750 million to Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), a tenth of what the
U.S. company is seeking, for assets nationalized by Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez in 2007, according to two people with
knowledge of the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Chamber of Commerce in New York, an
international arbitration court, gave a &#8220;favorable&#8221; ruling to
Venezuela&#8217;s state oil company, a company spokesman said today.
The World Bank&#8217;s International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes, or ICSID, is also due to rule on the claim
in a suit filed against the Venezuelan government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people, who declined to be identified because they&#8217;re
not authorized to speak about the case publicly, said the
decision was handed down late this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chavez, who has nationalized assets in the energy, metals,
cement and telecommunications industries, faces about 20
arbitration cases at the ICSID, according to the Washington-
based center&#8217;s website. Venezuelan Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez
said in September that the country was willing to pay Exxon $1
billion after Carlos Escarra, the country&#8217;s prosecutor general,
told reporters that the two companies were negotiating a
settlement of about $6 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
