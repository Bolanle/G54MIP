<p>The good thing about having back
surgery if you''re an Olympic athlete, says U.S. water polo
player Peter Hudnut, is it gives you time to be an intern. </p>
<p>One of 11 members of the American squad returning to the
Olympics after winning a silver medal in Beijing, Hudnut will
join Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s private wealth management
division following the London Games, which end Aug. 12. </p>
<p>The job at Goldman may never have happened if a back
injury, multiple fractures in two vertebrae and shoulder
problems hadn''t sidelined the 32-year-old Stanford University
graduate before the 2004 Games in Athens. While surgery and
months of rehabilitation hampered his athletic career, they gave
him time to get work experience, Hudnut said in an interview at
London''s Athletes Village. </p>
<p>I was somewhat lucky in that I had so many injuries and
every time I had a surgery it would put me out for a handful of
months, the 6-foot-5 central defender said. I was lucky
enough to get some internships -- some through friends, some on
my own -- and that helped guide me where I wanted to go. </p>
<p>Positions at CIM Group, Bank of New York Mellon Corp. and
Los Angeles developer Ratkovich Co., as well as his 2011
Stanford business degree, awakened an interest in finance, he
said. Twenty-eight interviews with Goldman left him feeling he''d
found a firm where he could both learn and use the skills
gleaned from years of strenuous training. </p>
<h2>Desire, Discipline </h2>
<p>Desire, discipline and all the things I''ve used in water
polo are very applicable to finance, Hudnut said. The focus
and drive, the ability to communicate effectively with many
different personality types and many different situations, the
ability to adapt and be flexible; these are all traits that team
sport, especially at this level, demand. </p>
<p>The U.S. squad water polo team trained in Thousand Oaks,
California, for almost a year, giving up professional positions
on teams overseas, Hudnut said. The team spent between five and
seven hours in meetings, five days a week. They watched video,
lifted weights and practiced in the pool. The daily sessions
averaged seven to eight hour as the Olympics neared. </p>
<p>Peter in Beijing was a really important part of the glue
that kept the team together, coach Terry Schroeder said in an
interview after the U.S. beat Britain 13-7 on Aug. 2. As he
plays a bit more and feels comfortable with his playing, he''s
taken on that role more and more again and it''s really important
to the team. </p>
<p>The preliminary round finishes today with the U.S. playing
Hungary, the 2008 champions. The Americans have won three of
their four early stage matches. </p>
<h2>Early Dreams </h2>
<p>Hudnut was introduced to water polo as a 10-year-old by
Richard Corso, the assistant coach of the 1984 U.S. team. </p>
<p>I was this huge uncoordinated kid and he came and handed
me this baby blue bag and on one side it had the Olympic rings
and on the other side it said USA, Hudnut said, adding that he
could barely swim at the time. Inside was a water polo ball, a
little suit and a water polo hat. </p>
<p>Almost 6 feet tall (1.82 meters) at 12, Hudnut began
playing against boys two and three years older than himself. In
1992, Corso became the head coach for the U.S. national team. </p>
<p>He would drive me down with him to national team
practice, so I would watch the guys and talk to some of the
heroes of that time about what Olympics meant to them, he
said. That really lit that fire. </p>
<h2>Better Than Beijing </h2>
<p>Ranked ninth in the run-up to the Beijing Games, the U.S.
beat Serbia in the semifinals before losing 14-10 in the gold
medal match against Hungary. It was America''s first medal in
water polo in 20 years. The 2012 squad is more tightly knit and
tactically and physically equal to the best teams, Hudnut said. </p>
<p>I truly believe that this is the first time in a number
of Olympics that any of the top seven teams could potentially
win, he said, adding that playing in professional leagues in
Europe has boosted the ability of both American and Australian
players. The U.S. last won a gold medal in water polo in 1904. </p>
<p>Winning silvers in men''s and women''s water polo in Beijing
was the first time a country walked away with two medals in the
event at a single Olympics, Bill Smith, USA Water Polo secretary
and finance committee chairman and the president of Greenwich,
Connecticut-based Renaissance Capital LLC, said in a telephone
interview. </p>
<p>Whether he wins a second medal, Hudnut is looking forward
to the next stage of his life. </p>
<p>I know it''s going to be a tough year and that''s one of
the things that inspires me, Hudnut said. From a challenge
perspective, my desire to succeed and do well gets me up in the
morning. I hope that Goldman is a true career path for me. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) faulted a plan
by the trustee liquidating Peregrine Financial Group Inc. to
request customer documents directly from Chief Executive Officer
James Dimon, saying it was inefficient and unnecessary. </p>
<p>Trustee Ira Bodenstein asked a judge for authority to
subpoena JPMorgan and nine other financial institutions for
customer documents as part of what he called a routine
examination of the defunct futures brokerage''s records, serving
papers directly on their CEOs. JPMorgan told the judge it had
instead authorized its lawyers to accept the trustee''s requests
on behalf of Dimon. </p>
<p>Although styled as a routine'' motion under this court''s
local rules, certain of the proposed terms and conditions upon
which the trustee seeks to conduct the proposed examinations are
anything but routine,'' the bank said in a filing in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Chicago today. </p>
<p>The trustee told the judge last month he needs access to
customer documents to identify abnormalities in the
company''s records. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
has accused Peregrine founder Russell Wasendorf Sr. of
misappropriating more than $200 million of customer funds. </p>
<h2>Account Applications </h2>
<p>Subpoenas will also go to Citigroup Inc. (C), U.S. Bank, Bank
of New York Mellon Corp. (BK), First Premier Bank, Commerzbank AG,
Royal Bank of Scotland Plc, Jefferies Bache LLC, Morgan Stanley (MS)
and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the trustee said. All maintained
account applications, authorization forms, agreements,
statements, wire transfers, canceled checks, deposit slips and
correspondence, he said. </p>
<p>Bodenstein''s proposal to bar the banks from recovering the
costs of providing the documents also is a departure from the
norm, JPMorgan said. </p>
<p>It is an exceptional and impermissible departure from the
federal rules and the debtor''s own contractual undertakings,
it said. </p>
<p>Peregrine''s July 10 bankruptcy, cutting off customers''
access to their accounts, came less than a year after the
failure of MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ), whose clients are still
missing money. In district court in Chicago, a receiver is
finding and securing Wasendorf''s assets on request of the CFTC,
which is probing the missing customer money, as is the Justice
Department. </p>
<h2>Personal Investments </h2>
<p>Wasendorf may have funded his personal investments with
Peregrine brokerage money, the receiver has said. </p>
<p>In its bankruptcy petition, Cedar Falls, Iowa-based
Peregrine listed more than $500 million in assets and more than
$100 million in liabilities. </p>
<p>The criminal case is U.S. v. Wasendorf, 12-mj-131, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of Iowa (Cedar Rapids). The
bankruptcy case is Peregrine Financial Group Inc., 12-27488,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago).
The regulatory case is U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
v. Peregrine Financial Group Inc., 12-cv-05383, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago). </p>

<p>Daniel Pinto, co-head of JPMorgan
Chase  Co.''s (JPM) newly expanded corporate and investment bank
division, holds $19.6 million of restricted and unrestricted
stock. </p>
<p>Pinto, 49, has $8.7 million of the New York-based bank''s
shares directly and through a trust, as well as $10.9 million in
restricted-stock units that vest in installments through 2015,
according to a filing today to the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. </p>
<p>Pinto was elevated to run the division with Mike Cavanagh
as part of a senior-management shakeup last month, following at
least $5.8 billion in losses on a London unit''s trades. The pair
replaced Jes Staley, who gave up day-to-day operational duties
as head of the investment bank to become chairman of the
expanded unit. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), which had the largest
trading-revenue drop among major U.S. banks last quarter, lost
money in that business on 15 days in the period, up from eight
days a year earlier. </p>
<p>The firm''s traders generated more than $100 million on
three days in the period, compared with seven days in the second
quarter of 2011, the New York-based company said today in a
regulatory filing. None of the daily losses exceeded the firm''s
value-at-risk, a measure of how much the bank estimates it could
lose on 95 percent of days. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley had a 48 percent year-over-year decrease in
trading revenue, excluding accounting gains, led by a 60 percent
drop in fixed-income revenue. Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, 54, said last month that some clients shied away from
doing business with the bank as they waited to see whether
Moody''s Investors Service would cut the firm''s credit rating two
or three grades. Moody''s lowered the assessment two levels in
June. </p>
<p>Trading revenue accounted for 40 percent of the firm''s
total in 2011. Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, 54, said
last month he will shrink the fixed-income trading business to
free up capital. He plans to reduce so-called risk-weighted
assets in the unit by 30 percent from the third quarter of 2011
through the end of 2014. </p>
<p>Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the second-largest U.S. lender, said
in a filing last week that it recorded trading losses on three
days in the quarter, with the largest loss at $11 million. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) said accusations
of market manipulation by California''s electric-grid operator
are irrelevant and unproven as the parties spar over
payments for power from 2009 to 2011. </p>
<p>The California Independent System Operator, which oversees
the wholesale power market in the state, has said the payments
were excessive and the result of bidding behavior and took the
case to the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. JPMorgan
said the California operator reached conclusions before FERC
completes its investigation. </p>
<p>The state operator cannot muster any meaningful,
substantive responses to the legal arguments in the case,
according to an Aug. 3 filing made by JPMorgan. Therefore it
resorts to irrelevant and unproven allegations about the
bidding. </p>
<p>FERC Chairman Jon Wellinghoff said in March that the agency
will be vigorous in seeking to stop companies from manipulating
electricity markets, after the agency reached a record $245
million settlement with Constellation Energy Group Inc. for
trading practices in New York and New England. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s role was disclosed when the agency, responding
to a complaint from the state, asked a federal judge in
Washington to retrieve some of JPMorgan''s e-mails as part of the
investigation. JPMorgan has said it acted within the law in its
bidding for California power. </p>
<p>FERC doesn''t have any deadline for ruling on California''s
request, agency''s spokesman Craig Cano said by phone today. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) were among banks that pledged to improve how they
guard client information in Japan amid an insider trading
scandal that toppled Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)''s top two executives. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs plans to train employees on ethics from
November through February, and last month began programs on
maintaining confidentiality, the New York-based bank said in a
statement on its website yesterday. JPMorgan plans to increase
compliance staff in Japan and boost monitoring of communication
between employees to avoid leaks, it said in a statement. </p>
<p>The securities firms are trying to curb the fallout after
the financial watchdog''s investigation arm concluded that staff
at three firms including Nomura leaked information ahead of
clients'' share sales in 2010, eroding their credibility. The
Financial Services Agency last month asked 12 investment banks
to report on how they manage the data. </p>
<p>You can''t restore confidence overnight, said Takao Saga, a professor at Waseda University in Tokyo and commissioner
at the Japan Securities Research Institute. Whether training
or monitoring will work remains to be seen, as employees have
been leaking inside information knowing that they may be
breaching rules. </p>
<p>Nomura and Daiwa also submitted reports pledging to improve
how they manage corporate information, as did Bank of America
Corp. (BAC)''s Merrill Lynch, UBS AG and Deutsche Bank AG. (DBK) The
securities watchdog had concluded that staff at Daiwa and
JPMorgan also tipped traders ahead of deals. </p>
<h2>Dismissal Risk </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs is telling staff they may be fired if they
leak inside information, Hiroko Matsumoto, a Tokyo-based
spokeswoman, said yesterday. The Wall Street firm employed about
850 staff at its Japanese brokerage unit as of March 31. </p>
<p>Getting employees to understand that rule breaches mean
they will lose jobs or end their careers will have an important
influence, Saga said. </p>
<p>Japan''s FSA ordered Nomura on Aug. 3 to improve its
business after it failed to prevent staff from providing tips to
traders on at least three share sales in 2010. The scandal led
to Koji Nagai replacing Kenichi Watanabe as chief executive
officer on Aug. 1, a month after the firm released a report
revealing that equity sales staff appeared to be willing to do
anything to meet revenue targets. Atsushi Yoshikawa replaced
Takumi Shibata as chief operating officer. </p>
<h2>Brokerages Fall </h2>
<p>The 19-stock Topix Securities and Commodity Futures Index
rose 1.2 percent at 10 a.m. in Tokyo. The gauge has fallen 25
percent since the first case of leaks was revealed on March 21,
more than the benchmark Topix Index (TPX)''s 12 percent drop. </p>
<p>Being embroiled in the country''s information-leaking cases
has also led to lost business as companies and government
agencies distance themselves from tainted firms. Nomura was
removed from a lead role Japan Airlines Co.''s $8.5 billion
initial public offering, people with knowledge of the situation
said on July 18. It also lost its rank as Japan''s No. 1 bond
underwriter last month as issuers dropped the bank. </p>
<p>Daiwa also lost at least one bond deal, when Kawasaki Heavy
Industries Ltd. (7012) excluded it from managing a sale on July 2. </p>
<p>Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co., a Tokyo-based
brokerage venture between Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306)
and Morgan Stanley, said yesterday it also plans to improve
compliance measures as part of the FSA review. The brokerage
will tighten oversight of costs related to entertaining clients
and is considering issuing recordable mobile phones to some
staff in its sales and research divisions, it said yesterday in
a statement on its website. </p>
<h2>Pay Cuts </h2>
<p>Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411), Japan''s third-biggest bank by
market value, said it will strengthen oversight of information
between departments at its investment banking unit and more
closely monitor e-mails. </p>
<p>Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316)''s SMBC Nikko
Securities Inc. unit will increase the liability of employees
who breach compliance rules, it said yesterday on its website.
SMBC Nikko President Eiji Watanabe and Chairman Shigenobu Aikyo
will have their pay cut by 30 percent for four months, the
company said, following the June arrest of a former executive on
suspicion of aiding insider trading. </p>
<p>Citigroup Inc. (C)''s local brokerage unit said it plans to
improve information safeguards by clarifying policies on how it
manages corporate information. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, may buy back as much as 11 percent
of current shares outstanding by the end of 2013, according to
International Strategy  Investment Group Inc. </p>
<p>That target could be reached if the New York-based company
speeds the reduction of risk-weighted assets and the Federal
Reserve approves the repurchase program, Edward Najarian, an
analyst at ISI, wrote in a research note today. Otherwise, ISI
estimates Goldman Sachs will buy back 6 percent of fully diluted
shares outstanding, or about 31 million shares, over the next
six quarters. </p>
<p>The bank is unlikely to earn a sustainable return on
tangible common equity above 10 percent between 2012 and 2014
and Goldman Sachs, therefore, is fairly valued at between 80
percent and 90 percent of tangible book value, according to the
note. The shares are likely to remain in a range of $95 to $120,
wrote Najarian, who has a hold rating on the stock. </p>
<p>We don''t see tremendous upside from its current stock
price and remain wary of the challenging macro backdrop as well
as Goldman''s volatile earnings, Najarian wrote. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs climbed 1.2 percent to $103.24 in New York
today and has advanced 14 percent this year. The shares trade at
83 percent of tangible book value, an estimate of how much the
firm would fetch in a liquidation. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) won approval of a $4.8
million accord with the U.S. over claims it helped manipulate
electricity prices, in what the Justice Department called its
first effort to get disgorgement from a financial firm that used
derivatives to aid anticompetitive behavior. </p>
<p>In accepting the agreement, U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan turned aside complaints from a not-for-
profit organization that Morgan Stanley didn''t admit wrongdoing.
Pauley, citing the Justice Department, said the case marks the
first time the government filed an antitrust suit against a
financial firm involving derivative agreements. </p>
<p>Disgorgement of $4.8 million is a relatively mild
sanction, Pauley wrote. But despite this court''s misgivings,
the government''s decision to settle for less than full damages
is entitled to judicial deference, particularly in view of the
novelty of the government''s theory. </p>
<p>Pauley rejected objections by AARP, a not-for-profit that
advocates for people 50 and older, and from New York''s Public
Service Commission. Critics of the settlement sought an
admission of wrongdoing by Morgan Stanley and said the New York-
based firm should have been required to pay the full $21.6
million it earned to settle claims it aided efforts by Brooklyn,
New York-based KeySpan Corp. to manipulate electricity prices. </p>
<h2>Earlier Ruling </h2>
<p>An admission of liability is not a prerequisite for
judicial approval of an agency settlement, Pauley said, citing
a recent ruling by a federal appeals court in a case involving
Citigroup Inc. </p>
<p>Mary Claire Delaney, a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley,
declined to comment on the judge''s approval of the settlement. </p>
<p>This settlement should send a message to the financial
services community that the antitrust division will vigorously
pursue anyone who engages in anticompetitive conduct in the
derivatives industry, Gina Talamona, a Justice Department
spokeswoman, said in an e-mail statement. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Morgan Stanley, 11-6875, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc., the world''s biggest
drugmaker, agreed to pay $60.2 million to settle foreign bribery
cases it brought to U.S. authorities involving alleged payments
paid by employees and agents of subsidiaries. </p>
<p>Pfizer entered into two agreements with the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the New York-based drugmaker reached a
deferred prosecution accord with the Department of Justice,
according to filings today in federal court in Washington. </p>
<p>U.S. law enforcement authorities have been probing
drugmakers including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd,
AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) and GlaxoSmithKline
Plc (GSK) for possibly breaking an overseas anti-bribery law that bars
employees or their agents from paying bribes to foreign
government officials to obtain or retain business. Today''s
settlements stem from payments and gifts Pfizer said its foreign
units made to government-employed doctors and workers in eastern
Europe, China and the Middle East, according to the filings. </p>
<p>These improper payments were variously made to influence
regulatory and formulary approvals, purchase decisions,
prescription decisions, and to clear customs, according to a
complaint filed by the SEC. </p>
<h2>Inaccurate Books </h2>
<p>The SEC said the payoffs were made without the knowledge
or approval of officers or employees of Pfizer, but the
inaccurate books and records of Pfizer subsidiaries were
consolidated in the financial reports of Pfizer. </p>
<p>Pfizer alerted U.S. authorities in 2004 after probing the
claims. More payments were found when the drugmaker bought its
Wyeth unit in 2009. </p>
<p>The actions which led to this resolution were
disappointing, but the openness and speed with which Pfizer
voluntarily disclosed and addressed them reflects our true
culture and the real value we place on integrity and meeting
commitments, Amy Schulman, Pfizer''s general counsel, said in
an e-mailed statement. We expect every colleague across Pfizer
to adhere to the highest standards of conduct. </p>
<p>Pfizer shares fell 2.1 percent to $23.74 at the close of
New York trading. </p>
<p>The Justice Department charged the Pfizer HCP Corp. unit
with two criminal counts, conspiracy to violate the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act and a violation of the FCPA''s anti-bribery
provisions. Prosecutors agreed to defer prosecution and drop the
charges after two years if Pfizer continues to cooperate and
take remedial steps. The settlements must be approved by a
federal judge. </p>
<h2>Criminal Fine </h2>
<p>Prosecutors agreed to a criminal fine of $15 million, a 34
percent reduction, because of the company''s extraordinary
cooperation after voluntarily disclosing the payments, and its
extraordinary and ongoing remediation. </p>
<p>Pfizer disclosed in regulatory filings last year that it
had reached agreements in principle with the Justice Department
and the SEC to resolve matters concerning potentially improper
payments made by the company outside the U.S., without
specifically citing the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. </p>
<p>Pfizer has been voluntarily cooperating with government
investigators since 2004, the company said. Governments in other
countries also are investigating potentially improper payments,
Pfizer said in the filings. </p>
<h2>Eight Countries </h2>
<p>The settlements announced today include Pfizer operations
in eight countries: Bulgaria, Croatia, Kazakhstan, Russia,
Italy, China, the Czech Republic and Serbia. The Wyeth
settlement, over its nutrition business, was for China,
Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. </p>
<p>Pfizer agreed for two years to submit reports to the SEC on
the company''s anticorruption efforts and the status of
implementing compliance measures, according to court filings.
The company won''t be subject to direct monitoring by the Justice
Department of the SEC, though. </p>
<p>Wyeth agreed to settle without admitting or denying the
bribery allegations, according to a court filing by Wyeth vice
president, Bradley Lerman. </p>
<p>In Bulgaria, local representatives spent $28,000 to invite
government doctors on incentive trips to Greece, as a reward
for the physicians who were the biggest prescribers of Pfizer''s
products, Pfizer admitted according to the Justice Department
filing. They also paid $17,000 to send doctors to medical
conferences, again in exchange for commitments to prescribe
Pfizer drugs. </p>
<h2>Croatian Doctor </h2>
<p>In Croatia, the unit there had used a consulting agreement
with a government doctor to help influence which drugs were
allowed to be sold in the country, paying the physician in cash
and travel expenses, Pfizer admitted. </p>
<p>Pfizer also admitted to what was called the hospital
program, in Russia, where doctors were given a 5 percent kick-
back on certain drugs prescribed. </p>
<p>Pfizer Russia used the Hospital Program to make cash
payments to individual government healthcare professionals to
corruptly reward past purchases and prescriptions of Pfizer
products, and to corruptly induce future purchases and
prescriptions, the Justice Department said in the filing.
Pfizer''s Russian unit also used intermediary companies to pay
off doctors and government officials, the company admitted. </p>
<h2>Illegal Payments </h2>
<p>The 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act makes payments to
foreign officials to win business illegal. It was created after
a SEC investigation in the 1970s found that 400 U.S. companies
had paid $300 million in bribes abroad, according to the Justice
Department. </p>
<p>Bristol-Myers, based in New York, said April 26 it received
a subpoena in March from the SEC and the company is cooperating. </p>
<p>Glaxo said in its 2010 and 2011 annual reports that the SEC
and the Justice Department were conducting an industry-wide
investigation into whether drug companies bribed officials in

<p>A fire at Chevron Corp. (CVX)''s Richmond
oil refinery in California pushed gasoline prices higher today
as it disrupted fuel output at the state''s third-largest crude-
processing plant. </p>
<p>Chevron''s 240,000-barrel-a-day refinery shut its only crude
unit after the fire yesterday, Heather Kulp, a Richmond-based
spokeswoman for Chevron, said today. The fire is out, she said,
and the plant is maintaining a small controlled burn at the
crude unit to relieve pressure. Other units are operating at
unknown levels, Kulp said. </p>
<p>California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in San Francisco
gained 23 cents to a premium of 28.5 cents a gallon against
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 12:42 p.m.
East Coast time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That''s
the highest level for Carbob in the Bay Area since May 29 and
the largest single-day increase since Bloomberg began compiling
spot prices in November 2007. </p>
<p>These increases will be passed along to retail pumps at
California and gas stations as far north as Seattle, Bob van der Valk, a petroleum industry analyst in Terry, Montana, said
in an e-mail. He said BP Plc (BP/)''s Cherry Point refinery in
Washington took four months to reach full operation after a fire
in February. </p>
<h2>No Estimate </h2>
<p>Kulp said the refinery doesn''t have a restart estimate for
the No. 4 crude unit, which has a daily throughput capacity of
257,200 barrels a day, according to an Aug. 11, 2011, document
on file with the Bay Area Air Quality Management District. </p>
<p>Other process units at the refinery include a 64,800-
barrel-a-day diesel hydrotreater, a 96,000-barrel-a-day jet
hydrotreater, a 57,600-barrel-a-day naphtha hydrotreater, a
90,000-barrel-a-day fluid catalytic cracker plant and a 60,900-
barrel-a-day isocracker, according to the document. </p>
<p>A vapor leak of hydrocarbons that began in the crude unit
at about 4:15 p.m. local time yesterday increased and ignited at
6:30 p.m., Kulp said in an interview on KQED radio. </p>
<p>Hundreds of people have sought medical treatment for
minor complaints since the blaze broke out, Randy Sawyer,
the director of Contra Costa County''s hazardous materials
division, said by telephone from Martinez, California. </p>
<p>All employees at the refinery have been accounted for, and
three employees were treated on site for minor injuries, Brent Tippen, a San Ramon, California-based Chevron spokesman, said in
a phone interview today. </p>
<h2>Evacuation Report </h2>
<p>The plant reported an evacuation after the fire broke out,
a filing with the California Emergency Management Agency shows. </p>
<p>The Contra Costa County health-services department issued a
shelter-in-place advisory for Richmond, North Richmond and San
Pablo because of the fire. The advisory was lifted late
yesterday. </p>
<p>The Richmond plant is about 110 years old, according to
Chevron''s website. Built on a peninsula of low hills rising from
San Francisco Bay, the refinery became the West Coast''s largest
and most advanced upon its completion in 1902. The refinery
produces gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, lubricants and other oil
products, according to the company''s website. </p>
<p>Chevron shut a crude unit at Richmond on Nov. 14 after
vacuum residuum, made up of heavy hydrocarbons, leaked from a
bleeder on a filter and auto ignited, Chevron said in a
filing to county regulators following that incident. The unit
was returned to service later that same month, two people with
direct knowledge of the plant''s operations said Nov. 29. A crude
unit at the refinery also caught fire in January 2007. </p>
<p>The county''s hazardous materials division was at the
refinery testing air quality after yesterday''s fire, according
to a notice from the county health department. The plant
released sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, hydrogen oxide,
sulfuric acid and nitrogen dioxide because of the fire, the
state filing shows. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley bought a North Sea
Forties crude cargo at the highest price in four months after a
loading program showed exports of the blend for September will
drop to the lowest in at least five years. No bids or offers
were made for Russian Urals in Europe. </p>
<p>Shipments of Brent, Forties, Oseberg and Ekofisk, which
make up the Dated Brent benchmark, will total 720,000 barrels a
day, the lowest level since August 2007, when Bloomberg started
compiling the data, according to shipping plans obtained by
Bloomberg News. That''s 7 percent less than 774,194 barrels a day
in August. </p>
<h2>North Sea </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley bought Forties shipment F0815 for Aug. 29 to
Aug. 31 loading from Trafigura Beheer BV at 60 cents a barrel
more than Dated Brent, the highest since April 5, according to a
Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
trading window. That compares with a premium of 45 cents for a
trade yesterday. </p>
<p>Total SA failed to buy the blend for Aug. 26 to Aug. 31 at
55 cents more than Dated Brent, the survey showed. </p>
<p>Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Before the session,
Forties loading in 10 to 25 days was unchanged at 44 cents a
barrel more than Dated Brent, the highest since July 16, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Brent for September settlement traded at $111.55 a barrel
on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, up from $109.02 yesterday. The October contract was at
$109.93, a discount of $1.62 to September. </p>
<p>Exports of Forties crude for September are planned at 10
cargoes of 600,000 barrels each, five less than August,
according to a loading program. </p>
<p>Loadings of Alvheim crude for September will be unchanged
from this month at five cargoes of 780,000 barrels each, a
separate shipping schedule showed. </p>
<p>The share of Buzzard crude in the Forties blend increased
to 65 percent in the week to Aug. 5, up from 50 percent a week
earlier, BP Plc (BP/) said today on its website. </p>
<p>BP''s Unity Riser oil and natural gas facility in the U.K.
North Sea may return today after shutting on Aug. 1 for planned
maintenance, company spokesman Mark Salt said by telephone from
Aberdeen, Scotland. </p>
<p>Statoil ASA (STL) plans maintenance at its Troll A oil and
natural gas field in Norway in September, spokesman Ola Anders
Skauby said in an e-mail, without specifying dates. </p>
<h2>Mediterranean/Urals </h2>
<p>Urals rose 3 cents to a premium of 43 cents a barrel to
Dated Brent in the Mediterranean, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>
<p>One cargo of 80,000 metric tons of Siberian Light crude was
added to the loading program for July from Russia''s Black Sea
port of Novorossiysk, two traders with knowledge of the shipping
plan said. </p>
<p>The shipment, owned by OAO Gazprom, was for loading on July
30 to July 31, said the people, who declined to be identified
because the information is confidential. It raised total exports
from the port last month to 3.56 million tons, including 3.16
million tons of Urals crude and 400,000 tons of Siberian Light,
according to a loading plan. </p>
<h2>West Africa </h2>
<p>Nigerian benchmark Qua Iboe rose 2 cents to $1.42 a barrel
more than Dated Brent, the highest since June 20, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>

<p>Potential changes in a U.S.
government mandate for ethanol are unlikely to materially
impact demand for the gasoline additive made from corn, Morgan
Stanley said. </p>
<p>Livestock producers and some U.S. lawmakers have asked
President Barack Obama''s administration to cut a requirement
that refiners use ethanol, after drought spurred corn prices to
surge to a record last month. Blenders are unlikely to stop
using ethanol even if the mandate is scrapped, because the fuel
additive is trading at a discount to gasoline, Morgan Stanley
analysts including Vincent Andrews and Hussein Allidina wrote in
an e-mailed report today. </p>
<p>Economics, not politics, drives ethanol use, Andrews
and Allidina wrote. Other than an outright ban on ethanol use,
we do not believe that any policy change will materially impact
ethanol demand, and therefore corn prices. </p>
<p>Denatured ethanol futures are up 20 percent since mid-June
on the Chicago Board of Trade, while corn surged 59 percent as
the U.S. Department of Agriculture declared more than half of
the country''s counties as disaster areas because of drought.
Refiners will be required to use 13.2 billion gallons of ethanol
this year, under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandate. </p>
<p>More than 150 U.S. lawmakers petitioned last week the
Environmental Protection Agency, which regulates the renewable-
fuels market, to limit the RFS requirement. A coalition of
livestock producers, including the National Cattlemen''s Beef
Association and the National Pork Producers Council, have said
the ethanol mandate is causing severe economic harm for
farmers. </p>
<h2>Gas Prices </h2>
<p>Repealing the mandate would set a very negative precedent
for future government endeavors that required side-by-side
private sector investment, Andrews and Allidina wrote. Job
losses and higher gas prices also would result from scrapping
the RFS, so the government is unlikely to act, they said. </p>
<p>The U.S. would still need to produce 12.9 billion gallons
of ethanol this year for the country''s gasoline supply, even if
the biofuel policy changes, Andrews and Allidina wrote. </p>
<p>Blenders have significant structural impediments
against switching away from ethanol, including industry
requirements for octane and oxygenates for which ethanol remains
the least expensive source. Futures prices for corn, ethanol and
gasoline also suggest that blending will remain profitable
well into the future, they said. </p>

<p>Wheat traded in Paris may rise
relative to futures in Chicago as prospects of declining
production in the former Soviet Union mean Europe is likely to
gain export market share, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs recommended buying wheat for delivery in
March 2013 on NYSE Liffe in Paris, against a bearish bet for
March 2013 wheat on the Chicago Board of Trade, New York-based
analyst Damien Courvalin said today in an e-mailed report. CBOT
wheat prices have surged 41 percent since the end of May,
bolstered by drought in the U.S., while Paris wheat climbed 23
percent in the same period. </p>
<p>Russia and Ukraine, which also have suffered from dry
weather this year, face potential for export restrictions on
grain, Courvalin said. In 2010, Paris wheat surged 92 percent,
outpacing a 47 percent gain in Chicago futures, after the worst
drought in 50 years spurred Russia to halt exports for 10
months. </p>
<p>With CBOT wheat prices trading at a premium to Black Sea
and EU wheat prices despite higher freight costs, we expect this
export demand to initially be directed to EU-27 wheat
supplies, Courvalin said. Shipments from both the EU and the
U.S. may be larger than the U.S. Department of Agriculture
currently estimates, he said. </p>
<p>The U.S. is expected to be the world''s biggest wheat
exporter this year, followed by Australia, Canada, the 27-
country bloc of the European Union, and Russia, according to the
USDA. </p>
<h2>World Production </h2>
<p>Global wheat production may total 652.1 million metric tons
in the 2012-13 season, less than the USDA''s July forecast of
665.3 million tons, as smaller harvests in Russia, Kazakhstan,
Argentina and China offset increasing output in the U.S., EU and
Canada, Courvalin wrote. The USDA is scheduled to update its
outlook on Aug. 10. </p>
<p>Goldman pegged global wheat inventories, excluding China
and India, at 93.7 million tons, the lowest since the 2007-08
season, according to the report. </p>
<p>U.S. corn production may be 10.75 million bushels, below
the USDA''s forecast of 12.97 million, Courvalin said. Demand for
wheat used in livestock feed may increase in coming months as
drought slashes corn supplies, he said. </p>
<p>A further deterioration in weather conditions, potential
FSU export restrictions and pent-up import demand create risks
that global wheat inventories decline even more than we
expect, Courvalin said. Such an outcome in the face of
inelastic food demand would likely push wheat prices sharply
higher and well above corn prices to price wheat out of feed
demand. </p>
<p>The bank reiterated its forecasts for CBOT wheat prices at
$9.80 a bushel in three months, $8.75 in six months and $7.75 in
12 months. The December contract traded today at $9.09. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX) said it contained a
fire that broke out in the crude unit at its Richmond refinery,
the largest in Northern California. </p>
<p>The company was bringing down units after a blaze at the
No. 4 crude unit started yesterday around 6:15 p.m. local time,
according to a person with direct knowledge of the operation who
asked not to be identified because the information isn''t public. </p>
<p>Flames were brought under control as of 10:30 p.m. local
time, and all employees at the refinery have been accounted for,
said Melissa Ritchie, a Chevron spokeswoman at the plant. One
person was being treated for minor burns on the wrist, she said.
The plant reported an evacuation after the fire broke out, a
filing with the California Emergency Management Agency shows. </p>
<p>Crews determined there was a diesel leak from a line in
the crude unit that may have started the fire, Ritchie said. She
declined to confirm the definite cause of the incident. </p>
<p>The Contra Costa County health-services department issued a
shelter-in-place advisory for Richmond, North Richmond and San
Pablo because of the fire. The agency recommended that residents
stay inside their homes or the nearest buildings, bring pets
indoors, close doors and windows, and make sure vents and
fireplaces are closed. </p>
<p>The Richmond plant can process 240,000 barrels a day of
feedstock, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The plant is about
110 years old, according to the company''s website. Built on a
peninsula of low hills rising from San Francisco Bay, the
refinery became the West Coast''s largest and most-advanced plant
upon its completion in July 1902, according to the website. </p>
<h2>Hazardous Materials </h2>
<p>The county''s hazardous materials division was at the
refinery to test air quality, according to a notice from the

because of the fire, the state filing shows. </p>
<p>BART, the regional transit system, halted service between
the Richmond station and El Cerrito Plaza, a notice on the

<p>The refinery produces gasoline, jet fuel, diesel,
lubricants and other oil products, according to the company''s
website. The plant is one of six refineries that make up more
than 75 percent of Chevron''s total refining capacity, the
website shows. </p>
<h2>Nov. 14 Incident </h2>
<p>The refinery shut a crude unit on Nov. 14 after vacuum
residuum, made up of heavy hydrocarbons, leaked from a bleeder
on a filter and auto ignited, Chevron said in a filing to
county regulators following that fire. The unit was returned to
service later that same month, two people with direct knowledge
of the plant''s operations said Nov. 29. </p>
<p>Chevron''s oil refineries and filling stations earned $1.88
billion as U.S. processing margins climbed to a second-quarter
record average of $28.98 a barrel when crude costs fell faster
than gasoline prices. </p>
<p>Chevron''s net income fell to $7.21 billion, or $3.66 a
share, from $7.73 billion, or $3.85, a year earlier, the San
Ramon, California-based company said in a statement July 27. The

<p>Jim O''Neill ushered in a decade-long
investment boom in 2001 when he coined the term BRICs for the
largest emerging markets. This year, a lesser-known acronym that
the Goldman Sachs Asset Management chairman is helping to
popularize has taken over for many investors. </p>
<p>The so-called MIST nations -- Mexico, Indonesia, South
Korea and Turkey -- are the four biggest markets in the Goldman
Sachs N-11 Equity Fund. (GSYAX) Opened in February, 2011 to invest in
what O''Neill considers the next big 11 emerging markets, the
fund has climbed 12 percent this year, compared with a 1.5
percent gain in Goldman Sachs''s fund for Brazil, Russia, India
and China. </p>
<p>We see steady inflows into the Next 11 fund each week,
O''Neill, 55, said in a phone interview from London. It hasn''t
been affected by the disappointment in the U.S. and obviously
the European markets especially, and all the disappointment in
some of the BRIC markets. </p>
<p>O''Neill said he came up with the idea for an N-11 fund on a
trip to China and South Korea two years ago as a way to help
investors benefit from growth beyond the BRIC nations that had
dominated emerging markets investing. With populations that for
the most part are younger than the U.S. and Europe and have
higher birth rates, fueling economic expansion, the N-11 nations
are emerging from the shadow of the BRICs, where growth is
slowing and investors are pulling out funds. </p>
<h2>Outpacing BRIC </h2>
<p>The MIST economies more than doubled in size in the past
decade, topping Germany last year. In Mexico, Latin America''s
second-biggest economy, record auto exports are helping growth
outpace Brazil''s for a second year amid waning Chinese demand
for the South American nation''s commodities. Indonesia''s
domestic spending and investment helped the nation''s economic
growth accelerate to 6.37 percent in the second quarter,
surprising economists who forecast a slowdown. </p>
<p>Besides the MIST nations, the N-11 countries include
Bangladesh, Egypt, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines and
Vietnam. Iran is also a member, though Goldman Sachs says its
fund doesn''t invest in Iran because it isn''t an open market for
foreign investors. The nation is subject to sanctions imposed by
the U.S. and European Union over its nuclear program. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s N-11 fund has beaten 93 percent of U.S.-
based emerging-market equity funds this year, while the BRIC
fund has lagged 89 percent of them, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The N-11 fund has still trailed its benchmark, the
MSCI GDP Weighted Next 11 ex-Iran Index, which has climbed 17
percent this year. The MSCI BRIC Index (MXBRIC) has risen 1.7 percent
this year, more than the 1.5 percent gain for the Goldman Sachs
BRIC fund. </p>
<h2>Fuelling Growth </h2>
<p>While outperforming them in growth this year, the MIST
nations don''t approach the BRICs in economic output or
population. Total GDP for the MIST nations was $3.9 trillion
last year, less than one third of the $13.5 trillion BRIC
economies and compared with $7.3 trillion for China alone,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In population, the MIST
nations have fewer than 500 million people, compared with about
2.9 billion in the BRIC nations. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s N-11 fund had $113 million in assets and
was invested in 73 stocks at the end of the second quarter,
while the New York-based bank''s BRIC fund had $410 million in
assets and held 72 stocks. </p>
<p>While O''Neill isn''t involved in either fund''s management,
they were built to capture economic growth in the nations he
identified as likely to make the greatest increased contribution
to global GDP. The MIST nations accounted for about 73 percent
of N-11 GDP last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Paying Off </h2>
<p>The investment strategy is paying off. Mexico''s benchmark
IPC Index (MEXBOL) has climbed 11 percent this year, compared with a 2.8
percent gain in Brazil''s Bovespa. (IBOV) Turkey''s ISE National 100
Index (XU100) has surged 28 percent and Indonesia''s Jakarta Composite
Index (JCI) has gained 7.4 percent, while South Korea''s Kospi (KOSPI) has
increased 3.3 percent. </p>
<p>The BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX) is the best-performing among
BRICs equity benchmarks, increasing 13 percent, compared with a
2.6 percent gain in Russia''s Micex Index (INDEXCF) and a 2 percent drop in
the Shanghai Composite Index. (SHCOMP) By comparison, the Standard 
Poor''s 500 Index (SPX) is up 11 percent this year, while the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index (SXXP) has climbed 9.1 percent. </p>
<p>You''ve seen a rotation in the leadership based on rate of
economic growth, said Paul Christopher, the St. Louis-based
chief international strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors, the
third-largest U.S. brokerage with $1.2 trillion in client
assets. If you go back as far as just 2009, you''ll find people
buying the BRIC story in a big way, and probably over-buying the
BRIC story. </p>
<h2>Pouring in Money </h2>
<p>Investors poured about $67 billion into BRIC stocks from
2001 to 2010 as they beat the SP 500 by 281 percentage points.
They withdrew about $15 billion last year, the most on an annual
basis since at least 1996, according to Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based research firm EPFR Global. </p>
<p>Still, equity funds investing in the MIST nations haven''t
been immune from global growth concern. While investors added a
net $104 million to funds focused on Turkey and $123 million to
Indonesian funds this year through Aug. 1, they withdrew $1.33
billion from South Korea and $115 million from Mexico, EPFR
says. </p>
<p>The MIST nations each account for at least 1 percent of
global GDP and are likely to see that share increase this
decade, O''Neill said. Of the four countries, O''Neill said Mexico
and Turkey are the most attractive at the moment. </p>
<h2>Low-Cost </h2>
<p>Mexico is increasingly competing with China for
manufacturing as costs climb in the Asian nation, O''Neill said.
Mexico''s economy grew 4.6 percent in the first three months of
2012, the fastest pace in six quarters, on increased shipments
to the U.S. America Movil SAB (AMXL), the wireless carrier controlled
by billionaire Carlos Slim, the world''s richest person according
to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, was the top holding in the
N-11 fund at 7.9 percent at the end of June. </p>
<p>Brazil, which grew at an average 3.7 percent annual rate
from 2000 through 2010, trumping Mexico''s 2.1 percent expansion,
is forecast to grow less than 3 percent for a second straight
year in 2012, according to the median estimate of analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo''s Christopher advised investors to sell stocks
in the BRIC nations at points in the first half of the year and
recommends buying equities in Indonesia, where economic growth
has exceeded 6 percent for seven quarters. Plans by the
government in Southeast Asia''s largest economy to build
railways, airports and seaports to bind its islands closer
together are helping to counter a slowdown in European demand
for commodities exports. </p>
<p>Christopher also recommends buying stocks in South Korea,
which he says will benefit from rising exports as China''s
domestic spending climbs. </p>
<h2>Credit Rating </h2>
<p>Fitch Ratings and Moody''s Investors Service have raised
Indonesia''s debt to investment grade in the past eight months,
with Fitch increasing it to BBB- in December and Moody''s lifting
it to Baa3 in January. </p>
<p>The credit outlook in India is moving in the opposite
direction. India''s economy grew 5.3 percent in the first
quarter, the least in nine years, and SP warns that the country
may be downgraded unless growth picks up and political
roadblocks to decision-making are overcome. A blackout left 640
million people in India without light on July 31, a day after a
separate power cut left 360 million people without electricity. </p>
<p>India is suffering from an absence of effective
leadership, O''Neill said. India always is very proud of the
fact it''s the biggest democracy in the world, but as I
frequently joke with them, India''s democracy is so good that it
doesn''t work. </p>
<p>A phone call to the Indian embassy in Washington seeking
comment wasn''t immediately returned. </p>
<h2>Open Economies </h2>
<p>With the exception of China, all the MIST nations ranked
higher on the Geneva-based World Economic Forum''s 2012 trade
openness index than the BRIC countries. While South Korea was
ranked 34 out of 132 and Indonesia 58th, Russia trailed in
position 112 and India at 100. </p>
<p>Turkish stocks have rallied after the government cut its
fiscal deficit to 1.3 percent of GDP last year from 3.6 percent
in 2010, garnering a credit rating upgrade by Moody''s on June 20
to Ba1, one level below investment grade. </p>
<p>Russia''s $1.8 trillion economy, after unexpectedly
accelerating in the first quarter, is feeling the squeeze from
oil prices that plunged as much as 22 percent this year. The
price of crude pared its losses in July and is now down 6.7
percent since the end of December. Russia relies on oil and gas
exports for half of its budget revenue. </p>
<h2>Russia''s Economy </h2>
<p>Former finance minister Alexei Kudrin said on May 24 that
Russia''s economy has a 50 percent chance of slipping into
recession due to the crisis in Europe, the buyer of more than
half its exports. Russia''s gross domestic product may grow as
much as 4 percent this year, more than the government''s previous
projection of 3.4 percent, Economy Minister Andrei Belousov said
on July 20. </p>
<p>While O''Neill includes South Korea in the MIST grouping,
the nation differs from the other three in demographics,
development and wealth. Known as one of the Asian Tigers as it
grew an average 9 percent from the 1970s until the Asian
financial crisis in 1997, South Korea will expand 2.9 percent
this year, according to the median estimate of analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Aging Society </h2>
<p>South Korea lacks the youth that O''Neill says will help
drive growth in the other MIST nations. Only about 16 percent of
South Korea''s population is under the age of 15, compared with
at least 25 percent in Mexico, Indonesia and Turkey, according
to estimates by the New York-based United Nations. </p>
<p>South Korea happens to be the only populated country that
in my lifetime has transformed its income from that of an
African country to being that of a G-7 country, O''Neill said.
It''s an example that all these other countries can learn
from. </p>
<p>The MIST nations may not outperform the BRICs for long,
especially now that China''s government is stepping in to prime
the economy, O''Neill said. Moreover, the Shanghai Composite''s
decline has left it valued at 9.6 times estimated profit,
compared with the three-year average of 14.7. The MSCI BRIC
Index trades for about 9 times estimated profit, compared with
13.5 times for the SP 500, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<h2>Economic Weight </h2>
<p>The recent underperformance in BRIC equities isn''t reason
to give up on the long-term potential of economies that grew at
an average pace four times faster than the U.S. from 2001
through 2010, O''Neill said. He forecasts that the BRIC nations
will grow an average of about 6.5 percent a year through 2020,
compared with 5.5 percent for the N-11 group. </p>
<p>O''Neill says he has three times turned down requests from
Goldman Sachs salespeople to start a fund focused only on the
MIST countries, and not only for economic reasons. </p>
<p>You get very large exposure to them in the N-11 fund,
O''Neill said. I''m also quite cognizant of not going down in
history as being the guy that just constantly created
acronyms. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX)''s Richmond refinery,
the largest in northern California, is running a gasoline-making
unit at about 60 percent capacity following an Aug. 6 fire that
shut the crude unit, a person familiar with production said. </p>
<p>The 240,000-barrel-a-day plant is operating the fluid
catalytic cracker, which processes vacuum gasoil into gasoline
and lighter products, off of feedstock stored in tanks, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the information
isn''t public. The refinery is also running one of two units at
an Isomax hydrocracking complex at 60 percent capacity and the
lube plant at low rates, the person said. </p>
<p>The blaze, which brought down the crude unit indefinitely,
sent gasoline in San Francisco up 29.5 cents to 35 cents a
gallon above futures traded in New York yesterday, data compiled
by Bloomberg shows. That was the highest level in almost three
months and the largest single-day increase since at least
November 2007. </p>
<p>Melissa Ritchie, a Chevron spokeswoman at the refinery,
didn''t immediately respond to an e-mailed request for comment.
She said in an e-mail today that the San Ramon, California-based
company was working to repair affected equipment. </p>
<p>The refinery extinguished a second fire at the plant that
ignited at about 11:30 a.m. local time near the site of the Aug.
6 blaze, Ritchie said in a separate e-mail. Nobody was injured,
and the fire was put out within minutes, she said. </p>
<p>The refinery is still performing a controlled burn of
fuel from the original fire, she said. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s biggest
drugmaker, agreed to pay $60.2 million to settle foreign bribery
cases it brought to U.S. authorities involving alleged payments
paid by employees and agents of subsidiaries. </p>
<p>Pfizer entered into two agreements with the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the New York-based drugmaker reached a
deferred prosecution accord with the Department of Justice,
according to filings yesterday in federal court in Washington. </p>
<p>U.S. law enforcement authorities have been probing
drugmakers for possibly breaking an overseas anti-bribery law
that bars employees or their agents from paying bribes to
foreign government officials to obtain or retain business.
Yesterday''s settlements stem from payments and gifts Pfizer said
its foreign units made to government-employed doctors and
workers in eastern Europe, China and the Middle East, according
to the filings. </p>
<p>The SEC said the payoffs were made without the knowledge
or approval of officers or employees of Pfizer, but the
inaccurate books and records of Pfizer subsidiaries were
consolidated in the financial reports of Pfizer. </p>
<p>Pfizer alerted U.S. authorities in 2004 after probing the
claims. More payments were found when the drugmaker bought its
Wyeth unit in 2009. </p>
<p>The actions which led to this resolution were
disappointing, but the openness and speed with which Pfizer
voluntarily disclosed and addressed them reflects our true
culture and the real value we place on integrity and meeting
commitments, Amy Schulman, Pfizer''s general counsel, said in
an e-mailed statement. We expect every colleague across Pfizer
to adhere to the highest standards of conduct. </p>
<p>Prosecutors agreed to defer prosecution and drop the
charges after two years if Pfizer continues to cooperate and
take remedial steps. The settlements must be approved by a
federal judge. </p>
<p>The Pfizer cases are U.S. Securities of Exchange Commission
v. Pfizer Inc., 12-cv-01303; U.S. Securities of Exchange
Commission v. Wyeth LLC, 12-cv-1304; and U.S. v. Pfizer HCP

<h2>Compliance Policy </h2>
<h2>Halkbank CEO Aslan Says Turkey May Need to Act on Bad Loans </h2>
<p>Turkiye Halk Bankasi AS (HALKB) Chief Executive Officer Suleyman
Aslan said Turkey''s central bank and regulators may need to act
should bad loans in the nation''s financial system worsen. </p>
<p>Halkbank, as the lender is known, is Turkey''s biggest
listed state-run bank. Aslan, speaking in a televised interview
with the CNBC-e news channel yesterday, didn''t specify what
measures he wanted policymakers to take, though he said the
central bank''s average lending rate to banks was rather
high. He also said lenders'' asset structures are not
breaking down as a result of bad loans. </p>
<p>Turkey''s economic growth is forecast to slow to 2.3 percent
this year from 8.5 percent in 2011, the International Money Fund
said in April, while central bank data shows non-performing
consumer loans rose 4.4 percent in the first six months of 2012
compared with a year earlier, led by unpaid credit-card bills. </p>
<p>Aslan yesterday forecast that the Turkish central bank will
ease monetary policy. Turkish banks'' provisions may increase
this year because of non-performing loans caused by a slowdown
in the economy, Duygun Kutucu, an analyst at EFG Istanbul
Securities, said in a telephone interview on July 31 </p>
<h2>Ecuador Tightens Controls on Transfers to Maintain Liquidity </h2>
<p>Ecuador will boost controls on cash transfers by banks in
an attempt to maintain liquidity in the South American nation''s
financial system, central bank President Pedro Delgado said
yesterday. </p>
<p>Banks are keeping some foreign clients'' funds in
international accounts to avoid paying a 5 percent capital-
export tax for money they need to move outside the country,
Delgado said to reporters in Quito. The controls will force
banks to increase the amount they bring into the country and
raise the amount of tax they pay to export cash, he said. </p>
<p>Faced with falling revenue as oil prices decline and
economic growth slows, the government said last month all cash
transfers into Ecuador must go through the central bank before
reaching their final destination. </p>
<h2>Compliance Action </h2>
<h2>Standard Chartered Falls Most in 24 Years on N.Y. Iran Probe </h2>
<p>Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) fell the most in almost 24 years as
an analyst estimated it may face costs of $5.5 billion after
being accused of violating U.S. money laundering laws over its
dealings with Iranian banks. </p>
<p>Standard Chartered may lose its license to operate in New
York after the state''s Department of Financial Services found
the bank conducted $250 billion of deals with Iranian banks over
seven years and earned hundreds of millions of dollars in fees
for handling transactions for institutions subject to U.S.
economic sanctions. The London-based lender yesterday denied the
allegations, saying it strongly rejects the position and
portrayal of facts made by the regulator. </p>
<p>The bank may be fined $1.5 billion by U.S. regulators, lose
about $1 billion of revenue from its Iranian operation and a
further $3 billion in market value if senior managers quit,
Cormac Leech, an analyst at London-based Liberum Capital Ltd.
who rates the stock a buy, wrote in a note to investors
yesterday. </p>

<h2>CFPB Eases Rules on Some International Money Transfers </h2>
<p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has updated its
international money transfer rule to make the process easier for
community banks, credit unions, and financial institutions
handling 100 or fewer remittances a year, according to a
statement on the consumer bureau''s website. </p>
<p>The rule implements protections provided under the Dodd-
Frank law requiring remittance transfer providers to disclose
upfront the fees, exchange rate, and the amount to be received.
The revised rule also provides consumers with rights when errors
or cancellations occur. </p>
<p>The final remittance rule will take effect Feb 7, the
consumer bureau said in the statement. </p>
<h2>Courts/Tribunals </h2>
<h2>Morgan Stanley Derivative Accord Wins Approval in First Case </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) won approval of a $4.8 million accord with
the U.S. over claims it helped manipulate electricity prices, in
what the Justice Department called its first effort to get
disgorgement from a financial firm that used derivatives to aid
anticompetitive behavior. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan turned
aside complaints from not-for-profits AARP and New York Public
Service Commission that under the agreement Morgan Stanley
didn''t have to admit wrongdoing and didn''t pay enough. Pauley,
citing the Justice Department, said the case marks the first
time the government filed an antitrust suit against a financial
firm involving derivative agreements. </p>
<p>Pauley wrote that deference to the government''s decision to
settle was appropriate, despite the relatively mild
sanction, because of the novelty of the government''s
theory. </p>
<p>An admission of liability is not a prerequisite for
judicial approval of an agency settlement, Pauley said, citing
a recent ruling by a federal appeals court in a case involving
Citigroup Inc. </p>
<p>Mary Claire Delaney, a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley,
declined to comment on the judge''s approval of the settlement. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Morgan Stanley, 11-6875, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Telkom SA Ltd. (TKG) was fined 449 million rand ($55 million) for
abusing its dominance in South African telecommunications
between 1999 and 2004, less than the 3.25 billion rand the
Competition Commission had sought. </p>
<p>The Competition Tribunal concluded that Telkom leveraged
its upstream monopoly in the facilities market to advantage its
own subsidiary in the competitive value added network market,
the Pretoria-based tribunal said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday. </p>
<p>Telkom is studying the judgment and its implications, it
said in a statement yesterday. </p>
<p>The Competition Commission investigated Africa''s largest
fixed-line phone operator and asked the tribunal to impose a
fine of 3.25 billion rand at hearings that lasted until early
this year. The commission''s probe followed five separate
complaints of anti-competitive behavior lodged by Internet
service providers between 2005 and 2007. </p>
<p>Telkom, based in Pretoria, must pay half the penalty within
six months and the balance within the following 12 months, the
tribunal said. </p>

<p>Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA)
plaintiffs in a lawsuit over swipe, interchange, fees have until
Oct. 19 to formally request approval of a more than $6 billion
settlement, according to a filing unsealed in Brooklyn, New
York, federal court. </p>
<p>U.S. Magistrate Judge James Orenstein ordered that the
agenda be made public today following a hearing on the status of
the case, which was the first court appearance since the
settlement was unveiled last month. </p>
<p>The deal, which would settle allegations of interchange fee
price-fixing, promises to provide merchants with cash payments
as well as a temporary reduction in interchange fees and the
potential for surcharges to cover future interchange costs. </p>
<p>Opposition to the accord has grown over the past few weeks,
with groups including the National Cooperative Grocers
Association and retail giants Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target
Corp. issuing statements saying the settlement doesn''t do enough
for merchants. </p>
<p>We are making progress and getting the underlying
documents drafted, K. Craig Wildfang, an attorney for the
plaintiffs, said in court regarding a motion for approval of the
settlement. We are going as fast as we can. Not as fast as we
would like. </p>
<p>The National Cooperative Grocers Association and the
National Association of Convenience Stores plan to fight the
settlement in court, Jeffrey Shinder, a lawyer for the groups,
said in a phone interview. </p>
<h2>Serious Issues'' </h2>
<p>There are serious issues with the settlement, he said.
The trade association named plaintiffs who came out against
it, all of the members of their boards -- flesh and blood
merchants -- voted against it. </p>
<p>The convenience store group, which issued its statement
within minutes of the settlement''s disclosure on July 13, said
the deal amounts to only two months'' worth of roughly
$50 billion in swipe fees collected annually by payment
networks. The deal also doesn''t prevent Visa or MasterCard from
raising fees in the future, the group said. Other measures under
the deal would only be allowed under strict oversight of Visa
and MasterCard, making them unworkable for merchants, the
group said. </p>
<p>Target said in a statement that the proposed settlement
would perpetuate a broken system. Wal-Mart said in a
statement that we encourage all merchants to put consumers
first and reject the settlement. </p>
<h2>Final Approval </h2>
<p>Visa Chairman and CEO Joseph Saunders told investors in a
conference call on July 25 that he expected a federal judge to
grant preliminary approval to the settlement in the fall. The
court must also grant final approval to the deal before it can
be implemented. </p>
<p>The accord followed roughly a roughly a seven-year legal
battle, according to lawyers for the plaintiffs. </p>
<p>This settlement agreement is the result of seven years of
negotiation which makes us confident that the court will agree
that this is fair to all parties, Trish Wexler, a spokeswoman
for the Electronic Payments Coalition, which favors the deal,
said in an e-mail statement. </p>
<p>The recent statements that we''ve heard from a handful of
retailers are nothing new and have already been considered
during the course of this long negotiation, she said. </p>
<p>The case is In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant
Discount Antitrust Litigation, 05-md-01720, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) is retooling an
electronic bond-brokering system as the Wall Street bank with
the biggest drop in fixed-income revenue last quarter seeks to
increase its share in a market moving toward automated trades. </p>
<p>The Morgan Stanley Bond Pool network picks a group of
securities and matches buyers and sellers who express interest
through the system, offering lower transaction costs than what
investors typically get in privately negotiated trades, the bank
said in marketing documents dated last month and obtained by
Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>Created last year, the system was revamped and the bank
introduced the new version to clients within the past month,
according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to
be identified because the program hasn''t been made public. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley joins Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and UBS AG (UBSN) in
starting automated systems to exchange bonds in an effort to
maintain their grip on transaction fees as investors from
Fidelity Investments to BlackRock Inc. (BLK) push for cheaper and
faster ways to trade debt. Networks run by firms from Bonds.com
Group Inc. (BDCG) to MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (MKTX) threaten to siphon off
the revenue Wall Street makes from the difference between offers
to buy and sell the securities. </p>
<p>Mary Claire Delaney, a spokeswoman for the New York-based
bank, declined to comment on the marketing documents. </p>
<h2>Invited Clients'' </h2>
<p>In Bond Pool, which is part of the global credit sales and
trading unit, Morgan Stanley traders submit market mid-prices
and conditional bids and offers for a set of bonds, according to
the marketing documents. </p>
<p>Customers are invited to bid, and the bank matches buyers
with sellers at the close of a specified time window. Market-
makers can fill any leftover interest. Sales teams at the bank
then approach participants with proposed trades, which the
parties have to agree to before the transaction is completed,
according to the presentation. </p>
<p>Sessions take place as frequently as client and trader
interest dictate, and as quickly as the system allows,
according to the documents. </p>
<p>The platform, which is offered through the firm''s Matrix
application, is the latest attempt by Morgan Stanley to use
technology to improve its fixed-income trading performance. The
firm started Matrix in 2009, which provided clients with
research, analytics, live prices and trading capability for some
fixed-income products. </p>
<h2>Curbing Risk </h2>
<p>The firm has expanded its Morgan Stanley Electronic Trading
technology, which was developed for equities and foreign
exchange, into fixed-income, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat
said last year. In 2010, it hired Dexter Senft from Barclays Plc
as head of e-commerce for the fixed-income unit. </p>
<p>The efforts support Chief Executive Officer James Gorman''s
goal of increasing market share while reducing so-called risk-
weighted assets in the fixed-income business, which the bank has
cut by 15 percent since the 2011''s third quarter. That reduction
will rise to 30 percent by the end of 2014, Gorman said last
month. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s second-quarter fixed-income trading
revenue dropped 60 percent from a year earlier, excluding
accounting adjustments. That was the largest decline among the
five largest Wall Street banks. </p>
<p>Investment banks will bring down compensation costs by
dismissing trading staff as automated transactions become more
prevalent, Boston Consulting Group Inc. said in an April report.
The industry will see little to no growth in the total revenue
pool over the next few years, BCG said. </p>
<p>The biggest dealers have cut company-debt holdings by 84
percent since 2007, according to Federal Reserve data, even as
the size of the U.S. corporate bond market expanded 40 percent
in the past three years, average daily trading volumes dropped
about 1 percent, data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority show. </p>
<p>New York-based Goldman Sachs also has an initiative,
GSessions, which debuted in June. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said U.S.
regulators ended an investigation of its role in selling $1.3
billion of mortgage-backed securities and won''t sue the firm,
reversing course after investigators warned in February that
they intended to recommend legal action. </p>
<p>Securities and Exchange Commission lawyers told Goldman
Sachs on Aug. 6 that they no longer planned to pursue claims
against the bank, the New York-based company said today in a
regulatory filing. The regulator had sent Goldman Sachs a so-
called Wells notice in February, which typically gives
recipients a chance to dissuade investigators from recommending
the agency authorize enforcement action. </p>
<p>The SEC''s investigation looked at disclosures during the
late-2006 offering of subprime residential mortgage-backed
securities underwritten by Goldman Sachs, according to the
firm''s filing. It didn''t elaborate on the SEC''s decisions. David
Wells, a spokesman for the firm, declined to comment. </p>
<p>A separate SEC lawsuit in April of 2010, accusing Goldman
Sachs of misleading investors in the sale of securities that bet
on subprime mortgages, caused the firm''s stock to plunge 13
percent on the day it was filed and roiled the broader market.
The investment bank paid $550 million to settle the case in July
that year, saying it had made a mistake in omitting
disclosures. </p>
<h2>Shares Rise </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets,
advanced 1.4 percent to $103.94 as of 10:34 a.m. in New York,
making it the second-best-performing bank in the Standard and
Poor''s 500 Financials Index of 81 companies including lenders,
brokerages and insurers. The shares have climbed 15 percent this
year. </p>
<p>Four years after mounting mortgage defaults prompted
unprecedented government bailouts of the financial system,
regulators are still examining how banks packaged and sold home
loans to investors. The SEC is looking for evidence that firms
failed to disclose underlying credit weaknesses in mortgage
pools and delinquencies, Jason Anthony, special counsel for the
agency''s structured-products unit, said in February. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., the largest U.S. bank, was warned by
SEC employees in January that they may recommend civil claims
from two inquiries, including one focusing on due diligence and
disclosures for two mortgage-backed securitizations. </p>
<p>The New York-based bank said today in a filing that it has
submitted responses to the agency''s proposed actions. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is being
investigated by at least 11 state, federal and international
enforcement bodies as the bank struggles to contain damage from
a botched derivatives trade that cost it at least $5.8 billion. </p>
<p>Authorities in Singapore, Germany and Japan have joined the
list of agencies probing the largest U.S. bank''s trading errors,
the company said in a regulatory filing today. The U.S. Justice
Department, Congress, Securities and Exchange Commission and
U.K. Financial Services Authority are among those examining the
bank, which could still lose as much as $1.7 billion more on its
credit derivatives portfolio, the company said. The bungled
trade may also make it more difficult to resolve other pending
reviews, the company said. </p>
<p>The firm expects heightened scrutiny by its regulators of
its compliance with new and existing regulations, the company
said. Regulators will more frequently bring formal enforcement
actions for violations of law rather than resolving those
violations through informal supervisory processes. </p>
<p>The bank reiterated it found material weakness within
its internal controls and financial reporting related to the
trade and, as a result, its initial first-quarter results
couldn''t be relied on. </p>
<p>Eight civil lawsuits have already been filed since the bank
initially disclosed problems in its synthetic credit derivatives
book on May 10, the bank said. It is reasonably possible
that JPMorgan''s legal troubles could exceed its litigation
reserves by as much as $5.3 billion as of June 30, the bank
said. The Justice Department and SEC are also among agencies
investigating the bank''s possible role in an international bid-
rigging scheme to manipulate the London interbank offered rate,
or Libor, the bank said. </p>
<h2>Stock Slump </h2>
<p>The company''s stock market value has declined by more than
$25 billion since Bloomberg News first reported April 5 that the
bank had amassed a large and illiquid position in credit
derivatives at its chief investment office in London. JPMorgan
was unchanged at $37.16 at 9:50 a.m. in New York. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56, ousted traders and
managers and overhauled the ranks of senior executives after
initially disclosing trading losses in May. Chief Investment
Officer Ina Drew retired days later, voluntarily forfeiting as
much as two years of compensation, and the New York-based
company said it would seek to claw back pay of other executives. </p>
<p>The bank restated first-quarter results last month, paring
profit by $459 million, in part because an internal review
revealed that U.K. traders had priced their books
aggressively, Mike Cavanagh, who ran the investigation, told
analysts on July 13. Cavanagh, 46, was elevated in the shakeup
announced July 28 from head of Treasury and Security Services to
co-CEO of an expanded corporate and investment bank. </p>
<h2>Credit Derivatives </h2>
<p>The mispricing made losses on a portfolio of credit
derivatives look smaller than they were, and executives
concluded that traders may have sought to hide the full amount
of losses, JPMorgan said in a presentation. </p>
<p>The decision to restate results was made one day before
JPMorgan reported second-quarter net income of $4.96 billion,
and after executives and lawyers interviewed employees, and
reviewed thousands of hours of calls and about 1 million e-
mails, Cavanagh said in the call last month. </p>
<p>JPMorgan ended synthetic trading at the chief investment
office and transferred the rest of the position to the
investment bank, executives said last month. The CIO retained an
$11 billion short position in basically liquid indexes to
hedge other credit assets, Dimon said during a July 13 meeting
with analysts. Positions in Series 9 of the Markit CDX North
America Investment Grade Index, a credit-swaps benchmark known
as IG9 that''s at the heart of much of the loss, were cut by 70
percent, he said. </p>
<h2>Down Substantially'' </h2>
<p>The bank transferred about $30 billion of risk-weighted
assets from the CIO to the investment bank, an amount that''s
down substantially from an earlier peak and back to levels
at the end of 2011, he said. </p>
<p>Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine said July 14 that he''s
seeking to lead a proposed class-action against JPMorgan after
state pension funds lost more than $27.5 million due to the
alleged fraud. Two funds for state employees held about 10.2
million JPMorgan shares as of March 31, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Dimon transformed the unit in recent years to boost profit
by buying higher-yielding assets such as structured credit,
equities and derivatives, Bloomberg News reported on April 13,
citing former employees. </p>
<p>Dimon dismissed initial news reports about the London
operation as a tempest in a teapot when the bank reported
first-quarter results April 13. He reversed course less than
four weeks later, disclosing a $2 billion loss that he said
could grow to $3 billion or more during the quarter. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. credit-card lender, will contribute about $1.2 billion to
settle a price-fixing case brought by retailers over credit-card
swipe fees. </p>
<p>JPMorgan agreed to cover about 20 percent of a $6.05
billion deal to settle claims that the bank conspired with
MasterCard Inc. (MA) and Visa Inc. (V) to rig credit-card processing
fees, the New York-based bank said today in a filing. </p>
<p>Visa and MasterCard, the world''s biggest payment networks,
and some of the largest U.S. banks agreed last month to pay
merchants $6.6 billion and temporarily reduce credit-card swipe
fees, or interchange, to settle the antitrust lawsuit. The deal
includes cash payments of $6.05 billion to merchants who take
part in the proposed class action and $525 million to individual
plaintiffs. The larger amount would be reduced if some
plaintiffs don''t agree to participate. </p>
<p>Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the second-biggest U.S. credit-card
lender, said last week that it will contribute a total of $738
million to settle the case. Citigroup Inc. (C), the No. 3 card
issuer, said in an Aug. 3 filing that second-quarter expenses at
its North America consumer bank climbed 5 percent to $2.45
billion, an increase driven entirely by a boost in legal
reserves tied to the litigation. </p>

by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon. </p>
<p>Dimon, 56, had told analysts July 13 that the New York-
based lender may restart buybacks in this year''s fourth quarter,
if all goes well. Today, the bank said it hopes to recommence 
its equity repurchase program in the first quarter of 2013. </p>
<p>Doing so depends on the board''s completion of work on the
chief investment office, which lost $5.8 billion on wrong-way
bets in this year''s first half, and on the Federal Reserve''s
view of the bank''s resubmitted capital plan, JPMorgan said today
in a regulatory filing. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) posted more
unprofitable trading days than any quarter since the depth of
the financial crisis as the largest U.S. bank struggled to
unwind credit-derivatives bets. </p>
<p>Traders lost money on 28 days in the second quarter,
compared with one day in the first three months of the year, New
York-based JPMorgan said today in a regulatory filing. That was
more than in all of 2011 and the most since 37 days of losses in
the fourth quarter of 2008, after the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. roiled global markets. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56, ousted traders and
managers and overhauled the ranks of senior executives amid $5.8
billion in losses on a trading position at the chief investment
office in London. The losses prompted the retirement of Chief
Investment Officer Ina Drew and spurred shareholder lawsuits and
probes by the U.S. Justice Department, Federal Bureau of
Investigation and Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>
<p>The bank appreciably reduced the risk profile of the
derivatives portfolio during the quarter, JPMorgan said in the
filing. It said the portfolio under certain extreme, simulated
scenarios could lose as much as an additional $1.7 billion,
the same figure Dimon gave last month. </p>
<p>So-called value-at-risk, or VaR, which measures how much
the bank estimates it could lose on 95 percent of its trading
days, increased to $201 million during the second quarter from
an average of $94 million during the same period last year. </p>
<h2>Exceeding VaR </h2>
<p>Three of the daily losses during the second quarter
exceeded the firm''s VaR because of the synthetic credit
portfolio. </p>
<p>Traders in JPMorgan''s investment bank, chief investment
office and mortgage unit posted gains exceeding $200 million on
two days in the second quarter, compared with one day in the
previous period. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley traders incurred losses on 15 days during
the second quarter, with none exceeding $50 million, the New
York-based company said in an Aug. 6 filing. Bank of America
Corp., the second-largest U.S. lender, recorded trading losses
on three days in the quarter, with the biggest at $11 million,
the Charlotte, North Carolina-based firm said last week. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, cut its holdings of Italian
sovereign debt by 92 percent in the second quarter after
boosting them in the first three months of the year. </p>
<p>Market exposure to Italian government bonds fell to
$191 million at the end of June from $2.51 billion at the end of
March, the New York-based firm said in a quarterly regulatory
filing today. Goldman Sachs also increased its credit-derivative
positions on Italy in the quarter, pushing its total market
exposure to Italian government and non-government securities to
negative $977 million from positive $2.4 billion in March. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs discloses the firm''s credit and market stance
for Italy, Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain each quarter
because those five countries are viewed by investors as Europe''s
riskiest. The filing today showed that the firm''s total market
exposure to the five countries also swung to a negative $977
million as of June from a positive $2.68 billion three months
earlier as the bank reduced its position in bonds and stocks and
purchased more credit derivatives. </p>
<p>Credit exposure, which measures the risk from a default
or credit deterioration of the counterparty or borrower,
increased to $3.35 billion for the five countries from $2.52
billion in March, the filing showed. The jump reflected a boost
in the firm''s credit exposure to Spain to $1.67 billion from
$639 million in March, mostly from an increase in non-sovereign
exposure, the filing showed. </p>
<p>Derivatives include credit-default swaps, which act like
insurance to reimburse a bondholder when a borrower fails to
meet its obligations. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs disclosed that it had written a total of
$154.4 billion in notional credit derivatives for the five
countries as of June and had purchased $165.2 billion. The
company said that substantially all of the purchased
derivatives were from investment-grade counterparties that are
domiciled outside of those five European countries and are
collateralized with cash or U.S. Treasury securities. </p>

<p>JPMorgan restated first-quarter results after discovering
that traders in London may have been seeking to avoid showing
the full amount of the losses in a synthetic credit book
during the first quarter, the New York-based company said in a

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, raised its estimate for potential
losses from legal claims by 26 percent. </p>
<p>Reasonably possible legal costs are as much as $3.4
billion, the New York-based firm said today in a report on the
quarter that ended June 30, without giving specific reasons for
the jump. That compares with $2.7 billion three months earlier.
The estimate is the highest since the firm''s $3.4 billion
forecast for Dec. 31, 2010, which was the first time the firm
supplied a figure for potential legal expenses. </p>
<p>Banks started releasing estimates of possible losses after
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission told finance chiefs
in October 2010 that they should disclose such costs when
there is at least a reasonable possibility they may be
incurred, even if the risk is too low to require reserves. </p>
<p>The estimate doesn''t include potential losses from legal
matters that are at an early stage or where the firm can''t

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
relies on trading for more than half its revenue, posted losses
from that business on six days in the second quarter, down from
15 days in the same period last year. </p>
<p>The firm''s traders made more than $100 million on four of
the 63 days in the quarter ended June 30, compared with one day
in the year-earlier period, the New York-based company said in a
quarterly regulatory filing today. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, last
month reported its lowest first-half revenue since 2005 as
revenue from trading stocks, bonds and other securities dropped
6 percent from a year earlier. That followed a 21 percent
decline in trading revenue for all of 2011, the worst
performance since 2008. </p>
<p>Trading losses during the second quarter never exceeded
Goldman Sachs''s value-at-risk limit, a measure of how much the
company estimates it could lose in the securities markets in a
single day, according to the filing. Average daily value-at-risk
dropped to $92 million in the three months ended June 30 from
$95 million in the prior three months, the firm said on July 17. </p>
<p>While it''s just one measure of risk, $92 million is the
lowest it''s been since the third quarter of 2006, Chief
Financial Officer David A. Viniar said in a conference call with
investors and analysts on July 17. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), the sixth-biggest U.S. bank, said this week
its traders lost money on 15 days during the second quarter, up
from eight days a year earlier. Bank of America Corp., the No. 2
U.S. lender, reported last week that it had trading profits on
60 of the 63 days in the period. </p>

<p>The judge handling the Bernard Madoff
brokerage liquidation picked bankruptcy lawyer James L. Garrity Jr., the head of Morgan Lewis  Bockius LLP''s bankruptcy and
finance and restructuring practice, to mediate in trustee Irving Picard''s fight with California Attorney General Kamala Harris. </p>
<p>The two parties couldn''t pick a mediator from the register,
so he stepped in, said Judge Burton Lifland, who ordered Picard
and Harris on July 18 to follow the court''s mediation procedures
to try and resolve their dispute over whether California was
entitled to sue the estate of money manager Stanley Chais for
$270 million. </p>
<p>In January, the trustee sued Harris, alleging her $270
million lawsuit against the former Madoff investor''s estate
interfered with the collection of assets needed to help
compensate Madoff victims. The combatants portrayed their fight
in court filings as a clash between federal bankruptcy law,
which describes a trustee''s powers in fraud cases, and state
law, governing a state''s top law enforcer. </p>
<p>Garrity, a certified mediator for the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
for the Southern District of New York, was a bankruptcy judge
for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New
York from 1991 to 1999. Garrity was a partner at Shearman 
Sterling LLP until he joined Morgan Stanley last October. He has
also worked an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District
of New York, where he was promoted to chief of the Tax Unit
focusing on bankruptcy cases, according to the firm website. </p>

the OIG to continue its leadership as a strong and independent
voice within the Department of Justice on whistle-blower
issues, Horowitz said in a statement. </p>
<p>Horowitz, who was confirmed by the Senate in April, said
that in the short time he has been in the role he has seen the
benefits of whistle-blowers within the department. </p>
<p>The new position will have oversight over all of the
Justice Department whistle-blower complaints and will be
responsible for ensuring that the inspector general reviews and
responds to each one. The official also will monitor
investigations into retaliation claims and serve as the office''s
liaison to other agencies and outside advocacy groups. </p>

<h2>Litigation </h2>
<h2>Proskauer Represents Caritas in Bankruptcy Approval </h2>
<p>Caritas Health Care Inc., formerly the owner of Mary
Immaculate Hospital and St. John''s Queens Hospital in Queens,
New York, won the signature of the bankruptcy judge on an Aug. 3
confirmation order approving a liquidating Chapter 11 plan. The
hospitals filed for Chapter 11 reorganization on Feb. 6, 2009,
in Brooklyn. </p>
<p>Proskauer Rose LLP, which has advised Caritas since its
inception in 2006, represented Caritas. The Proskauer bankruptcy
team advising Caritas was led by New York partner Jeffrey Levitan, with assistance from New York partner Richard Zall. </p>
<p>Approved in March, the explanatory disclosure statement
told unsecured creditors they could expect a recovery of 1
percent to 3 percent. </p>
<p>The bankruptcy court approved the sale of both facilities
in November 2009. The purchaser, developer Joshua Guttmann, paid
$26.6 million. </p>
<p>Getting to confirmation has been a long and winding road
for Caritas, said Richard Zall, Proskauer partner and chairman
of its healthcare department. But the company has worked
diligently for more than three years to resolve its many claims
and issues in a way that satisfies its obligations to its
different creditor groups. </p>
<p>Caritas filed under Chapter 11 intending from the outset to
close and sell of the facilities. </p>
<p>Created by Wyckoff Heights Medical Center, Caritas
purchased the two hospitals in a bankruptcy sale in early 2007
from St. Vincent Catholic Medical Centers of New York. The price
was $3.5 million cash, $10 million in notes, and the assumption
of $26 million in liabilities. </p>
<p>Caritas'' chief restructuring officer said closing the
hospitals with bankruptcy court assistance was necessary because
the New York State Department of Health and the New York State
Dormitory Authority indicated that they no longer have the
ability to continue to subsidize Caritas'' operating losses. </p>
<p>The petition listed assets of $87.2 million against debt
totaling $188.3 million. St. John''s had 227 acute-care beds
while Mary Immaculate had 189. </p>
<p>The Caritas case is In re Caritas Health Care Inc., 09-
40901, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Eastern District of New York
(Brooklyn). The St. Vincent case was In re Saint Vincent
Catholic Medical Centers of New York, 05-14945, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Israel''s second-biggest bank is seeking damages for claims
including common-law fraud, fraudulent inducement and negligent
misrepresentation, according to court filing today in Manhattan.
The bank accuses JPMorgan of making material misrepresentations
in the offering materials for the investments. </p>
<p>Plaintiff did not know the true facts regarding
defendants'' misrepresentations and omissions in the offering
materials, and justifiably relied on those misrepresentations
and omissions, Bank Hapoalim said in the filing. Defendants''
wrongdoing has led directly to plaintiff''s damages, which
include loss of market value on the securities. </p>

yesterday. A final hearing is scheduled for Nov. 16. </p>
<p>The accord resolves a class action, or group lawsuit, filed
on behalf of 1 million cardholders. The settlement fund
represents about one-half of the up-front transaction fees
cardholders paid on their credit card loans, lawyers for

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is being
investigated by at least 11 state, federal and international
enforcement bodies as the bank struggles to contain damage from
a botched derivatives trade that cost it at least $5.8 billion. </p>
<p>Authorities in Singapore, Germany and Japan have joined the
list of agencies probing the largest U.S. bank''s trading errors,
the company said in a regulatory filing yesterday. The U.S.
Justice Department, Congress, Securities and Exchange Commission
and U.K. Financial Services Authority are among those examining
the bank, which could still lose as much as $1.7 billion more on
its credit derivatives portfolio, the company said. The bungled
trade may also make it more difficult to resolve other pending
reviews, the company said. </p>
<p>The firm expects heightened scrutiny by its regulators of
its compliance with new and existing regulations, the company
said. Regulators will more frequently bring formal enforcement
actions for violations of law rather than resolving those
violations through informal supervisory processes. </p>
<p>The bank reiterated it found material weakness within
its internal controls and financial reporting related to the
trade and, as a result, its initial first-quarter results
couldn''t be relied on. </p>
<p>Eight civil lawsuits have already been filed since the bank
initially disclosed problems in its synthetic credit derivatives
book on May 10, the bank said. The Justice Department and SEC
are also among agencies investigating the bank''s possible role
in an international bid-rigging scheme to manipulate the London
interbank offered rate, or Libor, the bank said. </p>

<h2>Compliance Policy </h2>
<h2>Online Investors May Gain Protections From U.S. Muni Regulator </h2>
<p>U.S. financial regulators, responding to the growth in
trading securities over the Internet, want to bolster
protections for investors buying municipal bonds through online
brokers. </p>
<p>The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, which drafts
regulations for the $3.7 trillion state-and-local bond market,
said yesterday said it may place new requirements on online
brokers, such as collecting information about investors, sending
out educational material and drawing up procedures for meeting
their obligations -- including those aimed at preventing
overcharging. </p>
<p>The municipal market is dominated by individuals seeking
tax breaks or safety of bonds sold by state and local
governments, which rarely default. Other bonds also backed by
specific revenue, including parking garage tickets or levies on
new housing developments, pose more risks to investors. </p>
<p>The board said the new rules would help individual
investors trading online understand the features and risks of
municipal securities. </p>
<h2>State Street Urges Futures Client Account Change After MF Global </h2>
<p>U.S. futures regulators seeking to bolster protection of
customer funds after the collapse of MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ) and
Peregrine Financial Group Inc. should allow clients to put
collateral in separate accounts at custody banks, according to
representatives of State Street Corp. (STT) </p>
<p>The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission should revoke
a policy enacted in 2005 that banned futures customers from
using the accounts, State Street, the third largest custody
bank, said in a presentation prepared for a discussion in
Washington on possible new regulations. The agency should allow
for so-called tri-party custody accounts between clients,
brokers and custody banks, according to the presentation. </p>
<p>Allowing such accounts would help protect customer margin
monies from misuse or fraud by the futures broker, without
impacting the clearinghouses'' access to necessary funds,
Charley Cooper, senior managing director of State Street Global
Markets, said in a statement yesterday before the discussion. In
tri-party accounts, futures brokers substitute their own
collateral to fully fund the clearinghouse while client money
remains at the custody bank. </p>

<h2>Compliance Action </h2>
<h2>SMBC Nikko Ordered to Improve Compliance After Banker Charged </h2>
<p>Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316)''s investment banking
unit was ordered to improve operations by Japan''s financial
regulator after a former banker was indicted for securities
violations. </p>
<p>The Financial Services Agency told SMBC Nikko Securities
Inc. to report on how it will bolster compliance by Aug. 17, the
regulator said in a statement in Tokyo today. The firm lacked
controls to monitor the executive''s actions during the time he
allegedly breached securities laws, according to the FSA. </p>
<p>The order is the second for Tokyo-based SMBC Nikko in four
months after it was told to beef up internal controls in April
following tips staff gave to clients on a public stock offering.
Japanese authorities are cracking down on insider trading after
leaks at brokerages including Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) eroded
confidence in the nation''s capital markets. </p>
<p>Former SMBC Nikko executive Hiroyoshi Yoshioka and another
individual were charged with violating the financial instruments
and exchange law on July 15, said a Yokohama district court
official, asking to speak anonymously in accordance with the
court''s policy. Japan''s banking watchdog earlier recommended
they be indicted for conspiring to buy shares of a company with
insider knowledge that it was a takeover target. </p>
<p>SMBC Nikko said this week it will cut President Eiji
Watanabe''s salary by 30 percent for four months in the wake of
the latest probe. The company will increase employees'' liability
for breaching compliance rules and boost monitoring of
communication between staff and clients, SMBC Nikko said. </p>
<p>We apologize for causing significant trouble to clients
and stakeholders, the firm said in a statement today. We
will carry out the improvement measures announced. </p>
<h2>Standard Chartered Fitness Key Shutdown Grounds in N.Y. Law </h2>
<p>New York''s financial-services regulator has grounds to shut
Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) in the state even if he accepts the
firm''s argument that it illegally laundered only a fraction of
the $250 billion he claims. </p>
<p>As the state''s top banking regulator, Benjamin Lawsky has
power to act in his discretion against any financial institution
he deems untrustworthy, according to the charter of his year-old
department. </p>
<p>Penalties he could impose include fines and the revocation
of the bank''s license to operate in the state. Lawsky is said to
be considering a settlement figure as high as $700 million,
according to person familiar with the case. That would match the
amount HSBC Holdings Plc set aside last month to resolve
allegations of similar behavior. </p>
<p>Since the Aug. 6 issuance of an order from Lawsky''s
Department of Financial Services threatened to revoke Standard
Chartered''s license, the bank has focused its defense on the
amount it laundered, saying it involved less than 1 percent of
the 60,000 Iranian wire transfers asserted by Lawsky. </p>
<p>Even if Standard Chartered''s position is legally sound, the
order''s disclosure of internal e-mails suggesting a conspiracy
to hide the identity of Iranian clients from regulators has
given Lawsky grounds to act when the two sides face off at an
administrative hearing Aug. 15, according to experts on both
sides of the Atlantic. </p>

<h2>Google Agrees to Pay $22.5 Million for Apple Browser Breach </h2>
<p>Google Inc. (GOOG) agreed to pay a record $22.5 million to settle
allegations by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission that it
breached Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s Safari Internet browser. </p>
<p>The fine, the largest ever the FTC has levied against a
company, represents the first by the agency for a violation of
Internet privacy as the agency steps up enforcement of
consumers'' online rights. </p>
<p>The FTC alleged that Mountain View, California-based Google
deceived consumers and violated terms of a consent decree signed
with the commission last year when it planted so-called cookies
on Safari, bypassing Apple software''s privacy settings, to track
users'' Internet browsing behavior. </p>
<p>Google has drawn regulatory scrutiny and pressure from
consumer advocates for the way it handles personal information.
The operator of the world''s largest search engine signed a
consent decree with the FTC last year to settle allegations that
it used deceptive tactics and violated its own privacy policies
in introducing the Buzz social-networking service in 2010. </p>
<h2>Nagai Vows to Put Insider Scandal Behind Nomura in Newspaper Ads </h2>
<p>Nomura Holdings Inc. Chief Executive Officer Koji Nagai
pledged in newspaper advertisements to avoid a repeat of the
leaks that led Japan''s biggest brokerage to lose underwriting
deals and cost his predecessor his job. </p>
<p>Nomura will make efforts to prevent a recurrence and to
strengthen internal controls further by carrying out improvement
measures thoroughly, Nagai said in the advertisement published
in nine major Japanese newspapers this morning. We will seek
to restore confidence by working together. </p>
<p>Nagai took office on Aug. 1 after Kenichi Watanabe resigned
to take responsibility for failing to prevent employees from
giving tips to traders on share sales the firm managed in 2010.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and JPMorgan Chase  Co. were among 12
securities firms operating in Japan that this week pledged to
improve how they guard client information. </p>
<p>We take this matter seriously and the entire firm is
working to regain the trust of the public, said Keiko Sugai, a
spokeswoman for Tokyo-based Nomura. </p>
<p>Nomura submitted a report to the Financial Services Agency
yesterday showing its progress on improving compliance, two days
before the deadline. The regulator penalized domestic brokerage
unit Nomura Securities Co. on Aug. 3. </p>
<h2>Goldman Says SEC Closed Probe of Firm After Threatening Case </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said U.S. regulators ended an
investigation of its role in selling $1.3 billion of mortgage-
backed securities and won''t sue the firm, reversing course after
investigators warned in February that they intended to recommend
legal action. </p>
<p>Securities and Exchange Commission lawyers told Goldman
Sachs on Aug. 6 that they no longer planned to pursue claims
against the bank, the New York-based company said yesterday in a
regulatory filing. The regulator had sent Goldman Sachs a so-
called Wells notice in February, which typically gives
recipients a chance to dissuade investigators from recommending
the agency authorize enforcement action. </p>
<p>The SEC''s investigation looked at disclosures during the
late-2006 offering of subprime residential mortgage-backed
securities underwritten by Goldman Sachs, according to the
firm''s filing. It didn''t elaborate on the SEC''s decisions. David
Wells, a spokesman for the firm, declined to comment on the
filing. </p>
<h2>EADS Unit Probed by U.K. Prosecutors Over Saudi Bribery Claims </h2>
<p>A European Aeronautic, Defence  Space Co. (EAD) unit in Britain
is being probed by U.K. prosecutors over allegations it paid
bribes to win a telecommunications deal with Saudi Arabia''s
royal family. </p>
<p>The investigation involves suspected payments to Saudi
officials from EADS''s GPT Special Project Management unit, David
Jones, a spokesman for the U.K.''s Serious Fraud Office in
London, said yesterday in a phone interview. </p>
<p>The contract was valued at 2 billion pounds ($3.13
billion), the Telegraph newspaper reported in May 2011, citing
statements to investigators by a former GPT employee. </p>
<p>Certain allegations have been made and these are being
properly addressed with our full and constructive engagement,
an EADS spokesman, who declined to be cited by name, said in a
statement. </p>
<h2>Leoni, Wire Harness Makers Probed by EU Over Antitrust Cartels </h2>
<p>Leoni AG and other makers of automotive wire harnesses are
being probed by the European Union for possible collusion in
multiple cartels. </p>
<p>The wiring unit of German wire and cable-maker Leoni is
cooperating with the European Commission, the company said
yesterday. The antitrust investigation, announced by the
regulator, is part of a crackdown on price fixing in the auto-
parts industry. The commission didn''t name the companies it is
probing. </p>
<p>Leoni will cooperate with the EU probe and provide
information and documents to clarify the issue, Bernd Buhmann, a
spokesman for the Nuremberg-based company, said in a telephone
interview. </p>
<p>We have not made any provisions for a possible fine, he
said. There were several inspections at our premises since
February 2010 and we do not know if they will continue or
intensify or are already completed. </p>
<h2>Courts </h2>
<h2>Cargill Must Pay Former Singapore Trader''s Bonus, Judges Say </h2>
<p>Cargill Inc., the biggest agricultural company in the U.S.,
must pay a former Singapore-based trader $1.74 million in
deferred bonuses, the appeals court in the Asian city ruled in a
49-page decision received yesterday. </p>
<p>Mano Vikrant Singh, who left Cargill in 2008, sued the
company claiming his bonus was wrongly forfeited. Singh, who was
paid a monthly salary of S$25,000 ($20,054), had a bonus of $3.2
million for the 2008 financial year, according to the ruling. </p>
<p>Cargill, which forbade some staff that left from continuing
a career within the financial or commodity-trading industries
for two years, sought to stifle competition with its
restrictions, Singh had said in his complaint. </p>
<p>Cargill, based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, had demanded that
Singh return confidential information he took from the firm, and
said he breached his contract by setting up Xangbo Global
Markets Pte. </p>
<p>The company said in a statement today it will abide by the
decision. </p>
<p>Philip Jeyaretnam, Singh''s lawyer, said the judgment
established that the restraint of trade doctrine doesn''t only
apply to outright prohibition of post-employment competition. </p>
<p>The case is: Singapore High Court and Mano Vikrant Singh v
Cargill TSF Asia Pte. OS103/2011. Singapore Court of Appeal. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc., the world''s biggest
drugmaker, took another step forward with a plan to spin off its
animal health unit, registering the initial public offering with
U.S. regulators </p>
<p>Pfizer has said it plans to sell as much as 20 percent of
the new company, to be called Zoetis Inc., to raise cash. The
New York-based drugmaker may enable current investors to swap a
portion of their Pfizer shares for stock in the new company.
Pfizer also could hold the stock for sale later. </p>
<p>The regulatory filing today moves to complete the final
announced piece of Chief Executive Officer Ian Read''s effort to
shrink Pfizer by selling and spinning off non-drug units, which
included the April sale of its infant nutrition unit for $11.9
billion to Vevey, Switzerland-based Nestle SA. </p>
<p>Pfizer fell less than 1 percent to $23.72 at the close of
New York trading. </p>
<p>The animal health unit generated $4.23 billion last year
from products used in livestock and pets. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Bank of America Corp. and Morgan
Stanley (MS) are acting as underwriters. </p>
<p>Juan Ramon Alaix will continue as Zoetis''s CEO, and Richard Passov will carry on as Chief Financial Officer. Frank D''Amelio,
Pfizer''s CFO, will be the chairman of the board of the new
company. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) raised $2.5
billion with five-year debt at its lowest fixed rate for that
maturity as the extra yield investors demand to own bank bonds
instead of government securities narrows to the least in a year. </p>
<p>The largest U.S. lender by assets issued the 2 percent,
senior unsecured bonds due August 2017 to yield 135 basis points
more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The bank''s $5 billion of 6 percent senior
unsecured notes maturing in January 2018 traded at 119.1 cents
on the dollar to yield 2.23 percent with a 154 basis-point spread 
on Aug. 10, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. </p>
<p>JPMorgan sold the new securities as relative yields on
corporate bank debt fall to 233 basis points as of Aug. 10, the
narrowest since August 2011, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data. Credit-default swaps linked to the New
York-based lender that''s struggled to stem losses on soured
hedges made by its chief investment office have dropped to 119.5
basis points today from a 2012 high of 171 in June. </p>
<p>We have been constructive on this credit through the
course of dealing with the CIO trading losses, and we continue
to view this firm as the premier domestic bank, Don Jones, an
analyst at Sterne Agee  Leach Inc., wrote today in a research
note. </p>
<h2>Swap Spread </h2>
<p>JPMorgan swaps were trading 91 basis points below the
average cost of default insurance for banks including Bank of
America Corp., Wells Fargo  Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. on Aug. 10, according to data
provider CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market. </p>
<p>The spread was 103 basis points April 4, before Bloomberg
News reported the bank had amassed a position in the Markit CDX
North America Investment Grade Index Series 9 that may have been
as much as $100 billion. JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said July 13 that the botched trades may saddle the bank
with a $7.5 billion loss. </p>
<p>The new bonds may be rated A2 by Moody''s Investors Service,
its sixth-highest grade, according to a person familiar with
offering who asked not to be identified citing lack of
authorization to speak publicly about the sale. Moody''s
downgraded JPMorgan two levels to A2 in June. </p>
<p>JPMorgan managed the sale of the new debt, which has the
lowest coupon among the firm''s fixed-rate, five-year bond issues
bigger than $100 million, Bloomberg data show. </p>

<p>Sales of longer-term bonds are
accelerating at a record pace in the U.S., with corporate
borrowers from Morgan Stanley to FedEx Corp. (FDX) each selling 30-
year debt for the first time in at least a decade. </p>
<p>Issuance of investment-grade bonds maturing in 30 years or
more totals $83.6 billion since year-end, already exceeding the
annual total in 2010 and 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Offerings are growing about six times faster than the
overall high-grade market. </p>
<p>Corporate treasurers are exploiting record-low borrowing
costs as the Federal Reserve says it will hold its target
interest rate at between zero and 0.25 percent through at least
late 2014. An average yield of 4.57 percent on investment-grade
securities maturing in 15 years or more is lower than the rate
borrowers paid in 2009 to raise funds due in one to three years. </p>
<p>Issuers are viewing it as maybe a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity to fund at the levels that they can in the long end
of the curve, Jonathan Fine, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s head
of investment-grade syndicate for the Americas in New York, said
in a telephone interview. Low Treasury yields are encouraging
issuers to layer in more longer-dated debt, he said. </p>
<p>While investors'' growing appetite for long bonds is a boon
to companies, demand is also helping to send duration, a measure
of securities'' price sensitivity to yield changes, to the
highest level in almost two decades for all investment-grade
debt, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. </p>
<h2>Enhanced Risk'' </h2>
<p>Investing in long-term debt with yields so low carries
enhanced risk, Alan Shepard, an analyst at Madison Investment
Holdings Inc., which oversees about $16 billion from Madison,
Wisconsin, said in a telephone interview. There might be some
parts of that story that don''t end well for investors. But if
you''re a corporate Treasurer, you''re doing what you''ve got to
do. </p>
<p>Elsewhere in credit markets, the cost of protecting
corporate debt from default in the U.S. rose, with the Markit
CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which investors use to
hedge against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, adding
0.5 basis point to a mid-price of 102.9 basis points as of 11:39
a.m. in New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The measure typically rises as investor confidence
deteriorates and falls as it improves. Credit-default swaps pay
the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt. </p>
<h2>Swap Spreads </h2>
<p>The U.S. two-year interest-rate swap spread, a measure of
debt market stress, decreased 1.22 basis points to 19.91 basis
points as of 11:38 a.m. in New York. The gauge narrows when
investors favor assets such as company debentures and widens
when they seek the perceived safety of government securities. </p>
<p>Bonds of UBS AG are the most actively traded dollar-
denominated corporate securities by dealers today, with 65
trades of $1 million or more as of 11:38 a.m. in New York,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. </p>
<p>Switzerland''s biggest bank priced $2 billion of 10-year,
7.625 percent notes at par on Aug. 10, Bloomberg data show. The
securities rose to 101.2 cents on the dollar as of 11:29 a.m. in
New York to yield 7.45 percent, Trace data show. </p>
<p>Sales of longer-dated investment-grade bonds this year
through last week rose 63 percent from the same period last
year, eclipsing issuance of $82.6 billion in all of 2011 and
$77.9 billion in 2010, Bloomberg data show. Offerings of all
maturities have climbed 11 percent this year to $660 billion. </p>
<h2>Target, PepsiCo </h2>
<p>U.S. investment-grade debt due in 15 years or later have
returned 10.5 percent this year, more than triple the gain of 3
percent by notes due in one to three years, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data show. The shorter-term obligations have
returned 14 percent in the past three years, compared with 51
percent for the longer-term debt. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), the lender downgraded two levels to Baa1 by
Moody''s in June, raised $2 billion with 6.375 percent notes on
July 19, its first fixed-rate 30-year debt since March 2002,
Bloomberg data show. On July 24, FedEx, the Memphis, Tennessee-
based operator of the biggest cargo airline, issued $500 million
of 3.875 percent bonds due in three decades, its first 30-year
offering since 1989. </p>
<p>Other companies selling bonds with a minimum 30-year
maturity in 2012 include pipeline operator Enterprise Products
Partners LP (EPD) with $1.85 billion. Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Target
Corp. (TGT) each issued $1.5 billion of the debt, and PepsiCo Inc. (PEP)
sold $1.35 billion, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<h2>United Technologies </h2>
<p>A May 24 United Technologies Corp. (UTX) offering of $3.5 billion
of 4.5 percent bonds due in 2042 signaled how much appetite
there is at the long end of the curve, Andrew Karp, head of
investment-grade syndicate for the Americas at Bank of America
Merrill Lynch, said in a telephone interview from New York. The
lender helped manage the sale. </p>
<p>The 30-year maturity from the Hartford, Connecticut-based
maker of Pratt  Whitney jet engines and Sikorsky helicopters
accounted for the largest portion of its $9.8 billion
transaction to help finance its acquisition of Goodrich Corp.
The bonds have climbed 14.5 cents from the issue price to 113.2
cents on the dollar to yield 3.8 percent as of Aug. 10, Trace
data show. </p>
<p>Yields on U.S. corporate debt with maturities of 15 years
or longer fell to a record low 4.42 percent on July 25, Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data show. That compared with 1.61
percent that day for debt due in one to three years, which
yielded more than 5 percent in July 2009. </p>
<h2>Fantastic Time'' </h2>
<p>It''s a fantastic time to put on 30-year debt, said
Barbara Mariniello, a managing director in debt capital markets
in New York at Barclays Plc, which helped Kraft Foods Inc. (KFT) sell
$2 billion of 5 percent, 30-year bonds in May. Lower yields are
giving companies the opportunity to push issuance out the
curve as long as possible, she said. </p>
<p>Corporate borrowing costs are falling to record lows with
the U.S. central bank holding interest rates near zero since
December 2008 to help spur economic expansion during the longest
recession since the Great Depression. </p>
<p>While the economy exited the recession in June 2009, the
recovery has faltered. U.S. forecasters have cut their outlook,
with the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia estimating gross
domestic product will increase at an annual rate of 1.6 percent
this quarter, down from the previous estimate of 2.5 percent.
The forecasters see GDP expansion of 2.2 percent in 2012, down
from 2.3 percent. </p>
<h2>Price-Sensitive </h2>
<p>Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said in a speech to teachers
last week that our economy is still in a fragile recovery
and the central bank is working to restore normal levels of
employment and growth. The Federal Open Market Committee said
Aug. 1 that it would provide additional accommodation as
needed to promote an improved job market. </p>
<p>Prices of longer-maturity bonds are more sensitive to
changes in current market yields than shorter-dated debt. An
equal rise in borrowing costs cuts more value from longer-dated
notes that pay a larger number of coupons. </p>
<p>The influx of long-term debt combined with record-low
yields helped pushed average modified duration on U.S.
investment-grade obligations to 6.82 years on Aug. 2, the
highest level since December 1993, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data show. The measure is up from 6.3 a year ago. </p>
<p>Given the fact that you''re starting off with this very
low yield, the reduction in price would be quite substantial

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world''s biggest computer-services provider, opened a
research lab in Nairobi, its first in Africa, as part of an
expansion to gain customers in the continent. </p>
<p>IBM, based in Armonk, New York, said today in a statement
that it''s setting up the unit to work with the Kenyan government
on developing local solutions for water shortages and traffic
congestion. The move also adds to its on-the-ground expertise to
help sell products and services to companies and governments
across the continent, Uyi Stewart, a researcher for IBM in New
York, who worked on the deal, said in an interview. </p>
<p>It gives us that innovative arm to leapfrog everybody
else when doing business in the country, Stewart said. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty, who is in Nairobi to
meet with President Mwai Kibaki and other government officials
today, is betting that growth markets like Russia, Brazil and
Indonesia can contribute toward 30 percent of revenue by 2015,
up from 22 percent last year. In Africa, IBM is present in more
than 20 countries, compared with four, two years ago. </p>
<p>There is big demand for increasing the level of
sophistication of all levels of life in the African countries,
said Takreem El-Tohamy, IBM''s general manager for the Middle
East, Africa and Pakistan, in an interview. There is big
development and big focus driven by political stability,
economic stability and a big social drive from rural areas to
cities. </p>
<h2>Develop Skills </h2>
<p>The Nairobi research unit is IBM''s 12th worldwide and is an
extension of its plan to train workers in Africa in an effort to
aid economic development on the continent and increase the
company''s customer base. IBM also has agreements to develop
skills in African nations including Ghana and Tanzania. </p>
<p>IBM didn''t disclose its investment in the Nairobi lab or
give projections for revenue from it. Its other research labs
are in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, China, India, Ireland,
Israel, Japan and Switzerland. </p>
<p>The company''s expansion in Africa is part of a drive to add
$20 billion in revenue by 2015. That goal includes winning
contracts to make cities and infrastructure more efficient
through data analysis and cloud computing. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein won dismissal of a suit in
which investors said the bank knew mortgage-backed securities 
it sponsored didn''t comply with underwriting standards. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge William Pauley in New York said in a
ruling today that plaintiffs'' allegations were conclusory
and lacked specifics. </p>
<p>The plaintiffs in the so-called consolidated derivative
suit include Michael Brautigam and the Retirement Relief System
of the City of Birmingham, Alabama. Those also named as
defendants included current and former Goldman Sachs executives. </p>
<p>The plaintiffs said Goldman Sachs breached its fiduciary
duty when it accepted Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP,
funds then failed to comply with conditions for accepting it. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs sponsored $162 billion worth of residential
mortgage-backed securities, knowing that the loans underlying
the securities were troubled, the plaintiffs claimed. The bank
then sold $1.1 billion worth of the securities to Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac, knowing the underlying loans were troubled. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs was also accused of knowing the securities
didn''t comply with underwriting standards because the banking
and securities firm had conducted due diligence on the loans. </p>
<p>Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment on the ruling. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs fell 35 cents to $103.26 at 4:15 p.m. in New

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) will allow
customers to house excess swaps and futures collateral in a
separate bank account as it seeks to reassure investors after
losses at MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ) and Peregrine Financial Group
Inc. </p>
<p>The new service will allow clients to automatically
aggregate excess margin at JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., the firm''s
insured deposit-taking unit, Emily Portney, head of agency
clearing, collateral and execution at the New York-based bank,
said in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>It''s certainly in response to client queries and more
emphasis on safekeeping of client money, Portney said. The
key is safety, operational efficiency and more choice for
clients in how their funds are protected and invested, Portney
said. </p>
<p>Futures brokerage customers at MF Global are still missing
$1.6 billion in segregated funds after the firm filed for
bankruptcy in October after bets on European sovereign debt,
credit ratings downgrades and the worst quarterly loss in the
company''s history unnerved investors. About $220 million in
segregated client money is unaccounted for at Peregrine after
founder and Chief Executive Officer Russell Wasendorf Sr. was
arrested July 13 after a suicide attempt and a signed confession
that he defrauded customers for 20 years. </p>
<h2>Under Attack </h2>
<p>JPMorgan''s decision shows how the brokerage model is under
attack, said Craig Pirrong, a finance professor at the
University of Houston. Benchmark interest rates near zero since
2008 had already put earnings pressure on the firms, also known
as futures commission merchants, or FCMs, and the missing money
at MF Global and Peregrine has jarred investors who thought
their assets were protected by segregation requirements under
the Commodity Exchange Act, he said. </p>
<p>It''s another illustration of the impending end of the FCM
model, Pirrong said. Futures brokerages earn money on customer
collateral by lending it out at higher rates than they pay to
the investor or by buying securities with it. Everything is
tilting against that old model, Pirrong said. </p>
<p>At MF Global and Peregrine, the excess customer money held
at the brokerages is what disappeared. Collateral backing trades
of MF Global customers that was held by CME Group Inc. (CME), as well
as Peregrine customer assets maintained by Jefferies Group Inc.,
were protected. </p>
<h2>Margin Calls </h2>
<p>Investors who trade futures or clear swaps often leave
extra collateral in their accounts to have it available if
needed for a margin call. This money exceeds what the
clearinghouse and the brokerage demand to keep the trades
active. </p>
<p>The JPMorgan service will draw unneeded money and
securities from however many clearing brokers an investor uses,
Portney said. It''s clearing-broker agnostic, she said. </p>
<p>The collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008
prompted many derivatives users to spread their clearing
business among several banks or broker-dealers to lessen the
risk of having to move all their accounts at once or open a new
one in a time of stress. </p>
<p>JPMorgan rose 0.9 percent to $37.33 as of 12:53 p.m. in New
York. </p>
<p>The new collateral treatment will also allow investors to
choose how to invest their excess margin because it''s held in a
depository bank account that the client will control, Portney
said. That''s different than in the current futures model, where
investment decisions are made by the brokerage and not the
investor, Pirrong said. </p>
<h2>CME Plan </h2>
<p>Banks are looking for services to sell to people, and
this can be one of them, he said. </p>
<p>CME Group, the world''s largest futures market, said last
month it''s considering a plan to hold all customer funds at
clearinghouses or other depositories in response to MF Global
and Peregrine. The exchange operator and clearinghouse owner
said any interest earned by the customer money would be returned
to the futures brokerages to maintain a key feature of how the
firms earn revenue, according to a letter to customers from
Executive Chairman Terrence Duffy and Chief Executive Officer
Phupinder Gill. </p>
<p>Duffy, testifying before Congress after the idea was
announced, said it will be controversial and perhaps have
disruptive consequences. He later said the proposal wasn''t
meant to disrupt how the futures industry works. </p>
<p>JPMorgan has combined clearing services across securities,
swaps and futures along with collateral management solutions and
agency execution under one unit. Previously, several different
parts of the bank had responsibility for the various asset
classes and products, Portney said. </p>
<p>The move is meant to help customers on both the buy side
and sell side deal with new requirements introduced by the Dodd-
Frank Act in the U.S. and similar regulations being developed in
Europe, she said. </p>

<p>The lawn was filled with Goldman
Sachs (GS) Group Inc. partners dressed in pink looking out on a pink
sunset. </p>
<p>Rows of Moet  Chandon Champagne bottles stood chilled. On
the buffet were dishes from Toy Restaurant in Manhattan and
Tutto Il Giorno in nearby Sag Harbor. </p>
<p>Plum TV LLC -- brought back into business by LXTV founders
Morgan Hertzan and Joseph Varet -- was filming. DJ Cassidy,
founder of DJs for Obama, was spinning. </p>
<p>It wasn''t the first time hedge-fund manager Richard Perry
and his designer wife, Lisa, opened their home in North Haven
for a cause. Still, their first paddle-board race and party to
benefit Breast Cancer Research Foundation already looked like
one of the most fun benefits on the East End. </p>
<p>I''m a little surprised that this got traction, said
Lisa Perry standing next to her pool in vintage Pucci. We
thought maybe we''d raise $200,000 and we''re close to $550,000. I
think it''s a combination of people being curious about North
Haven -- they want to see the property -- and it''s BCRF and
Maria Baum. In the end the party raised more than $615,000. </p>
<p>Baum, a former trader, had the idea for the event over
dinner with the Perrys a year ago. Richard Perry had introduced
her to paddle-boarding last summer. Baum wound up going out on
the water almost every day as she went through chemotherapy for
breast cancer. </p>
<h2>Bays'' Beauty </h2>
<p>I''d be really angry, and then I''d get absorbed in the
beauty of the bays, Baum said. I would come back so peaceful
and so energized that most people didn''t realize what I was
going through. </p>
<p>Maria and Larry Baum and the Perrys became the event co-
chairmen. Maria Baum tapped her contacts in finance, including
Goldman Sachs partners Heather Shemilt, Rebecca Shaghalian,
Stacy Bash-Polley and Michele Docharty, who designated Goldman
Sachs Gives as a lead sponsor and member of the host committee. </p>
<p>This backing early in the planning process helped set the
ambitious scope of the event, said Myra Biblowit, president of
the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. </p>
<p>Knight Capital Group Inc. (KCG) and Southfield Capital Advisors
LLC also supported the event. </p>
<p>At the party, Estee Lauder (EL) Inc. Chairman William Lauder
chatted with Harvard Business School professor Robert Kaplan,
while designers Donna Karan and Reed Krakoff caught up near the
Champagne bar. Darcy Miller, editorial director of Martha
Stewart Weddings, talked with Clifford Hudis of Memorial Sloan-
Kettering Cancer Center, who is the chairman of the BCRF
Scientific Advisory Board. </p>
<p>The paddle-board race had 60 competitors, many of them new
to the sport. </p>
<h2>I Fell'' </h2>
<p>Mary Scheerer, president of Sag Harbor Industries Inc.,
finished first in one of the races. </p>
<p>There was a lot of wind coming across the bay, Scheerer
said. I fell 10 feet from the finish line, but my closest
competitor fell more. </p>
<p>The Perrys'' home, which they call The Beach House,
wasn''t open, though one could steal a peek at the brightly
colored modern art inside. The grounds offered a Calder
sculpture, a Robert Indiana Love mosaic, large red and
yellow rings by Zhu Jinshi and a pink paddle board propped
against the poolside cabana, where the Perrys'' daughter,
Samantha, was seen talking with friends. </p>
<h2>Ranch Hand </h2>
<p>Navigator Group Inc. president Charles Stevenson''s son
Ryland Stevenson is back in the Hamptons after working as a
ranch hand, he said at a party he attended with his stepmom,
writer Alex Kuczynski. </p>
<p>Days at Middle Fork Lodge in Challis, Idaho, started at 6
a.m. and included lugging around hoses and sprinklers and
bailing hay. I listened to lively things to keep me going,
the University of San Francisco sophomore said, Stevie Ray
Vaughn, boogie music, Johnny Lang. As for the future: I''d
like to be a sports lawyer. </p>
<p>Meanwhile the guest of honor at the party, Gigi Levangie
Grazer, had just sat down with a psychic, who was on hand to
help Grazer celebrate her new novel, The After Wife, about a
44-year-old Santa Monica, California, widow. </p>
<p>The book is going to be a complete success and I''m going
to have five more children, said Grazer, who''s divorced from
film producer Brian Grazer; they had two boys, 8 and 12. And
five more marriages, one for each child. </p>
<p>She added: Every book will be made into a movie starring
Brad Pitt, George Clooney or Robert Pattison. </p>
<p>Christopher Burch, CEO of J. Christopher Capital, hosted
the party at his Southampton home, less than a mile from the C.

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) Smith Barney, the
brokerage venture of Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. (C), was
fined $450,000 after a trader amassed a $1.3 billion bet in
2009, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority records show. </p>
<p>The brokerage didn''t have enough controls in place to
detect that Jared Weinryt, 31, had breached his $116 million
trading limit as he made overnight bets on futures, Finra 
said this month. The trades led to losses for Morgan Stanley 
Smith Barney of about $14.9 million, according to Finra. </p>
<p>Regulators are pressing Wall Street to heighten risk
controls after multibillion-dollar trading losses at UBS AG and
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the collapse of MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ)
after a $6.3 billion bet on European debt, and Knight Capital
Group Inc. (KCG)''s $270 million loss caused by faulty software. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley Smith Barney detected the trading activity
by a former employee that occurred three years ago, stopped it
promptly, reported it to regulators, and has since added new
controls designed to prevent a reoccurrence, Christine Jockle,
a spokeswoman for the unit, said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>The brokerage employed Weinryt from 2006 to 2009, Finra
records show. He bought and sold futures, agreements to trade
assets at set prices and dates. Investors sometimes buy futures
as a bet on price fluctuations and sell them before the delivery
date. Weinryt traded in futures tied to U.S. sovereign debt and
Eurodollars, according to Finra. </p>
<h2>Market Turned </h2>
<p>Weinryt''s futures bets totaled about $744 million at the
end of the trading day on July 14, 2009, exceeding his $116
million limit, according to a document posted on Finra''s
website. His bets swelled to about $1.33 billion as he continued
trading overnight, the document shows. </p>
<p>The market turned against Weinryt the next morning and he
tried to reduce the bets, incurring losses, according to Finra.
The brokerage cut off Weinryt''s access to the trading system in
late morning on July 15 and liquidated the contracts by the next
day. Total losses were $14.9 million, Finra said. </p>
<p>The industry regulator suspended Weinryt from trading for
two months and fined him $7,500 earlier this year, records show.
He consented to the sanctions without admitting or denying the
findings, according to Finra. Weinryt declined to comment. </p>
<p>He now works in the institutional fixed-income sales
division of Palm Beach Gardens, Florida-based Kiley Partners
Inc., which trades securities including municipal bonds, U.S.
government bonds and corporate debt. </p>
<p>We were delighted to have an opportunity to employ a
smart and talented employee like Jared Weinryt, Chief
Executive Officer Michael Kiley said yesterday in a phone
interview. He does a great job for us and his clients. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley owns 51 percent of the Smith Barney
brokerage, which has more than 17,000 advisers and $1.74
trillion in client assets. Citigroup, the third-largest U.S.
lender, owns the rest and is in the process of selling an
additional 14 percent stake to Morgan Stanley. Both banks are
based in New York. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE)''s non-operating Quigley
Co. unit won permission to have creditors vote on a bankruptcy
plan that would bar most asbestos claims against the two
companies, as a judge said the issue of whether Pfizer bought
votes will be addressed later. </p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart Bernstein in Manhattan today
approved Quigley''s sixth reorganization plan draft after
objections that it won''t resolve whether Pfizer devised the plan
in bad faith and manipulated the bankruptcy for its benefit. </p>
<p>An issue that keeps resurfacing -- whether Pfizer''s actions
are just another attempt to buy the vote of asbestos
claimants -- will be addressed at a trial when Quigley seeks
final confirmation of its plan after a vote, Bernstein said. </p>
<p>His ruling may lead to an end to the seven-year Chapter 11
case over how the former maker of products for the steel
industry and its parent, the world''s largest drugmaker, will
resolve their liability for asbestos claims. </p>
<p>Under the draft plan, Pfizer would contribute assets to a
trust to cover claims that Quigley''s past products caused
asbestos-related injuries. </p>
<p>Asbestos claims against Quigley may total $4.45 billion
over 42 years, according to testimony cited by Bernstein in
September 2010, when he denied Quigley''s request to exit
bankruptcy under a prior plan. </p>
<p>At the time, the court found Pfizer''s proposed contribution
of $216.2 million wasn''t enough to pay asbestos claimants, who
may have fared better by suing the company under civil tort law. </p>
<h2>Pfizer''s Contributions </h2>
<p>Pfizer has since increased its contributions, and in March
2011 a committee formed by asbestos claimants settled with
Pfizer and will receive $800 million under the agreement. </p>
<p>The U.S. Trustee, an arm of the Justice Department that
oversees bankruptcies, objected to the current disclosure
statement, which describes how creditors would be treated.
Concerns raised by Bernstein in his September 2010 ruling still
haven''t been resolved, Tracy Hope Davis, the acting trustee,
said in court papers. </p>
<p>In that ruling, Bernstein found Pfizer wrongly
manipulated the voting process to assure confirmation of the
plan, and thereby gain the benefit of the channeling
injunction by giving some asbestos claimants incentives to
vote in favor of the plan, Davis said. </p>
<p>Under the bankruptcy code, channeling injunctions allow
companies to limit future liabilities by channeling them to a
trust. </p>
<h2>Victims'' Accords </h2>
<p>The current plan still doesn''t disclose whether settlements
Pfizer made with asbestos victims are consistent with historic
standards, and why asbestos claimants who settled their lawsuits
against Pfizer before Quigley''s bankruptcy have a right to vote,
Davis said. </p>
<p>It would only give some asbestos claimants 7.5 percent of
what they seek and block them from making future claims against
Pfizer under tort law, where they might get an estimated
23 percent of what they seek, Davis added. </p>
<p>Quigley, in bankruptcy since 2004, filed the sixth version
of its plan June 29. It addresses an April appeals court ruling
on how Pfizer can use Quigley''s bankruptcy to protect itself
from asbestos claims. The court found that law firm of Peter
Angelos can sue Pfizer based on manufacturer liability under
Pennsylvania law. </p>
<p>The new plan''s exception for claims under state law would
be null and void if the appeals court''s decision was modified on
rehearing or by the Supreme Court, Quigley said in the plan. </p>
<h2>Litigation''s Start </h2>
<p>Angelos began suing Pfizer in 1999, saying that because the
drug company''s logo appeared on Quigley products, it should have
liability for the asbestos-containing products. </p>
<p>Reaud, Morgan  Quinn LLP, a law firm that represents
asbestos claimants, objected, saying Pfizer is paying
$300 million more to the 40,000 claimants represented by the
committee than it paid 193,000 earlier, to settle the claims
of the most outspoken opponents of its reorganization plan. </p>
<p>Hissey Kientz LLP, a law firm which said it represents
3,200 claimants with diseases such as mesothelioma and lung
cancer, joined in Reaud Morgan''s objection. A committee of
unsecured creditors and Pfizer said they supported the current
disclosure statement. </p>
<p>Albert Togut, a representative for people who haven''t yet
manifested asbestos-related illnesses but will do so in the
future and bring claims against the trust, said in court papers
that he was still resolving issues with Quigley and Pfizer. </p>
<h2>Spokesman''s Statement </h2>
<p>Christopher Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said the company is
pleased with the court''s decision to approve Quigley''s
disclosure statement and looks forward to moving ahead with
the bankruptcy. </p>
<p>Quigley, founded in 1916, made three products for the steel
industry from the 1940s to the 1970s that contained asbestos.
Pfizer bought Quigley in 1968. The unit stopped most operations
in 1992 and filed for bankruptcy in 2004. </p>
<p>Pfizer has said it never made or sold any Quigley products.
Some claimants haven''t released Pfizer from alleged derivative
liability, according to the company. </p>
<p>Under the sixth amended plan, Pfizer will contribute
$260 million in cash to a trust that will pay most future
asbestos claims brought against it and Quigley. Pfizer will also
forgive a secured claim of $95 million against Quigley, a loan
of $19 million to Quigley, and an unsecured claim of
$33 million. It will contribute insurance benefits that cover
asbestos personal injury claims. </p>
<h2>Property''s Use </h2>
<p>Pfizer will also contribute a property leased to an Orange
County, California, Anheuser-Busch distributor to pay asbestos
claims. The property has an estimated value of $43.6 million and
produced cash flow of $1.9 million in the first 12 months since
Pfizer acquired it, according to court papers. </p>
<p>The committee of asbestos claimants asked in 2010 to have
the bankruptcy dismissed so it could bring tort claims, which
are otherwise blocked by bankruptcy law. </p>
<p>The U.S. Trustee also in 2010 asked the bankruptcy court to
end Quigley''s Chapter 11 case, citing the fact that creditors
alleging asbestos-related health issues have been unable to sue
New York-based Pfizer during the case, and many have died. </p>
<p>The case is In re Quigley Co., 04-15739, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The appeals
case is 11-2635, 11-2767, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the Wall
Street bank that generated 58 percent of first-half revenue from
sales and trading, eliminated 20 to 30 jobs in that division
this week, according to a person briefed on the matter. </p>
<p>The cuts affected salespeople and traders in the U.S., with
most taking place in New York, said the person, who asked not to
be identified because the reductions aren''t being announced
publicly. The decision is part of a continuous review of
staffing levels amid difficult markets, the person said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, said
last month that it plans to eliminate $500 million from annual
expenses, mostly from compensation, after reporting its lowest
first-half revenue since 2005. The cuts are on top of a $1.4
billion expense-reduction program that was completed earlier
this year. Goldman Sachs employed 32,300 people at the end of
June, according to a company press release. </p>
<p>We''re controlling the levers that we can, which are
expenses and capital, Chief Financial Officer David A. Viniar,
57, said on a July 17 conference call with analysts. We
obviously don''t want to go too far on either one because we
think that the world will get better. </p>

<p>Stronger U.S. economic data have
reduced the probability that the Federal Reserve will announce a
third round of so-called quantitative easing when policy makers
gather next month, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said. </p>
<p>We do not expect a move to QE3 at the Sept. 12-13
Federal Open Market Committee meeting, Jan Hatzius, chief
economist at Goldman Sachs in New York, wrote yesterday in a
note to clients, citing retail sales that rose more than
forecast in July. Economic growth probably accelerated, he said. </p>
<p>While QE3 at the September 12-13 FOMC meeting remains
possible, our best estimate is that it will take until late
2012/early 2013 before Fed officials return to balance sheet
expansion, Hatzius wrote. The U.S. economic recovery remains
sluggish, but we believe that it will pick up a bit in coming
months. </p>
<p>Additional asset purchases by the central bank are less
likely next month as strengthening retail sales and slowing
inventory accumulation by businesses signal that U.S. economic
data continue to look a bit stronger, Hatzius wrote. Economic
growth in the third quarter probably accelerated to 2.3 percent
from an earlier tracking estimate of 2.2 percent, the economist
said, citing Goldman Sachs estimates. </p>
<p>Although Fed officials clearly adopted a strong easing
bias at the July 31-Aug. 1 FOMC meeting, we do not think that
this amounts to a pre-commitment to QE3, Hatzius wrote.
Instead, we believe that continued weakness is necessary to
prompt a substantial easing move. And so far, that weakness is
not showing up in the data. </p>
<h2>Retail, Inventories </h2>
<p>Retail sales increased 0.8 percent in July, the biggest
gain since February and first gain in four months, the Commerce
Department said Aug. 14. A separate report the same day showed
that inventories at U.S. companies rose in June at the slowest
pace in nine months. </p>
<p>There is a very solid case for additional accommodation
under the Fed''s dual mandate of maximum employment and 2 percent
inflation, Hatzius wrote in the report published yesterday
after U.S. markets closed. We do believe that Fed officials
will ultimately decide to ease policy further. </p>

<p>General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP), the
second-largest U.S. mall owner, agreed to buy Pershing Square
Capital Management LP''s 14 percent stake in Brazil''s Aliansce
Shopping Centers SA (ALSC3) for about $195 million. </p>
<p>The purchase will increase General Growth''s interest in
Aliansce to 46 percent, the Chicago-based company said in a
statement today. It plans to fund the deal with available cash. </p>
<p>Aliansce, based in Rio de Janeiro, owns interests in 18
malls, three of which are under development, totaling about 6.5
million square feet (604,000 square meters) of leasable space.
Sandeep Mathrani, General Growth''s chief executive officer and a
member of Aliansce''s board, said on a conference call earlier
this month that his company was committed to increasing its
assets in Brazil, Latin America''s biggest economy. </p>
<p>The Brazilian landscape is under-retailed and the sales
productivity is very high, he said on the Aug. 2 call. It''s
long term a fantastic market for us to continue to grow. </p>
<p>The stock purchase from affiliates of Pershing, a New York-
based hedge fund run by William Ackman, is equal to 20 reais a
share, General Growth said. Aliansce shares closed yesterday at
19.20 reais in Sao Paulo. They have gained 35 percent this year,
compared with a 2.3 percent increase in the benchmark Bovespa (IBOV)
index. </p>
<p>General Growth is the largest U.S. mall owner after
Indianapolis-based Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG) It owns or has an
interest in 150 regional shopping malls. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s biggest
drugmaker, will add an over-the-counter version of AstraZeneca (AZN)
Plc''s heartburn pill to its stable of consumer products that
include the pain reliever Advil and the vitamin Centrum. </p>
<p>Pfizer has been looking to expand its consumer business,
which generated $3.01 billion last year. The New York-based
company last year discussed trying to get regulators to approve
a nonprescription form of Lipitor, its top-selling cholesterol
pill that lost patent protection in November. </p>
<p>AstraZeneca is trying to plot its strategy after the April
resignation of Chief Executive Officer David Brennan, who had
been criticized by investors for failing to bolster the London-
based company''s pipeline of experimental drugs. Pfizer has been
selling off its non-drug units and focusing on developing new
medicines. While it''s shedding its infant nutrition and animal
health businesses, Pfizer opted to keep its consumer business
that includes over-the-counter treatments. </p>
<p>To obtain the rights to an over-the-counter Nexium, Pfizer
paid AstraZeneca $250 million upfront with royalties from sales
once the pill enters the market in 2014, the companies said
yesterday in a joint statement. </p>
<p>Pfizer said the cost of the deal reduces its 2012 profit
forecast 2 cents a share, to a range of $2.12 to $2.22.
AstraZeneca boosted its annual earnings forecast 15 cents a
share, to $6 to $6.30. </p>
<p>With the deal, Pfizer is continuing to enhance the value
of our consumer health-care business, Ian Read, Pfizer''s
chairman and chief executive officer, said in the statement. </p>
<p>The Nexium deal may be the first of several such
partnerships, Pfizer and AstraZeneca said. Both are exploring
the potential for a strategic partnership that could include
similar agreements for other AstraZeneca prescription brands for
which OTC versions might be appropriate, the companies said. </p>
<p>Nexium was AstraZeneca''s third-biggest drug in 2011, with
$4.4 billion in revenue, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Nexium loses patent protection in the U.S. in 2014.
The agreement doesn''t change the sales rights for the
prescription version of the drug, which will stay with
AstraZeneca. </p>
<p>The over-the-counter version of the pill still has to be
approved by regulators, the companies said in their statement.
It could go on sale in the U.S. as soon as 2014, and other
markets afterwards. </p>

<h2>Trademark </h2>
<h2>Green Mountain Trademarks Rivo Name for Espresso Machine </h2>
<p>Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. (GMCR), which plans to
introduce an espresso maker this year to compete with Starbucks
Corp. (SBUX), registered Rivo as a trademark for a machine to make
such drinks. </p>
<p>The name Rivo, which means stream in Italian, was
registered by Green Mountain''s Keurig Inc. unit this year for
electric brewing and electric espresso machines, according to
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office website. Waterbury,
Vermont-based Green Mountain previously said it is working with
Luigi Lavazza SpA to develop an espresso maker. </p>
<p>We''ve not made a product announcement related to that
name, Suzanne DuLong, a Green Mountain spokeswoman, said in an
interview. </p>
<p>Green Mountain is facing more competition as grocers and
other manufacturers, such as Safeway Inc. (SWY) and Rogers Family Co.,
make private-label capsules to fit into Keurig machines. While
the main patents for K-Cups expire in September, Chief Executive
Officer Lawrence Blanford has recently started selling the more-
expensive Vue machine and single-serve cups. </p>
<p>The Rivo is another step to help Green Mountain combat
emerging rivals as it struggles to accurately forecast capsule
sales. Green Mountain''s espresso machine will likely compete
with Starbucks''s Verismo single-serve beverage maker, which will
be sold in the U.S. this year online, in some Starbucks cafes
and in specialty retailers. </p>
<p>Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz announced in March that the
Verismo would specialize in high-pressure, espresso drinks and
would also make brewed coffee. The Seattle-based company hasn''t
released pricing information for the Verismo. </p>
<p>Lavazza, based in Italy, owned 5 percent of Green Mountain
as of February 24, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Dick''s Sporting Goods Buys Some Rights to Field  Stream Marks </p>
<p>Dick''s Sporting Goods Inc. (DKS), the largest U.S. retailer of
athletic goods, said it will buy the rights to Field  Stream
magazine''s trademark in a number of categories. </p>
<p>The magazine, which was founded in 1895, focuses on outdoor
activities related to hunting and fishing.  According to a
statement from Coraopolis, Pennsylvania-based Dick''s, the rights
that were bought are for use of the mark in the hunting,
fishing, camping and paddle categories. </p>
<p>Previously the company had leased these rights from the
magazine since 2007. Now Dick''s is paying $25 million to own
them, according to the Dick''s statement. </p>

<h2>Copyright </h2>
<h2>Bulgari Accuses Kenneth Jay Lane of Copying Jewelry Designs </h2>
<p>Bulgari SpA sued Kenneth Jay Lane Inc., saying the New York
jewelry designer copies and imitates its rings and bracelets
without permission. </p>
<p>Rome-based Bulgari accused Kenneth Jay Lane, in a complaint
filed Aug. 13 in federal court in Manhattan, of copyright
infringement, design patent infringement and unfair competition.
The company, a unit of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC),
seeks a court order to end the sale of allegedly infringing
jewelry and unspecified damages. </p>
<p>Bulgari''s jewelry items consist of distinctive and
original designs, including design elements and features that
have become synonymous with Bulgari in the eyes of the public,
consumers and the luxury goods industry, the Italian company
said in the complaint. </p>
<p>Jonathan Wolfert, a lawyer who represents Kenneth Jay Lane
in a separate trademark infringement case, didn''t return an e-
mail or telephone call to his office seeking comment on the
Bulgari lawsuit. </p>

District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan.) </p>
<h2>Google Can Appeal Class-Action Status of Digital-Book Case </h2>
<p>Google Inc. (GOOG) can appeal the class-action status granted to a
lawsuit over digital books, a federal appeals court in New York
said yesterday. </p>
<p>U.S. Circuit Judge Denny Chin in New York, sitting as a
federal trial judge in the case, in May granted class-action or
group status to a series of plaintiffs, including the Author''s
Guild and the American Society of Media Photographers in
lawsuits over electronic books. </p>
<p>Chin also granted a request for three individual plaintiffs
to represent a nationwide class of copyright holders in the
Author''s Guild suit. </p>
<p>The appeals court yesterday granted Google leave to appeal
the class-action ruling while the case is still pending before
Chin. </p>
<p>In July, Google asked Chin to dismiss the Authors Guild
case, arguing that authors benefit from the project because
their books can be more readily found, bought and read, while
the public gains increased knowledge. Google also argued
that the display of snippets of text is fair use under copyright
law and that the authors haven''t been harmed by the display. </p>
<p>In his May ruling, Chin also rejected Google''s arguments
that the groups lacked standing to sue over claims the search
engine company''s digital scanning of millions of books infringed
the copyright owners'' rights. </p>
<p>Maggie Shiels, a spokeswoman for Google, declined to
comment on the court''s ruling. </p>
<p>The suits stem from Google''s plan, announced in 2004, to
digitally scan books from public and university libraries to
provide short excerpts of text to people who use its Internet
search engine. The Authors Guild, individual authors and
publishing companies sued in 2005, claiming the Mountain View,
California-based company hadn''t sought authorization from the
owners of the works. </p>
<p>Google has argued that the display of snippets of text is
fair use under copyright law. Chin asked Google today why it was
important at this stage of the case to determine the ownership
of the copyrights. </p>
<p>Google said in a February court filing that it has scanned
more than 20 million books, and that Web users can see excerpts
in English from more than 4 million of them. The project began
with the digitizing of books from the libraries of the
University of Michigan, Harvard University, Stanford University,
Oxford University and the New York Public Library. </p>
<p>The authors'' case is Authors Guild v. Google, 05-08136;

Photographers v. Google, 10-02977; U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Barclays
Plc (BARC) are among seven banks subpoenaed in New York and
Connecticut''s investigation into alleged manipulation of Libor,
according to a person familiar with the matter and company
filings. </p>
<p>Subpoenas were sent in recent weeks to Deutsche Bank AG (DBK),
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) in
addition to JPMorgan and Barclays, the person said yesterday.
Citigroup Inc. (C) and UBS AG (UBSN) received subpoenas earlier this year
as part of the investigation. </p>
<p>New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and Connecticut
Attorney General George Jepsen are jointly investigating alleged
manipulation of the London interbank offered rate by lenders.
RBS, UBS, Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) and Deutsche Bank are among
the lenders that regulators in Europe, Asia and the U.S. are
investigating. The U.S. is conducting a criminal investigation. </p>
<p>Confidence in Libor, a benchmark for financial products
valued at $360 trillion worldwide, has been dented by Barclays''
admission that it submitted false London and euro interbank
offered rates. Robert Diamond resigned as Barclays'' chief
executive office after the bank was fined 290 million pounds
($456 million). </p>
<h2>False Submissions </h2>
<p>Derivatives traders requested the false submissions in the
Libor and Euribor setting process, as they were motivated by
profit and sought to benefit Barclays'' trading positions, the
U.K. Financial Services Authority said. </p>
<p>The investigation by Schneiderman and Jepsen could broaden
to include additional banks, said the person. Jennifer Givner, a
spokeswoman for Schneiderman, and Jaclyn Falkowski, a
spokeswoman for Jepsen, declined to comment on the subpoenas. </p>
<p>Separately, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi''s office is
actively reviewing the Libor matter and has subpoenaed 14
banks, spokeswoman Jenn Meale said. In addition to the seven
institutions in the New York and Connecticut probe, Florida
subpoenaed Bank of America Corp., Societe Generale SA (GLE), Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN), Credit Agricole SA (ACA), Royal Bank of Canada,
Rabobank Groep and Lloyds Banking Group. </p>
<p>Sarah Binnie, a spokeswoman for Edinburgh-based RBS, said
the bank continues to receive requests from various regulators
investigating the setting of Libor and other interest rates. The
lender is cooperating with the investigations and keeping
relevant regulators informed, she said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>It is not possible to estimate with any certainty what
effect these investigations and any related developments may
have on the group, Binnie said. </p>
<h2>Information Requests </h2>
<p>Kathryn Hanes, a spokeswoman for Frankfurt-based Deutsche
Bank, said the lender has received subpoenas and requests for
information from some regulators and governmental entities in
the U.S. in connection with setting interbank rates and is
cooperating. </p>
<p>New York-based Citigroup said in a regulatory filing that
subsidiaries have received additional requests for information
and documents from various U.S. and non-U.S. governmental
agencies, including the offices of the New York and Connecticut
attorneys general. </p>
<p>UBS, based in Zurich, said in a regulatory filing that
numerous agencies, including various state attorneys general
are investigating whether there were improper attempts to
manipulate Libor and other rates. A second person familiar with
the matter said the bank received a subpoena from New York in
February. Both declined to comment because the matter is
private. </p>
<h2>Regulatory Demands </h2>
<p>Nicole Sharp, a spokeswoman for London-based Lloyds Banking
Group, said the company is assisting various regulators in their
investigations. Royal Bank of Canada (RY) spokeswoman Katherine Gay
said the bank is also cooperating with regulators. </p>
<p>We did not find any evidence of collusion with other
banks, and we have determined that our Libor submissions
reflected our perception of our cost of funds, Gay said in an
e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>London-based HSBC said in a 2012 interim report that it is
the subject of regulatory demands for information and is
cooperating with the investigations. </p>
<p>Representatives of the other institutions couldn''t be
reached for comment or declined to comment. </p>
<p>Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley''s office said
in July it was also conducting a Libor investigation and was
working with other state agencies. </p>
<p>Libor is derived from a survey of banks conducted each day
on behalf of the British Bankers'' Association in London. Lenders
are asked how much it would cost them to borrow from one another
for 15 different periods, from overnight to one year, in
currencies including dollars, euros, yen and Swiss francs. After
a set number of quotes are excluded, those remaining are
averaged and published for each currency by the BBA before noon. </p>

<p>Lester R. Brafman, a managing
director in the high-yield debt sales and trading department at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), left this week after 11 years at the
firm, according to five people familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>Brafman, 50, joined New York-based Goldman Sachs in 2001
after six years at Credit Suisse First Boston Inc., according to
records maintained by the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. He previously worked at Wasserstein Perella
Securities Inc. and Lehman Brothers Inc., the records show. </p>
<p>Brafman ran high-yield debt trading at Credit Suisse and
had a similar role after joining Goldman Sachs. He''s been a
Goldman Sachs managing director, the second-highest rank at the
firm, after partner, since 2003. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which generated 58 percent of first-half
revenue from sales and trading, eliminated 20 to 30 jobs in that
division this week, a person familiar with the matter said
yesterday. The firm last month reported its lowest first-half
revenue since 2005 and said it would cut $500 million from
costs, on top of $1.4 billion in savings already achieved. </p>
<p>Sales of high-yield debt in the U.S. have already set a
record for August as companies tap into an unprecedented $44.9
billion of cash that has poured into funds that buy junk bonds
in 2012. Yields that are near record lows and a slowdown in
earnings growth have sparked concern that the market for the
debt has peaked. </p>
<p>Michael DuVally, a spokesman at Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment on Brafman''s departure. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley bought a cargo of
Forties crude at a higher premium than the previous trade. Vitol
Group failed to sell Russian Urals and Nigerian Escravos grades
for a second day. </p>
<p>Angola, Africa''s second-largest oil producer, will increase
its crude exports in October to 54 cargoes, three more than next
month, according to a preliminary loading program obtained by
Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>North Sea </h2>
<p>Phillips 66 sold the Forties cargo at a 40 cents a barrel
premium to Dated Brent for loading on Sept. 2 to Sept. 4,
according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Platts trading window. That compares with a trade
done on Aug. 14 at 20 cents above the benchmark. </p>
<p>Mercuria Energy Trading SA and Total SA both bid for one
lot of the blend for loading on Sept. 5 to Sept. 7 for a second
day. Mercuria was seeking to buy at a premium of 40 cents to
Dated Brent, down from 50 cents yesterday. </p>
<p>Royal Dutch Shell Plc failed to sell a shipment of the
grade for a fourth day. The company offered a cargo for loading
on Aug. 30 to Sept. 1 at 20 cents less than Dated Brent. That
compares with a 10 cents premium in the previous session. </p>
<p>Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Before the session,
Forties loading in 10 to 25 days was at 29 cents a barrel more
than Dated Brent, down from a premium of 31 cents yesterday,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Brent for September settlement traded at $115.98 a barrel
on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, up from $115.12 yesterday. The contract expires later
today. The more actively traded October contract was at $114.30,
narrowing the discount to September to $1.68 from $1.85 in the

<h2>Mediterranean/Urals </h2>
<p>Vitol failed to find a buyer for 100,000 metric tons of
Urals at parity to Dated Brent for loading on Aug. 28 to Sept.
1, the survey of Platts showed. The company offered at 15 cents
more than Dated Brent yesterday. </p>
<p>No bids or offers were made for the blend in the
Mediterranean. The grade fell 4 cents to 63 cents a barrel more
than Dated Brent in the region, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Russia will ship 12 Urals cargoes of 100,000 tons each from
the Baltic Sea port of Primorsk from Aug. 31 to Sept. 6, a
partial loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed. </p>
<p>Shipments from the Baltic port of Ust-Luga will be four
consignments of 100,000 tons each over the same period,
according to the schedule. </p>
<p>Russia will also export two lots of 140,000 tons and four
80,000 ton shipments of crude from Novorossiysk on the Black Sea
from Sept. 1 to Sept. 6. One of the 80,000 ton shipments will be
Siberian Light grade and the other lots will be Urals. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) cut its 2012 forecast
for emerging-market stocks amid concern the global economy will
grow less than estimated and after the benchmark gauge rallied
as much as 11 percent from this year''s low in June. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley reduced its year-end estimate for the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index by 7 percent to 1,130, compared with
1,210 previously. The target still implies a gain of about 16
percent from the current level. The brokerage also cut its
targets for the MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index by 6
percent to 500, and the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index by 9
percent to 12,200. </p>
<p>The MSCI Emerging Markets Index rose to a three-month high
of 979.28 on Aug. 9, an increase of about 11 percent from the
gauge''s June 4 low, amid optimism that central banks will
introduce new stimulus measures. The gauge fell 0.1 percent to
973.08 as of 1:50 p.m. in Hong Kong today. </p>
<p>We take some profits after the recent rally and scale
back our fully invested overweight equities position, raising
cash from zero to 4 percent, Morgan Stanley analysts led by
Jonathan Garner wrote in a report today. The brokerage recently
cut its 2012 and 2013 growth estimates for China and South Korea
along with major advanced and emerging economies. </p>
<p>The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has advanced 6.2 percent
this year, compared with an 8.1 percent gain by the MSCI World
Index (MXWO) of developed countries. The emerging-markets gauge trades
at 10.8 times estimated earnings, compared with 13 for the
developed-nations measure, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley this week cut its 2012 growth forecast for
China to 8 percent from 8.5 percent previously, and 2013
estimate to 8.6 percent from 9.0 percent, citing stronger
headwinds from external demand. It also lowered its 2012
growth estimate for South Korea to 2.8 percent from 3.2 percent. </p>
<h2>Europe, Food Risk </h2>
<p>Government data last week showed that Chinese exports grew
1 percent in July, missing the 8 percent median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Foreign direct investment in
China dropped 8.7 percent last month from a year earlier to
$7.58 billion, the Ministry of Commerce said today in Beijing. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley said it''s concerned about event risk in
September as Germany''s Constitutional Court is set to rule on
the future European bailout fund on Sept. 12 as well as rising
risks from global food prices. The 21 nations in the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index send about 30 percent of their exports to
the European Union on average, data compiled by the World Trade
Organization show. </p>
<p>A global food crisis may hit us very soon as a drought
ravages corn crops in the U.S., the world''s largest grower, the
International Food Policy Research Institute said. The price of
corn, used in everything from food to livestock feed to
sweeteners, surged to a record $8.49 a bushel on Aug. 10. </p>

version of an inspector general''s report obtained today through
a Freedom of Information Act request. </p>
<p>Ward''s fate awaits a decision by Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. Since leaving Africa Command last year, Ward has served
as a special assistant to the Army''s vice chief of staff,
according to Army spokesman George Wright. Wright didn''t
immediately respond to a request for comment from Ward. </p>
<p>In an April 23 letter to the inspector general that was
cited in the report, Ward denied wrongdoing, saying the disputed
trips involved official business for Africa Command. </p>
<p>The inspector general''s investigation found Ward spent
public money on trips to New York City in 2010 and Atlanta in
2011 when the primary purpose was personal, in violation of
federal guidance and military policy, according to the report,
which was dated June 26. </p>
<h2>Wife''s Travels </h2>
<p>The inspector general found Ward allowed his wife to
accompany him on military aircraft 15 times for purposes that
were not unquestionably official and without reimbursing the
U.S. Treasury. </p>
<p>The statement that my wife sat someone down and said to
make provisions to take her on every trip is an obvious
misrepresentation and character assassination, Ward wrote.
The portrayal in the allegations that we were hunting'' for
reasons for my wife to travel is so misleading as to be false. </p>
<p>The inspector general found Ward permitted his staff to
rent cars at government expense to run personal errands and to
drive Mrs. Ward for unofficial purposes, such as to a spa and a
department store, in violation of federal travel regulations,
according to the report. </p>
<p>Ward described the spa trip as likely a case of stopping
off to purchase hair or other grooming products for a family
member in Stuttgart or on the continent, according to his
letter. </p>
<p>It was certainly not as characterized, a day trip to the
spa for personal reasons, the general said. </p>
<p>The inspector general stood by the conclusion, saying
Ward''s wife went to an appointment'' at a spa. </p>
<h2>Broadway Tickets </h2>
<p>The inspector general found the 2011 trip to Atlanta and
the use of a $700 hotel suite in Bermuda during a refueling stop
in May 2010 showed Ward failed to comply with requirements to
protect and conserve resources and to exercise prudence in
travel. </p>
<p>Ward accepted complimentary meals and Broadway show
tickets in excess of $20 in value for himself and his wife from
a prohibited source with multiple DoD contracts, in violation
of ethics rules, the report found. The name of the prohibited
source was blacked out. </p>
<p>Ward said in his letter that he didn''t know the source
had business dealings in the defense contract environment and
was therefore a prohibited source.'' </p>
<h2>Annual Party </h2>
<p>The report also found Ward spent more than $34,000 a year
on a one-day holiday party held at his residence in 2009 and
again in 2010. Ward brought a protocol specialist from the
U.S. to Stuttgart, Germany, where Africa Command is based, for a
month to help organize the party, according to the report. </p>
<p>Ward said use of the specialist supported a training
program and execution requirement for a very important official
function. </p>
<p>The general served as head of Africa Command, the newest of
six regional geographic commands, from Oct. 1, 2007, to March 9,
2011. </p>
<p>Panetta is reviewing a variety of disciplinary measures for
Ward, with nothing ruled out, according to an Army official who
spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn''t authorized to
speak publicly about the confidential investigation. </p>
<p>The inspector general called in the report for Army
Secretary John McHugh to take appropriate action on Ward and
conduct additional analysis to determine whether he should
reimburse the government for unofficial travel on military
aircraft. McHugh also should determine whether Ward should
reimburse the government for travel expenses that exceeded
government limits, according to the report. </p>
<p>As head of Africa Command, Ward was a four-star general,
the highest rank in the Army. He is considered a two-star
general in his current position, though no decision has been
made on the rank at which he will retire, the official said. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) raised 1.5
billion euros ($1.85 billion) from its first bond sale in the
currency for more than a year as investors seek to diversify
risk by purchasing non-euro region assets. </p>
<p>The largest U.S. bank priced the 10-year bonds to yield 100
basis points more than the mid-swaps rate, according to a person
familiar with the deal. The notes were initially marketed with a
110 basis-point spread. </p>
<p>The New York-based lender followed Wells Fargo  Co.
and Procter  Gamble Co. in tapping European investors seeking
haven assets. JPMorgan last sold 1 billion euros of 3.75 percent
bonds on June 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>It offers a way to increase exposure to non-European
risk, like the recent Wells Fargo deal, said Gregory Turnbull Schwartz, an Edinburgh-based fund manager at Kames Capital,
which manages about 50 billion pounds ($78.5 billion) of assets. </p>
<p>The cost to swap euros for dollars is near the lowest in
three months, according to the 10-year cross-currency basis
swap, making it attractive for issuers to sell bonds in the
common currency. The swap was 32 basis points below the euro
interbank offered rate, or Euribor, at 12:24 p.m. in London,
approaching the lowest since May 11. </p>
<p>JPMorgan arranged the deal. Kate Haywood, a London-
based spokeswoman for the bank, declined to comment. </p>

<p>A shortage of injectable drugs in
the U.S. means India''s Strides Arcolab Ltd. (STR) could sell a
division that makes generic cancer treatments and antibiotics
for more than the entire company''s market value. </p>
<p>Strides, which has seen its market capitalization double to
48 billion rupees ($832 million) this year, may sell its Agila
Specialties unit, three people with knowledge of the matter said
last week. A multiple of 18 to 20 times earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization would represent a
fair price for Agila, Ernst  Young LLP said, meaning the
division could fetch at least $1.35 billion, according to data
and analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The Bangalore-based company is considering the sale as
large drugmakers seek acquisitions to offset a potential decline
in revenue this year of more than $21 billion due to U.S. patent
expirations in 2011 and 2012. The global market for so-called
generic steriles may swell to $17 billion by 2020, according to
Citigroup Inc., even as a crackdown on manufacturers by U.S.
regulators has added to a shortage of injectable drugs. Agila
may be attractive to large global drugmakers looking to expand
in injectable medicines, including Hospira Inc. (HSP), according to
Centrum Broking Ltd. </p>
<p>Agila is a very valuable asset today, more than at any
other time, said V. KrishnaKumar, a Mumbai-based mergers and
acquisitions partner at Ernst  Young, who named Pfizer Inc. (PFE) as
a possible buyer of Agila. Sterile injectable deals tend to be
expensive because the assets are specialized. Large
pharmaceutical companies looking to expand their generics
portfolios should be interested in Agila. </p>
<h2>Profit Surge </h2>
<p>Today, Strides rose 3 percent to a record 818.3 rupees. The
gain was the biggest in the 17-company BSE Healthcare Index. </p>
<p>The company on Aug. 9 denied it was considering selling
Agila after Bloomberg News reported the plan. In a statement,
Strides said it would inform the stock exchange as and when
there is any such development. Chief Executive Officer Arun Kumar yesterday declined to comment further. </p>
<p>The company hasn''t approached potential acquirers yet,
three people said last week, asking not to be identified as the
information is private. </p>
<p>Pfizer said in an e-mail that it doesn''t comment on
speculation. Dan Rosenberg, a spokesman for Hospira, said the
company doesn''t comment on market speculation, when asked
whether it was interested in acquiring Agila. </p>
<p>Started in 1990 by Kumar and K.R. Ravishankar, Strides
began manufacturing injectable drugs five years later and
entered the U.S. market for sterile products in 2004. The
business was renamed Agila in 2010 and reported Ebitda of 2.7
billion rupees last year, accounting for more than half of
Strides earnings, according to a company presentation in May. </p>
<h2>FDA Approval </h2>
<p>The company''s total profit will more than quadruple to 10.2
billion rupees this year, according to the average of eight
analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Agila''s sales will
jump 47 percent in 2012 to 13.3 billion rupees as it benefits
from the shortage of injectable drugs in the U.S., Fortune
Equity Brokers Ltd. said. </p>
<p>This business is doing well, because manufacturing
capacity is in short supply, said Ajit Kumar Jain, joint
managing director of Ipca Laboratories Ltd., the world''s biggest
maker of anti-malarial drugs, which is building its own
injectable-medicines plant. Strides has good capacity and new
facilities. </p>
<p>After an antibiotics plant in Brazil was given U.S. Food
and Drug Administration clearance in February, and Agila
acquired another plant in southern India in April, the company
has seven facilities with FDA approval to make injectable drugs. </p>
<h2>Powerful Drugs </h2>
<p>The expense of building such sites makes Agila a more
attractive acquisition target for a buyer seeking to expand in
that area, said Hitesh Mahida, a Mumbai-based analyst at Fortune
Equity. </p>
<p>It takes three to four years to set up a plant, Mahida
said in a telephone interview from Mumbai. In order to
manufacture cancer injectables, you also need a high degree of
automation. </p>
<p>Injectable drugs include powerful antibiotics and
chemotherapy agents that are mostly used in hospitals. As more
drugs lose patent protection, the global market for generic
injectable medicines will swell 42 percent to $17 billion by
2020, according to a May 9 report from Citigroup. </p>
<p>Agila this month received FDA approval for oxaliplatin, a
cancer treatment. The drug will be distributed in the U.S.
through a two-year-old partnership with Pfizer, the world''s
biggest drugmaker. </p>
<h2>Manufacturing Crackdown </h2>
<p>A crackdown by the FDA on manufacturing practices at
steriles plants, including Lake Forest, Illinois-based Hospira,
in the past two years has contributed to a shortage in U.S.
hospitals. </p>
<p>There are 215 drugs currently in short supply, most of
which are injectables, according to a list on the American
Society of Health-System Pharmacists website. The shortages,
which involve anesthetics, treatments for cancer, and drugs
needed for emergency medicine, prompted the U.S. government last
month to tighten requirements on drugmakers to warn of potential
shortfalls, according to the FDA. </p>
<p>The crackdown ensnared India''s Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. and
Claris Lifesciences Ltd. (CLAR), as well. That places Agila in a
unique position as the only manufacturer of high-quality sterile
injectables from India, said Ernst  Young''s KrishnaKumar in a
telephone interview. </p>
<p>Claris said yesterday in a stock exchange filing that it
has addressed the FDA''s complaints. Its shares surged 20 percent
in Mumbai trading yesterday and climbed 5.1 percent today. </p>
<h2>Big Pharma </h2>
<p>Strides is considering a sale while global drugmakers trawl
India for potential acquisitions to offset a decline in revenue
from expiring patents, according to Ajay Argal, head of Indian
equities at Baring Asset Management Ltd. </p>
<p>All the big pharmas are finding it tough to have any
growth, so they have to look at areas where they are not
present, said Argal, who manages the Baring India Fund, said
in a telephone interview from Hong Kong. They have a lot of
cash, so rather than just keeping it in the balance sheet or
returning it to shareholders, they''re trying to elongate the
life cycle of their business with acquisitions. </p>
<p>Any buyer could immediately start generating sales because
Agila has ready-made facilities with all the necessary
approvals, said Ranjit Kapadia, a pharmaceutical analyst at
Centrum Broking. The most likely buyers would be companies
already selling injectable medicines, such as Hospira, said
Kapadia. </p>
<h2>Pfizer''s Cash </h2>
<p>Pfizer, which is based in New York, had $24.3 billion of
cash and short-term investments as of July 1, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Pfizer CEO Ian Read said in an interview
last month that the company''s willingness to do deals
externally is driven by the value of the deals. </p>
<p>Agila will generate Ebitda in 2012 of 4.19 billion rupees,
or about $75 million, according to analysts'' estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. A sale at 18 to 20 times Ebitda would be in line
with average multiples paid in recent purchases of injectable
drugmakers, according to KrishnaKumar. That implies the business
would fetch at least $1.35 billion. </p>
<p>At this price, a deal would be fairly priced, he said. </p>
<p>Foreign acquirers of Indian pharmaceutical assets have paid
a median of almost 27 times Ebitda during the past five years,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Strides sold its Australian and Southeast Asian unit,
Ascent Pharmahealth Ltd., to Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. for
A$375 million ($393 million) in January. Since then, the shares
have risen 71 percent. </p>
<h2>Piramal Sale </h2>
<p>Strides wouldn''t be the first Indian generic drugmaker to
fetch more for a unit than equity investors were willing to pay
for the whole company. In 2010, when Abbott Laboratories (ABT) bought
Mumbai-based Piramal Healthcare Ltd.''s branded generic-medicine
unit for $3.72 billion, it paid more than Piramal''s entire
market value of $2.5 billion. </p>
<p>The acquisition, which turned Abbott into India''s largest
drugmaker and gave it a vast portfolio of generic drugs,
highlights the motives of global pharmaceutical companies, said
Prashant Nair, a Mumbai-based analyst at Citigroup Inc. </p>
<p>Abbott was desperate to grow its presence in India, he
said in a telephone interview. The equity investor focuses on
factors like growth and profitability, but would not pay an
ownership premium. For a big pharma company, however, the motive
is largely strategic and they would be willing to pay more to
get ownership of a local entity to acquire a footprint that may
be difficult to develop organically. </p>
<h2>Arun Kumar </h2>
<p>Still, selling the unit would leave Arun Kumar, Strides''s
co-founder and owner of 28.3 percent of the company, without the
company''s most profitable business and the source of half of its
Ebitda. </p>
<p>It''s difficult to understand what will be left if they
sell this business, said Siddhant Khandekar, an analyst at
ICICI Direct. The rest of the business is just a plain vanilla
generic business that has no spark. I don''t think Arun will
sell. </p>
<p>That won''t be a problem if the price is high enough, said
Centrum Broking''s Kapadia. After Piramal agreed to sell its
branded generics unit, which accounted for more than half of the
drugmaker''s total revenue, the company paid a special cash
dividend. The company controlled by billionaire Ajay Piramal has
since been on an acquisition spree, buying a stake in Vodafone
Plc.''s Indian unit, a diagnostics portfolio from Bayer AG and
the health-care research provider Decision Resources Group LLC. </p>
<p>Like it happened with Piramal, if the valuation is good,
they will sell, he said. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. lender by assets, sold $1.1 billion of perpetual preferred
shares, more than double what it had planned, after selling $2.5
billion of bonds earlier this month. </p>
<p>The bank issued $25 shares, callable after five years, to
yield 5.5 percent, Bloomberg data show. The offering was earlier
marketed at $500 million, according to a person familiar with
the transaction. </p>
<p>We have seen financials hit the market more aggressively
recently, Marc Pinto, head of corporate bond strategy at
Susquehanna International Group LLP, said in a telephone
interview. It has been a particularly active market as of late
for preferreds. </p>
<p>JPMorgan last issued benchmark dollar-denominated debt on
Aug. 13, selling 2 percent, five-year bonds to yield 135 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The debt traded at 99.68 cents on the
dollar to yield 2.07 percent on Aug. 17, according to Trace, the
bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. </p>
<p>Banks are selling preferred shares in part to get ready for
changes in capital regulations linked to the Basel III
international banking requirements, Pinto said. There has been
$7.5 billion in $25 per share preferred issuance over the past
six weeks, according to Pinto. </p>
<h2>Basel III </h2>
<p>The Basel III guidelines, which will be phased in from 2013
to 2019, call on regulators to boost capital requirements for
banks, limit what instruments count toward capital and force
banks to rely more on equity than debt funding. </p>
<p>Rates are extremely low so it''s a very attractive market
for them to issue in, Pinto said. Investors are looking for
yield, and it''s very hard to find these days, so a number of
people are going to the preferred market. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo  Co (WFC) sold $750 million of preferred shares at
5.2 percent on Aug. 9, Bloomberg data show. Capital One
Financial Corp. (COF) issued $875 million of preferreds at 6 percent
on Aug. 13. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s new shares may be rated Ba1, the highest level
of speculative grade, by Moody''s Investors Service, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the terms aren''t
set. Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. New
York-based JPMorgan handled the sale. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) said its bid to bring a
new rheumatoid arthritis pill to the market has been delayed as
much as three months by U.S. regulators. </p>
<p>The decision by the Food and Drug Administration had been
expected after New York-based Pfizer said on July 31 it would
provide the agency with additional analysis of existing data
that may require more time to review. The FDA had been scheduled
to decide on approval of the drug, called tofacitinib, by today
and now will have until Nov. 21. </p>
<p>The FDA determined that additional data analyses recently
submitted by Pfizer constitute a major amendment to the
application and will require additional time to review, Pfizer
said in a statement today announcing the delay. </p>
<p>Tofacitinib is a pill that inhibits part of the immune
system that can cause rheumatoid arthritis. If approved, it may
generate $2.3 billion in annual sales for Pfizer by 2018,
according to an estimate by Seamus Fernandez, an analyst with
Leerink Swann  Co. in Boston. It would compete with Abbott
Laboratories (ABT) Humira and Johnson  Johnson (JNJ)''s Remicade. </p>
<p>Pfizer shares fell less than 1 percent to $23.69 at the
close of New York trading. </p>

<p>General Electric Co. (GE) plans to sell
$563 million of bonds backed by credit-card payments as sales of
the debt rise. </p>
<p>The securities, including $500 million in top-ranked notes,
are set to be placed with investors this week, according to a
person familiar with the offering who asked not to be identified
because terms aren''t complete. The Fairfield, Connecticut-based
company last issued similar bonds in June, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Sales of asset-backed securities linked to credit-card debt
in 2012 are at the highest level in two years, according to
Wells Fargo  Co. Companies issued $18.9 billion of the bonds
through Aug. 15, up from about $10 billion during the same
period of 2011, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based analysts
said in a report yesterday. </p>
<p>Credit-card lenders have increased their use of
securitization compared with the previous two years to refinance
maturing bonds at lower yields and to meet strong demand from
investors seeking a safe haven, according to the analysts led
by John McElravey. </p>
<p>American Express Co. (AXP), the biggest credit-card issuer by
purchases, sold $2.68 billion of the bonds last week in the
largest asset-backed deal this year, Bloomberg data show. The
company issued top-ranked securities maturing in about three
years to yield 13 basis points more than the benchmark swap
rate, Bloomberg data show. The transaction was increased from
$1.72 billion. </p>
<h2>Limited Growth </h2>
<p>While issuance has climbed, it''s below the 2007 peak of $93
billion, Bloomberg data show. Wells Fargo forecasts as much as
$30 billion in 2012 sales. </p>
<p>Growth in the credit-card asset-backed segment will
probably be limited, according to Wells Fargo. Tighter relative
yields have drawn some issuers back to the market, though
lenders including Capital One Financial Corp., Bank of America
Corp. and Citigroup Inc. have not sold the debt in several
years, the analysts said. The sector contracted following 2010
regulations that scrapped capital relief banks had obtained for
asset-backed offerings. </p>
<p>Relative yields on top-ranked securities linked to credit-
card payments have dropped to 43 basis points more than
Treasuries from 83 basis points on Dec. 31, according to a Bank
of America Merrill Lynch index. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point. </p>

<p>Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G) plans to
seek a buyer for its U.S. life reinsurance business as Chief
Executive Officer Mario Greco works to restore the profitability
of Italy''s biggest insurer, people familiar with the process
said. </p>
<p>Generali has hired Citigroup Inc. (C) to advise on a sale of
Generali USA Life Reassurance Co. and the unit may be worth $800
million to $1 billion, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the process is private. Sales documents are
being prepared and could be sent to potential buyers as early as
next month, they said. </p>
<p>Greco said this month that he is working on a business plan
to restore profitability and strengthen capital. In June,
Generali''s main investors ousted the company''s then CEO,
Giovanni Perissinotto, after the insurer''s profit fell for four
consecutive quarters. Last year, net income slumped 50 percent
to the lowest level since 2002, and the insurer''s stock sank to
an almost two-decade low on May 31. </p>
<p>I would expect that major reinsurers, including Munich Re
and Hannover Re (HNR1), would take a look, if the portfolio focused on
biometric risks and excluded investment risks, said Roland
Pfaender, a Frankfurt-based analyst with Commerzbank AG. </p>
<p>Officials at Generali, Citigroup, Munich Re and Hannover Re
declined to comment. </p>
<h2>Pooling Risks </h2>
<p>Life reinsurers help underwriters like MetLife Inc. (MET) and
Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) pool risks, such as the risk of
higher-than-expected death rates. </p>
<p>Generali USA Life Re rose to No. 2 in the U.S. ordinary
recurring reinsurance market in 2010 from No. 5 in 2009 as
competitors cut back on new business, according to a November
2011 report from Munich Re for the Society of Actuaries. </p>
<p>The Italian company had $78 billion in assumed business in
2010, or a 15.4 percent market share, trailing only the
Reinsurance Group of America Inc., which had 26.3 percent of the
market, according to the report. </p>
<p>Scor SE (SCR) of France agreed last year to buy the mortality
risk reinsurance business of Aegon NV''s Transamerica unit for
$912.5 million. Hannover Re, Germany''s second-biggest reinsurer,
agreed in 2009 to take over Scottish Re Group''s business of
reinsuring U.S. life-reinsurance policies written by ING Groep
NV. (INGA) </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Co. SA (EEEK),
the world''s second-largest bottler of Coke drinks, posted a 15
percent decline in second-quarter profit as poor weather and
austerity measures in European markets slowed demand. </p>
<p>Net income fell to 119.6 million euros ($148 million) in
the three months to June 30 from 141.4 million euros a year
earlier, Athens-based Coca-Cola HBC said today in a statement on
its website. Revenue in the quarter rose to 1.99 billion euros
from 1.97 billion euros. </p>
<p>Strong currency headwinds and higher input costs also
adversely affected profit in the quarter, Dimitris Lois, chief
executive officer, said in a telephone interview today.
Despite this we grew revenue ahead of volume for the fourth
consecutive quarter. </p>
<p>The euro declined 5.1 percent against the dollar in the
second quarter as the region''s debt crisis intensified and
economic growth slowed. Coca-Cola HBC pays in dollars for raw
materials such as PET, used to make plastic bottles, and for
aluminium to make cans. </p>
<p>Lower prices for PET are now easing input costs and we
expect these to show a mid-single digit increase for 2012
compared with a previous forecast for a high single digit
rise, Lois said. </p>
<p>This benefit will be offset by unfavorable foreign currency
movements, reflecting the decline in the euro against the dollar
and the impact of the euro area''s debt crisis on currencies in
emerging and developing markets, he said. </p>
<h2>Challenging Trade </h2>
<p>The company expects challenging trading conditions to
persist across most of its markets with a further deterioration
in disposable income and weak consumer confidence in markets
such as Greece, Italy, Ireland, Hungary and the Czech Republic,
according to the statement. </p>
<p>Given a macroeconomic environment which is getting
tougher and the negative currency impact, we will accelerate
restructuring initiatives planned for 2013 and bring the
majority of them into the fourth quarter this year, Michalis Imellos, chief financial officer, said today in a telephone
interview. </p>
<p>Savings this year from these changes and others already
made in 2011, will now rise by 10 million euros to 50 million
euros while from 2013 onwards savings will reach 70 million
euros, up from 35 million euros, Imellos said. </p>
<p>Cases of drinks sold in emerging markets, which include
Ukraine and Romania, rose 2 percent to 292.2 million in the
second quarter boosted by higher sales in Russia. We see the
economic and trading environment in Russia improving and we
expect the country to continue to drive volume growth in the
emerging market segment, Lois said. </p>

<p>New York City and Massachusetts are
turning to a mixture of philanthropy and profit to fund projects
tackling homelessness and inmate recidivism, using a program
that can offer investors returns as high as 13 percent. </p>
<p>It''s the first embrace in the U.S. of a public-private
funding method known as social-impact bonds. Also called pay-
for-success contracts or social-innovation financing, the model
allows governments to transfer the risk of expanding prevention
programs to investors. Taxpayer money is spent only if the
results exceed a measurable goal set by both parties. </p>
<p>This makes it possible to invest more in prevention,
which are often the first programs that get cut in fiscal
stress, said George Overholser, chief executive officer of
Third Sector Capital Partners, a nonprofit financial-advisory
firm in Cambridge, Massachusetts. </p>
<p>It''s also a way to be sure that the programs that get
funding are also the programs that work, he said. And it''s a
way to align socially progressive goals with fiscally
conservative goals, which is a real political winner. </p>
<p>Overholser, who was on the founding management team of
Capital One Financial Corp. (COF), has been advocating innovations in
social financing since 2001. His company is advising the
nonprofits that will run Massachusetts''s programs. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), whose Wyeth unit set
aside more than $21 billion to settle lawsuits over the fen-phen
diet drug, asked a judge to throw out claims that the pills
caused a fatal disease years after users stopped taking them. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s lawyers asked a federal judge in Philadelphia
today to bar cases from going to trial that allege former fen-
phen users developed primary pulmonary hypertension, also known
as PPH, nine or more years after they last used the appetite
suppressant. Wyeth withdrew the diet-drug combination from the
market in 1997 after it was linked to heart problems and PPH, an
often-fatal lung ailment. </p>
<p>The drugmaker contends in court filings there''s no
reliable scientific evidence to back up claims that using fen-
phen can cause PPH years later. Plaintiffs'' lawyers say studies
show the diet aid has a so-called latency period that can cause
the disease to arise 15 years after its use. </p>
<p>It is crucial that the court exercise its gatekeeper
function to stop these PPH suits now, New York-based Pfizer
told U.S. District Judge Harvey Bartle III in court filings.
Bartle is overseeing some of the remaining 30 PPH cases pending
against the drugmaker. The company is making the same arguments
to bar cases in a state court in Philadelphia. </p>
<p>If Pfizer''s challenge to the PPH latency argument is
successful, it will wipe out the last significant litigation
tied to the drug''s recall, said Alex MacDonald, a Boston-based
plaintiffs'' lawyer who has litigated cases over the diet aid for
more than a decade. </p>
<h2>No Science </h2>
<p>This is a scientifically baseless effort to slam shut the
courthouse doors to scores of dying women afflicted with a
lethal disease caused solely by these diet pills, MacDonald
said this week in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>Pfizer, the world''s largest drugmaker, acquired Wyeth in a
$68 billion buyout in 2009. It also acquired a more than
$21 billion liability for the fen-phen cases, many of which had
been consolidated in federal court in Philadelphia. </p>
<p>More than 6 million prescriptions were written for the diet
combination before it was withdrawn. Consumers took the
company''s Pondimin or Redux drugs as well as the generic
Phentermine to help suppress their appetites. </p>
<p>Wyeth once faced more than 175,000 claims over the diet
combination. Former users accused the drugmaker of hiding its
health risks to generate billions in profits. </p>
<h2>National Settlement </h2>
<p>Wyeth officials sought to resolve the litigation by setting
up a $3.75 billion national settlement program for former users
in 2000. Costs of settlements forced the drugmaker to add
$1.3 billion to the fund in 2004. </p>
<p>The skyrocketing costs of the settlements and litigation
ultimately forced the drugmaker to boost reserves to more than
$21 billion. </p>
<p>While the number of PPH cases Wyeth has faced has been
relatively small, claims over the fatal lung disease have
generated verdicts and settlements for tens of millions of
dollars. </p>
<p>A state-court jury in Beaumont, Texas, ordered Wyeth in
April 2004 to pay more than $1 billion to the family of a former
fen-phen user who died from PPH. The panel awarded Cynthia
Cappel-Coffey''s family $113 million in compensatory damages and
$900 million in punitive damages over the company''s mishandling
of the combination. </p>
<p>Testimony showed that Cappel-Coffey, an X-ray technician,
took Pondimin for five months in 1997 and was diagnosed with PPH
in February 2002. She died the following year at age 41. Cappel-
Coffey''s case later was settled for an undisclosed sum,
according to her lawyers. </p>
<h2>Month''s Use </h2>
<p>Wyeth officials also agreed to pay at least $10 million in
2000 to settle claims brought by the family of a Massachusetts
woman who used the fen-phen combination for less than a month
before developing PPH and dying. </p>
<p>The drugmaker''s lawyers filed their PPH latency challenge
this year as two new cases were set for trial in the federal and
state courts in Philadelphia. </p>
<p>Wyeth''s attorneys contend that Jamie Cheek and Valarie
Farmer can''t prove their PPH cases were caused by their diet-
drug use in the 1990s. Cheek''s symptoms didn''t appear for nine
years after her last use of the drug, and Farmer''s became
evident 11 years after she stopped taking it. </p>
<p>If the drugmaker wins, its lawyers plan to use the rulings
in those two cases to keep the remaining PPH cases around the
country from going to trial. </p>
<h2>Proper Cases </h2>
<p>PPH cases were excluded from the national settlement. Wyeth
officials specifically defined what constituted a proper PPH
case to be litigated outside the accord, Raymond Williams and
Heidi Levine, two of Pfizer''s lawyers, said in a July 7 filing. </p>
<p>The definition requires plaintiffs to present evidence
ruling out alternative causes for their PPH other than diet-drug
use, Pfizer''s attorneys said in the filing. </p>
<p>PPH is not a signature disease that is necessarily
associated with diet-drug use, according to the filing. It
has many non-diet-drug causes. </p>
<p>Anand Agneshwar, a Pfizer lawyer, told Bartle at today''s
hearing that the settlement requires plaintiffs'' doctors to do
an exhaustive review of the possible causes of the former fen-
phen user''s PPH. </p>
<p>The physician must rule out other conditions that could
have caused the ailment, such as sleep apnea, Agneshwar said. </p>
<h2>Year After </h2>
<p>The company also contends the risks of developing PPH tied
to diet-drug use drop a year after the last use of the pills,
according to the filing. </p>
<p>Plaintiffs with cases pending ingested diet drugs nearly
a decade or more before the onset of their symptoms and there is
no reliable evidence of risk today, Chris Loder, a company
spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Plaintiffs still file PPH cases against the drugmaker,
forcing it to spend money to evaluate claims that are sometimes
as much as 11 years old, Pfizer''s lawyers said in the filing. </p>
<p>Part of the essential bargain of the National Settlement
Agreement was an end to settled diet-drug claims, including
claims for pulmonary hypertension when the plaintiff could not
rule out other causes of the disease, Pfizer''s lawyers argued. </p>
<p>Nearly 15 years later, defendants are entitled to the
benefit of their bargained-for release, the lawyers wrote. </p>
<p>Lawyers for PPH claimants counter in their filings that
respected medical researchers have concluded diet-drug use can
be one of the triggers of the lung disease and that it has an
undetermined latency period. </p>
<h2>No Risk'' </h2>
<p>Attorneys for former users said another federal judge who
studied the PPH latency issue found in 2002 that experts
dismissed the idea that there is no risk beyond 12 months of
last use, according to an Aug. 6 filing by Michael Fishbein, a
Philadelphia-based lawyer representing fen-phen claimants. </p>
<p>Medical researchers agree that every known cause of PPH
has a significant period of latency of up to a decade or more,
Fishbein told Bartle at today''s hearing. </p>
<p>Sean Tracey, a Houston-based lawyer who has PPH cases
pending against Wyeth, said the company''s filings show the push
to have the cases thrown out is motivated more by frustration
over the long-running diet-drug litigation than scientific
positions on the latency issue. </p>
<p>They seem to be tired of writing checks, Tracey said in
an interview this month. I''ve told them that my clients are
tired of dying and that these cases deserve to go forward. </p>
<p>Loder, Pfizer''s spokesman, declined to comment on whether
Pfizer officials were frustrated by the continuing PPH
litigation. </p>
<p>The cases are in Re Diet Drugs Products Liability
Litigation, MDL No. 1203, and Brown v. American Home Products
Corp., 2:99-cv-20593, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Pennsylvania (Philadelphia). </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) unveiled its first
new logo in 25 years as it prepares to introduce Windows 8, an
updated version of its flagship software that will power the
company''s own Surface tablet and other touch-screen devices. </p>
<p>The logo uses the so-called Segoe font, which is used in
Microsoft products and marketing materials, and four colored
squares that are intended to express the company''s diverse
portfolio of products, the Redmond, Washington-based company
said on its blog. </p>
<p>Microsoft, the world''s largest software maker, has revamped
products including Windows, phone software and the Xbox game
machine to adopt a sleeker, more modern-looking design to
compete with Apple Inc. (AAPL) for style-conscious consumers. The
colored squares in the new logo resemble the tiles found on
touch-screen phones and tablets. </p>
<p>The new logo is meant to show that this isn''t your
father''s Microsoft, and there is something fresh, but also
familiar, said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at market
research firm Gartner Inc. It also helps to show Windows and
Microsoft''s overall new design language, formerly known as
Metro, are relevant and aspirational to the market. </p>
<p>The redesign comes as consumers are increasingly choosing
the tablets over laptops, weakening personal-computer sales and
curbing Windows revenue. The company has said it plans to
release Windows 8 on Oct. 26 and the Surface with an ARM
Holdings Plc-based chip at the same time. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s board of
directors assigned former KPMG International Chairman Timothy Flynn to its risk committee after an internal probe blamed lax
controls for a $5.8 billion trading loss in London. </p>
<p>Flynn, who retired from the accounting firm in October and
was elected to JPMorgan''s board in May, joined the risk panel in
July, said Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for New York-based
lender. JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon,
56, is the largest bank in the U.S. by assets. </p>
<p>The risk committee came under scrutiny after the trading
loss became public May 10, when it was estimated at $2 billion.
JPMorgan blamed large and illiquid trades at the chief
investment office that couldn''t be unwound without disrupting
markets. The risk panel''s three members included only one with
Wall Street experience, James Crown, and he hadn''t been employed
in the industry for more than 25 years. </p>
<p>The other members included Ellen Futter, 62, president of
the American Museum of Natural History, who sat on American
International Group Inc. (AIG)''s governance committee in 2008, and
David Cote, 60, chief executive officer of Honeywell
International Inc. (HON) The Financial Times reported in May that
Futter was expected to step down from the panel. </p>
<p>Flynn, whose age was listed as 55 in a March news release,
led KPMG International from 2007 until he retired in October,
according to the bank. He has extensive experience in
financial services and risk management from 32 years with KPMG
and its predecessors, the bank said. </p>

<p>General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP)''s
largest shareholder said it won''t pursue a takeover of the
company and has no interest in unloading its stake after
investor Bill Ackman urged the mall owner to consider a sale. </p>
<p>Brookfield Asset Management Inc. (BAM), which owns about 40
percent of General Growth, is not taking any steps to acquire
GGP, the Toronto-based investor said in a statement late
yesterday. Ackman, founder of Pershing Square Capital Management
LP, the No. 2 shareholder, said he''s discussed an acquisition of
the Chicago-based company with Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG), and
that Brookfield planned to pursue a purchase of its own. </p>
<p>Ackman''s discussions with Indianapolis-based Simon, the
only U.S. mall owner larger than General Growth, represent a
turnaround from two years ago, when Pershing Square said a
combination of the two retail landlords raised antitrust
concerns. General Growth left bankruptcy protection in November
2010 following a takeover battle between Simon and an investor
group that included Brookfield and Pershing Square. </p>
<p>We place a small possibility on a sale scenario,
especially in light of Brookfield''s response that it is not
exploring an acquisition of the whole company, nor is it
interested in selling its stake, UBS AG analysts including
Ross Nussbaum wrote in a note today. We see a much greater
likelihood that GGP remains as a standalone entity. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) agreed to buy Kenexa Corp. (KNXA) for about $1.3 billion in cash,
adding social-networking services that help companies handle
human resources and recruiting. </p>
<p>IBM will pay $46 a share for the Wayne, Pennsylvania-based
company, a 42 percent premium over the stock''s closing price on
Aug. 24. The deal is expected to be completed in the fourth
quarter, IBM said today in a statement. </p>
<p>The purchase bolsters IBM''s business-analytics software,
which helps companies cull vast amounts of data to make
decisions and study trends. Kenexa works with more than 8,900
customers, including Starbucks Corp., General Electric Co. and
Boeing Co. Armonk, New York-based IBM has spent $16 billion on
30 analytics acquisitions in the past five years. </p>
<p>This ties very directly into the investments we''ve made
in helping clients create enterprise social networks and how we
apply analytics, Alistair Rennie, IBM''s general manager of
social business, said in an interview. This idea of how you
leverage talent and bring it forward has become a significant
operational issue. </p>
<p>IBM will focus on analysis of the communication patterns
using Kenexa''s systems, Rennie said. The company has been moving
into software and analytics for income growth as hardware and
services become less profitable. Kenexa''s software helps
companies recruit new workers, communicate with employees about
goals and develop succession plans. </p>
<h2>Rival Acquisitions </h2>
<p>The acquisition follows deals by IBM''s competitors for
human-resources software makers, including SAP AG (SAP)''s agreement in
December to purchase SuccessFactors Inc. for $3.4 billion and
Oracle Corp. (ORCL)''s $1.9 billion takeover of Taleo Corp., announced
in February. </p>
<p>Kenexa is unlikely to get a rival bid because of the price
IBM is paying and because there probably won''t be regulatory

<p>HSH Nordbank AG, a German regional
lender bailed out during the financial crisis, sued Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) over more than $634 million
in residential mortgage-backed securities. </p>
<p>HSH Nordbank accused Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, both
based in New York, of making material misrepresentations and
omissions about the underwriting standards used to issue
mortgage loans that were pooled together into the securities,
according to documents filed Aug. 24 in New York State Supreme
Court in Manhattan. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs declined to comment on the lawsuit, Tiffany Galvin, a company spokeswoman, said in a telephone interview.
Lauren Onis, a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley, declined to
comment on the lawsuit immediately in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>HSH Nordbank sued Goldman Sachs over $110 million in
mortgage securities and Morgan Stanley over $524 million of the
investments, according court papers. </p>
<p>Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
biggest recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
and the crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the
market for the securities evaporated. </p>
<p>HSH Nordbank, based in Hamburg, is one of a group of
regional German lenders sued in state court in Manhattan over
mortgage-backed securities during the past year. Other banks
sued by HSH Nordbank include UBS AG and Barclays Plc. </p>

<p>International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) researchers spent four years developing Watson, the computer smart enough to beat the champions of the quiz show Jeopardy! Now they''re trying to figure out how to get those capabilities into the phone in your pocket. </p> <p>Bernie Meyerson, IBM''s vice president of innovation, envisions a voice-activated Watson that answers questions, like a supercharged version of Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s Siri personal assistant. A farmer could stand in a field and ask his phone, When should I plant my corn? He would get a reply in seconds, based on location data, historical trends and scientific studies. </p> <p>Finding additional uses for Watson is part of IBM''s plan to tap new markets and boost revenue from business analytics to $16 billion by 2015. After mastering history and pop culture for its Jeopardy! appearance, the system is crunching financial information for Citigroup Inc. and cancer data for WellPoint Inc. The next version, dubbed Watson 2.0, would be energy- efficient enough to work on smartphones and tablets. </p> <p>The power it takes to make Watson work is dropping down like a stone, Meyerson said in an interview. One day, you will have ready access to an incredible engine with a world knowledge base. </p> <p>IBM expects to generate billions in sales by putting Watson to work in finance, health care, telecommunications and other areas. The computer, which 15 million people saw beat former Jeopardy! champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter, is the company''s most high-profile product since it sold its personal- computer unit to Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) seven years ago. </p> <h2>Voice Recognition </h2> <p>The challenge for IBM is overcoming the technical obstacles to making Watson a handheld product, and figuring out how to price and deliver it. Watson''s nerve center is 10 racks of IBM Power750 servers running in Yorktown Heights, New York, that have the same processing power as 6,000 desktop computers. Even though most of the computations occur at the data center, a Watson smartphone application would still consume too much power for it to be practical today. </p> <p>Another hurdle: It takes a while for Watson to do the machine learning necessary to become a reliable assistant in an area. Watson''s deal with WellPoint (WLP) was announced in September of last year, and the system won''t master the field of oncology until at least late 2013. </p> <h2>Adding Senses'' </h2> <p>Researchers also need to add voice and image recognition to the service so that it can respond to real-world input, said Katharine Frase, vice president of industry research at Armonk, New York-based IBM. </p> <p>In 2.0, we hope to give him more senses, Frase said. A guy could say into his phone, Here''s where I am and here''s what I see,'' lifting it up to take in images of the environment. </p> <p>IBM''s path to the mobile-assistant market contrasts with Apple''s. For one, IBM is focused on corporate customers, while Apple is targeting anyone who buys its phones. </p> <p>Apple made Siri the focus of its marketing of the iPhone 4S, which debuted last year. The software is touted as a personal assistant that can answer a wide range of spoken questions -- Do I need an umbrella tomorrow? -- and put appointments in a calendar. </p> <p>Siri has become a defining characteristic of the iPhone, though it''s also drawn complaints. In a June survey by Minneapolis-based Piper Jaffray  Co., Siri was found to resolve requests correctly less than 70 percent of the time. </p> <h2>Enhancing Siri </h2> <p>Trudy Muller, a spokeswoman for Cupertino, California-based Apple, said customers are happy with Siri and the company will further improve the software in the next version of the iOS operating system. </p> <p>Siri is one of the most popular features of iPhone 4S, she said. With new features coming this fall in iOS 6, Siri will help you get even more done with just your voice. </p> <p>With Watson, IBM aims to tackle more complex questions. The program will be able to understand oncology well enough to advise doctors on diagnosis and prescriptions, said Martin Kohn, IBM''s chief medical scientist. One iPad application for Watson -- a health-care program developed with a Columbia University professor -- is being used to demonstrate its medical capabilities for prospective IBM customers. </p> <p>As the technology is improved, a mobile Watson could  become an extension of services that IBM already offers to  business customers such as WellPoint, the second-biggest U.S. health insurer. The move fits into a broader push to promote analytics software, which helps customers diagnose problems and spot patterns in everything from infant mortality to South American floods. IBM agreed to buy Kenexa Corp. for about  $1.3 billion yesterday as part of the effort. </p> <h2>Studying Symptoms </h2> <p>In one potential scenario, a patient accesses Watson via a mobile device to explain symptoms in natural language. The person then gets several recommendations for what might be happening, listed in order of the computer''s confidence. The patient and a doctor both have access to Watson, which would securely access the patient''s medical records, letting it make adjustments to an answer depending on factors like pregnancy or diabetes, Kohn said. </p> <p>For now, the features are being developed for care providers, not patients themselves, and the program is still in the testing stage. </p> <p>There''s going to come a point where you don''t need any intermediary, Meyerson said. </p> <h2>Learning Subjects </h2> <p>To teach Watson a subject such as oncology, researchers feed the machine with answers to relevant questions. They then ask it to answer similar queries by analyzing documents, websites and books at 66 million pages a second. After enough times telling the machine which answers are accurate, Watson can develop expertise to assist a doctor. </p> <p>It''s going to recommend to you the answer and show you the evidence, Frase said. </p> <p>Adding voice recognition and other senses to Watson might be easier than adding knowledge because IBM already makes tools that understand images and natural language, Kohn said. An IBM project for the U.S. military, for example, translated English into local dialects of Arabic. </p> <p>Watson itself will not interpret images, but IBM has technology that does interpret images and numerical information, Kohn said. Watson 2.0 is all of these different tools, working together. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Sarah Frier" date="Aug 28, 2012 11:15 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-28/ibm-bets-1-billion-on-new-mainframe-in-shrinking-market.html"><headline>IBM Bets $1 Billion on New Mainframe in Shrinking Market</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) spent more than $1 billion over four years to develop a new mainframe computer, betting it can keep up with businesses shifting to cloud-based software and storage. </p> <p>The Armonk, New York-based company is unveiling the zEnterprise EC12 mainframe server today, the latest iteration of a 48-year-old product. It''s the outcome of more than $1 billion in research and development around the world to make the fastest and most secure IBM mainframe yet, said Rod Adkins, senior vice president of systems and technology. </p> <p>Even as IBM shifts its focus to more profitable businesses such as software, the mainframe is central in that strategy, Adkins said in an interview. When you think about how our business model over time will continue to drive more from software and services, you still have to have the foundation. </p> <p>Revenue in IBM''s System Z mainframe line fell 17 percent in the first half from a year earlier, contributing to a decline in the $8 billion systems and technology business, according to a regulatory filing. The company won''t offer financial forecasts for how the new product will perform, Adkins said. </p> <p>Large enterprises such as banks, retailers and government agencies buy mainframes to support their data systems. IBM''s EC12, the first update since 2010, has 50 percent more capacity than its predecessor and runs at 5.5 gigahertz, the fastest in the industry, Adkins said. It''s also designed with built-in security software and support for private cloud environments, meaning a business can run thousands of systems on one mainframe. </p>

<p>TengizChevroil LLP, the Kazakh oil
venture led by Chevron Corp. (CVX), cut oil output 3.8 percent in the
first half from a year earlier as it carried out maintenance. </p>
<p>Crude output fell to 12.5 million metric tons, or 100
million barrels, from 13 million tons, or 104 million barrels,
in the first half of last year, the venture said in a statement
published on its website. </p>
<p>TengizChevroil plans to produce 25 million tons of oil in
2012, a decline of about 3 percent from last year because of
capital repairs at the Caspian Sea project, the Interfax news
service said today, citing General Director Tim Miller in
Almaty, Kazakhstan. </p>
<p>Tengiz is the Central Asian country''s biggest producing
field. The Kazakh venture plans to spend $5 billion to $6
billion drilling in the next five years to sustain output.
TengizChevroil will invest $1 billion of that amount on three to
four wells this year, Miller said on Feb. 14. </p>
<p>TengizChevroil produced 25.8 million metric tons of crude
last year, or almost 565,000 barrels a day, a decline of about
0.4 percent from 2010, according to the Kazakh venture''s

<p>Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, holds 50 percent
of the TengizChevroil venture, while Exxon Mobil Corp. owns 25
percent, state-controlled KazMunaiGaz National Corp. has 20

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) bought $320 million of Fontainebleau Las Vegas Holdings LLC debt as a Nevada court decides who will be paid first by the estate of the bankrupt casino company. </p> <p>Fontainebleau Las Vegas LLC and affiliates Fontainebleau Las Vegas Holdings LLC and Fontainebleau Las Vegas Capital Corp. filed for bankruptcy in Miami in 2009, listing debt of more than $1 billion each. New York-based Morgan Stanley made 67 trades in the company''s claims, SecondMarket Holdings Inc. said today in a report. </p> <p>Billionaire investor Carl Icahn bought the unfinished Fontainebleau Las Vegas casino resort for about $150 million in 2010. Lenders and contractors are fighting over that money, a dispute that is being decided by Nevada Supreme Court judges who heard arguments in June on who has priority claims. </p> <p>The Morgan Stanley trades disclosed in July made Fontainebleau the second most actively traded defunct firm after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., according to the report. Morgan Stanley was a lender to Fontainebleau. </p> <p>Wesley McDade, a Morgan Stanley spokesman, declined to comment on the claims-trading report. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley''s purchases, filed in July, were made in the past year on behalf of clients, said a person familiar with the trades who wasn''t authorized to comment on the issue and asked not to be named. </p> <p>SecondMarket, which publishes monthly data on claims using bankruptcy court filings, counts trades in the month they are disclosed in court, even if the debt changed hands earlier. </p> <h2>Lehman Claims </h2> <p>Trading volume in Lehman debt, which has dominated the market for distressed companies'' claims, fell by half to $900 million last month, from $1.9 billion in June, according to SecondMarket data. </p> <p>A spurt of speculation before Lehman made its first payment to creditors pushed the face value of trades as high as $6.4 billion in the 30 days before the March 18 record date, according to SecondMarket. </p> <p>Lehman, now out of bankruptcy, paid $22.5 billion to claimholders in April, or 53 percent more than it previously estimated was possible. A second payout of undisclosed size is due on Oct. 1 from the defunct firm, which had said it will return 18 cents on the dollar to creditors by about 2016. </p> <p>The MF Global Inc. brokerage was the third most actively traded company, with $208 million of its debt changing hands in July, followed by AMR Corp. (AAMRQ), with volume of $26.5 million, the report said. </p> <h2>Computing Claims </h2> <p>The totals refer to the face value of the claims, not the trading prices, which reflect payment prospects and aren''t disclosed. SecondMarket counts trades in the month they are disclosed, not when the debt actually changes hands. </p> <p>Once the world''s fourth-biggest investment bank, New York-based Lehman filed for bankruptcy in 2008 listing debt of $613 billion. MF Global Holdings Ltd., the brokerage''s parent company, filed the eighth-largest U.S. bankruptcy on Oct. 31 with debt of almost $40 billion. </p> <p>Big trading firms have been selling Lehman debt they accumulated during the company''s bankruptcy, said Andrew Gottesman, head of claims trading for SecondMarket. </p> <p>As a result, there is less activity on the whole across the market, he said. </p> <p>The $2.8 billion Fontainebleau Las Vegas project, about 70 percent finished when it failed, was designed for more than 24 acres on the Las Vegas Strip, according to a 2010 lawsuit by Wilmington Trust FSB, agent for lenders, against holders of mechanics'' liens asserting claims to the casino''s sale proceeds. </p> <p>The Lehman case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Apache Corp. (APA)
will hold talks with YPF SA (YPFD) next month as the Argentine company
nationalized in April seeks partners to step up shale oil
development, said a YPF official briefed on the matter. </p>
<p>YPF Chief Executive Officer Miguel Galuccio will meet with
Exxon and Apache executives during a conference in Houston on
Sept. 18-21, said the official, who asked not to be named,
citing company policy. Exxon, which is already exploring for
unconventional oil and natural gas with YPF in Argentina,
doesn''t comment on private meetings, said Patrick McGinn, an
Exxon spokesman. John Roper, an Apache spokesman, declined to
comment. </p>
<p>Galuccio, who met with Chevron Corp. (CVX) executives in Buenos
Aires on Aug. 24, is scheduled to unveil today a model for three
types of partnerships to tap the Vaca Muerta shale formation, a
Connecticut-size area in southern Argentina that contains at
least 23 billion barrels. Contracts will be for financial and
strategic partners and operators, Galuccio said Aug. 23. </p>
<p>September will be the month in which YPF will show its
capacity to attract investors, Francisco Perez, the governor
of Mendoza province, said in an interview in Buenos Aires. </p>
<p>Perez and Neuquen Governor Jorge Sapag said they will
accompany Galuccio to Houston. The two provinces own YPF shares. </p>
<p>The chief executive, appointed after President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner seized control of YPF from Spain''s Repsol
SA in April, may also travel to China later next month to meet
with representatives of CNOOC Ltd. (883) and China Petroleum 
Chemical Corp. (600028), the YPF official said. </p>
<h2>Fraught with Peril'' </h2>
<p>Galuccio described Vaca Muerta earlier this month as the
tip of the iceberg for YPF''s projects. The company, based in
Buenos Aires, has drilled 45 wells at the shale development.
Fernandez seized YPF on the grounds that Madrid-based Repsol
under-invested since it acquired the company in 1999. </p>
<p>YPF, Argentina''s biggest energy company, approved this
month the sale of as much as 5 billion pesos ($758 million) of
bonds. The company is seeking funds to invest $7 billion in 2013
as it plans to double exploration in five years and boost
refining, Galuccio said June 5. </p>
<p>Galuccio is scheduled to disclose at 12 p.m. Buenos Aires
time his proposals for attracting investors to develop Vaca
Muerta as part of a more than 1,000-page business plan. </p>
<p>Vaca Muerta is often considered to have the greatest
potential as an oil shale outside of North America, Roger Plank, chief corporate officer at Houston-based Apache, said at
an Aug. 15 energy conference. Having operations in Argentina
makes sense even as the country is fraught with peril, he
said. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) and Citigroup Inc. (C)
agreed to delay setting a valuation for their brokerage joint-
venture as they wrangle over the sale of a 14 percent stake. </p>
<p>A determination of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney''s fair
market value will be made Sept. 10 rather than this week,
according to a statement yesterday from Morgan Stanley, which is
buying the stake from Citigroup to boost its holding to 65
percent. Shannon Bell, a Citigroup spokeswoman, declined to
elaborate. </p>
<p>The companies hired Perella Weinberg Partners LP to help
settle a disagreement this year over the unit''s value, which
Citigroup estimated is about $13 billion more than an amount
submitted by Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley Chief Executive
Officer James Gorman, 54, has said the purchase of the whole
brokerage is key to his strategy of making the firm less reliant
on trading revenue and improving profitability. </p>
<p>The two New York-based banks formed the joint venture in
2009 with more financial advisers than any brokerage. Morgan
Stanley paid $2.75 billion for a 51 percent stake and the right
to buy the rest over time. The bank announced in May it would
exercise its option to increase its stake. It has the right to
buy another 15 percent next year and 20 percent in 2014. </p>
<p>Citigroup estimated in a July 19 regulatory filing that its
49 percent stake was worth $11 billion and said Morgan Stanley''s
bid was 40 percent of that. Citigroup faces a writedown that
could top $6 billion if Morgan Stanley''s valuation is accepted.
That''s twice Citigroup''s $2.9 billion estimated third-quarter
net income, according to the average of 13 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The brokerage, which is run by Morgan Stanley''s Greg Fleming, 49, is largely made up of the Smith Barney and Dean
Witter businesses. Gorman said in June that he will change the
name of the unit to Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), whose Wyeth unit
reserved more than $21 billion to settle lawsuits over the fen-
phen diet drugs, lost its bid to have claims that the pills
caused a fatal disease years after users stopped taking them
thrown out. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Harvey Bartle III in Philadelphia today
rejected Pfizer''s arguments that there was no reliable evidence
that fen-phen could cause an often-fatal lung disease to arise
years after a user stopped taking the pills. </p>
<p>Experts hired by plaintiffs to review their cases can
properly rely on studies and case reports showing primary
pulmonary hypertension, known as PPH, can be caused by diet-drug
combination more than 10 years after the last use of the
appetite suppressant, Bartle said in a 22-page ruling. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s challenge to plaintiffs'' PPH latency argument was
an attempt to wipe out the last significant litigation tied to
the diet-drug combination''s 1997 recall, Alex MacDonald, a
Boston-based plaintiffs'' lawyer who has litigated cases over the
pills for more than a decade, said this month. </p>
<p>Today''s decision is a total victory for plaintiffs, who
only sought to keep the courthouse doors open so they could have
juries hear how their loved ones died of a horrible disease
because they took prescription diet drugs years ago, MacDonald
said in a telephone interview today. </p>
<h2>Weighing Options'' </h2>
<p>Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said in an e-mailed
statement today that the company was disappointed with Bartle''s
ruling and was weighing its legal options. </p>
<p>Pfizer, the world''s largest drugmaker, acquired Wyeth in a
$68 billion buyout in 2009. It also acquired a $21.1 billion
liability for the fen-phen cases, many of which had been
consolidated in federal court in Philadelphia. </p>
<p>More than 6 million prescriptions were written for the diet
combination before it was withdrawn. Consumers took Wyeth''s
Pondimin or Redux drugs as well as the generic Phentermine to
help suppress their appetites. </p>
<p>Wyeth once faced more than 175,000 claims over the diet
combination. Former users accused the drugmaker of hiding its
health risks to generate billions in profits. </p>
<p>Wyeth officials sought to resolve the litigation by setting
up a $3.75 billion national settlement program for former users
in 2000. Costs of settlements forced the drugmaker to add $1.3
billion to the fund in 2004. Wyeth eventually boosted reserves
to more than $21 billion. </p>
<h2>PPH Verdicts </h2>
<p>While the number of PPH cases Wyeth has faced has been
relatively small, claims over the fatal lung disease have
generated verdicts and settlements for tens of millions of
dollars. </p>
<p>A state-court jury in Beaumont, Texas, ordered Wyeth in
April 2004 to pay more than $1 billion to the family of a former
fen-phen user who died from PPH. The panel awarded Cynthia
Cappel-Coffey''s family $113 million in compensatory damages and
$900 million in punitive damages over the company''s mishandling
of the combination. </p>
<p>The drugmaker''s lawyers filed their PPH latency challenge
this year as two new cases were set for trial in the federal and
state courts in Philadelphia. </p>
<p>Wyeth''s attorneys argued Jamie Cheek and Valarie Farmer
couldn''t prove their PPH cases were caused by their diet-drug
use in the 1990s. Cheek''s symptoms didn''t appear for nine years
after her last use of the drug, and Farmer''s became evident 11
years after she stopped taking it. </p>
<h2>Philadelphia Suits </h2>
<p>Cheek''s case is filed in federal court in Philadelphia and
among the cases consolidated before Bartle while Farmer''s suit
is pending in state court in the same city. </p>
<p>The women''s lawyers countered there are a wealth of studies
and case reports to back up the idea that PPH can have a latency
period of a decade or more and that respected medical
researchers have linked the disease to diet-drug use. </p>
<p>While Bartle found that plaintiffs'' experts properly relied
on those studies and case reports to argue that their diet-drug
use caused them to develop PPH, it will be up to a jury to make
the final determination of that issue. </p>
<p>The ruling expressed no view on whether Ms. Cheek''s
ingestion of diet drugs caused her PPH when her symptoms did not
appear until eleven years after she stopped taking those

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA) are seeking bigger stakes and operating control in the
Kashagan oil field before starting to expand the $46 billion
project, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>Exxon and Shell have warned they may quit the project
unless they gain more control in the venture and Kazakhstan''s
government agrees to extend the production-sharing contract for
20 years, the people said, declining to be identified as the
talks are confidential. </p>
<p>The Kashagan project in the Caspian Sea, touted as the
world''s biggest discovery in four decades when found, is slated
to reach commercial oil output no later than June 2013. The
Kashagan partners, which also include Eni SpA (ENI) and Total SA (FP), want
the second phase to widen the project''s profit margin after
costs for the first phase ballooned from early estimates. </p>
<p>Exxon and Shell may seek to buy out ConocoPhillips (COP)''s 8.4
percent stake in Kashagan, the two people said. ConocoPhillips
plans to sell $8 billion to $10 billion of assets by the middle
of 2013 and has said Kashagan may not offer a long-term,
strategic opportunity. </p>
<h2>Leave Kashagan </h2>
<p>Exxon and Shell will consider leaving the project if they
don''t reach an agreement on prolonging the Kashagan contract and
on operatorship, the two people said. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil is a long-term investor in Kazakhstan and
plans to remain a major investor in the country, Charlie Engelmann, a spokesman for the Irving, Texas-based oil company,
said by e-mail, declining to comment further. Ross Whittam, a
London-based spokesman for Shell, declined to comment, as did an
Eni press officer who declined to be identified, citing company
policy. </p>
<p>China National Petroleum Corp., seeking to enter Kashagan,
has engaged Citic Resources Holdings Ltd. (1205) to hold talks with the
partners that may want to divest, Energy Intelligence Group
said, citing unidentified people. Citic would then sell the
stake on to state-owned CNPC, the newsletter said. </p>
<p>With cost overruns and multiple delays over the past
decade, the international partners agreed in 2008 to cut their
stakes in Kashagan, boosting KazMunaiGaz''s interest to 16.8
percent. That is equal to the holdings of Exxon, Shell, Total
and Eni. Japan''s Inpex Corp. (1605) is also a partner with 7.56
percent. </p>
<h2>Kashagan Operator </h2>
<p>The budget for the first phase is set to reach $46 billion
by the time the first oil is exported, a person with knowledge
of the matter said in January. An early cost estimate put the
tab at about $24 billion. While output is scheduled to start at
the end of the year, the project will reach commercial output no
later than June 2013, said Lyazzat Kiinov, head of state-run
KazMunaiGaz National Co., said in December, when he was deputy
oil minister. </p>
<p>At the time, Eni ceded operatorship of Kashagan to North
Caspian Operating Co., an umbrella for the partners, each of
which is responsible for specific tasks while jointly making
decisions on the development. NCOC put Eni in charge of delivery
of Kashagan''s first phase, with Shell responsible for developing
offshore facilities in the second phase, and Exxon overseeing
drilling, according to venture''s website. </p>
<p>Kazakhstan''s biggest oilfield will produce 370,000 to
450,000 barrels of oil a day in the first phase, an amount that
may double in the second phase in 2018 or 2019, the government
said last year. The Oil Ministry oversees the Kashagan
production-sharing agreement, which allows the investors to
recoup costs before the government takes its share of oil
revenue. The agreement runs to 2041, according Eni''s website. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) was accused in
a lawsuit of manipulating clients'' foreign-exchange transactions
for its own benefit. </p>
<p>The Louisiana Municipal Police Employees'' Retirement System
filed a complaint yesterday in Manhattan federal court alleging
that the bank took advantage of investors by causing them to pay
what were often the worst currency rates available on a given
trading day. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s scheme allowed it, in violation of its
contractual and fiduciary obligations, to extract hundreds of
millions of dollars in illicit risk free profits from its
clients under the guise of FX trading, according to the
complaint. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the largest bank in the U.S. by assets, recorded
more than $4 billion in foreign exchange revenue between 2005
and 2011, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>The pension fund, which is suing on behalf of other
institutional investors for which the New York-based bank
executed currency trades since 2005, is seeking damages,
punitive damages and disgorgement of profits. </p>
<p>A JPMorgan spokeswoman, Jennifer Zuccarelli, didn''t
immediately return a call seeking comment on the lawsuit. </p>
<p>The case is Louisiana Municipal Police Employees''
Retirement System v. JPMorgan Chase  Co., 12-cv-6659, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan) </p>
