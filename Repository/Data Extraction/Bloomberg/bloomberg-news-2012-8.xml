&lt;p&gt;The good thing about having back
surgery if you&#8217;re an Olympic athlete, says U.S. water polo
player Peter Hudnut, is it gives you time to be an intern. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of 11 members of the American squad returning to the
Olympics after winning a silver medal in Beijing, Hudnut will
join Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s private wealth management
division following the London Games, which end Aug. 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The job at Goldman may never have happened if a back
injury, multiple fractures in two vertebrae and shoulder
problems hadn&#8217;t sidelined the 32-year-old Stanford University
graduate before the 2004 Games in Athens. While surgery and
months of rehabilitation hampered his athletic career, they gave
him time to get work experience, Hudnut said in an interview at
London&#8217;s Athletes Village. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I was somewhat lucky in that I had so many injuries and
every time I had a surgery it would put me out for a handful of
months,&#8221; the 6-foot-5 central defender said. &#8220;I was lucky
enough to get some internships -- some through friends, some on
my own -- and that helped guide me where I wanted to go.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Positions at CIM Group, Bank of New York Mellon Corp. and
Los Angeles developer Ratkovich Co., as well as his 2011
Stanford business degree, awakened an interest in finance, he
said. Twenty-eight interviews with Goldman left him feeling he&#8217;d
found a firm where he could both learn and use the skills
gleaned from years of strenuous training. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Desire, Discipline &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Desire, discipline and all the things I&#8217;ve used in water
polo are very applicable to finance,&#8221; Hudnut said. &#8220;The focus
and drive, the ability to communicate effectively with many
different personality types and many different situations, the
ability to adapt and be flexible; these are all traits that team
sport, especially at this level, demand.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. squad water polo team trained in Thousand Oaks,
California, for almost a year, giving up professional positions
on teams overseas, Hudnut said. The team spent between five and
seven hours in meetings, five days a week. They watched video,
lifted weights and practiced in the pool. The daily sessions
averaged seven to eight hour as the Olympics neared. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Peter in Beijing was a really important part of the glue
that kept the team together,&#8221; coach Terry Schroeder said in an
interview after the U.S. beat Britain 13-7 on Aug. 2. &#8220;As he
plays a bit more and feels comfortable with his playing, he&#8217;s
taken on that role more and more again and it&#8217;s really important
to the team.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preliminary round finishes today with the U.S. playing
Hungary, the 2008 champions. The Americans have won three of
their four early stage matches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Early Dreams &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hudnut was introduced to water polo as a 10-year-old by
Richard Corso, the assistant coach of the 1984 U.S. team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I was this huge uncoordinated kid and he came and handed
me this baby blue bag and on one side it had the Olympic rings
and on the other side it said USA,&#8221; Hudnut said, adding that he
could barely swim at the time. &#8220;Inside was a water polo ball, a
little suit and a water polo hat.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost 6 feet tall (1.82 meters) at 12, Hudnut began
playing against boys two and three years older than himself. In
1992, Corso became the head coach for the U.S. national team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He would drive me down with him to national team
practice, so I would watch the guys and talk to some of the
heroes of that time about what Olympics meant to them,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;That really lit that fire.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Better Than Beijing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranked ninth in the run-up to the Beijing Games, the U.S.
beat Serbia in the semifinals before losing 14-10 in the gold
medal match against Hungary. It was America&#8217;s first medal in
water polo in 20 years. The 2012 squad is more tightly knit and
tactically and physically equal to the best teams, Hudnut said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I truly believe that this is the first time in a number
of Olympics that any of the top seven teams could potentially
win,&#8221; he said, adding that playing in professional leagues in
Europe has boosted the ability of both American and Australian
players. The U.S. last won a gold medal in water polo in 1904. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winning silvers in men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s water polo in Beijing
was the first time a country walked away with two medals in the
event at a single Olympics, Bill Smith, USA Water Polo secretary
and finance committee chairman and the president of Greenwich,
Connecticut-based Renaissance Capital LLC, said in a telephone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether he wins a second medal, Hudnut is looking forward
to the next stage of his life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I know it&#8217;s going to be a tough year and that&#8217;s one of
the things that inspires me,&#8221; Hudnut said. &#8220;From a challenge
perspective, my desire to succeed and do well gets me up in the
morning. I hope that Goldman is a true career path for me.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) faulted a plan
by the trustee liquidating Peregrine Financial Group Inc. to
request customer documents directly from Chief Executive Officer
James Dimon, saying it was &#8220;inefficient and unnecessary.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trustee Ira Bodenstein asked a judge for authority to
subpoena JPMorgan and nine other financial institutions for
customer documents as part of what he called a routine
examination of the defunct futures brokerage&#8217;s records, serving
papers directly on their CEOs. JPMorgan told the judge it had
instead authorized its lawyers to accept the trustee&#8217;s requests
on behalf of Dimon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Although styled as a &#8216;routine&#8217; motion under this court&#8217;s
local rules, certain of the proposed terms and conditions upon
which the trustee seeks to conduct the proposed examinations are
anything but &#8216;routine,&#8217;&#8221; the bank said in a filing in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Chicago today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trustee told the judge last month he needs access to
customer documents to identify &#8220;abnormalities&#8221; in the
company&#8217;s records. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
has accused Peregrine founder Russell Wasendorf Sr. of
misappropriating more than $200 million of customer funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Account Applications &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subpoenas will also go to Citigroup Inc. (C), U.S. Bank, Bank
of New York Mellon Corp. (BK), First Premier Bank, Commerzbank AG,
Royal Bank of Scotland Plc, Jefferies Bache LLC, Morgan Stanley (MS)
and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the trustee said. All maintained
account applications, authorization forms, agreements,
statements, wire transfers, canceled checks, deposit slips and
correspondence, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bodenstein&#8217;s proposal to bar the banks from recovering the
costs of providing the documents also is a departure from the
norm, JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is &#8220;an exceptional and impermissible departure from the
federal rules and the debtor&#8217;s own contractual undertakings,&#8221;
it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peregrine&#8217;s July 10 bankruptcy, cutting off customers&#8217;
access to their accounts, came less than a year after the
failure of MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ), whose clients are still
missing money. In district court in Chicago, a receiver is
finding and securing Wasendorf&#8217;s assets on request of the CFTC,
which is probing the missing customer money, as is the Justice
Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Personal Investments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wasendorf may have funded his personal investments with
Peregrine brokerage money, the receiver has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its bankruptcy petition, Cedar Falls, Iowa-based
Peregrine listed more than $500 million in assets and more than
$100 million in liabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. Wasendorf, 12-mj-131, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of Iowa (Cedar Rapids). The
bankruptcy case is Peregrine Financial Group Inc., 12-27488,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago).
The regulatory case is U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
v. Peregrine Financial Group Inc., 12-cv-05383, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel Pinto, co-head of JPMorgan
Chase  Co.&#8217;s (JPM) newly expanded corporate and investment bank
division, holds $19.6 million of restricted and unrestricted
stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pinto, 49, has $8.7 million of the New York-based bank&#8217;s
shares directly and through a trust, as well as $10.9 million in
restricted-stock units that vest in installments through 2015,
according to a filing today to the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pinto was elevated to run the division with Mike Cavanagh
as part of a senior-management shakeup last month, following at
least $5.8 billion in losses on a London unit&#8217;s trades. The pair
replaced Jes Staley, who gave up day-to-day operational duties
as head of the investment bank to become chairman of the
expanded unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Jody Shenn" date="Aug 06, 2012  3:19 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-06/goldentree-hires-goldman-sachs-trader-salem-in-mortgage-push-1-.html"><headline>GoldenTree Hires Goldman Sachs Trader Salem in Mortgage Push</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;GoldenTree Asset Management LP, the
$15.7 billion hedge fund specializing in corporate credit, hired
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) trader Deeb Salem as the firm expands
its mortgage-bond team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salem started at New York-based GoldenTree this week, Chief
Investment Officer Steven Tananbaum said today in an interview.
Salem, who left the bank in May, was among the Goldman Sachs
traders who handled its bets against subprime mortgages as the
debt collapsed in 2007, at one point trying to manipulate prices
of derivatives tied to the loans, according to a report last
year by a U.S. Senate panel. Salem denied wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asset managers including Canyon Partners LLC, Brevan Howard
Asset Management LLP and D.E. Shaw  Co., known for betting in
markets such as real estate, government notes or company
debentures, have been wagering on mortgage securities as
potential returns narrow elsewhere, accelerating gains in
housing debt. The $1 trillion market for U.S. home-loan bonds
without government backing offers &#8220;probably the most upside in
structured products,&#8221; though carries more risk than notes such
as collateralized loan obligations tied to companies&#8217; health,
Tananbaum said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The mortgage space for us is a good opportunity, and
we&#8217;re building up our team,&#8221; he said today during an interview
on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;Market Makers&#8221; with Erik Schatzker
and Stephanie Ruhle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Junk Yields &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salem, who was Goldman Sachs&#8217;s head trader of non-agency
mortgage securities without guarantees from government-backed
Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae, declined to comment, as
did Michael DuVally, a spokesman at the New York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low benchmark interest rates have forced investors to look
down the credit spectrum to seek assets with higher returns.
Speculative-grade company bonds yielded 7.5 percent Aug. 3
before accounting for potential defaults, down from 8.5 percent
at the end of 2011, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data. High-yield corporate loans offered 6.6 percent Aug.
3, down from a high this year of 7.2 percent Jan. 3, according
to JPMorgan Chase  Co. data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subprime-mortgage bonds yield 7.5 percent after anticipated
losses for debt with projected average lives of at least seven
years, JPMorgan estimates. The yields are quoted on a loss-adjusted basis because homeowner defaults and refinancing mean
the securities usually aren&#8217;t outstanding until maturity. Yields
will be greater if forecasts for foreclosures, recoveries or
refinancings among the underlying loans prove too pessimistic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Subprime Securities &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returns on senior subprime securities from 2005 through
2007, the years that produced the most defaults, have averaged
more than 26 percent this year, Barclays Plc index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salem joined Goldman Sachs in 2001, according to records
maintained by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which
don&#8217;t show him involved in any regulatory actions, civil
lawsuits, criminal matters or customer complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the mortgage meltdown in 2007, he was the bank&#8217;s
lead trader of single-name credit-default swaps referencing
residential-mortgage-backed securities, according to the 2011
report by the Senate&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His group was &#8220;able to learn from our bad long position at
the end of 2006 and layout the game plan to put on an enormous
directional short,&#8221; Salem said in a 2007 self-evaluation
excerpted in the report. &#8220;The results of that are obvious.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Short Squeeze&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Company documents also showed Goldman Sachs traders led by
Michael J. Swenson sought to encourage a &#8220;short squeeze&#8221; by
putting artificially low prices on swaps that would gain in
value as mortgage securities fell, the panel said. The idea,
abandoned after market conditions worsened, was to drive holders
to sell and help the bank buy at reduced prices, according to
its report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We began to encourage this squeeze, with plans of getting
very short again,&#8221; Salem said in the self-evaluation. &#8220;This
strategy seemed do-able and brilliant, but once the negative
fundamental news kept coming in at a tremendous rate, we stopped
waiting for the shorts to capitulate, and instead just
reinitiated shorts ourselves immediately.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In interviews with the committee, Salem and Swenson, his
supervisor, denied attempting a short squeeze. Salem &#8220;claimed
that he had wrongly worded his self-evaluation,&#8221; according to
the report. &#8220;He said that reading his self-evaluation as a
description of an intended short squeeze put too much emphasis
on &#8216;words.&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Client Interests &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The committee cited the episode as an example of how
Goldman Sachs traders placed its interests ahead of clients as
the value of mortgage investments tumbled. The panel, led by
Senator Carl M. Levin, a Michigan Democrat, and Tom Coburn,
Republican of Oklahoma, called on regulators to craft strict
bans on proprietary trading and conflicts of interest to keep
the problems from recurring. The bank has denied wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Bloomberg Television interview, Tananbaum said
that changes at Wall Street banks are making it easier to poach
employees. &#8220;The firms&#8217; behavior has changed and because of that
they&#8217;re more open-minded,&#8221; he said. Salem is an &#8220;honest,&#8221;
&#8220;high-integrity guy,&#8221; he added in an interview after the
appearance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Kasia Klimasinska" date="Aug 06, 2012  1:24 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-06/jpmorgan-california-grid-manager-spar-over-power-market-payment.html"><headline>JPMorgan, California Grid Manager Spar Over Power-Market Payment</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) said accusations
of market manipulation by California&#8217;s electric-grid operator
are &#8220;irrelevant and unproven&#8221; as the parties spar over
payments for power from 2009 to 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The California Independent System Operator, which oversees
the wholesale power market in the state, has said the payments
were excessive and the result of bidding behavior and took the
case to the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. JPMorgan
said the California operator reached conclusions before FERC
completes its investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state operator &#8220;cannot muster any meaningful,
substantive responses to the legal arguments&#8221; in the case,
according to an Aug. 3 filing made by JPMorgan. &#8220;Therefore it
resorts to irrelevant and unproven allegations&#8221; about the
bidding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FERC Chairman Jon Wellinghoff said in March that the agency
will be vigorous in seeking to stop companies from manipulating
electricity markets, after the agency reached a record $245
million settlement with Constellation Energy Group Inc. for
trading practices in New York and New England. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s role was disclosed when the agency, responding
to a complaint from the state, asked a federal judge in
Washington to retrieve some of JPMorgan&#8217;s e-mails as part of the
investigation. JPMorgan has said it acted within the law in its
bidding for California power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FERC doesn&#8217;t have any deadline for ruling on California&#8217;s
request, agency&#8217;s spokesman Craig Cano said by phone today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Dawn Kopecki" date="Aug 06, 2012  9:02 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-06/jpmorgan-names-eileen-serra-as-ceo-of-chase-card-services.html"><headline>JPMorgan Names Eileen Serra as CEO of Chase Card Services</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) named Eileen
Serra chief executive officer of Chase Card Services, replacing
Gordon Smith, who will co-run consumer and community banking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serra, 57, who currently manages Chase&#8217;s mass-affluent and
high-net-worth customer businesses, will run all of card
services for New York-based JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by
assets, the company said today in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Eileen has excelled at every role she&#8217;s performed at the
firm,&#8221; Smith said in the statement. Serra joined JPMorgan in
2006 from Merrill Lynch  Co., where she was managing director
and head of private-client banking solutions. She worked at
American Express Co. and McKinsey  Co. before that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith was elevated to his new role on July 27 amid a
shakeup of senior managers following a trading loss of at least
$5.8 billion in one of the company&#8217;s London units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Matthew Campbell" date="Aug 06, 2012  7:35 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-06/zaoui-brothers-found-new-firm-after-yoel-leaves-goldman.html"><headline>Zaoui Brothers Found New Firm After Yoel Leaves Goldman</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Michael and Yoel Zaoui, former MA
bankers at Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
respectively, are starting a new firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zaoui Capital LLP was incorporated on July 26, according to
documents filed with the U.K.&#8217;s Companies House. The documents
list Michael, 55, and Yoel, 51, as officers of the company,
which is registered to the London offices of U.S. law firm
Schulte Roth  Zabel LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yoel Zaoui resigned as co-head of global mergers and
acquisitions at Goldman Sachs in April, while Michael ran
European MA at Morgan Stanley until he retired in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pair, who are French citizens, attracted attention in
the late 1990s for being on the opposite sides of some of the
era&#8217;s biggest takeover battles, including the $58 billion deal
that created French energy giant Total SA and Vodafone Group
Plc (VOD)&#8217;s $137 billion hostile bid for Mannesmann AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yoel has been among potential candidates to lead Vivendi
SA (VIV), the French media and telecommunications group that ousted
Chief Executive Officer Jean-Bernard Levy this year as it began
a review of its wide-ranging corporate structure, people
familiar with the deliberations said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Takahiko Hyuga" date="Aug 07, 2012  9:20 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-07/goldman-sachs-among-firms-pledging-better-controls-to-japan-fsa.html"><headline>Goldman Joins JPMorgan in Promising Better Japan Controls</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) were among banks that pledged to improve how they
guard client information in Japan amid an insider trading
scandal that toppled Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)&#8217;s top two executives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs plans to train employees on ethics from
November through February, and last month began programs on
maintaining confidentiality, the New York-based bank said in a
statement on its website yesterday. JPMorgan plans to increase
compliance staff in Japan and boost monitoring of communication
between employees to avoid leaks, it said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The securities firms are trying to curb the fallout after
the financial watchdog&#8217;s investigation arm concluded that staff
at three firms including Nomura leaked information ahead of
clients&#8217; share sales in 2010, eroding their credibility. The
Financial Services Agency last month asked 12 investment banks
to report on how they manage the data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You can&#8217;t restore confidence overnight,&#8221; said Takao Saga, a professor at Waseda University in Tokyo and commissioner
at the Japan Securities Research Institute. &#8220;Whether training
or monitoring will work remains to be seen, as employees have
been leaking inside information knowing that they may be
breaching rules.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nomura and Daiwa also submitted reports pledging to improve
how they manage corporate information, as did Bank of America
Corp. (BAC)&#8217;s Merrill Lynch, UBS AG and Deutsche Bank AG. (DBK) The
securities watchdog had concluded that staff at Daiwa and
JPMorgan also tipped traders ahead of deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dismissal Risk &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is telling staff they may be fired if they
leak inside information, Hiroko Matsumoto, a Tokyo-based
spokeswoman, said yesterday. The Wall Street firm employed about
850 staff at its Japanese brokerage unit as of March 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Getting employees to understand that rule breaches mean
they will lose jobs or end their careers will have an important
influence,&#8221; Saga said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s FSA ordered Nomura on Aug. 3 to improve its
business after it failed to prevent staff from providing tips to
traders on at least three share sales in 2010. The scandal led
to Koji Nagai replacing Kenichi Watanabe as chief executive
officer on Aug. 1, a month after the firm released a report
revealing that equity sales staff appeared to be &#8220;willing to do
anything&#8221; to meet revenue targets. Atsushi Yoshikawa replaced
Takumi Shibata as chief operating officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Brokerages Fall &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 19-stock Topix Securities and Commodity Futures Index
rose 1.2 percent at 10 a.m. in Tokyo. The gauge has fallen 25
percent since the first case of leaks was revealed on March 21,
more than the benchmark Topix Index (TPX)&#8217;s 12 percent drop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being embroiled in the country&#8217;s information-leaking cases
has also led to lost business as companies and government
agencies distance themselves from tainted firms. Nomura was
removed from a lead role Japan Airlines Co.&#8217;s $8.5 billion
initial public offering, people with knowledge of the situation
said on July 18. It also lost its rank as Japan&#8217;s No. 1 bond
underwriter last month as issuers dropped the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daiwa also lost at least one bond deal, when Kawasaki Heavy
Industries Ltd. (7012) excluded it from managing a sale on July 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co., a Tokyo-based
brokerage venture between Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306)
and Morgan Stanley, said yesterday it also plans to improve
compliance measures as part of the FSA review. The brokerage
will tighten oversight of costs related to entertaining clients
and is considering issuing recordable mobile phones to some
staff in its sales and research divisions, it said yesterday in
a statement on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pay Cuts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411), Japan&#8217;s third-biggest bank by
market value, said it will strengthen oversight of information
between departments at its investment banking unit and more
closely monitor e-mails. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316)&#8217;s SMBC Nikko
Securities Inc. unit will increase the liability of employees
who breach compliance rules, it said yesterday on its website.
SMBC Nikko President Eiji Watanabe and Chairman Shigenobu Aikyo
will have their pay cut by 30 percent for four months, the
company said, following the June arrest of a former executive on
suspicion of aiding insider trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C)&#8217;s local brokerage unit said it plans to
improve information safeguards by clarifying policies on how it
manages corporate information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, may buy back as much as 11 percent
of current shares outstanding by the end of 2013, according to
International Strategy  Investment Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That target could be reached if the New York-based company
speeds the reduction of risk-weighted assets and the Federal
Reserve approves the repurchase program, Edward Najarian, an
analyst at ISI, wrote in a research note today. Otherwise, ISI
estimates Goldman Sachs will buy back 6 percent of fully diluted
shares outstanding, or about 31 million shares, over the next
six quarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank is unlikely to earn a sustainable return on
tangible common equity above 10 percent between 2012 and 2014
and Goldman Sachs, therefore, is fairly valued at between 80
percent and 90 percent of tangible book value, according to the
note. The shares are likely to remain in a range of $95 to $120,
wrote Najarian, who has a hold rating on the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t see tremendous upside from its current stock
price and remain wary of the challenging macro backdrop as well
as Goldman&#8217;s volatile earnings,&#8221; Najarian wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs climbed 1.2 percent to $103.24 in New York
today and has advanced 14 percent this year. The shares trade at
83 percent of tangible book value, an estimate of how much the
firm would fetch in a liquidation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spot gasoline in California jumped to
the highest level against futures in almost three months after
Chevron Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s Richmond oil refinery, Northern California&#8217;s
largest, shut its only crude unit following a fire yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in San Francisco
gained 29.5 cents to a premium of 35 cents a gallon against
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 4:46 p.m.
East Coast time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That&#8217;s
the highest level for Carbob in the Bay Area since May 14 and
the largest single-day increase since at least November 2007,
when Bloomberg began compiling spot prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s no availability&#8221; for the fuel, Bob van der Valk,
a petroleum industry analyst in Terry, Montana, said in an e-
mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s 240,000-barrel-a-day refinery shut its No. 4
crude unit after a blaze erupted at about 6:30 p.m. local time
yesterday, Heather Kulp, a Richmond-based spokeswoman for
Chevron, said earlier today. The fire is out and other units are
operating at unknown levels, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t know how long the crude unit will be down, and
they may have had to shut other refining units as well,&#8221; Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston, said in
an electronic message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbob in Los Angeles jumped 25.5 cents to a premium of 28
cents a gallon versus futures, also the most since May 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend, or CARB, diesel in Los Angeles
strengthened 5.25 cents to 11.5 cents a gallon above Nymex
heating oil futures, the highest level in three months. The same
fuel in San Francisco slipped 0.5 cent to a 10.5-cent-a-gallon
premium versus futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in Portland, Oregon,
jumped 14 cents to 15 cents a gallon over Nymex gasoline
futures. Low-sulfur diesel there was up 4 cents to 24 cents a
gallon above heating oil futures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks advanced, sending the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index higher for a third straight day,
amid better-than-estimated corporate earnings and speculation
global central banks will take steps to boost economic growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Morgan Stanley (MS) rallied at least
1.9 percent to pace gains among financial companies in the SP
500. Chesapeake Energy Corp., the second-largest U.S. natural-gas producer, increased 9.4 percent after reporting the highest
quarterly profit in the company&#8217;s history. Fossil Inc. (FOSL) surged 31
percent after forecasting earnings that exceeded analysts&#8217;
projections amid increasing sales of its Skagen brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About two stocks rose for each that fell on U.S. exchanges
at 4 p.m. New York time. The SP 500 (SPX) added 0.5 percent to
1,401.35. It gained 2.7 percent in three days. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average climbed 51.09 points, or 0.4 percent, to
13,168.60. Volume for exchange-listed stocks in the U.S. was 6.4
billion shares, or about in line with the three-month average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fear of things collapsing is going away,&#8221; said Tom Wirth, who helps manage $1.6 billion as senior investment
officer for Chemung Canal Trust Co., in Elmira, New York. &#8220;The
recession, which everyone was concerned about a month ago, is
not going to happen. There&#8217;s a perception that the ECB is
willing to buy bonds if needed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks rose as 72 percent of the SP 500 companies
which reported second-quarter results beat earnings estimates,
Bloomberg data show. Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President
Eric Rosengren said the central bank should pursue an &#8220;open-ended&#8221; easing program of &#8220;substantial magnitude.&#8221; German
Chancellor Angela Merkel backed a bond-buying plan announced by
the European Central Bank, a spokesman said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Biggest Gains &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six out of 10 groups in the SP 500 rose today as commodity
and industrial shares had the biggest gains. The Morgan Stanley
Cyclical Index of companies most-tied to the economy added 1.3
percent. The KBW Bank Index (BKX) of 24 stocks advanced 0.8 percent.
JPMorgan rallied 2 percent to $37.01. Morgan Stanley jumped 2.6
percent to $14.50. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A measure of energy shares had the biggest gain in the SP
500 among 10 industries, rallying 1.3 percent. Chesapeake (CHK) rose
9.4 percent to $19.37. The company increased the minimum it
plans to raise through asset sales this year to $13 billion from
$11.5 billion, and said more than half of that will come by the
end of next month when it completes sales of Texas oifields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fossil surged 31 percent, the most in the SP 500, to
$91.77. It forecast full-year profit excluding certain items of
as much as $5.34 a share, the Richardson, Texas-based company
said in a statement today. Analysts projected $5.27, the average
of 14 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Las Vegas &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MGM Resorts International rallied 7.5 percent to $10.08.
The largest casino operator on the Las Vegas Strip reported a
smaller-than-anticipated loss in the second quarter amid lower
winnings in Nevada. Sales (MGM) rose 29 percent, boosted by inclusion
of the company&#8217;s 51 percent owned MGM China Holdings Ltd.
subsidiary in the overall results for a full quarter, compared
with one month a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sirius XM Radio Inc. (SIRI) climbed 4.6 percent to $2.30. The
largest U.S. satellite-radio company boosted its annual profit
forecast after adding subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tower International Inc. (TOWR) gained 6.5 percent to $9.28 after
the supplier of metal auto-parts reaffirmed its forecast for an
earnings increase in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cepheid Inc. (CPHD) climbed 13 percent to $38.70. The maker of
rapid tests for infections announced an agreement with the U.S.
government and the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation to reduce the
price of its tuberculosis screening in poorer countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Luxury Handbags &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coach Inc. (COH) jumped 1.9 percent to $55.89. The largest U.S.
luxury handbag maker was raised to buy from hold at Canaccord
Genuity Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesoro Corp. (TSO) rallied 5 percent to $34.41. The independent
refiner rose as analysts said a fire yesterday at Chevron
Corp.&#8217;s Richmond, California, plant may push up the state&#8217;s
gasoline prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BroadSoft Inc. (BSFT) surged 34 percent to $37.45. The maker of
telecommunications software raised its full-year profit forecast
and announced a deal for Adaption Technologies Ventures Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knight Capital Group Inc. lost 0.3 percent to $3.06,
reversing a rally of as much as 7.2 percent. The firm rejected a
$500 million rescue-loan offer from Citadel LLC on Aug. 5 as it
worked on a competing plan from a group of investors, said two
people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm sought the lifeline after a programming
malfunction spewed orders through exchanges Aug. 1 and saddled
the company with a $440 million trading loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pfizer, JJ &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer (PFE) Inc., Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) and Elan Corp. ended most
plans to develop an Alzheimer&#8217;s drug after a second trial
failure, a blow to the companies&#8217; efforts to market the first
product to slow progress of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until the bapineuzumab trials were stopped, Pfizer, Elan
and JJ were competing with Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly (LLY)  Co.
to create the first therapy to target a cause for Alzheimer&#8217;s,
rather than just its symptoms. Trial results for the Lilly
therapy, solanezumab, are due soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer lost 2.1 percent, the most in the Dow, to $23.74.
Johnson  Johnson slid 0.8 percent to $68.29. Lilly fell 2.2
percent to $42.75. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leap Wireless International Inc. tumbled 19 percent to
$4.49. Its net customer losses almost tripled last quarter, a
sign the company is struggling to keep up with larger carriers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Capital Agency Corp. (AGNC) lost 3.3 percent to $32.96.
The real-estate investment trust plunged the most in 10 months
at today&#8217;s open as millions of shares traded before the stock
recovered about two-thirds of the loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First Minutes &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 6.5 million shares of the company changed hands in
the first three minutes following the open of exchanges at 9:30
a.m. New York time today, more than the stock has traded on
average in a full day this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NII Holdings Inc. (NIHD) slumped 24 percent to $6.11. The wireless
carrier that operates the Nextel brand in Latin America cut its
profit and sales forecasts, citing mounting competition and
network spending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WMS Industries Inc. sank 18 percent to $14.99. The maker of
gaming and video-lottery machines forecast fiscal first-quarter
revenue little changed from a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regional banks have become a more telling indicator of the
U.S. stock market&#8217;s prospects than the country&#8217;s largest
lenders, according to Donald Coxe, a strategy adviser to Bank of
Montreal&#8217;s securities unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lagging Behind &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The KBW Regional Bank Index has lagged behind the SP 500
most of the time since March 2009, when the latter gauge started
rising from a 12-year low. The index of 50 lenders has also
failed to keep pace since the first week of June, when stocks
began their current rally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This performance contrasts with the KBW Bank Index,
consisting of Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM), Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) and 20 more of the biggest U.S.
banks. The gauge, included in the chart, has gained more than
the SP 500 since March 2009 and in the past two months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The tide is turning away from those mega-institutions,&#8221;
Coxe wrote in an Aug. 3 report. The shift results from &#8220;badly
behaved bankers&#8221; who relied on the government for help during
the 2008 financial crisis and fought efforts to rein in their
business afterward, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pacific Investment Management Co.&#8217;s Mohamed El-Erian said
investors who took advantage of the rally in risk markets should
reduce their exposure in favor of safer assets amid domestic
economic weakness and global political stresses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Uncertain Time&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is an unusually uncertain time,&#8221; El-Erian, the
chief executive officer of the world&#8217;s largest manager of bond
funds, said on Bloomberg Radio&#8217;s &#8220;Hays Advantage&#8221; with
Kathleen Hays. &#8220;It&#8217;s not just Europe. Let&#8217;s not forget there is
a fiscal cliff in the U.S. Let&#8217;s not forget geopolitics is
heating up in Iran again.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasury yields remain close to lowest ever amid a slowing
economy, global financial turmoil and U.S. unemployment above 8
percent for more than three years. The year-end &#8220;fiscal cliff&#8221;
of higher taxes and reductions in spending on defense and other
government programs that will take effect unless Congress acts
also clouds the economic outlook, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Dakin Campbell and Donal Griffin" date="Aug 07, 2012  4:15 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-07/durbin-calls-6-6-billion-visa-swipe-fee-accord-bad-deal.html"><headline>Durbin Calls $6.6 Billion Visa Swipe-Fee Accord Bad Deal</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Senator Richard Durbin, who won
federal limits on debit-card swipe fees, said merchants should
&#8220;think hard&#8221; before signing a $6.6 billion settlement with
Visa Inc. (V), MasterCard Inc. (MA) and banks over credit-card fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a stunning giveaway to Visa and MasterCard,&#8221;
Durbin, the Senate&#8217;s second-ranking Democrat, said in remarks
last week, according to the Congressional Record. &#8220;This is a
bad deal, but it is not a done deal. The merchant plaintiffs
still have to decide if they will support it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa and MasterCard, the world&#8217;s biggest payment networks,
and some of the largest banks agreed to the settlement last
month after a seven-year legal battle. The accord, which
requires a judge&#8217;s consent, also includes a temporary reduction
in so-called credit-card swipe fees, or interchange, and allows
retailers to impose surcharges on such transactions. The fees
average about 2 percent of the purchase price and generate more
than $40 billion a year for U.S. banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It gives Visa and MasterCard free rein to carry on their
anti-competitive swipe-fee system with no real constraints and
no legal accountability,&#8221; said Durbin, of Illinois. &#8220;This is
not a settlement I would agree to. I hope that the remaining
merchant plaintiffs will review the proposed settlement
carefully and think hard about whether it will be good for the
future of our credit- and debit-card systems.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Antitrust Law &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement may be nullified if enough merchants refuse
to join. Visa, MasterCard and the banks can terminate the accord
if the retailers who opt out account for more than 25 percent of
the U.S. credit-card spending processed by the two networks from
Jan. 1, 2004, through the month the accord is approved by the
court, according to a memorandum of understanding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MasterCard fell 0.8 percent to $416.40 in New York trading,
the worst performance today in the 71-company Standard  Poor&#8217;s
500 Information Technology Index. Visa was third-worst, sliding
0.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durbin pushed to include debit-card limits in the 2010
Dodd-Frank Act, and the Federal Reserve last year capped those
fees at about half the average that retailers had paid
previously, costing banks about $8 billion in annual revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts
Democrat and co-author of the legislation who sought to undo the
debit limits, said he supported the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A free-market approach in this area will be better for
the economy and all concerned parties,&#8221; he said in a July 19
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Very Challenging&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supporters of additional interchange legislation may
struggle to win enough backing in Congress, which approved Dodd-
Frank when Democrats controlled both chambers. Republicans, most
of whom opposed the price caps, seized control of the House
after the 2010 election and 54 senators led by Jon Tester, a
Montana Democrat, voted last year to delay the implementation of
Durbin&#8217;s debit rules. The measure required 60 votes for passage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s highly possible Senator Durbin will introduce credit
interchange legislation in next year&#8217;s Congress, though it will
be very challenging to gain broad-based support,&#8221; Jason Kupferberg, a Jefferies  Co. analyst who covers Visa and
MasterCard, said in a July 20 research note. &#8220;Some of the class
plaintiffs could opt out of the settlement and initiate new
lawsuits.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Larkin, chief executive officer of the National
Grocers Association, which opposes the settlement, said his
group plans to push for more legislation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Complex Dispute&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to predict what Congress will do and won&#8217;t
do,&#8221; Larkin said in a July 27 interview. &#8220;It would be our
intention to continue to talk to Congress because we think we
need to achieve further reforms.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erica Harvill, a spokeswoman for San Francisco-based Visa,
declined to comment, as did James Issokson at Purchase, New
York-based MasterCard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The long business-to-business conflict over these fees is
finally over and settled by the legal process,&#8221; said Trish Wexler, a spokeswoman for the Electronic Payments Coalition, a
trade group that represents payment networks and banks. &#8220;The
legal system was and is the appropriate system to resolve a
large and complex dispute between companies, not Washington.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa&#8217;s share of the settlement filed in federal court in
Brooklyn, New York, is about $4.4 billion and MasterCard is
responsible for $790 million, the firms have said. Bank of
America Corp. (BAC), the second-biggest U.S. credit-card lender, said
last week that it will contribute $738 million, most of which
already had been deposited into Visa&#8217;s litigation escrow fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Very Confident&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute began in 2005, a year before MasterCard&#8217;s
initial public offering and three years ahead of Visa&#8217;s.
Merchants alleged the companies violated antitrust law by fixing
the swipe fees. The case had been set for trial in September
before U.S. District Judge John Gleeson in Brooklyn. The parties
have until Sept. 21 to agree on the details of the settlement
and merchants will have 180 days after the accord is approved to
decide whether to opt out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are very confident that the court is going to approve
this settlement,&#8221; Josh Floum, Visa&#8217;s legal chief, said in a
July 25 conference call after the company reported fiscal third-
quarter results. &#8220;This case has been pending for seven years,
and during a great deal of that time, there has been a court-
ordered mediation process with two mediators and the involvement
of the court.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement includes cash payments of $6.05 billion and
$525 million. The larger amount would be reduced if some
plaintiffs don&#8217;t agree to participate. The accord also provides
for a 10-basis-point reduction in interchange fees for eight
months, valued at about $1.2 billion if all merchants in the
proposed class approve, according to plaintiffs&#8217; law firms
including Robins Kaplan Miller  Ciresi LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Detrimental Conduct&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), the world&#8217;s largest retailer, and
Minneapolis-based Target Corp. (TGT), the second-biggest U.S. discount
chain, criticized the settlement last month. Wal-Mart urged all
merchants to reject it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The proposed settlement would require merchants to
broadly waive their rights to take action against the credit-
card networks for detrimental conduct or acts,&#8221; Bentonville,
Arkansas-based Wal-Mart said in a July 24 statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Target said the accord would &#8220;perpetuate a broken
system,&#8221; according to a July 20 statement on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merchant groups including the National Association of
Convenience Stores have said they won&#8217;t participate in the
settlement, saying the agreement offers too much to Visa and
MasterCard and is unfair to retailers. The National Community
Pharmacists Association also said it will reject the accord. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant
Discount Antitrust Litigation, 05-md-01720, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, agreed to pay $60.2 million to settle foreign bribery
cases it brought to U.S. authorities involving alleged payments
paid by employees and agents of subsidiaries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer entered into two agreements with the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the New York-based drugmaker reached a
deferred prosecution accord with the Department of Justice,
according to filings today in federal court in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. law enforcement authorities have been probing
drugmakers including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd,
AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) and GlaxoSmithKline
Plc (GSK) for possibly breaking an overseas anti-bribery law that bars
employees or their agents from paying bribes to foreign
government officials to obtain or retain business. Today&#8217;s
settlements stem from payments and gifts Pfizer said its foreign
units made to government-employed doctors and workers in eastern
Europe, China and the Middle East, according to the filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These improper payments were variously made to influence
regulatory and formulary approvals, purchase decisions,
prescription decisions, and to clear customs,&#8221; according to a
complaint filed by the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inaccurate Books &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC said the payoffs were made &#8220;without the knowledge
or approval of officers or employees of Pfizer, but the
inaccurate books and records of Pfizer subsidiaries were
consolidated in the financial reports of Pfizer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer alerted U.S. authorities in 2004 after probing the
claims. More payments were found when the drugmaker bought its
Wyeth unit in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The actions which led to this resolution were
disappointing, but the openness and speed with which Pfizer
voluntarily disclosed and addressed them reflects our true
culture and the real value we place on integrity and meeting
commitments,&#8221; Amy Schulman, Pfizer&#8217;s general counsel, said in
an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We expect every colleague across Pfizer
to adhere to the highest standards of conduct.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares fell 2.1 percent to $23.74 at the close of
New York trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department charged the Pfizer HCP Corp. unit
with two criminal counts, conspiracy to violate the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act and a violation of the FCPA&#8217;s anti-bribery
provisions. Prosecutors agreed to defer prosecution and drop the
charges after two years if Pfizer continues to cooperate and
take remedial steps. The settlements must be approved by a
federal judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Criminal Fine &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors agreed to a criminal fine of $15 million, a 34
percent reduction, because of the company&#8217;s &#8220;extraordinary
cooperation&#8221; after voluntarily disclosing the payments, and its
&#8220;extraordinary and ongoing remediation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer disclosed in regulatory filings last year that it
had reached agreements in principle with the Justice Department
and the SEC &#8220;to resolve matters concerning potentially improper
payments&#8221; made by the company outside the U.S., without
specifically citing the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has been voluntarily cooperating with government
investigators since 2004, the company said. Governments in other
countries also are investigating potentially improper payments,
Pfizer said in the filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Eight Countries &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlements announced today include Pfizer operations
in eight countries: Bulgaria, Croatia, Kazakhstan, Russia,
Italy, China, the Czech Republic and Serbia. The Wyeth
settlement, over its nutrition business, was for China,
Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer agreed for two years to submit reports to the SEC on
the company&#8217;s anticorruption efforts and the status of
implementing compliance measures, according to court filings.
The company won&#8217;t be subject to direct monitoring by the Justice
Department of the SEC, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyeth agreed to settle without admitting or denying the
bribery allegations, according to a court filing by Wyeth vice
president, Bradley Lerman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Bulgaria, local representatives spent $28,000 to invite
government doctors on &#8220;incentive trips&#8221; to Greece, as a reward
for the physicians who were the biggest prescribers of Pfizer&#8217;s
products, Pfizer admitted according to the Justice Department
filing. They also paid $17,000 to send doctors to medical
conferences, again in exchange for commitments to prescribe
Pfizer drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Croatian Doctor &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Croatia, the unit there had used a consulting agreement
with a government doctor to help influence which drugs were
allowed to be sold in the country, paying the physician in cash
and travel expenses, Pfizer admitted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer also admitted to what was called the &#8220;hospital
program,&#8221; in Russia, where doctors were given a 5 percent kick-
back on certain drugs prescribed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pfizer Russia used the Hospital Program to make cash
payments to individual government healthcare professionals to
corruptly reward past purchases and prescriptions of Pfizer
products, and to corruptly induce future purchases and
prescriptions,&#8221; the Justice Department said in the filing.
Pfizer&#8217;s Russian unit also used intermediary companies to pay
off doctors and government officials, the company admitted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Illegal Payments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act makes payments to
foreign officials to win business illegal. It was created after
a SEC investigation in the 1970s found that 400 U.S. companies
had paid $300 million in bribes abroad, according to the Justice
Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bristol-Myers, based in New York, said April 26 it received
a subpoena in March from the SEC and the company is cooperating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glaxo said in its 2010 and 2011 annual reports that the SEC
and the Justice Department were conducting an industry-wide
investigation into whether drug companies bribed officials in
Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, Italy, Poland, Russia
and Saudi Arabia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glaxo is among the companies that received inquiries, and
it is cooperating, the London-based company said. Stephen Rea, a
spokesman, said Aug. 6 the company had nothing to add. &#8220;We
continue to cooperate with the ongoing investigation,&#8221; he said
by e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca received inquiries from the SEC and the Justice
Department, according to the London-based company in its 2010
and 2011 annual reports. The company also &#8220;is investigating
indications of inappropriate conduct in certain countries,
including China,&#8221; according to the 2011 report. The
investigations are continuing and the company is cooperating,
Sarah Lindgreen, an AstraZeneca spokeswoman, said by e-mail on
Aug. 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Medical Devices &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manufacturers of medical devices also have reported getting
requests in the past year for information from U.S. prosecutors
and regulators on compliance with the act in Europe and South
America. The law bars corporate employees or their agents from
paying bribes to government officials to obtain or retain
business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olympus Corp., the world&#8217;s largest maker of endoscopes,
said Aug. 1 it had uncovered &#8220;irregularities&#8221; at a doctor-
training program in Brazil that may have violated the U.S. law.
Smith  Nephew Plc (SN/), Europe&#8217;s biggest maker of artificial hips
and knees, agreed in February to pay $22.2 million to settle
U.S. allegations that it paid bribes to doctors employed by
government hospitals or agencies in Greece. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JJ Agreement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2011, Johnson  Johnson (JNJ), the world&#8217;s biggest
health-products maker, agreed to pay $70 million after admitting
that the company bribed doctors in Europe and paid kickbacks in
Iraq to win contracts and sell drugs and artificial joints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, Biomet Inc., a closely held maker of medical
devices, agreed to pay $22.9 million to settle U.S. accusations
it bribed foreign doctors to win business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department and SEC are investigating
allegations that Wal-Mart Stores Inc. approved as much as $24
million in bribes in Mexico. Wal-Mart disclosed the payments to
the Justice Department and the SEC, according to a December 2011
regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pfizer cases are U.S. Securities of Exchange Commission
v. Pfizer Inc. (PFE), 12-cv-01303; U.S. Securities of Exchange
Commission v. Wyeth LLC, 12-cv-1304; and U.S. v. Pfizer HCP
Corp., 12-cr-00169, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia

&lt;p&gt;Gasoline rose to a 12-week high as
refinery shutdowns increased supply concerns and stronger Brent
crude boosted the cost of shipments of fuel from abroad and
imported oil used at U.S. plants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures gained as a fire that shut the crude unit at
Chevron Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s Richmond refinery in California follows outages
in the Midwest and Gulf Coast. Prices broke above $3 a gallon
for the first time since May as Brent advanced to a two-month
month high. North Sea oil shipments are poised to fall 7 percent
next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;ve had a lot of refining issues and now you have West
Coast problems,&#8221; said Andrew Lebow, a senior vice president at
Jefferies Bache LLC in New York. &#8220;Brent has been very strong as
maintenance has really left a handful of cargos to trade and
there&#8217;s backwardation in the Brent market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasoline for September delivery rose 6.91 cents, or 2.4
percent, to $2.9913 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the highest settlement since May 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent oil for September settlement advanced $2.45 to $112 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Brent&#8217;s
premium over U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate oil widened
98 cents to $18.33 a barrel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Brent spread moving above $18 is why you&#8217;re seeing
products moving out more,&#8221; said Gene McGillian, an analyst and
broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Technical Rally &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasoline touched $3.0088 as the front-month contract traded
above the 100-day moving average for the first time since May 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Breaking through the 100-day is huge from a technical
view,&#8221; said Michael Smith, president of TK Futures  Options
in Port Saint Lucie, Florida. &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t surprise me to see
it run up another 20 cents just like that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s 240,000-barrel-a-day refinery shut its crude unit
after a fire yesterday and has no estimate for restarting it.
Hurricane Ernest developed today in the Caribbean off the
eastern coast of Mexico&#8217;s Yucatan Peninsula, according to the
National Weather Service. A disruption to Mexican oil output
could boost demand for fuel exports from the Gulf Coast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There could be some Mexican production shut down due to
the hurricane,&#8221; said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price
Futures Group in Chicago. The fire at Chevron Richmond &#8220;could
mean a large percent of West Coast refining capacity is offline
in the aftermath of all the problems we had in the Chicago
Midwest area.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PADD 5, which covers the U.S. West Coast, has 3.03 million
barrels a day of operable refinery capacity, or 18 percent of
total U.S. capacity, according to Energy Department data. The
Richmond plant is about 7.9 percent of West Coast refining. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heating oil for September delivery rose 5.71 cents, or 1.9
percent, to $2.998 a gallon on the exchange and touched $3.0085,
the highest intraday price since May 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, gained
1.5 cents to $3.634 a gallon yesterday, AAA data showed. That&#8217;s
the highest price since May 25. Prices have fallen 7.7 percent
from a 2012 high of $3.936 on April 4, according the nation&#8217;s
largest motoring organization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fire at Chevron Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s Richmond
oil refinery in California pushed gasoline prices higher today
as it disrupted fuel output at the state&#8217;s third-largest crude-
processing plant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s 240,000-barrel-a-day refinery shut its only crude
unit after the fire yesterday, Heather Kulp, a Richmond-based
spokeswoman for Chevron, said today. The fire is out, she said,
and the plant is maintaining a small controlled burn at the
crude unit to relieve pressure. Other units are operating at
unknown levels, Kulp said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in San Francisco
gained 23 cents to a premium of 28.5 cents a gallon against
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 12:42 p.m.
East Coast time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That&#8217;s
the highest level for Carbob in the Bay Area since May 29 and
the largest single-day increase since Bloomberg began compiling
spot prices in November 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These increases will be passed along to retail pumps at
California and gas stations as far north as Seattle,&#8221; Bob van der Valk, a petroleum industry analyst in Terry, Montana, said
in an e-mail. He said BP Plc (BP/)&#8217;s Cherry Point refinery in
Washington took four months to reach full operation after a fire
in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Estimate &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kulp said the refinery doesn&#8217;t have a restart estimate for
the No. 4 crude unit, which has a daily throughput capacity of
257,200 barrels a day, according to an Aug. 11, 2011, document
on file with the Bay Area Air Quality Management District. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other process units at the refinery include a 64,800-
barrel-a-day diesel hydrotreater, a 96,000-barrel-a-day jet
hydrotreater, a 57,600-barrel-a-day naphtha hydrotreater, a
90,000-barrel-a-day fluid catalytic cracker plant and a 60,900-
barrel-a-day isocracker, according to the document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A vapor leak of hydrocarbons that began in the crude unit
at about 4:15 p.m. local time yesterday increased and ignited at
6:30 p.m., Kulp said in an interview on KQED radio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of people have sought medical treatment for
&#8220;minor complaints&#8221; since the blaze broke out, Randy Sawyer,
the director of Contra Costa County&#8217;s hazardous materials
division, said by telephone from Martinez, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All employees at the refinery have been accounted for, and
three employees were treated on site for minor injuries, Brent Tippen, a San Ramon, California-based Chevron spokesman, said in
a phone interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Evacuation Report &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plant reported an evacuation after the fire broke out,
a filing with the California Emergency Management Agency shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Contra Costa County health-services department issued a
shelter-in-place advisory for Richmond, North Richmond and San
Pablo because of the fire. The advisory was lifted late
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Richmond plant is about 110 years old, according to
Chevron&#8217;s website. Built on a peninsula of low hills rising from
San Francisco Bay, the refinery became the West Coast&#8217;s largest
and most advanced upon its completion in 1902. The refinery
produces gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, lubricants and other oil
products, according to the company&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron shut a crude unit at Richmond on Nov. 14 after
vacuum residuum, made up of heavy hydrocarbons, leaked from a
bleeder on a filter and &#8220;auto ignited,&#8221; Chevron said in a
filing to county regulators following that incident. The unit
was returned to service later that same month, two people with
direct knowledge of the plant&#8217;s operations said Nov. 29. A crude
unit at the refinery also caught fire in January 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The county&#8217;s hazardous materials division was at the
refinery testing air quality after yesterday&#8217;s fire, according
to a notice from the county health department. The plant
released sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, hydrogen oxide,
sulfuric acid and nitrogen dioxide because of the fire, the
state filing shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Whitney McFerron" date="Aug 07, 2012  9:51 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-07/goldman-sachs-recommends-french-wheat-on-export-outlook-1-.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Recommends French Wheat on Export Outlook</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Wheat traded in Paris may rise
relative to futures in Chicago as prospects of declining
production in the former Soviet Union mean Europe is likely to
gain export market share, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs recommended buying wheat for delivery in
March 2013 on NYSE Liffe in Paris, against a bearish bet for
March 2013 wheat on the Chicago Board of Trade, New York-based
analyst Damien Courvalin said today in an e-mailed report. CBOT
wheat prices have surged 41 percent since the end of May,
bolstered by drought in the U.S., while Paris wheat climbed 23
percent in the same period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia and Ukraine, which also have suffered from dry
weather this year, face &#8220;potential for export restrictions&#8221; on
grain, Courvalin said. In 2010, Paris wheat surged 92 percent,
outpacing a 47 percent gain in Chicago futures, after the worst
drought in 50 years spurred Russia to halt exports for 10
months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With CBOT wheat prices trading at a premium to Black Sea
and EU wheat prices despite higher freight costs, we expect this
export demand to initially be directed to EU-27 wheat
supplies,&#8221; Courvalin said. Shipments from both the EU and the
U.S. may be larger than the U.S. Department of Agriculture
currently estimates, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. is expected to be the world&#8217;s biggest wheat
exporter this year, followed by Australia, Canada, the 27-
country bloc of the European Union, and Russia, according to the
USDA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;World Production &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global wheat production may total 652.1 million metric tons
in the 2012-13 season, less than the USDA&#8217;s July forecast of
665.3 million tons, as smaller harvests in Russia, Kazakhstan,
Argentina and China offset increasing output in the U.S., EU and
Canada, Courvalin wrote. The USDA is scheduled to update its
outlook on Aug. 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman pegged global wheat inventories, excluding China
and India, at 93.7 million tons, the lowest since the 2007-08
season, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. corn production may be 10.75 million bushels, below
the USDA&#8217;s forecast of 12.97 million, Courvalin said. Demand for
wheat used in livestock feed may increase in coming months as
drought slashes corn supplies, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A further deterioration in weather conditions, potential
FSU export restrictions and pent-up import demand create risks
that global wheat inventories decline even more than we
expect,&#8221; Courvalin said. &#8220;Such an outcome in the face of
inelastic food demand would likely push wheat prices sharply
higher and well above corn prices to price wheat out of feed
demand.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank reiterated its forecasts for CBOT wheat prices at
$9.80 a bushel in three months, $8.75 in six months and $7.75 in
12 months. The December contract traded today at $9.09. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) said it contained a
fire that broke out in the crude unit at its Richmond refinery,
the largest in Northern California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company was bringing down units after a blaze at the
No. 4 crude unit started yesterday around 6:15 p.m. local time,
according to a person with direct knowledge of the operation who
asked not to be identified because the information isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flames were brought under control as of 10:30 p.m. local
time, and all employees at the refinery have been accounted for,
said Melissa Ritchie, a Chevron spokeswoman at the plant. One
person was being treated for minor burns on the wrist, she said.
The plant reported an evacuation after the fire broke out, a
filing with the California Emergency Management Agency shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crews determined there was a diesel leak from a line in
the crude unit that may have started the fire, Ritchie said. She
declined to confirm the definite cause of the incident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Contra Costa County health-services department issued a
shelter-in-place advisory for Richmond, North Richmond and San
Pablo because of the fire. The agency recommended that residents
stay inside their homes or the nearest buildings, bring pets
indoors, close doors and windows, and make sure vents and
fireplaces are closed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Richmond plant can process 240,000 barrels a day of
feedstock, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The plant is about
110 years old, according to the company&#8217;s website. Built on a
peninsula of low hills rising from San Francisco Bay, the
refinery became the West Coast&#8217;s largest and most-advanced plant
upon its completion in July 1902, according to the website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hazardous Materials &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The county&#8217;s hazardous materials division was at the
refinery to test air quality, according to a notice from the
health department. The plant released sulfur dioxide, nitrogen
oxide, hydrogen oxide, sulfuric acid and nitrogen dioxide
because of the fire, the state filing shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BART, the regional transit system, halted service between
the Richmond station and El Cerrito Plaza, a notice on the
agency&#8217;s website shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery produces gasoline, jet fuel, diesel,
lubricants and other oil products, according to the company&#8217;s
website. The plant is one of six refineries that make up more
than 75 percent of Chevron&#8217;s total refining capacity, the
website shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nov. 14 Incident &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery shut a crude unit on Nov. 14 after vacuum
residuum, made up of heavy hydrocarbons, leaked from a bleeder
on a filter and &#8220;auto ignited,&#8221; Chevron said in a filing to
county regulators following that fire. The unit was returned to
service later that same month, two people with direct knowledge
of the plant&#8217;s operations said Nov. 29. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s oil refineries and filling stations earned $1.88
billion as U.S. processing margins climbed to a second-quarter
record average of $28.98 a barrel when crude costs fell faster
than gasoline prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s net income fell to $7.21 billion, or $3.66 a
share, from $7.73 billion, or $3.85, a year earlier, the San
Ramon, California-based company said in a statement July 27. The
result was 35 cents more than the average of four analysts&#8217;
estimates compiled by Bloomberg, which ranged from $3.10 to
$3.47. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acer Inc. (2353) said Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s
planned introduction of its own brand of tablet computers is
negative for the industry and would pit the software company
against its customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;On one hand Microsoft is our partner, but on the other,
Microsoft&#8217;s move makes them compete not only with us but all PC
makers,&#8221; Henry Wang, a spokesman for Acer, the world&#8217;s third-
largest computer maker, said by telephone today. &#8220;We think that
Microsoft&#8217;s launch of its own-brand products is negative for the
whole PC industry.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft in June unveiled Surface, a tablet computer the
Redmond, Washington-based company developed that is powered by
its Windows operating system. The device will be available later
this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Times reported Acer&#8217;s comments earlier. Acer
is debating whether to continue relying on Microsoft software,
the newspaper reported, citing Campbell Kan, the Taiwan
company&#8217;s president for PC global operations. Wang said he
wasn&#8217;t able to confirm those comments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim O&#8217;Neill ushered in a decade-long
investment boom in 2001 when he coined the term BRICs for the
largest emerging markets. This year, a lesser-known acronym that
the Goldman Sachs Asset Management chairman is helping to
popularize has taken over for many investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called MIST nations -- Mexico, Indonesia, South
Korea and Turkey -- are the four biggest markets in the Goldman
Sachs N-11 Equity Fund. (GSYAX) Opened in February, 2011 to invest in
what O&#8217;Neill considers the next big 11 emerging markets, the
fund has climbed 12 percent this year, compared with a 1.5
percent gain in Goldman Sachs&#8217;s fund for Brazil, Russia, India
and China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see steady inflows into the Next 11 fund each week,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neill, 55, said in a phone interview from London. &#8220;It hasn&#8217;t
been affected by the disappointment in the U.S. and obviously
the European markets especially, and all the disappointment in
some of the BRIC markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Neill said he came up with the idea for an N-11 fund on a
trip to China and South Korea two years ago as a way to help
investors benefit from growth beyond the BRIC nations that had
dominated emerging markets investing. With populations that for
the most part are younger than the U.S. and Europe and have
higher birth rates, fueling economic expansion, the N-11 nations
are emerging from the shadow of the BRICs, where growth is
slowing and investors are pulling out funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Outpacing BRIC &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MIST economies more than doubled in size in the past
decade, topping Germany last year. In Mexico, Latin America&#8217;s
second-biggest economy, record auto exports are helping growth
outpace Brazil&#8217;s for a second year amid waning Chinese demand
for the South American nation&#8217;s commodities. Indonesia&#8217;s
domestic spending and investment helped the nation&#8217;s economic
growth accelerate to 6.37 percent in the second quarter,
surprising economists who forecast a slowdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the MIST nations, the N-11 countries include
Bangladesh, Egypt, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines and
Vietnam. Iran is also a member, though Goldman Sachs says its
fund doesn&#8217;t invest in Iran because it isn&#8217;t an open market for
foreign investors. The nation is subject to sanctions imposed by
the U.S. and European Union over its nuclear program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s N-11 fund has beaten 93 percent of U.S.-
based emerging-market equity funds this year, while the BRIC
fund has lagged 89 percent of them, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The N-11 fund has still trailed its benchmark, the
MSCI GDP Weighted Next 11 ex-Iran Index, which has climbed 17
percent this year. The MSCI BRIC Index (MXBRIC) has risen 1.7 percent
this year, more than the 1.5 percent gain for the Goldman Sachs
BRIC fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fuelling Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While outperforming them in growth this year, the MIST
nations don&#8217;t approach the BRICs in economic output or
population. Total GDP for the MIST nations was $3.9 trillion
last year, less than one third of the $13.5 trillion BRIC
economies and compared with $7.3 trillion for China alone,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In population, the MIST
nations have fewer than 500 million people, compared with about
2.9 billion in the BRIC nations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s N-11 fund had $113 million in assets and
was invested in 73 stocks at the end of the second quarter,
while the New York-based bank&#8217;s BRIC fund had $410 million in
assets and held 72 stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While O&#8217;Neill isn&#8217;t involved in either fund&#8217;s management,
they were built to capture economic growth in the nations he
identified as likely to make the greatest increased contribution
to global GDP. The MIST nations accounted for about 73 percent
of N-11 GDP last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Paying Off &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment strategy is paying off. Mexico&#8217;s benchmark
IPC Index (MEXBOL) has climbed 11 percent this year, compared with a 2.8
percent gain in Brazil&#8217;s Bovespa. (IBOV) Turkey&#8217;s ISE National 100
Index (XU100) has surged 28 percent and Indonesia&#8217;s Jakarta Composite
Index (JCI) has gained 7.4 percent, while South Korea&#8217;s Kospi (KOSPI) has
increased 3.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX) is the best-performing among
BRICs equity benchmarks, increasing 13 percent, compared with a
2.6 percent gain in Russia&#8217;s Micex Index (INDEXCF) and a 2 percent drop in
the Shanghai Composite Index. (SHCOMP) By comparison, the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 Index (SPX) is up 11 percent this year, while the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index (SXXP) has climbed 9.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;ve seen a rotation in the leadership based on rate of
economic growth,&#8221; said Paul Christopher, the St. Louis-based
chief international strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors, the
third-largest U.S. brokerage with $1.2 trillion in client
assets. &#8220;If you go back as far as just 2009, you&#8217;ll find people
buying the BRIC story in a big way, and probably over-buying the
BRIC story.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pouring in Money &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors poured about $67 billion into BRIC stocks from
2001 to 2010 as they beat the SP 500 by 281 percentage points.
They withdrew about $15 billion last year, the most on an annual
basis since at least 1996, according to Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based research firm EPFR Global. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, equity funds investing in the MIST nations haven&#8217;t
been immune from global growth concern. While investors added a
net $104 million to funds focused on Turkey and $123 million to
Indonesian funds this year through Aug. 1, they withdrew $1.33
billion from South Korea and $115 million from Mexico, EPFR
says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MIST nations each account for at least 1 percent of
global GDP and are likely to see that share increase this
decade, O&#8217;Neill said. Of the four countries, O&#8217;Neill said Mexico
and Turkey are the most attractive at the moment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Low-Cost &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico is increasingly competing with China for
manufacturing as costs climb in the Asian nation, O&#8217;Neill said.
Mexico&#8217;s economy grew 4.6 percent in the first three months of
2012, the fastest pace in six quarters, on increased shipments
to the U.S. America Movil SAB (AMXL), the wireless carrier controlled
by billionaire Carlos Slim, the world&#8217;s richest person according
to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, was the top holding in the
N-11 fund at 7.9 percent at the end of June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil, which grew at an average 3.7 percent annual rate
from 2000 through 2010, trumping Mexico&#8217;s 2.1 percent expansion,
is forecast to grow less than 3 percent for a second straight
year in 2012, according to the median estimate of analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo&#8217;s Christopher advised investors to sell stocks
in the BRIC nations at points in the first half of the year and
recommends buying equities in Indonesia, where economic growth
has exceeded 6 percent for seven quarters. Plans by the
government in Southeast Asia&#8217;s largest economy to build
railways, airports and seaports to bind its islands closer
together are helping to counter a slowdown in European demand
for commodities exports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher also recommends buying stocks in South Korea,
which he says will benefit from rising exports as China&#8217;s
domestic spending climbs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Credit Rating &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fitch Ratings and Moody&#8217;s Investors Service have raised
Indonesia&#8217;s debt to investment grade in the past eight months,
with Fitch increasing it to BBB- in December and Moody&#8217;s lifting
it to Baa3 in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The credit outlook in India is moving in the opposite
direction. India&#8217;s economy grew 5.3 percent in the first
quarter, the least in nine years, and SP warns that the country
may be downgraded unless growth picks up and political
roadblocks to decision-making are overcome. A blackout left 640
million people in India without light on July 31, a day after a
separate power cut left 360 million people without electricity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India is suffering from &#8220;an absence of effective
leadership,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said. &#8220;India always is very proud of the
fact it&#8217;s the biggest democracy in the world, but as I
frequently joke with them, India&#8217;s democracy is so good that it
doesn&#8217;t work.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A phone call to the Indian embassy in Washington seeking
comment wasn&#8217;t immediately returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Open Economies &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the exception of China, all the MIST nations ranked
higher on the Geneva-based World Economic Forum&#8217;s 2012 trade
openness index than the BRIC countries. While South Korea was
ranked 34 out of 132 and Indonesia 58th, Russia trailed in
position 112 and India at 100. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkish stocks have rallied after the government cut its
fiscal deficit to 1.3 percent of GDP last year from 3.6 percent
in 2010, garnering a credit rating upgrade by Moody&#8217;s on June 20
to Ba1, one level below investment grade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia&#8217;s $1.8 trillion economy, after unexpectedly
accelerating in the first quarter, is feeling the squeeze from
oil prices that plunged as much as 22 percent this year. The
price of crude pared its losses in July and is now down 6.7
percent since the end of December. Russia relies on oil and gas
exports for half of its budget revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Russia&#8217;s Economy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former finance minister Alexei Kudrin said on May 24 that
Russia&#8217;s economy has a 50 percent chance of slipping into
recession due to the crisis in Europe, the buyer of more than
half its exports. Russia&#8217;s gross domestic product may grow as
much as 4 percent this year, more than the government&#8217;s previous
projection of 3.4 percent, Economy Minister Andrei Belousov said
on July 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While O&#8217;Neill includes South Korea in the MIST grouping,
the nation differs from the other three in demographics,
development and wealth. Known as one of the Asian Tigers as it
grew an average 9 percent from the 1970s until the Asian
financial crisis in 1997, South Korea will expand 2.9 percent
this year, according to the median estimate of analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Aging Society &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea lacks the youth that O&#8217;Neill says will help
drive growth in the other MIST nations. Only about 16 percent of
South Korea&#8217;s population is under the age of 15, compared with
at least 25 percent in Mexico, Indonesia and Turkey, according
to estimates by the New York-based United Nations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea &#8220;happens to be the only populated country that
in my lifetime has transformed its income from that of an
African country to being that of a G-7 country,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said.
&#8220;It&#8217;s an example that all these other countries can learn
from.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MIST nations may not outperform the BRICs for long,
especially now that China&#8217;s government is stepping in to prime
the economy, O&#8217;Neill said. Moreover, the Shanghai Composite&#8217;s
decline has left it valued at 9.6 times estimated profit,
compared with the three-year average of 14.7. The MSCI BRIC
Index trades for about 9 times estimated profit, compared with
13.5 times for the SP 500, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Economic Weight &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent underperformance in BRIC equities isn&#8217;t reason
to give up on the long-term potential of economies that grew at
an average pace four times faster than the U.S. from 2001
through 2010, O&#8217;Neill said. He forecasts that the BRIC nations
will grow an average of about 6.5 percent a year through 2020,
compared with 5.5 percent for the N-11 group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Neill says he has three times turned down requests from
Goldman Sachs salespeople to start a fund focused only on the
MIST countries, and not only for economic reasons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You get very large exposure to them in the N-11 fund,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neill said. &#8220;I&#8217;m also quite cognizant of not going down in
history as being the guy that just constantly created
acronyms.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York police will be able to
search for criminal suspects with cameras and license-plate
readers through a new system developed in partnership with
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the city said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Police Department worked with Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft, the world&#8217;s biggest software maker,
to develop the Domain Awareness System, which aggregates and
analyzes information from cameras, license-plate readers,
sensors and law enforcement databases, according to a statement
today from Mayor Michael Bloomberg&#8217;s office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The system is a transformative tool because it was
created by police officers for police officers,&#8221; NYPD
Commissioner Raymond Kelly said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system was unveiled by Bloomberg and Kelly at the
headquarters of the Lower Manhattan Security Initiative a few
blocks south of Wall Street, where personnel from the NYPD and
its partners examine feeds from surveillance cameras, alerts
from license-plate readers and reports from 911 calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are about 3,000 closed-circuit television cameras
connected to the Domain Awareness System, most of which are
located in lower and midtown Manhattan, along with 2,600
radiation detectors carried by officers on patrol and several
hundred license-plate readers mounted on police cars and
deployed at bridges, tunnels and streets, Bloomberg said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gasoline refiners, shunned by
investors because of falling demand and rising regulation, now
count Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and billionaire
Carl Icahn among shareholders as lower oil prices promise wider
returns for fuel makers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. refiners such as Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) have delivered 10
times the returns of Exxon Mobil Corp., gaining an average 43
percent to Exxon&#8217;s 4.2 percent and outperforming every other
energy sector in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. Gushing shale
wells from North Dakota to the U.S.-Mexico border have lowered
costs and more than doubled profit margins on gasoline and
diesel production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett&#8217;s firm and Icahn are among bullish investors buying
into refining stocks as analysts forecast a new era of profits
akin to the industry&#8217;s so-called &#8220;golden age&#8221; in the mid
2000&#8217;s, when rising global demand and tight capacity lifted
earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The prospects for U.S. refiners have turned around
dramatically,&#8221; said John Auers, senior vice president of Turner
Mason  Co., a Dallas-based energy consulting company. &#8220;Cheap
crude has given an advantage to the U.S. refining system,
already the most advanced, most complex and most efficient in
the world.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valero and Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC) are among refiners
whose discount to stocks in an SP 500 index of 45 energy
companies have narrowed this year, showing that investors have
growing confidence that their earnings will rise. Since January,
the gap has shrunk by more than 30 percent for both companies on
a price to earnings basis, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Surpassing Estimates &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phillips 66, Tesoro Corp. (TSO) and other independent refiners
surpassed Wall Street expectations for second-quarter earnings,
while big integrated oil companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and
Chevron Corp. relied on their refineries to help counter the
sting of declining crude and natural-gas profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a different picture just last year. Exxon, Chevron
and Hess Corp. (HES) shed refining capacity by selling or closing
plants in response to reduced fuel demand in the U.S. and
western Europe. Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO) spun off its refining unit to
focus on production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refiners in Europe and the U.S. East Coast threatened to
close or shut down more than 2 million barrels a day of capacity
as rising oil prices overwhelmed profit margins and debt costs
soared amid the financial crisis. Petroplus Holdings AG, a
European refiner, filed for insolvency in January and shut or
sold off its plants. Hovensa LLC, a partnership of Hess Corp.
and Petroleos de Venezuela SA, shut its St. Croix refinery in
the U.S. Virgin Islands in February. Valero idled its Aruba
plant, which powers its operations with crude, in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Improving Value &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current rebound is driven by lower costs from abundant
oil and gas supplies, increased exports and more willingness by
refining companies to improve value through share buybacks and
dividends, according to energy analysts including Deutsche Bank
AG&#8217;s Paul Sankey and Barclays Plc&#8217;s Paul Cheng. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icahn, an activist investor, in January bought a stake in
CVR Energy Inc. (CVI), a refiner formerly owned by Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS), and agitated for executives to put the company up for
sale.  He offered investors $30 a share and obtained an 82
percent stake in the company. After no buyer materialized, on
Aug. 6 he offered to buy the remaining CVR shares for $29
apiece. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Buffett&#8217;s Bet &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett, Berkshire&#8217;s chairman and chief executive officer,
said last month in an interview on Bloomberg Television that one
of his deputies had invested in Phillips 66, which became the
largest independent refiner in the U.S. after the Houston-based
company was spun off from ConocoPhillips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icahn didn&#8217;t respond to a request for comment. Buffett
didn&#8217;t respond to a request for comment sent to his assistant,
Carrie Sova. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New drilling and production techniques used to crack shale
rock brought a flood of new gas, deflating prices to a 10-year
intraday low of $1.902 per million British thermal unit in
April. The same methods now are being used to harvest oil,
spurring three straight years of surging output in the U.S., the
first time that&#8217;s happened since 1985, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The renaissance has caused U.S. crude prices to fall below
other varieties of oil traded globally, giving refiners with
operations near new U.S. oil production the advantage of paying
less for each barrel they purchase. Refiners with access to
growing supplies from North Dakota&#8217;s Bakken shale formation and
other northwest oilfields, were the first to benefit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Soaring Profit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit at HollyFrontier Corp. (HFC), which owns refineries close
to many new U.S. oil wells, jumped to $1.02 billion in 2011,
seven times more than a year earlier. Marathon, which also has
several plants in the Midwest, earned $2.39 billion in 2011,
nearly four times higher than in 2010, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The competitive advantage has begun to extend to the U.S.
Gulf Coast, where oil from Texas&#8217;s Permian basin and Eagle Ford
formation is helping reduce imports and boost refining margins
in a region that holds about half the country&#8217;s refining
capacity. The margin between the cost of oil and the price at
which Gulf Coast refiners sell fuel reached $25.10 a barrel in
July, more than double the difference in December, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As domestic demand declined, the U.S. exported more
gasoline, diesel and other fuels than it imported in 2011 for
the first time since 1949, according to the U.S. Energy
Department. Exports may rise by 450,000 barrels a day by 2015,
according to energy research firm Wood Mackenzie Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Growing Exports &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our most efficient refineries are located on the Gulf
Coast, and that&#8217;s our access to world markets,&#8221; said Ed Hirs, a
professor of energy economics at the University of Houston.
&#8220;They can buy oil cheaply domestically, and they do, and they
can sell it at the world price. That&#8217;s why refiners have such
high profits right now.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors are finding refining stocks more attractive as
companies turn to share buybacks to reduce volatility and eschew
the plant-buying sprees of years past in favor of higher
dividends, said Timothy Parker, a Baltimore-based portfolio
manager who oversees about $6.5 billion in natural-resource
stocks for T. Rowe Price Group Inc. T. Rowe owns nearly 11
million Valero shares, or about 1.9 percent of the San Antonio-
based company, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;ve been more shareholder friendly,&#8221; said Parker. T.
Rowe owns nearly 11 million Valero shares, or about 1.9 percent
of the San Antonio-based company. The firm increased its
holdings in Valero by 8.4 million shares in the first quarter of
this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. lost a
bid for a revised ruling on its $8.6 billion lawsuit against
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) when the judge said he was satisfied with
the way he had dealt with the issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck in April dismissed some of
the defunct investment bank&#8217;s claims, leaving others in place.
Lehman, which is gathering money for a second payment to
creditors, said it might gain hundreds of millions of dollars if
he reinstated some claims he dismissed. Peck declined in an
order signed yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a July 12 hearing, Peck told Lehman it had other ways of
recovering money from JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I see absolutely no reason now to revisit the
questions,&#8221; Peck said, according to a transcript. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman alleges that the New York-based lender helped cause
its 2008 collapse by demanding $8.6 billion in collateral.
JPMorgan said in February it would give Lehman almost
$700 million to settle part of the suit. It continues to fight
most of Lehman&#8217;s claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two parties also are fighting over a demand by
JPMorgan, a key lender to Lehman in the 2008 credit crisis, for
$6.3 billion it says it is owed. Peck said at the hearing this
fight was one of the ways for Lehman to recover money from the
bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Judge&#8217;s Ruling &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peck&#8217;s April ruling was that Lehman cannot claim money from
JPMorgan for securities transactions governed by so-called safe
harbor law, devised to protect banks dealing with weak
companies. Lehman is entitled to pursue the remaining &#8220;fact
driven causes of action,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history in
September 2008, listing $613 billion in debt. Now out of
bankruptcy, it has said it expects to pay creditors 18 cents on
the dollar by 2016 or so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimberly Macleod, a Lehman spokeswoman, declined to comment
immediately on Peck&#8217;s decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit is Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. v. JPMorgan
Chase Bank NA, 10-03266, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Lynn Doan" date="Aug 08, 2012  4:24 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-08/chevron-said-to-cut-california-gasoline-production-after-fire.html"><headline>Chevron Said to Cut California Gasoline Production After Fire</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s Richmond refinery,
the largest in northern California, is running a gasoline-making
unit at about 60 percent capacity following an Aug. 6 fire that
shut the crude unit, a person familiar with production said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 240,000-barrel-a-day plant is operating the fluid
catalytic cracker, which processes vacuum gasoil into gasoline
and lighter products, off of feedstock stored in tanks, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the information
isn&#8217;t public. The refinery is also running one of two units at
an Isomax hydrocracking complex at 60 percent capacity and the
lube plant at low rates, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blaze, which brought down the crude unit indefinitely,
sent gasoline in San Francisco up 29.5 cents to 35 cents a
gallon above futures traded in New York yesterday, data compiled
by Bloomberg shows. That was the highest level in almost three
months and the largest single-day increase since at least
November 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melissa Ritchie, a Chevron spokeswoman at the refinery,
didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mailed request for comment.
She said in an e-mail today that the San Ramon, California-based
company was working to repair &#8220;affected equipment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery extinguished a second fire at the plant that
ignited at about 11:30 a.m. local time near the site of the Aug.
6 blaze, Ritchie said in a separate e-mail. Nobody was injured,
and the fire was put out within minutes, she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For millions of people suffering from
Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, an experimental drug from Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY)
may now be their last hope for treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pharmaceutical giants Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Johnson  Johnson (JNJ)
pulled the plug Aug. 6 on their joint development of a similar
Alzheimer&#8217;s therapy, after that drug failed to show any benefit
in two late-stage studies. Lilly has said it will release its
findings by the end of September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stakes are high both for the 5.4 million people in the
U.S. who have been diagnosed with Alzheimer&#8217;s and for Lilly.
There are no medicines on the market that slow the progression
of the disease, the most common form of dementia. If Lilly&#8217;s
drug proves a success, treatments could begin as early as next
year and the Indianapolis-based company could realize billions
of dollars in revenue. Still, company executives have warned
that a successful outcome for the drug, solanezumab, is a long
shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve said all along that solanezumab was a pretty risky
bet,&#8221; Derica Rice, Lilly&#8217;s chief financial officer, said at a
Goldman Sachs investor conference in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lilly could use a big win. It&#8217;s facing the loss of $7
billion in sales over the next five years from generic
competition to its two best-selling medicines. Lilly has spent
more than a decade and perhaps $1 billion or more studying the
drug. Yet after Pfizer and JJ pulled out, investors give the
Lilly drug a less than 20 percent chance of success. Meanwhile,
newer treatments in development by other companies are still
years away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lilly&#8217;s shares rose less than 1 percent to $42.85 at 4 p.m.
New York time. Pfizer gained less than 1 percent to $23.83. JJ
gained less than 1 percent to $68.35. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Strategic Options &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A failure would come as a major setback for the company.
Lilly&#8217;s stock could drop by as much as 20 percent, wiping out
$10 billion in market value, said Jeffrey Holford, an analyst
with Jefferies Group Inc. in New York. It may also leave Lilly
putting the bulk of its profit toward trying to maintain its
dividend rather than investing in the company, he said in a
telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They really don&#8217;t have many strategic options if their
pipeline doesn&#8217;t work out,&#8221; Holford said. &#8220;They just have to
hope that it&#8217;s going to happen.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A positive finding may boost the shares as much as 35
percent and could transform the company, said Mark Schoenebaum,
an analyst with ISI Group in New York. He says the odds of the
drug getting sale approval are just 15 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Elusive Treatment &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Lilly drug works &#8220;it would be euphoria, crazy
party-time,&#8221; Schoenebaum said in a telephone interview. &#8220;It
could be the biggest upside surprise in the history of the
pharmaceutical and biotech industry.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Schoenebaum also said a happy outcome is unlikely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At least 90 percent of people give this a less than 50
percent chance of working,&#8221; Schoenebaum added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After years of research and billions invested by nearly
every major drug company, a cure or even a treatment to slow the
progression of Alzheimer&#8217;s remains elusive. Little is known
about what causes the disease and efforts to alter its course
are littered with failures. In 2010, Lilly halted work on
another Alzheimer&#8217;s drug in late-stage testing, and earlier this
year Pfizer ended development of a drug called Dimebon after it
failed to show a benefit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pfizer-JJ drug that failed earlier this week, called
bapineuzumab, and Lilly&#8217;s both target plaque that builds up in
the brains of Alzheimer&#8217;s patients that some believe may be the
cause of the disease. Lilly&#8217;s drug targets the floating plaque
while the Pfizer-JJ drug goes after the deposits of plaque.
There may be other factors as well, such as the over development
of a protein called tau. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Baxter&#8217;s Therapy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only other therapy on the immediate horizon that has
shown success against the illness in mid-stage human trials is
Baxter International Inc. (BAX)&#8217;s Gammagard. The product is an
expensive, relatively scarce treatment derived from donated
blood plasma that replaces antibodies in people whose immune
systems can&#8217;t protect them from infection. Results on whether it
could slow or stop the mind-robbing disease in a final-stage
study may be available next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Lilly remains far more vulnerable to a failure
on Alzheimer&#8217;s than its larger competitors. New York-based
Pfizer, with a market value of $178 billion, and New Brunswick,
New Jersey-based JJ, at $188 billion, have made big
acquisitions to help them overcome generic competition to their
top drugs. Yet much smaller Lilly, with a $50 billion market
capitalization, has yet to do a large deal to shore up its
pipeline of experimental drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Patent Protection &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lilly lost patent protection last year on its top-seller
Zyprexa for schizophrenia and will lose the patent next year for
its second-best seller, the anti-depressant Cymbalta. The drugs
combined accounted for 36 percent of Lilly&#8217;s 2011 revenue. Lilly
Chief Executive Officer John Lechleiter has said the company&#8217;s
revenue will not be less than $20 billion and its profits will
remain more than $3 billion through 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting in 2015, sales and revenue will begin to grow
again, he said on a conference call last month with analysts
without specifying by how much. In 2011, Lilly brought in
revenue of $24.3 billion with a profit of $4.35 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from its Alzheimer&#8217;s drug, Lilly has 11 other
medicines in late-stage testing, six of which could eventually
have more than $1 billion each in peak annual sales, Holford
said. Sales from those drugs won&#8217;t come soon enough to offset
the losses Lilly faces through at least 2017, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Placing Bets &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without the Alzheimer&#8217;s drug, the percentage of profit
going to the dividend would rise to 79 percent in 2014 from 44
percent in 2011, much higher than the payout ratio of other
drugmakers, he said. Lilly pays a quarterly dividend of 49 cents
a share and had 1.16 billion shares outstanding as of the end of
the second quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lilly&#8217;s drug could generate $7 billion in annual sales if
it works in a broad population of Alzheimer&#8217;s patients, said
Jami Rubin, an analyst at Goldman Sachs in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In anticipation of study results on solanezumab, traders
have been placing their bets in both directions. The number of
outstanding Lilly options that traders use to bet on the stock
have surged this year. The stock price has also gone up 18
percent in the past 12 months, outperforming the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500, in anticipation of the results, said Schoenebaum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Drugs move drug stocks, and Alzheimer&#8217;s disease is the
biggest therapeutic disease yet to be conquered,&#8221; said Rubin,
who expects Lilly&#8217;s stock could go up as much as 30 percent on a
positive finding or drop 14 percent on a negative result. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lechleiter said investors should stick with Lilly because
its pipeline of experimental drugs will get profits growing
after 2014. He has also been cutting costs by firing 5,500
workers and trying to expand sales in Japan and emerging markets
such as China where Lilly has a new research center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We know that ultimately, this is about getting back to
growth and the only way to do that is build our pipeline, which
we&#8217;ve done,&#8221; Lechleiter said in an interview earlier this year.
&#8220;Those molecules, those future products, hopefully, will be the
things that drive us back to growth as we come out of this
period.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bancolombia SA (BCOLO), the country&#8217;s biggest
lender, dropped to a two-year low after Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
said it sees a &#8220;rough road ahead&#8221; for the company and cut its
price target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares dropped 1.7 percent to 24,780 pesos at 3:42 p.m.
in Santiago and earlier declined 4 percent to 24,220, the lowest
intraday price since July 2010. Bancolombia has retreated 10
percent since reporting a surprise decrease in second-quarter
profit on Aug. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs cut the target price on Bancolombia&#8217;s
American Depositary Receipts by 9.6 percent to $62.10 as
analysts led by Carlos G. Macedo cited lower loan growth
estimates and an increase in provisions for bad loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to see a rough road ahead for Bancolombia,&#8221;
the analysts wrote, with &#8220;little risk-adjusted upside,
particularly if the near-term outlook remains as difficult&#8221; as
indicated by the second-quarter results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income fell 8 percent in the three months through June
to 354.5 billion pesos ($198.4 million), surprising analysts
whose average projection was for an adjusted profit of 414
billion pesos, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The
bank forecasts loan growth at the lower end of a 10 percent to
15 percent range this year, officials said on an Aug. 2
conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grupo Aval Acciones y Valores SA, the banking group
controlled by billionaire Luis Carlos Sarmiento Angulo, overtook
Bancolombia&#8217;s market value on Aug. 3 for the first time since
March to become the country&#8217;s second-biggest company after
Ecopetrol SA. Bancolombia&#8217;s capitalization fell below Aval&#8217;s
again today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, agreed to pay $60.2 million to settle foreign bribery
cases it brought to U.S. authorities involving alleged payments
paid by employees and agents of subsidiaries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer entered into two agreements with the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the New York-based drugmaker reached a
deferred prosecution accord with the Department of Justice,
according to filings yesterday in federal court in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. law enforcement authorities have been probing
drugmakers for possibly breaking an overseas anti-bribery law
that bars employees or their agents from paying bribes to
foreign government officials to obtain or retain business.
Yesterday&#8217;s settlements stem from payments and gifts Pfizer said
its foreign units made to government-employed doctors and
workers in eastern Europe, China and the Middle East, according
to the filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC said the payoffs were made &#8220;without the knowledge
or approval of officers or employees of Pfizer, but the
inaccurate books and records of Pfizer subsidiaries were
consolidated in the financial reports of Pfizer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer alerted U.S. authorities in 2004 after probing the
claims. More payments were found when the drugmaker bought its
Wyeth unit in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The actions which led to this resolution were
disappointing, but the openness and speed with which Pfizer
voluntarily disclosed and addressed them reflects our true
culture and the real value we place on integrity and meeting
commitments,&#8221; Amy Schulman, Pfizer&#8217;s general counsel, said in
an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We expect every colleague across Pfizer
to adhere to the highest standards of conduct.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors agreed to defer prosecution and drop the
charges after two years if Pfizer continues to cooperate and
take remedial steps. The settlements must be approved by a
federal judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pfizer cases are U.S. Securities of Exchange Commission
v. Pfizer Inc., 12-cv-01303; U.S. Securities of Exchange
Commission v. Wyeth LLC, 12-cv-1304; and U.S. v. Pfizer HCP
Corp., 12-cr-00169, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia
(Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Halkbank CEO Aslan Says Turkey May Need to Act on Bad Loans &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkiye Halk Bankasi AS (HALKB) Chief Executive Officer Suleyman
Aslan said Turkey&#8217;s central bank and regulators may need to act
should bad loans in the nation&#8217;s financial system worsen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halkbank, as the lender is known, is Turkey&#8217;s biggest
listed state-run bank. Aslan, speaking in a televised interview
with the CNBC-e news channel yesterday, didn&#8217;t specify what
measures he wanted policymakers to take, though he said the
central bank&#8217;s average lending rate to banks was &#8220;rather
high.&#8221; He also said lenders&#8217; &#8220;asset structures are not
breaking down&#8221; as a result of bad loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkey&#8217;s economic growth is forecast to slow to 2.3 percent
this year from 8.5 percent in 2011, the International Money Fund
said in April, while central bank data shows non-performing
consumer loans rose 4.4 percent in the first six months of 2012
compared with a year earlier, led by unpaid credit-card bills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aslan yesterday forecast that the Turkish central bank will
ease monetary policy. Turkish banks&#8217; provisions may increase
this year because of non-performing loans caused by a slowdown
in the economy, Duygun Kutucu, an analyst at EFG Istanbul
Securities, said in a telephone interview on July 31 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ecuador Tightens Controls on Transfers to Maintain Liquidity &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecuador will boost controls on cash transfers by banks in
an attempt to maintain liquidity in the South American nation&#8217;s
financial system, central bank President Pedro Delgado said
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are keeping some foreign clients&#8217; funds in
international accounts to avoid paying a 5 percent capital-
export tax for money they need to move outside the country,
Delgado said to reporters in Quito. The controls will force
banks to increase the amount they bring into the country and
raise the amount of tax they pay to export cash, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with falling revenue as oil prices decline and
economic growth slows, the government said last month all cash
transfers into Ecuador must go through the central bank before
reaching their final destination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Standard Chartered Falls Most in 24 Years on N.Y. Iran Probe &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) fell the most in almost 24 years as
an analyst estimated it may face costs of $5.5 billion after
being accused of violating U.S. money laundering laws over its
dealings with Iranian banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard Chartered may lose its license to operate in New
York after the state&#8217;s Department of Financial Services found
the bank conducted $250 billion of deals with Iranian banks over
seven years and earned hundreds of millions of dollars in fees
for handling transactions for institutions subject to U.S.
economic sanctions. The London-based lender yesterday denied the
allegations, saying it &#8220;strongly rejects the position and
portrayal of facts&#8221; made by the regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank may be fined $1.5 billion by U.S. regulators, lose
about $1 billion of revenue from its Iranian operation and a
further $3 billion in market value if senior managers quit,
Cormac Leech, an analyst at London-based Liberum Capital Ltd.
who rates the stock a buy, wrote in a note to investors
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CFPB Eases Rules on Some International Money Transfers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has updated its
international money transfer rule to make the process easier for
community banks, credit unions, and financial institutions
handling 100 or fewer remittances a year, according to a
statement on the consumer bureau&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule implements protections provided under the Dodd-
Frank law requiring remittance transfer providers to disclose
upfront the fees, exchange rate, and the amount to be received.
The revised rule also provides consumers with rights when errors
or cancellations occur. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final remittance rule will take effect Feb 7, the
consumer bureau said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Morgan Stanley Derivative Accord Wins Approval in First Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) won approval of a $4.8 million accord with
the U.S. over claims it helped manipulate electricity prices, in
what the Justice Department called its first effort to get
disgorgement from a financial firm that used derivatives to aid
anticompetitive behavior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan turned
aside complaints from not-for-profits AARP and New York Public
Service Commission that under the agreement Morgan Stanley
didn&#8217;t have to admit wrongdoing and didn&#8217;t pay enough. Pauley,
citing the Justice Department, said the case marks the first
time the government filed an antitrust suit against a financial
firm involving derivative agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pauley wrote that deference to the government&#8217;s decision to
settle was appropriate, despite the &#8220;relatively mild
sanction,&#8221; because of the &#8220;novelty of the government&#8217;s
theory.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;An admission of liability is not a prerequisite for
judicial approval of an agency settlement,&#8221; Pauley said, citing
a recent ruling by a federal appeals court in a case involving
Citigroup Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary Claire Delaney, a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley,
declined to comment on the judge&#8217;s approval of the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Morgan Stanley, 11-6875, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Telkom South Africa Is Fined $55 Million in Antitrust Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telkom SA Ltd. (TKG) was fined 449 million rand ($55 million) for
abusing its dominance in South African telecommunications
between 1999 and 2004, less than the 3.25 billion rand the
Competition Commission had sought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Competition Tribunal &#8220;concluded that Telkom leveraged
its upstream monopoly in the facilities market to advantage its
own subsidiary in the competitive value added network market,&#8221;
the Pretoria-based tribunal said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telkom is studying the judgment and its implications, it
said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Competition Commission investigated Africa&#8217;s largest
fixed-line phone operator and asked the tribunal to impose a
fine of 3.25 billion rand at hearings that lasted until early
this year. The commission&#8217;s probe followed five separate
complaints of anti-competitive behavior lodged by Internet
service providers between 2005 and 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telkom, based in Pretoria, must pay half the penalty within
six months and the balance within the following 12 months, the
tribunal said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separately, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
should examine whether an emphasis on trading speed is
threatening the stock market, said Stifel Financial Corp. (SF) Chief
Executive Officer Ronald Kruszewski. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He made the remarks in an interview yesterday on Bloomberg
Television&#8217;s &#8220;Market Makers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These systems need to work 100 percent of the time. Speed
is not everything here.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stifel Financial, a St. Louis-based brokerage, was one of
six investors that agreed to buy $400 million of convertible
preferred securities in Knight Capital Aug. 7. Knight Capital,
led by Chairman and CEO Thomas Joyce, lost $440 million after a

Jersey-based company to take on trading positions it didn&#8217;t
want. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A former JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) banker
told jurors at a bid-rigging trial about a dinner meeting at a
Manhattan restaurant where municipal derivatives executives from
his firm and UBS AG (UBSN) agreed not to compete with one another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexander Wright took the witness stand in the criminal
trial of Peter Ghavami, the former head of UBS&#8217;s municipal
derivatives group, and told jurors about a dinner where bankers
from the two firms agreed to &#8220;forestall head-to-head
competition.&#8221; He said the meeting took place at Veritas,
possibly in early 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They discussed &#8220;ways the competition could be dulled&#8221; and
how to &#8220;keep other competitors away,&#8221; Wright told jurors today
in Manhattan federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright, 45, pleaded guilty last month to conspiracy to rig
bids on a bond deal and is testifying for prosecutors as part of
a plea deal for leniency. Two other men are also on trial: Garry
Heinz and Michael Welty, who were both vice presidents and
municipal reinvestment marketers. The three are charged with
conspiracy to defraud municipal-bond issuers and U.S. tax
authorities by fixing prices on investing agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dinner meeting aimed to ease the tension between the
municipal derivatives desks of New York-based JPMorgan and
Zurich-based UBS following UBS&#8217;s acquisition in 2000 of Paine
Webber, Wright said. Before then, JPMorgan had done deals with
Paine Webber, he said. That changed after UBS bought the smaller
firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Walled Off&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright said he, Ghavami and Heinz met at Veritas to
convince Wright&#8217;s boss, who was also there, that &#8220;this was a
good relationship,&#8221; he testified. At the dinner, the bankers
discussed clients and ways they could share them. In those
instances in which the two firms did compete, &#8220;that should be
walled off from the rest of the relationship,&#8221; Wright said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After recounting the dinner, Wright told jurors about
several transactions where, he said, JPMorgan and UBS disclosed
their secret bids to one another or agreed not to compete
against each other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One deal involved an effort in 2001 by the Greater Orlando
Aviation Authority in Florida to unwind a transaction it had
earlier entered into with JPMorgan. Wright said his desk badly
wanted the new deal and was worried that rival firms would drive
down the potential profit with competitive bids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We very much wanted to win,&#8221; Wright said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recorded Lines &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors played phone conversations from the firms&#8217;
recorded telephone lines in which bankers at the two firms UBS

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re gonna be coming in pretty aggressive,&#8221; one

&lt;p&gt;Jurors heard another call where Ghavami asks JPMorgan to

JPMorgan to vouch to a UBS client that the price UBS was
charging in a transaction was fair. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
computer programmer Sergei Aleynikov was charged under New York
law with stealing internal bank code after successfully fighting
similar federal accusations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov, 42, was arraigned today in Manhattan criminal
court on state charges of unlawful use of scientific material
and duplication of computer-related material, both felonies,
according to a statement from the office of Manhattan District
Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. He was released on $35,000 bail
immediately after court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This code is so highly confidential that it is known in
the industry as the firm&#8217;s &#8216;secret sauce,&#8217;&#8221; Vance said.
&#8220;Employees who exploit their access to sensitive information
should expect to face criminal prosecution in New York State in
appropriate cases.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov was freed earlier this year after his conviction
in Manhattan federal court for stealing the bank&#8217;s high-speed
trading code was reversed by a U.S. Court of Appeals in New
York. He had been convicted in December 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors claimed that, on his last day of work
at New York-based Goldman Sachs in June 2009, Aleynikov uploaded
hundreds of thousands of lines of source code from the firm&#8217;s
high-frequency trading system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Circumvented Security &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal government alleged that he circumvented Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s security, sent the code to a server in Germany,
compressed and encrypted it, and took it with him to a meeting
with new employers in Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. prosecutors said Aleynikov made about $400,000 a year
developing computer code for Goldman Sachs from 2007 to 2009.
They said he wanted the code as a &#8220;cheat sheet&#8221; to start a
system at his new job with Teza Technologies LLC, a trading firm
in Chicago that had offered him $1.2 million including salary,
bonus and profit sharing. Teza suspended Aleynikov after his
arrest and subsequently fired him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state allegations are similar to the federal
accusations and are based on the &#8220;same basic set of facts,&#8221;
said his attorney, Kevin Marino, of the firm of Marino
Tortorella PC in Chatham, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Aleynikov spent a year in prison for a federal crime
he did not commit,&#8221; Marino said in an interview before the
arraignment. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to imagine the authorities would find
it appropriate to pursue state charges arising from the same set
of facts. But apparently that is what they&#8217;ve decided to do. We
look forward to defending him.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Born in Russia &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Russia who
now lives in West Orange, New Jersey, was serving an eight-year
prison sentence at the time his conviction was overturned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A smiling, handcuffed Aleynikov appeared in court today
wearing a striped T-shirt, plaid shorts and sneakers. He
declined to comment to reporters after pleading not guilty to
the new charges before Judge Robert Mandelbaum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlawful use of scientific material and duplication of
computer-related materials are both class E felonies, which
carry a maximum sentence of four years in prison, according to
the New York state penal code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors asked the judge to impose $100,000 bail,
arguing that they secured an arrest warrant because they had
learned he was taking steps to recover his U.S. and Russian
passports that had been seized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Defense Attorneys &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marino asked Mandelbaum to release Aleynikov without bail,
saying his client intends to appear in court to defend himself
against the new charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov hasn&#8217;t been &#8220;gainfully employed&#8221; since he left
Goldman Sachs and ran out of money to defend himself before
trial, Marino, who said he&#8217;s representing Aleynikov
&#8220;voluntarily,&#8221; told the judge. Aleynikov&#8217;s marriage
&#8220;disintegrated&#8221; after his arrest and he sees his children
every other week, Marino said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s clearly a vindictive prosecution and we cannot wait
for the opportunity to first defend these charges and then
finally go on the offensive,&#8221; Marino said after the
arraignment. &#8220;Right now if you&#8217;re Sergei Aleynikov you&#8217;re
wondering, &#8216;Why would I ever leave Russia to come to the United
States?&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov is scheduled to return to court on Aug. 15, when
he will learn whether a grand jury has decided to indict him on
the new charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal case is U.S. v. Aleynikov, 11-1126, U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Christie Smythe" date="Aug 09, 2012  6:15 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-09/visa-mastercard-swipe-fee-plaintiffs-get-october-deadline-1-.html"><headline>Visa, MasterCard Swipe-Fee Plaintiffs Get October Deadline</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA)
plaintiffs in a lawsuit over swipe, interchange, fees have until
Oct. 19 to formally request approval of a more than $6 billion
settlement, according to a filing unsealed in Brooklyn, New
York, federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Magistrate Judge James Orenstein ordered that the
agenda be made public today following a hearing on the status of
the case, which was the first court appearance since the
settlement was unveiled last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal, which would settle allegations of interchange fee
price-fixing, promises to provide merchants with cash payments
as well as a temporary reduction in interchange fees and the
potential for surcharges to cover future interchange costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opposition to the accord has grown over the past few weeks,
with groups including the National Cooperative Grocers
Association and retail giants Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target
Corp. issuing statements saying the settlement doesn&#8217;t do enough
for merchants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are making progress and getting the underlying
documents drafted,&#8221; K. Craig Wildfang, an attorney for the
plaintiffs, said in court regarding a motion for approval of the
settlement. &#8220;We are going as fast as we can. Not as fast as we
would like.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Cooperative Grocers Association and the
National Association of Convenience Stores plan to fight the
settlement in court, Jeffrey Shinder, a lawyer for the groups,
said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Serious Issues&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are serious issues with the settlement,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;The trade association named plaintiffs who came out against
it, all of the members of their boards -- flesh and blood
merchants -- voted against it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The convenience store group, which issued its statement
within minutes of the settlement&#8217;s disclosure on July 13, said
the deal amounts to only two months&#8217; worth of roughly
$50 billion in swipe fees collected annually by payment
networks. The deal also doesn&#8217;t prevent Visa or MasterCard from
raising fees in the future, the group said. Other measures under
the deal would only be allowed under strict oversight of Visa
and MasterCard, making them &#8220;unworkable&#8221; for merchants, the
group said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Target said in a statement that the proposed settlement
would &#8220;perpetuate a broken system.&#8221; Wal-Mart said in a
statement that &#8220;we encourage all merchants to put consumers
first and reject the settlement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final Approval &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Chairman and CEO Joseph Saunders told investors in a
conference call on July 25 that he expected a federal judge to
grant preliminary approval to the settlement in the fall. The
court must also grant final approval to the deal before it can
be implemented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accord followed roughly a roughly a seven-year legal
battle, according to lawyers for the plaintiffs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This settlement agreement is the result of seven years of
negotiation which makes us confident that the court will agree
that this is fair to all parties,&#8221; Trish Wexler, a spokeswoman
for the Electronic Payments Coalition, which favors the deal,
said in an e-mail statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The recent statements that we&#8217;ve heard from a handful of
retailers are nothing new and have already been considered
during the course of this long negotiation,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant
Discount Antitrust Litigation, 05-md-01720, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Mary Childs and Michael J. Moore" date="Aug 09, 2012  4:23 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-09/morgan-stanley-follows-goldman-with-fixed-income-call.html"><headline>Morgan Stanley Follows Goldman With Fixed-Income Call</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) is retooling an
electronic bond-brokering system as the Wall Street bank with
the biggest drop in fixed-income revenue last quarter seeks to
increase its share in a market moving toward automated trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Morgan Stanley Bond Pool network picks a group of
securities and matches buyers and sellers who express interest
through the system, offering lower transaction costs than what
investors typically get in privately negotiated trades, the bank
said in marketing documents dated last month and obtained by
Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Created last year, the system was revamped and the bank
introduced the new version to clients within the past month,
according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to
be identified because the program hasn&#8217;t been made public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley joins Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and UBS AG (UBSN) in
starting automated systems to exchange bonds in an effort to
maintain their grip on transaction fees as investors from
Fidelity Investments to BlackRock Inc. (BLK) push for cheaper and
faster ways to trade debt. Networks run by firms from Bonds.com
Group Inc. (BDCG) to MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (MKTX) threaten to siphon off
the revenue Wall Street makes from the difference between offers
to buy and sell the securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary Claire Delaney, a spokeswoman for the New York-based
bank, declined to comment on the marketing documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Invited Clients&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Bond Pool, which is part of the global credit sales and
trading unit, Morgan Stanley traders submit market mid-prices
and conditional bids and offers for a set of bonds, according to
the marketing documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers are invited to bid, and the bank matches buyers
with sellers at the close of a specified time window. Market-
makers can fill any leftover interest. Sales teams at the bank
then approach participants with proposed trades, which the
parties have to agree to before the transaction is completed,
according to the presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sessions take place &#8220;as frequently as client and trader
interest dictate, and as quickly as&#8221; the system allows,
according to the documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The platform, which is offered through the firm&#8217;s Matrix
application, is the latest attempt by Morgan Stanley to use
technology to improve its fixed-income trading performance. The
firm started Matrix in 2009, which provided clients with
research, analytics, live prices and trading capability for some
fixed-income products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Curbing Risk &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm has expanded its Morgan Stanley Electronic Trading
technology, which was developed for equities and foreign
exchange, into fixed-income, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat
said last year. In 2010, it hired Dexter Senft from Barclays Plc
as head of e-commerce for the fixed-income unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The efforts support Chief Executive Officer James Gorman&#8217;s
goal of increasing market share while reducing so-called risk-
weighted assets in the fixed-income business, which the bank has
cut by 15 percent since the 2011&#8217;s third quarter. That reduction
will rise to 30 percent by the end of 2014, Gorman said last
month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley&#8217;s second-quarter fixed-income trading
revenue dropped 60 percent from a year earlier, excluding
accounting adjustments. That was the largest decline among the
five largest Wall Street banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment banks will bring down compensation costs by
dismissing trading staff as automated transactions become more
prevalent, Boston Consulting Group Inc. said in an April report.
The industry will see little to no growth in the total revenue
pool over the next few years, BCG said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest dealers have cut company-debt holdings by 84
percent since 2007, according to Federal Reserve data, even as
the size of the U.S. corporate bond market expanded 40 percent
in the past three years, average daily trading volumes dropped
about 1 percent, data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Goldman Sachs also has an initiative,
GSessions, which debuted in June. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
computer programmer Sergei Aleynikov, who successfully fought
federal allegations that he stole internal bank code, will be
arraigned on related state charges, his lawyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov will face charges in Manhattan criminal court of
copying scientific material, a felony, and fraudulent accosting,
a misdemeanor, defense attorney Kevin Marino said today in a
telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov was freed earlier this year after his conviction
in Manhattan federal court for stealing the bank&#8217;s high-speed
trading code was reversed by a U.S. appeals court in New York.
He had been convicted in December 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Aleynikov spent a year in prison for a federal crime
he did not commit,&#8221; said Marino, of the firm of Marino
Tortorella PC in Chatham, New Jersey. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to imagine the
authorities would find it appropriate to pursue state charges
arising from the same set of facts. But apparently that is what
they&#8217;ve decided to do. We look forward to defending him.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Last Day &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors claimed that, on his last day of work
at New York-based Goldman Sachs in June 2009, Aleynikov uploaded
hundreds of thousands of lines of source code from the firm&#8217;s
high-frequency trading system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal government alleged that he circumvented Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s security, sent the code to a server in Germany,
compressed and encrypted it, and took it with him to a meeting
with new employers in Chicago. Prosecutors argued Aleynikov
wanted it as a &#8220;cheat sheet&#8221; to start a trading system at his
new job. Aleynikov pleaded not guilty to the charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals in New York, which had ordered
Aleynikov freed from prison in Fort Dix, New Jersey, in February,
said the two laws federal prosecutors used to charge Aleynikov,
the National Stolen Property Act and the Economic Espionage Act,
didn&#8217;t apply to his case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We conclude that Aleynikov&#8217;s conduct did not constitute 
an offense under either the NSPA or the EEA, and that the 
indictment was therefore legally insufficient,&#8221; Chief U.S. 
Circuit Judge Dennis Jacobs wrote in the opinion, on behalf of 
two members of a three-judge panel. U.S. Circuit Judge Guido Calabresi filed a separate opinion agreeing that Aleynikov 
didn&#8217;t violate the laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Citizen &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Russia, was
serving an eight-year prison sentence at the time his conviction
was overturned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York state scientific copying charge, a class E
felony under state law, carries a maximum sentence of four years 
in prison, while the accosting charge, a type of fraud allegation, 
is a class A misdemeanor and carries a maximum term of one year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Petok, a spokesman for Manhattan District Attorney
Cyrus Vance Jr., and Michael DuVally, a spokesman at Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment on the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Aleynikov, 11-1126, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By David Scheer" date="Aug 09, 2012 10:54 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-09/goldman-says-sec-closes-probe-without-action-after-wells-notice.html"><headline>Goldman Says SEC Closed Probe of Firm After Threatening Case</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said U.S.
regulators ended an investigation of its role in selling $1.3
billion of mortgage-backed securities and won&#8217;t sue the firm,
reversing course after investigators warned in February that
they intended to recommend legal action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Securities and Exchange Commission lawyers told Goldman
Sachs on Aug. 6 that they no longer planned to pursue claims
against the bank, the New York-based company said today in a
regulatory filing. The regulator had sent Goldman Sachs a so-
called Wells notice in February, which typically gives
recipients a chance to dissuade investigators from recommending
the agency authorize enforcement action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC&#8217;s investigation looked at disclosures during the
late-2006 offering of subprime residential mortgage-backed
securities underwritten by Goldman Sachs, according to the
firm&#8217;s filing. It didn&#8217;t elaborate on the SEC&#8217;s decisions. David
Wells, a spokesman for the firm, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A separate SEC lawsuit in April of 2010, accusing Goldman
Sachs of misleading investors in the sale of securities that bet
on subprime mortgages, caused the firm&#8217;s stock to plunge 13
percent on the day it was filed and roiled the broader market.
The investment bank paid $550 million to settle the case in July
that year, saying it had made a &#8220;mistake&#8221; in omitting
disclosures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shares Rise &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets,
advanced 1.4 percent to $103.94 as of 10:34 a.m. in New York,
making it the second-best-performing bank in the Standard and
Poor&#8217;s 500 Financials Index of 81 companies including lenders,
brokerages and insurers. The shares have climbed 15 percent this
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four years after mounting mortgage defaults prompted
unprecedented government bailouts of the financial system,
regulators are still examining how banks packaged and sold home
loans to investors. The SEC is looking for evidence that firms
failed to disclose underlying credit weaknesses in mortgage
pools and delinquencies, Jason Anthony, special counsel for the
agency&#8217;s structured-products unit, said in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the largest U.S. bank, was warned by
SEC employees in January that they may recommend civil claims
from two inquiries, including one focusing on due diligence and
disclosures for two mortgage-backed securitizations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank said today in a filing that it has
submitted responses to the agency&#8217;s proposed actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Dawn Kopecki and Michael J. Moore" date="Aug 09, 2012 10:03 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-09/jpmorgan-probes-expand-to-at-least-11-agencies.html"><headline>JPMorgan Probes Expand to at Least 11 Agencies</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is being
investigated by at least 11 state, federal and international
enforcement bodies as the bank struggles to contain damage from
a botched derivatives trade that cost it at least $5.8 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authorities in Singapore, Germany and Japan have joined the
list of agencies probing the largest U.S. bank&#8217;s trading errors,
the company said in a regulatory filing today. The U.S. Justice
Department, Congress, Securities and Exchange Commission and
U.K. Financial Services Authority are among those examining the
bank, which could still lose as much as $1.7 billion more on its
credit derivatives portfolio, the company said. The bungled
trade may also make it more difficult to resolve other pending
reviews, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The firm expects heightened scrutiny by its regulators of
its compliance with new and existing regulations,&#8221; the company
said. Regulators will more frequently bring &#8220;formal enforcement
actions for violations of law rather than resolving those
violations through informal supervisory processes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank reiterated it found &#8220;material weakness&#8221; within
its internal controls and financial reporting related to the
trade and, as a result, its initial first-quarter results
couldn&#8217;t be relied on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight civil lawsuits have already been filed since the bank
initially disclosed problems in its synthetic credit derivatives
book on May 10, the bank said. It is &#8220;reasonably possible&#8221;
that JPMorgan&#8217;s legal troubles could exceed its litigation
reserves by as much as $5.3 billion as of June 30, the bank
said. The Justice Department and SEC are also among agencies
investigating the bank&#8217;s possible role in an international bid-
rigging scheme to manipulate the London interbank offered rate,
or Libor, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stock Slump &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s stock market value has declined by more than
$25 billion since Bloomberg News first reported April 5 that the
bank had amassed a large and illiquid position in credit
derivatives at its chief investment office in London. JPMorgan
was unchanged at $37.16 at 9:50 a.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56, ousted traders and
managers and overhauled the ranks of senior executives after
initially disclosing trading losses in May. Chief Investment
Officer Ina Drew retired days later, voluntarily forfeiting as
much as two years of compensation, and the New York-based
company said it would seek to claw back pay of other executives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank restated first-quarter results last month, paring
profit by $459 million, in part because an internal review
revealed that U.K. traders had priced their books
&#8220;aggressively,&#8221; Mike Cavanagh, who ran the investigation, told
analysts on July 13. Cavanagh, 46, was elevated in the shakeup
announced July 28 from head of Treasury and Security Services to
co-CEO of an expanded corporate and investment bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Credit Derivatives &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mispricing made losses on a portfolio of credit
derivatives look smaller than they were, and executives
concluded that traders may have sought to hide the &#8220;full amount
of losses,&#8221; JPMorgan said in a presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to restate results was made one day before
JPMorgan reported second-quarter net income of $4.96 billion,
and after executives and lawyers interviewed employees, and
reviewed thousands of hours of calls and about 1 million e-
mails, Cavanagh said in the call last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan ended synthetic trading at the chief investment
office and transferred the rest of the position to the
investment bank, executives said last month. The CIO retained an
$11 billion short position in &#8220;basically liquid indexes&#8221; to
hedge other credit assets, Dimon said during a July 13 meeting
with analysts. Positions in Series 9 of the Markit CDX North
America Investment Grade Index, a credit-swaps benchmark known
as IG9 that&#8217;s at the heart of much of the loss, were cut by 70
percent, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Down Substantially&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank transferred about $30 billion of risk-weighted
assets from the CIO to the investment bank, an amount that&#8217;s
&#8220;down substantially&#8221; from an earlier peak and back to levels
at the end of 2011, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine said July 14 that he&#8217;s
seeking to lead a proposed class-action against JPMorgan after
state pension funds lost more than $27.5 million due to the
&#8220;alleged fraud.&#8221; Two funds for state employees held about 10.2
million JPMorgan shares as of March 31, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon transformed the unit in recent years to boost profit
by buying higher-yielding assets such as structured credit,
equities and derivatives, Bloomberg News reported on April 13,
citing former employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon dismissed initial news reports about the London
operation as a &#8220;tempest in a teapot&#8221; when the bank reported
first-quarter results April 13. He reversed course less than
four weeks later, disclosing a $2 billion loss that he said
could grow to $3 billion or more during the quarter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. credit-card lender, will contribute about $1.2 billion to
settle a price-fixing case brought by retailers over credit-card
swipe fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan agreed to cover about 20 percent of a $6.05
billion deal to settle claims that the bank conspired with
MasterCard Inc. (MA) and Visa Inc. (V) to rig credit-card processing
fees, the New York-based bank said today in a filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa and MasterCard, the world&#8217;s biggest payment networks,
and some of the largest U.S. banks agreed last month to pay
merchants $6.6 billion and temporarily reduce credit-card swipe
fees, or interchange, to settle the antitrust lawsuit. The deal
includes cash payments of $6.05 billion to merchants who take
part in the proposed class action and $525 million to individual
plaintiffs. The larger amount would be reduced if some
plaintiffs don&#8217;t agree to participate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the second-biggest U.S. credit-card
lender, said last week that it will contribute a total of $738
million to settle the case. Citigroup Inc. (C), the No. 3 card
issuer, said in an Aug. 3 filing that second-quarter expenses at
its North America consumer bank climbed 5 percent to $2.45
billion, an increase &#8220;driven entirely&#8221; by a boost in legal
reserves tied to the litigation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank by assets, said it hopes to resume repurchases of its
stock in the first quarter, moving back a target set last month
by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, 56, had told analysts July 13 that the New York-
based lender may restart buybacks in this year&#8217;s fourth quarter,
&#8220;if all goes well.&#8221; Today, the bank said it &#8220;hopes to recommence 
its equity repurchase program in the first quarter of 2013.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing so depends on the board&#8217;s completion of work on the
chief investment office, which lost $5.8 billion on wrong-way
bets in this year&#8217;s first half, and on the Federal Reserve&#8217;s
view of the bank&#8217;s resubmitted capital plan, JPMorgan said today
in a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s shares fell 1.6 percent to $36.55 in early
trading in New York. The stock has advanced 12 percent this
year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) posted more
unprofitable trading days than any quarter since the depth of
the financial crisis as the largest U.S. bank struggled to
unwind credit-derivatives bets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traders lost money on 28 days in the second quarter,
compared with one day in the first three months of the year, New
York-based JPMorgan said today in a regulatory filing. That was
more than in all of 2011 and the most since 37 days of losses in
the fourth quarter of 2008, after the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. roiled global markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56, ousted traders and
managers and overhauled the ranks of senior executives amid $5.8
billion in losses on a trading position at the chief investment
office in London. The losses prompted the retirement of Chief
Investment Officer Ina Drew and spurred shareholder lawsuits and
probes by the U.S. Justice Department, Federal Bureau of
Investigation and Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank &#8220;appreciably reduced the risk profile&#8221; of the
derivatives portfolio during the quarter, JPMorgan said in the
filing. It said the portfolio &#8220;under certain extreme, simulated
scenarios&#8221; could lose as much as an additional $1.7 billion,
the same figure Dimon gave last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So-called value-at-risk, or VaR, which measures how much
the bank estimates it could lose on 95 percent of its trading
days, increased to $201 million during the second quarter from
an average of $94 million during the same period last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exceeding VaR &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three of the daily losses during the second quarter
exceeded the firm&#8217;s VaR because of the synthetic credit
portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traders in JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bank, chief investment
office and mortgage unit posted gains exceeding $200 million on
two days in the second quarter, compared with one day in the
previous period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley traders incurred losses on 15 days during
the second quarter, with none exceeding $50 million, the New
York-based company said in an Aug. 6 filing. Bank of America
Corp., the second-largest U.S. lender, recorded trading losses
on three days in the quarter, with the biggest at $11 million,
the Charlotte, North Carolina-based firm said last week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, cut its holdings of Italian
sovereign debt by 92 percent in the second quarter after
boosting them in the first three months of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Market exposure&#8221; to Italian government bonds fell to
$191 million at the end of June from $2.51 billion at the end of
March, the New York-based firm said in a quarterly regulatory
filing today. Goldman Sachs also increased its credit-derivative
positions on Italy in the quarter, pushing its total market
exposure to Italian government and non-government securities to
negative $977 million from positive $2.4 billion in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs discloses the firm&#8217;s credit and market stance
for Italy, Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain each quarter
because those five countries are viewed by investors as Europe&#8217;s
riskiest. The filing today showed that the firm&#8217;s total market
exposure to the five countries also swung to a negative $977
million as of June from a positive $2.68 billion three months
earlier as the bank reduced its position in bonds and stocks and
purchased more credit derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Credit exposure,&#8221; which measures the risk from a default
or credit deterioration of the counterparty or borrower,
increased to $3.35 billion for the five countries from $2.52
billion in March, the filing showed. The jump reflected a boost
in the firm&#8217;s credit exposure to Spain to $1.67 billion from
$639 million in March, mostly from an increase in non-sovereign
exposure, the filing showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derivatives include credit-default swaps, which act like
insurance to reimburse a bondholder when a borrower fails to
meet its obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs disclosed that it had written a total of
$154.4 billion in notional credit derivatives for the five
countries as of June and had purchased $165.2 billion. The
company said that &#8220;substantially all&#8221; of the purchased
derivatives were from investment-grade counterparties that are
domiciled outside of those five European countries and are
collateralized with cash or U.S. Treasury securities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank, said it had a &#8220;material weakness&#8221; in its financial
reporting during the first quarter that has since been
corrected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan restated first-quarter results after discovering
that traders in London &#8220;may have been seeking to avoid showing
the full amount of the losses&#8221; in a synthetic credit book
during the first quarter, the New York-based company said in a
regulatory filing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internal reporting controls were &#8220;substantially
remediated&#8221; by June 30, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI), India&#8217;s largest
mobile-phone operator, sank to the lowest price in almost six
years after brokerages including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut
the stock&#8217;s rating on concerns the company&#8217;s expenses may rise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bharti slumped 6.4 percent to 256.75 rupees, the lowest
close since Oct. 26, 2006, and the biggest loser today on the
BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX) and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.
The stock slid 6.6 percent yesterday after reporting earnings
that missed analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Standard Chartered Plc cut their ratings
on expectation the company will have to boost promotion costs as
it seeks to grow market share in India and Africa. Bharti,
controlled by billionaire Chairman Sunil Mittal, said yesterday
that telecommunications revenue in India were depressed because
of &#8220;hyper-competition&#8221; and higher network costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The disappointment was more on costs, than on revenue,&#8221;
Standard Chartered analysts Rahul Singh and Saurav Anand said in
a note dated yesterday. The brokerage lowered its rating to in-
line from outperform and reduced the price target to 274.35
rupees from 300 rupees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bharti&#8217;s net income will see an impact from competition for
the next 12 to 15 months, compared with the six to nine months
predicted earlier, the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Price cuts and promotions offered by Bharti to regain its
market share locally will spur &#8220;aggressive responses&#8221; from
rivals, wrote Sachin Salgaonkar, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, in
a note to clients yesterday. He cut the rating to neutral from
buy, adding the &#8220;aggressive spend&#8221; will impact the company&#8217;s
profitability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bharti&#8217;s Nigerian unit invested $1.2 billion in the past
two years to expand its business in Africa&#8217;s most populous
country, the Lagos-based company said today by e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Christine Harper" date="Aug 09, 2012  6:32 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-09/goldman-lifts-reasonably-possible-legal-loss-estimate.html"><headline>Goldman Lifts &#8216;Reasonably Possible&#8217; Legal-Loss Estimate</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, raised its estimate for potential
losses from legal claims by 26 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Reasonably possible&#8221; legal costs are as much as $3.4
billion, the New York-based firm said today in a report on the
quarter that ended June 30, without giving specific reasons for
the jump. That compares with $2.7 billion three months earlier.
The estimate is the highest since the firm&#8217;s $3.4 billion
forecast for Dec. 31, 2010, which was the first time the firm
supplied a figure for potential legal expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks started releasing estimates of possible losses after
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission told finance chiefs
in October 2010 that they should disclose such costs &#8220;when
there is at least a reasonable possibility&#8221; they may be
incurred, even if the risk is too low to require reserves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estimate doesn&#8217;t include potential losses from legal
matters that are at an early stage or where the firm can&#8217;t
determine the potential amount, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
relies on trading for more than half its revenue, posted losses
from that business on six days in the second quarter, down from
15 days in the same period last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s traders made more than $100 million on four of
the 63 days in the quarter ended June 30, compared with one day
in the year-earlier period, the New York-based company said in a
quarterly regulatory filing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, last
month reported its lowest first-half revenue since 2005 as
revenue from trading stocks, bonds and other securities dropped
6 percent from a year earlier. That followed a 21 percent
decline in trading revenue for all of 2011, the worst
performance since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading losses during the second quarter never exceeded
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s value-at-risk limit, a measure of how much the
company estimates it could lose in the securities markets in a
single day, according to the filing. Average daily value-at-risk
dropped to $92 million in the three months ended June 30 from
$95 million in the prior three months, the firm said on July 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While it&#8217;s just one measure of risk, $92 million is the
lowest it&#8217;s been since the third quarter of 2006,&#8221; Chief
Financial Officer David A. Viniar said in a conference call with
investors and analysts on July 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS), the sixth-biggest U.S. bank, said this week
its traders lost money on 15 days during the second quarter, up
from eight days a year earlier. Bank of America Corp., the No. 2
U.S. lender, reported last week that it had trading profits on
60 of the 63 days in the period. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;World Bank President Jim Yong Kim
appointed a Chinese partner at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to head
the poverty fighting institution&#8217;s private-sector arm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cai Jinyong, chief executive of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s China
securities venture, will become executive vice president and
chief executive officer of the Washington-based International
Finance Corporation effective Oct. 1, the World Bank said in an
e-mail statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cai, 53, becomes the first Chinese national to hold the
position, confirming the nation&#8217;s influence at the World Bank
two months after chief economist Justin Lin left. IFC, which
committed $15 billion last year, focuses on the private sector
of developing economies by making loans and taking equity stakes
in companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I am pleased that a world-class financial and development
professional like Jinyong has decided to bring his considerable
talent to the work&#8221; of IFC, Kim said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With his extensive knowledge of global financial markets
and investment climates, he&#8217;ll help IFC identify sound,
strategic private sector investments and public-private
partnerships that will help reduce poverty and create greater
prosperity for people in the developing world,&#8221; Kim said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cai started his career at the World Bank before joining
Morgan Stanley and then China International Capital Corp., now
the country&#8217;s biggest investment bank, at its inception,
according to the World Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He joined Goldman Sachs in 2000, was named a managing
director in 2001 and a partner in 2006. Prior to his
appointment, he headed Goldman Sachs Gao Hua Securities Co. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank by assets, was sued by Bank Hapoalim BM (POLI) over
$361.2 million in residential mortgage-backed securities in New
York state court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel&#8217;s second-biggest bank is seeking damages for claims
including common-law fraud, fraudulent inducement and negligent
misrepresentation, according to court filing today in Manhattan.
The bank accuses JPMorgan of making material misrepresentations
in the offering materials for the investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Plaintiff did not know the true facts regarding
defendants&#8217; misrepresentations and omissions in the offering
materials, and justifiably relied on those misrepresentations
and omissions,&#8221; Bank Hapoalim said in the filing. &#8220;Defendants&#8217;
wrongdoing has led directly to plaintiff&#8217;s damages, which
include loss of market value on the securities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank Hapoalim, based in Tel Aviv, sued Charlotte-based Bank
of America Corp., the second-biggest U.S. bank, in the same
court in April over $721 million worth of residential mortgage-
backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
biggest recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
and the crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the
market for the securities evaporated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bank Hapoalim BM v. JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
652799/2012, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department won&#8217;t be pursuing criminal charges against Goldman Sachs or its employees over its &#8220;big short&#8221; on the housing market several years ago. Fortunately, the details of Goldman''s appalling behavior and role in the financial crisis will live on forever in the public record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department&#8217;s investigation began last year after Senators Carl Levin of Michigan and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, a Democrat and a Republican, released the findings of a two-year inquiry by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations into Goldman&#8217;s sales and trading practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a press conference last year, Levin said he wanted prosecutors to examine whether Goldman violated the law by putting customers into disastrous mortgage bonds that it was shorting -- without telling the customers about its short positions. Levin also said prosecutors should review whether Goldman officials who testified before the panel committed perjury, including Goldman&#8217;s chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement yesterday, the Justice Department said prosecutors &#8220;determined that, based on the law and evidence as they exist at this time, there is not a viable basis to bring a criminal prosecution with respect to Goldman Sachs or its employees in regard to the allegations set forth in the report.&#8221; And that&#8217;s fine.&lt;/p&gt;

preliminary court approval of a $100 million settlement with
credit-card holders who sued the bank over claims it increased
required minimum payments after promising a fixed interest rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Maxine Chesney in San Francisco granted

yesterday. A final hearing is scheduled for Nov. 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accord resolves a class action, or group lawsuit, filed

cardholders paid on their credit card loans, lawyers for

&lt;p&gt;SAP AG (SAP), chasing Oracle (ORCL) Corp. and
International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) in the $26.7 billion
database market, is betting on new product features to gain
ground, said the man who helped build the company&#8217;s arsenal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest maker of business-management software has a
realistic chance of overtaking IBM in database revenue in the
next three years as it wins customers with new applications,
integration with mobile and real-time technology, and lower
prices, said John Chen, head of Sybase, the database and mobile-
software maker that SAP bought for $5.8 billion in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAP&#8217;s push into database software opens up a battlefield
with archrival Oracle and is giving the Walldorf, Germany-based
company a fresh source of revenue growth. To become a longer-
term threat to its bigger rivals, SAP also needs to plan for
advances further out, such as self-correction mechanisms or
built-in security layers, Chen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I used to run an underdog for a long time, and I never
underestimate competitors,&#8221; Chen said in a phone interview on
Aug. 7. &#8220;We seem to have something that could mesh well
together. But I would be stupid if I thought that three years
from now the same story holds, without any additions, without
some new features or architecture that we could put in.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is being
investigated by at least 11 state, federal and international
enforcement bodies as the bank struggles to contain damage from
a botched derivatives trade that cost it at least $5.8 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authorities in Singapore, Germany and Japan have joined the
list of agencies probing the largest U.S. bank&#8217;s trading errors,
the company said in a regulatory filing yesterday. The U.S.
Justice Department, Congress, Securities and Exchange Commission
and U.K. Financial Services Authority are among those examining
the bank, which could still lose as much as $1.7 billion more on
its credit derivatives portfolio, the company said. The bungled
trade may also make it more difficult to resolve other pending
reviews, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The firm expects heightened scrutiny by its regulators of
its compliance with new and existing regulations,&#8221; the company
said. Regulators will more frequently bring &#8220;formal enforcement
actions for violations of law rather than resolving those
violations through informal supervisory processes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank reiterated it found &#8220;material weakness&#8221; within
its internal controls and financial reporting related to the
trade and, as a result, its initial first-quarter results
couldn&#8217;t be relied on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight civil lawsuits have already been filed since the bank
initially disclosed problems in its synthetic credit derivatives
book on May 10, the bank said. The Justice Department and SEC
are also among agencies investigating the bank&#8217;s possible role
in an international bid-rigging scheme to manipulate the London
interbank offered rate, or Libor, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Online Investors May Gain Protections From U.S. Muni Regulator &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. financial regulators, responding to the growth in
trading securities over the Internet, want to bolster
protections for investors buying municipal bonds through online
brokers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, which drafts
regulations for the $3.7 trillion state-and-local bond market,
said yesterday said it may place new requirements on online
brokers, such as collecting information about investors, sending
out educational material and drawing up procedures for meeting
their obligations -- including those aimed at preventing
overcharging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The municipal market is dominated by individuals seeking
tax breaks or safety of bonds sold by state and local
governments, which rarely default. Other bonds also backed by
specific revenue, including parking garage tickets or levies on
new housing developments, pose more risks to investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board said the new rules would help individual
investors trading online understand the features and risks of
municipal securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;State Street Urges Futures Client Account Change After MF Global &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. futures regulators seeking to bolster protection of
customer funds after the collapse of MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ) and
Peregrine Financial Group Inc. should allow clients to put
collateral in separate accounts at custody banks, according to
representatives of State Street Corp. (STT) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission should revoke
a policy enacted in 2005 that banned futures customers from
using the accounts, State Street, the third largest custody
bank, said in a presentation prepared for a discussion in
Washington on possible new regulations. The agency should allow
for so-called tri-party custody accounts between clients,
brokers and custody banks, according to the presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allowing such accounts &#8220;would help protect customer margin
monies from misuse or fraud by the futures broker, without
impacting the clearinghouses&#8217; access to necessary funds,&#8221;
Charley Cooper, senior managing director of State Street Global
Markets, said in a statement yesterday before the discussion. In
tri-party accounts, futures brokers substitute their own
collateral to fully fund the clearinghouse while client money
remains at the custody bank. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SMBC Nikko Ordered to Improve Compliance After Banker Charged &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316)&#8217;s investment banking
unit was ordered to improve operations by Japan&#8217;s financial
regulator after a former banker was indicted for securities
violations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Services Agency told SMBC Nikko Securities
Inc. to report on how it will bolster compliance by Aug. 17, the
regulator said in a statement in Tokyo today. The firm lacked
controls to monitor the executive&#8217;s actions during the time he
allegedly breached securities laws, according to the FSA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The order is the second for Tokyo-based SMBC Nikko in four
months after it was told to beef up internal controls in April
following tips staff gave to clients on a public stock offering.
Japanese authorities are cracking down on insider trading after
leaks at brokerages including Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) eroded
confidence in the nation&#8217;s capital markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former SMBC Nikko executive Hiroyoshi Yoshioka and another
individual were charged with violating the financial instruments
and exchange law on July 15, said a Yokohama district court
official, asking to speak anonymously in accordance with the
court&#8217;s policy. Japan&#8217;s banking watchdog earlier recommended
they be indicted for conspiring to buy shares of a company with
insider knowledge that it was a takeover target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SMBC Nikko said this week it will cut President Eiji
Watanabe&#8217;s salary by 30 percent for four months in the wake of
the latest probe. The company will increase employees&#8217; liability
for breaching compliance rules and boost monitoring of
communication between staff and clients, SMBC Nikko said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We apologize for causing significant trouble to clients
and stakeholders,&#8221; the firm said in a statement today. &#8220;We
will carry out the improvement measures announced.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Standard Chartered Fitness Key Shutdown Grounds in N.Y. Law &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York&#8217;s financial-services regulator has grounds to shut
Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) in the state even if he accepts the
firm&#8217;s argument that it illegally laundered only a fraction of
the $250 billion he claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the state&#8217;s top banking regulator, Benjamin Lawsky has
power to act in his discretion against any financial institution
he deems untrustworthy, according to the charter of his year-old
department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penalties he could impose include fines and the revocation
of the bank&#8217;s license to operate in the state. Lawsky is said to
be considering a settlement figure as high as $700 million,
according to person familiar with the case. That would match the
amount HSBC Holdings Plc set aside last month to resolve
allegations of similar behavior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the Aug. 6 issuance of an order from Lawsky&#8217;s
Department of Financial Services threatened to revoke Standard
Chartered&#8217;s license, the bank has focused its defense on the
amount it laundered, saying it involved less than 1 percent of
the 60,000 Iranian wire transfers asserted by Lawsky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if Standard Chartered&#8217;s position is legally sound, the
order&#8217;s disclosure of internal e-mails suggesting a conspiracy
to hide the identity of Iranian clients from regulators has
given Lawsky grounds to act when the two sides face off at an
administrative hearing Aug. 15, according to experts on both
sides of the Atlantic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Google Agrees to Pay $22.5 Million for Apple Browser Breach &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) agreed to pay a record $22.5 million to settle
allegations by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission that it
breached Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s Safari Internet browser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fine, the largest ever the FTC has levied against a
company, represents the first by the agency for a violation of
Internet privacy as the agency steps up enforcement of
consumers&#8217; online rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FTC alleged that Mountain View, California-based Google
deceived consumers and violated terms of a consent decree signed
with the commission last year when it planted so-called cookies
on Safari, bypassing Apple software&#8217;s privacy settings, to track
users&#8217; Internet browsing behavior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google has drawn regulatory scrutiny and pressure from
consumer advocates for the way it handles personal information.
The operator of the world&#8217;s largest search engine signed a
consent decree with the FTC last year to settle allegations that
it used deceptive tactics and violated its own privacy policies
in introducing the Buzz social-networking service in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nagai Vows to Put Insider Scandal Behind Nomura in Newspaper Ads &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nomura Holdings Inc. Chief Executive Officer Koji Nagai
pledged in newspaper advertisements to avoid a repeat of the
leaks that led Japan&#8217;s biggest brokerage to lose underwriting
deals and cost his predecessor his job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nomura will make efforts to prevent a recurrence and to
strengthen internal controls further by carrying out improvement
measures thoroughly,&#8221; Nagai said in the advertisement published
in nine major Japanese newspapers this morning. &#8220;We will seek
to restore confidence by working together.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nagai took office on Aug. 1 after Kenichi Watanabe resigned
to take responsibility for failing to prevent employees from
giving tips to traders on share sales the firm managed in 2010.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and JPMorgan Chase  Co. were among 12
securities firms operating in Japan that this week pledged to
improve how they guard client information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We take this matter seriously and the entire firm is
working to regain the trust of the public,&#8221; said Keiko Sugai, a
spokeswoman for Tokyo-based Nomura. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nomura submitted a report to the Financial Services Agency
yesterday showing its progress on improving compliance, two days
before the deadline. The regulator penalized domestic brokerage
unit Nomura Securities Co. on Aug. 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goldman Says SEC Closed Probe of Firm After Threatening Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said U.S. regulators ended an
investigation of its role in selling $1.3 billion of mortgage-
backed securities and won&#8217;t sue the firm, reversing course after
investigators warned in February that they intended to recommend
legal action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Securities and Exchange Commission lawyers told Goldman
Sachs on Aug. 6 that they no longer planned to pursue claims
against the bank, the New York-based company said yesterday in a
regulatory filing. The regulator had sent Goldman Sachs a so-
called Wells notice in February, which typically gives
recipients a chance to dissuade investigators from recommending
the agency authorize enforcement action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC&#8217;s investigation looked at disclosures during the
late-2006 offering of subprime residential mortgage-backed
securities underwritten by Goldman Sachs, according to the
firm&#8217;s filing. It didn&#8217;t elaborate on the SEC&#8217;s decisions. David
Wells, a spokesman for the firm, declined to comment on the
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;EADS Unit Probed by U.K. Prosecutors Over Saudi Bribery Claims &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A European Aeronautic, Defence  Space Co. (EAD) unit in Britain
is being probed by U.K. prosecutors over allegations it paid
bribes to win a telecommunications deal with Saudi Arabia&#8217;s
royal family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation involves suspected payments to Saudi
officials from EADS&#8217;s GPT Special Project Management unit, David
Jones, a spokesman for the U.K.&#8217;s Serious Fraud Office in
London, said yesterday in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contract was valued at 2 billion pounds ($3.13
billion), the Telegraph newspaper reported in May 2011, citing
statements to investigators by a former GPT employee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Certain allegations have been made and these are being
properly addressed with our full and constructive engagement,&#8221;
an EADS spokesman, who declined to be cited by name, said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Leoni, Wire Harness Makers Probed by EU Over Antitrust Cartels &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leoni AG and other makers of automotive wire harnesses are
being probed by the European Union for possible collusion in
multiple cartels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wiring unit of German wire and cable-maker Leoni is
cooperating with the European Commission, the company said
yesterday. The antitrust investigation, announced by the
regulator, is part of a crackdown on price fixing in the auto-
parts industry. The commission didn&#8217;t name the companies it is
probing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leoni will cooperate with the EU probe and provide
information and documents to clarify the issue, Bernd Buhmann, a
spokesman for the Nuremberg-based company, said in a telephone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have not made any provisions for a possible fine,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;There were several inspections at our premises since
February 2010 and we do not know if they will continue or
intensify or are already completed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cargill Must Pay Former Singapore Trader&#8217;s Bonus, Judges Say &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cargill Inc., the biggest agricultural company in the U.S.,
must pay a former Singapore-based trader $1.74 million in
deferred bonuses, the appeals court in the Asian city ruled in a
49-page decision received yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mano Vikrant Singh, who left Cargill in 2008, sued the
company claiming his bonus was wrongly forfeited. Singh, who was
paid a monthly salary of S$25,000 ($20,054), had a bonus of $3.2
million for the 2008 financial year, according to the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cargill, which forbade some staff that left from continuing
a career within the financial or commodity-trading industries
for two years, sought to stifle competition with its
restrictions, Singh had said in his complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cargill, based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, had demanded that
Singh return confidential information he took from the firm, and
said he breached his contract by setting up Xangbo Global
Markets Pte. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said in a statement today it will abide by the
decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philip Jeyaretnam, Singh&#8217;s lawyer, said the judgment
established that the restraint of trade doctrine doesn&#8217;t only
apply to outright prohibition of post-employment competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is: Singapore High Court and Mano Vikrant Singh v
Cargill TSF Asia Pte. OS103/2011. Singapore Court of Appeal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Brian Womack" date="Aug 13, 2012  5:07 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-13/facebook-plunge-limits-goldman-sachs-gain-as-lockup-ends-tech.html"><headline>Facebook&#8217;s Drop Limits Goldman Sachs Gain as Lockup Ends</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc. (FB)&#8217;s stock plunge has
robbed Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) of much of
the potential gain they could unlock as soon as this week, when
a ban on sales of insiders&#8217; shares begins to lift. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the end of the lockup has the potential to put
additional pressure on the stock price, owners such as Goldman
Sachs (GS), which now has a stake worth about $900 million, face a
dilemma: whether to sell now and realize a smaller profit or sit
tight and risk further losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not as if they have to sell all their holdings the
moment the market opens,&#8221; said Brian Wieser, an analyst at
Pivotal Research Group, who rates the stock a buy. &#8220;They want
to be rational about this.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, over the coming nine months, about 1.91 billion
shares will be freed up, compared with fewer than 500 million
now available for trading. That flood of shares is a deterrent
for some potential buyers, said Herman Leung, an analyst at
Susquehanna International Group, said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s one of the No. 1 issues on investors&#8217; minds right
now,&#8221; Leung said. &#8220;Even the investors that I talk to who want
to buy the stock and like the company are not sure if they can
stomach the lockups.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors including Goldman Sachs, Microsoft and Accel
Partners, which together control more than 200 million shares in
the owner of the largest social network, can begin selling them
on Aug. 16 for the first time since the May 17 initial public
offering, according to a regulatory filing. It&#8217;s the first in a
wave of lockup expirations in the coming months that will
quadruple the number of shares that can be traded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Google&#8217;s IPO &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, will probably hang
onto its stake after the lockup-ban lifts, a person with
knowledge of the matter said on Aug. 10. Microsoft views
Facebook as a strategic partner in the combat against Google
Inc. (GOOG), rather than as a near-term moneymaker, said the person,
who requested anonymity because the plans are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook, worth $52.2 billion, has lost more than $40
billion in market value since the IPO, making it the worst
performer among all large IPOs on record, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of the Menlo Park, California-based company fell
less than 1 percent to $21.60 at the close in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashley Zandy, a spokeswoman for Facebook, declined to
comment, as did Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook&#8217;s post-IPO plight contrasts with the experience of
Google Inc., which held its IPO in August 2004. Google, the most
valuable U.S. Internet company, rose by more than 70 percent
within two months and more than doubled by the end of that year.
While shares declined on the days following expirations in
November and December of that year, on the day the biggest
lockup ended, Feb. 14, 2005, shares rose 3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lockups End &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook will have several lockup expirations. The first,
on Aug. 16, is for stockholders other than Chief Executive
Officer Mark Zuckerberg who sold some of their shares in the
IPO. Then other shareholders, including employees, will be able
to sell at later dates. A final round comes in May 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the concerns voiced by Leung are confirmed in
research that has looked at how stocks perform when shares are
unlocked, said Anant Sundaram, a professor at Tuck School of
Business at Dartmouth. That&#8217;s especially true of venture-capital
backed companies, which often have the steepest declines when
lockup periods wind down, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook shares have declined 43 percent since the IPO, and
the stock has failed to close higher than the IPO price of $38
since its first day of trading. The company had initially
proposed a trading range of $28 to $35 before the number of
shares in the IPO was boosted, as well as the price itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Already Declined &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock has been weighed down by concerns over growth,
which were amplified by the company&#8217;s inaugural earnings report
as a public company. Second-quarter sales grew 32 percent, down
from 45 percent in the previous three months, figures released
last month showed. The shares have lost 20 percent since the
July 26 report. Revenue is forecast to rise 29 percent in 2013
and 28 percent in 2014, according to the average estimate of
analysts compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock&#8217;s drop has been large enough to give investors
second thoughts about selling now, Sundaram said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Will there be a significant downward move?,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Probably not, would be my guess, given that stock has already
fallen quite a bit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Little Incentive &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prices at which shares held by employees, insiders and
other investors can vary widely, meaning some would profit from
by selling shares even now. Microsoft acquired its stake --
currently worth $566.5 million -- in 2007 at a $15 billion
valuation, while venture-capital firm Accel Partners invested in
2005, when Facebook had a value of about $100 million. Its stake
is now worth about $2.93 billion. The Goldman Sachs investment
valued Facebook at $50 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pivotal&#8217;s Wieser estimates about 55 percent of the 268.1
million shares that are liberated by Aug. 16 could be sold as
some investors seek to secure gains. The remaining 1.66 billion
shares are released at later dates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the stock were up at $80, I think you&#8217;d see much more
activity,&#8221; said Lise Buyer, principal at Class V Group in
Portola Valley, California. &#8220;The stock is so far below where
the IPO was.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other large early investors include Mail.ru Group Ltd., a
Russian Internet company, and Digital Sky Technologies, a
Russian investment company. Individuals with large stakes
include Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and Mark Pincus,
chief executive officer of Zynga Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Venture Capitalists &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lockups end, shares at some venture capital firms may
automatically be distributed to the firms&#8217; own investors, and
that could create more selling, said Jay Ritter, a professor of
finance at the University of Florida. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firsthand Technology Value Fund Inc.&#8217;s lockup expires
toward the end of this year, said Chief Executive Officer Kevin Landis. The fund bought shares from October 2011 to March 2012
at an average cost of $31.50 -- about 46 percent higher than the
current price. Landis said that while it&#8217;s difficult to predict
what he&#8217;ll do, he plans to exercise restraint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We would try to be a little bit more disciplined about
it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If the company&#8217;s doing well, and the company&#8217;s
putting up good numbers, and they&#8217;re making progress against
their plan, there&#8217;s something to be said for just waiting for
the dust to settle.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Matt Townsend and Dakin Campbell" date="Aug 13, 2012  4:10 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-13/durbin-sees-visa-accord-thwarting-push-to-cap-card-fees.html"><headline>Durbin Sees Visa Accord Thwarting Push to Cap Card Fees</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Senator Richard Durbin&#8217;s office
told retailers that their efforts to have Congress rein in
credit-card swipe fees will be imperiled if they support a $6.6
billion settlement with Visa (V) Inc. and MasterCard Inc. (MA) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is going to foreclose the prospect of good
legislation for the foreseeable future,&#8221; Dan Swanson, senior
judiciary counsel for the Illinois Democrat, said in a
conference call with the Food Marketing Institute. &#8220;It will
essentially be game over.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durbin, the majority whip, won the inclusion of limits on
debit-card swipe fees, or interchange, in the 2010 Dodd-Frank
Act. That trimmed annual revenue for the biggest U.S. banks by
about $8 billion and benefited retailers including Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. (WMT) and Target Corp. (TGT) Credit-card swipe fees are higher
and generate about $40 billion a year for lenders such as
JPMorgan Chase  Co., Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Citigroup Inc. (C) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max Gleischman, a Durbin spokesman, confirmed that Swanson
discussed the settlement with the Food Marketing Institute and
National Retail Federation. He declined to say whether Durbin,
the Senate&#8217;s No. 2 Democrat, will push for more legislation or
if merchants&#8217; approval of the accord would damage such efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retailers should &#8220;think hard&#8221; before taking the deal,
Durbin said Aug. 2, according to the Congressional Record. He
called it a &#8220;stunning giveaway&#8221; to Visa and Purchase, New
York-based MasterCard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa dropped 0.6 percent to $128.32 in New York, and
MasterCard declined 0.1 percent to $425.63. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Antitrust Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Food Marketing Institute, a trade group whose members
include Target, Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD) and Bentonville, Arkansas-
based Wal-Mart, doesn&#8217;t have a position on the settlement, said
Heather Garlich, a spokeswoman for the Arlington, Virginia-based
organization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa, MasterCard and banks agreed last month to resolve the
seven-year-old antitrust case. In addition to cash payments, the
deal includes a temporary reduction in credit-card swipe fees
and allows retailers to impose surcharges on such transactions.
The accord requires the approval of U.S. District Judge John Gleeson in Brooklyn, New York, may be nullified if enough
merchants refuse to join the proposed class action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Complex Dispute&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In our view, if this settlement is finalized, or even if
it&#8217;s preliminarily approved, merchants had better be sure this
is going to fix the interchange problem,&#8221; Swanson said in the
conference call last month with the Food Marketing Institute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, his boss said it wouldn&#8217;t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The settlement does nothing to change the anticompetitive
fee-fixing that Visa and MasterCard do on behalf of their member
banks,&#8221; Durbin said. &#8220;In fact, it gives Visa and MasterCard
broad and permanent legal immunity to continue doing exactly
that in the future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Electronic Payments Coalition, which represents banks,
MasterCard and San Francisco-based Visa, has said that Congress
shouldn&#8217;t interfere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The legal system was and is the appropriate system to
resolve a large and complex dispute between companies, not
Washington,&#8221; Trish Wexler, a spokeswoman for the trade group,
said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retailers, even if they reject the settlement, still may
struggle to push more interchange regulation through Congress,
which approved the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul when
Democrats controlled both chambers. Durbin abandoned efforts to
cap credit-card fees after failing to persuade enough colleagues
to support them, and Republicans, most of whom opposed the debit
caps, now control the U.S. House. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Checking Accounts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The payments industry escaped earlier attempts to regulate
interchange on credit cards, which average about 2 percent of
each transaction, saying the fees are needed to compensate banks
for the risk of lending money. That argument isn&#8217;t relevant to
debit cards, which tap funds held in consumer checking accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Retail Federation, which criticized the
settlement, hasn&#8217;t advised members to oppose it, said Mallory Duncan, the trade group&#8217;s general counsel. Members of the NRF,
which describes itself as the world&#8217;s largest retail trade
group, include Macy&#8217;s Inc. (M) and Gap Inc. (GPS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Senator Durbin doesn&#8217;t have to gin up opposition to this
settlement,&#8221; Duncan said in an interview. An &#8220;overwhelming
majority&#8221; of NRF members already don&#8217;t support it, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart urged all merchants to reject the agreement,
saying it would limit their right to take legal action against
Visa and MasterCard, the world&#8217;s biggest bank-card networks, and
constrain payments-industry innovation. Target, based in
Minneapolis, said the accord would &#8220;perpetuate a broken
system,&#8221; according to a July 20 statement on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Washington Game&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Community Pharmacists Association, National
Association of Convenience Stores and National Grocers
Association, all named plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said they
oppose the settlement. Their position doesn&#8217;t stem from concerns
that support would diminish chances that Congress will act, said
Jeffrey Shinder, a lawyer for the three groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The suggestion that this is just some kind of Washington
game cannot withstand any scrutiny when you look at what&#8217;s going
on out there,&#8221; Shinder said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Larkin, chief executive officer of the National
Grocers Association, said on July 27 that his group plans to
push for more legislation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Further Reforms&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to predict what Congress will do and won&#8217;t
do,&#8221; Larkin said in an interview. &#8220;It would be our intention
to continue to talk to Congress because we think we need to
achieve further reforms.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed settlement must be submitted to Gleeson by
Oct. 19. If he gives preliminary approval, notice of the deal
will be sent to members of the class, which includes about 7
million U.S. retailers who accepted Visa or MasterCard credit
cards since 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durbin&#8217;s comments and the decision by some retailers to
reject the settlement isn&#8217;t surprising and doesn&#8217;t mean the
accord won&#8217;t be approved, said Glenn Fodor, a Morgan Stanley
analyst. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With 7 million merchants and with this structured the way
it was, you can&#8217;t keep everyone happy,&#8221; Fodor said in a phone
interview. &#8220;This was well within the realm of expectations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant
Discount Antitrust Litigation, 05-md-01720, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, took another step forward with a plan to spin off its
animal health unit, registering the initial public offering with
U.S. regulators &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has said it plans to sell as much as 20 percent of
the new company, to be called Zoetis Inc., to raise cash. The
New York-based drugmaker may enable current investors to swap a
portion of their Pfizer shares for stock in the new company.
Pfizer also could hold the stock for sale later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulatory filing today moves to complete the final
announced piece of Chief Executive Officer Ian Read&#8217;s effort to
shrink Pfizer by selling and spinning off non-drug units, which
included the April sale of its infant nutrition unit for $11.9
billion to Vevey, Switzerland-based Nestle SA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer fell less than 1 percent to $23.72 at the close of
New York trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The animal health unit generated $4.23 billion last year
from products used in livestock and pets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Bank of America Corp. and Morgan
Stanley (MS) are acting as underwriters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juan Ramon Alaix will continue as Zoetis&#8217;s CEO, and Richard Passov will carry on as Chief Financial Officer. Frank D&#8217;Amelio,
Pfizer&#8217;s CFO, will be the chairman of the board of the new
company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) raised $2.5
billion with five-year debt at its lowest fixed rate for that
maturity as the extra yield investors demand to own bank bonds
instead of government securities narrows to the least in a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. lender by assets issued the 2 percent,
senior unsecured bonds due August 2017 to yield 135 basis points
more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The bank&#8217;s $5 billion of 6 percent senior
unsecured notes maturing in January 2018 traded at 119.1 cents
on the dollar to yield 2.23 percent with a 154 basis-point spread 
on Aug. 10, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan sold the new securities as relative yields on
corporate bank debt fall to 233 basis points as of Aug. 10, the
narrowest since August 2011, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data. Credit-default swaps linked to the New
York-based lender that&#8217;s struggled to stem losses on soured
hedges made by its chief investment office have dropped to 119.5
basis points today from a 2012 high of 171 in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have been constructive on this credit through the
course of dealing with the CIO trading losses, and we continue
to view this firm as the premier domestic bank,&#8221; Don Jones, an
analyst at Sterne Agee  Leach Inc., wrote today in a research
note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Swap Spread &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan swaps were trading 91 basis points below the
average cost of default insurance for banks including Bank of
America Corp., Wells Fargo  Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. on Aug. 10, according to data
provider CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spread was 103 basis points April 4, before Bloomberg
News reported the bank had amassed a position in the Markit CDX
North America Investment Grade Index Series 9 that may have been
as much as $100 billion. JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said July 13 that the botched trades may saddle the bank
with a $7.5 billion loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new bonds may be rated A2 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service,
its sixth-highest grade, according to a person familiar with
offering who asked not to be identified citing lack of
authorization to speak publicly about the sale. Moody&#8217;s
downgraded JPMorgan two levels to A2 in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan managed the sale of the new debt, which has the
lowest coupon among the firm&#8217;s fixed-rate, five-year bond issues
bigger than $100 million, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leon Cooperman&#8217;s Omega Advisors
Inc., which has earned an average of 13.3 percent annually since
it was founded in 1991, reduced stakes in JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
and Citigroup Inc. (C) in the second quarter while exiting its
holding in Bank of America Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Omega sold 1.43 million shares of JPMorgan during the
three-month period that ended June 30, according to a filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission today. The New York-
based hedge fund sold 1.31 million shares of Citigroup, while
exiting its 6.5 million share investment in Bank of America and
opening positions in Express Scripts Holding Co. and Watson
Pharmaceuticals Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooperman exited positions in Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC),
VeriSign Inc. and Seagate Technology PLC. Omega also sold its
entire stake in SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-traded
product backed by gold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Omega, which invests its $6 billion in assets mainly in
U.S. stocks, has returned an average of 13.3 percent annually
since Cooperman founded it in 1991, compared with 11.4 percent
for other equity-oriented funds, according to Chicago-based
Hedge Fund Research Inc., Bloomberg Markets magazine reported in
its August issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hedge fund was among those boosting stakes in JPMorgan
in the first quarter before the shares plunged because of a $2
billion trading loss. Omega bought 1.34 million shares of the
New York-based bank, raising its stake to 2.22 million,
according to a May 14 filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the first quarter, Omega had also reduced stakes in
Sunoco Inc. (SUN), the Philadelphia-based refiner, and Regal
Entertainment Group. The money manager had bought Wellpoint
Inc., the second-biggest U.S. health plan, and Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the
three-month period that ended March 31. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider, opened a
research lab in Nairobi, its first in Africa, as part of an
expansion to gain customers in the continent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, based in Armonk, New York, said today in a statement
that it&#8217;s setting up the unit to work with the Kenyan government
on developing local solutions for water shortages and traffic
congestion. The move also adds to its on-the-ground expertise to
help sell products and services to companies and governments
across the continent, Uyi Stewart, a researcher for IBM in New
York, who worked on the deal, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It gives us that innovative arm to leapfrog everybody
else when doing business in the country,&#8221; Stewart said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty, who is in Nairobi to
meet with President Mwai Kibaki and other government officials
today, is betting that growth markets like Russia, Brazil and
Indonesia can contribute toward 30 percent of revenue by 2015,
up from 22 percent last year. In Africa, IBM is present in more
than 20 countries, compared with four, two years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is big demand for increasing the level of
sophistication of all levels of life in the African countries,&#8221;
said Takreem El-Tohamy, IBM&#8217;s general manager for the Middle
East, Africa and Pakistan, in an interview. &#8220;There is big
development and big focus driven by political stability,
economic stability and a big social drive from rural areas to
cities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Develop Skills &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nairobi research unit is IBM&#8217;s 12th worldwide and is an
extension of its plan to train workers in Africa in an effort to
aid economic development on the continent and increase the
company&#8217;s customer base. IBM also has agreements to develop
skills in African nations including Ghana and Tanzania. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM didn&#8217;t disclose its investment in the Nairobi lab or
give projections for revenue from it. Its other research labs
are in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, China, India, Ireland,
Israel, Japan and Switzerland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s expansion in Africa is part of a drive to add
$20 billion in revenue by 2015. That goal includes winning
contracts to make cities and infrastructure more efficient
through data analysis and cloud computing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein won dismissal of a suit in
which investors said the bank knew mortgage-backed securities 
it sponsored didn&#8217;t comply with underwriting standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge William Pauley in New York said in a
ruling today that plaintiffs&#8217; allegations were &#8220;conclusory&#8221;
and lacked specifics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs in the so-called consolidated derivative
suit include Michael Brautigam and the Retirement Relief System
of the City of Birmingham, Alabama. Those also named as
defendants included current and former Goldman Sachs executives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs said Goldman Sachs breached its fiduciary
duty when it accepted Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP,
funds then failed to comply with conditions for accepting it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs sponsored $162 billion worth of residential
mortgage-backed securities, knowing that the loans underlying
the securities were troubled, the plaintiffs claimed. The bank
then sold $1.1 billion worth of the securities to Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac, knowing the underlying loans were troubled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was also accused of knowing the securities
didn&#8217;t comply with underwriting standards because the banking
and securities firm had conducted due diligence on the loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs fell 35 cents to $103.26 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re. Goldman Sachs Mortgage Servicing
Shareholder Derivative Litigation, 1:11-cv-04544, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) will allow
customers to house excess swaps and futures collateral in a
separate bank account as it seeks to reassure investors after
losses at MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ) and Peregrine Financial Group
Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new service will allow clients to automatically
aggregate excess margin at JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., the firm&#8217;s
insured deposit-taking unit, Emily Portney, head of agency
clearing, collateral and execution at the New York-based bank,
said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s certainly in response to client queries and more
emphasis on safekeeping of client money,&#8221; Portney said. &#8220;The
key is safety, operational efficiency and more choice for
clients&#8221; in how their funds are protected and invested, Portney
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures brokerage customers at MF Global are still missing
$1.6 billion in segregated funds after the firm filed for
bankruptcy in October after bets on European sovereign debt,
credit ratings downgrades and the worst quarterly loss in the
company&#8217;s history unnerved investors. About $220 million in
segregated client money is unaccounted for at Peregrine after
founder and Chief Executive Officer Russell Wasendorf Sr. was
arrested July 13 after a suicide attempt and a signed confession
that he defrauded customers for 20 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Under Attack &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s decision shows how the brokerage model is under
attack, said Craig Pirrong, a finance professor at the
University of Houston. Benchmark interest rates near zero since
2008 had already put earnings pressure on the firms, also known
as futures commission merchants, or FCMs, and the missing money
at MF Global and Peregrine has jarred investors who thought
their assets were protected by segregation requirements under
the Commodity Exchange Act, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s another illustration of the impending end of the FCM
model,&#8221; Pirrong said. Futures brokerages earn money on customer
collateral by lending it out at higher rates than they pay to
the investor or by buying securities with it. &#8220;Everything is
tilting against that old model,&#8221; Pirrong said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At MF Global and Peregrine, the excess customer money held
at the brokerages is what disappeared. Collateral backing trades
of MF Global customers that was held by CME Group Inc. (CME), as well
as Peregrine customer assets maintained by Jefferies Group Inc.,
were protected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Margin Calls &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors who trade futures or clear swaps often leave
extra collateral in their accounts to have it available if
needed for a margin call. This money exceeds what the
clearinghouse and the brokerage demand to keep the trades
active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan service will draw unneeded money and
securities from however many clearing brokers an investor uses,
Portney said. &#8220;It&#8217;s clearing-broker agnostic,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008
prompted many derivatives users to spread their clearing
business among several banks or broker-dealers to lessen the
risk of having to move all their accounts at once or open a new
one in a time of stress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan rose 0.9 percent to $37.33 as of 12:53 p.m. in New
York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new collateral treatment will also allow investors to
choose how to invest their excess margin because it&#8217;s held in a
depository bank account that the client will control, Portney
said. That&#8217;s different than in the current futures model, where
investment decisions are made by the brokerage and not the
investor, Pirrong said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CME Plan &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Banks are looking for services to sell to people, and
this can be one of them,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CME Group, the world&#8217;s largest futures market, said last
month it&#8217;s considering a plan to hold all customer funds at
clearinghouses or other depositories in response to MF Global
and Peregrine. The exchange operator and clearinghouse owner
said any interest earned by the customer money would be returned
to the futures brokerages to maintain a key feature of how the
firms earn revenue, according to a letter to customers from
Executive Chairman Terrence Duffy and Chief Executive Officer
Phupinder Gill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duffy, testifying before Congress after the idea was
announced, said it &#8220;will be controversial and perhaps have
disruptive consequences.&#8221; He later said the proposal wasn&#8217;t
meant to disrupt how the futures industry works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has combined clearing services across securities,
swaps and futures along with collateral management solutions and
agency execution under one unit. Previously, several different
parts of the bank had responsibility for the various asset
classes and products, Portney said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move is meant to help customers on both the buy side
and sell side deal with new requirements introduced by the Dodd-
Frank Act in the U.S. and similar regulations being developed in
Europe, she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nigeria&#8217;s oil spill agency said it
wants Chevron Corp. (CVX), the world&#8217;s fourth-largest energy company,
to pay a $3 billion penalty for a rig explosion that caused a
46-day fire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Having looked at the relevant literature and what happens
in other countries, we recommended a fine of $3 billion for
Chevron,&#8221; National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency&#8217;s
Director-General Peter Idabor said in an interview in Abuja, the
capital, yesterday. For now, the planned penalty is only a
suggestion and &#8220;still not conclusive&#8221; as it requires the
approval of lawmakers and President Goodluck Jonathan&#8217;s
government, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron was drilling a gas-exploration well at Funiwa,
about six miles (9.6 kilometers) off Nigeria&#8217;s delta coast, when
it exploded Jan. 16, killing two workers. The fire that followed
stopped on March 2 after the flow of natural gas dried up, the
company said in a statement. The accident was caused by
equipment failure, the oil spill agency known as NOSDRA, said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron &#8220;respects and complies with the laws in the
countries in which it operates,&#8221; Kurt Glaubitz, a San Ramon,
California-based company spokesman, said today in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Worst Spill &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOSDRA is also investigating a seven-week gas leak that
started on March 20 at the Obite field operated by Total SA (FP)&#8217;s
Nigerian unit to determine appropriate penalty, Idabor said. The
agency had suggested to the government in July that Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA) pay a $5 billion fine for an oil leak in December from
its offshore Bonga field that caused the country&#8217;s worst spill
in more than a decade. Shell said less than 40,000 barrels
leaked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;NOSDRA&#8217;s actions indicate willingness to act in defense
of the environment,&#8221; said Nnimmo Bassey, executive director of
Environmental Rights Action, an affiliate of Friends of the
Earth. &#8220;The companies must be held accountable for their
actions; pollution must be punished and polluters must pay.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell, Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Chevron, Total SA and Eni SpA (ENI)
operate joint ventures with state-owned Nigerian National
Petroleum Corp. that pump more than 90 percent of the crude
output of Africa&#8217;s top oil producer. Shell is the biggest
operator in the West African country by number of oil fields,
followed by Exxon Mobil and Chevron. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Emergency Response &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil today said an oil spill from an unknown source
was sighted along the coast near Ibeno, in the southern Akwa
Ibom state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;An emergency response team was immediately dispatched to
the shoreline and samples of the substance collected for
fingerprinting to determine its source,&#8221; Nigel Cookey-Gam, a
Lagos-based spokesman, said today in an e-mailed statement.
Exxon Mobil operates a facility in the area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until Shell&#8217;s Bonga spill, the worst on record in Nigeria
happened in January 1998, when a pipeline linking Exxon Mobil&#8217;s

&lt;p&gt;The lawn was filled with Goldman
Sachs (GS) Group Inc. partners dressed in pink looking out on a pink
sunset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rows of Moet  Chandon Champagne bottles stood chilled. On
the buffet were dishes from Toy Restaurant in Manhattan and
Tutto Il Giorno in nearby Sag Harbor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plum TV LLC -- brought back into business by LXTV founders
Morgan Hertzan and Joseph Varet -- was filming. DJ Cassidy,
founder of DJs for Obama, was spinning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&#8217;t the first time hedge-fund manager Richard Perry
and his designer wife, Lisa, opened their home in North Haven
for a cause. Still, their first paddle-board race and party to
benefit Breast Cancer Research Foundation already looked like
one of the most fun benefits on the East End. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m a little surprised that this got traction,&#8221; said
Lisa Perry standing next to her pool in vintage Pucci. &#8220;We
thought maybe we&#8217;d raise $200,000 and we&#8217;re close to $550,000. I
think it&#8217;s a combination of people being curious about North
Haven -- they want to see the property -- and it&#8217;s BCRF and
Maria Baum.&#8221; In the end the party raised more than $615,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baum, a former trader, had the idea for the event over
dinner with the Perrys a year ago. Richard Perry had introduced
her to paddle-boarding last summer. Baum wound up going out on
the water almost every day as she went through chemotherapy for
breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bays&#8217; Beauty &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;d be really angry, and then I&#8217;d get absorbed in the
beauty of the bays,&#8221; Baum said. &#8220;I would come back so peaceful
and so energized that most people didn&#8217;t realize what I was
going through.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maria and Larry Baum and the Perrys became the event co-
chairmen. Maria Baum tapped her contacts in finance, including
Goldman Sachs partners Heather Shemilt, Rebecca Shaghalian,
Stacy Bash-Polley and Michele Docharty, who designated Goldman
Sachs Gives as a lead sponsor and member of the host committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This backing early in the planning process helped set the
ambitious scope of the event, said Myra Biblowit, president of
the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knight Capital Group Inc. (KCG) and Southfield Capital Advisors
LLC also supported the event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the party, Estee Lauder (EL) Inc. Chairman William Lauder
chatted with Harvard Business School professor Robert Kaplan,
while designers Donna Karan and Reed Krakoff caught up near the
Champagne bar. Darcy Miller, editorial director of Martha
Stewart Weddings, talked with Clifford Hudis of Memorial Sloan-
Kettering Cancer Center, who is the chairman of the BCRF
Scientific Advisory Board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paddle-board race had 60 competitors, many of them new
to the sport. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;I Fell&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary Scheerer, president of Sag Harbor Industries Inc.,
finished first in one of the races. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There was a lot of wind coming across the bay,&#8221; Scheerer
said. &#8220;I fell 10 feet from the finish line, but my closest
competitor fell more.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Perrys&#8217; home, which they call &#8220;The Beach House,&#8221;
wasn&#8217;t open, though one could steal a peek at the brightly
colored modern art inside. The grounds offered a Calder
sculpture, a Robert Indiana &#8220;Love&#8221; mosaic, large red and
yellow rings by Zhu Jinshi and a pink paddle board propped
against the poolside cabana, where the Perrys&#8217; daughter,
Samantha, was seen talking with friends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ranch Hand &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Navigator Group Inc. president Charles Stevenson&#8217;s son
Ryland Stevenson is back in the Hamptons after working as a
ranch hand, he said at a party he attended with his stepmom,
writer Alex Kuczynski. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Days at Middle Fork Lodge in Challis, Idaho, started at 6
a.m. and included lugging around hoses and sprinklers and
bailing hay. &#8220;I listened to lively things to keep me going,&#8221;
the University of San Francisco sophomore said, &#8220;Stevie Ray
Vaughn, boogie music, Johnny Lang.&#8221; As for the future: &#8220;I&#8217;d
like to be a sports lawyer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the guest of honor at the party, Gigi Levangie
Grazer, had just sat down with a psychic, who was on hand to
help Grazer celebrate her new novel, &#8220;The After Wife,&#8221; about a
44-year-old Santa Monica, California, widow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The book is going to be a complete success and I&#8217;m going
to have five more children,&#8221; said Grazer, who&#8217;s divorced from
film producer Brian Grazer; they had two boys, 8 and 12. &#8220;And
five more marriages, one for each child.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She added: &#8220;Every book will be made into a movie starring
Brad Pitt, George Clooney or Robert Pattison.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher Burch, CEO of J. Christopher Capital, hosted
the party at his Southampton home, less than a mile from the C.
Wonder store in the village. Burch&#8217;s firm created the chain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cocaine is proving a more resilient
commodity than chocolate in Colombia, the largest supplier of
the narcotic to the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices of cocoa beans, used to make chocolate, have dropped
40 percent this year in Colombia, South America&#8217;s third-largest
supplier, as the cost of leaves processed into cocaine holds
steady, according to data compiled by police and growers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chocolate ingredient&#8217;s slump in the past year, as
concern about Ivory Coast supply disruptions subsides and
European demand weakens, is threatening a more than decade-long
campaign in Colombia to eradicate drug production that funds
guerrilla movements. It&#8217;s also jeopardizing growers&#8217; plans to
become South America&#8217;s largest cocoa producer after Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you make an effort to invest in cocoa and then get
unprofitable prices, and someone else shows up and pays cash for
the other stuff, the farmer migrates to what&#8217;s easier,&#8221; said
Ciro Alfonso Ramirez, who heads a northern Colombian regional
office of the National Cocoa Growers Federation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of hectares planted with coca leaves rose 3.2
percent in 2011, faster than the area sowed with cocoa, based on
federation and United Nations data. While the government
eradication campaign saw cocaine production slip 1.4 percent to
345 metric tons last year, cocoa output tumbled 9.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moore Capital Management LLC, the
hedge fund that had boosted its JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) investment
earlier this year, joined other firms in selling the bank&#8217;s
shares following a multibillion-dollar trading loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moore, the $15 billion New York-based firm run by Louis Moore Bacon, sold its full JPMorgan holding of about 6.47
million shares in the second quarter, according to a filing
yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. TPG-Axon
Management LP, the $4 billion fund run by Dinakar Singh, sold
its stake of 3.13 million shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan stakes held by hedge funds, mutual funds and other
asset managers with at least $100 million in U.S listed equities
shrank by $28.7 billion to $89.8 billion in the second quarter,
the biggest position decrease among all U.S. equities in the
quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Firms sold a
net 65.5 million shares in the period after the New York-based
bank disclosed a trading loss that has grown to at least $5.8
billion and its stock slumped 22 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hedge-fund sales are &#8220;a reflection of the fact that at
least for the near term, it&#8217;s dead money,&#8221; said Nancy Bush, an
analyst and contributing editor at SNL Financial LC, a research
firm based in Charlottesville, Virginia. &#8220;We&#8217;re only a couple
months into this process so we have at least several more months
of this playing out. You just don&#8217;t know what the collateral
damage is going to be.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s non-operating Quigley
Co. unit won permission to have creditors vote on a bankruptcy
plan that would bar most asbestos claims against the two
companies, as a judge said the issue of whether Pfizer bought
votes will be addressed later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart Bernstein in Manhattan today
approved Quigley&#8217;s sixth reorganization plan draft after
objections that it won&#8217;t resolve whether Pfizer devised the plan
in bad faith and manipulated the bankruptcy for its benefit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An issue that keeps resurfacing -- whether Pfizer&#8217;s actions
are &#8220;just another attempt to buy the vote&#8221; of asbestos
claimants -- will be addressed at a trial when Quigley seeks
final confirmation of its plan after a vote, Bernstein said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His ruling may lead to an end to the seven-year Chapter 11
case over how the former maker of products for the steel
industry and its parent, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, will
resolve their liability for asbestos claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the draft plan, Pfizer would contribute assets to a
trust to cover claims that Quigley&#8217;s past products caused
asbestos-related injuries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asbestos claims against Quigley may total $4.45 billion
over 42 years, according to testimony cited by Bernstein in
September 2010, when he denied Quigley&#8217;s request to exit
bankruptcy under a prior plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, the court found Pfizer&#8217;s proposed contribution
of $216.2 million wasn&#8217;t enough to pay asbestos claimants, who
may have fared better by suing the company under civil tort law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s Contributions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has since increased its contributions, and in March
2011 a committee formed by asbestos claimants settled with
Pfizer and will receive $800 million under the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Trustee, an arm of the Justice Department that
oversees bankruptcies, objected to the current disclosure
statement, which describes how creditors would be treated.
Concerns raised by Bernstein in his September 2010 ruling still
haven&#8217;t been resolved, Tracy Hope Davis, the acting trustee,
said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that ruling, Bernstein found Pfizer &#8220;wrongly
manipulated the voting process to assure confirmation of the
plan, and thereby gain the benefit of the channeling
injunction&#8221; by giving some asbestos claimants incentives to
vote in favor of the plan, Davis said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the bankruptcy code, channeling injunctions allow
companies to limit future liabilities by channeling them to a
trust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Victims&#8217; Accords &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current plan still doesn&#8217;t disclose whether settlements
Pfizer made with asbestos victims are consistent with historic
standards, and why asbestos claimants who settled their lawsuits
against Pfizer before Quigley&#8217;s bankruptcy have a right to vote,
Davis said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would only give some asbestos claimants 7.5 percent of
what they seek and block them from making future claims against
Pfizer under tort law, where they might get an estimated
23 percent of what they seek, Davis added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quigley, in bankruptcy since 2004, filed the sixth version
of its plan June 29. It addresses an April appeals court ruling
on how Pfizer can use Quigley&#8217;s bankruptcy to protect itself
from asbestos claims. The court found that law firm of Peter
Angelos can sue Pfizer based on manufacturer liability under
Pennsylvania law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new plan&#8217;s exception for claims under state law would
be null and void if the appeals court&#8217;s decision was modified on
rehearing or by the Supreme Court, Quigley said in the plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Litigation&#8217;s Start &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angelos began suing Pfizer in 1999, saying that because the
drug company&#8217;s logo appeared on Quigley products, it should have
liability for the asbestos-containing products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaud, Morgan  Quinn LLP, a law firm that represents
asbestos claimants, objected, saying Pfizer is paying
$300 million more to the 40,000 claimants represented by the
committee than it paid 193,000 earlier, to &#8220;settle the claims
of the most outspoken opponents&#8221; of its reorganization plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hissey Kientz LLP, a law firm which said it represents
3,200 claimants with diseases such as mesothelioma and lung
cancer, joined in Reaud Morgan&#8217;s objection. A committee of
unsecured creditors and Pfizer said they supported the current
disclosure statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Albert Togut, a representative for people who haven&#8217;t yet
manifested asbestos-related illnesses but will do so in the
future and bring claims against the trust, said in court papers
that he was still resolving issues with Quigley and Pfizer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spokesman&#8217;s Statement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said the company is
&#8220;pleased with the court&#8217;s decision to approve Quigley&#8217;s
disclosure statement&#8221; and looks forward to moving ahead with
the bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quigley, founded in 1916, made three products for the steel
industry from the 1940s to the 1970s that contained asbestos.
Pfizer bought Quigley in 1968. The unit stopped most operations
in 1992 and filed for bankruptcy in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has said it never made or sold any Quigley products.
Some claimants haven&#8217;t released Pfizer from alleged derivative
liability, according to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the sixth amended plan, Pfizer will contribute
$260 million in cash to a trust that will pay most future
asbestos claims brought against it and Quigley. Pfizer will also
forgive a secured claim of $95 million against Quigley, a loan
of $19 million to Quigley, and an unsecured claim of
$33 million. It will contribute insurance benefits that cover
asbestos personal injury claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Property&#8217;s Use &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer will also contribute a property leased to an Orange
County, California, Anheuser-Busch distributor to pay asbestos
claims. The property has an estimated value of $43.6 million and
produced cash flow of $1.9 million in the first 12 months since
Pfizer acquired it, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The committee of asbestos claimants asked in 2010 to have
the bankruptcy dismissed so it could bring tort claims, which
are otherwise blocked by bankruptcy law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Trustee also in 2010 asked the bankruptcy court to
end Quigley&#8217;s Chapter 11 case, citing the fact that creditors
alleging asbestos-related health issues have been unable to sue
New York-based Pfizer during the case, and many have died. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Quigley Co., 04-15739, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The appeals
case is 11-2635, 11-2767, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is considering
adding Nigerian domestic bonds to its government bond emerging
market index series on Oct. 1, according to a note from the bank
obtained by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inclusion would be phased over three months, according
to the note that was sent to clients. The GBI-EM Index series
may include government debt maturing in 2014, 2019 and 2022 as
they are the country&#8217;s most liquid bonds, according to the note.
Sarah Stipicevic, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan in New York,
declined to comment when contacted by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Market conditions may change from now until the primary
inclusion date,&#8221; the note said. &#8220;In which case, this list may
be subject to change.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigeria, Africa&#8217;s biggest oil producer, has been seeking
inclusion into emerging-market indexes to increase portfolio
flows into the nation&#8217;s capital markets. Securities and Exchange
Commission Director General Arunma Oteh said in an interview in
October that she was planning to discuss the inclusion with
index providers such as JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on Nigeria&#8217;s 16.39 percent notes due 2022 dropped 36
basis points today, or 0.36 percentage points, to 16 percent,
according to prices on the Financial Markets Dealers Association
website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigeria&#8217;s total domestic debt rose 18 percent to $39
billion at the end of June from a year earlier, according to the
Debt Management Office in the capital Abuja. Finance Minister
Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said on Aug. 8 that the government wants to
reduce domestic borrowing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The naira has risen 3.2 percent to 157.2 a dollar this
year, making it Africa&#8217;s second best performing currency in
2012. The nation&#8217;s benchmark Bonny Light crude blend has
advanced 27 percent from a 2012 low in June. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the Wall
Street bank that generated 58 percent of first-half revenue from
sales and trading, eliminated 20 to 30 jobs in that division
this week, according to a person briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cuts affected salespeople and traders in the U.S., with
most taking place in New York, said the person, who asked not to
be identified because the reductions aren&#8217;t being announced
publicly. The decision is part of a continuous review of
staffing levels amid difficult markets, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, said
last month that it plans to eliminate $500 million from annual
expenses, mostly from compensation, after reporting its lowest
first-half revenue since 2005. The cuts are on top of a $1.4
billion expense-reduction program that was completed earlier
this year. Goldman Sachs employed 32,300 people at the end of
June, according to a company press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re controlling the levers that we can, which are
expenses and capital,&#8221; Chief Financial Officer David A. Viniar,
57, said on a July 17 conference call with analysts. &#8220;We
obviously don&#8217;t want to go too far on either one because we
think that the world will get better.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stronger U.S. economic data have
reduced the probability that the Federal Reserve will announce a
third round of so-called quantitative easing when policy makers
gather next month, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We do not expect a move to QE3&#8221; at the Sept. 12-13
Federal Open Market Committee meeting, Jan Hatzius, chief
economist at Goldman Sachs in New York, wrote yesterday in a
note to clients, citing retail sales that rose more than
forecast in July. Economic growth probably accelerated, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While QE3 at the September 12-13 FOMC meeting remains
possible, our best estimate is that it will take until late
2012/early 2013 before Fed officials return to balance sheet
expansion,&#8221; Hatzius wrote. &#8220;The U.S. economic recovery remains
sluggish, but we believe that it will pick up a bit in coming
months.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional asset purchases by the central bank are less
likely next month as strengthening retail sales and slowing
inventory accumulation by businesses signal that &#8220;U.S. economic
data continue to look a bit stronger,&#8221; Hatzius wrote. Economic
growth in the third quarter probably accelerated to 2.3 percent
from an earlier tracking estimate of 2.2 percent, the economist
said, citing Goldman Sachs estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Although Fed officials clearly adopted a strong easing
bias at the July 31-Aug. 1 FOMC meeting, we do not think that
this amounts to a pre-commitment to QE3,&#8221; Hatzius wrote.
&#8220;Instead, we believe that continued weakness is necessary to
prompt a substantial easing move. And so far, that weakness is
not showing up in the data.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Retail, Inventories &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retail sales increased 0.8 percent in July, the biggest
gain since February and first gain in four months, the Commerce
Department said Aug. 14. A separate report the same day showed
that inventories at U.S. companies rose in June at the slowest
pace in nine months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a very solid case for additional accommodation
under the Fed&#8217;s dual mandate of maximum employment and 2 percent
inflation,&#8221; Hatzius wrote in the report published yesterday
after U.S. markets closed. &#8220;We do believe that Fed officials
will ultimately decide to ease policy further.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

Spanish wind farm from Element Power US LLC to help offset lower
returns on bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insurer&#8217;s Aviva Investors business and SachsenFonds
bought the Almatret wind farm in Lerida, Catalonia, for an
undisclosed sum, according to an e-mailed statement. The park
started production in 2010 using 25 turbines made by Denmark&#8217;s
Vestas Wind Systems A/S. (VWS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurers and pension funds are seeking alternative assets
after a decline in interest rates reduced yields on bonds and
equity-market volatility increased. Wind farms, promoted by
European nations with climate goals and supported by subsidy
programs, operate for about 25 years, offering steady gains for
institutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In a challenging macro economic environment where yields
remain low, especially on government bonds, institutional
investors are looking for diversified sources of stable
income,&#8221; Ian Berry, fund manager for infrastructure and
renewable energy at Aviva Investors, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Element Power, a Portland-based developer backed by Hudson
Clean Energy Partners, has more than 7,650 megawatts of
operating and development-stage wind and solar assets globally. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, will add an over-the-counter version of AstraZeneca (AZN)
Plc&#8217;s heartburn pill to its stable of consumer products that
include the pain reliever Advil and the vitamin Centrum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has been looking to expand its consumer business,
which generated $3.01 billion last year. The New York-based
company last year discussed trying to get regulators to approve
a nonprescription form of Lipitor, its top-selling cholesterol
pill that lost patent protection in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca is trying to plot its strategy after the April
resignation of Chief Executive Officer David Brennan, who had
been criticized by investors for failing to bolster the London-
based company&#8217;s pipeline of experimental drugs. Pfizer has been
selling off its non-drug units and focusing on developing new
medicines. While it&#8217;s shedding its infant nutrition and animal
health businesses, Pfizer opted to keep its consumer business
that includes over-the-counter treatments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To obtain the rights to an over-the-counter Nexium, Pfizer
paid AstraZeneca $250 million upfront with royalties from sales
once the pill enters the market in 2014, the companies said
yesterday in a joint statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said the cost of the deal reduces its 2012 profit
forecast 2 cents a share, to a range of $2.12 to $2.22.
AstraZeneca boosted its annual earnings forecast 15 cents a
share, to $6 to $6.30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the deal, &#8220;Pfizer is continuing to enhance the value
of our consumer health-care business,&#8221; Ian Read, Pfizer&#8217;s
chairman and chief executive officer, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nexium deal may be the first of several such
partnerships, Pfizer and AstraZeneca said. Both are &#8220;exploring
the potential for a strategic partnership that could include
similar agreements for other AstraZeneca prescription brands for
which OTC versions might be appropriate,&#8221; the companies said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nexium was AstraZeneca&#8217;s third-biggest drug in 2011, with
$4.4 billion in revenue, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Nexium loses patent protection in the U.S. in 2014.
The agreement doesn&#8217;t change the sales rights for the
prescription version of the drug, which will stay with
AstraZeneca. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The over-the-counter version of the pill still has to be
approved by regulators, the companies said in their statement.
It could go on sale in the U.S. as soon as 2014, and other
markets afterwards. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Green Mountain Trademarks Rivo Name for Espresso Machine &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. (GMCR), which plans to
introduce an espresso maker this year to compete with Starbucks
Corp. (SBUX), registered &#8220;Rivo&#8221; as a trademark for a machine to make
such drinks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name Rivo, which means &#8220;stream&#8221; in Italian, was
registered by Green Mountain&#8217;s Keurig Inc. unit this year for
electric brewing and electric espresso machines, according to
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office website. Waterbury,
Vermont-based Green Mountain previously said it is working with
Luigi Lavazza SpA to develop an espresso maker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve not made a product announcement related to that
name,&#8221; Suzanne DuLong, a Green Mountain spokeswoman, said in an
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green Mountain is facing more competition as grocers and
other manufacturers, such as Safeway Inc. (SWY) and Rogers Family Co.,
make private-label capsules to fit into Keurig machines. While
the main patents for K-Cups expire in September, Chief Executive
Officer Lawrence Blanford has recently started selling the more-
expensive Vue machine and single-serve cups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rivo is another step to help Green Mountain combat
emerging rivals as it struggles to accurately forecast capsule
sales. Green Mountain&#8217;s espresso machine will likely compete
with Starbucks&#8217;s Verismo single-serve beverage maker, which will
be sold in the U.S. this year online, in some Starbucks cafes
and in specialty retailers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz announced in March that the
Verismo would specialize in high-pressure, espresso drinks and
would also make brewed coffee. The Seattle-based company hasn&#8217;t
released pricing information for the Verismo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lavazza, based in Italy, owned 5 percent of Green Mountain
as of February 24, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dick&#8217;s Sporting Goods Buys Some Rights to Field  Stream Marks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dick&#8217;s Sporting Goods Inc. (DKS), the largest U.S. retailer of
athletic goods, said it will buy the rights to Field  Stream
magazine&#8217;s trademark in a number of categories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magazine, which was founded in 1895, focuses on outdoor
activities related to hunting and fishing.  According to a
statement from Coraopolis, Pennsylvania-based Dick&#8217;s, the rights
that were bought are for use of the mark in the hunting,
fishing, camping and paddle categories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously the company had leased these rights from the
magazine since 2007. Now Dick&#8217;s is paying $25 million to own
them, according to the Dick&#8217;s statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bulgari Accuses Kenneth Jay Lane of Copying Jewelry Designs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulgari SpA sued Kenneth Jay Lane Inc., saying the New York
jewelry designer copies and imitates its rings and bracelets
without permission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rome-based Bulgari accused Kenneth Jay Lane, in a complaint
filed Aug. 13 in federal court in Manhattan, of copyright
infringement, design patent infringement and unfair competition.
The company, a unit of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC),
seeks a court order to end the sale of allegedly infringing
jewelry and unspecified damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Bulgari&#8217;s jewelry items consist of distinctive and
original designs, including design elements and features that
have become synonymous with Bulgari in the eyes of the public,
consumers and the luxury goods industry,&#8221; the Italian company
said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Wolfert, a lawyer who represents Kenneth Jay Lane
in a separate trademark infringement case, didn&#8217;t return an e-
mail or telephone call to his office seeking comment on the
Bulgari lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bulgari v. Kenneth Jay Lane, 12-cv-6194, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Google Can Appeal Class-Action Status of Digital-Book Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) can appeal the class-action status granted to a
lawsuit over digital books, a federal appeals court in New York
said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Circuit Judge Denny Chin in New York, sitting as a
federal trial judge in the case, in May granted class-action or
group status to a series of plaintiffs, including the Author&#8217;s
Guild and the American Society of Media Photographers in
lawsuits over electronic books. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chin also granted a request for three individual plaintiffs
to represent a nationwide class of copyright holders in the
Author&#8217;s Guild suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court yesterday granted Google leave to appeal
the class-action ruling while the case is still pending before
Chin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, Google asked Chin to dismiss the Authors Guild
case, arguing that authors benefit from the project because
their books can be more readily found, bought and read, while
the public gains &#8220;increased knowledge.&#8221; Google also argued
that the display of snippets of text is fair use under copyright
law and that the authors haven&#8217;t been harmed by the display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his May ruling, Chin also rejected Google&#8217;s arguments
that the groups lacked standing to sue over claims the search
engine company&#8217;s digital scanning of millions of books infringed
the copyright owners&#8217; rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maggie Shiels, a spokeswoman for Google, declined to
comment on the court&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suits stem from Google&#8217;s plan, announced in 2004, to
digitally scan books from public and university libraries to
provide short excerpts of text to people who use its Internet
search engine. The Authors Guild, individual authors and
publishing companies sued in 2005, claiming the Mountain View,
California-based company hadn&#8217;t sought authorization from the
owners of the works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google has argued that the display of snippets of text is
fair use under copyright law. Chin asked Google today why it was
important at this stage of the case to determine the ownership
of the copyrights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google said in a February court filing that it has scanned
more than 20 million books, and that Web users can see excerpts
in English from more than 4 million of them. The project began
with the digitizing of books from the libraries of the
University of Michigan, Harvard University, Stanford University,
Oxford University and the New York Public Library. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors&#8217; case is Authors Guild v. Google, 05-08136;
the visual artists&#8217; case is American Society of Media
Photographers v. Google, 10-02977; U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Duke, Progress Ordered to Disclose Transactions Details &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) and Progress Energy Inc. (PREX), were ordered to
disclose some details of transactions with major customers they
had argued was a trade secret, Capitol Broadcasting Corp.
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The North Carolina Utilities Commission told the two
companies yesterday that the details they insisted should be
protected didn&#8217;t involve technical information and had no
independent commercial value, according to Capitol Broadcasting
Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aug. 24 is the deadline for the companies either to file an
appeal or release the public records, Capitol Broadcasting
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public inquiry that lead to the utility commission&#8217;s
ruling came in the wake of Duke&#8217;s acquisition of Progress,
according to Capitol Broadcasting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Barclays
Plc (BARC) are among seven banks subpoenaed in New York and
Connecticut&#8217;s investigation into alleged manipulation of Libor,
according to a person familiar with the matter and company
filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subpoenas were sent in recent weeks to Deutsche Bank AG (DBK),
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) in
addition to JPMorgan and Barclays, the person said yesterday.
Citigroup Inc. (C) and UBS AG (UBSN) received subpoenas earlier this year
as part of the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and Connecticut
Attorney General George Jepsen are jointly investigating alleged
manipulation of the London interbank offered rate by lenders.
RBS, UBS, Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) and Deutsche Bank are among
the lenders that regulators in Europe, Asia and the U.S. are
investigating. The U.S. is conducting a criminal investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confidence in Libor, a benchmark for financial products
valued at $360 trillion worldwide, has been dented by Barclays&#8217;
admission that it submitted false London and euro interbank
offered rates. Robert Diamond resigned as Barclays&#8217; chief
executive office after the bank was fined 290 million pounds
($456 million). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;False Submissions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derivatives traders requested the false submissions in the
Libor and Euribor setting process, as they were &#8220;motivated by
profit and sought to benefit Barclays&#8217; trading positions,&#8221; the
U.K. Financial Services Authority said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation by Schneiderman and Jepsen could broaden
to include additional banks, said the person. Jennifer Givner, a
spokeswoman for Schneiderman, and Jaclyn Falkowski, a
spokeswoman for Jepsen, declined to comment on the subpoenas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi&#8217;s office is
&#8220;actively reviewing the Libor matter&#8221; and has subpoenaed 14
banks, spokeswoman Jenn Meale said. In addition to the seven
institutions in the New York and Connecticut probe, Florida
subpoenaed Bank of America Corp., Societe Generale SA (GLE), Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN), Credit Agricole SA (ACA), Royal Bank of Canada,
Rabobank Groep and Lloyds Banking Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah Binnie, a spokeswoman for Edinburgh-based RBS, said
the bank continues to receive requests from various regulators
investigating the setting of Libor and other interest rates. The
lender is cooperating with the investigations and &#8220;keeping
relevant regulators informed,&#8221; she said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is not possible to estimate with any certainty what
effect these investigations and any related developments may
have on the group,&#8221; Binnie said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Information Requests &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kathryn Hanes, a spokeswoman for Frankfurt-based Deutsche
Bank, said the lender has received subpoenas and requests for
information from some regulators and governmental entities in
the U.S. in connection with setting interbank rates and is
cooperating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Citigroup said in a regulatory filing that
subsidiaries &#8220;have received additional requests for information
and documents from various U.S. and non-U.S. governmental
agencies, including the offices of the New York and Connecticut
attorneys general.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS, based in Zurich, said in a regulatory filing that
numerous agencies, including &#8220;various state attorneys general&#8221;
are investigating whether there were improper attempts to
manipulate Libor and other rates. A second person familiar with
the matter said the bank received a subpoena from New York in
February. Both declined to comment because the matter is
private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Regulatory Demands &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole Sharp, a spokeswoman for London-based Lloyds Banking
Group, said the company is assisting various regulators in their
investigations. Royal Bank of Canada (RY) spokeswoman Katherine Gay
said the bank is also cooperating with regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We did not find any evidence of collusion with other
banks, and we have determined that our Libor submissions
reflected our perception of our cost of funds,&#8221; Gay said in an
e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London-based HSBC said in a 2012 interim report that it is
&#8220;the subject of regulatory demands for information&#8221; and is
cooperating with the investigations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives of the other institutions couldn&#8217;t be
reached for comment or declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley&#8217;s office said
in July it was also conducting a Libor investigation and was
working with other state agencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libor is derived from a survey of banks conducted each day
on behalf of the British Bankers&#8217; Association in London. Lenders
are asked how much it would cost them to borrow from one another
for 15 different periods, from overnight to one year, in
currencies including dollars, euros, yen and Swiss francs. After
a set number of quotes are excluded, those remaining are
averaged and published for each currency by the BBA before noon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American International Group Inc. (AIG),
the bailed-out insurer, rebuffed a request from New York
Comptroller John Liu to release workforce-diversity data that
was made public by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and MetLife Inc. (MET) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG hasn&#8217;t joined other companies among the city&#8217;s largest
financial firms in providing access to information on female and
minority employment, Michael Garland, Liu&#8217;s executive director
for corporate governance, said in an interview yesterday.
Goldman Sachs and MetLife, the biggest U.S. life insurer, agreed
in April to publicly release employment information that is
required to be prepared for the federal government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We try to get to a place where the company recognizes it
is in their self interest and the interest of shareholders to
take the next step, and that&#8217;s why companies agree,&#8221; Garland
said. &#8220;AIG apparently is not there yet.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insurer &#8220;has engaged in discussions with the
comptroller&#8217;s office,&#8221; said Jim Ankner, a company spokesman.
&#8220;AIG is very committed to diversity.&#8221; Matt Anderson, a
spokesman for AIG&#8217;s majority owner, the U.S. Treasury
Department, didn&#8217;t respond to messages seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liu oversees funds for New York City pensions and had more
than $120 billion under management as of March 31. He said
investors are entitled to know about the diversity of companies
in which they invest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Many companies say they recognize the business case for a
more diverse workforce and highlight their efforts to promote
greater diversity,&#8221; Liu said in an e-mailed statement today.
&#8220;But without disclosure of employment data, shareholders cannot
be assured companies are practicing what they preach. This is a
proposal we will continue to pursue.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan, Citigroup &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, said
20 percent of its executives and senior officials in the country
were female, compared with 17 percent at MetLife. The figure was
24 percent at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and 21 percent at Citigroup
Inc., both of which have made the data available for years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, Citigroup and MetLife all reported that a
majority of their U.S. workforce was female, led by JPMorgan,
the country&#8217;s largest bank by assets, at 57 percent. The figure
is 36 percent at Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said 54 percent of first- and mid-level officials
and managers were female and 64 percent of a category labeled
&#8220;all other.&#8221; At Citigroup, almost half of the 49,650 female
employees work in administrative support, and about 15 percent
are first- or mid-level managers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disclosure &#8220;gives us a picture, you know, to the
extent that they have a diverse workforce, how does that play
out as you go up the ladder,&#8221; Garland said. &#8220;We know as an
industry, there&#8217;s significant underrepresentation&#8221; of
minorities and women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York City pension funds held more than 1.2 million
Goldman Sachs shares, 2.3 million MetLife shares, and 1.1
million AIG shares, according to an April 16 statement from Liu. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lester R. Brafman, a managing
director in the high-yield debt sales and trading department at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), left this week after 11 years at the
firm, according to five people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brafman, 50, joined New York-based Goldman Sachs in 2001
after six years at Credit Suisse First Boston Inc., according to
records maintained by the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. He previously worked at Wasserstein Perella
Securities Inc. and Lehman Brothers Inc., the records show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brafman ran high-yield debt trading at Credit Suisse and
had a similar role after joining Goldman Sachs. He&#8217;s been a
Goldman Sachs managing director, the second-highest rank at the
firm, after partner, since 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which generated 58 percent of first-half
revenue from sales and trading, eliminated 20 to 30 jobs in that
division this week, a person familiar with the matter said
yesterday. The firm last month reported its lowest first-half
revenue since 2005 and said it would cut $500 million from
costs, on top of $1.4 billion in savings already achieved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of high-yield debt in the U.S. have already set a
record for August as companies tap into an unprecedented $44.9
billion of cash that has poured into funds that buy junk bonds
in 2012. Yields that are near record lows and a slowdown in
earnings growth have sparked concern that the market for the
debt has peaked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman at Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment on Brafman&#8217;s departure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp., plagued by complaints about customer service in its mortgage unit, said it hasn&#8217;t yet refinanced a &#8220;significant number&#8221; of loans as part of the industry&#8217;s $25 billion settlement of foreclosure abuses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lender blamed the &#8220;time required to underwrite&#8221; loans for why it hasn&#8217;t completed many of its planned $1 billion in modifications, according to a filing earlier this month. By contrast, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) said last week it has already finished a &#8220;significant portion&#8221; of its $500 million program and Wells Fargo (WFC)  Co. said it expected to complete its $900 million requirement two years ahead of the 2015 deadline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The infrastructure Bank of America has to handle an issue of this magnitude isn&#8217;t great, so they&#8217;re last out of the gate,&#8221; said Nancy Bush, an analyst and contributing editor at SNL Financial, a research firm in Charlottesville, Virginia. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo have better mortgage systems, she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Delays mean distressed Bank of America borrowers may miss out on record low interest rates that could ease their burden. The lender, overwhelmed in February by demand under an earlier federal refinancing program, could also forego incentives for early completions and face penalties if it doesn&#8217;t help most borrowers within two years under the U.S. settlement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The firm doesn&#8217;t expect to pay any fines because it&#8217;s &#8220;on a path&#8221; to meeting homeowner assistance pledges within a year, Jumana Bauwens, a Bank of America spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based company started to contact refinancing customers in May and will continue through year-end, she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Settlement Terms &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bank of America and other lenders are compelled to offer the modifications under a February accord with the Department of Justice and 49 state attorneys general after probes into shoddy mortgage servicing. Allegations included the use of &#8220;robo-signers&#8221; to speed home seizures by submitting foreclosure claims without checking their accuracy. Bank of America pledged almost half of the fines and assistance in the $25 billion deal. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Banks get credit toward reaching the targets set by the settlement when they assist homeowners by reducing interest payments and debt. Loans modified within the first year of the program are worth 25 percent more in credits, giving lenders motivation to act quickly. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Interest rates may be trimmed by an average of 2 percentage points for as many 25,000 borrowers, Bank of America said in an Aug. 2 filing. Only customers who owe more than their houses are worth and are current on payments are eligible. The moves are meant to earn $1 billion in credits under the accord. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cutting Debt &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another $7.6 billion of assistance involves principal reductions and actions such as cash incentives to sell a borrower&#8217;s home for less than the amount owed, known as a short sale. Bank of America said it will offer an average $150,000 reduction to more than 200,000 overdue customers by this month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Response to that program has also trailed other firms in the settlement. Homeowners exhausted from fighting foreclosure may be skeptical of the offers, Ron Sturzenegger, head of Bank of America&#8217;s Legacy Assets Servicing unit, said in June. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Unfortunately, many customers may just be tired of the process and thinking about giving up,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Housing advocates have said that the low response is because borrowers have already struggled with lost paperwork and unresponsive customer service. Bank of America, the second biggest U.S. lender by assets, had the lowest rating of any big bank in a December survey by Ann Arbor, Michigan-based American Customer Satisfaction Index LLC. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bank of America is successfully reaching and assisting customers, said Dan Frahm, a spokesman for the lender. He declined to say if response rates had improved from June. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Demanding Results &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;People clearly want to see results as quickly as possible, particularly given there&#8217;s been a slight uptick in foreclosure rates,&#8221; said Mike Calhoun, president of the Center for Responsible Lending. &#8220;Most people think interest rates are at or near the bottom, that they can only go up.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bank, led by Chief Executive Officer Brian T. Moynihan, has committed about $43 billion to clean up defective mortgages and shoddy servicing since the start of 2007. Moynihan, 52, became CEO in 2010, telling staff when he was named that &#8220;our core businesses are the right ones, we just have to execute.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, run by CEO Jamie Dimon, 56, and the biggest U.S. lender by assets, has made &#8220;great progress&#8221; in reaching its required $500 million in refinancing assistance and expects to be done before year-end, said Amy Bonitatibus, a spokeswoman for the New York-based firm. Customers are saving an average of $300 per month, she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Beating Targets &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo, which replaced Bank of America as the biggest mortgage servicer and lender, expects to earn $900 million in refinancing credits by March 2013, according to Tom Goyda, a spokesman for the San Francisco-based company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Led by CEO John Stumpf, 58, the bank said Aug. 7 that a &#8220;higher-than-expected response&#8221; meant that it would likely go beyond the settlement&#8217;s minimum requirements and help as many as 40,000 borrowers, double the number it said three months earlier. Refinancing will continue beyond March for those extra clients, Goyda said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C), which also participated in the accord, set a target of $378 million in refinancing credits. The bank said it started the work in June and hasn&#8217;t disclosed its progress. The New York-based firm said it will cut customer&#8217;s interest rates to 5.25 percent, or about 1.7 percentage points higher than the current 30-year rate according to McLean, Virginia-based Freddie Mac. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;GMAC Mortgage, the bankrupt home-loan firm owned by Detroit-based Ally, hasn&#8217;t disclosed how many modifications it has done. The company has reached out to more than half of eligible borrowers and the response has been &#8220;positive,&#8221; said Susan Fitzpatrick, a spokeswoman for the business. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Facing Penalties &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The five firms face penalties of 125 percent to 140 percent of the shortfall in assistance targets for deadlines that come in two and three years. The banks must finish 75 percent of the program by the first deadline and get another 12 months to complete it, according to settlement documents. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Joseph A. Smith, North Carolina&#8217;s ex-commissioner of banks assigned to police the settlement, can help impose fines by working with state and federal officials. Lenders have sent Smith preliminary data on homeowner relief and servicing data, and his office will issue a report in several weeks, he said in an e-mailed statement today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bank of America has previously struggled to process applications after the U.S. Home Affordable Refinance Program was broadened so more people qualify. To cope, the lender used a reservation system asking some customers if they wanted to wait three months to attempt a refinance. Moynihan told analysts in April that the firm had cut back on mortgage capacity to focus on selling loans to existing customers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s some noise about a reservation system,&#8221; Moynihan said in the April 19 conference. &#8220;We underperformed, but we&#8217;re doing exactly what we wanted, which is to focus on direct-to-retail.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Sophia Pearson" date="Aug 17, 2012 11:32 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-17/amerigroup-board-goldman-sachs-sued-over-wellpoint-deal.html"><headline>Amerigroup Board, Goldman Sachs Sued Over WellPoint Deal</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Amerigroup Corp. (AGP) investors sued the
managed-care company&#8217;s board and Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. for
allegedly putting their own interests ahead of shareholders&#8217; and
ignoring other bids when they agreed to WellPoint Inc. (WLP)&#8217;s
$4.9 billion purchase offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was &#8220;hopelessly conflicted&#8221; as an adviser
on the transaction and pushed the board to ignore a more
lucrative deal with a suitor described as Company D, the funds
said in papers filed last night in Delaware Chancery Court and
made public today. The investment bank stood to gain $233.7
million if Amerigroup sold before Aug. 13 under a derivative
transaction, according to the filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;By recommending a quick deal with WellPoint as opposed to
Company D or any of the other interested suitors, Goldman kept
alive its chance of receiving a windfall profit,&#8221; the
plaintiffs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acquisition announced July 9 would make Indianapolis-
based WellPoint, the second-largest U.S. health insurer, the
largest private provider of Medicaid plans for low-income
patients. Amerigroup, based in Virginia Beach, Virginia, helps
states manage health coverage for the poor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit is a derivative action filed on behalf of
Amerigroup against its directors and some senior executives, as
well as New York-based Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disgorgement Sought &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs, the City of Monroe Employees Retirement
System and the Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement
System, are seeking a court order barring the deal and requiring
that Amerigroup&#8217;s management disgorge $12 million in WellPoint
restricted stock grants. They also asked the court to find
Goldman Sachs liable for aiding and abetting the board&#8217;s alleged
breaches of fiduciary duty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maureen C. McDonnell, an Amerigroup spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a phone call seeking comment on the lawsuit.
Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is City of Monroe Employees Retirement System v.
Capps, CA7788, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) raised 1.5
billion euros ($1.85 billion) from its first bond sale in the
currency for more than a year as investors seek to diversify
risk by purchasing non-euro region assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. bank priced the 10-year bonds to yield 100
basis points more than the mid-swaps rate, according to a person
familiar with the deal. The notes were initially marketed with a
110 basis-point spread. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based lender followed Wells Fargo  Co.
and Procter  Gamble Co. in tapping European investors seeking
haven assets. JPMorgan last sold 1 billion euros of 3.75 percent
bonds on June 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It offers a way to increase exposure to non-European
risk, like the recent Wells Fargo deal,&#8221; said Gregory Turnbull Schwartz, an Edinburgh-based fund manager at Kames Capital,
which manages about 50 billion pounds ($78.5 billion) of assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost to swap euros for dollars is near the lowest in
three months, according to the 10-year cross-currency basis
swap, making it attractive for issuers to sell bonds in the
common currency. The swap was 32 basis points below the euro
interbank offered rate, or Euribor, at 12:24 p.m. in London,
approaching the lowest since May 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan arranged the deal. Kate Haywood, a London-
based spokeswoman for the bank, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A shortage of injectable drugs in
the U.S. means India&#8217;s Strides Arcolab Ltd. (STR) could sell a
division that makes generic cancer treatments and antibiotics
for more than the entire company&#8217;s market value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strides, which has seen its market capitalization double to
48 billion rupees ($832 million) this year, may sell its Agila
Specialties unit, three people with knowledge of the matter said
last week. A multiple of 18 to 20 times earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization would represent a
&#8220;fair&#8221; price for Agila, Ernst  Young LLP said, meaning the
division could fetch at least $1.35 billion, according to data
and analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bangalore-based company is considering the sale as
large drugmakers seek acquisitions to offset a potential decline
in revenue this year of more than $21 billion due to U.S. patent
expirations in 2011 and 2012. The global market for so-called
generic steriles may swell to $17 billion by 2020, according to
Citigroup Inc., even as a crackdown on manufacturers by U.S.
regulators has added to a shortage of injectable drugs. Agila
may be attractive to large global drugmakers looking to expand
in injectable medicines, including Hospira Inc. (HSP), according to
Centrum Broking Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Agila is a very valuable asset today, more than at any
other time,&#8221; said V. KrishnaKumar, a Mumbai-based mergers and
acquisitions partner at Ernst  Young, who named Pfizer Inc. (PFE) as
a possible buyer of Agila. &#8220;Sterile injectable deals tend to be
expensive because the assets are specialized. Large
pharmaceutical companies looking to expand their generics
portfolios should be interested in Agila.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Profit Surge &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Strides rose 3 percent to a record 818.3 rupees. The
gain was the biggest in the 17-company BSE Healthcare Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company on Aug. 9 denied it was considering selling
Agila after Bloomberg News reported the plan. In a statement,
Strides said it would inform the stock exchange &#8220;as and when
there is any such development.&#8221; Chief Executive Officer Arun Kumar yesterday declined to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company hasn&#8217;t approached potential acquirers yet,
three people said last week, asking not to be identified as the
information is private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said in an e-mail that it doesn&#8217;t comment on
speculation. Dan Rosenberg, a spokesman for Hospira, said the
company doesn&#8217;t comment on market speculation, when asked
whether it was interested in acquiring Agila. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Started in 1990 by Kumar and K.R. Ravishankar, Strides
began manufacturing injectable drugs five years later and
entered the U.S. market for sterile products in 2004. The
business was renamed Agila in 2010 and reported Ebitda of 2.7
billion rupees last year, accounting for more than half of
Strides earnings, according to a company presentation in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;FDA Approval &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s total profit will more than quadruple to 10.2
billion rupees this year, according to the average of eight
analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Agila&#8217;s sales will
jump 47 percent in 2012 to 13.3 billion rupees as it benefits
from the shortage of injectable drugs in the U.S., Fortune
Equity Brokers Ltd. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This business is doing well, because manufacturing
capacity is in short supply,&#8221; said Ajit Kumar Jain, joint
managing director of Ipca Laboratories Ltd., the world&#8217;s biggest
maker of anti-malarial drugs, which is building its own
injectable-medicines plant. &#8220;Strides has good capacity and new
facilities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an antibiotics plant in Brazil was given U.S. Food
and Drug Administration clearance in February, and Agila
acquired another plant in southern India in April, the company
has seven facilities with FDA approval to make injectable drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Powerful Drugs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expense of building such sites makes Agila a more
attractive acquisition target for a buyer seeking to expand in
that area, said Hitesh Mahida, a Mumbai-based analyst at Fortune
Equity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It takes three to four years to set up a plant,&#8221; Mahida
said in a telephone interview from Mumbai. &#8220;In order to
manufacture cancer injectables, you also need a high degree of
automation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Injectable drugs include powerful antibiotics and
chemotherapy agents that are mostly used in hospitals. As more
drugs lose patent protection, the global market for generic
injectable medicines will swell 42 percent to $17 billion by
2020, according to a May 9 report from Citigroup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agila this month received FDA approval for oxaliplatin, a
cancer treatment. The drug will be distributed in the U.S.
through a two-year-old partnership with Pfizer, the world&#8217;s
biggest drugmaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Manufacturing Crackdown &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A crackdown by the FDA on manufacturing practices at
steriles plants, including Lake Forest, Illinois-based Hospira,
in the past two years has contributed to a shortage in U.S.
hospitals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 215 drugs currently in short supply, most of
which are injectables, according to a list on the American
Society of Health-System Pharmacists website. The shortages,
which involve anesthetics, treatments for cancer, and drugs
needed for emergency medicine, prompted the U.S. government last
month to tighten requirements on drugmakers to warn of potential
shortfalls, according to the FDA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crackdown ensnared India&#8217;s Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. and
Claris Lifesciences Ltd. (CLAR), as well. That &#8220;places Agila in a
unique position as the only manufacturer of high-quality sterile
injectables from India,&#8221; said Ernst  Young&#8217;s KrishnaKumar in a
telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claris said yesterday in a stock exchange filing that it
has addressed the FDA&#8217;s complaints. Its shares surged 20 percent
in Mumbai trading yesterday and climbed 5.1 percent today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Big Pharma &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strides is considering a sale while global drugmakers trawl
India for potential acquisitions to offset a decline in revenue
from expiring patents, according to Ajay Argal, head of Indian
equities at Baring Asset Management Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All the big pharmas are finding it tough to have any
growth, so they have to look at areas where they are not
present,&#8221; said Argal, who manages the Baring India Fund, said
in a telephone interview from Hong Kong. &#8220;They have a lot of
cash, so rather than just keeping it in the balance sheet or
returning it to shareholders, they&#8217;re trying to elongate the
life cycle of their business with acquisitions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any buyer could immediately start generating sales because
Agila has ready-made facilities with all the necessary
approvals, said Ranjit Kapadia, a pharmaceutical analyst at
Centrum Broking. The most likely buyers would be companies
already selling injectable medicines, such as Hospira, said
Kapadia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s Cash &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, which is based in New York, had $24.3 billion of
cash and short-term investments as of July 1, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Pfizer CEO Ian Read said in an interview
last month that the company&#8217;s &#8220;willingness to do deals
externally is driven by the value of the deals.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agila will generate Ebitda in 2012 of 4.19 billion rupees,
or about $75 million, according to analysts&#8217; estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. A sale at 18 to 20 times Ebitda would be in line
with average multiples paid in recent purchases of injectable
drugmakers, according to KrishnaKumar. That implies the business
would fetch at least $1.35 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At this price, a deal would be fairly priced,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign acquirers of Indian pharmaceutical assets have paid
a median of almost 27 times Ebitda during the past five years,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strides sold its Australian and Southeast Asian unit,
Ascent Pharmahealth Ltd., to Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. for
A$375 million ($393 million) in January. Since then, the shares
have risen 71 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Piramal Sale &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strides wouldn&#8217;t be the first Indian generic drugmaker to
fetch more for a unit than equity investors were willing to pay
for the whole company. In 2010, when Abbott Laboratories (ABT) bought
Mumbai-based Piramal Healthcare Ltd.&#8217;s branded generic-medicine
unit for $3.72 billion, it paid more than Piramal&#8217;s entire
market value of $2.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acquisition, which turned Abbott into India&#8217;s largest
drugmaker and gave it a vast portfolio of generic drugs,
highlights the motives of global pharmaceutical companies, said
Prashant Nair, a Mumbai-based analyst at Citigroup Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Abbott was desperate to grow its presence in India,&#8221; he
said in a telephone interview. &#8220;The equity investor focuses on
factors like growth and profitability, but would not pay an
ownership premium. For a big pharma company, however, the motive
is largely strategic and they would be willing to pay more to
get ownership of a local entity to acquire a footprint that may
be difficult to develop organically.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Arun Kumar &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, selling the unit would leave Arun Kumar, Strides&#8217;s
co-founder and owner of 28.3 percent of the company, without the
company&#8217;s most profitable business and the source of half of its
Ebitda. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s difficult to understand what will be left if they
sell this business,&#8221; said Siddhant Khandekar, an analyst at
ICICI Direct. &#8220;The rest of the business is just a plain vanilla
generic business that has no spark. I don&#8217;t think Arun will
sell.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That won&#8217;t be a problem if the price is high enough, said
Centrum Broking&#8217;s Kapadia. After Piramal agreed to sell its
branded generics unit, which accounted for more than half of the
drugmaker&#8217;s total revenue, the company paid a special cash
dividend. The company controlled by billionaire Ajay Piramal has
since been on an acquisition spree, buying a stake in Vodafone
Plc.&#8217;s Indian unit, a diagnostics portfolio from Bayer AG and
the health-care research provider Decision Resources Group LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Like it happened with Piramal, if the valuation is good,
they will sell,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tax agreement that would impose

&lt;p&gt;The German state would buy data on Swiss banks&#8217; clients

&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Sarika Gangar" date="Aug 20, 2012  5:46 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-20/jpmorgan-doubles-offering-to-sell-1-1-billion-of-preferreds.html"><headline>JPMorgan Doubles Offering to Sell $1.1 Billion of Preferreds</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. lender by assets, sold $1.1 billion of perpetual preferred
shares, more than double what it had planned, after selling $2.5
billion of bonds earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank issued $25 shares, callable after five years, to
yield 5.5 percent, Bloomberg data show. The offering was earlier
marketed at $500 million, according to a person familiar with
the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have seen financials hit the market more aggressively
recently,&#8221; Marc Pinto, head of corporate bond strategy at
Susquehanna International Group LLP, said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;It has been a particularly active market as of late
for preferreds.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan last issued benchmark dollar-denominated debt on
Aug. 13, selling 2 percent, five-year bonds to yield 135 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The debt traded at 99.68 cents on the
dollar to yield 2.07 percent on Aug. 17, according to Trace, the
bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are selling preferred shares in part to get ready for
changes in capital regulations linked to the Basel III
international banking requirements, Pinto said. There has been
$7.5 billion in $25 per share preferred issuance over the past
six weeks, according to Pinto. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Basel III &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Basel III guidelines, which will be phased in from 2013
to 2019, call on regulators to boost capital requirements for
banks, limit what instruments count toward capital and force
banks to rely more on equity than debt funding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Rates are extremely low so it&#8217;s a very attractive market
for them to issue in,&#8221; Pinto said. &#8220;Investors are looking for
yield, and it&#8217;s very hard to find these days, so a number of
people are going to the preferred market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co (WFC) sold $750 million of preferred shares at
5.2 percent on Aug. 9, Bloomberg data show. Capital One
Financial Corp. (COF) issued $875 million of preferreds at 6 percent
on Aug. 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s new shares may be rated Ba1, the highest level
of speculative grade, by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the terms aren&#8217;t

&lt;p&gt;Barnes  Noble Inc. (BKS)&#8217;s stock surged a
record 52 percent on April 30, the day Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) swooped
in with an offer to buy a stake in the money-losing retailer and
fund its expansion into electronic books. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euphoria has evaporated as it becomes clear that even
with Microsoft&#8217;s considerable resources and push into tablets
and mobile computing, a rapidly changing competitive environment
means the largest U.S. bookstore chain will still struggle to
avoid the fate of the music and movie stores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares have slid 41 percent since the announcement as
investors digest Barnes  Noble&#8217;s mounting woes: another loss,
sliding sales of printed books, and slowing revenue growth of
Nook e-readers and tablets, which could soon face new
competition from a smaller and cheaper Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPad. Analysts
project more losses when the bookseller reports first-quarter
earnings tomorrow, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn&#8217;t help that Microsoft and Barnes  Noble have been
vague about how their partnership will turn things around, said
Peter Wahlstrom, an analyst for Morningstar Inc. (MORN) in Chicago.
Barnes  Noble must &#8220;prove they can make this into a viable
model and they haven&#8217;t done that yet,&#8221; he said. Microsoft&#8217;s
involvement &#8220;doesn&#8217;t fix it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a price-to-sales basis, Barnes  Noble trades at a 90
percent discount to the 32-company Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
Retailing Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
bookseller has annual revenue of $7.1 billion and a market
capitalization of $739.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both companies declined to offer more details, or make
executives available to be interviewed for this story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nook Foothold &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Barnes  Noble released its first tablet, the Nook
Color, in 2010, it quickly gained a foothold as one of the few
inexpensive alternatives to the iPad. The chain managed to grab
share in large part because it converted a section of its stores
into Nook showrooms. A majority of the company&#8217;s e-readers and
tablets are sold at its 691 locations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a year after the Nook Color debut, Amazon (AMZN).com Inc.&#8217;s
Kindle Fire arrived with a similar price and began grabbing
customers. Google Inc. (GOOG) entered the market last month with the
Nexus 7 and Apple may join the fray in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with rising competition, the New York-based chain
tried luring customers with free gift cards and e-books; now
it&#8217;s discounting. On Aug. 12, it marked down the Nook Color and
Tablet, cutting the price on the 8-gigabyte Tablet 10 percent to
$179. Comparable Fire and Nexus 7 versions sell for $199. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Protecting Share &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the discounting squeezes margins, Barnes  Noble is
trying to protect and expand its hard-won 25 percent share of
the U.S. e-book market -- a portion it never attained in printed
books. It&#8217;s easy to see why. Content sales, which include
digital books and such apps as Angry Birds, more than doubled
last year to $483 million while sales at its stores and website
declined 1.5 percent to $4.85 billion. Content also generates
gross margin above 30 percent, compared with a 27 percent margin
for the whole company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Amazon, Barnes  Noble is selling its e-readers and
tablets at a loss or break-even to lock customers into its
system. Chief Executive Officer William Lynch has called this
acquiring &#8220;digital lockers&#8221; with the belief that once
consumers begin building an e-book collection within the Nook
universe, they will keep buying from it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The idea is not to get every human being to have a Nook
device,&#8221; said David Schick, an analyst for Stifel Nicolaus, who
recommends holding the shares. &#8220;It&#8217;s to get people who read a
lot to be on their platform.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Less Hardware &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has said it will focus less on hardware going
forward. That means Barnes  Noble will become increasingly
reliant on selling e-books via devices from Apple, Google and
Microsoft. Many Kindle owners traded to the iPad and still buy
books from Amazon and use its app to read them. The big question
is whether the tie-up with Microsoft will help Barnes  Noble
pull off the same trick -- keeping its millions of Nook
customers loyal and hooking new ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the companies have said about the deal is that it&#8217;s
expected to close before the end of the year and the Nook app
will be &#8220;deeply integrated&#8221; into Windows 8, the first version
of Microsoft&#8217;s operating system that will power tablets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That may mean users are prompted to make a pre-loaded Nook
app their default reader, as Apple does with its iBooks, or it
could be promoted in the Windows app store with free e-books.
Yet because Amazon and Rakuten Inc. (4755)&#8217;s Kobo brand are also making
apps for Windows 8, Barnes  Noble will have plenty of
competition as it chases new customers, Wahlstrom said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wider Distribution &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows 8, debuting in October, will be installed on 122
million devices, including 6.7 million tablets, by the end of
2013, according to IDC, a Framingham, Massachusetts-based
researcher. That potentially will give Barnes  Noble wider
distribution and its first move overseas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the deal, the Nook digital bookstore must be
available via Windows 8 in 10 countries within a year. The
digital book market is more up for grabs outside the U.S., where
e-reading isn&#8217;t as widespread, although Amazon and Rakuten are
already selling e-books in more than 100 countries. Barnes 
Noble said today that it will begin selling the Nook and e-books
in the U.K. by the end of this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnes  Noble should have the cash to stay competitive.
Besides paying $300 million for an 18 percent stake in a Nook
subsidiary that may be spun off into a standalone company,
Microsoft has also agreed to spend another $305 million over
five years on revenue sharing and capital expenditure payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Barnes  Noble has yoked its future to a company
struggling with its own reinvention. While Microsoft is
releasing its own tablet, Surface, the software maker has mostly
failed to create best-selling gadgets, with the exception of the
Xbox game console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Apple and Google have a formidable head start in
the fastest-growing part of the computer industry. &#8220;There&#8217;s no
question Microsoft is late to the tablet market,&#8221; said Al Gillen, an IDC analyst. &#8220;They have some catching up to do.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), Europe&#8217;s
largest oil company, will swap fields with Chevron Corp. (CVX) and pay
$450 million to raise a stake in Australia&#8217;s Browse gas titles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell will boost its holdings in the West Browse fields to
35 percent and East Browse to 25 percent, it said today in a
statement. Chevron will get Shell&#8217;s 33.3 percent in Clio and
Acme, expanding its resource base for the Wheatstone liquefied
natural gas project, the U.S. company said separately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a good deal, not only because it aligns with
Shell&#8217;s strategy of bigger direct stakes in key gas resources,
but because it also helps to simplify the ownership of the
Browse gas fields,&#8221; said Andy Brown, upstream international
director at Shell. &#8220;The Browse gas fields are a key LNG
development opportunity for Australia.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron and Shell are among companies investing about $180
billion in the development of seven LNG ventures in Australia to
meet growing demand for energy in Asia. The two companies are
investors in the Browse and Wheatstone LNG projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exchange &#8220;fits strategically with our long-term plans
to grow our Wheatstone area resource base, and create expansion
opportunities for the Wheatstone project,&#8221; said George Kirkland, a vice chairman at Chevron. Shell, based in The Hague,
will exit the Clio-Acme titles in the Carnarvon Basin where
Chevron has made at least six natural-gas discoveries, according
to the San Ramon, California-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The West and East Browse titles cover the Torosa, Brecknock
and Calliance fields, which will supply to Browse LNG, Shell
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although law firm revenues increased
slightly in the first half of 2012, the growth in expenses
outpaced the revenue increase during the same period. That&#8217;s the
takeaway of the recent quarterly survey of the law firm group of
the Citi Private Bank of Citigroup Inc. (C) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gretta Rusanow, the senior client adviser in the Citigroup
business, said in a telephone interview on Aug. 17 that while
revenues increased 2.7 percent compared with the first six
months of 2011, compensation expenses increased about 2 percent
and operating expenses, such as rent, infrastructure upgrades,
and insurance, went up 5.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the growth in headcount also exceeded the 0.3
percent growth in demand for attorneys&#8217; services, according to
the survey of 176 law firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rusanow said that transactional work is slower than
litigation. While in the past the pace of litigation can offset
a slow deal market, she said corporate clients are pressuring
their law firms to discount the bills for litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, Rusanow said, &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter what end of
the market you&#8217;re sitting in, demand is down. And no one is
immune.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Layoffs haven&#8217;t occurred she said. Instead, firms have cut
compensation costs by not awarding spring bonuses to their
associates like last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless the market picks up, Rusanow said that &#8220;there will
be a struggle to achieve even the low single digit profit growth
we predicted at the start of the year. We&#8217;re concerned.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dewey Committee of Ex-Partners Wants Examiner for Defunct Firm &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although appointing a trustee to take over Dewey  LeBoeuf
LLP is &#8220;premature,&#8221; an examiner should be appointed for the
defunct law firm, the official committee representing former
partners said in a court filing Aug. 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the filing, the committee was critical of a settlement
proposal the firm is offering to former partners which would
give those partners releases from claims and lawsuits in return
for payments in varying amounts. The Wall Street Journal
reported last week that the settlement is at least $50 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official committee argues that the firm &#8220;simply lacks
fiduciary credentials to decide how much each partner should be
permitted to pay&#8221; because it&#8217;s &#8220;managed solely by individuals
who remain partners and who were actively engaged in many of the
debtor&#8217;s most controversial pre-petition actions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The committee criticized the firm for offering discounts in
return for collecting unpaid bills, &#8220;further rewarding those
with the largest practices for doing only that which they are
already obligated to do.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The filing is especially critical of the firm&#8217;s demand for
payments from lawyers who retired years before bankruptcy. The
committee says that the demand for subsidies from retirees
&#8220;cries out, at a minimum, for vetting by an entirely
disinterested fiduciary.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ad hoc group of 54 former partners filed papers on Aug.
8 telling the bankruptcy judge in Manhattan that the firm should
be taken over by a Chapter 11 trustee or an examiner appointed
to conduct an investigation into management&#8217;s &#8220;blatant
conflicts of interest.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a large case such as Dewey&#8217;s, the bankruptcy judge is
required to appoint an examiner if a motion for a trustee is
denied. A judge retains the ability to decide the scope and cost
of an examiner&#8217;s report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A call for comment to the firm&#8217;s lawyers wasn&#8217;t returned.
There is a separate official committee representing creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dewey, which once had 1,300 lawyers, began liquidation
under Chapter 11 in May. There was secured debt of about $225
million and accounts receivable of $217.4 million at the outset
of bankruptcy, the firm said. The petition listed assets of $193
million and liabilities of $245.4 million as of April 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Dewey  LeBoeuf LLP, 12-12321, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lawyer Sues News Corp. for Hacking in 2007 Prosecutor Affair &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News Corp. (NWSA) and the former private investigator who hacked
phones for the News of the World tabloid were sued in Britain by
a criminal-defense lawyer who newspapers said in 2007 had an
affair with the country&#8217;s chief prosecutor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit by Kirsty Brimelow, of Doughty Street Chambers
in London, was filed against News Corp.&#8217;s U.K. unit, which
published the now-defunct title, and Glenn Mulcaire, 41, in the
High Court on Aug. 13, according to court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brimelow had an affair with Ken Macdonald, who at the time
led the U.K. Crown Prosecution Service, the Telegraph and other
titles reported in February 2007. The alleged relationship made
headlines about a month after Macdonald&#8217;s agency secured prison
terms for Mulcaire and the News of the World&#8217;s Royal Family
reporter Clive Goodman. While the men pleaded guilty to phone
hacking, the case failed to uncover the extent of the scandal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch closed the News of the
World in July 2011 after revelations it intercepted the voice
mail of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler in 2002, when she was
still missing. The company is cooperating with police after
admitting some of its journalists targeted celebrities,
politicians, crime victims and people close to them until 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. tabloids published photographs of the two lawyers
dining together and stationed reporters outside their homes in
February 2007 to get reactions from them and Macdonald&#8217;s wife,
according to news articles at the time. Neither Brimelow nor
Macdonald commented on the reports of the affair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mulcaire&#8217;s lawyer, Sarah Webb, declined to comment. Daisy Dunlop, a spokeswoman for News International, declined to
comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brimelow didn&#8217;t return calls or e-mails over three days
seeking comment. The details of her claims weren&#8217;t immediately
available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macdonald, who was director of public prosecutions at CPS
from 2003 to 2008, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Brimelow QC v. Newsgroup Newspapers,
HC12A03219, High Court of Justice Chancery Division. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Capital Markets &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wilson Sonsini, Goodwin Procter on Trulia IPO &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trulia Inc., an Internet startup focused on residential
real estate, filed to raise $75 million in an initial public
offering, aiming to capitalize on an improving U.S. housing
market. The company plans to list its shares on the New York
Stock Exchange under the symbol TRLA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Segre and Rezwan Pavri, partners in the Palo
Alto office of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich  Rosati represent the
company. Richard Kline and Anthony McCusker, partners in the
Menlo Park, California, office of Goodwin Procter LLP&#160;represent
the underwriters, JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Deutsche Bank AG,
along with RBC Capital Markets LLC, Needham  Co. and William
Blair  Co. Trulia&#8217;s general counsel Scott Darling is also
listed in the regulatory filing made on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The filing was made under the streamlined regulations for
smaller companies enacted as part of the Jumpstart Our Business
Startups Act, known as the JOBS Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law accelerates the registration process of firms with
less than $1 billion of annual revenue and gives companies the
ability to &#8220;crowd-fund&#8221; by selling its stock online, among
other provisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Segre said that the impact of the new law on the filing of
a registration statement for an IPO was minimal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are allowances for less disclosure under the JOBS
Act related to a number of items like executive compensation and
the financial statements but&#8221; companies aren&#8217;t taking advantage
of the provisions because the markets expect fuller disclosure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said in an e-mail that the primary benefit derives from
the confidentiality provisions of the law, which allow small
companies with less than $1 billion in revenues to receive
comments from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission before
the filings become public as Trulia&#8217;s did on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trulia is a rival to Zillow Inc. (Z), which raised $69.2
million in its IPO in July 2011 and has seen its shares jump 79
percent since its market debut. The number of new-home building
permits grew in the U.S. last month, indicating that the
industry will keep improving in the second half of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trulia&#8217;s search engine is used by more than 20 million
people a month to look for homes in specific neighborhoods. The
company offers reviews on local schools and crime rates. The
company makes money through ads on the site and subscriptions
that let real estate agents target users and get their listings
featured prominently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Law Firm Mergers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;KL Gates, Middletons in Talks About Possible Combination &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KL Gates LLP and Australian national law firm Middletons
are in discussions regarding a possible combination, according
to a statement by KL Gates. If approved, the combination would
create a firm of more than 2,000 lawyers in 45 offices
throughout Australia, North and South America, Europe, Asia, and
the Middle East. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the statement, discussions between the two
firms have been under way for several months with formal
proposals expected to be presented to both partnerships later in
2012. KL Gates spokesman Jeffrey Berardi said in an e-mail that
KL Gates has about 1,800 lawyers and Middletons has about 300
lawyers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) said its bid to bring a
new rheumatoid arthritis pill to the market has been delayed as
much as three months by U.S. regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision by the Food and Drug Administration had been
expected after New York-based Pfizer said on July 31 it would
provide the agency with additional analysis of existing data
that may require more time to review. The FDA had been scheduled
to decide on approval of the drug, called tofacitinib, by today
and now will have until Nov. 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The FDA determined that additional data analyses recently
submitted by Pfizer constitute a major amendment to the
application and will require additional time to review,&#8221; Pfizer
said in a statement today announcing the delay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tofacitinib is a pill that inhibits part of the immune
system that can cause rheumatoid arthritis. If approved, it may
generate $2.3 billion in annual sales for Pfizer by 2018,
according to an estimate by Seamus Fernandez, an analyst with
Leerink Swann  Co. in Boston. It would compete with Abbott
Laboratories (ABT) Humira and Johnson  Johnson (JNJ)&#8217;s Remicade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares fell less than 1 percent to $23.69 at the
close of New York trading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Co. SA (EEEK),
the world&#8217;s second-largest bottler of Coke drinks, posted a 15
percent decline in second-quarter profit as poor weather and
austerity measures in European markets slowed demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income fell to 119.6 million euros ($148 million) in
the three months to June 30 from 141.4 million euros a year
earlier, Athens-based Coca-Cola HBC said today in a statement on
its website. Revenue in the quarter rose to 1.99 billion euros
from 1.97 billion euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Strong currency headwinds and higher input costs also
adversely affected profit in the quarter,&#8221; Dimitris Lois, chief
executive officer, said in a telephone interview today.
&#8220;Despite this we grew revenue ahead of volume for the fourth
consecutive quarter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro declined 5.1 percent against the dollar in the
second quarter as the region&#8217;s debt crisis intensified and
economic growth slowed. Coca-Cola HBC pays in dollars for raw
materials such as PET, used to make plastic bottles, and for
aluminium to make cans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower prices for PET are now easing input costs &#8220;and we
expect these to show a mid-single digit increase for 2012
compared with a previous forecast for a high single digit
rise,&#8221; Lois said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This benefit will be offset by unfavorable foreign currency
movements, reflecting the decline in the euro against the dollar
and the impact of the euro area&#8217;s debt crisis on currencies in
emerging and developing markets, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Challenging Trade &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company expects &#8220;challenging trading conditions&#8221; to
persist across most of its markets with a further deterioration
in disposable income and weak consumer confidence in markets
such as Greece, Italy, Ireland, Hungary and the Czech Republic,
according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given a macroeconomic environment which is getting
tougher and the negative currency impact, we will accelerate
restructuring initiatives planned for 2013 and bring the
majority of them into the fourth quarter this year,&#8221; Michalis Imellos, chief financial officer, said today in a telephone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Savings this year from these changes and others already
made in 2011, will now rise by 10 million euros to 50 million
euros while from 2013 onwards savings will reach 70 million
euros, up from 35 million euros, Imellos said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cases of drinks sold in emerging markets, which include
Ukraine and Romania, rose 2 percent to 292.2 million in the
second quarter boosted by higher sales in Russia. &#8220;We see the
economic and trading environment in Russia improving and we
expect the country to continue to drive volume growth in the
emerging market segment,&#8221; Lois said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola HBC reiterated capital spending guidance for
2012-14 of 1.45 billion euros and the same amount in free cash
flow generation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York City and Massachusetts are
turning to a mixture of philanthropy and profit to fund projects
tackling homelessness and inmate recidivism, using a program
that can offer investors returns as high as 13 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s the first embrace in the U.S. of a public-private
funding method known as social-impact bonds. Also called pay-
for-success contracts or social-innovation financing, the model
allows governments to transfer the risk of expanding prevention
programs to investors. Taxpayer money is spent only if the
results exceed a measurable goal set by both parties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This makes it possible to invest more in prevention,
which are often the first programs that get cut in fiscal
stress,&#8221; said George Overholser, chief executive officer of
Third Sector Capital Partners, a nonprofit financial-advisory
firm in Cambridge, Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s also a way to be sure that the programs that get
funding are also the programs that work,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And it&#8217;s a
way to align socially progressive goals with fiscally
conservative goals, which is a real political winner.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overholser, who was on the founding management team of
Capital One Financial Corp. (COF), has been advocating innovations in
social financing since 2001. His company is advising the
nonprofits that will run Massachusetts&#8217;s programs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aemetis Inc. (AMTX), a U.S. producer of
biofuels and renewable chemicals, plans to make jet fuel and
diesel using technology developed by a joint venture of Chevron
Corp. (CVX) and Chicago Bridge  Iron Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology from Chevron Lummus Global LLC uses water to
convert plant oils into products that are similar to petroleum
crude and are refined into fuel, Cupertino, California-based
Aemetis said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Licensing the technology will accelerate Aemetis&#8217;s efforts
to commercialize &#8220;drop-in&#8221; renewable jet fuel and diesel.
These differ from competing biofuels because they may be used
without blending standard, petroleum-based products, said Leon
de Bruyn, managing director of Chevron Lummus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The biodiesel and biojet produced from the unit are truly
fungible&#8221; products that replace petroleum-derived fuels, he
said in the statement. Chevron Lummus is equally owned by
Chevron and CBI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aemetis plans to use the technology at its North American
facilities. Under the non-exclusive license, the company will
pay a 10-cent-a-gallon royalty fee, &#8220;with certain decreases&#8221;
based on the volume of fuel produced, according to a filing
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aemetis owns a corn-ethanol plant in Keyes, California,
that can produce 55 million gallons (208 million liters) of fuel
annually, and a plant in India with annual capacity of 50
million gallons of biodiesel, edible oil and glycerin, according
to its website. The company has been developing its own process
to make fuel from plant-based sugars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This technology is ideally suited for the conversion of
existing biofuels production facilities,&#8221; Aemetis Chief
Executive Officer and Chairman Eric McAfee said in the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. oil refiners must blend with their products 36 billion
gallons of biofuels a year by 2022, according to Environmental
Protection Agency regulations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen M. Scherr, head of financing
and Latin America at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), sold his Fifth
Avenue co-op in Manhattan for $5.6 million, almost four months
after buying a home on Park Avenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale of Scherr&#8217;s fifth-floor apartment at 1148 Fifth
Ave. was completed on Aug. 9 and made public yesterday,
according to New York City Department of Finance records. The
buyers were listed as Esther and Marcel Kremer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apartment is one of 59 units in a &#8220;white glove&#8221;
prewar building between 95th and 96th Streets, with views of
Central Park, according to property-listings website
StreetEasy.com. In April, Scherr bought a seven-bedroom, full-floor co-operative apartment at 1185 Park Ave. for $12.3
million, according to public records and StreetEasy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scherr didn&#8217;t immediately return a telephone message left
at his New York office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scherr, who oversees Goldman Sachs&#8217;s operations in Latin
America and runs underwriting, was appointed to the firm&#8217;s
management committee in January. The 30-member committee
&#8220;oversees the global activities of the firm&#8221; and &#8220;is
comprised of the most senior leaders of the firm,&#8221; according to
the firm&#8217;s annual report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has tightened visa rules for
visitors, adding requirements for a letter of invitation and
proof of hotel reservations in a move that could slow its push
to become the world&#8217;s biggest tourism destination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travelers applying for tourist visas, must submit a letter
from an &#8220;authorized tourism unit,&#8221; company or person inviting
them to China, along with a photocopy of their round-trip ticket
and hotel reservation, according to rules posted on the website
of China&#8217;s embassy in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule changes come after Chinese authorities have put
foreigners&#8217; status in the country under greater scrutiny and
sought to clamp down on people entering the country illegally.
The World Tourism Organization has predicted that China may
become the world&#8217;s biggest destination for tourists by 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If implemented strictly, the new requirements could have
an impact on the number of foreign tourists&#8221; and revenue among
travel agencies, said Zhang Lu, a Shanghai-based analyst at
Capital Securities Corp. (6005) China International Travel Service
Corp. (601888), the country&#8217;s biggest tourism company by market value,
will &#8220;certainly be affected,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new visa materials were not demanded before Aug. 1,
according to visa.ywpw.com, a Texas-based agency that helps
customers obtain visas to China. China&#8217;s embassies and
consulates in countries including Japan, Thailand and New
Zealand also posted the new rules on their websites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tourism Destination &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China overtook Spain in 2010 to become the world&#8217;s third-
biggest tourist draw, with 55.7 million visitors that year,
behind only France and the U.S., according to data from the
World Bank. That&#8217;s more than double number of tourist arrivals
in 1999, when China saw 27 million visitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Ministry didn&#8217;t respond to faxed questions
seeking comment today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mid-May, Beijing began a 100-day campaign aimed at
cracking down on foreigners working or living in the country
without proper documentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National People&#8217;s Congress, the country&#8217;s legislature,
approved a new law June 30 that increased the penalty for
illegally entering or working in the country. In a blog post in
May, a top host for China&#8217;s state-owned national television
station, Yang Rui, said Chinese police should focus on Sanlitun
and another Beijing neighborhood, Wudaokou, to &#8220;arrest foreign
thugs and protect innocent girls.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, settled a patent lawsuit over the application by
Impax Laboratories Inc. (IPXL) to sell a copy of the bladder-control
treatment Detrol LA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terms of the accord weren&#8217;t fully disclosed in a filing
yesterday in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, referring to a
license agreement dated Aug. 16 between the two companies.
Pfizer sued Impax in 2008, claiming it infringed three patents
in applying for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to
copy its extended-release capsules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement bars Impax from selling any generic version
of the drug during the life of two of the patents &#8220;except as
permitted under the settlement and license agreement&#8221; between
the companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detrol and Detrol LA generated $883 million in global sales
last year for Pfizer, including $557 million in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pfizer confirms that it has settled its patent
infringement lawsuit against Impax Labs involving Pfizer&#8217;s
patents covering Detrol LA,&#8221; Christopher Loder, a spokesman for
New York-based Pfizer, said in an e-mail. &#8220;The terms of this
agreement are confidential.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Donohue, a spokesman for Hayward, California-based
Impax, couldn&#8217;t immediately be reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Pfizer Inc. v. Impax Laboratories, 2:08-
cv-02137, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey (Newark). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) said today it wants to
partner with YPF SA (YPFD), Argentina&#8217;s biggest oil producer, in
developing the company&#8217;s Vaca Muerta shale formation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are open to strategically partnering with YPF,&#8221; Ali Moshiri, president of Chevron&#8217;s Africa and Latin America
exploration and production unit, told reporters in Buenos Aires.
&#8220;We are looking forward to working with the government.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moshiri spoke after YPF Chief Executive Officer Miguel Galuccio said in a speech that the state-controlled company will
unveil its contract model on Aug. 30 for three types of
partnerships to develop Vaca Muerta. YPF, seized from Repsol SA
in April, needs financial and operational partners, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaca Muerta is a Connecticut-size area in southern
Argentina that may contain at least 23 billion barrels. Galuccio
described the shale formation as the &#8220;tip of the iceberg&#8221; for
YPF&#8217;s oil projects. The company, based in Buenos Aires, has
drilled 45 wells at the shale development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner
nationalized YPF in April, saying Madrid-based Repsol under-
invested since it acquired YPF in 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YPF also plans to drill for coal-bed methane gas in Buenos
Aires Province, Gallucio said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Jef Feeley" date="Aug 23, 2012  4:44 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-23/pfizer-asks-end-to-fen-phen-suits-linked-to-lung-ailment.html"><headline>Pfizer Asks End to Fen-Phen Suits Linked to Lung Ailment</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), whose Wyeth unit set
aside more than $21 billion to settle lawsuits over the fen-phen
diet drug, asked a judge to throw out claims that the pills
caused a fatal disease years after users stopped taking them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s lawyers asked a federal judge in Philadelphia
today to bar cases from going to trial that allege former fen-
phen users developed primary pulmonary hypertension, also known
as PPH, nine or more years after they last used the appetite
suppressant. Wyeth withdrew the diet-drug combination from the
market in 1997 after it was linked to heart problems and PPH, an
often-fatal lung ailment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker contends in court filings there&#8217;s &#8220;no
reliable scientific evidence&#8221; to back up claims that using fen-
phen can cause PPH years later. Plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers say studies
show the diet aid has a so-called latency period that can cause
the disease to arise 15 years after its use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is crucial that the court exercise its gatekeeper
function to stop these PPH suits now,&#8221; New York-based Pfizer
told U.S. District Judge Harvey Bartle III in court filings.
Bartle is overseeing some of the remaining 30 PPH cases pending
against the drugmaker. The company is making the same arguments
to bar cases in a state court in Philadelphia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Pfizer&#8217;s challenge to the PPH latency argument is
successful, it will wipe out the last significant litigation
tied to the drug&#8217;s recall, said Alex MacDonald, a Boston-based
plaintiffs&#8217; lawyer who has litigated cases over the diet aid for
more than a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Science &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a scientifically baseless effort to slam shut the
courthouse doors to scores of dying women afflicted with a
lethal disease caused solely by these diet pills,&#8221; MacDonald
said this week in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, acquired Wyeth in a
$68 billion buyout in 2009. It also acquired a more than
$21 billion liability for the fen-phen cases, many of which had
been consolidated in federal court in Philadelphia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 6 million prescriptions were written for the diet
combination before it was withdrawn. Consumers took the
company&#8217;s Pondimin or Redux drugs as well as the generic
Phentermine to help suppress their appetites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyeth once faced more than 175,000 claims over the diet
combination. Former users accused the drugmaker of hiding its
health risks to generate billions in profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;National Settlement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyeth officials sought to resolve the litigation by setting
up a $3.75 billion national settlement program for former users
in 2000. Costs of settlements forced the drugmaker to add
$1.3 billion to the fund in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The skyrocketing costs of the settlements and litigation
ultimately forced the drugmaker to boost reserves to more than
$21 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the number of PPH cases Wyeth has faced has been
relatively small, claims over the fatal lung disease have
generated verdicts and settlements for tens of millions of
dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A state-court jury in Beaumont, Texas, ordered Wyeth in
April 2004 to pay more than $1 billion to the family of a former
fen-phen user who died from PPH. The panel awarded Cynthia
Cappel-Coffey&#8217;s family $113 million in compensatory damages and
$900 million in punitive damages over the company&#8217;s mishandling
of the combination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testimony showed that Cappel-Coffey, an X-ray technician,
took Pondimin for five months in 1997 and was diagnosed with PPH
in February 2002. She died the following year at age 41. Cappel-
Coffey&#8217;s case later was settled for an undisclosed sum,
according to her lawyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Month&#8217;s Use &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyeth officials also agreed to pay at least $10 million in
2000 to settle claims brought by the family of a Massachusetts
woman who used the fen-phen combination for less than a month
before developing PPH and dying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker&#8217;s lawyers filed their PPH latency challenge
this year as two new cases were set for trial in the federal and
state courts in Philadelphia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyeth&#8217;s attorneys contend that Jamie Cheek and Valarie
Farmer can&#8217;t prove their PPH cases were caused by their diet-
drug use in the 1990s. Cheek&#8217;s symptoms didn&#8217;t appear for nine
years after her last use of the drug, and Farmer&#8217;s became
evident 11 years after she stopped taking it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the drugmaker wins, its lawyers plan to use the rulings
in those two cases to keep the remaining PPH cases around the
country from going to trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Proper Cases &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PPH cases were excluded from the national settlement. Wyeth
officials specifically defined what constituted a proper PPH
case to be litigated outside the accord, Raymond Williams and
Heidi Levine, two of Pfizer&#8217;s lawyers, said in a July 7 filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The definition requires plaintiffs to present evidence
ruling out alternative causes for their PPH other than diet-drug
use, Pfizer&#8217;s attorneys said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;PPH is not a signature disease that is necessarily
associated with diet-drug use,&#8221; according to the filing. &#8220;It
has many non-diet-drug causes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anand Agneshwar, a Pfizer lawyer, told Bartle at today&#8217;s
hearing that the settlement requires plaintiffs&#8217; doctors to do
an exhaustive review of the possible causes of the former fen-
phen user&#8217;s PPH. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The physician &#8220;must rule out other conditions&#8221; that could
have caused the ailment, such as sleep apnea, Agneshwar said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Year After &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also contends the risks of developing PPH tied
to diet-drug use drop a year after the last use of the pills,
according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plaintiffs with cases pending &#8220;ingested diet drugs nearly
a decade or more before the onset of their symptoms and there is
no reliable evidence of risk today,&#8221; Chris Loder, a company
spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plaintiffs still file PPH cases against the drugmaker,
forcing it to spend money to evaluate claims that are sometimes
as much as 11 years old, Pfizer&#8217;s lawyers said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Part of the essential bargain of the National Settlement
Agreement was an end to settled diet-drug claims, including
claims for pulmonary hypertension when the plaintiff could not
rule out other causes of the disease,&#8221; Pfizer&#8217;s lawyers argued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nearly 15 years later, defendants are entitled to the
benefit of their bargained-for release,&#8221; the lawyers wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for PPH claimants counter in their filings that
respected medical researchers have concluded diet-drug use can
be one of the triggers of the lung disease and that it has an
undetermined latency period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;No Risk&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorneys for former users said another federal judge who
studied the PPH latency issue found in 2002 that experts
dismissed the idea that there &#8220;is no risk beyond 12 months of
last use,&#8221; according to an Aug. 6 filing by Michael Fishbein, a
Philadelphia-based lawyer representing fen-phen claimants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical researchers agree that &#8220;every known cause of PPH
has a significant period of latency of up to a decade or more,&#8221;
Fishbein told Bartle at today&#8217;s hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sean Tracey, a Houston-based lawyer who has PPH cases
pending against Wyeth, said the company&#8217;s filings show the push
to have the cases thrown out is motivated more by frustration
over the long-running diet-drug litigation than scientific
positions on the latency issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They seem to be tired of writing checks,&#8221; Tracey said in
an interview this month. &#8220;I&#8217;ve told them that my clients are
tired of dying and that these cases deserve to go forward.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loder, Pfizer&#8217;s spokesman, declined to comment on whether
Pfizer officials were frustrated by the continuing PPH
litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are in Re Diet Drugs Products Liability
Litigation, MDL No. 1203, and Brown v. American Home Products
Corp., 2:99-cv-20593, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Pennsylvania (Philadelphia). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) unveiled its first
new logo in 25 years as it prepares to introduce Windows 8, an
updated version of its flagship software that will power the
company&#8217;s own Surface tablet and other touch-screen devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logo uses the so-called Segoe font, which is used in
Microsoft products and marketing materials, and four colored
squares that are &#8220;intended to express the company&#8217;s diverse
portfolio of products,&#8221; the Redmond, Washington-based company
said on its blog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker, has revamped
products including Windows, phone software and the Xbox game
machine to adopt a sleeker, more modern-looking design to
compete with Apple Inc. (AAPL) for style-conscious consumers. The
colored squares in the new logo resemble the tiles found on
touch-screen phones and tablets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new logo is meant &#8220;to show that this isn&#8217;t your
father&#8217;s Microsoft, and there is something fresh, but also
familiar,&#8221; said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at market
research firm Gartner Inc. It also helps to show Windows and
Microsoft&#8217;s overall new design language, formerly known as
Metro, are &#8220;relevant and aspirational to the market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The redesign comes as consumers are increasingly choosing
the tablets over laptops, weakening personal-computer sales and
curbing Windows revenue. The company has said it plans to
release Windows 8 on Oct. 26 and the Surface with an ARM
Holdings Plc-based chip at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gamesa Corporacion Tecnologica SA (GAM)
won a 74.65-megawatt wind turbine order in India from Goldman
Sachs Group Inc.-backed ReNew Wind Power Pvt. Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gamesa will supply and commission 50 megawatts of G97 2-

&lt;p&gt;Spot gasoline on the Gulf Coast
strengthened after a report that Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) halted output
at the only catalytic cracker at its Beaumont, Texas, refinery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repairs on the unit, which turns heavier feedstock into
lighter transportation fuels like gasoline, may take six to 10
days, EnergyNewsToday reported, without citing a source for the
information. The 345,000-barrel-a-day refinery reported
equipment failure yesterday resulting in flaring from the
cracker and &#8220;some impact on production,&#8221; according to a filing
with state regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional, 87-octane gasoline on the Gulf Coast
strengthened 2.12 cents to a 13.5-cents-a-gallon premium over
gasoline futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at
4:11 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s board of
directors assigned former KPMG International Chairman Timothy Flynn to its risk committee after an internal probe blamed lax
controls for a $5.8 billion trading loss in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flynn, who retired from the accounting firm in October and
was elected to JPMorgan&#8217;s board in May, joined the risk panel in
July, said Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for New York-based
lender. JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon,
56, is the largest bank in the U.S. by assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk committee came under scrutiny after the trading
loss became public May 10, when it was estimated at $2 billion.
JPMorgan blamed large and illiquid trades at the chief
investment office that couldn&#8217;t be unwound without disrupting
markets. The risk panel&#8217;s three members included only one with
Wall Street experience, James Crown, and he hadn&#8217;t been employed
in the industry for more than 25 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other members included Ellen Futter, 62, president of
the American Museum of Natural History, who sat on American
International Group Inc. (AIG)&#8217;s governance committee in 2008, and
David Cote, 60, chief executive officer of Honeywell
International Inc. (HON) The Financial Times reported in May that
Futter was expected to step down from the panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flynn, whose age was listed as 55 in a March news release,
led KPMG International from 2007 until he retired in October,
according to the bank. &#8220;He has extensive experience in
financial services and risk management from 32 years with KPMG
and its predecessors,&#8221; the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Susan M. Ciccarone, a managing
director in Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s financial institutions
group, has left the company after three years to become chief
financial officer at Emerging Global Advisors LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ciccarone, 39, started this week, according to Bill Fallon,
a spokesman for New York-based Emerging Global, who declined to
comment on who she replaced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The asset-management company, which advises the EGShares
family of exchange-traded funds, last year hired Marten S. Hoekstra as chief executive officer, replacing Robert C. Holderith, who founded the firm in 2008 and is now president.
Hoekstra, 51, was previously CEO of the Americas wealth-
management business at Zurich-based UBS AG (UBSN), where he worked for
26 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ciccarone joined New York-based Goldman Sachs in 2009,
after having worked at UBS since 2002, according to records
maintained by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. She
was promoted to managing director, the company&#8217;s second-highest
rank, in 2010. At Goldman Sachs, she specialized in advising
banks, including Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)&#8217;s $6.3 billion cash
purchase of Chrysler Financial Corp. from Cerberus Capital
Management LP, which was completed last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I am happy to join a firm that is leading the effort to
provide investors with tools for core emerging-market investment
allocations,&#8221; Ciccarone said in a statement provided by
Emerging Global. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, based in New York, is the fifth-biggest U.S.
bank by assets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marfrig Alimentos SA (MRFG3), Brazil&#8217;s
second-biggest food company, is attracting the interest of
Blackstone Group LP (BX) and Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN) for a plan to sell a
stake, three people with direct knowledge of the talks said.
Shares surged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private equity units of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Banco
Bradesco SA (BBDC4) are also interested in buying a shareholding in
Marfrig or one of its units, the people said, asking not to be
named because discussions are private. Marfrig hired Banco Itau
BBA SA to raise 2 billion reais ($990 million) through the
sales, they said, adding that talks are in a preliminary stage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marfrig, which makes TV dinners, chicken nuggets and hot
dogs, is seeking to reduce debt after making 20 acquisitions in
five years to compete with BRF - Brasil Foods SA. (BRFS3) In April, it
concluded the sale of European and U.S. assets to Illinois-based
Martin-Brower Co. for $400 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sao Paulo-based Marfrig declined to comment in an e-mailed
response to questions. Joao Sampaio, Marfrig&#8217;s vice president of
institutional affairs, said June 13 that the company was seeking
to sell assets, including a stake in its Seara unit, to reduce
debt to as low as 2.5 times earnings from 4.5 times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Rose, a New York-based spokesman for private-equity
firm Blackstone, declined to comment. Officials at Itau,
Bradesco and JPMorgan&#8217;s Gavea Investimentos Ltda., who all asked
not to be named because of company policies, also declined to
comment. Gary Mickelson, a spokesman at Tyson Foods, the biggest
U.S. meat processor, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shares Rise &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marfrig rose 3.2 percent to 10.38 reais at 11:55 a.m. in
Sao Paulo, the biggest gain on Brazil&#8217;s benchmark Bovespa index,
which was little changed. The stock climbed 18 percent this
year, raising its market value to 3.48 billion reais as of
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Marfrig is a well-managed company with good products; the
only thing that is stopping the stock from rising is debt,&#8221;
Caue Pinheiro, an analyst at brokerage SLW Corretora, said by
phone from Sao Paulo. &#8220;That&#8217;s why a plan to reduce its leverage
is welcome.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s Investors Service last week lowered Marfrig&#8217;s debt
ratings from B1 to B2, two levels below investment grade, citing
the &#8220;recent deterioration in its liquidity, mainly due to the
concentration of short-term debt payments in the second and
third quarters of 2012.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Credit Rating &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fitch Ratings Ltd. revised its outlook for Marfrig and Sao
Paulo-based rivals JBS SA (JBSS3) and Brasil Foods to negative from
stable. JBS is the world&#8217;s largest beef producer and Brasil
Foods is the biggest poultry exporter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Marfrig will be challenged to raise prices to fully
accommodate its rising costs in the context of a slow economy in
Brazil and slower-than-expected recovery in its export
markets,&#8221; Fitch said in an Aug. 17 statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marfrig spent $2 billion in 2010 to buy Seara from Cargill
Inc. and McDonald&#8217;s Corp. supplier Keystone Foods, causing debt
to quadruple in two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Itau BBA is the wholesale arm of Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4),
the biggest Latin American bank by market value. Bradesco is
Latin America&#8217;s second-largest lender by market value. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI), India&#8217;s largest
telephone company, picked eight banks including JPMorgan Chase 
Co. and Barclays Plc (BARC) to manage an initial share sale of its
towers unit, said two people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bharti Airtel, based in New Delhi, may sell shares in
Bharti Infratel Ltd. in the first quarter of 2013, the people
said, asking not to be identified as the details are
confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IPO could raise about $1 billion, the people said,
making it the largest in India since state-owned Coal India
Ltd. (COAL)&#8217;s $3.5 billion sale in October 2010. IPO fundraising in the
country has tumbled this year as the economy slowed, with just
$303 million of deals completed, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bharti, which had named Standard Chartered last year to
help it tap the markets, also mandated Bank of America Merrill
Lynch, Enam Securities Pvt., HSBC Holdings Plc, Kotak Mahindra
Capital Co. and UBS AG this week for the sale, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bharti Airtel in December 2007 agreed to sell a $1 billion
stake in the towers unit to investors including Temasek Holdings
Pte, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. Two months
later, Bharti Infratel said KKR  Co., the leveraged- buyout
firm led by Henry Kravis and George Roberts, agreed to invest
$250 million in a deal that valued the company at $12.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bharti Airtel spokesman Raza Khan declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lawsuit against a JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) unit over a $25 million bond-purchase contract was dropped
by the Peralta Community College District in Oakland,
California, which had claimed the bank would get a windfall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peralta sued JPMorgan Securities LLC Aug. 13 claiming the
bank was seeking to force it to make good on a 2006 contract
requiring it to issue high interest-rate bonds and sell them to
the bank, which would resell them at a profit of as much as $4
million, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peralta said the contract, which was originally with Bear
Stearn Cos., was illegal under a 2009 opinion by the California
Attorney General&#8217;s office that outlawed so-called cash-out bond
refundings. New York-based JPMorgan acquired Bear Stearns in
2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan agreed to terminate the contract in exchange for
Peralta refunding $550,000 that Bear Stearns had paid the
college in 2006 and dropping the lawsuit, according to an
agreement disclosed by Peralta&#8217;s general counsel&#8217;s office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school has until Sept. 4 to return the money, according
to the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thuy Thi Nguyen, Peralta&#8217;s general counsel, declined to
comment on the dismissal. Tasha Pelio, a spokeswoman for
JPMorgan, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mail yesterday
after regular business hours seeking comment on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Peralta Community College District v. JPMorgan
Securities LLC, RG12-643254, California Superior Court, Alameda
County (Oakland). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAMRQ) is appealing a bankruptcy
judge&#8217;s ruling in favor of Eastman Kodak Co. that blocked the
iPhone maker&#8217;s claims to two patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple said in a court filing Aug. 22 that it is challenging
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Allan Gropper&#8217;s decision that gave Kodak a
partial victory in a lawsuit over ownership of 10 patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assets are in a portfolio of patents that Kodak put up
for sale as part of its bankruptcy restructuring. The Rochester,
New York-based company sued Apple after the Cupertino,
California-based company asserted claims to the patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gropper ruled in favor of Kodak on two of the patents. The
judge denied the company&#8217;s request for a pretrial ruling known
as summary judgment on the eight others and said Kodak could
renew its request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Eastman Kodak Co. (EKDKQ) v. Apple Inc. (AAPL), 12-01720, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Microsoft Debuts New Logo Ahead of Windows 8, Surface Tablet &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) unveiled its first new logo in 25 years as
it prepares to introduce Windows 8, an updated version of its
flagship software that will power the company&#8217;s own Surface
tablet and other touch-screen devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logo uses the so-called Segoe font, which is used in
Microsoft products and marketing materials, and four colored
squares that are &#8220;intended to express the company&#8217;s diverse
portfolio of products,&#8221; the Redmond, Washington-based company
said on its blog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker, has revamped
products including Windows, phone software and the Xbox game
machine to adopt a sleeker, more modern-looking design to
compete with Apple Inc. for style-conscious consumers. The
colored squares in the new logo resemble the tiles found on
touch-screen phones and tablets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new logo is meant &#8220;to show that this isn&#8217;t your
father&#8217;s Microsoft, and there is something fresh, but also
familiar,&#8221; said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at market
research firm Gartner Inc. It also helps to show Windows and
Microsoft&#8217;s overall new design language, formerly known as
Metro, are &#8220;relevant and aspirational to the market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The redesign comes as consumers are increasingly choosing
the tablets over laptops, weakening personal-computer sales and
curbing Windows revenue. The company has said it plans to
release Windows 8 on Oct. 26 and the Surface with an ARM
Holdings Plc-based chip at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This wave of new releases is not only a reimagining of
our most popular products, but also represents a new era for
Microsoft, so our logo should evolve to visually accentuate this
new beginning,&#8221; Microsoft said on the blog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past several years, Microsoft has been trying to
forge a more unified look and feel for the company&#8217;s products
using a colorful, tile-based design first unveiled as part of
Windows Phone under the name Metro. Earlier this month,
Microsoft retired Metro, stating that it was used merely as a
code name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Humana Sues Human-Resources Management Company for Infringement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humana Inc. (HUM), the Louisville, Kentucky-based health insurer,
sued an Illinois-based company that manages human resources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humanalogic Inc. infringes trademarks held by the health
insurer, according to the complaint filed Aug. 22 in federal
court in Chicago. Humana said that as soon as it became aware of
Humanalogic in early 2012, it began sending a series of cease-
and-desist notices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humanalogic, of Rolling Meadows, Illinois, has failed to
respond to Humana&#8217;s requests, the company said in its court
papers. Humana said that its attempts to resolve the issue
&#8220;amicably and quickly&#8221; have been unsuccessful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Humanalogic name, Humana said it objects
to the company&#8217;s humanalogic.com Internet domain name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humana asked the court to bar further infringement and give
it the offending domain name. It also seeks the destruction of
all allegedly infringing material and awards of money damages,
litigation costs and attorney fees, plus extra damages intended
to punish Humanalogic for its actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humanalogic didn&#8217;t respond immediately to an e-mailed
request for comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Humana Inc. v. Humanalogic Inc., 12-cv-06842,
U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diageo&#8217;s &#8216;Stark Raving&#8217; Wines Infringe Mark, Winemaker Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A unit of Diageo Plc (DGE), the world&#8217;s largest distiller, was
sued for trademark infringement by a winemaker from California&#8217;s
Sonoma County. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian Stark, who established his Stark Wine LLC in
Healdsburg, California, in 2009, objects to Diageo Chateau 
Estate Wines&#8217; use of &#8220;Stark Raving&#8221; as a label for two of its
wines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint filed Aug. 20 in federal court
in San Francisco, Stark, a graduate of the California Culinary
Academy, makes small batches of premium varietal wines that sell
for $28 to $44 a bottle. He also produces wine under a second
label -- &#8220;Stark Thirst&#8221; -- that sells in the $16 range and is
aimed at a younger market, he said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;Stark Raving&#8221; wines, which are on the verge of
hitting the market, &#8220;appear to be high volume, mass produced
wines that will sell for less than $10 per bottle,&#8221; according
to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stark said he was met with a refusal when he sent Diageo a
cease-and-desist notice. He claims that the public will be
confused by the &#8220;Stark Raving&#8221; label and assume some
connection to his winery, and that he will be harmed as a
result. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He asked the court to bar Diageo&#8217;s use of &#8220;Stark Raving&#8221;
and for the seizure and destruction of all infringing products
and promotional materials. He also seeks a court order barring
the Commissioner of Trademarks at the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office from registering &#8220;Stark Raving&#8221; and &#8220;Stark Raving
Mad&#8221; marks for Diageo, and asked for awards of money damages,
litigation costs and attorney fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stark requested that the court order Diageo to take down
the Starkravingwines.com website and transfer the domain name to
him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diageo didn&#8217;t respond immediately to an e-mailed request
for comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Stark v. Diageo Chateau  Estate Wine Co., 12-
cv-04385, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
(San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wal-Mart Accused of Infringing Gift-Wrap Design Copyrights &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), the world&#8217;s largest retailer, was
sued for copyright infringement by a manufacturer of gift wrap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit, filed in federal court in Atlanta Aug. 21,
targets Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart and its supplier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart is selling gift wrap and gift items wrapped in
paper that infringed designs belonging to the U.K&#8217;s
International Greetings Plc (IGR)&#8217;s International Greetings USA unit,
according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The designs are used without license or permission, the
company claims. International Greetings alleged that Wal-Mart
realized gross revenue of at least $1.5 million from the sale of
the allegedly infringing products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company asked the court for awards of money damages and
litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart has &#8220;strict standards that all of our suppliers
must follow and we hold our suppliers accountable if there are
instances of copyright or other infringement,&#8221; Randy Hargrove,
a company spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. The company
is &#8220;looking into&#8221; the allegations, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is International Greetings USA Inc., v. Seminole
Consulting and Marketing Inc., 12-cv-02897, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of Georgia (Atlanta). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks fell, following the
first weekly decline in about two months for the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 Index, as investors awaited indications on whether
the Federal Reserve will provide further stimulus measures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard Co., Alcoa Inc. and Bank of America Corp.
dropped at least 1.1 percent to pace losses in the biggest
companies. Apple Inc., (AAPL) the most valuable company, climbed 1.9
percent after a jury found Samsung Electronics Co. infringed six
of seven patents for its mobile devices. Google Inc. (GOOG), which
offers the Android mobile software, declined 1.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 slid 0.1 percent to 1,410.44 at 4 p.m. New York
time. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 33.30 points, or 0.3
percent, to 13,124.67. The Nasdaq-100 Index gained 0.2 percent
to 2,782.55, after rising to the highest since 2000 during the
day. Volume for exchange-listed stocks in the U.S. was 4.5
billion shares, the lowest level since at least 2008 excluding
days surrounding holidays, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s no great conviction in either direction,&#8221; said
Richard Sichel, who oversees $1.6 billion as chief investment
officer at Philadelphia Trust Co. He spoke in a phone interview.
&#8220;There are a couple of bright spots, such as Apple. People are
looking ahead for Fed signals. I believe Bernanke&#8217;s speech will
probably be more of the same. It&#8217;s more likely that it will be a
continuation of what we&#8217;ve been hearing and less of an event.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke probably won&#8217;t use his Aug. 31
speech at the Fed&#8217;s annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming,
to suggest a third round of bond buying is at hand, according to
economists such as Michael Feroli at JPMorgan Chase  Co. and
James O&#8217;Sullivan at High Frequency Economics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Monthly Gain &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500, which last week failed to stay above a four-
year high, is still on pace for its third straight monthly gain
amid bets central banks will provide further economic stimulus.
The index has risen 2.3 percent so far in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodity, phone and industrial shares had the biggest
losses in the SP 500 among 10 groups. HP dropped 2.1 percent to
$17.21, the lowest since 2004. Alcoa slid 1.7 percent to $8.48.
Bank of America retreated 1.1 percent to $8.07. Technology
shares in the SP 500 rose 0.2 percent as a group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple gained 1.9 percent to a record $675.68. Victories in
patent disputes over phones using Google&#8217;s Android may extend,
rather than end, the litigation that&#8217;s lasted more than two
years and spanned four continents. The jury verdict won Aug. 24
against Samsung came shortly after a trade agency in Washington
cleared Apple of some claims by Google&#8217;s Motorola Mobility unit
that could have led to a U.S. ban on the iPhone and iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Steve Jobs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, the decisions embolden Apple to continue the
campaign envisioned by its late co-founder, Steve Jobs, to prove
phones running on Android copied the iPhone&#8217;s features and
designs. Apple won&#8217;t stop unless there&#8217;s a decisive blow against
it, and Samsung, with its reputation at stake, also has little
incentive to settle, said Tom Scott, a patent lawyer at Goodwin
Procter LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Most commercial disputes are on the merits of the case,&#8221;
said Scott, chairman of the firm&#8217;s intellectual property group
in Washington. &#8220;This is different. It&#8217;s a war. It&#8217;s an economic
war.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google dropped 1.4 percent to $669.22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best Buy Co. added 3.2 percent to $17.87. The world&#8217;s
largest electronics retailer and founder Richard Schulze reached
an agreement allowing him to conduct due diligence in his effort
to acquire the company a week after earlier talks failed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group Inc. (DTG) rallied 7.5 percent to
$87.08. Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (HTZ) struck a deal to buy the
company for about $2.6 billion in cash and secure its place as
the No. 2 player in the U.S. market. Hertz jumped 8.1 percent to
$14.21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hudson City &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hudson City Bancorp soared a record 16 percent to $7.45.
MT Bank Corp. (MTB), which counts Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. among its largest investors, agreed to buy the bank to
expand in New Jersey in a deal valued at about $3.7 billion.
Under terms of the agreement, each Hudson City shareholder will
receive 0.08403 of an MT share in the form of either MT stock
or cash. MT climbed 4.6 percent to $89.82. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenexa Inc. jumped 41 percent to $45.79. International
Business Machines Corp. (IBM) will spend about $1.3 billion for the
maker of Web-based human-resources and recruiting services, part
of its effort to reach $16 billion in annual analytics revenue.
IBM slipped 1.1 percent to $195.69. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiffany  Co. (TIF) climbed 7.2 percent to $62.71. The world&#8217;s
second-largest luxury jewelry retailer reported a drop in
worldwide comparable-store sales that was smaller than some
analysts projected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Buyback, Dividend &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AOL Inc. (AOL) gained 2.9 percent to $33.86 after announcing a
$600 million accelerated stock buyback agreement and a special
cash dividend of $5.15 a share, the final steps in returning
about $1.1 billion to shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ImmunoGen Inc. (IMGN) rose 5.6 percent to $14.62. Partner Roche
Holding AG said its experimental breast cancer drug
significantly extended the lives of patients when compared with
standard therapy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American stocks are dominating global equities by the most
in a decade, taking a majority of the spots in a ranking of the
20 biggest companies, after earnings rose faster than the rest
of the world as the global economy rebounded. Apple,
International Business Machines Corp., Wells Fargo  Co. and
four more U.S. companies joined the top 20 since stocks peaked
in 2007, bringing the total to 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They replaced Moscow-based Gazprom OAO, China Petroleum 
Chemical Corp. in Beijing, Petroleo Brasileiro SA of Rio de
Janeiro and six others from Europe and Asia. Of the nine added,
only BHP Billiton Ltd. and Nestle SA (NESN) are based outside the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;10 Quarters &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More U.S. corporations are represented than any time since
2003 after 10 quarters of economic expansion and profit growth
lifted the SP 500 109 percent since shares bottomed in March
2009. The shift reflects volatility in emerging markets and
shows how innovation builds value in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The U.S. is just the best place on the planet to have a
great idea and turn it into a big business,&#8221; according to
Michael Shaoul, chairman of New York-based Marketfield Asset
Management, which oversees $2.7 billion. &#8220;There&#8217;s another
reason for this list to have shifted and that is the falling of
prior darlings,&#8221; said Shaoul, whose fund beat 99 percent of
competitors in the past year. &#8220;A lot of the ones which have
fallen are energy and emerging-market related.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), both looking to increase U.S. sales of smartphones, stand to get a much-needed boost as Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) products face a possible ban and handset makers come under pressure to consider alternatives to Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Android software. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A federal jury awarded Apple Inc. (AAPL) more than $1 billion on Aug. 24, saying Samsung infringed on six of seven patents for mobile devices. U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh will weigh Apple&#8217;s request for a ban on U.S. sales of some devices from Samsung, the dominant maker of Android phones, next month. Some Android- equipment makers may turn to platforms such as Microsoft&#8217;s Windows 8 to avoid a similar trip to court, said Carolina Milanesi of the research firm Gartner Inc. (IT) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related Stories:&lt;/p&gt;
Verdict May Lead to Samsung Sales Ban
Jury May Have Leaned on Engineer, Patent Holder
Decision May Spur Wider Range of Smartphones
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I am sure that vendors in the Android ecosystem are wondering how long it will be before they become Apple&#8217;s target,&#8221; Milanesi said in an interview. &#8220;This might sway some vendors to look at Windows Phone 8 as an alternative, and for the ones like HTC Corp. (2498) and even Samsung, who have already announced plans to bring to market a WP8 device, how much stronger their investment should be.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ruling will allow Apple to defend its intellectual property more vigorously, Bloomberg Industries analyst John Butler said in a report. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Microsoft Benefits &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nokia, based in Espoo, Finland, rose 7.7 percent to close at 2.68 euros in Helsinki. The stock is down 29 percent this year. Microsoft climbed less than 1 percent to $30.69 in New York. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Samsung, which had risen 21 percent this year before the U.S. court ruling, fell 7.5 percent in Seoul, the biggest decline since October 2008. Apple climbed 1.9 percent to $675.68. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;BlackBerry maker Research in Motion Ltd. gained 1.9 percent to $7.07 in New York, the first rise after falling for ten consecutive sessions. RIM will largely miss an opportunity to benefit because the first of the new BlackBerry 10 phones it&#8217;s counting on to win sales won&#8217;t arrive until next year&#8217;s first quarter, said Horace Dediu, a former analyst for Nokia who now runs mobile-phone industry research firm Asymco.com in Helsinki. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft stands to gain the most, Dediu said. The Redmond, Washington-based company has already prevailed in patent disputes with Android user Motorola Mobility, which is owned by Google. Microsoft has won orders that banned U.S. imports of some Motorola devices and limits on sales of some of the company&#8217;s products in Germany. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Android Costs &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft can go in to all these accounts and say, &#8216;Let us remind you again of the cost of Android,&#8217;&#8221; Dediu said. &#8220;What Microsoft has always had trouble with is getting these vendors to switch.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Samsung sells dozens of Android phone models, according to its website, compared with three for Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft could also boast it offers legal protection that Google, by giving away Android for free to vendors, hasn&#8217;t provided, Dediu said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;With Windows phones, you&#8217;re protected against IP lawsuits because, if anybody sues, they are going to talk with Microsoft,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Microsoft can do that because they actually do have their IP pretty well sorted out.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nokia decided to become partners with Microsoft last year after jettisoning its aging Symbian platform that had failed to keep up with Apple&#8217;s iPhone and Android devices. Nokia&#8217;s global mobile-phone market share slumped to 20 percent last quarter from 23 percent a year earlier, according to Gartner. Android&#8217;s share among platforms rose 21 percentage points to 64 percent, while Cupertino, California-based Apple&#8217;s iOS had 19 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Getting Traction &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Right now, for Nokia, it is a case of &#8216;the more the merrier,&#8217; as the strength of the ecosystem is what they need to get traction with consumers and carriers alike,&#8221; said Milanesi, of Stamford, Connecticut-based Gartner. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More important than the Aug. 24 U.S. court ruling is the injunction Judge Koh is considering issuing next month, said Mark Lemley, a professor at Stanford Law School in Stanford, California. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The real question is whether this is enough to derail the momentum the Android ecosystem has gained in the marketplace,&#8221; Lemley said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many of the infringement claims don&#8217;t have anything to do with the Android software, Google said yesterday in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a court filing today, Apple sought a ban on eight models of Samsung&#8217;s smartphones, including several of its Galaxy S devices. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Lumia Phones &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Most of these don&#8217;t relate to the core Android operating system, and several are being re-examined by the U.S. Patent Office,&#8221; Google said in its statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The injunction may give other handset makers a welcome boost, said Michael Schroeder, a Helsinki-based analyst at FIM Bank. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;A potential sales ban on Samsung products will create some additional room for Nokia as it is preparing to ship the new lineup of Lumia devices over the next couple of months,&#8221; Schroeder said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nokia continues to focus on expanding the entire Windows Phone system, said Susan Sheehan, a spokeswoman. She declined to comment on the Samsung ruling. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last quarter Nokia sold 600,000 handsets in North America, little changed from the previous period even after introducing the flagship Lumia 900 in April at ATT Inc. Apple sold 5.9 million iPhones, which then-CEO Steve Jobs introduced in 2007, in the U.S. in the quarter, according to Strategy Analytics. Microsoft&#8217;s mobile platform gained speed, winning 2.7 percent of global sales compared with 1.6 percent a year earlier, Gartner said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Elop&#8217;s Bet &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nokia is set to show its new Lumia smartphones running Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Phone 8 software on Sept. 5. Stephen Elop, the former Microsoft executive who was brought aboard in 2010 to revive Nokia, is now betting that a wave of advertising spending by Microsoft to push the new Windows 8 operating system will help accelerate demand for Lumia. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tara Walberg of New York-based public relations firm Waggener Edstrom Worldwide, speaking on behalf of Microsoft, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While RIM is fighting a similar battle to regain lost market share with a new platform, it is months behind Nokia. RIM&#8217;s take of global smartphone platforms fell to 5.2 percent last quarter from 12 percent a year earlier. The first two new models of BlackBerry 10 devices -- a touchscreen and a traditional Qwerty keyboard version -- won&#8217;t be out until early next year, well after the iPhone 5, expected out next month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;RIM&#8217;s Battle &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;RIM&#8217;s sales fell 43 percent last quarter as its aging lineup of devices failed to excite buyers. Chief Executive Officer Thorsten Heins said earlier this month that the new BlackBerry 10 platform will soon be ready to license to other manufacturers, even as his company races to release its own handsets with the software early next year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Waterloo, Ontario-based RIM has no comment on the case, said Amy Jones, a company spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Asymco&#8217;s Dediu said RIM doesn&#8217;t stand to benefit in the same way because it won&#8217;t have a new competitive product until next year. RIM&#8217;s stock has fallen 76 percent in the past 12 months and is 95 percent off its 2008 high. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;RIM is not competitive,&#8221; Dediu said. &#8220;RIM&#8217;s story will be more next year if they are able to recover.&#8217; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lasting damage may ultimately be to Samsung, not Google, because the judge ruled the infringements had less to do with the Android operating system and were more related to imitating the iPhone&#8217;s design, said Edward Snyder, an analyst at Charter Equity Research (MFSEEA1) in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;Apparently, they lifted too much of the look and feel from iPhone, but I don&#8217;t believe it has much to do with the Android OS, and even if it did, I doubt Google would have much trouble designing around it,&#8221; Snyder said. &#8220;We&#8217;re unlikely to see a big push to Windows because of this.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Sarah Frier" date="Aug 27, 2012  4:15 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-27/ibm-to-buy-social-business-company-kenexa-for-about-1-3-billion.html"><headline>IBM to Buy Social-Business Company Kenexa for $1.3 Billion</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) agreed to buy Kenexa Corp. (KNXA) for about $1.3 billion in cash,
adding social-networking services that help companies handle
human resources and recruiting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM will pay $46 a share for the Wayne, Pennsylvania-based
company, a 42 percent premium over the stock&#8217;s closing price on
Aug. 24. The deal is expected to be completed in the fourth
quarter, IBM said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchase bolsters IBM&#8217;s business-analytics software,
which helps companies cull vast amounts of data to make
decisions and study trends. Kenexa works with more than 8,900
customers, including Starbucks Corp., General Electric Co. and
Boeing Co. Armonk, New York-based IBM has spent $16 billion on
30 analytics acquisitions in the past five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This ties very directly into the investments we&#8217;ve made
in helping clients create enterprise social networks and how we
apply analytics,&#8221; Alistair Rennie, IBM&#8217;s general manager of
social business, said in an interview. &#8220;This idea of how you
leverage talent and bring it forward has become a significant
operational issue.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM will focus on analysis of the communication patterns
using Kenexa&#8217;s systems, Rennie said. The company has been moving
into software and analytics for income growth as hardware and
services become less profitable. Kenexa&#8217;s software helps
companies recruit new workers, communicate with employees about
goals and develop succession plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rival Acquisitions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acquisition follows deals by IBM&#8217;s competitors for
human-resources software makers, including SAP AG (SAP)&#8217;s agreement in
December to purchase SuccessFactors Inc. for $3.4 billion and
Oracle Corp. (ORCL)&#8217;s $1.9 billion takeover of Taleo Corp., announced
in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenexa is unlikely to get a rival bid because of the price
IBM is paying and because there probably won&#8217;t be regulatory
delays, Bryan Schwartz, an analyst with Oppenheimer  Co. in New
York, said in a note to investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenexa shares jumped 41 percent to $45.79 at the close in
New York. They have climbed 71 percent in 2012. IBM, up 6.4
percent this year, fell 1 percent today to $195.69. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $1.3 billion purchase price excludes Kenexa&#8217;s cash on
hand. The company had about $90 million in cash and short-term
investments at the end of the second quarter. IBM is aiming to
generate $16 billion from business analytics by 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lazard Ltd. served as Kenexa&#8217;s financial adviser, while
Pepper Hamilton LLP was its legal adviser. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HSH Nordbank AG, a German regional
lender bailed out during the financial crisis, sued Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) over more than $634 million
in residential mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSH Nordbank accused Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, both
based in New York, of making &#8220;material misrepresentations and
omissions&#8221; about the underwriting standards used to issue
mortgage loans that were pooled together into the securities,
according to documents filed Aug. 24 in New York State Supreme
Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs declined to comment on the lawsuit, Tiffany Galvin, a company spokeswoman, said in a telephone interview.
Lauren Onis, a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley, declined to
comment on the lawsuit immediately in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSH Nordbank sued Goldman Sachs over $110 million in
mortgage securities and Morgan Stanley over $524 million of the
investments, according court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
biggest recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
and the crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the
market for the securities evaporated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSH Nordbank, based in Hamburg, is one of a group of
regional German lenders sued in state court in Manhattan over
mortgage-backed securities during the past year. Other banks
sued by HSH Nordbank include UBS AG and Barclays Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new cases are HSH Nordbank AG v. Morgan Stanley,
652988/2012, and HSH Nordbank AG v. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
652991/2012, New York State Supreme Court, New York County,
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) researchers spent four years developing Watson, the computer smart enough to beat the champions of the quiz show &#8220;Jeopardy!&#8221; Now they&#8217;re trying to figure out how to get those capabilities into the phone in your pocket. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bernie Meyerson, IBM&#8217;s vice president of innovation, envisions a voice-activated Watson that answers questions, like a supercharged version of Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s Siri personal assistant. A farmer could stand in a field and ask his phone, &#8220;When should I plant my corn?&#8221; He would get a reply in seconds, based on location data, historical trends and scientific studies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finding additional uses for Watson is part of IBM&#8217;s plan to tap new markets and boost revenue from business analytics to $16 billion by 2015. After mastering history and pop culture for its &#8220;Jeopardy!&#8221; appearance, the system is crunching financial information for Citigroup Inc. and cancer data for WellPoint Inc. The next version, dubbed &#8220;Watson 2.0,&#8221; would be energy- efficient enough to work on smartphones and tablets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The power it takes to make Watson work is dropping down like a stone,&#8221; Meyerson said in an interview. &#8220;One day, you will have ready access to an incredible engine with a world knowledge base.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM expects to generate billions in sales by putting Watson to work in finance, health care, telecommunications and other areas. The computer, which 15 million people saw beat former &#8220;Jeopardy!&#8221; champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter, is the company&#8217;s most high-profile product since it sold its personal- computer unit to Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) seven years ago. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Voice Recognition &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The challenge for IBM is overcoming the technical obstacles to making Watson a handheld product, and figuring out how to price and deliver it. Watson&#8217;s nerve center is 10 racks of IBM Power750 servers running in Yorktown Heights, New York, that have the same processing power as 6,000 desktop computers. Even though most of the computations occur at the data center, a Watson smartphone application would still consume too much power for it to be practical today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another hurdle: It takes a while for Watson to do the &#8220;machine learning&#8221; necessary to become a reliable assistant in an area. Watson&#8217;s deal with WellPoint (WLP) was announced in September of last year, and the system won&#8217;t master the field of oncology until at least late 2013. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Adding &#8216;Senses&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers also need to add voice and image recognition to the service so that it can respond to real-world input, said Katharine Frase, vice president of industry research at Armonk, New York-based IBM. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;In 2.0, we hope to give him more senses,&#8221; Frase said. &#8220;A guy could say into his phone, &#8216;Here&#8217;s where I am and here&#8217;s what I see,&#8217; lifting it up to take in images of the environment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s path to the mobile-assistant market contrasts with Apple&#8217;s. For one, IBM is focused on corporate customers, while Apple is targeting anyone who buys its phones. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple made Siri the focus of its marketing of the iPhone 4S, which debuted last year. The software is touted as a personal assistant that can answer a wide range of spoken questions -- &#8220;Do I need an umbrella tomorrow?&#8221; -- and put appointments in a calendar. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Siri has become a defining characteristic of the iPhone, though it&#8217;s also drawn complaints. In a June survey by Minneapolis-based Piper Jaffray  Co., Siri was found to resolve requests correctly less than 70 percent of the time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Enhancing Siri &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Trudy Muller, a spokeswoman for Cupertino, California-based Apple, said customers are happy with Siri and the company will further improve the software in the next version of the iOS operating system. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Siri is one of the most popular features of iPhone 4S,&#8221; she said. &#8220;With new features coming this fall in iOS 6, Siri will help you get even more done with just your voice.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With Watson, IBM aims to tackle more complex questions. The program will be able to understand oncology well enough to advise doctors on diagnosis and prescriptions, said Martin Kohn, IBM&#8217;s chief medical scientist. One iPad application for Watson -- a health-care program developed with a Columbia University professor -- is being used to demonstrate its medical capabilities for prospective IBM customers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the technology is improved, a mobile Watson could  become an extension of services that IBM already offers to  business customers such as WellPoint, the second-biggest U.S. health insurer. The move fits into a broader push to promote analytics software, which helps customers diagnose problems and spot patterns in everything from infant mortality to South American floods. IBM agreed to buy Kenexa Corp. for about  $1.3 billion yesterday as part of the effort. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Studying Symptoms &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In one potential scenario, a patient accesses Watson via a mobile device to explain symptoms in natural language. The person then gets several recommendations for what might be happening, listed in order of the computer&#8217;s confidence. The patient and a doctor both have access to Watson, which would securely access the patient&#8217;s medical records, letting it make adjustments to an answer depending on factors like pregnancy or diabetes, Kohn said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For now, the features are being developed for care providers, not patients themselves, and the program is still in the testing stage. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s going to come a point where you don&#8217;t need any intermediary,&#8221; Meyerson said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Learning Subjects &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;To &#8220;teach&#8221; Watson a subject such as oncology, researchers feed the machine with answers to relevant questions. They then ask it to answer similar queries by analyzing documents, websites and books at 66 million pages a second. After enough times telling the machine which answers are accurate, Watson can develop expertise to assist a doctor. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s going to recommend to you the answer and show you the evidence,&#8221; Frase said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Adding voice recognition and other senses to Watson might be easier than adding knowledge because IBM already makes tools that understand images and natural language, Kohn said. An IBM project for the U.S. military, for example, translated English into local dialects of Arabic. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Watson itself will not interpret images, but IBM has technology that does interpret images and numerical information,&#8221; Kohn said. &#8220;Watson 2.0 is all of these different tools, working together.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Sarah Frier" date="Aug 28, 2012 11:15 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-28/ibm-bets-1-billion-on-new-mainframe-in-shrinking-market.html"><headline>IBM Bets $1 Billion on New Mainframe in Shrinking Market</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) spent more than $1 billion over four years to develop a new mainframe computer, betting it can keep up with businesses shifting to cloud-based software and storage. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Armonk, New York-based company is unveiling the zEnterprise EC12 mainframe server today, the latest iteration of a 48-year-old product. It&#8217;s the outcome of more than $1 billion in research and development around the world to make the fastest and most secure IBM mainframe yet, said Rod Adkins, senior vice president of systems and technology. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even as IBM shifts its focus to more profitable businesses such as software, &#8220;the mainframe is central in that strategy,&#8221; Adkins said in an interview. &#8220;When you think about how our business model over time will continue to drive more from software and services, you still have to have the foundation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Revenue in IBM&#8217;s System Z mainframe line fell 17 percent in the first half from a year earlier, contributing to a decline in the $8 billion systems and technology business, according to a regulatory filing. The company won&#8217;t offer financial forecasts for how the new product will perform, Adkins said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Large enterprises such as banks, retailers and government agencies buy mainframes to support their data systems. IBM&#8217;s EC12, the first update since 2010, has 50 percent more capacity than its predecessor and runs at 5.5 gigahertz, the fastest in the industry, Adkins said. It&#8217;s also designed with built-in security software and support for private cloud environments, meaning a business can run thousands of systems on one mainframe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Royal Dutch
Shell Plc&#8217;s (RDSA) jet-fuel price increases in Argentina are being
challenged by the government at the Supreme Court, newspaper BAE
reported, citing an unnamed official at the country&#8217;s antitrust
agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government is appealing a lower-court ruling granted to
the local units of the two companies last week, which allowed
them to raise prices, the Buenos Aires-based newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Susanne Walker" date="Aug 28, 2012  9:56 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-28/treasuries-investors-increase-bullish-bets-jpmorgan-says.html"><headline>Treasuries Investors Increase Bullish Bets, JPMorgan Says</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Investors in Treasuries increased
bets that the prices of the securities will rise, making the
survey the most bullish since October, according to a survey by
JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proportion of net longs increased to 17 percentage
points in the week ending yesterday, equaling net longs on Oct.
31, according to JPMorgan. The figure is up from 10 percentage
points in the previous week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The percent of outright longs rose to 21 percent, the most
since July 23, up from 19 percent the previous week, the survey
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The percent of outright shorts, or bets the securities will
fall in value, dropped to 4 percent from 9 percent, pushing it
to the lowest level since September, the survey reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors raised neutral bets to 75 percent, from 72
percent, the survey reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year note dropped two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.64 percent at 9:54
a.m. in New York. The yield dropped 12 basis points last week.
It touched a record low of 1.379 percent on July 25 and reached
a 2012 high of 2.4 percent on March 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan doesn&#8217;t disclose the number of clients in the

&lt;p&gt;TengizChevroil LLP, the Kazakh oil
venture led by Chevron Corp. (CVX), cut oil output 3.8 percent in the
first half from a year earlier as it carried out maintenance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude output fell to 12.5 million metric tons, or 100
million barrels, from 13 million tons, or 104 million barrels,
in the first half of last year, the venture said in a statement
published on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TengizChevroil plans to produce 25 million tons of oil in
2012, a decline of about 3 percent from last year because of
capital repairs at the Caspian Sea project, the Interfax news
service said today, citing General Director Tim Miller in
Almaty, Kazakhstan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tengiz is the Central Asian country&#8217;s biggest producing
field. The Kazakh venture plans to spend $5 billion to $6
billion drilling in the next five years to sustain output.
TengizChevroil will invest $1 billion of that amount on three to
four wells this year, Miller said on Feb. 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TengizChevroil produced 25.8 million metric tons of crude
last year, or almost 565,000 barrels a day, a decline of about
0.4 percent from 2010, according to the Kazakh venture&#8217;s
website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, holds 50 percent
of the TengizChevroil venture, while Exxon Mobil Corp. owns 25
percent, state-controlled KazMunaiGaz National Corp. has 20
percent, and OAO Lukoil has 5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The venture exports oil via the Caspian Pipeline Consortium
to the Russian port of Novorossiysk on the Black Sea, and via
the Batumi and Kulevi ports in Georgia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Apache Corp. (APA)
will hold talks with YPF SA (YPFD) next month as the Argentine company
nationalized in April seeks partners to step up shale oil
development, said a YPF official briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YPF Chief Executive Officer Miguel Galuccio will meet with
Exxon and Apache executives during a conference in Houston on
Sept. 18-21, said the official, who asked not to be named,
citing company policy. Exxon, which is already exploring for
unconventional oil and natural gas with YPF in Argentina,
doesn&#8217;t comment on private meetings, said Patrick McGinn, an
Exxon spokesman. John Roper, an Apache spokesman, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galuccio, who met with Chevron Corp. (CVX) executives in Buenos
Aires on Aug. 24, is scheduled to unveil today a model for three
types of partnerships to tap the Vaca Muerta shale formation, a
Connecticut-size area in southern Argentina that contains at
least 23 billion barrels. Contracts will be for financial and
strategic partners and operators, Galuccio said Aug. 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;September will be the month in which YPF will show its
capacity to attract investors,&#8221; Francisco Perez, the governor
of Mendoza province, said in an interview in Buenos Aires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perez and Neuquen Governor Jorge Sapag said they will
accompany Galuccio to Houston. The two provinces own YPF shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chief executive, appointed after President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner seized control of YPF from Spain&#8217;s Repsol
SA in April, may also travel to China later next month to meet
with representatives of CNOOC Ltd. (883) and China Petroleum 
Chemical Corp. (600028), the YPF official said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Fraught with Peril&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galuccio described Vaca Muerta earlier this month as the
&#8220;tip of the iceberg&#8221; for YPF&#8217;s projects. The company, based in
Buenos Aires, has drilled 45 wells at the shale development.
Fernandez seized YPF on the grounds that Madrid-based Repsol
under-invested since it acquired the company in 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YPF, Argentina&#8217;s biggest energy company, approved this
month the sale of as much as 5 billion pesos ($758 million) of
bonds. The company is seeking funds to invest $7 billion in 2013
as it plans to double exploration in five years and boost
refining, Galuccio said June 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galuccio is scheduled to disclose at 12 p.m. Buenos Aires
time his proposals for attracting investors to develop Vaca
Muerta as part of a more than 1,000-page business plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaca Muerta is often considered to have &#8220;the greatest
potential as an oil shale outside of North America,&#8221; Roger Plank, chief corporate officer at Houston-based Apache, said at
an Aug. 15 energy conference. Having operations in Argentina
makes sense even as the country is &#8220;fraught with peril,&#8221; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonds of Arch Coal Inc. (ACI) dropped
after JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) analysts lowered their recommendation
on the miner&#8217;s debt to neutral from overweight, as expected
prices for metallurgical coal have dipped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arch&#8217;s $1 billion of 7.25 percent notes due June 2021
dropped 3.7 cents to 91 cents, the biggest decline since they
were issued in May, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The yield
climbed to 8.74 percent from 8.11 percent. The company&#8217;s $1
billion of 7 percent notes due June 2019 dropped 0.75 cent to
91.75 cents on the dollar, the biggest decline in three weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan lowered its opinion on the bonds after the 7.25
percent notes increased 14 cents since July 26 to 94.7 cents on
the dollar yesterday, analyst Dave Katz wrote in a note to
investors today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analyst&#8217;s recommendation reflects a decline in prices
for metallurgical coal, which is used to make products such as
steel. Spot prices for hard coking coal at $164 per tonne are
down from benchmark contract prices for the third quarter of
2012 of $225 per tonne, Katz wrote. While prices of thermal coal
used for heating have climbed, the price is unlikely to increase
further after a 15 percent drop in natural gas prices since July
to $2.72 per million British thermal units, Katz wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katz said he expects Arch Coal&#8217;s earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization to decline from $615
million to $360 million if coking coal prices remain at about
$180 per tonne for 2013. Arch will perform better than other
producers more dependent on metallurgical, or met, coal, such as
Bristol, Virginia-based Alpha Natural (ANR) Inc. Met coal accounts for
20 percent of Alpha&#8217;s volume and 5 percent of Arch&#8217;s, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-yield, high-risk debt is rated below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service and lower than BBB- at Standard  Poor&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), whose Wyeth unit
reserved more than $21 billion to settle lawsuits over the fen-
phen diet drugs, lost its bid to have claims that the pills
caused a fatal disease years after users stopped taking them
thrown out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Harvey Bartle III in Philadelphia today
rejected Pfizer&#8217;s arguments that there was no reliable evidence
that fen-phen could cause an often-fatal lung disease to arise
years after a user stopped taking the pills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts hired by plaintiffs to review their cases can
&#8220;properly rely on&#8221; studies and case reports showing primary
pulmonary hypertension, known as PPH, can be caused by diet-drug
combination more than 10 years after the last use of the
appetite suppressant, Bartle said in a 22-page ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s challenge to plaintiffs&#8217; PPH latency argument was
an attempt to wipe out the last significant litigation tied to
the diet-drug combination&#8217;s 1997 recall, Alex MacDonald, a
Boston-based plaintiffs&#8217; lawyer who has litigated cases over the
pills for more than a decade, said this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Today&#8217;s decision is a total victory for plaintiffs, who
only sought to keep the courthouse doors open so they could have
juries hear how their loved ones died of a horrible disease
because they took prescription diet drugs years ago,&#8221; MacDonald
said in a telephone interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Weighing Options&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said in an e-mailed
statement today that the company was disappointed with Bartle&#8217;s
ruling and was &#8220;weighing its legal options.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, acquired Wyeth in a
$68 billion buyout in 2009. It also acquired a $21.1 billion
liability for the fen-phen cases, many of which had been
consolidated in federal court in Philadelphia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 6 million prescriptions were written for the diet
combination before it was withdrawn. Consumers took Wyeth&#8217;s
Pondimin or Redux drugs as well as the generic Phentermine to
help suppress their appetites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyeth once faced more than 175,000 claims over the diet
combination. Former users accused the drugmaker of hiding its
health risks to generate billions in profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyeth officials sought to resolve the litigation by setting
up a $3.75 billion national settlement program for former users
in 2000. Costs of settlements forced the drugmaker to add $1.3
billion to the fund in 2004. Wyeth eventually boosted reserves
to more than $21 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PPH Verdicts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the number of PPH cases Wyeth has faced has been
relatively small, claims over the fatal lung disease have
generated verdicts and settlements for tens of millions of
dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A state-court jury in Beaumont, Texas, ordered Wyeth in
April 2004 to pay more than $1 billion to the family of a former
fen-phen user who died from PPH. The panel awarded Cynthia
Cappel-Coffey&#8217;s family $113 million in compensatory damages and
$900 million in punitive damages over the company&#8217;s mishandling
of the combination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker&#8217;s lawyers filed their PPH latency challenge
this year as two new cases were set for trial in the federal and
state courts in Philadelphia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyeth&#8217;s attorneys argued Jamie Cheek and Valarie Farmer
couldn&#8217;t prove their PPH cases were caused by their diet-drug
use in the 1990s. Cheek&#8217;s symptoms didn&#8217;t appear for nine years
after her last use of the drug, and Farmer&#8217;s became evident 11
years after she stopped taking it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Philadelphia Suits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheek&#8217;s case is filed in federal court in Philadelphia and
among the cases consolidated before Bartle while Farmer&#8217;s suit
is pending in state court in the same city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The women&#8217;s lawyers countered there are a wealth of studies
and case reports to back up the idea that PPH can have a latency
period of a decade or more and that respected medical
researchers have linked the disease to diet-drug use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Bartle found that plaintiffs&#8217; experts properly relied
on those studies and case reports to argue that their diet-drug
use caused them to develop PPH, it will be up to a jury to make
the final determination of that issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling expressed &#8220;no view on whether Ms. Cheek&#8217;s
ingestion of diet drugs caused her PPH when her symptoms did not
appear until eleven years after she stopped taking those
drugs,&#8221; Bartle wrote. &#8220;That is a matter for the jury to decide
after hearing from the experts on both sides and considering all
other relevant evidence.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are In re Diet Drugs Products Liability
Litigation, MDL No. 1203, and Brown v. American Home Products
Corp., 99-cv-20593, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Pennsylvania (Philadelphia). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA) are seeking bigger stakes and operating control in the
Kashagan oil field before starting to expand the $46 billion
project, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon and Shell have warned they may quit the project
unless they gain more control in the venture and Kazakhstan&#8217;s
government agrees to extend the production-sharing contract for
20 years, the people said, declining to be identified as the
talks are confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kashagan project in the Caspian Sea, touted as the
world&#8217;s biggest discovery in four decades when found, is slated
to reach commercial oil output no later than June 2013. The
Kashagan partners, which also include Eni SpA (ENI) and Total SA (FP), want
the second phase to widen the project&#8217;s profit margin after
costs for the first phase ballooned from early estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon and Shell may seek to buy out ConocoPhillips (COP)&#8217;s 8.4
percent stake in Kashagan, the two people said. ConocoPhillips
plans to sell $8 billion to $10 billion of assets by the middle
of 2013 and has said Kashagan may not offer a long-term,
strategic opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Leave Kashagan &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon and Shell will consider leaving the project if they
don&#8217;t reach an agreement on prolonging the Kashagan contract and
on operatorship, the two people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Exxon Mobil is a long-term investor in Kazakhstan and
plans to remain a major investor in the country,&#8221; Charlie Engelmann, a spokesman for the Irving, Texas-based oil company,
said by e-mail, declining to comment further. Ross Whittam, a
London-based spokesman for Shell, declined to comment, as did an
Eni press officer who declined to be identified, citing company
policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China National Petroleum Corp., seeking to enter Kashagan,
has engaged Citic Resources Holdings Ltd. (1205) to hold talks with the
partners that may want to divest, Energy Intelligence Group
said, citing unidentified people. Citic would then sell the
stake on to state-owned CNPC, the newsletter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With cost overruns and multiple delays over the past
decade, the international partners agreed in 2008 to cut their
stakes in Kashagan, boosting KazMunaiGaz&#8217;s interest to 16.8
percent. That is equal to the holdings of Exxon, Shell, Total
and Eni. Japan&#8217;s Inpex Corp. (1605) is also a partner with 7.56
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kashagan Operator &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The budget for the first phase is set to reach $46 billion
by the time the first oil is exported, a person with knowledge
of the matter said in January. An early cost estimate put the
tab at about $24 billion. While output is scheduled to start at
the end of the year, the project will reach commercial output no
later than June 2013, said Lyazzat Kiinov, head of state-run
KazMunaiGaz National Co., said in December, when he was deputy
oil minister. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, Eni ceded operatorship of Kashagan to North
Caspian Operating Co., an umbrella for the partners, each of
which is responsible for specific tasks while jointly making
decisions on the development. NCOC put Eni in charge of delivery
of Kashagan&#8217;s first phase, with Shell responsible for developing
offshore facilities in the second phase, and Exxon overseeing
drilling, according to venture&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kazakhstan&#8217;s biggest oilfield will produce 370,000 to
450,000 barrels of oil a day in the first phase, an amount that
may double in the second phase in 2018 or 2019, the government
said last year. The Oil Ministry oversees the Kashagan
production-sharing agreement, which allows the investors to
recoup costs before the government takes its share of oil
revenue. The agreement runs to 2041, according Eni&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With pitched baseballs and idled
rail cars, companies such as Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), CSX Corp. (CSX) and ATT
Inc. (T) this week put their names, representatives and issues in
front of the elected officials, senior aides and delegates
attending the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Microsoft and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) helped raise
$20,000 for area youth programs as delegates and lobbyists hit,
threw and fielded baseballs in the domed stadium where the Tampa
Bay Rays compete in the American League. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to nominating former Massachusetts Governor
Mitt Romney for president, the quadrennial gathering has offered
a chance for company representatives and lobbyists to gain
unusual access to public officials in an array of settings,
ranging from recreational to private hotel and restaurant spots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s almost like a flea market for political favors with
all kinds of politicians there, all kinds of lobbyists and all
kinds of special interests,&#8221; said Bill Allison, editorial
director of the Sunlight Foundation, a Washington-based watchdog
group that&#8217;s tracking the interaction between lobbyists and
delegates. &#8220;You only have once every four years that many
people with power and that many people who want to use that
power.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Republican convention closes tonight, the same
traveling band of trade groups and corporate representatives
will regroup next week in Charlotte, North Carolina, where the
Democrats will nominate President Barack Obama for re-election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Outfitted Locomotives &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representative Mary Bono Mack, a California Republican,
said it&#8217;s normal for people to get together at a convention.
&#8220;When you have 50,000 Republicans together, it&#8217;s a great place
to capitalize on that enthusiasm and interest,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSX, headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, used two
classic locomotives outfitted in the company&#8217;s blue-and-yellow
color scheme to create a rail village for hosting receptions for
convention delegates -- including elected officials who oversee
the railroad industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A green carpeted platform provides access to air
conditioned cars filled with food and drink -- including CSX-
branded bottle water. One of the cars had a large rear platform
that was used to accommodate President Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#8217;s wheelchair; the vehicle later served as part of the
funeral train for slain Senator Robert F. Kennedy, who was shot
during the 1968 Democratic presidential primary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Political Dialogue&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSX, the largest eastern U.S. railroad, spent $1.9 million
to lobby the federal government in the first six months of 2012
on issues such as renewing funding for surface transportation,
Amtrak, and environmental regulations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s important to be part of the political dialogue,&#8221;
said Gary Sease, a company spokesman. &#8220;This is an opportunity
to talk about the benefits of rail with the people who will
determine our future.&#8221; It&#8217;s also a chance to tout its home
state, Sease said. &#8220;Tampa is an important business place for
us,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We really wanted to help.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to setting up the rail village, CSX joined
other railroads, the construction industry, and the airline and
bus trade associations to hold a reception for members of the
House and Senate committees that oversee the transportation
industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Co-sponsoring an event like this provides us with an
excellent opportunity to explain the challenges facing
construction employers across the country and to help educate
convention delegates, elected officials and candidates about the
need for putting in place common-sense, pro-growth tax,
regulatory and infrastructure measures,&#8221; said Brian Turmail, a
spokesman for Arlington, Virginia-based Associated General
Contractors of America, one of the trade association sponsors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Play Ball &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg yesterday, signs
on the floor and electronic logos on the scoreboard advertised
the companies and trade groups that paid as much as $50,000 to
sponsor a day at the ballpark, a charitable event held at the
conventions since 1996 when the home teams are out of town. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delegates, guests and lobbyists donned batting helmets and
grabbed bats as every swing they made was displayed on the giant
video screen in right field. Then they put on mitts and
attempted to field other players&#8217; hits. Former major league
players Bernie Carbo, Ron LeFlore and Oscar Gamble signed
autographs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Touting &#8220;invited guests&#8221; from the House Energy and
Commerce and Senate Commerce committees, the event&#8217;s sponsors
included telephone and wireless providers Monroe, Louisiana-
based CenturyLink Inc. (CTL) and New York-based Verizon, and the trade
group for wireless companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lawmaker Mingling &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representative Ed Whitfield, a Kentucky Republican who
chairs the House energy and power subcommittee, mingled with the
crowd in between attendees&#8217; swings in the cages and their
catches in the outfield. Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU) of St. Louis and
Pepper Pike, Ohio-based Murray Energy Corp, were listed as event
co-sponsors as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So too was Microsoft, which spent $3.8 million to lobby on
issues such as immigration, cybersecurity and online piracy.
&#8220;We got involved because it benefits youth charities involved
in the community, plus, it&#8217;s a fun event,&#8221; said Christina
Pearson, a spokeswoman for the Redmond, Washington-based
company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lobbyists who are raising money for Romney got their own
chance to brush shoulders with public officials and key aides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell and Arizona Governor Jan Brewer were among the politicians who were scheduled to join
Romney&#8217;s top fundraisers at the convention, according to an
agenda circulating on the Internet and confirmed by
participants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Logo T-Shirts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logo of the largest U.S. phone company, ATT, was
printed on shirts worn by convention volunteers and bags carried
by delegates from Texas, where U.S. Representative Joe Barton is
a senior member of Energy and Commerce Committee. ATT also is
hosting state delegations daily at a nearby restaurant. Claudia Jones, a company spokeswoman, did not return phone calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT spent $10.5 million to lobby during the first six
months of 2012, second only to General Electric Co. (GE) among
corporations, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a
Washington-based research group. Dallas-based ATT last year
failed to win government approval to buy T-Mobile USA Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is the wining and dining that is so effective when
it comes to special interests,&#8221; said Craig Holman of Public
Citizen, a Washington-based advocacy group that favors stricter
limits on lobbying. &#8220;I would call it the reciprocity principle:
You give and you&#8217;ll receive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) was accused in
a lawsuit of manipulating clients&#8217; foreign-exchange transactions
for its own benefit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Louisiana Municipal Police Employees&#8217; Retirement System
filed a complaint yesterday in Manhattan federal court alleging
that the bank took advantage of investors by causing them to pay
what were often the worst currency rates available on a given
trading day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPMorgan&#8217;s scheme allowed it, in violation of its
contractual and fiduciary obligations, to extract hundreds of
millions of dollars in illicit risk free profits from its
clients under the guise of FX trading,&#8221; according to the
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the largest bank in the U.S. by assets, recorded
more than $4 billion in foreign exchange revenue between 2005
and 2011, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pension fund, which is suing on behalf of other
institutional investors for which the New York-based bank
executed currency trades since 2005, is seeking damages,
punitive damages and disgorgement of profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan spokeswoman, Jennifer Zuccarelli, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a call seeking comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Louisiana Municipal Police Employees&#8217;
Retirement System v. JPMorgan Chase  Co., 12-cv-6659, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Qatar National Bank SAQ (QNBK) has hired
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) to advise on its planned acquisition of a
majority stake in Societe Generale SA (GLE)&#8217;s Egyptian unit, Reuters
reported, citing sources it didn&#8217;t identify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Societe Generale, which owns 77.2 percent of Egypt&#8217;s
National Societe Generale Bank SAE (NSGB), is being advised by Morgan
Stanley (MS) on the sale, the newswire said, citing the sources. A
phone message left at with the Doha-based bank spokesman&#8217;s
office was not immediately returned. &lt;/p&gt;
