<p>Morgan Stanley is seeking a
supertanker to store crude oil, joining Citigroup Inc. (C) and Royal
Dutch Shell Plc in trying to profit from higher prices later in
the year, four shipbrokers said. </p>
<p>The bank has yet to find a suitable vessel, said one of the
brokers, all of whom asked not to be identified because the
information is private. Carlos Melville, a spokesman for Morgan
Stanley in London, declined to comment. </p>
<p>There''s a lot of people looking for storage, Denis Petropoulos, London-based head of tankers at Braemar Shipping
Services Plc (BMS), the world''s second-largest publicly traded
shipbroker, said by phone. </p>
<p>Banks and commodity traders are seeking new ways to make
money after the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index fell by the most
since 1937 last year and crude oil prices dropped more than $100
a barrel from their peak. Companies including Koch Industries
Inc. and BP Plc are hoarding enough crude at sea to supply the
world for almost a day. </p>
<p>Frontline Ltd., the world''s biggest owner of supertankers,
yesterday said about 80 million barrels of crude oil are being
stored in tankers, the most in 20 years. A purchaser could buy
oil now, keep it for months at sea and fetch better prices by
selling oil futures that are higher than the spot price. </p>
<p>The so-called contango pricing structure has been caused by
excess oil supply as demand slows and speculation that output
cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will
reduce the glut later this year. </p>
<h2>Tanks Filling Up </h2>
<p>Slumping U.S. oil demand means tanks are filling at Cushing,
Oklahoma, the pricing point for the benchmark West Texas
Intermediate grade. Futures contracts indicate WTI will gain an
average of about $2.15 a barrel a month until December. </p>
<p>Supertanker storage deals are being done at about $75,000 a
day, according to Petropoulos. Assuming the ship has a 2 million-barrel cargo, that works out at $1.12 a barrel over a 30-day
period. Traders also need to pay financing and insurance costs. </p>
<p>Phibro LLC, Citigroup''s commodities trading unit, has the
carrier Ice Transporter stationed off north Scotland, according
to people familiar with the matter. Shell, Europe''s largest oil
company, has booked the supertankers Leander and Eliza. </p>
<p>Oil traders hired two more ships to store North Sea crude
off Scotland''s Orkney Islands. The 2 million-barrel supertanker
Luxembourg is scheduled to arrive at Scapa Flow on Jan. 21 while
the 600,000-barrel transporter Atlantic Galaxy is already there,
said Captain William Sclater, operations manager at the port. </p>
<h2>Oil Grades </h2>
<p>The easiest types of oil to buy for the trade are likely to
be either WTI or the North Sea grades Brent, Forties, Oseberg or
Ekofisk. That''s because they are the ones used to settle the
most-traded futures contracts. </p>
<p>Other oils, such as those from the Middle East and Africa,
are usually bought and sold at prices related to the main
European and U.S. grades. Because those prices fluctuate, it
means traders assume an extra risk by hoarding them. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) owns half of Heidmar Inc., which operates
smaller oil tankers. Heidmar hasn''t had demand for its tankers to
store oil, probably because they aren''t the largest supertankers
that investors need for the contango trade, Tim Brennan, the
company''s chief executive officer, said by phone Jan. 8. </p>

<p>Stocks of road builders and
construction companies were jolted last week when the $819
billion stimulus plan passed by the House of Representatives
proved to have only $30 billion designated for roadways, bridges
and tunnels. </p>
<p>Many investors had expected more money for such
infrastructure projects. Shares in Granite Construction Inc. (GVA), a
road construction company based in Watsonville, California, have
fallen to $36.45 from more than $44 in early January. They had
risen 23 percent in November and December in anticipation of the
stimulus package. </p>
<p>If not road builders, then which stocks will be the major
beneficiaries of the stimulus plan now working its way through
Congress? The dimensions of the plan are huge -- $819 billion in
the House version and about $900 billion in the Senate version --
and the bills are complex. Final details aren''t yet known. </p>
<p>Both plans stick closely to the blueprint provided to
Congress by President Barack Obama. He has met with Congressional
leaders to rally support; so far he has it from most Democrats
but not from Republicans. </p>
<p>Here are six stocks I believe could benefit from the
stimulus package: Pfizer Inc., Nikon Corp. (7731), Jos. A. Bank (JOSB)
Clothiers, Inc, Garmin (GRMN) Ltd., Lincoln Electric (LECO) Holdings Inc. and
Parker Hannifin (PH) Corp. </p>
<h2>Healthcare Emphasis </h2>
<p>The House bill includes $81 billion for Medicaid, a program
that pays for healthcare for poor people. There is also $30
billion to extend the Cobra health-care program for people who
lose their health insurance when they lose a job. These funds
could expand the market for pharmaceuticals. </p>
<p>While several pharma stocks are appealing, I''m especially
partial to Pfizer, the world''s largest drugmaker, based in New
York. It sells for six times earnings and currently yields 8
percent a year in dividends. In a thorny market like the current
one, that dividend yield is especially welcome. Pfizer (PFE) last week
agreed to buy Wyeth for more than $68 billion; I think the
proposed acquisition makes sense. </p>
<p>The administration''s plan includes about $275 million in tax
relief for consumers and businesses. About a third of that total
takes the form of tax cuts for families earning as much as
$150,000 or individuals making up to $75,000. Families would be
eligible for a tax credit of as much as $1,000; individuals would
get one of up to $500. </p>
<h2>Consumer Spending </h2>
<p>I can picture some people using the savings to buy a nice
camera. That would redound to the benefit of Nikon The Tokyo-based company is best known for high-quality cameras; it also
makes microscopes and other instruments. </p>
<p>Nikon (NINOY) stock, traded in the U.S. as an American depositary
receipt, sells for seven times earnings and yields 2.6 percent in
dividends. Its balance sheet is strong, with debt only 24 percent
of stockholders'' equity. </p>
<p>Consumers might take their tax credit and buy some new
clothes. And someone who was recently laid off may want to spend
money on a new suit for job interviews. This could work to the
benefit of Jos. A. Bank, a Hampstead, Maryland-based retailer
selling classic men''s clothing. </p>
<p>Jos. A. Bank pays no dividend, and its stock sells for 10
times earnings. The company has recorded a profit 11 years
running, and the streak should go to 12 when results are reported
for the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 2009. </p>
<h2>Garmin''s Gains </h2>
<p>One more potential beneficiary in the consumer realm is
Garmin, the largest U.S. maker of car-navigation devices. Garmin
had a 59 percent market share in the U.S. as of mid-2008, and a
19 percent share in Europe as of 2007. </p>
<p>Competition and the recession have forced Garmin to cut
prices. Garmin shares fetch a mere five times earnings, and the
stock yields 4 percent in dividends. The Cayman Islands-based
company is debt-free. </p>
<p>The stimulus package also includes provisions designed to
make it easier for businesses to invest in new equipment. These
provisions might benefit Lincoln Electric of Cleveland, the
world''s largest maker of welding equipment. </p>
<p>A few years ago, it looked as if Lincoln might be imperiled
by lawsuits alleging that use of its welding equipment could
produce symptoms similar to those of Parkinson''s Disease.
However, the company prevailed in the vast majority those
lawsuits. Of some 15,000 cases filed, about 12,000 have been
dismissed. Lincoln has lost in four cases, three of which are
being appealed. Lincoln Electric shares trade for seven times
earnings, and the stock yields 2.4 percent in dividends. Debt is
admirably low at 11 percent of equity. </p>
<p>Another potential beneficiary of the proposed liberalized
tax treatment of new-equipment purchases is Parker Hannifin, also
of Cleveland. It is the world''s largest manufacturer of hydraulic
equipment. On Jan. 28 the company announced it had won a contract
worth as much as $2.5 billion to make jet engine parts for Rolls
Royce. </p>
<p>Parker Hannifin''s other products include systems for
regulating fluid flow, fluid purification and assembly line
processes. The stock sells for seven times earnings and yields
2.5 percent in dividends. </p>
<p>Disclosure note: I own shares of Pfizer and Lincoln Electric
personally and for clients. I don''t currently own the other
stocks mentioned in this column. </p>

unusual price changes in Italian trading. Stock symbols are in

<p>Italy''s SP/MIB (FTSEMIB) Index fell for a sixth day, dropping 139, or
0.9 percent, to 15,391. </p>
<p>Antichi Pellettieri SpA (AP IM): The leather-goods unit of
Mariella Burani Fashion Group SpA (MBFG IM) had its price
estimate cut by 19 percent to 4.8 euros at Bank of America Corp.
The brokerage also lowered its price projection by 18 percent to
8.5 euros on Mariella Burani. Bank of America Corp. has Zignago
Vetro SpA (ZV) , a specialist bottle maker, as a top pick in
Italy among small and mid caps on a 12 month-view. </p>
<p>Antichi Pellettieri shares were unchanged at 1.94 euros.
Mariella Burani shares declined 1 cent, or 0.1 percent, to 8.56

<p>Arnoldo Mondadori Editore SpA (MN) : Exane BNP Paribas cut
its price estimate on the publisher controlled by Prime Minister
Silvio Berlusconi to 2.2 euros from 2.5 euros. The shares
declined 13.5 cents, or 4.9 percent, to 2.63 euros. </p>
<p>Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G) : Italy''s biggest insurer
agreed to buy the rest of its Alleanza Assicurazioni SpA (AL IM)
unit, predicting 200 million euros in annual synergies by 2012. </p>
<p>Alleanza will be merged by incorporation into Generali
through a new share issue with an exchange ratio of 0.33 shares
of Generali common stock for every Alleanza share. </p>
<p>Given last week''s announcement the deal should be widely
anticipated and we expect a broadly neutral share price
reaction, Bank of America Corp. analysts Frank Stoffel and Thea
Yates wrote in a note. Financially, the deal appears to be
broadly neutral for Generali''s shareholders at first glance
before considering synergies or restructuring costs.
Strategically, we believe the message is that the unloved
concentration on the three most mature Continental European
markets will even increase going forward and for the foreseeable
future an expansion into faster growing markets is unlikely to be
on the agenda. </p>
<p>Deutsche Bank AG believes Generali is now likely to
outperform the sector ahead of shareholders'' meeting. </p>
<p>Shares of Generali and Alleanza were suspended from trading
yesterday. </p>

Sorgenia SpA, the Italian power generator owned by CIR, rose to
66.7 million euros in 2008 from 65.2 million euros a year
earlier. Deutsche Bank AG reiterated a buy rating on CIR
after Sorgenia''s results. Shares of CIR fell 3.5 cents, or 4.7
percent, to 70.4 cents. </p>
<p>Enel SpA (ENEL) : Italy''s biggest utility had its price
estimate cut to 6.6 euros at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and to 5
euros at Citigroup Inc. The shares added 7.75 cents, or 1.8

<p>Fiat SpA (F) : Moody''s Investors Service cut the long-term
credit ratings of Italy''s biggest carmaker''s to junk, citing
significantly negative free cash flow and concern about the
economic outlook. The shares dropped 21 cents, or 5.6 percent, to
3.55 euros. </p>
<p>Mediobanca SpA (MB) : Italy''s biggest investment bank is
scheduled to hold a conference call on results for its fiscal
second-quarter. Nomura International PLC expects Mediobanca to
report a loss of 111 million euros in the quarter, mainly owing
to the writedown on the equity investment in Telco SpA.
However, the brokerage believes the market will be focused on the
underlying operating trends of the wholesale and retail
divisions. The shares declined 5 cents, or 0.8 percent, to 6.48

<p>When General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP)
bought Rouse Co. for $11.3 billion in 2004, then-Chief Executive
Officer John Bucksbaum said the deal amounted to five years
worth of acquisitions in one fell swoop. Now the challenge
will be keeping those assets. </p>
<p>Purchasing Rouse gave General Growth malls including
Boston''s Faneuil Hall, New York''s South Street Seaport and the
Woodlands in Houston. It also added almost $10 billion in debt
to its balance sheet and led the second-largest U.S. mall owner
to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection yesterday. </p>
<p>Paying the highest price was not the fatal flaw, said
Jim Sullivan, head of retail real estate investment trust
research at Green Street Advisors, a Newport Beach, California-based property research company. The fatal flaw was financing
this giant purchase exclusively with debt. </p>
<p>Mall owners Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG), Macerich Co. (MAC),
Vornado Realty Trust and Taubman Centers Inc. (TCO) rallied yesterday
on speculation the biggest real estate bankruptcy in the U.S.
will allow competitors to buy General Growth''s assets at a
discount. </p>
<p>Hedge fund manager William Ackman, whose firm owns about 25
percent of General Growth, said he doesn''t think the real estate
investment trust will have to resort to a fire sale. </p>
<p>The probability of Simon or the other mall REITs buying
any of General Growth Properties on the cheap is zero, Ackman
said in a telephone interview. They''re not going to be forced
to do anything because they''re in bankruptcy. </p>
<h2>Credit Crunch </h2>
<p>The Rouse acquisition gave General Growth, the owner or
manager of about 200 properties in 44 states, premier malls with
strong occupancy rates and tenants. The company already has
tried to sell South Street Seaport as well as Las Vegas assets
such as Fashion Show Mall and The Shoppes at the Palazzo. </p>
<p>Now that it''s gone Chapter 11, the playbook starts from
scratch, said Jonathan Miniman, senior analyst at ING Clarion
Real Estate Securities, which manages $10.8 billion. This
could be a huge opportunity for the Simons or Vornados of the
world to buy some trophy assets at some pretty good prices. </p>
<p>Indianapolis-based Simon, the largest U.S. shopping mall
owner, has stakes in 386 properties. Vornado Realty Trust (VNO), one
of the country''s biggest office landlords, also owns or manages
more than 31 million square feet of retail properties in the
U.S. and Puerto Rico. ING Clarion is Simon''s seventh-largest
shareholder, with 9 million shares, or 3.7 percent, on Dec. 31. </p>
<h2>High Debt </h2>
<p>The Rouse portfolio for the most part was a really high-quality portfolio, said James S. Corl, managing director for
distressed real estate investments at private-equity firm
Siguler Guff  Co. in New York. Still, with the price General
Growth paid, there was a reason why they were the winning
bidder. They weren''t disciplined on the acquisition front, and
certainly not on the financing front. </p>
<p>The Chicago-based company was blocked by the global credit
freeze from refinancing some of the $27.3 billion of debt it
amassed over the years. General Growth''s debt-to-asset ratio was
92 percent at the time it sought protection, according to the
filing. </p>
<p>The bankruptcy may remake the nation''s mall business and
allow Simon to strengthen its position as the No. 1 mall owner,
said Dan Fasulo, managing director at real estate research firm
Real Capital Analytics. </p>
<h2>Distress'' Cycle </h2>
<p>General Growth''s filing is the beginning of the distress
cycle, Fasulo said, and may lead other companies to fail. </p>
<p>General Growth''s competitors may not have an easy or
immediate way to capitalize on its woes. The company said it
wants to stay intact. Its success may depend on convincing the
bankruptcy judge to consolidate its debts until credit markets
recover. </p>
<p>General Growth on March 23 said that a deadline for
bondholders to agree to new terms for $2.25 billion in debt
expired without the minimum number of holders accepting the
agreement. General Growth said on March 30 it was continuing to
negotiate with creditors. </p>
<p>We''re not looking for wholesale sales of assets,
General Growth President Thomas Nolan said yesterday in an
interview with Bloomberg Television. We intend to emerge as a
leaner company. </p>
<p>Ackman, whose Pershing Square Capital Management LP will
provide General Growth with $375 million in financing to help
run the company during the Chapter 11 process, may join the
board after the court approves the interim financing. Pershing
is the company''s third-largest shareholder. </p>
<h2>Low-Leverage Competition </h2>
<p>Financing for acquisitions remains scarce and some of
General Growth''s individual assets are debt-laden, making them
potentially less attractive to an acquirer. </p>
<p>The nine regional mall owners tracked by Green Street have
an average leverage to asset ratio of 75 percent, according to a
March report by the firm. </p>
<p>CBL  Associates Properties Inc. (CBL) of Chattanooga, Tennessee,
Glimcher Realty Trust (GRT) of Columbus, Ohio and Philadelphia-based
Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust (PEI) have the highest
leverage ratios, at more than 90 percent. Only companies with
relatively low debt ratios, such as Sydney-based Westfield at 56
percent, and Simon and Taubman, each at 60 percent, will likely
have the financial wherewithal to buy assets from General
Growth, said Sullivan. </p>
<h2>No Thaw </h2>
<p>There''s very little sign that the real estate capital
markets are unfreezing in a huge way, said Sullivan. Even
for those raising equity, it''s been very expensive. </p>
<p>Simon on March 20 sold 15 million shares at $31.50 each,
raising $472.5 million, and $650 million of 10-year notes. The
notes were priced to yield 10.75 percent. By comparison, last
May, Simon sold 10-year bonds that were priced to yield 6.14
percent. </p>
<p>They have some very good assets, Stephen E. Sterrett,
Simon''s chief financial officer, said yesterday in a telephone
interview. Some of them would probably fit very well in our
portfolio, but now is probably not the right time to talk about
that. </p>
<p>General Growth in October put three Las Vegas properties up
for sale, the Fashion Show Mall, the Grand Canal Shoppes and the
Shoppes at the Palazzo. Simon''s Forum Shops at Caesars is next
to the Caesars Palace hotel and casino on the Las Vegas Strip. </p>
<p>The issue with the Vegas assets was they were extremely
overleveraged, said Miniman. Fashion Show is one of the best
assets in the country but you couldn''t refinance it. </p>
<h2>No Sale </h2>
<p>General Growth last month received offers of almost $400
million for properties including Faneuil Hall and the South
Street Seaport, according to a person familiar with the matter.
More than 10 bids were received. It didn''t sell. </p>
<p>By going the Chapter 11 route, it helps them maximize
asset values, said Miniman. I think the courts will force
them to sell assets to pay down some of the debt and emerge as a
smaller, better, re-equitized company. </p>
<p>After trying for seven months to refinance its debt,
General Growth filed for bankruptcy, listing $29.5 billion in
assets and debts of about $27.3 billion. General Growth will
continue operating. The company previously suspended its cash
dividend and cut its workforce by 20 percent. </p>
<p>The Rouse transaction sealed the company''s fate, said
Sullivan of Green Street. </p>
<p>General Growth bought Rouse after a bidding contest with
Simon, Westfield and others in what was then the largest
takeover of a real estate investment trust. </p>
<h2>Missed Chance </h2>
<p>By the time some of the debt came due, the credit crunch
halted bank lending and pushed the U.S. into a recession that
cut consumer spending and property values. Commercial real
estate prices in the U.S. dropped 15 percent last year,
according to Moody''s Investors Service. Retail sales in the U.S.
fell in March as job losses forced consumers to pull back. </p>
<p>General Growth had chances to refinance since 2004 and
didn''t take advantage of them, said Sullivan. Now it faces the
prospect of emerging from bankruptcy a smaller player in an
industry that has consolidated to the point where an
oligopoly of publicly traded REITs own about 80 percent of
the country''s malls, he said. </p>
<p>Bigger is better in the mall business, said Sullivan.
The more malls you own, the stronger the relationship is with
your tenants. </p>

<p>General Growth, which has about $27 billion in debt, will
pay an interest rate of the London Interbank Offered Rate plus
12 percentage points, according to a regulatory filing on April
17 by Pershing Square. </p>
<p>It is anticipated that William A. Ackman will join the
board of directors of General Growth once the loan is approved
by the bankruptcy court, though the loan isn''t contingent on his
appointment, the SEC filing said. </p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Allan Gropper scheduled another
hearing in the case for May 8. </p>
<p>Pershing Square also will receive warrants to buy 4.9
percent of the Chicago-based real estate investment trust''s new
equity when it emerges from bankruptcy, the filing said. General
Growth also has the option under certain circumstances to use a
put option that will require Ackman to convert some or all of
the outstanding balance of the loan to equity, according to the
filing. </p>
<p>A lawyer representing the company told Gropper at an April
16 hearing that the opportunity to convert the loan to equity
was an important inducement to the company in taking the loan. </p>
<p>The U.S. Trustee''s Office, the arm of the Justice
Department that monitors bankruptcy cases, has scheduled an
April 24 meeting at the New York Marriott Marquis to form an
unsecured creditors'' committee in the case. </p>
<p>Gropper on April 16 gave General Growth the right to use
so-called cash collateral owed to lenders to continue operating
its business until he decides on the bankruptcy loan. According
to court papers filed with the company''s Chapter 11 petition,
the company will have about $122.4 million in cash on hand at
the end of this week and expects that amount to rise to $238.7
million by July. </p>

<h2>General Growth''s Reliance on Debt May Allow Rivals to Buy Malls </h2>
<p>General Growth Properties Inc.''s purchase of Rouse Co. for
$11.3 billion in 2004 added almost $10 billion in debt to its
balance sheet and led the second-largest U.S. mall owner to file
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection April 16, according to
analysts. </p>
<p>Purchasing Rouse gave General Growth malls including
Boston''s Faneuil Hall, New York''s South Street Seaport and the
Woodlands in Houston. Chief Executive Officer John Bucksbaum
said the deal amounted to five years worth of acquisitions in
one fell swoop. </p>
<p>The fatal flaw was financing this giant purchase
exclusively with debt, said Jim Sullivan, head of retail REIT
research at Green Street Advisors, a Newport Beach, California-based property research company. </p>
<p>Mall owners Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG), Macerich Co. (MAC) and
Taubman Centers Inc. (TCO) rallied April 16 on speculation that the
biggest real estate bankruptcy in the U.S. will allow
competitors to buy General Growth assets at a discount. </p>
<p>William Ackman, whose firm owns about 25 percent of General
Growth, said he doesn''t think the real estate investment trust
will have to resort to a fire sale. </p>
<p>The Rouse acquisition gave General Growth, the owner of
about 200 properties in 44 states, premier malls with strong
occupancy rates and tenants. The company already has tried to
sell South Street Seaport as well as Las Vegas developments like
Fashion Show and the Shoppes at the Palazzo. </p>
<p>The Chicago-based company was blocked by the global credit
freeze from refinancing some of the $27.3 billion of debt.
General Growth''s debt-to-asset ratio was 92 percent at the time
it sought protection, according to the filing. </p>
<p>The bankruptcy may remake the nation''s mall business and
allow Simon to strengthen its position as the No. 1 mall owner,
said Dan Fasulo, managing director at real estate research firm
Real Capital Analytics. </p>

after lenders refused to accept a proposed debt restructuring. </p>
<p>Abitibi-Consolidated listed assets and debt of more than $1
billion in a Chapter 15 petition filed April 17 in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware. Chapter 15 allows a
company to seek protection from creditors in the U.S. while its
primary bankruptcy case is pending in another country. Abitibi-Consolidated Co. of Canada also sought protection. </p>
<p>The newsprint company said April 18 in a statement that
both courts granted the requests it made April 17 and it will be
able to keep paying employees and fulfilling customer orders.
Also, Abitibi-Consolidated will be allowed to enter into debtor-in-possession financing commitments totaling about $200 million
for certain subsidiaries. </p>
<p>The company said its shares will be delisted from the New

<p>The company filed under Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy code,
which lets foreign companies reorganize outside the U.S. while
protecting them from U.S. lawsuits and creditor claims.
Washington Gaming''s main foreign proceeding is in the Supreme
Court of British Columbia in Vancouver, according to papers

<h2>GM Is Still Working on New Plan With U.S. to Avoid Bankruptcy </h2>
<p>General Motors Corp. (GM) is still working with U.S. Treasury
officials on its restructuring plan and trying to avoid
bankruptcy, Chief Executive Officer Fritz Henderson said on a
conference call on April 17. He described the process as much
like a private-equity due-diligence process. </p>
<p>The Obama administration said last month that GM''s initial
plan to cut costs and keep a government loan isn''t sufficient.
Henderson says talks continue with debt holders and unions to
get deeper cuts. The company is operating with $13.4 billion in
U.S. loans and probably still will need $4.6 billion in
additional aid this quarter, Henderson said. </p>
<p>No decision has been made on the amount or timing of
additional federal loans beyond the $13.4 billion GM has
borrowed so far, Henderson said. GM initially had asked for as
much as $16.6 billion in additional loans. Henderson didn''t
specify timing for when funding would be needed. </p>
<p>The Detroit automaker has decided to keep its AC Delco
parts unit and has about three bidders for its Hummer brand,
Henderson said. GM also said it has several parties interested
in buying its Saturn and Saab brands and investing in its German
Opel unit. </p>
<p>GM has received expressions of interest for a stake in its
Opel division from well more than six investors, including
financial companies and manufacturers, Henderson said on a
conference call. </p>
<p>To stay out of court protection, Henderson needs agreements
from unions and debt holders for savings beyond GM''s Feb. 17
proposal for slashing $47 billion in unsecured claims by 59
percent. </p>
<p>GM plans to make a formal offer to bondholders by April 27
to exchange their $27.5 billion in claims for equity, according
to a person with knowledge of the discussions. President Barack Obama''s automotive task force told GM to try to restructure its
debt out of court, people familiar with the matter said. </p>
<h2>Notes on Public Companies </h2>
<h2>Unisys Reviews Debt Options as Credit Line Expires Next Month </h2>
<p>Unisys Corp. (UIS), with more than $2 billion of losses in the
past four years, may lose its line of credit next month, making
it harder and more costly to pay off its 2010 notes as sales
dwindle in the recession. </p>
<p>The computer-services manager for the U.S. government
probably won''t be able to renew a $275 million credit line that
expires May 31, according to a filing last month. The line is
provided by banks led by Bank of America Corp. Unisys, which
ended last year with $544 million in cash and has $300 million
of debt due in March, said it''s reviewing options to pay off the
notes. </p>
<p>Unisys had $62.1 million outstanding from the credit line
at the end of last year. </p>
<p>Sales at Unisys have fallen as customers switch to servers
from the mainframe computers that once were its main business.
The company now relies on services such as managing clients''
computer networks for more than 80 percent of sales. </p>
<p>Unisys debt is rated junk, or below investment grade, and
has a negative outlook from Fitch, Moody''s Corp. and Standard 
Poor''s. As of April 16, its borrowing costs were about 12 times
higher than those of Affiliated Computer and 48 times industry
leader IBM, based on debt yields. </p>

<h2>Six Flags Offers Debt For Equity Exchange on Senior Notes </h2>
<p>Six Flags Inc. (SIX), the New-York based owner of amusement
parks, said it is offering to exchange $588.3 million of its
senior notes for equity. Bond holders would receive about 19
shares for each $1,000 in principle, as well as accrued and
unpaid interest through June 25 on senior notes due 2010, 2013,
and 2014, the company said April 17 in a statement. The proposal
requires 95 percent of the holders to accept the offer and their
tenders would eliminate restrictive covenants and events of
default in the current bond agreement. Six Flags, which missed a
$7 million interest payment, seeks to restructure before a
mandatory Aug. 15 redemption of $287.5 million of Preferred
Income Equity Redeemable Shares, known as PIERS. A Fitch analyst
described this type of offer as a coercive debt exchange. </p>

<h2>Lender Processing Trades Halted on Inquiry News; Bankruptcy Link </h2>
<p>Lender Processing Services Inc. stock trading was halted on
the morning of April 17 after Dow Jones News Service reported
that the company is being investigated by the U.S. Department of
Justice. The probe is linked to evidence that emerged in a U.S.
Bankruptcy Court. </p>
<p>Federal prosecutors are probing whether Lender Processing''s
automated mortgage systems provided inaccurate information to
lawyers who rely on it for court evidence, Dow Jones said. </p>
<p>The company''s stock plunged as much as 37 percent after Dow
Jones News Service reported that the company was the subject of
an inquiry by the U.S. Trustees Office, an arm of the Justice
Department that monitors bankruptcy courts. </p>
<p>A ruling by Judge Diane Weiss Sigmund in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Philadelphia questioned inaccurate court filings made
by HSBC Mortgage Corp. in a personal bankruptcy case. HSBC
relied on electronic information from a Lender Processing system
that manages foreclosure data. Sigmund''s 58-page decision,
released April 16, said the homes of poor and unfortunate
debtors threatened with foreclosure were at issue. </p>
<p>Lender Processing, based in Jacksonville, Florida, runs an
automated system to track mortgage payments and defaults and as
recently as 2007 was used by 39 of the country''s 50 largest
banks, according to Sigmund''s ruling. </p>
<p>Lender Processing issued a statement on PRNewswire saying
it was unaware of an investigation and has voluntarily

<h2>BearingPoint Gets Approval to Sell Most Assets to Deloitte </h2>
<p>BearingPoint Inc., the bankrupt provider of computer
services to the U.S. Navy, won permission to sell most of its
assets to Deloitte LLP for about $350 million. In approving the
sale, a bankruptcy judge overruled concerns that the sale gutted
the estate to the detriment of many creditors. </p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Gerber said in Manhattan court
on April 17 that BearingPoint can proceed with the sale to New
York-based Deloitte 60 days into its reorganization, after
receiving no competing bids. </p>
<p>Business partners objected to the way the sale might treat
intellectual property. Bondholders, unsecured creditors and
noteholders objected to the sale. Concerns were also raised that
the sale would cut off the right to pursue claims in lawsuits.
Gerber told the parties to amend the sale agreement to resolve
objections. </p>
<p>Gerber was concerned that a delay might decrease the value
of BearingPoint''s assets as its liquidity dwindles. He also
ruled April 17 that BearingPoint''s managers and directors acted
in good faith in deciding to make the sale, a finding that
would shield them from lawsuits claiming otherwise. </p>

Appaloosa Management LP that claimed the hedge fund worked to
scuttle the auto-parts maker''s bankruptcy exit loan and sold
short Delphi securities while saying it would support the
company''s emergence from Chapter 11. </p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain gave Delphi permission
to amend its complaint at a hearing April 17 in New York. Delphi
chose to drop a portion of the complaint because it was having
difficulty collecting sufficient evidence to show willful
misconduct, according to court papers. </p>
<p>Troy, Michigan-based Delphi sued after an Appaloosa-led
group of investors backed out of a $2.55 billion deal to buy
equity in its reorganized business in April 2008 on the day
Delphi planned to exit bankruptcy. Appaloosa said Delphi didn''t
meet the deal''s terms and was relying too heavily on former
parent General Motors Corp. for financial support. Delphi said
it complied with the terms of the deal. </p>
<p>A trial is planned for mid-June. </p>

<h2>Downgrades </h2>
<h2>Headwaters'' Corporate Family Rating Downgraded by Moody''s </h2>
<p>Headwaters Inc. (HW), converter of fossil fuels and other
resources into alternative energy, had its corporate family
rating downgraded to Caa1 from B2 by Moody''s Investors Service
April 17, the ratings company said in a statement. </p>
<p>Moody''s also downgraded the company''s senior secured credit
facility to B1 from B2 and the probability of default rating was
lowered to Caa1/LD, the statement said. The LD denoted a
limited default according to the statement. </p>
<p>The downgrade reflects earnings pressure on Headwaters
businesses due to weaknesses in the housing and commercial
construction sectors, Moody''s said in the statement. Moody''s
also noted concern that the company had not replaced or
extended its revolving credit facility, which matures in early
September, 2009 and is the company''s primary source of
liquidity, the statement said. </p>
<h2>Mega Brands, Toymaker, Sees Moody Downgrade Its Ratings </h2>
<p>Mega Brands, Inc., worldwide maker and marketer of toys,
had its ratings and those of its guaranteed subsidiaries
downgraded by Moody''s Investors Service April 17, according to a
statement issued by the ratings company. </p>
<p>Moody''s downgraded the corporate family rating to Ca from
Caa2 and the probability of default rating to Caa3 from Caa2,
the statement said. The ratings outlook is negative, according
to the statement. </p>
<p>Moody''s said the ratings downgrades reflect the fact that
financial flexibility of the company deteriorated further in the
fourth quarter of 2008 due both to lower than expected sales and
high costs, the statement said. Moody''s noted that the company
faces challenges that include risks specific to the toy industry
and general risks of the retail business. </p>
<h2>MetoKote, Industrial Coating Maker, Downgraded by SP </h2>
<p>MetoKote Inc., a maker of industrial coating for autos,
appliances and other applications, saw its corporate credit
rating downgraded to CCC+ from B by Standard  Poor''s Ratings
Services on April 17, a statement by the ratings service said. </p>
<p>SP said in the statement the outlook is developing. </p>
<p>SP also lowered the issue-level rating on the company''s
senior secured debt to CCC+ from B+, revising its recovery
rating to 3 from 2, indicating its expectation of meaningful
recovery for lenders in the event of a payment default, the
statement said. The ratings were removed from CreditWatch, where
they had been placed with negative implications on Nov. 13,
according to the statement. </p>
<p>The downgrade reflect SP''s view that declining light-vehicle sales and production in North America and Europe during
2009 will continue to lower the company''s profitability and cash
flow generation, the statement said. </p>

Fiat SpA (F)''s Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne will travel
to Berlin on May 4 for talks with the German government and

LLC on April 30 after five months of negotiations, has said
repeatedly it is also interested in Opel. The German carmaker
needs to find an investor because it''s running out of cash as
its parent faces potential bankruptcy by June 1. </p>

<p>General Motors Corp. (GM), which is
selling its Opel unit while preparing for a probable June 1
bankruptcy, attracted three bids for the German division,
according to Chris Preuss, a spokesman for GM Europe. </p>
<p>Fiat SpA (F), Italy''s largest carmaker, presented an offer for
GM''s Opel and Vauxhall divisions in Europe as part of a plan to
combine with them and with Chrysler LLC in the U.S., the Turin-based manufacturer said today in a statement. </p>
<p>Magna International Inc. (MG), a Canadian car-parts maker, and
RHJ International (RHJI) SA, a Brussels-based investment firm started
by Ripplewood Holdings LLC founder Timothy Collins, submitted
detailed offers for Opel to the German government, said a state
official, speaking on condition that he not be identified

is based in the Frankfurt suburb of Ruesselsheim and has
assembly plants in countries including Spain, Belgium and
Poland. Vauxhall builds cars in the U.K. </p>
<h2>Significant Progress'' </h2>
<p>German Chancellor Angela Merkel''s government made
significant progress yesterday in talks with state-owned
banks including KfW Group toward securing bridge loans of at
least 1 billion euros ($1.38 billion) for Opel, Juergen Reinholz, economy minister of the state of Thuringia, said
yesterday in a phone interview. A decision on a winning bid may
take until June, he added. </p>
<p>Government officials are likely to meet this week to
discuss the Opel bids and will convene as often as they need to
find a solution very quickly, Labor Minister Olaf Scholz
told reporters in Berlin today. </p>
<p>GM rose 18 cents, or 14 percent, to $1.45 at the close of
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </p>
<p>Without a bridge loan, Opel will run out of money during
the third quarter, GM Europe President Carl-Peter Forster said
on May 15. Aurora, Ontario-based Magna''s bid would focus on
Russia, while Fiat''s plan would have a Latin American emphasis,
Forster said in a May 15 interview. Fiat Chief Executive Officer
Sergio Marchionne said in early May that he''s interested in an
as-yet-undefined venture with GM in Latin America. </p>
<p>We will work with all parties over the next few days on
how to proceed in terms of getting memoranda of understanding
with the bidder or bidders, GM Europe''s Preuss said in a
telephone interview today. </p>
<h2>States Favor Magna </h2>
<p>The four German states where Opel employs 25,000 workers
predominantly favor Magna''s proposal, which shuns factory
closures in Europe''s biggest economy, Hendrik Hering, economy
minister of Rhineland-Palatinate, said today. Magna wants to
turn Opel into an integrated automaker and supply it with
components directly. </p>
<p>The supplier angle is extremely attractive. That''s
something that Fiat is lacking, Hering said in a phone
interview. At the same time, job cuts may be considerable
under Magna, he added. </p>
<p>The offer from Fiat seems to have been well received by
German regional governments, Italian Industry Minister Claudio Scajola told reporters today in Rome, without providing details.
Germany''s Economy Ministry has no favorite bidder for Opel,
Steffen Moritz, a spokesman in Berlin, said today. </p>
<p>Arnaud Denis, a spokesman for RHJ in Brussels, declined to
comment. Daniel Witzani, a Magna spokesman based in
Oberwaltersdorf, Austria, couldn''t be reached on his cell phone. </p>
<h2>Fiat''s Labor Meetings </h2>
<p>Fiat has been the most vocal suitor for Opel. Marchionne
met with labor unions and German state politicians in the past
week in an effort to defuse concerns about a plan that worker
leaders have said may lead to losses of as many as 18,000
automotive-industry jobs in Europe. </p>
<p>It''s not just an Opel issue, Marchionne, who engineered
a deal to control most of the assets of Auburn Hills, Michigan-based Chrysler, said in an interview yesterday. It''s a
question of industry saturation. We need to handle this in an
intelligent way in Europe. It doesn''t have to be as drastic and
draconian as the American solution. </p>
<p>RHJ gets more than two-thirds of revenue from sales of
automotive parts. The company is led by CEO Leonhard Fischer,

<h2>European Aid Needs </h2>
<p>GM has said it needs 3.3 billion euros in aid from European
governments to secure Opel''s survival. Merkel''s coalition
government, facing elections on Sept. 27, is keen to avoid a
collapse at Opel, which is Germany''s second-largest carmaker
after Volkswagen AG and is identified by a lightning-bolt
trademark. The Economy Ministry said on May 18 that it may send
a negotiating team to the U.S. this week to seek an agreement on
plans for Opel. </p>
<p>Opel is an integral brand of German carmaking, a true
symbol of this country''s postwar recovery, Reinholz said.
Governments have every reason to ponder all possible ways to
try and rescue the company. </p>

<p>It will be a shame if General Motors
Corp. (GM) goes into bankruptcy proceedings simply because the U.S.
government and the automaker''s bondholders can''t compromise. </p>
<p>General Motors -- or rather, government appointees pulling
the strings -- offered owners of GM bonds a 10 percent equity
stake in a restructured company in exchange for $27 billion in
debt securities. </p>
<p>The bondholders objected, saying GM, until last year the
world''s largest vehicle manufacturer, was discriminating against
them in favor of its workers. </p>
<p>While the bondholders were voting against the proposal
Tuesday, Detroit-based General Motors got the United Auto
Workers to reduce to 17.5 percent the equity in the new GM to be
owned by a union health-care trust. A previous agreement called
for 39 percent. The UAW trust also gets $6.5 billion of
preferred stock and a $2.5 billion note. </p>
<p>This new agreement gives GM and the government some wiggle
room. Why not offer the bondholders a 20 percent stake in the
remade General Motors? There would still be at least 60 percent
left for the taxpayers, and maybe a dribble for current GM
shareholders. </p>
<p>Wouldn''t that be preferable to the company going into
bankruptcy? Chrysler LLC, the also-ran among U.S. automakers,
sought court protection last month after its debt holders
refused an offer of $2.25 billion for $6.9 billion in face value
for their securities. </p>
<h2>Not So Easy </h2>
<p>While the Chrysler bankruptcy may be on a fast track to
completion -- with its best assets sold to Italian automaker
Fiat (F) SpA -- a court proceeding for the much bigger and far-flung
General Motors might become an ordeal that benefits only the
lawyers. </p>
<p>The U.S. already has invested $19 billion in General Motors
and intends to dump in tens of billions more. Don''t waste money
in court. </p>
<p>It''s a bit of mystery why GM bondholders have been so
recalcitrant. They say the government is trampling on their
property rights and prefer to take their chances with a
bankruptcy judge. </p>
<p>Not all of the bondholders are speculators, as President
Barack Obama said. But some of them are -- they bought GM debt
on the cheap, betting on a windfall. That may make their legal
pleading look less reasonable. </p>
<p>Longer-term holders of GM bonds may have a better case.
Still, you wonder if they''re not just seeking cover for their
own poor investments. GM bonds due in 2033, for instance, trade
at between 5 cents and 7 cents on the dollar, compared with
about 70 cents a year ago. </p>
<h2>Something or Nothing </h2>
<p>If a restructured General Motors can''t compete any better
against foreign rivals than the old one, the bondholders
wouldn''t benefit if they owned 100 percent of the company. On
the other hand, if the new GM prospers, a 10 percent stake might
wipe out bad investment memories. </p>
<p>An offer from the government now to give the investors a 20
percent stake would be subject to the same sort of reasoning. A
bigger equity share in a continuing flop would have no more
value than a smaller share. Still, if General Motors does have a
profitable future, the bondholders could double up on their
share of the earnings. </p>
<p>The deadline for GM to restructure outside of bankruptcy
court is Monday. As a taxpayer, I''m willing to reduce my share
of the government''s stake in the company if they offer the
bondholders more. Do it. Fast. </p>

<p>Municipal bondholders with $700
million of General Motors Corp.-backed debt will have to wait
until the company develops a plan to exit bankruptcy to find out
how much, if anything, will be repaid. </p>
<p>GM, the largest manufacturer to go bankrupt, has used the
municipal bond market to pay for features at plants from
Michigan to Georgia. The Detroit-based carmaker''s plan for
repayment is still being evaluated, and a decision will be
made by the time a new company is formed to emerge from
bankruptcy, said GM spokeswoman Julie Gibson. </p>
<p>The investors are in limbo, said Richard Lehmann, a
registered investment adviser in Miami Lakes, Florida, and
president of Income Securities Advisors Inc. There''s real
concern for the bondholders. </p>
<p>Unsecured corporate bondholders will share in a 10 percent
stake in the new GM when the company emerges from Chapter 11
bankruptcy, according to court documents. The new government-controlled GM will keep major assets of the old company. GM
backed 15 bond issues in eight states totaling just over $700
million, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>There is uncertainty about what''s going to happen in
bankruptcy, said Dan Solender, who oversees $10 billion as
director of municipal bond management at Lord Abbett  Co. in
Jersey City, New Jersey. His firm owns about $7 million of GM-backed bonds in Ohio and Michigan, according to Bloomberg data. </p>
<h2>Tax Exempt </h2>
<p>Federal laws allow state and local governments to lend
their names to corporations wanting to sell tax-exempt debt for
specific types of facilities at plants such as pollution-control
or sewer systems. </p>
<p>The municipalities that allow their names to be used to
sell the debt don''t bear any liability for repayment. So far,
none of the General Motors-backed debt has missed any payments,
according to Bloomberg data. A June 1 payment due for bonds sold
for pollution-control equipment at a facility in Fort Wayne,
Indiana, was made, according to Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>Repayment will hinge, as it has in other bankruptcies
involving corporate-backed municipal debt, on whether GM decides
to keep an asset funded with the debt in the company going
forward, said James Spiotto, a partner and municipal bankruptcy
expert with the law firm of Chapman  Cutler in Chicago. </p>
<p>Until it is clear what''s going to happen with the assets,
you can''t predict what''s going to happen with the debt,
Spiotto said. </p>
<h2>Anticipating Bankruptcy </h2>
<p>Prices of some GM-backed municipal bonds had fallen in
recent months to less than 10 cents on the dollar, Bloomberg
data show, as investors sold the debt in anticipation of
bankruptcy. Those prices are similar to unsecured benchmark GM
corporate bonds, which have risen since the filing. </p>
<p>GM-backed municipal debt has risen since the filing earlier
this week. A GM-backed bond for a solid waste disposal facility
at a plant in Moraine, Ohio, traded at 9.75 cents on the dollar
in April. After the filing it rose as high as 15 cents. </p>
<p>The prices are based on investors'' estimates about how much
debt in the new company will be worth, said John Miller, chief
investment officer of Nuveen Asset Management in Chicago.
Nuveen, which has about $115 billion under management, sold its
GM-backed municipal securities earlier this year. </p>
<p>Fifteen cents on the dollar is probably pretty close to
what GM''s unsecured obligations are worth today, Miller said. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s biggest
drugmaker, failed to maintain its patent on the hypertension
drug Norvasc in Canada after a federal judge granted Ratiopharm
GmbH permission to sell a generic version of the medicine. </p>
<p>More than 7.8 million prescriptions of amlodipine besylate,
marketed by Pfizer as Norvasc, are sold annually in Canada, Ulm,
Germany-based Ratiopharm said yesterday. A generic version
probably will save Canadian patients about C$180 million ($155
million) a year, the closely held company said. Pfizer said it
will appeal. </p>
<p>We are extremely pleased at the decision by the Federal
Court, Jean-Guy Goulet, chief executive officer of Ratiopharm
Canada, said in a statement. This decision opens the
amlodipine patent to generic manufacturers in Canada, the last
major jurisdiction where the patent was held. </p>
<p>Ratiopharm challenged the Canadian patent in 2004 and won
in 2006. Pfizer successfully reversed the ruling on appeal.
Ratiopharm then sued to invalidate Pfizer''s patent, with Judge
Roger Hughes ruling in favor of Ratiopharm yesterday. </p>
<p>The three-paragraph judgment says the patent is invalid
and void and orders the Canadian Patent Office to record an
entry to that effect. Hughes didn''t release the reasons for his
decision, giving the two sides 20 days to make submissions on
which portions of the reasons should remain confidential. </p>
<p>Pfizer said in a statement that it will ask the Federal
Court of Appeal of Canada to overturn the decision. The New
York-based company also said legal challenges to the patent in
Canada by other drugmakers are still pending. </p>
<p>Pfizer remains committed to protecting its intellectual
property rights and to ensuring the long-term viability of its
research and development programs, the company said in the
statement. </p>
<p>Ratio-Amlodipine, Ratiopharm''s version of Norvasc, will be
available in Canadian pharmacies imminently, the company
said. Norvasc sales plunged 52 percent in the first quarter of
2008 to $513 million after generic copies of the medicine came
on the U.S. market in March 2007. </p>

<p>The company said the U.S. Customs and Border Protection
Agency issued a ruling finding the Vizio sets don''t infringe
U.S. Patent 6,115,074 owned by Japan''s Funai Electric Co. In
March, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued its final
rejection of the disputed patent. </p>
<p>Vizio then sued Funai in federal court in Virginia on May
20, accusing the Japanese company of infringing seven patents
related to flat-panel televisions. </p>
<p>Rob Brinkman, Vizio''s vice president of operations, said
the customs ruling, together with the patent office action, will

<h2>Copyright </h2>
<h2>EU Seeks to Reform Copyright Rules to Compete With Google Books </h2>
<p>The European Union''s executive arm plans to change
copyright rules that have prevented the bloc''s Internet
companies from competing with Google Inc. (GOOG)''s book-scanning
service. </p>
<p>Viviane Reding, European media commissioner, said common EU
rules are needed so companies can provide an alternative to
Google''s Web-based book publication service. </p>
<p>Reding said she understands the fears of many publishers
and librarians facing the market power of Google. Internet
companies are frustrated by the fragmented regulatory system
in Europe, she said in a speech in Brussels yesterday. </p>
<p>Reding''s call for harmonized rules follows complaints from
German authors that Google, owner of the most-visited Internet
search engine, is violating copyright laws by allowing their
works to be viewed online free of charge and without previous
author approval. Google, based in Mountain View, California, is
creating an online book database by scanning millions of titles
from libraries. </p>
<p>The company reached a $125 million deal with publishers
last year to settle copyright issues. The U.S. Justice
Department began an antitrust probe last month of the
settlement, which could make Google the main online source for
millions of out-of-print books. </p>
<p>Book digitization projects send a strong signal that
authors, publishers, libraries and technology companies can work
together to bring back to life the world''s lost books,
Santiago de la Mora, Google''s head of European book
partnerships, said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Germany asked European regulators in May to look into how
the settlement, which must be reviewed by a U.S. federal court,
affects authors'' rights in the EU. </p>
<p>Reding said 90 percent of books in Europe''s national
libraries are no longer commercially available for scanning.
That''s because they are either out of print or so-called orphan
books, titles for which no one can be identified to give
permission for digital use, she said. </p>
<p>Without change attractive content offers won''t take place
in Europe, but on the other side of the Atlantic, Reding said. </p>
<p>She proposed a registry for out-of-print and orphan books
that would allows authors to get fair remuneration for
online publications. A registry would help end the rather
ideological debate on Google books, she said. </p>
<h2>Symantec Gets $18 Million in Judgments Over Software </h2>
<p>Symantec Corp. (SYMC), the world''s largest maker of security
software, said yesterday it was awarded a total of $18.6 million
in damages against two closely held companies that it accused of
distributing fake versions of its products. </p>
<p>Federal courts in Los Angeles and San Jose, California,
ruled against V-Micro Inc. and Higher Model Computer LLC in
February, court records show. Symantec waited to publicize the
awards to squeeze the companies for information about their
distribution networks and locate bigger fish, said Cris Paden, a spokesman for Cupertino, California-based Symantec. </p>
<p>We''ve never really focused on recovering damages in these
types of rulings, Paden said yesterday in an e-mail. Our
main focus has always been to protect unsuspecting users and
prospective customers. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Samuel Conti on Feb. 4 ordered New
Jersey-based V-Micro to pay Symantec $9.7 million for violating
its trademarks and copyrights by distributing counterfeit
software. Two weeks later, U.S. District Judge Stephen Wilson in
Los Angeles ordered Connecticut-based Higher Model to pay $8.9
million. Court records show that neither company had responded
to the complaints, which were filed in 2007 and 2008. </p>
<p>The damage awards are a way of financially crippling the
piracy rings by having a legal ruling to seize their assets,
usually to pay for damages, Paden said. </p>
<p>The companies were accused of selling knockoffs of Symantec
products including Norton Antivirus and Norton Ghost. The
default judgment rulings against the companies bar them from
using the copyrighted software or the trademarked product names. </p>
<p>Representatives of V-Micro and Higher Model couldn''t be
reached for comment through phone directory listings, and
lawyers for the companies weren''t listed on court dockets. </p>
<p>Higher Model was sued by Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) in 1999 for
dealing in counterfeit software, Symantec said in court papers.
A federal court in Connecticut awarded Microsoft money damages
and a court order barring Higher Model from violating its
trademarks or copyrights, Symantec said. </p>
<p>Symantec learned that Higher Model was buying Symantec-branded software from unauthorized distributors and selling it
to customers who thought it was legitimate. Symantec bought the
disks and inspected them for authenticity. In 2006, the company
warned Higher Model it was dealing in counterfeit products and
later sent it a cease-and-desist letter. </p>
<p>The defendants willfully and maliciously continued to
purchase and sell counterfeit Symantec products even after they
were given an opportunity by Symantec to purchase from
legitimate distributors, the software maker said in court
filings. </p>
<p>The cases are Symantec Corp. v. Higher Model Computer LLC,
2:07-cv-06581, U.S. District Court, Central District of
California (Los Angeles) and Symantec Corp. v. V-Micro Inc.,
3:08-cv-02063, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
California (San Jose). </p>

<h2>Mary Kay Sues Yahoo! for Infringement by Hyperlinks in E-Mails </h2>
<p>Mary Kay Corp. sued Yahoo! Inc. for trademark infringement. </p>
<p>The Sunnyvale, California-based Internet media company is
accused of inserting hyperlinks that infringe the Mary Kay
trademarks into messages sent to those who receive e-mail on
Yahoo! Mail. </p>
<p>These hyperlink ads are often from unauthorized resellers
of Mary Kay cosmetics and neither the Dallas-based cosmetics
company nor its independent sales agents have authorized their
use of the company trademarks, according to court papers filed
July 6 in federal court in Dallas. </p>
<p>Mary Kay says a substantial number of the recipients of
marketing emails sent by the cosmetics company or its authorized
independent consultants are users of Yahoo! Inc.''s e-mail
service. The recipients are likely to believe the hyperlink ads
were authorized by Mary Kay and are likely to be confused and
follow the links to unauthorized sellers, according to court
papers. </p>
<p>The hyperlink ads appear with no indication that the e-mails were manipulated and revised en route by Yahoo! without
the authorization of Mary Kay, the cosmetics company said in
its pleadings. </p>
<p>Mary Kay asked the court for an order barring Yahoo from
inserting any hyperlinks, Webtags, advertisements, text or
other materials using its marks into e-mails sent or received
by the Yahoo! Inc., e-mail subscribers. </p>
<p>Additionally, it''s seeking an accounting and award of
Yahoo!''s profits related to the alleged infringement, attorney
fees and money damages. </p>
<p>Veronica S. Lewis and Allen W. Yee of Houston-based Vinson
 Elkins LLP represent Mary Kay. </p>

polygamy drama Big Love showed what appeared to be the
university''s logo on a piece of letterhead, Salt Lake City''s

<p>General Motors Co. (GM), seeking to
salvage its European operations after emerging from bankruptcy,
gave bidders for Opel two days to submit final offers. </p>
<p>Magna International Inc. (MG), RHJ International SA (RHJI) and Beijing
Automotive Industry Holding Co. have until the close of business
on July 20 to make bids for the German carmaker, GM said in a
statement yesterday. The offers will be reviewed and a buyer may
be proposed to Germany''s Opel trust board by the following week,
said three people with knowledge of the plans. </p>
<p>Germany, which agreed to provide 1.5 billion euros
($2.1 billion) in short-term loans for Opel''s sale, is pushing
GM to pick Magna as the winner, two people familiar with the
situation said earlier. While investment group RHJ would cut
fewer than 10,000 jobs at GM''s European plants, compared with
the 11,000 proposed by Magna, that doesn''t make the bid more
attractive, German Deputy Economy Minister Jochen Homann said. </p>
<p>Magna, Canada''s largest car-parts maker, still has an
edge because it has been in talks with GM longer, Homann said
in a telephone interview after meeting with executives from
Brussels-based RHJ in Berlin July 15. He added that RHJ is
catching up in the process. </p>
<p>GM''s talks with bidders for Opel will clarify final open
questions about financing in the next few days, German
government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm said yesterday in Berlin.
Talks with RHJ and Magna are more advanced than with BAIC, he
said. </p>
<p>Germany chose a pairing of Aurora, Ontario-based Magna and
Russian lender OAO Sberbank as the preferred bidder for Opel on
May 30. Beijing Auto and Fiat SpA also submitted proposals for
the carmaker, which is based in the Frankfurt suburb of
Ruesselsheim and employs 55,000 people across Europe. </p>
<h2>Russian Issue </h2>
<p>The primary issues remaining with Magna have to do with the
involvement of Russia, the people said. </p>
<p>Sberbank has proposed a direct investment in Opel''s Russian
operations that would dilute GM''s ownership of the venture there
more than originally agreed, said one person. Also, the proposal
values Opel''s operations at 170 million euros, a fraction of
GM''s valuation, the person said without giving a figure. </p>
<p>Most issues involving GM''s intellectual property have now
been resolved, with one possible disagreement over the use of
the technology by Sberbank, according to the person. </p>
<p>RHJ would invest about 275 million euros in Opel and seek
government loans of about 3.8 billion euros in exchange for a
50.1 percent stake, the person said. GM could get about
39.9 percent with the rest going to employees, the person said. </p>
<p>Fiat (F) is not expected to renew a bid for the unit, according
to one of the people. </p>
<h2>Government Review </h2>
<p>Once received, the final bids and GM''s preliminary findings
will be reviewed with the government in Germany and with other
countries affected, as well as with the EU Commission and the
Opel/Vauxhall Trust Board, set up by Germany as part of the
agreement for government bridge loans, GM said in a statement. </p>
<p>The Detroit-based company will present the Opel trust board
with preliminary analysis by July 22, one of the people said. GM
intends to have a recommendation by the following week to
present to its board of directors and the U.S. Treasury. The
U.S. government controls 60.1 percent of GM after it emerged
from a U.S.-backed bankruptcy on July 10. </p>
<p>The recommendation, if approved, could come back to the
Opel trust board for review that same week, the person said. The
trust board must approve any bid before a deal is signed. </p>
<p>Spokesmen at GM Europe, RHJ, Magna and Fiat declined to
comment. Wang Hong, a Beijing Auto spokesman, couldn''t be
reached for comment. </p>
<h2>Ripplewood Holdings </h2>
<p>RHJ has automotive assets including some former holdings of
Ripplewood Holdings LLC, the New York-based private-equity firm
founded by Timothy Collins. RHJ said July 13 it was in
advanced talks about acquiring a majority holding in Opel. </p>
<p>Magna''s group has offered to invest 500 million euros for
20 percent of Opel''s equity, leaving GM and Sberbank with
35 percent each and Opel workers with 10 percent. </p>
<p>Homann, who leads talks with GM and bidders for Opel, said
RHJ is calling for no more than 3.8 billion euros in state loan
guarantees, compared with 4.5 billion euros requested by Magna. </p>

<p>Banks continue to feast at the
bailout banquet while consumers are getting thrown the crumbs. </p>
<p>The most vexing result of last year''s financial meltdown is
that loans are harder to get and more expensive, even if your
credit is good. Yet on Wall Street, happy days look like they
are here again. </p>
<p>To almost no one''s surprise, the nation''s largest banks are
returning to their old, pre-crisis ways, even in the midst of a
$23.7 trillion bailout, the biggest financial rescue in history. </p>
<p>Banks based on trading and highly leveraged business models
still pose a huge risk to the financial system, so much so that
our government has enshrined as policy the doctrine of too big
to fail. Haven''t we learned anything from the past year? </p>
<p>While trading and investment-banking profits for Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. soared in the second
quarter, Washington''s attitude toward policing financial
services practices is still a weak, unpracticed theory. </p>
<p>The second banking crisis unfolds with the realization that
reckless banking practices translated into $65 trillion in
global wealth lost since September 2007, says Nomi Prins, a
former Goldman Sachs managing director, who is publishing a book
on the financial debacle titled It Takes A Pillage. This
meltdown will continue to pummel Western economies for years if
not decades. </p>
<p>Culture Thriving </p>
<p>Prins, who once marketed collateralized debt obligations --
which were often used to bundle toxic mortgages -- notes that
the largest banks have actually grown during this crisis: Bank
of America Corp. took over Merrill Lynch  Co., JPMorgan assumed
Bear Stearns Cos. and Wells Fargo  Co. acquired Wachovia Corp. </p>
<p>Bigger isn''t better for consumers. Prins says these
institutions have less incentive (since they have more market
share) to offer higher savings rates, or broader credit terms to
consumers, or open mortgage restructuring policies, or even
lower fees on regular accounts -- they simply don''t have to, and
it was not a condition of their bailout money to make it so. </p>
<p>Nothing has changed in recent months, except that taxpayers
are increasingly getting treated as if they''re homeless and
begging for money. Congress has yet to find the gumption to make
lower financing rates and foreclosure-halting mortgage
modifications mandatory. </p>
<p>Banks are bringing in more money, although they aren''t
making credit widely available, prolonging the recession. </p>
<p>Consumers Aren''t Helped </p>
<p>While two-thirds of all government-insured banks reported
asset growth in the first quarter, total loans fell by about
$160 billion, or 2.1 percent, according to the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. </p>
<p>Of those banks that received bailout money from the
government''s Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, only 29 of
103 surveyed said they loaned out funds for residential
mortgage activities. </p>
<p>A July 21 report from the TARP special inspector general
also noted that 17 of 61 banks surveyed said they were doing
other consumer lending and only nine of 34 banks were doing
mortgage-loan modifications. </p>
<p>Banks are missing in action on the foreclosure front as
well. Only a handful of mortgages for those facing default due
to higher adjustable rates or job losses are being modified. A
recent Federal Reserve of Boston study found that only 3 percent
of seriously delinquent loans were being made more
affordable by the banks they studied. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, lending across the board has tightened.
Mortgages are difficult to obtain -- even for the most
creditworthy -- and banks are lowering credit-card limits, which
can impair one''s ability to borrow if your credit scores drop. </p>
<p>Little Support </p>
<p>Even as the cost of funds to banks has held near historic
lows since the end of last year, annual credit-card finance
rates rose from an average of 12.02 percent to 13.08 percent
between November and February, according to the Congressional
Oversight Panel. </p>
<p>If anything, fees on credit cards and bank accounts will
continue to rise as banks try to recoup their losses and shift
their risk to you through obnoxious overdraft fees, higher
finance rates and lower credit limits. </p>
<p>Want to push back? Just maybe the best treatment for mega-
banking''s avarice-addled culture is for us to stop enabling
their addiction. </p>
<p>Your best recourse may be to limit credit card use, make
insured deposits at local thrifts and regional banks -- the
deposit insurance limit is generally $250,000 per account
through 2013 -- and turn to alternative sources of lending such
as credit unions and your own family. Avoid commission-based
services through banks, insurers and brokers. </p>
<p>A brand-name big bank may represent the old way of doing
business. And that''s been one of the surest ways to part you
from your wealth. </p>

<p>President Barack Obama sent Congress
his plan to rein in the $592 trillion over-the-counter
derivatives industry, a measure that would cut into a profitable
market for banks led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) </p>
<p>The proposal issued yesterday would pressure derivatives
users such as banks and hedge funds to move away from opaque
customized contracts by imposing higher capital and margin
requirements on the instruments. Standardized derivatives would
be moved to regulated exchanges or trading platforms and sent
through official clearinghouses, according to the draft measure. </p>
<p>The big broker dealers make a lot of money trading these
customized derivatives, said Paul Miller, a banking analyst
for FBR Capital Markets in Arlington, Virginia. </p>
<p>Custom derivatives are more profitable than contracts
traded over an exchange, so the dealers will work to get the
legislation watered down, Miller said. The derivatives
proposal is part of a broader overhaul of financial industry
rules meant to prevent a repeat of last year, when the collapse
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and American International
Group Inc. (AIG) froze credit markets. </p>
<p>These markets have largely gone unregulated since their
inception, the U.S. Treasury said in a statement yesterday.
Enormous risks built up in these markets -- substantially out
of the view or control of regulators -- and these risks
contributed to the collapse of major financial firms in the past
year and severe stress throughout the financial system. </p>
<h2>Biggest Users </h2>
<p>New York-based JPMorgan was the largest derivatives user
among U.S. banks as of March 31, with $81.2 trillion in notional
contracts, according to the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency. New York-based Goldman Sachs was the second-biggest
with $39.9 trillion, followed by Bank of America Corp. with
$38.9 trillion and Citibank N.A. with $29.6 trillion. </p>
<p>The draft legislation would require the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
to set capital and margin requirements for non-bank swap dealers
and major swap participants that are as strict or
stricter than those set for U.S. depository institutions by
federal bank examiners, according to the proposal. </p>
<p>Hedge funds and private equity firms would be among the
hardest hit, said Karen Shaw Petrou, a managing partner at
research firm Federal Financial Analytics in Washington. Unlike
federally insured banks, hedge funds and other corporations
aren''t currently subject to capital standards. </p>
<p>A lot of the big counterparties, like AIG, lack the
capital to back their bets, Petrou said. </p>
<h2>Back Your Debts'' </h2>
<p>Hedge funds and private equity players would be the ones
for which the capital requirement would be the highest reach,
she said. It makes it hard to be a trader when you have to put
up capital to back your debts. </p>
<p>Derivatives are contracts used to hedge against changes in
stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities, interest rates and
weather. Credit-default swaps are derivatives created primarily
to protect lenders and bondholders from company defaults. </p>
<p>The Obama legislation sent to Capitol Hill yesterday
mirrors the administration''s preliminary proposals by asking
Congress to impose higher capital and margin requirements, move
most derivatives to regulated exchanges and clearinghouses and
impose supervision over all dealers. The legislation also aims
to better protect small municipalities and unsophisticated
investors by limiting their eligibility to trade derivatives. </p>
<p>The Justice Department is investigating at least seven
former JPMorgan bankers for possible violations for selling
unregulated derivatives to local governments, according to
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority records. Former bankers
from Wachovia Corp. and Bear Stearns Cos. are also under
investigation, according to filings with Finra, the largest
self-regulator for securities firms doing business in the U.S. </p>
<h2>Frank''s Support </h2>
<p>House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank, a
Massachusetts Democrat, told reporters last month he supports
proposals to restrict derivatives sales to municipalities. </p>
<p>Banks that are derivatives dealers and major market
participants would be regulated by federal banking agencies,
while non-bank investors would be regulated by the SEC and the
CFTC, according to the Treasury statement. The industry would be
subject to greater disclosure requirements, giving regulators
confidential access to data on transactions and open positions
and giving the public aggregate data and trading volumes. </p>
<p>What''s really starting to hit home is how bifurcated the
regulatory environment''s going to be for the OTC swap market,
said Kevin McPartland, a senior analyst in New York at TABB
Group, a financial-market research and advisory firm. The dual
regulators will create a reporting registration nightmare,
he said. </p>
<h2>Complicated and Costly'' </h2>
<p>Operationally and legally, at least for a few years, it
seems like it''s going to be complicated and costly, he said. </p>
<p>Congress, which is scheduled to return from recess on Sept.
8, must reconcile the Obama administration''s ideas with other
legislative proposals already under consideration. </p>
<p>Frank and House Agriculture Committee Chairman Collin Peterson, a Minnesota Democrat, have already embraced many of
Obama''s plans for derivatives markets, according to a three-page
proposal they released last month. Lawmakers still need to
decide how to split oversight and enforcement between the SEC
and CFTC. </p>
<p>Opaque financial products, including some derivatives,
contributed to almost $1.6 trillion in writedowns and losses at
the world''s biggest banks, brokers and insurers since the start
of 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. is trying to put
one over on you. </p>
<p>The world''s biggest publicly traded oil company wants you
to believe that it actually supports the fight against global
warming. But its tactics, which have been unfolding on opposite
sides of the globe, are just another recipe for cooking the
planet in three easy steps. </p>
<p>Exxon''s old formula wasn''t working anymore. The oil giant
used to bankroll scientists who claimed all that stuff about
starving polar bears and melting ice caps was just mumbo jumbo.
In a 1998 memo, the American Petroleum Institute -- the industry
group in which Exxon has long been dominant -- said it would
achieve victory when doubts about climate science become
part of the conventional wisdom.'' That helped create a
noisy minority of skeptics, but it won''t block climate
legislation forever. </p>
<p>So now Exxon is playing a more subtle game. It runs plenty
of ads featuring people in lab coats talking about clean energy.
It spent $15 million on Washington lobbyists in the first half
of this year -- more than all the solar and wind companies
combined. And it has created its new three-step program, which
is based on bad economics instead of shady science. </p>
<p>Step One: Gin up some frightening numbers, and use scare
tactics and lobbying muscle to kill the Obama administration''s
proposed mandatory cap on carbon emissions. </p>
<p>Job-Killer </p>
<p>As the U.S. Senate begins work on the climate-change bill,
which squeaked through the House of Representatives in June,
Exxon is among those denouncing the plan to cap emissions as a
stealth tax that would destroy jobs and drive up energy costs.
How does the oil producer know this? Because think tanks funded
by Exxon and others say so. </p>
<p>The company announced last year that it had stopped giving
money to global-warming skeptics who divert attention from
the need for clean energy. </p>
<p>Instead, it supports groups such as the American Council
for Capital Formation and the National Center for Policy
Analysis, which issue industry-friendly research. One study
released in May by the Heritage Foundation, which received at
least $50,000 from Exxon last year, claims that by putting a
price on carbon, the measure will kill millions of jobs and send
gasoline soaring. </p>
<p>The study has been criticized for making wildly pessimistic
economic assumptions -- no energy efficiency gains, no increased
use of renewables -- and for ignoring the bill''s many cost
containment provisions. The non-partisan Congressional Budget
Office found that middle-class households would pay only $175 a
year more in 2020 because of the legislation. </p>
<p>Doomsday Study </p>
<p>But let''s look closer. This doomsday study claims the
measure would drive gasoline prices to $4 a gallon -- in 2035!
If we don''t develop alternative energy, which is the whole point
of climate legislation, a gallon of gas will cost a lot more
than that in 25 years. The price of inaction is far higher than
the cost of acting now, though that''s not a discussion Exxon
wants to have. </p>
<p>Step Two: Organize demonstrations. On Aug. 18, about 3,500
people rallied in Houston against the bill -- the first of some
20 such Energy Citizen events sponsored by API and other
industry groups. The participants were energy industry workers,
many of whom wore T-shirts saying, I''ll Pass on $4 Gas. </p>
<p>How did they come to be there? A leaked memo from API
president Jack Gerard asked the group''s member companies to send
employees to the rallies to focus our message against
Waxman-Markey-like legislation, tax increases, and (energy)
access limitations. He also asked them to keep it quiet. </p>
<p>Legislative Caricature </p>
<p>Royal Dutch Shell and BP refused to participate in the
events because they support cap and trade, but Chevron,
ConocoPhillips and Anadarko Petroleum are involved, along with
more than 60 other businesses and associations. Exxon advised
its workers that attendance was at their own discretion and
not required, spokesman Rob Young told me, while saying that
Exxon opposes this deeply flawed legislation and agrees with
the rally''s job-killer message. How could it not? It helped pay
for studies that prove the point. </p>
<p>Step 3: Offer a seemingly sensible alternative policy.
Having caricatured the legislation, Exxon then offers a
compromise. That''s what it did in Australia earlier this month,
after the legislature shot down Prime Minister Kevin Rudd''s
climate proposal. Last week the chairman of Exxon''s Australian
unit, John Dashwood, called for replacing cap and trade with a
carbon tax. Echoing a January 2009 speech against cap and trade
by Chief Executive Rex Tillerson, Dashwood said the carbon tax
is more transparent to consumers, will achieve greater
environmental benefits and is more difficult to manipulate than
a cap-and-trade program. </p>
<p>Tax Without Change </p>
<p>Let''s get this straight. Exxon is demonstrating against a
climate bill in the U.S. because it is supposedly a hidden tax,
and on the other side of the globe it is lobbying for a tax.
This may seem contradictory, but it''s not. I believe the company
simply recognizes what so many others have missed in the debate
over the tax versus the cap: The cap requires economy-wide
emissions reductions, and the tax doesn''t. </p>
<p>Exxon doesn''t want to do business in a world where cuts in
carbon dioxide are mandatory. It would prefer to pay a modest
tax and keep on polluting. </p>
<p>A tax wouldn''t guarantee any carbon reductions, let alone
bring about the steep cuts needed to stave off the worst climate
changes. By calling for a small tax instead of a mandatory cap,
that''s exactly the kind of solution Exxon is proposing. </p>

<p>Australia approved Chevron Corp. (CVX)''s
A$50 billion ($42 billion) liquefied natural gas venture on a
remote island, adding stricter conditions to quell environmental
concerns about the nation''s biggest resources project. </p>
<p>The additional terms for the Gorgon project will enable it
to proceed within a nature reserve without unacceptable
impacts, Environment Minister Peter Garrett said in Canberra
today. Chevron has said the venture off the northwest shelf may
produce its first LNG in 2014. </p>
<p>The decision clears one of the final obstacles to Chevron,
Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) and Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) building the venture
on Barrow Island, 50 kilometers (32 miles) off the West
Australian coast. Gorgon has contracts to supply fuel to China,
India and Japan and is among more than 12 LNG projects in the
region competing for Asian buyers. </p>
<p>Gorgon is big and going to fill the available hole for
LNG demand, said Peter Arden, a Melbourne-based analyst at Ord
Minnett Ltd., an affiliate of JPMorgan Chase  Co. There''s a
case for some of the proposed projects that if they don''t move
quickly then it may get congested and some might not make it. </p>
<p>The Gorgon partners will make a development decision after
they win production licenses from the Australian government and
development approvals from the Western Australian state
government, Nicole Hodgson, a Chevron spokeswoman, said today in
an e-mailed response to questions. </p>
<h2>Australia''s LNG Ambition </h2>
<p>Combined with Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL)''s Pluto project due
to come on line in 2011, Gorgon would leapfrog Australia to
second place behind Qatar among global LNG producers. Australia
ranked sixth among LNG exporters in 2008, according to BP Plc''s
2009 statistical review of energy. </p>
<p>Gorgon will have capacity to produce 15 million metric tons
of LNG a year, according to Chevron. Current Australian LNG
output of 20 million tons a year may eventually reach 100
million tons, Peter Cleary, president of North West Shelf LNG,
said this month, more than double Qatar''s current output. </p>
<p>Environmentalists have opposed developing Gorgon and an oil
spill in the Timor Sea off the coast of Australia''s Kimberley
wilderness region five days ago renewed concerns over
exploration. </p>
<p>Australian Greens Senator Rachel Siewert attacked today''s
decision, claiming Garrett is signing off on the destruction
of this unique environment. </p>
<h2>Australia''s Ark'' </h2>
<p>Barrow Island is an A-Class Nature Reserve, Siewert
said in an e-mailed statement. It has been dubbed Australia''s
Ark'' for its unique range of endangered species. </p>
<p>The 202 square-kilometer (78 square-mile) island is a home
to flatback turtles, along with the burrowing bettong, a type of
small kangaroo that lives underground and has died out on the
mainland. The government describes flatbacks as vulnerable. </p>
<p>Chevron must submit plans for approval covering the
protection of animals such as the spectacled hare-wallaby, the
bettong and the golden bandicoot among 28 additional conditions
for the project, Garrett said today. </p>
<p>The San Ramon, California-based company must set up a
monitoring program to detect changes in the turtle population
and take measures to avoid impact on flatbacks, particularly
from light and noise, Garrett said. </p>
<p>The venture, which Chevron says has enough gas to last 40
years, will pipe the fuel to Barrow Island from 11 fields that
contain about 40 trillion cubic feet, Exxon says on its Web site. </p>
<h2>Carbon Capture </h2>
<p>Carbon dioxide generated as the gas is turned into liquid
form will be captured and stored underground, reducing
greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent, Chevron says on its Web
site. The federal and Western Australian governments have agreed
to jointly pay any long-term liability arising from this plan,
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said Aug. 17. </p>
<p>The ruling brings the three companies closer to building a
venture that on Aug. 18 secured Australia''s record export
contract with China at a time of tension between the countries.
PetroChina Co. will pay Irving, Texas-based Exxon $41 billion
over two decades for gas from Gorgon, the Australian government
said Aug. 18. </p>
<p>China''s detention of Rio Tinto Group executives last month
and a visit by Uighur leader Rebiya Kadeer to Australia have
strained relations between the two countries. Stern Hu, an
Australian passport holder, and three other Rio executives were
detained for allegedly stealing commercial secrets. </p>
<h2>PetroChina, Petronet </h2>
<p>Petronet LNG Ltd. (PLNG), India''s biggest importer of liquefied
natural gas, also signed an agreement with Exxon to buy 1.5
million metric tons of the fuel from Gorgon, the company said
Aug. 10 in a statement to the Bombay Stock Exchange. The venture
also has accords to supply the fuel to Japanese utilities Tokyo
Gas Co., Osaka Gas Co., and Chubu Electric Power Co. </p>
<p>Gorgon will generate about A$40 billion in revenue for the
Western Australian and federal governments that will be used to
build schools, hospitals and roads, Rudd said on Aug. 17. About
6,000 jobs will be created at the peak of construction, he said. </p>
<p>Western Australia will earn about A$100 million a year from
Gorgon revenue, state Premier Colin Barnett said today. </p>
<p>The Gorgon partners will buy about A$33 billion worth of
goods and services and sell LNG valued at around A$300 billion
to customers in the Asia-Pacific region over the next 20 years,
Rudd said. Chevron estimates the venture''s contribution to
Australia''s gross domestic product at A$64 billion, according to
its Web site. </p>
<p>Chevron and its venture partners applied to resources and
Energy Minister Martin Ferguson for production licenses on Aug.
18, Rudd said in Parliament on Aug 20. </p>
<h2>Timor Sea Spill </h2>
<p>The Gorgon Project has been deliberately sited to avoid
areas of particular conservation significance, Roy Krzywosinski, managing director of Chevron''s Australia unit,
said today in a statement. </p>
<p>Western Australian Premier Barnett made the A$50 billion
estimate of Gorgon''s construction costs in March, a figure that
would make it the country''s biggest resources project. The
venture has yet to release its own projection. </p>
<p>PTT Exploration  Production Pcl (PTTEP), Thailand''s only publicly
traded exploration company, said it may take 50 days to stop an
oil and gas leak about 250 kilometers from the coast in an area
some 800 kilometers north of Barrow Island. </p>
<p>LNG is natural gas that has been chilled to liquid form,
reducing it to one-six-hundredth of its original volume at minus
161 degrees Celsius (minus 259 Fahrenheit), for transportation
by ship to destinations not connected by pipeline. On arrival,
it''s turned back into gas for distribution to power plants,
factories and households. </p>

<p>Prosecutor Michael Loucks remembers
clearly when lawyers for Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s largest drug
company, looked across the table and promised it wouldn''t break
the law again. </p>
<p>It was January 2004, and the attorneys were negotiating in
a conference room on the ninth floor of the federal courthouse
in Boston, where Loucks was head of the health-care fraud unit
of the U.S. Attorney''s Office. One of Pfizer''s units had been
pushing doctors to prescribe an epilepsy drug called Neurontin
for uses the Food and Drug Administration had never approved. </p>
<p>In the agreement the lawyers eventually hammered out, the
Pfizer unit, Warner-Lambert, pleaded guilty to two felony counts
of marketing a drug for unapproved uses. </p>
<p>New York-based Pfizer agreed to pay $430 million in
criminal fines and civil penalties, and the company''s lawyers
assured Loucks and three other prosecutors that Pfizer and its
units would stop promoting drugs for unauthorized purposes. </p>
<p>What Loucks, who''s now acting U.S. attorney in Boston,
didn''t know until years later was that Pfizer managers were
breaking that pledge not to practice so-called off-label
marketing even before the ink was dry on their plea. </p>
<p>On the morning of Sept. 2, 2009, another Pfizer unit,
Pharmacia  Upjohn, agreed to plead guilty to the same crime.
This time, Pfizer executives had been instructing more than 100
salespeople to promote Bextra, a drug approved only for the
relief of arthritis and menstrual discomfort, for treatment of
acute pains of all kinds. </p>
<h2>Record High Fine </h2>
<p>For this new felony, Pfizer paid the largest criminal fine
in U.S. history: $1.19 billion. On the same day, it paid $1
billion to settle civil cases involving the off-label promotion
of Bextra and three other drugs with the U.S. and 49 states. </p>
<p>At the very same time Pfizer was in our office
negotiating and resolving the allegations of criminal conduct in
2004, Pfizer was itself in its other operations violating those
very same laws, Loucks, 54, says. They''ve repeatedly
marketed drugs for things they knew they couldn''t demonstrate
efficacy for. That''s clearly criminal. </p>
<p>The penalties Pfizer paid this year for promoting Bextra
off-label were the latest chapter in the drug''s benighted
history. The FDA found Bextra to be so dangerous that Pfizer
took it off the market for all uses in 2005. </p>
<p>Across the U.S., pharmaceutical companies have been
pleading guilty to criminal charges or paying penalties in civil
cases when the U.S. Department of Justice finds that they
deceptively marketed drugs for unapproved uses, putting millions
of people at risk of chest infections, heart attacks, suicidal
impulses or death. </p>
<h2>$7 Billion in Penalties </h2>
<p>Since May 2004, Pfizer, Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY), Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co. and four other drug companies have paid a total of $7
billion in fines and penalties. Six of the companies admitted in
court that they marketed medicines for unapproved uses. </p>
<p>In September 2007, New York-based Bristol-Myers (BMY) paid $515
million -- without admitting or denying wrongdoing -- to federal
and state governments in a civil lawsuit brought by the Justice
Department. The six other companies pleaded guilty in criminal
cases. </p>
<p>In January 2009, Indianapolis-based Lilly, the largest U.S.
psychiatric drug maker, pleaded guilty and paid $1.42 billion in
fines and penalties to settle charges that it had for at least
four years illegally marketed Zyprexa, a drug approved for the
treatment of schizophrenia, as a remedy for dementia in elderly
patients. </p>
<p>In five company-sponsored clinical trials, 31 people out of
1,184 participants died after taking the drug for dementia --
twice the death rate for those taking a placebo. Those findings
were reported in an October 2005 article in the Journal of the
American Medical Association. </p>
<h2>Don''t Respect the Law'' </h2>
<p>Marketing departments of many drug companies don''t
respect any boundaries of professionalism or the law, says
Jerry Avorn, a professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston and
author of Powerful Medicines: The Benefits, Risks, and Costs
of Prescription Drugs (Random House, 2004). The Pfizer and
Lilly cases involved the illegal promotion of drugs that have
been shown to cause substantial harm and death to patients. </p>
<p>The widespread off-label promotion of drugs is yet another
manifestation of a health-care system that has become
dysfunctional. </p>
<p>It''s an unbearable cost to a system that''s going broke,
says Avorn, who heads the pharmacology economics unit of Brigham
and Women''s Hospital in Boston. We can''t even afford to pay
for effective, safe therapies. </p>
<h2>10 Million Prescriptions </h2>
<p>About 15 percent of all drug sales in the U.S. are for
unapproved uses without adequate evidence the medicines work,
according to a study by Randall Stafford, a medical professor at
Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. </p>
<p>He estimates that doctors write more than 10 million such
prescriptions each year. </p>
<p>As large as the penalties are for drug companies caught
breaking the off-label law, the fines are tiny compared with the
firms'' annual revenues. </p>
<p>The $2.3 billion in fines and penalties Pfizer paid for
marketing Bextra and three other drugs cited in the Sept. 2 plea
agreement for off-label uses amount to just 14 percent of its
$16.8 billion in revenue from selling those medicines from 2001
to 2008. </p>
<p>The total of $2.75 billion Pfizer has paid in off-label
penalties since 2004 is a little more than 1 percent of the
company''s revenue of $245 billion from 2004 to 2008. </p>
<h2>$36 Billion in Revenue </h2>
<p>Lilly already had a criminal conviction for misbranding a
drug when it broke the law again in promoting schizophrenia drug
Zyprexa for off-label uses starting in 1999. The medication
provided Lilly with $36 billion in revenue from 2000 to 2008. </p>
<p>That''s more than 25 times as much as the total penalties
Lilly paid in January. </p>
<p>Companies regard the risk of multimillion-dollar penalties
as just another cost of doing business, says Lon Schneider, a
professor at the University of Southern California''s Keck School
of Medicine in Los Angeles. </p>
<p>In 2006, he led a study for the National Institute of
Mental Health of off-label use of drugs, including Zyprexa, for
the treatment of Alzheimer''s disease. </p>
<p>There''s an unwritten business plan, he says. They''re
drivers that knowingly speed. If stopped, they pay the fine, and
then they do it again. </p>
<h2>Shareholders Unmoved </h2>
<p>Schneider has been paid both by Lilly as a consultant and
by plaintiffs suing the company. </p>
<p>Big Pharma''s off-label transgressions didn''t trigger a rush
for the doors by shareholders. From Jan. 26, when Pfizer
announced that it would pay billions in penalties, to Oct. 12,
Pfizer''s share price increased 9.3 percent, just shy of the
11.2 percent rise in the Standard  Poor''s 500 Health Care
Index. </p>
<p>From Oct. 21, 2008, when Lilly said it would pay its
penalties, to Oct. 12, the company''s stock value went up 0.6
percent; the SP index gained 6.9 percent in that time. </p>
<p>In pushing off-label use of drugs, companies find ready and
willing partners in physicians. Under the fragmented system of
medical regulation in the U.S., it''s legal for doctors to
prescribe FDA-approved drugs for any use. </p>
<p>The FDA has no authority over doctors, only over drug
companies, regarding off-label practices. It''s up to the 50
states to oversee physicians. </p>
<p>I think the physician community has to take some
ownership responsibility and do their own due diligence beyond
the sales and marketing person, says Boston''s former U.S.
Attorney Michael Sullivan. </p>
<h2>Off-Label Benefits </h2>
<p>Loucks says prosecutors realize that patients can benefit
when doctors use drugs for off-label purposes based on science
and not on false marketing claims. </p>
<p>Doctors generally don''t tell people that they''re
prescribing drugs pitched to them by pharmaceutical salespeople
for unapproved treatments, says Peter Lurie, deputy medical
director of Public Citizen, a Washington-based public interest
group. </p>
<p>Most physicians don''t keep track of FDA-approved uses of
drugs, says Lurie, a physician who has published articles in
The Lancet and the Journal of the American Medical
Association. </p>
<p>The great majority of doctors have no idea; they don''t
even understand the distinction between on- and off-labeling,
Lurie says. </p>
<p>Pharmaceutical companies have showered doctors with cash to
persuade them to use drugs off-label, according to their guilty
pleas. </p>
<h2>Buying Access'' </h2>
<p>Pfizer''s marketing program offered doctors up to $1,000 a
day to allow a Pfizer salesperson to spend time with the
physician and his patients, according to a whistle-blower
lawsuit filed by John Kopchinski, who worked as a salesman at
Pfizer from 1992 to 2003. </p>
<p>By pairing up'' with a physician, the sales
representative was able to promote over a period of many hours,
without the usual problems of gaining access to prescribing
physicians, Kopchinski says. In essence, this amounted to
Pfizer buying access to physicians. </p>
<p>Pfizer spokesman Chris Loder says the company stopped what
it calls mentorships in 2005. He says Pfizer paid doctors
$250 per visit. </p>
<p>It used to be legal for companies to promote drugs for any
use in the U.S. Congress banned the practice in 1962. The
catalyst was Thalidomide, a morning sickness drug taken by
pregnant women outside the U.S. that caused severe birth
defects. </p>
<h2>Recouping Investments </h2>
<p>The 1962 law required pharmaceutical companies to prove
their drugs were safe and effective for specific uses. Before
that, a drug company could market an approved medicine for any
illness. </p>
<p>If the law is clear, why do drug companies keep breaking
it? The answer lies in economics. Pharmaceutical companies spend
about $1 billion to develop and test a new drug. To recoup their
investment, the companies want doctors to prescribe their drugs
as widely as possible. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s Neurontin is a case in point. The FDA approved the
drug as a supplemental medication in treating epilepsy in 1993.
Pfizer took in $2.27 billion from sales of Neurontin in 2002. A
full 94 percent -- $2.12 billion -- of that revenue came from
off-label use, according to the prosecutors'' 2004 Pfizer
sentencing memo. </p>
<p>Pfizer, which bought Wyeth on Oct. 15 for $68 billion, put
itself at the center of illegal off-label drug marketing with an
acquisition frenzy a decade earlier. From 1995 to 2005, Pfizer
purchased more than 20 companies. </p>
<h2>Guilty Pleas </h2>
<p>Since 2004, companies that are now Pfizer divisions have
pleaded guilty to off-label marketing of two drugs. Pfizer
continued off-label promotions for these medications after
buying the firms, according to Pfizer''s Sept. 2 guilty plea and
FDA correspondence with Pfizer. </p>
<p>Pfizer first stepped into an off-label scheme in 1999, when
it offered to buy Morris Plains, New Jersey-based Warner-Lambert
Co. Prosecutors charged that Warner-Lambert marketed Neurontin
off-label between 1995 and 1999. </p>
<p>Warner-Lambert admitted doing so for one year in a May 2004
guilty plea for which Pfizer paid $430 million in fines and
penalties. </p>
<p>Neurontin, which was invented by Warner-Lambert, was first
tested in humans in 1987. When the FDA approved it in 1993 to be
used only along with other epilepsy drugs, the agency wrote that
a side effect of the drug can be that it induces depression and
suicidal thoughts in patients. </p>
<h2>Whistle-Blower </h2>
<p>Much of what prosecutors learned about Warner-Lambert''s
marketing of Neurontin comes from a former employee. </p>
<p>David Franklin, who holds a Ph.D. in microbiology from the
University of Rhode Island, left his job as a pediatric
researcher at Harvard University''s Dana-Farber Cancer Institute
in 1996 to work for the Parke-Davis unit of Warner-Lambert in
Boston. </p>
<p>He says he hoped the salary boost -- to $55,000 annually
from $18,000 -- would help him pay off student loans and better
support his family. </p>
<p>Franklin''s title at Warner-Lambert was medical liaison. He
says he soon realized his new employer viewed his doctorate as a
badge that would allow him to strike up conversations with
physicians. </p>
<p>Franklin, 48, says his job involved more salesmanship than
science. He told doctors that Neurontin was the best drug for a
dozen off-label uses, including pain relief, bipolar disease and
depression. </p>
<h2>What I Did Was Wrong'' </h2>
<p>Technically, I had responsibility for answering physician
questions about all of Parke-Davis''s drugs, Franklin says.
In practice, my real job was to promote Neurontin for off-label indications heavily -- to the exclusion of just about
everything else. </p>
<p>Franklin, whose wife is a lawyer, says he knew such uses of
the drug had no scientific support for effectiveness and safety. </p>
<p>I was actually undermining their ability to fulfill the
Hippocratic oath, Franklin says, referring to a physician''s
pledge to first, do no harm. </p>
<p>Franklin says he was horrified when he learned from a
doctor that a child had a behavioral outburst at school for the
first time after taking Neurontin. </p>
<p>Don''t we have an obligation to tell physicians about
this? Franklin says he asked his manager, Phil Magistro. His
boss tried to reassure him, Franklin says. </p>
<h2>Total Disregard'' </h2>
<p>Don''t worry about this stuff,'' he says Magistro told
him. It can never get back to us.'' </p>
<p>Franklin was stunned. </p>
<p>I realized at that moment, looking into his eyes, that
there was an absolute total disregard for the patient, he
says. </p>
<p>Magistro, who now works at drug marketing adviser Atom
Strategic Consulting LLC in Randolph, New Jersey, didn''t return
calls seeking comment. </p>
<p>Franklin saved phone messages from Magistro to his sales
team urging them to market Neurontin for off-label uses,
including pain relief. During one such call, on May 23, 1996, at
5:48 p.m. in Boston, Magistro told his staff, You''re supposed
to be pushing on Neurontin, according to a transcript of the
tape filed in federal court. </p>
<p>When we get out there, we want to kick some ass. We want
to sell Neurontin on pain, Magistro said. All right? </p>
<h2>Quit the Job </h2>
<p>After working for Warner-Lambert for three months, Franklin
grew concerned about his own liability. He quit the job and
talked with Boston attorney Thomas Greene, who helped him file a
lawsuit against the company. </p>
<p>Franklin acted as a whistle-blower, suing on behalf of
taxpayers to recover money the government paid for illegally
promoted drugs. Under federal and state whistle-blower statutes,
he stood to collect as much as 30 percent of any settlement the
company made with the government. </p>
<p>Franklin had to wait four years -- until 2000 -- before the
Justice Department began a criminal investigation. In November
1999, Pfizer made its public offer to buy Warner-Lambert. In
January 2000, a federal grand jury in Boston issued subpoenas to
Warner-Lambert employees to testify about the marketing of
Neurontin. </p>
<p>That March, Warner-Lambert''s annual report disclosed that
prosecutors were building a criminal case. Undeterred, Pfizer
bought Warner-Lambert in June for $87 billion. It was the third-largest merger in U.S. history. </p>
<h2>Misleading and in Violation'' </h2>
<p>A year after the acquisition, the FDA discovered that
Neurontin was still being marketed off-label. In a letter to
the company on June 29, 2001, the agency wrote that Pfizer''s
promotion of the drug is misleading and in violation of the
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act. </p>
<p>The agency asked Pfizer to stop such promotions of
Neurontin. The FDA said Pfizer had distributed brochures --
known as slim jims because they''re small enough to put in a
jacket pocket -- improperly claiming that the drug could improve
energy levels and memory. </p>
<p>Immediately discontinue the use of this slim jim and any
other promotional material or practices with the same or similar
messages, the FDA wrote. </p>
<p>Pfizer marketed Neurontin off-label after receiving that
letter, agency records show. For 2001, Pfizer reported revenue
of $1.75 billion from Neurontin sales, making it the company''s
fourth-largest-selling drug that year, ahead of impotence pill
Viagra, which Neurontin topped for four years. </p>
<h2>Marketing Violated Rules </h2>
<p>As Neurontin sales soared to $2.27 billion in 2002, the FDA
found that Pfizer was improperly claiming that the drug was
useful for a broader range of brain disorders than scientific
evidence had established. </p>
<p>The agency sent a letter dated July 1, 2002, that said the
company''s marketing practices were in violation of FDA rules. It
asked Pfizer to stop using misleading promotions. Pfizer
reported $2.7 billion in revenue from Neurontin in 2003.
Overall, the drug has provided Pfizer with $12 billion in
revenue. </p>
<p>In a response to Bloomberg News, Pfizer spokesman Chris
Loder said, Regarding the 2001 and 2002 FDA letters, we do not
believe that they were suggestive of any continuing off-label
promotion. </p>
<p>For blowing the whistle on his employer, Franklin collected
$24.6 million under the False Claims Act. </p>
<p>Prosecutors Loucks and Sullivan got involved in the case
after Franklin filed his suit, relying on information from
Franklin and their own investigation. Before 2004, prosecutions
for off-label marketing were rare. </p>
<h2>Everybody Does It'' </h2>
<p>Until a couple of these cases became public, companies
were probably saying, Everybody does it this way,'' Sullivan
says. </p>
<p>Loucks had a track record in off-label prosecutions. He
gave up private practice at Choate Hall  Stewart LLP in Boston
in 1985 to join the U.S. Attorney''s Office. </p>
<p>In 1994, he negotiated a $61 million settlement with Murray
Hill, New Jersey-based C.R. Bard Inc., which pleaded guilty to
promoting off-label use of a heart catheter that led to patient
deaths. </p>
<p>In 2002, he co-authored, with Carol Lam, Prosecuting and
Defending Health Care Fraud Cases (BNA Books). </p>
<p>In the January 2004 settlement negotiations with Loucks,
Sullivan and two other prosecutors, Pfizer''s lawyers assured the
U.S. Attorney''s Office that the company wouldn''t market drugs
off-label. </p>
<h2>Those Promises'' </h2>
<p>They asserted that the company understood the rules and
had taken steps to assure corporate compliance with the law,
Loucks says. We remember those promises. </p>
<p>What Pfizer''s lawyers didn''t tell the prosecutors was that
Pfizer was at that moment running an off-label marketing
promotion using more than 100 of its salespeople. They were
pitching Bextra, a Pfizer sales manager admitted when she
pleaded guilty to misbranding a drug on March 30, 2009. </p>
<p>Jeff Kindler, who became Pfizer''s general counsel in 2002,
supervised the lawyers who made the promises to prosecutors. By
2004, Kindler increased the compliance budget 12-fold. He became
chief executive officer in 2006. In Pfizer''s ethics guide,
he says stories about misbehaving companies and executives
abound. </p>
<p>Pfizer truly stands apart, he says. I am proud of our
record. On Oct. 1, Kindler was elected to the board of the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Kindler declined to comment. </p>
<p>Peapack, New Jersey-based Pharmacia  Upjohn Inc. developed
Bextra, which was approved by the FDA only for the treatment of
arthritis and menstrual discomfort in 2001. </p>
<h2>Sales Manager Pleads Guilty </h2>
<p>PU and Pfizer had by then already crafted a joint
marketing agreement to sell the drug. In November 2001, Mary
Holloway, a Pfizer regional manager for the Northeastern U.S.,
began illegally training and directing her sales team to market
Bextra for the relief of acute pain, Holloway admitted in a
March 2009 guilty plea. </p>
<p>On Dec. 4, 2001, Pfizer executives sent Holloway a copy of
a nonpublic letter from the FDA to the company. The agency had
denied Pfizer''s application to market Bextra for acute pain.
Clinical trials had shown Bextra could cause heart damage and
death. </p>
<p>Pfizer bought Pharmacia  Upjohn in April 2003. From 2001
to the end of 2003, PU, first as an independent company and
then as a unit of Pfizer, paid physicians more than $5 million
in cash to lure them to resorts, where salespeople illegally
pitched off-label uses for Bextra, PU admitted in its Sept. 2
guilty plea. </p>
<h2>Golf, Massages'' </h2>
<p>Pharmacia paid targeted physicians both airfare and two
to three days'' accommodations at lavish resorts in the Bahamas,
Virgin Islands and across the United States and further
entertained these physicians with golf, massages and other
recreation activities, according to prosecutors'' findings. </p>
<p>In her guilty plea, Holloway said her team had solicited
hospitals to create protocols to buy Bextra for the unapproved
purpose of acute pain relief. Her representatives didn''t mention
the increased risk of heart attacks in their marketing. </p>
<p>They told doctors that side effects were no worse than
those of a sugar pill, Holloway admitted in her guilty plea. </p>
<p>In 2003, Holloway reported her unit''s off-label promotions
of Bextra up the corporate ladder at Pfizer, according to a pre-sentencing memo to the judge written by Robert Ullmann,
Holloway''s attorney. Top managers didn''t attempt to halt the
illegal conduct, the memo said. </p>
<p>Corporate tracked this information, and at no time did it
inform Ms. Holloway that any of the reported protocols were
inappropriate, he wrote. Instead, the instruction was to get
more protocols. </p>
<h2>Blockbuster Status </h2>
<p>By the end of 2004, Bextra reached blockbuster status, with
annual sales of $1.29 billion. Holloway promoted Bextra until
the FDA asked Pfizer in April 2005 to pull it from the market
for all uses, evidence in her case shows. </p>
<p>The agency concluded that the drug increased the risk of
heart attacks, chest infections and strokes in cardiac surgery
patients. In June 2009, Holloway, 47, was sentenced to two years
on probation and fined $75,000. She didn''t return phone calls
seeking comment. </p>
<p>Ronald Rainero, a Pfizer district sales manager and
employee for more than 20 years, says he was responsible for
promoting Bextra in New York from 2001 to 2005. In September
2007, Rainero, 47, began cooperating with federal prosecutors on
the Bextra case. </p>
<h2>Hotel Meetings </h2>
<p>He says he met monthly with his fellow managers at a Hilton
hotel in Staten Island, New York, to discuss sales methods of
promoting Bextra off-label. As a whistle-blower, Rainero was
awarded $9.3 million as part of the September settlement. </p>
<p>In the same time period that Pfizer was marketing Bextra
off-label, the company''s sales force was promoting another drug,
Zyvox, improperly, Pfizer admitted at the time of its September
plea agreement. </p>
<p>Zyvox was approved in 2000 by the FDA for treating MRSA-caused pneumonia and skin infections. Raniero told federal
prosecutors that Pfizer began the Zyvox campaign in 2001. The
company admitted to falsely claiming that the drug was better
than other medications for treating MRSA pneumonia. </p>
<p>Pfizer told doctors to use Zyvox rather than vancomycin, a
generic antibiotic that cost $18 a day. Pfizer sold Zyvox for
about $150 a day. A table on page 30 of a 35-page fact book
produced by Pfizer for Zyvox says the drug is less effective
than vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia. </p>
<h2>Misleading Promotion'' </h2>
<p>On July 20, 2005, the FDA sent a letter to Hank McKinnell,
then Pfizer''s CEO, saying, Your misleading promotion of Zyvox,
and in particular your unsubstantiated implied claims regarding
its superiority to vancomycin, poses serious health and safety
concerns. </p>
<p>The agency ordered the company to stop the promotion. In
response, Pfizer told the FDA it would stop saying Zyvox was
more effective against MRSA pneumonia than vancomycin. </p>
<p>Despite its 2005 pledge to the FDA, Pfizer continued to
tell hospitals and doctors that Zyvox would save more lives than
vancomycin, the company admitted in the September settlement. </p>
<p>By 2007, the criminal and civil cases against Pfizer, its
employees and its subsidiaries had started to mount. The tally
of drugs cited by federal prosecutors for off-label promotion
reached six by 2009. In April 2007, PU pleaded guilty to a
felony charge of offering a $12 million kickback to a pharmacy
benefit manager. </p>
<h2>$2.2 Billion in Penalties </h2>
<p>Pfizer paid a criminal fine of $19.7 million. Thomas
Farina, a Pfizer district sales manager, was convicted in
federal court in March 2009 for destroying records during the
Bextra investigation. Farina, 42, was sentenced to three years
on probation, including six months of home confinement. He
didn''t return calls seeking comment. </p>
<p>Pfizer itself was called to account on Sept. 2, when it
agreed to pay the $2.2 billion in fines and penalties. PU
pleaded guilty to a felony charge of misbranding Bextra with the
intent to defraud. After the settlement, Pfizer general counsel
Amy Schulman said the company had learned its lesson. </p>
<p>We regret certain actions we''ve taken in the past, she
said. Corporate integrity is an absolute priority for
Pfizer. </p>
<p>One reason drug companies keep breaking the law may be
because prosecutors and judges have been unwilling to use the
ultimate sanction -- a felony conviction that would render a
company''s drugs ineligible for reimbursement by state health
programs and federal Medicare. </p>
<p>It''s potentially a death sentence for a drug company,
prosecutor Sullivan says. </p>
<h2>Fig Leaf </h2>
<p>A legal fig leaf allows a parent company to continue to
participate in government programs even after its subsidiary has
pleaded guilty. </p>
<p>Pfizer maintains its good standing with such agencies
because its subsidiaries, Warner-Lambert and PU, and not the
corporation itself, entered the guilty pleas to felony charges. </p>
<p>A felony conviction of a pharmaceutical giant could lead to
disaster for shareholders, Loucks says, adding that''s a step
that may have to be taken for repeat offenders. </p>
<p>I think it''s something the trigger will get pulled on,
he says from his ninth-floor office in the federal courthouse,
with a sweeping view of Boston Harbor. It''s just a question of
when. </p>
<p>At Pfizer''s Pharmacia sentencing on Oct. 16., U.S. District
Court Judge Douglas Woodlock said companies don''t appear to take
the law seriously. </p>
<p>It has become something of a cost of doing business for
some of these corporations, to shed their skin like certain
animals and leave the skin and move on, he said. </p>
<h2>Eli Lilly </h2>
<p>Lilly''s rap sheet goes back to 1985. That''s when the
company pleaded guilty to 25 federal misdemeanor charges related
to its misbranding of Oraflex, an arthritis drug. </p>
<p>Lilly stopped selling the drug four months after U.S. sales
began in 1982, following the company''s failure to tell the FDA
about illnesses and deaths tied to the medication. Lilly paid a
$25,000 fine. </p>
<p>Twenty years later, in 2005, Lilly paid $36 million in a
guilty plea to one federal misdemeanor for off-label marketing
of Evista, a drug the FDA had approved for bone strengthening. </p>
<p>In 1997, the agency had rejected Lilly''s application to
market the drug to reduce the risk of breast cancer. Yet
beginning the next year, Lilly adopted an Evista marketing plan
that included a seminar with doctors designed to appeal to
women''s breast cancer concerns, Lilly admitted in its 2005
guilty plea. </p>
<p>In 2007, the FDA approved Evista for preventing breast
cancer in two limited groups. </p>
<h2>Back in Court </h2>
<p>In January 2009, Lilly was back in federal court.
Prosecutors in Philadelphia accused the company of earning
hundreds of millions of dollars by illegally promoting its
schizophrenia drug Zyprexa for the unapproved treatment of
dementia from 1999 to at least 2003. </p>
<p>In 2001, Lilly''s senior management decided not to seek FDA
approval for Zyprexa to treat dementia because of what they
viewed as mixed results in clinical trials and safety risks,
according to admissions by Lilly in its 2009 guilty plea. In its
marketing, Lilly promoted the drug as effective. </p>
<p>Zyprexa has been Lilly''s best-selling drug for the past
decade. </p>
<p>Eli Lilly undertook this illegal off-label promotion for
its own financial gain despite the potential risk to patients''
health and lives, prosecutors wrote in their sentencing memo. </p>
<p>Lilly Chairman and CEO John Lechleiter said after the
settlement that the company was devoted to acting responsibly. </p>
<h2>Deeply Regret'' </h2>
<p>We deeply regret the past actions covered by the
misdemeanor plea, he said. Doing the right thing is
nonnegotiable at Lilly. </p>
<p>In a written response to questions from Bloomberg News,
Lilly said, Lilly entered into a very narrow guilty plea. Even
though the company disagrees with and does not admit to the
allegations, Lilly agreed to settle the dispute. </p>
<p>Lilly paid $1.42 billion for a fine and penalties in the
January settlement with federal and state governments. That
included the largest criminal fine in U.S. history -- until
Pfizer pleaded guilty in September. </p>
<p>The Justice Department could have charged Lilly with a
felony. Prosecutors decided that it wouldn''t be fair to innocent
Lilly employees, shareholders and pensioners to potentially shut
down the company, according to the sentencing memo. </p>
<h2>All the Factors'' </h2>
<p>The government considered all the factors in its
decision, prosecutors wrote. Those factors included other
persons not proven personally culpable. </p>
<p>Federal regulators have detected a similar pattern of
dishonesty by other pharmaceutical firms. Schering-Plough Corp.
drug salesmen pitched off-label uses of a cancer drug called
Temodar at the American Society of Clinical Oncology''s annual
conference in San Francisco in May 2001. </p>
<p>Schering-Plough representatives said Temodar compared
favorably to a placebo in clinical trials for the off-label uses
and was approved by the FDA for first-line use in treating brain
tumors. </p>
<p>An FDA employee attending the conference took note. The
next month, the FDA accused Schering of lying. </p>
<p>There had been no such clinical trials and the agency had
not approved Temodar as the salespeople had claimed, the FDA
said in a June 28, 2001, letter to Mary Jane Nehring, Schering''s
senior director of marketed products. The agency ordered the
company to immediately cease illegal promotion of Temodar. </p>
<p>Kenilworth, New Jersey-based Schering-Plough was quick to
respond. On July 12, 2001, it wrote back to the FDA, assuring
regulators that the San Francisco activity was an isolated
incident. </p>
<h2>Certainly Inconsistent'' </h2>
<p>It was certainly inconsistent with the direction provided
by the home office, the drug company wrote, according to
prosecutor''s records. </p>
<p>The FDA told Schering-Plough three weeks later that it had
closed its investigation. </p>
<p>Schering-Plough didn''t stop pitching the drug for
unapproved uses. At the direction of top management, Schering
ordered widespread off-label marketing of Temodar and Intron A,
another cancer drug, until December 2003, the company admitted
in an August 2006 guilty plea. </p>
<p>Schering, which agreed in March to be acquired by Merck 
Co., earned a pre-tax profit of $124.2 million from the illegal
sales after promising the FDA in 2001 it would stop marketing
for off-label uses, the company admitted. </p>
<p>Schering-Plough pleaded guilty in August 2006 to conspiring
to make false statements to the FDA. The company agreed to pay
$435 million to settle the case. </p>
<h2>Upsetting to Me'' </h2>
<p>U.S. District Court Judge Patti Saris, who had presided
over the Neurontin whistle-blower case before the Pfizer probe,
accepted Schering''s plea in her Boston courtroom in January
2007. She expressed dismay with the drug industry. </p>
<p>It''s been upsetting to me how many of the big
pharmaceutical companies have engaged in what I view as clearly
illegal behavior in terms of off-label marketing, she said.
It almost seems as if the pharmaceutical companies said Yeah,
yeah, yeah'' to the FDA and then went and did it anyway. </p>
<p>Brent Saunders, a Schering-Plough senior vice president,
said after the settlement that his company had made great
progress in putting integrity at the center of its work. </p>
<p>With this agreement, we are putting issues from the past
behind us, he said. Schering declined to comment further. </p>
<p>As prosecutors continue to uncover patterns of deceit in
off-label marketing by pharmaceutical companies, millions of
patients across the nation remain in the dark. Doctors often
choose the medications based on dishonest marketing by drug
company salesmen. </p>
<h2>A Morass'' </h2>
<p>It''s a morass of undifferentiated information out
there, Public Citizen''s Lurie says. And the doctors, let
alone patients, aren''t able to distinguish the good from the
bad. </p>
<p>One thing all people should do, Lurie says, is ask whether
their prescriptions are for FDA-approved uses, and if not,
whether strong evidence supports using the drug, particularly if
it can be dangerous. </p>
<p>Loucks says that putting an end to the criminal off-label
schemes by the pharmaceutical industry is more difficult. As
drugmakers repeatedly plead guilty, they''ve shown they''re
willing to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in fines as a
cost of generating billions in revenue. </p>
<p>The best hope, Loucks says, is that drug companies actually
honor the promises they keep making -- and keep breaking -- to
obey the law of the land. </p>

<p>So now we know the value Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. places on salving its conscience for screwing
up what Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein called God''s
work. It seems that $500 million is all it takes to compensate
the world for Goldman''s role in creating the credit crunch. </p>
<p>Goldman said yesterday it''s setting up a 10,000 Small
Businesses Initiative. It will shell out $200 million to
educational institutions to help guide business owners, with a
further $300 million invested for lending and philanthropy aimed
at community development groups. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is the largest Goldman
shareholder, is joining the initiative. </p>
<p>Here''s another way of looking at this sudden burst of
supposed generosity. Goldman has $16.7 billion stashed in its
bonus pot from the record profit earned in the first nine months
of the year, which works out at $527,192 per staffer. </p>
<p>That means those 10,000 small businesses the securities
firm says it wants to help are worth the equivalent of about
1,000 Goldman employees. Alternatively, a Goldmanite''s average
contribution to society is pitched at the equivalent of 10 small
enterprises, based on that bonus-versus-charity calculation. </p>
<p>False Gods </p>
<p>Even at the Stakhanovite work rates the firm legendarily
squeezes out of its staff, that''s quite a stretch. The idea that
one banker is worth 10 businesses is the kind of math that got
us into this mess, with finance falsely elevated until it became
an end in itself, rather than a means to providing services to
the real economy. </p>
<p>The public isn''t likely to fall for this charade. The
financial community has already spent too many years parading
its charitable contributions to help divert attention from its
risk-taking adventures. Tax-deductible gestures are no longer
sufficient to comfort those who have seen their pension pots
devastated by the credit crisis; even with this year''s rallies,
the total value of the major global stock exchanges is still a
bit less than $45 trillion, down from a peak of almost $62
trillion at the end of 2007, before the subprime meltdown
wrecked the global economy. </p>
<p>Potentially more valuable than the charity fig-leaf is the
apology Blankfein made yesterday. We participated in things
that were clearly wrong and have reason to regret, Blankfein,
55, said at a conference in New York hosted by a magazine called
Directorship. It would be nice to think that banking chiefs
truly -- albeit very belatedly -- recognize that their reckless
propagation of alchemical securities must never be repeated. </p>
<p>Fawning Adoration </p>
<p>Blankfein''s apology might ring truer, however, if he hadn''t
been named CEO of the year by the magazine whose conference he
was gracing with his presence. The fawning adoration for the
multimillionaires who run the banking industry has only been
diminished, not destroyed, by the damage their actions wrought. </p>
<p>If he worked for anyone other than Goldman Sachs, Blankfein
would probably be out of a job by now. His remark earlier this
month to the Sunday Times magazine that bankers are doing
God''s work is the kind of indiscretion that loses you the key
to the executive bathroom at most public companies. </p>
<p>No matter how many charitable donations it makes, Goldman
will struggle to shake off the moniker bestowed on it by Matt
Taibbi in Rolling Stone magazine earlier this year. Taibbi
described the firm as a great vampire squid wrapped around the
face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into
anything that smells like money. Goldman and its peers need to
practice humility and contriteness for an extended period,
rather than seeking image-buffing headlines with token gestures. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the most
profitable securities firm in Wall Street history, hired back
Kasper Christoffersen almost two years after he left to join a
hedge fund in London. </p>
<p>Christoffersen, 36, starts Dec. 1 in London as a managing
director and co-head of the European investment-grade syndicate
group with Ian Gilday, said Michael DuVally, a spokesman for
Goldman Sachs in New York. Gilday will continue running the
European high-yield and loan capital markets syndicate division. </p>
<p>Christoffersen, a Danish national, ran European government
bond trading at Goldman Sachs before leaving in early 2008 for
Autonomy Capital Research LLP, a hedge-fund firm founded in 2003
by former Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. trader Robert Gibbins. A
year ago, Autonomy halted withdrawals from its $1.2 billion
flagship Autonomy Capital Fund after slumping about 40 percent
in the year. </p>
<p>At Goldman Sachs, Christoffersen and Gilday, who are both
based in London, will report to Jim Esposito, the New York-based
global head of investment-grade and municipal financing, and to
Francois Xavier de Mallmann, who runs the European financing
group from London, DuVally said. Goldman Sachs''s financing group
operates as a joint venture between the investment banking and
sales and trading departments. </p>

<p>General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP) plans
to emerge from bankruptcy without selling its best-performing
shopping malls after reaching agreement with lenders, a strategy
that may thwart the acquisition ambitions of competitor Simon
Property Group Inc. General Growth rose 15 percent. </p>
<p>I would not be surprised to see the odd sale of an asset,
but it won''t be to raise substantial capital, General Growth
President and Chief Operating Officer Thomas Nolan said
yesterday in a telephone interview. We have no current plans
to sell any of those assets we consider to be strategically
important. </p>
<p>General Growth, the second-largest U.S. mall owner, this
week filed a reorganization plan for about $9.7 billion of
mortgages secured by 92 regional shopping centers, community
retail centers and office buildings. Under the plan, all claims
would be paid in full, and loan-maturity dates would be extended
by an average of 5.2 years. </p>
<p>Before filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in
April, Chicago-based General Growth had been trying to sell real
estate including Boston''s Faneuil Hall, South Street Seaport in
New York City, and the Fashion Show and Shoppes at the Palazzo
malls in Las Vegas. Those sales won''t be necessary under the
planned reorganization, Nolan said. </p>
<p>General Growth rose $1.03 to $7.98 in over-the-counter
trading as of 3:59 p.m. The shares reached their highest level
since Oct. 3, 2008. </p>
<h2>Simon Property''s Plans </h2>
<p>Simon Property, the largest U.S. mall owner, has been
working on an approach toward its biggest rival. Simon hired
merger adviser Lazard Ltd. and Wachtell Lipton Rosen  Katz, a
law firm focusing on acquisitions, for advice on General Growth,
Simon said on Nov. 17. </p>
<p>We''re flattered by the interest in General Growth
expressed by a whole host of investors, including Simon, Nolan
said. We''re very focused on the immediate task at hand, which
is to get the company recapitalized, restructured, and emerge
from bankruptcy as one of the premier owners of regional
shopping centers in the U.S. </p>
<p>Simon Property spokesman Les Morris declined to comment. </p>
<p>Simon Chief Executive Officer David Simon has said his
company is a logical buyer for General Growth malls.
There''s a lot we could do with those properties, he said in
a Sept. 15 interview on Bloomberg Television. </p>
<h2>Sales Per Foot </h2>
<p>General Growth owns four of the five U.S. malls with the
highest sales per square foot, with the other owned by
Indianapolis-based Simon Property (SPG), according to estimates by
real estate research company Green Street Advisors. </p>
<p>General Growth was caught in the credit crunch, unable to
refinance debt amassed when it purchased the Rouse Co. for $11.3
billion in 2004. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Allan Gropper in New York
scheduled a Dec. 15 hearing to rule on confirmation of the
restructuring plan for the $9.7 billion in secured debt. </p>
<p>General Growth''s best-performing malls are the Grand Canal
Shoppes and Fashion Show in Las Vegas, Ala Moana Center in
Honolulu, and Whalers Village in Lahaina on the island of Maui
in Hawaii, according to Green Street. All four have annual sales
per square foot of $1,100 to $1,200. Ala Moana is among the
properties in this week''s plan. </p>
<p>General Growth still must reach agreements with lenders on
about $5.2 billion of debt secured by properties, and with
holders of about $7 billion of unsecured debt, before it can
emerge from bankruptcy. </p>
<p>The company has the exclusive right until February to
present a reorganization plan to the bankruptcy court. </p>
<h2>Important Step'' </h2>
<p>This week''s agreement doesn''t ensure anything, but it is
an important step, said James Sullivan, an analyst with
Newport Beach, California-based Green Street. </p>
<p>The plan pressures other secured-debt holders to reach an
agreement with General Growth, he said. </p>
<p>Then it becomes an issue of what happens to the unsecured
debt, Sullivan said. There it becomes much more difficult. </p>
<p>It''s among unsecured debt holders that Simon or another
buyer may find support for a potential takeover of General
Growth, according to Sullivan. Unsecured creditors may not want
to exchange their debt for General Growth equity, the most
likely method of extinguishing corporate-level debt, he said.
General Growth has few choices for paying them. </p>
<p>They don''t have the cash to pay off the unsecured debt in
full, Sullivan said. Someone else might -- Simon or
Westfield. That''s what makes a bid for the whole company so
intriguing. </p>
<p>Westfield Group (WDC), a Sydney-based mall owner with 55 U.S.
shopping centers, doesn''t comment on speculation,
spokeswoman Catharine Dickey said. </p>
<h2>Mall Portfolio </h2>
<p>Greg Cross, the Baltimore-based chairman of the bankruptcy
group of law firm Venable LLP, said this week''s agreement may
help General Growth keep its mall holdings intact. Cross
represents members of the secured-creditors group with more than
$4 billion of General Growth debt. </p>
<p>It''s a significant step toward General Growth emerging
completely from bankruptcy, Cross said in an interview. </p>
<p>This week''s agreement also was positive for holders of
commercial mortgage-backed securities, said Sullivan of Green
Street and Adam Fox, a senior director with Fitch Ratings in New
York. General Growth surprised bondholders when it included nine
special-purpose entity borrowers owning 166 securitized
properties in its bankruptcy filing. </p>
<p>The successful resolution substantially alleviates the
risk of rating downgrades for the transactions, with the loans
being paid in full, Fox said yesterday in a note to investors. </p>
<p>Standard  Poor''s said it''s reviewing General Growth''s
proposed plan to see how it may affect CMBS ratings. We
believe these modifications to the loan documents, in and of
themselves, are not likely to prompt negative rating activity,
the credit-rating company said today in a note to investors. </p>

<p>Let''s make banking boring again. That
is the noble goal of those calling for a return to the days when
the Glass-Steagall Act separated commercial and investment
banking. </p>
<p>The idea is that banks taking deposits insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., and so backed by taxpayers,
shouldn''t play in the capital-markets casino. </p>
<p>To really achieve this, though, legislators may have to do
more than restrict what banks can do. They may have to bring
Wall Street back to life. </p>
<p>That would be the natural consequence of forcing some too-
big-to-fail banks to go back to their commercial-banking roots,
as envisaged by legislation proposed earlier this week by
Senators John McCain and Maria Cantwell. JPMorgan Chase  Co.
would have to spin off Bear Stearns. Bank of America Corp. would
have to shed Merrill Lynch. Citigroup Inc. would have to hive
off its own investment-banking activities. </p>
<p>Given all that''s happened over the past two years this
might sound crazy. Actually, it can make lots of sense if
Congress simultaneously splits up Wall Street titans such as
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>And let''s not forget that the Glass-Steagall separation
worked for more than 60 years, from its passage in 1933 until
its repeal in 1999. The prohibition even gave birth to firms
such as Morgan Stanley, which in 1935 was spun off from what is
now JPMorgan. </p>
<p>First, though, a practical question: does such legislation
have any chance at success? </p>
<p>Long Odds </p>
<p>The odds are against it. Yet the politics of Wall Street,
bailouts and the economy are fluid, especially since 2010 will
see Congressional elections. </p>
<p>Plus, McCain and Cantwell aren''t the only ones buzzing
about Glass-Steagall. Earlier this week, House Majority Leader
Steny Hoyer said a return to that system is certainly under
discussion. </p>
<p>No wonder analysts at FBR Capital Markets in a research
note yesterday hedged their bets on just how far this may go.
While a forced breakup of banks may prove too big to swallow
for Congress, they wrote, this debate is going to garner the
spotlight much more quickly than we expected. </p>
<p>Politics aside, a renewed embrace of Glass-Steagall would
give current reform legislation real teeth. </p>
<p>The bills now in Congress provide for more stringent
regulation of financial institutions and impose rules such as
stronger capital requirements and a cap on the amount of
borrowed money firms can use to juice profit. </p>
<p>Falling Short </p>
<p>Yet they don''t tackle the issue of too big to fail.
Instead, by saying only that regulators can break them up as a
last resort, the legislation in the House gives the firms a
privileged status and doesn''t remove the threat that taxpayers
may again have to rescue them. </p>
<p>If the current strictures were combined with a new Glass-
Steagall-like provision, reform would have muscle. </p>
<p>Granted, Glass-Steagall isn''t a silver bullet. Plenty of
banks got into trouble in their bread-and-butter business of
lending to homeowners and businesses; Washington Mutual was a
good example. </p>
<p>That''s why the provisions in existing legislation for
beefed up regulation and capital are important, even if they
don''t go far enough on their own. </p>
<p>Congress shouldn''t stop there, though. Simply saying that
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are no longer bank-holding
companies (a coveted status they received last fall that allows
them to borrow at the Federal Reserve''s discount window), as
would likely happen under a Glass-Steagall-like split, won''t go
far enough. A newly reconstituted Wall Street would need to be
further divided. </p>
<p>Bundles of Conflicts </p>
<p>As things now stand, Wall Street and big banks are bundles
of conflicts that too often pit firms against their customers.
That led to some of the riskier practices that helped fuel the
financial crisis. </p>
<p>Investment houses underwrote and sold investors complex
bundles of mortgages, for example, even as they bet the housing
market would crater. </p>
<p>This needs to change. Either a firm is an adviser, a
broker, an asset manager or a hedge fund. It can''t be all things
to all customers. Nor can a firm be all those things and not
create the kind of linkages that threaten the stability of the
financial system. </p>
<p>So firms should have to choose between being, say, brokers
and investment bankers versus proprietary trading shops or asset
managers. </p>
<p>Making a Choice </p>
<p>In that case, if Goldman Sachs wants to be a giant hedge
fund, that''s all it should be. After all, some smaller, focused
players such as hedge funds failed during the crisis but didn''t
require taxpayer bailouts. </p>
<p>Splitting up Wall Street would also make finance easier to
regulate. In their current agglomerated state, too many firms
are impenetrable black boxes. </p>
<p>Regulators don''t really know what''s going on inside.
Neither do investors. And it often seems management is clueless
as well. </p>
<p>To be sure, changes along these lines would be painful and
bitterly opposed by banks and Wall Street. They would also be
tough to swallow since foreign banks wouldn''t face similar
restrictions. </p>
<p>Even former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, who for
months seemed like a lone voice in favor of Glass-Steagall, has
admitted it''s tough to draw the line between certain banking and
trading activities. </p>
<p>Still, it''s worth a try. The result, as McCain said, may be
a larger number of smaller, more aggressive companies that are
not so big that their failure would bring the entire economy
down. </p>
<p>That would be good for markets, competition, the economy,
and ultimately banks themselves. </p>
<p>Plus, if Congress isn''t willing to find a new way to end
the threat of too-big-to-fail firms, why not revisit a proven
antidote. </p>
