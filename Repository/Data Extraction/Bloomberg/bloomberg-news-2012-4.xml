<p>His striped cravat tucked inside a
heavily decorated uniform, India''s army chief last week sent
tremors through one of the few government ministries to have
escaped 17 months of scandal and intrigue. </p>
<p>A day after the general said he''d been offered a bribe to
approve a contract, Defense Minister A.K. Antony told parliament
he''d known of the claim since 2010 yet hadn''t ordered an inquiry.
The flap deepened a perception of mismanagement pervading Prime
Minister Manmohan Singh''s cabinet that began with auditors in
2010 vilifying the handling of sales of mobile-phone licenses. </p>
<p>Antony, whose personal probity helped him win charge of a
department where graft scuttled an earlier government, joined
cabinet colleagues engaged in fighting fires rather than making
policy. With two years left before a national election is due,
the vacuum of leadership has helped fuel a surge in support for
regional parties now crippling efforts by the federal government
to shrink a fiscal deficit and embrace foreign investment. </p>
<p>The government is just limping from crisis to crisis,
said Satish Misra, a political analyst at Observer Research
Foundation, a policy-research group based in New Delhi. Just
as it tries to get some traction, another problem drags it
down. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, named James J. Schiro to succeed
John H. Bryan as lead independent director, tapping an executive
with accounting and insurance experience. </p>
<p>Bryan, the second-longest serving director, won''t run for
re-election at the annual meeting after reaching the board''s
retirement age of 75, the company said yesterday in a statement.
Lois D. Juliber, 64, who joined the board in March 2004, also is
stepping down at the annual meeting, leaving the firm with 10
directors. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd C. Blankfein, in February staved off a shareholder
proposal to split his roles by agreeing to appoint an
independent board member as lead director. Brooklyn-born
Schiro, who joined the board in 2009, is the former CEO of
Zurich Financial Services AG (ZURN), Switzerland''s biggest insurer, and
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. </p>
<p>That background is helpful, said Eleanor Bloxham, CEO
of Value Alliance Co., a board advisory firm in Westerville,
Ohio. One of the things they really need to think about for
this board is the level of expertise in the financial
industry. </p>
<p>PwC, one of the world''s four biggest accounting firms, has
been Goldman Sachs''s auditor since before the firm went public
in 1999, according to David Wells, a bank spokesman in New York. </p>

<p>Potential downgrades of banks
including Morgan Stanley (MS) and UBS AG, which could have their
credit ratings cut by Moody''s Investors Service to the lowest
level ever, threaten to shake up Wall Street''s balance of power. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley and UBS may be lowered three grades, Moody''s
said Feb. 15, and Citigroup Inc. (C) and Bank of America Corp. could
join Morgan Stanley at Baa2, two levels above junk. The cuts
would raise funding and collateral costs, making the lowest-
rated firms less desirable counterparties in over-the-counter
derivatives trades, according to analysts and executives. </p>
<p>That may push more business to JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and
Deutsche Bank AG, which would be the highest-rated firms among
the top nine global investment banks if Moody''s goes through
with its maximum reductions. Those two firms already have the
highest market share in fixed-income trading and had the biggest
gains in share last year as investors grappled with fears about
global contagion from Europe''s debt crisis. </p>
<p>The winners are JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, who
relatively will have stronger ratings, and the losers will be
Citi, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley, said Brad Hintz, an
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in New York and a former
treasurer at Morgan Stanley. Lower ratings hurt the
willingness of players to take my name as a derivatives
counterparty, and it is in derivatives where I get some of the
highest-margin businesses in fixed income. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is tightening
its grip on the global corporate bond market, taking share from
Citigroup Inc. (C) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and topping all
underwriters as companies sold a record $1.17 trillion of debt. </p>
<p>The most profitable U.S. bank''s underwrote 7.1 percent of
all bond sales in the three months ended March 31, up from 6.5
percent in 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Citigroup
moved up two spots to second with 5.7 percent, the same amount
it captured last year. Bank of America dropped to third with 5.6
percent, down from 6.1 percent in 2011. Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), which
dropped to fourth from third, handled 5.5, down from 5.9. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is leading banks reaping the benefits of a Federal
Reserve outlook that benchmark interest rates will hold near
zero until at least late 2014 and an easing in Europe''s debt
crisis that has bolstered confidence that default rates will
stay below the historical averages. Increased demand for higher-
yielding assets is allowing companies from Australia to
Amsterdam to borrow at record-low rates. </p>
<p>A real positive outcome on Europe kicked the market into
high gear, said Richard Zogheb, co-head of capital markets
origination for the Americas at Citigroup in New York. He cited
European Central Bank''s unlimited three-year loans to the
region''s lenders and a restructuring of Greece''s debt as
reassuring bondholders. Investor demand has been incredibly
strong, he said. </p>
<h2>Record Sales </h2>
<p>The average bond yield for companies from the neediest to
the most creditworthy is 0.15 percentage point from the record
low 3.99 percent reached in October 2010, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch''s Global Broad Market Corporate  High
Yield Index. Yields fell to 4.14 percent on March 30 from 4.17
percent a week earlier. </p>
<p>Corporate debt sales at a record start to the year are
making underwriting one bright spot for Wall Street earnings.
Mergers and acquisitions in the quarter fell about 14 percent
from the fourth quarter, making it the slowest three-month
period in 2 1/2 years, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>The largest U.S. banks will probably post a 10 percent
decline in first-quarter fixed-income trading revenue from a
year earlier and an 8 percent decline in equities trading, Keith Horowitz, a Citigroup bank analyst, said in a March 29 note. </p>
<h2>Shrinking Spreads </h2>
<p>Elsewhere in credit markets, benchmark gauges of corporate
credit risk in the U.S. and Europe fell for a second day as
manufacturing in the world''s biggest economy expanded at a
faster pace in March. Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. (HIG),
the insurer being pressured by investor John Paulson to break
up, will pay about $2.43 billion to buy back debt and warrants
issued to Allianz SE. </p>

<p>Ambac Assurance Corp. sued JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM), accusing the company''s EMC Mortgage and Bear
Stearns units of fraud and breach of contract over the sale of
mortgage-backed securities. </p>
<p>The lawsuit is the second filed in New York State Supreme
by the insurer against JPMorgan Chase  Co. over the
investments, a central part of the housing bubble that helped
push the U.S. into the biggest recession since the 1930s. Ambac
sued the New York-based bank in February 2011, claiming it was
fraudulently induced to participate in the investments. </p>
<p>The securitization transaction and loans at issue in this
action are different, but the story is the same, lawyers for
Ambac said in the most recent lawsuit, filed on March 30. The
loans involved in the transactions at issue in this case are
plagued by the same pervasive defects found in the transactions
at issue in Ambac''s original action against Bear Stearns. </p>
<p>The bond insurer said in the lawsuit that it has had to pay
more than $200 million in claims as of Feb. 29 because of the
failed investments. </p>
<p>Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, didn''t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the suit. </p>
<p>Ambac Assurance was the second-largest bond insurer before
the 2008 financial crisis, when mounting defaults on mortgages
swamped the company with claims. It guaranteed about $256
billion of $1.4 trillion in insured municipal debt, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>A U.S. bankruptcy judge in Manhattan on March 15 approved a
plan to reorganize the $1.7 billion in debt of New York-based
Ambac Financial Group Inc. (ABKFQ), the bankrupt holding company for
Ambac Assurance. </p>
<p>EMC Mortgage was a unit of Bear Stearns Cos. until the
investment bank was bought by JPMorgan in 2008. </p>
<p>The cases are Ambac Assurance v. EMC Mortgage, 651013/2012
and 650421/2011, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan). </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) has partnered with a team building the world''s largest
radio telescope to develop super computer systems to make sense
of light years of space data and the history of the universe. </p>
<p>The Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy, known as
ASTRON, and IBM will collaborate to research so-called exascale
computers that consume little power. The technology will be
needed to study faint radio signals from deep space produced by
the Big Bang 13 billion years ago -- to be collected by the
Square Kilometre Array telescope when it''s completed in 2024. </p>
<p>The telescope will be used to explore evolving galaxies,
dark matter and even the very origins of the universe, IBM and
ASTRON said in a statement. Scientists estimate that the
processing power required to operate the telescope will be equal
to several millions of today''s fastest computers. </p>
<p>The initial five-year, 32.9 million euro ($43.9 million)
DOME project in Drenthe, the Netherlands, will investigate
technologies necessary to read, store and analyze one exabyte of
raw data per day -- twice today''s entire daily Internet traffic.
IBM, the world''s biggest computer-services provider, is
advancing technologies that increase memory capacity and reduce
power consumption to process near-limitless data, to help
business and government clients analyze performance and project
trends. </p>
<h2>Futuristic Technology'' </h2>
<p>We have to invent futuristic technology to look into the
past, Ronald Luijten, IBM''s lead researcher on the project in
Zurich, Switzerland, said in an interview. The energy issue is
becoming ubiquitous. We need fundamental new technologies to
deal with the needs of the future data centers. </p>
<p>IBM rose 0.2 percent to $208.97 at 9:30 a.m. New York time.
The shares had gained 13 percent this year before today. </p>
<p>The 1.5 billion euro telescope project is comparable in
size, cost and international participation to the Large Hadron
Collider developed by CERN, the European Organization for
Nuclear Research, Luijten said. The collider is looking for the
same answers as the telescope, by smashing protons together
inside its particle accelerator, creating what Luijten called
mini Big Bangs. </p>
<p>Construction of the super telescope will begin in 2017. It
will be positioned in Australia or South Africa where there is
enough space to accommodate 3,000 dishes -- one square
kilometers'' worth of antenna positioned across a continent, that
make up the super telescope, Luijten said. </p>
<p>IBM, based in Armonk, New York, has partnered with
governments and universities in both potential host countries to
develop software that will filter out the noise the
telescope collects and create sky maps for astronomers. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley is forecasting gains
of about 26 percent for Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong amid
low valuations and expectations for improving company earnings
and economic growth this year. </p>
<p>The brokerage expects the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index
of so-called H shares to rise to 13,400 by the end of the year,
analysts including Jonathan Garner wrote in a report today,
compared with the gauge''s previous close of 10,640.16. Morgan
Stanley predicts Hong Kong''s benchmark Hang Seng Index to rise
to 23,600, 15 percent above its last closing level, while the
MSCI China Index may rise 20 percent to 70. </p>
<p>The H-share index gained 7.1 percent in the three months
through last week for its second straight quarterly gain. The
gauge sank 7.2 percent since March 5 when China unveiled a lower
annual target for the nation''s gross domestic product. The
measure trades for 8 times estimated profit, a 22 percent
discount to the Hang Seng Index (HSI)''s 10.3 multiple, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>We are going to look at sequential acceleration from the
second quarter onwards, probably accompanied by additional
gradual policy easing, Garner said in a telephone interview
from Hong Kong today. That will lead to a better price-to-
earnings re-rating of the H-shares (HSCEI) because that''s more
influenced by China GDP growth. </p>
<p>The H-share gauge rose 0.2 percent as of the close in Hong
Kong today, while the Hang Seng Index dropped 0.2 percent. The
MSCI China Index lost less than 0.1 percent. </p>
<h2>Fine Tuning </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley increased its estimate for China''s 2012
gross domestic product to 9 percent from 8.4 percent, according
to an e-mailed research report on March 29. A Purchasing
Managers'' Index (CPMINDX) rose to a one-year high of 53.1 in March,
China''s logistics federation and the National Bureau of
Statistics said yesterday. </p>
<p>Premier Wen Jiabao has pledged to fine-tune economic
policies as needed as weakness in export demand and a cooling
housing market restrain an economy that probably grew at the
slowest pace in almost three years in the first quarter. </p>
<p>It''s really those two things -- the degree of cheapness
of the market and the prospect for change in perception about
China''s growth that will support the shares of Chinese
companies traded in Hong Kong, Garner said. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX) and Transocean Ltd (RIG) are
being sued for another 20 billion reais ($11 billion) by a
Brazilian federal prosecutor for a second oil spill at the Frade
project off the nation''s coast. </p>
<p>Chevron committed a series of errors that led to the
March spill at the project, the federal prosecutor''s office said
in an e-mailed statement today. Prosecutor Eduardo Santos is
also seeking to halt operations at Frade and block Chevron from
exporting profits from Brazil, according to the statement. </p>
<p>Santos filed the first 20 billion-reais lawsuit last year
against San Ramon, California-based Chevron after a 3,000-barrel
spill in November. Santos filed criminal charges against Chevron
and Transocean executives last month, seeking penalties of as
much as 31 years in prison for environmental crimes. </p>
<p>A drilling accident caused the November spill after Chevron
underestimated the amount of pressure at a reservoir where it
was drilling, causing oil to leak from the well to fissures on
the seabed. </p>
<p>In March, Chevron reported new leaks on the seabed at the
project. Chevron has halted production at Frade as a
precautionary measure. </p>
<p>Chevron didn''t immediately respond to an e-mail and phone

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said one of
its private equity funds agreed to exit a 12-year-old stake in
Village Voice Media at a loss because the bank is uncomfortable
with the company''s direction. </p>
<p>GS Capital Partners III, a $2.78 billion fund raised in
1998, invested $30 million in the alternative weekly newspaper
publisher in 2000, according to Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman
for New York-based Goldman Sachs. New Times Media Plc bought
Village Voice Media in 2006 and Goldman Sachs kept a 16 percent
stake, Raphael said. </p>
<p>The fund will lose most of its original $30 million
investment after signing an agreement on March 30 to sell the
stake back to the company''s management, Raphael said. Goldman
Sachs relinquished its seat on Village Voice Media''s board in
2010 as a result of being uncomfortable with the direction of
the company, and the fund had sought to exit the investment
for a long time, she said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs provided 18.5 percent of the capital in GS
Capital Partners III, Raphael said. She declined to comment on
the overall performance of the fund, which is in the process of
harvesting its investments. </p>
<p>Backpage.com, a website owned by Village Voice Media,
accounts for about 70 percent of prostitution advertising among
five websites that carry such ads in the U.S., Nicholas D. Kristof, a New York Times columnist, reported on March 18,

Goldman Sachs sold its stake after he began inquiring about it. </p>
<p>Scott Tobias, president and chief operating officer of
Village Voice Media, didn''t reply to a voicemail seeking
comment. </p>
<p>Village Voice Media, in a March 21 blog post responding to
the earlier Kristof column, said that Backpage dedicates
hundreds of staff to screen adult classifieds in order to keep

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), the sixth-biggest
U.S. bank, was ordered by the Federal Reserve to review
foreclosures conducted by its Saxon mortgage servicer before the
unit was sold and compensate injured borrowers. </p>
<p>The bank agreed to hire a consultant to review foreclosures
pending in 2009 and 2010, correct errors and misrepresentations
and reimburse borrowers for unreasonable penalties or
impermissible costs, according to a consent order released today
by the Fed. Morgan Stanley acknowledged it would be responsible
for any penalty assessed against Saxon. </p>
<p>Regulators are targeting U.S. banks that engaged in shoddy
foreclosure practices, including the use of faulty documents to
seize homes. The five biggest mortgage servicers, including Bank
of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Citigroup Inc.,
reached a $25 billion settlement with 49 states and the federal
government in February. Some state attorneys general are
conducting further probes into suspected misconduct. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley failed to respond in a sufficient and
timely manner to the increased level of foreclosures by
increasing financial, staffing and managerial resources to
ensure that Saxon adequately handled the foreclosure process,
the Fed said. The New York-based bank failed to have adequate
internal controls, policies and procedures, compliance risk
management, internal audit, training and oversight. </p>
<h2>Ocwen Financial </h2>
<p>Ocwen Financial Corp. (OCN) agreed in October to buy Saxon as
Morgan Stanley exits the mortgage-servicing business it bought
before the housing-market slump. The sale of Saxon assets was
completed yesterday, the Fed said. </p>
<p>Mary Claire Delaney, a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley,
declined to comment. The bank fell 1.9 percent, or 38 cents, to
$19.43 at 12:15 p.m. in New York trading. The shares gained 31
percent this year through yesterday after tumbling 44 percent in
2011. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley bought Glen Allen, Virginia-based Saxon in
2006 for $706 million as the investment bank sought a mortgage
issuer and servicer to provide home loans that it packaged into
securities. The bank serviced a portfolio of more than 225,000
residential mortgage loans, many of which became delinquent
during the financial crisis, the Fed said. During 2009 and 2010,
Saxon initiated at least 60,313 foreclosure actions, according
to the Fed. </p>
<h2>Personal Knowledge'' </h2>
<p>The Saxon unit''s staff said in foreclosure-related
documents that its assertions were based on personal knowledge
or based on a review, when this was often not the case, the
Fed said. Saxon pursued foreclosure proceedings without always
confirming that the documentation was in order, according to the
central bank. </p>
<p>The bank took a $700 million writedown in the fourth
quarter of 2008 related to businesses it owned, with most of the
charge coming from Saxon. Mortgage servicers do billing and
collections on behalf of banks and investors that own the home
loans, and handle foreclosures when borrowers default. </p>

the VIX rises has jumped more than fivefold this year, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Justin Perras, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment. </p>
<p>The VIX has plummeted 64 percent in the last two quarters,
the most ever, Bloomberg data show. The gauge, which touched its
lowest level since June 2007 on March 26, gained 0.9 percent to
15.64 yesterday. </p>
<p>JPMorgan sold $23.6 million in 15-month notes tied to its
proprietary gauge on March 13, the bank''s largest such sale,
according to Bloomberg data. The notes yield the gains and
losses in the index, according to a prospectus filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The New York-based bank
distributed the securities for a 1 percent commission. </p>
<h2>Mitigating Contango </h2>
<p>The volatility index, created July 30, 2010, is long on VIX
futures with a maturity of about two months, and short on those
of about one month, whenever the fear gauge is less than the
weighted average of one- and two-month contracts. Selling some
futures short, with an expectation of a price drop, is intended
to mitigate the problem of contango. </p>
<p>ETNs are unsecured bank debt backed by their issuer''s
credit, unlike exchange-traded funds, which hold assets. Banks
create and redeem shares of ETNs based on the level of demand
for the securities. That demand typically doesn''t affect the
price since the ETNs track the performance of an index. </p>

<p>Ian Hannam, one of JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM)''s top advisers to mining companies, stepped down to appeal a
450,000-pound ($720,000) fine from the U.K. markets regulator
for disclosing inside information. </p>
<p>Hannam, JPMorgan''s global chairman of equity capital
markets, e-mailed a potential customer in 2008 with details of a
bid for his client Heritage Oil Plc (HOIL), as well as news of an oil
find, the Financial Services Authority said in a statement
today. The 56-year-old is the most senior banker to be fined by
the FSA in its four-year-old crackdown on insider trading. </p>
<p>I strongly believe, and have been advised by my legal
counsel, that the FSA''s conclusions are wrong and I look forward
to challenging them, London-based Hannam said in a separate
statement. The FSA has not challenged my fit and proper status
and has accepted that I acted with honesty and integrity. </p>
<p>He is among bankers advising Xstrata Plc, the subject of a
bid from Glencore International Plc (GLEN). At JPMorgan, which also
serves as a broker to Xstrata, Hannam helped the mining company
first sell shares in 2002, and was involved in many of its
subsequent takeovers, including the $18.1 billion purchase of
the Canadian nickel producer Falconbridge Ltd. in 2006. </p>
<p>He has always acted with honesty and integrity, Xstrata
Chief Executive Officer Mick Davis said in a statement today.
He continues to have my full support in his appeal. </p>
<h2>Extremely Valuable'' </h2>
<p>JPMorgan is the third-ranked mergers adviser in Europe this
year after Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In mining mergers, the
bank is placed second after Morgan Stanley, the data show. </p>
<p>The firm was the top-ranked arranger of equity offerings in
Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the five years through the
end of 2011, the data show. JPMorgan was also the top-ranked
manager of IPOs in the region in the period. </p>
<p>Inside information is extremely valuable and must be
handled with care to ensure that it is properly controlled and
that appropriate safeguards are observed, Tracey McDermott,
acting head of financial crime at the FSA, said in a statement. </p>
<p>The regulator fined Andrew Osborne, a broker at Bank of
America Corp., 350,000 pounds in February for disclosing inside
information to Greenlight Capital Inc. Chairman David Einhorn.
Osborne told Einhorn the company was about to sell new stock,
prompting Einhorn to order traders to sell the firm''s shares
within minutes, according to the regulator. Osborne quit and
Einhorn and Greenlight were fined 7.2 million pounds by the FSA. </p>
<h2>Heritage Offer </h2>
<p>Hannam will complete his current commitments before leaving
the bank, Emilio Saracho, the head of investment banking for
Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said in a memorandum to
employees today. Calls to Hannam''s mobile phone were referred to
JPMorgan''s press office. Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for the
firm in London, declined to comment beyond the memo. </p>
<p>Hannam sent an e-mail to an unidentified contact on Sept.
9, 2008, in which he said Heritage, a British oil and gas
exploration firm, would receive an offer valued at between 350
pence and 400 pence a share, according to the FSA. The stock
closed at 204 pence in London that day. </p>
<p>The recipient of the e-mail was a representative of an
organization that had interests in the Kurdistan region of Iraq,
an area where Heritage had exploration projects, the FSA said.
Nine days after the e-mail was sent, Heritage disclosed it was
in preliminary talks to sell some assets. </p>
<h2>Looking Good'' </h2>
<p>In a second e-mail a month later, Hannam told his contact
that Heritage has just found oil and it is looking good.
Jersey, U.K.-based Heritage announced a find later that month. </p>
<p>No trades were made on the inside information, the FSA
said. The recipient of Hannam''s e-mail later hired him to set up
a fund for making investments in Kurdistan, the FSA said. </p>
<p>Hannam, a former soldier, graduated from Imperial College
London and London Business School, and trained at Salomon
Brothers. In 1992, he joined Robert Fleming  Co., which was
bought by Chase Manhattan in 2000. Four years later, he helped
to set up JPMorgan''s joint venture with London-based Cazenove
Group Ltd. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said Motorola
Mobility Holdings Inc. (MMI) demanded $4 billion a year in patent
royalties for use of technology critical to functioning of the
Xbox video-gaming system. </p>
<p>Motorola''s demand was so over-reaching that no rational
company could ever have accepted it or even viewed it as a
legitimate offer, Microsoft said in a March 30 filing. </p>
<p>Both companies want a federal judge in Seattle to rule
whether Libertyville, Illinois-based Motorola Mobility broke its
promise to license patents essential to comply with industry
standards on wireless networking and video coding on fair and
non-discriminatory terms. </p>
<p>The case is part of a broader dispute in which Motorola
Mobility is seeking to block sales of the Xbox, and Microsoft
wants a ban on U.S. imports of Motorola Mobility phones that run
on Google Inc. (GOOG)''s Android operating system. </p>
<p>Microsoft said Motorola Mobility is seeking $4 billion a
year for licensing 50 patents on video compression. The
entertainment division of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft
generated $8.9 billion in sales last year. Microsoft''s total
revenue was $69.9 billion in the fiscal year that ended June 30,
2011. </p>
<p>The software maker said it pays $6.5 million a year to a
group of 29 companies with 2,339 patents that cover the same
industry standard. </p>
<p>Motorola Mobility contends that the licensing offer made in
October 2010 -- a 2.25 percent royalty on the total value of a
product -- was the same one it has presented to every company
over the past decade as a starting point for negotiations.
Instead, Microsoft filed the breach of contract suit. </p>
<p>Microsoft had never licensed the technology, and Motorola
never pushed it, because the two worked together to develop
phones that used Microsoft''s operating systems. The relationship
strained when the Microsoft platform failed to gain market share
and Motorola Mobility turned to Android, Motorola Mobility said. </p>
<p>Microsoft and Apple Inc. (AAPL), which has its own patent battles
with Motorola Mobility, have both filed complaints with the
European Union accusing the handset maker of misusing its
patents on standard-essential technology </p>
<p>The U.S. case is Microsoft Corp. v. Motorola Inc.,
10cv1823, U.S. District Court for the District of Washington
(Seattle). </p>
<h2>ECOJ Says Polish Generics Drugs Legislation Violates EU Law </h2>
<p>The European Court of Justice said Polish legislation
permitting the importation of unauthorized generic forms of
drugs already permitted in the market is contrary to European
Union law. </p>
<p>In a March 29 statement, the court said Poland''s use of
permitted special needs drug importation base only on lower
price isn''t justified. The special needs exception must be
interpreted strictly, applicable in exceptional cases where it
is appropriate to meet special medical needs, not for
financial considerations in themselves, the court said. </p>
<p>The court said that the present harmonized marketing
authorization within the EU enables cost-efficient and non-
discriminatory market access, while ensuring that the
requirements of safeguarding public health are met. </p>
<h2>Oracle, Google Settlement Talks Over Java Patent Failed </h2>
<p>Oracle Corp. (ORCL) and Google Inc. have reached an
irreconcilable impasse in settlement talks to resolve an
intellectual property dispute over the Java programming language
and their lawsuit should proceed to trial on April 16, a judge
said. </p>
<p>U.S. Magistrate Judge Paul Grewal in San Jose, California,
wrote in a filing yesterday that no further settlement
conferences will be scheduled. According to the court document,
the unfruitful negotiations went on for six hours. </p>
<p>Oracle accused Google in a 2010 lawsuit of infringing
patents related to its Java software in the company''s Android
mobile software. With a settlement, the companies avoid the risk
of a jury deciding whether Google owes royalties. </p>
<p>The case is Oracle America Inc. v. Google Inc., 10-03561,
U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San
Francisco). </p>

<h2>Trademark </h2>
<h2>IPad Trademark Fight to Continue After China Court Ruling </h2>
<p>A Chinese court rejected a creditor''s application to
liquidate Proview Technology (Shenzhen) Co., allowing the failed
display maker to pursue its legal fight against Apple Inc. over
the iPad trademark in China. </p>
<p>The Shenzhen Intermediate People''s Court ruled against
Fubon Insurance''s bid to liquidate Proview, Roger Xie, a lawyer
for Proview, said by phone yesterday. The decision was released
to litigants on March 31, he said. </p>
<p>The same Chinese court ruled in November that Proview owned
the iPad trademark in China, saying Apple''s 2009 contract to
acquire rights to the name was invalid. The Cupertino,
California-based company has appealed, and a decision is
expected within two months. Proview has filed separate
complaints alleging that Apple''s sale of iPad tablets in the
country infringed intellectual-property laws. </p>
<p>Fubon Insurance, a unit of Taipei-based Fubon Financial
Holding Co. (2881), is assessing whether to take further action in the
case, according to an e-mailed statement yesterday. The
application for liquidating Proview was taken on behalf of
reinsurance partners, Fubon said March 6. </p>
<p>Proview will continue its litigation with Apple, Xie said
yesterday. The action against Apple, the world''s most-valuable
company, might have been affected if Fubon''s application had
been granted, he said. The rejection was first reported by
China''s state-run Xinhua News Agency. </p>
<p>Proview Technology, a unit of Hong Kong-listed Proview
International Holdings Ltd. (334), has filed complaints to more than
40 branches of the Administration for Industry and Commerce in
China, Ma Dongxiao, another company lawyer, said in February.
Court actions have been lodged in Shanghai, Shenzhen and
Huizhou, Ma said. </p>
<p>Apple has said it bought the rights to the iPad trademark
in China from Proview. </p>
<p>Tim Tebow''s Fans Seek to Register Timsanity'' as U.S. Trademark </p>
<p>First came Linsanity, the coined word associated with
Jeremy Lin of the New York Knicks National Basketball
Association team. </p>
<p>Now it''s Timsanity, associated with quarterback Tim
Tebow, who was traded to the New York Jets National Football
League team. </p>
<p>Lawyers representing Lin sent cease-and-desist letters to
several applicants not connected to the basketball player who
tried to register Linsanity as a trademark. Lin''s lawyer,
Pamela Deese of Washington''s Arent Fox LLP (1377L), told the Huffington
Post that applicants'' enthusiasm for the player got ahead of
their understanding of the law. </p>
<p>According to the database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office, three applications have been filed to register
Timsanity as a trademark. The applications were filed March
21 and 22, shortly after Heisman Trophy winner Tebow signed with
the Jets March 20. </p>
<p>Christian Perez of Astoria, New York, filed an application
March 22 to register the term for use on clothing. LifeNatural
Corp. of Cheyenne, Wyoming, filed an application one day
earlier, also for use with clothing. Frank deGrimm of New York
City also filed a March 21 application to use the mark on
clothing. </p>
<p>Palmer Says Casino'' Mark Registered Only to Stop Others'' Use </p>
<p>Although he registered Coolum Casino as a trademark,
the billionaire owner of the Australia''s Coolum Resort  Spa
denied he plans to establish a casino, the Australian newspaper
reported. </p>
<p>Clive Palmer said in a statement that he hadn''t discussed
establishing a casino with any authorities or the Queensland
government, according to the Australian. </p>
<p>Palmer, who is known as the richest man in the Queensland
region, paid an undisclosed amount to Hyatt Hotels Corp. to
remove the hotel company as Coolum Resort  Spa''s manager, the
Australian reported. </p>
<p>Although he registered the www.coolumcasino.com.au domain
name, to stop others from grabbing it, Palmer said a casino
could have a detrimental social effect on the region,
according to the Australian. </p>
<h2>Mike Ashley of Newcastle United Wins Sports Direct'' Dispute </h2>
<p>The owner of the Premier Football League''s Newcastle United
team prevailed in a trademark dispute over the name of his
sportswear company Sports Direct, the U.K.''s Shields Gazette
reported. </p>
<p>Mike Ashley''s Sports Direct International (SPD) became the target
of a trademark infringement action by a husband-and-wife team
that claimed it had used the name for their company -- Sport
Direct Ltd. -- since 2005, according to the newspaper. </p>
<p>The hearing officer at the U.K.''s Intellectual Property
Office made a determination that Ashley''s company had used
Sports Direct long before the complaining company was named,
and rejected all claims, the newspaper reported. </p>
<p>Ashley based the Sports Direct name on Viking
Direct, a stationery firm he founded, according to the Shields
Gazette. </p>

<h2>Copyright </h2>
<h2>Chicago Judge Rejects Conspiracy Claim in BitTorrent Case </h2>
<p>In six consolidated copyright cases brought by adult
filmmakers against unnamed defendants, a federal judge in
Chicago has rejected their argument that the sharing of content
through the BitTorrent file-sharing protocol fits within federal
law''s definition of conspiracy. </p>
<p>In his March 30 order, U.S. District Judge James E.
Holderman said the plaintiffs claims of a civil conspiracy are
unfounded. He said the filmmakers had failed to argue that
an agreement existed among the alleged conspirators and that it
was implausible that they successfully could plead that a
conspiracy existed. </p>
<p>He called the conspiracy allegations unjustified
attempts to bolster their efforts to get more irrelevant
information about those who aren''t even parties to the cases. </p>
<p>The data would help the filmmakers either sue or try to
negotiate a settlement with these new potential defendants, he
said. He noted that federal case law holds that when the
purpose of a discovery request is to gather information for use
in proceedings other than the pending suit, discovery is
denied. </p>
<p>The case is Pacific Century International Ltd. V. Does 1-

in annual profit without losses on home loans, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said. </p>
<p>The main difference between what we are earning and what
we should be earning continues to be high costs and losses in
mortgage and mortgage-related issues, Dimon, 56, said in a
letter to shareholders released today. While mortgage losses
have abated, they will persist at elevated levels for a while
longer, he said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan faces higher litigation costs from its lending and
mortgage-bond business, even after settling some bigger cases in
the past year. The New York-based company earned a record $19
billion last year. </p>
<p>The lender agreed in February to pay $5.3 billion as part
of a $25 billion industrywide settlement with state and federal
officials over abusive foreclosure practices. JPMorgan also

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world''s largest computer-services provider, bought a
20 percent stake in the technology unit of Brazilian billionaire
Eike Batista as it expands to emerging markets. </p>
<p>IBM, as the Armonk, New York-based company is known, and
Batista''s SIX Automacao unit will set up a technology center to
serve customers in Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru, EBX Group
Co., the holding company for most of Batista''s assets, said
today in an e-mailed statement. IBM was also awarded a $1
billion contract to provide technology services to EBX for 10
years, it said. </p>
<p>IBM will contribute smarter industry solutions, providing
new products, software and services that complement SIX, the
company said, without disclosing the stake''s purchase price. </p>
<p>IBM Chief Executive Officer Virginia Rometty, who in
January became the first female CEO in the company''s 100-year
history, is pushing a five-year plan focusing on programs to
help businesses analyze and project trends, as well as in so-

Brazil, to 30 percent of sales by 2015. </p>
<p>Batista, Brazil''s richest person, is raising money to
develop his oil and mining businesses in Brazil and diversify

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG)
are being sued for $22 billion in environmental damages in
Brazil, double initial claims, after a federal prosecutor filed
a second lawsuit over oil spills off the nation''s coast. </p>
<p>Chevron committed a series of errors that led to the
March spill at Frade, the second incident at the offshore oil
project, the federal prosecutors'' office said in a statement
yesterday. Prosecutor Eduardo Santos de Oliveira is also seeking
to halt operations at Frade and block San Ramon, California-
based Chevron from transferring profits from Brazil. </p>
<p>The oil spill at the Frade field hasn''t been contained,
Oliveira said in the statement. The damages to the environment
and to Brazil''s natural resources are incalculable at this
point. </p>
<p>A leak of 3,000 barrels of crude into the Atlantic Ocean
off Rio de Janeiro''s coast in November and a seep in March have
led to a slew of probes against Chevron and Transocean, which
operated the rig at Frade. Oliveira filed the first 20 billion-
real ($11 billion) lawsuit last year and pressed criminal
charges against executives of the two companies last month,
seeking penalties of as many as 31 years in prison. </p>
<p>Chevron fell 1.4 percent to $105.60 at the close in New
York. Transocean fell 3.3 percent to $51.87. </p>
<p>Brazil risks discouraging other foreign oil companies from
investing in the country as it seeks to develop the largest oil
discoveries in the Americas since Mexico''s Cantarell find in
1976, Cleveland Jones, an oil specialist and geology professor
at Rio de Janeiro State University, said in a telephone
interview. </p>
<h2>Scared'' </h2>
<p>Other companies must be scared, even if they''re 100
percent right, they can be crucified in public opinion, Jones
said. </p>
<p>A drilling accident caused the November spill after Chevron
underestimated the amount of pressure at a reservoir, causing
oil to leak from the well to fissures on the seabed. </p>
<p>In March, Chevron reported new leaks on the seabed at the
project. Chevron said on March 29 that about a barrel of oil
leaked from the seabed that month. Chevron is collecting the oil
in underwater traps and the incident hasn''t damaged marine life,
the company said. </p>
<p>Chevron will vigorously defend the company and its
employees, Kurt Glaubitz, a spokesman, said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday. He called the charges outrageous and
without merit. </p>
<p>The 20 billion-real figure in both civil lawsuits is
arbitrary and has no legal and factual basis, Glaubitz said. </p>
<h2>Safety First'' </h2>
<p>Transocean acted responsibly, appropriately and quickly,
putting safety first, Guy Cantwell, a spokesman for the
Vernier, Switzerland-based company, said in an e-mail yesterday.
The crew always maintained control of the well and the rig''s
equipment worked perfectly. </p>
<p>Oliveira also started a probe into the work by Brazil''s
federal environmental agency Ibama and oil regulator ANP to
monitor companies that explore the country''s offshore fields. He
will also investigate emergency and accident prevention plans at
all platforms operating in the Campos Basin, where about 90
percent of Brazil''s crude is produced. </p>
<p>Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4), the country''s state-controlled oil
producer, may be liable for 30 percent of any damages Chevron
must pay at Frade because it has a stake in the project,
according to a March 30 regulatory filing. The $11 billion claim
filed last year was unreasonable, Petrobras, as the Rio de
Janeiro-based producer is known, said in the filing. </p>
<p>Petrobras didn''t respond to an e-mail and telephone call
seeking further comments on its exposure to damages. </p>
<h2>Other Probes </h2>
<p>Chevron holds a 52 percent stake in Frade and is the
operator. Partners include Petrobras and Frade Japao Petroleo
Ltda. -- a joint venture of INPEX Corp. (1605), Sojitz Corp. (2768) and Japan
Oil, Gas and Metals National Corp. -- with 18.26 percent. </p>
<p>Chevron also faces probes and fines from the ANP, Ibama and
Rio de Janeiro state''s environment secretariat. </p>
<p>Oliveira''s criminal charges against Chevron, Transocean and
17 of their top executives in Brazil on March 21 included a
request for them to surrender their passports. </p>
<p>In the first lawsuit seeking damage payments, filed on Dec.
14, Oliveira asked for the suspension of all activities by
Chevron and Transocean in Brazil until a final ruling on the
case. Federal Judge Raffaele Felice Pirro rejected the request
on Feb. 28, arguing it would represent a punishment before the
companies had a chance to defend themselves. </p>
<p>Pirro''s decision preventing the suspension was upheld by a
federal appeals court on March 29, following prosecutor Gisele
Port''s questioning of the ruling three days earlier. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) named Bryan Mix global head of loan trading, and Jonathan Meltzer and John Shaffer, co-heads of New York credit sales, following changes to
the bank''s leveraged finance group. </p>
<p>Mix, who is based in London, previously ran the Asia credit
business, according to Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the New
York-based firm. Meltzer was previously head of bank loan sales
in New York and Shaffer was head of high-yield and distressed
distribution groups in New York, said DuVally. </p>
<p>The changes at the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets come
after the firm began restricting people working in the loan
sales and trading business from receiving private information,
such as corporate financial projections. Credit Suisse Group AG
and Bank of America Corp. have taken similar steps to block
private information reaching loan traders about companies that
have both bank debt and sell publicly listed high-yield bonds.
The move allows them to sell both types of credits. </p>
<p>We have been discussing for some time the transition of
the loan business from behind the wall to the public side with
the rest of the leveraged finance business, Justin Gmelich,
global head of credit trading in New York, said in a telephone
interview. We thought we could serve our clients better with
an integrated trading model. Gmelich was named to this role
last month. </p>
<p>Leveraged loans, those rated below BBB- by Standard 
Poor''s and less than Baa3 at Moody''s Investors Service, are
usually private and investors in this debt can have access to
material non-public information that buyers of high-yield bonds
can''t. </p>
<h2>Private to Public </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs joins other banks that have moved their loan
traders to the public side. Bank of America and RBC Capital
Markets combined their loan sales forces in 2011 to make one
point of contact for both new-issue and secondary sales. In
limited situations, when a company just has loans, salesmen may
see private information. </p>
<p>At RBC, under the new structure, every salesmen will market
loans, high-yield and distressed debt for primary and secondary
markets. Credit Suisse''s U.S. loan sales and trading group also
will no longer receive private information on borrowers that
have both bank debt and public securities. </p>
<p>Banks are moving their loan sales and trading operations to
the public side as collateralized loan obligations, which
usually only buy this debt, are losing their market share to
other investors. </p>
<h2>Shifting Buyer Base </h2>
<p>Hedge funds and high-yield bond investors, who in 2007
represented only 27 percent of loan buyers, made up 40 percent
of the base in the third quarter of last year, according to the
Loan Syndications and Trading Association. The market share of
CLOs shrank to 38 percent from 57 percent in the same time
period, the New York-based trade group said. </p>
<p>The decision to convert our bank loan business from
private to public was largely predicated on the fact that the
majority of our clients prefer access to a fully integrated
leverage finance business, Thomas Cornacchia, Goldman Sachs
head of sales for fixed income, currencies and commodities in
the Americas, said in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>There will still be a leveraged loan sales team, a high-
yield sales group and a distressed credit desk, all of which
make up the leveraged finance business. Some team members will
cover clients that buy both loans and bonds. </p>
<p>In their new role Meltzer and Shaffer will oversee sales
for investment-grade credits, leveraged finance, structured
products, the credit products group and municipal bonds. They
will both report to Cornacchia. Mix will report to Gmelich and
Simon Morris, who heads credit trading in Europe and Asia. </p>
<h2>2011 Departures </h2>
<p>The changes at Goldman Sachs come after Courtney Mather,
head of U.S. loan trading, Blake W. Mather, who ran bank loan
sales, and Buckley T. Ratchford, head of global bank loan
trading and distressed investing, left the firm last year. </p>
<p>The credit sales team will also see additional departures
as Cynthia A. Cindy Brower and Wendy E. Sacks have also
announced they are leaving. They both sold loans and distressed
debt for the lender. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs held $19.75 billion of loans and bridge debt
as of Dec. 31, up from $18.04 billion a year earlier, according
to an annual filing. The company said those credits were held
in connection with our origination, investing and market-
making activities and didn''t break out how much was held for
each purpose. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank, will pay $20 million to resolve a U.S. regulator''s
claims that the firm mishandled customer funds from Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) from 2006 to 2008. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, serving as Lehman''s main clearing bank, counted
client money as belonging to the firm itself while extending
loans that let Lehman bet on markets, the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission said today in a statement. When Lehman filed
for bankruptcy in September 2008, JPMorgan refused to release
the money for two weeks until CFTC officials insisted, the
watchdog said. </p>
<p>Collapses of Wall Street firms including MF Global Holdings
Ltd. (MFGLQ) have spawned customer claims that their money was frozen or
lost after companies improperly used their holdings. Lehman at
times had more than $1 billion of clients'' funds deposited with
JPMorgan, which improperly counted segregated customer funds in
extending credit over a 22-month period, according to the CFTC. </p>
<p>The laws applying to customer segregated accounts impose
critical restrictions on how financial institutions can treat
customer funds, and prohibit these institutions from standing in
the way of immediate withdrawal, CFTC Enforcement Director
David Meister said in the agency''s statement. These laws must
be strictly observed at all times, whether the markets are calm
or in crisis. </p>
<p>JPMorgan settled claims that it violated commodities laws
without admitting or denying wrongdoing, according to the CFTC. </p>
<h2>Calculation Errors </h2>
<p>The errors were unintentional, and JPMorgan didn''t use
customer funds to meet any of Lehman''s obligations, the bank
said in a statement today. The entire balance of one Lehman
accounts was mistakenly factored into JPMorgan''s daily
calculation of the broker-dealer''s assets in determining how
much credit to extend, according to the statement. </p>
<p>The size of this customer account was small relative to
the overall relationship between JPMorgan and Lehman, as was any
additional credit extended by JPMorgan to Lehman as a result of
the account''s inclusion in the calculation of credit, JPMorgan
said. </p>
<p>Lehman, which filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history
with $613 billion in debt, said last month it was exiting court
protection and will make a first payment to creditors April 17. </p>
<h2>MF Global </h2>
<p>U.S. lawmakers questioned a JPMorgan executive last month
about the bank''s handling of MF Global customer funds during a
hearing on that New York broker''s Oct. 31 bankruptcy, which left
a $1.6 billion shortfall in client money. </p>
<p>Diane Genova, a deputy general counsel for JPMorgan, told a
House Financial Services subcommittee that the bank contacted
Jon S. Corzine, MF Global''s former chairman and chief executive
officer, to seek written confirmation that $175 million
transferred to cover an overdraft in a London subsidiary''s
account represented only the firm''s funds. </p>
<p>MF Global General Counsel Laurie Ferber told JPMorgan the
transfer represented a withdrawal of MF Global''s own funds
held in a customer segregated account, and that we therefore did
not need to be concerned, Genova said. After rejecting the
bank''s initial request as too broad, Ferber told JPMorgan
representatives she would arrange to get a revised version of a
confirmation letter signed, Genova told lawmakers. </p>
<p>MF Global never returned a signed letter, she said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan hasn''t been accused of any wrongdoing in the MF
Global investigation. </p>

<p>Twenty-two years ago, International

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) mostly hedges
silver for clients, and large speculative bets aren''t part of
our business model, Blythe Masters, the bank''s head of global
commodities, told CNBC. </p>
<p>Market participants don''t see all our activity, and
bloggers have a misunderstanding of the nature of our
business, Masters said today in an interview on CNBC. There is
an underlying client position involved in hedge or forward
trades, she said on CNBC. </p>
<p>A multiyear investigation into the possibility of unlawful
acts in the silver market is continuing after regulators
analyzed more than 100,000 documents, the U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission said in November. </p>
<p>Silver futures for May delivery rose 2.2 percent to close
at $31.73 an ounce today. The price has dropped 36 percent from
a 31-year high of $49.845 on April 25, 2011. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, based in New York, and HSBC Holdings Plc were
sued in October 2010 by investors, including Peter Laskaris, who
alleged that starting in March 2008, the banks manipulated
silver in futures and options, partly by placing so-called spoof
trading orders. </p>
<p>The banks reduced their collusive trading and their
holdings in futures market after a government investigation
began in 2008, according to the complaint by Laskaris. </p>
<h2>Suits Pending </h2>
<p>In September, investors said in a consolidated class-action
complaint that they had signed a tolling agreement with HSBC and
weren''t naming the bank as a defendant. </p>
<p>Tolling agreements are often used to stop statutes of
limitation from running while the parties discuss settlement or
dismissal of a claim. </p>
<p>The Laskaris case is one of about 45 similar suits pending
in federal court in Manhattan, where they have been transferred
for pretrial proceedings. </p>
<p>Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the drugmaker that''s
fired 26,000 workers in three years, is cutting its employee
severance package after May 14, according to an internal memo. </p>
<p>The world''s biggest pharmaceutical company has been focused
on trimming costs since it acquired Wyeth in January 2009. This
year, Pfizer is wrestling with sales losses after its biggest
product, the cholesterol drug Lipitor with $9.6 billion in 2011
sales, began facing generic competition for the first time. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Ian Read, who took over in December
2010, has pledged to cut $1 billion from operations in 2012. The
memo says basic severance pay will be lowered to eight weeks
from 12 for U.S. workers, and that health benefits will last
eight weeks rather than a year. Employees get additional weeks
of pay and health insurance the longer they''ve been with the
company. The memo was supplied to Bloomberg by a Pfizer
employee, and confirmed by Joan Campion, a spokeswoman. </p>
<p>Our benefits continue to be competitive when compared
against those offered by our industry peers and other leading
global companies, the memo said. We will continue to analyze
all of our benefit programs to support our long-term
competitiveness and the sustainability of benefits in today''s
challenging business environment. </p>
<p>Pfizer, based in New York, trimmed 20 percent of the
combined workforce after acquiring Wyeth, Chief Financial
Officer Frank D''Amelio said in an interview in January. In 2011,
Pfizer cut $642 million, or 5 percent, from expenses, the
company has said. </p>
<p>Other parts of the drugmaker''s employee severance package,
including a 60-day notice and a $5,000 retraining program, will
remain in place, according to the memo. </p>
<p>Pfizer shares fell less than 1 percent to $22.34 at the
close of New York trading. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), the investment bank
that added clawback rules to compensation packages in 2008,
expanded the types of pay that managers can be forced to return
and the list of misconduct that might trigger a penalty. </p>
<p>All long-term incentive pay for top executives named in the
annual compensation table will be covered by the new rules, the
New York-based firm said today in a proxy statement. Some lower-
level employees also are subject to the policy. A clawback could
be caused by an act or omission that triggers a restatement, or
when the person violates risk policies and standards, even if
the impact on results is favorable, Morgan Stanley said. </p>
<p>They seem to be a first-mover in terms of being extremely
aggressive in the clawback provisions, said Joseph Sorrentino,
a managing director at Steven Hall  Partners, a compensation-
consulting firm. You''re likely to see other financial-services
firms adopt something similar. </p>
<p>The 2008 credit crisis and bailout of the financial
industry has put pressure on banks to tie compensation more
closely to actual results. Regulators criticized pay systems
that awarded bonuses upfront on transactions that turned out to
be disastrously unprofitable in later years. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley can take back deferred cash-based awards if
the managers cause substantial financial loss on a trading
strategy, investment, commitment or other holding originating
either in the current year or in any prior year, the bank
said. Long-term incentive awards can be canceled for cause,
which includes failing to meet compliance, ethics or risk-
management standards. </p>
<h2>Dodd-Frank Act </h2>
<p>All employees that received a deferred-cash bonus are
subject to the expanded rules, said Mark Lake, a spokesman for
the firm. Morgan Stanley has used its clawback provision to
recoup pay since it was first implemented, he said, without
disclosing how often that has happened. </p>
<p>Some firms are waiting for clawback rules resulting from
the Dodd-Frank Act, which the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission may propose this year, Sorrentino said. While
restatement triggers are common, it''s unique to have
clawbacks for violating risk policies even when the impact on
results is favorable, he said. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer James Gorman''s compensation for
2011 totaled $10.5 million, a 25 percent cut from 2010 as the
firm''s shares fell by almost half. Morgan Stanley cut 2011 pay
for senior investment bankers and traders by an average of 20
percent to 30 percent and capped immediate cash bonuses at
$125,000, according to people briefed on the plans. </p>
<p>Total compensation for each member of the firm''s operating
committee decreased at least 20 percent, and all members won''t
receive an immediate cash bonus, one of the people said. </p>
<h2>Missed Goals </h2>
<p>The company did not fully meet all of our priorities for
the year -- which is reflected in the 2011 compensation
decisions, Morgan Stanley said in the proxy. The firm posted a
4 percent return on equity in 2011, below Gorman''s goal of
mid-teens. </p>
<p>Gorman, 53, got $5.04 million in restricted shares, and
$1.94 million in stock tied to company performance, according to
the proxy filing. He also received a deferred cash bonus of
$2.72 million that can be clawed back, in addition to his
$800,000 salary. </p>
<p>The cancellation and clawback periods can last three years,
according to the proxy. Morgan Stanley also lowered the maximum
payout executives could receive from performance stock units, or
PSUs, while making it easier for the firm to reach the return on
equity target that determines half the award. </p>
<h2>Pay Limits </h2>
<p>Top managers can only earn a maximum of 1.5 times the
stated amount of PSUs awarded for 2011 performance, down from 2
times in previous years, to discourage excessive risk-taking,
the firm said today. It lowered the return on equity the company
must achieve for executives to earn their stated amount to 10
percent from 12 percent, and reduced the minimum ROE that would
result in any award to 6 percent from 7.5 percent. </p>
<p>Ruth Porat, 54, Morgan Stanley''s chief financial officer,
received $8.75 million in total compensation for 2011, dropping
from $11.5 million in 2010. The package included $3.2 million in
restricted stock, $3.2 million in deferred cash, $1.6 million in
shares tied to company performance and a $750,000 salary. </p>
<p>Greg Fleming, 49, who runs the firm''s retail-brokerage and
asset-management units, got $9.25 million. Paul J. Taubman, 51,
and Colm Kelleher, 54, who together run the firm''s investment
banking and trading division, also each received $9.25 million. </p>
<p>The firm reported compensation that the board granted based
on 2011 performance, with some of the funds scheduled to be
received in later years. The SEC mandates a disclosure of what
executive officers actually got during the calendar year, which
can include grants from previous years that came due. By that
measure, Gorman''s package for 2011 was $13 million. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley said it nominated Alcoa Inc. CEO Klaus Kleinfeld to join its board of directors. Kleinfeld will replace
Sprint Nextel Corp. Chairman James H. Hance, who notified the
company March 30 that he won''t stand for re-election at the
annual meeting on May 15. </p>

<p>PetroVietnam Finance Joint-Stock
Co. (PVF), which makes loans and helps arrange investments in local
companies, plans to raise as much as 8 trillion dong ($384
million) from bond sales this year as high interest rates make
bank loans more expensive. </p>
<p>The company is seeking approval from the country''s central
bank to sell 5 trillion dong of three- to five-year notes as
early as this quarter, chief executive officer Nguyen Thien Bao
said in an interview in Hanoi April 4. It also plans to sell 3
trillion dong of convertible bonds this year, he said. The
bonds'' coupons will be determined by market conditions, Bao
said. </p>
<p>PetroVietnam Finance, backed by Morgan Stanley, joins
Joint-Stock Bank for Foreign Trade of Vietnam, or Vietcombank,
Vincom Joint-Stock Co. (VIC) and Vietnam Joint Stock Commercial Bank
for Industry and Trade, known as VietinBank, in seeking to raise
money by accessing debt capital markets as higher interest rates
make borrowing from domestic banks more costly. </p>
<p>Bank loans are costly due to higher rates and banks are
cautious, lending only to long-standing customers, said Alan
Pham, the chief economist at VinaCapital Investment Management
Ltd. Issuing new shares dilutes the value for existing
shareholders. So out of the three sources of funding, the bond
market is the best choice. </p>
<p>High borrowing costs and limited access to credit led
to a 6 percent increase in the number of companies closing in
the first quarter from a year earlier, Vu Duc Dam, chairman of
the Government Office, said April 1. Banks in Vietnam are also
hobbled by soured loans, which the government is trying to
address by buying bad-debt from commercial banks to strengthen
their balance sheets. </p>
<h2>Earnings Targets </h2>
<p>The government cut its credit growth target to as low as 15
percent this year from less than 20 percent in 2011. Vietnam''s
loans expanded 13 percent last year, according to the central
bank. Policy makers raised the refinancing rate to 15 percent
from 9 percent at the start of last year, before lowering it to
14 percent on March 12. </p>
<p>PetroVietnam Finance, a unit of Vietnam Oil  Gas Group,
expects pretax profit to rise 20 percent to 660 billion dong
this year, Bao said at the company''s headquarters in Hanoi.
Revenue is forecast to fall to 6.9 trillion dong from 8 trillion
dong last year, he said. Morgan Stanley holds a 10 percent stake
in the company, according to PetroVietnam Finance''s website. </p>
<p>Vietcombank, the country''s largest lender by market value,
said last month it plans to sell as much as $1 billion of 10-
year bonds internationally as early as 2012. VietinBank also
said it will offer as much as $2 billion of notes this year. </p>
<p>Refrigeration Electrical Engineering Corp. (REE) said in March it
will sell 557.8 billion dong of convertible bonds in the second
quarter to its strategic partners, while real estate developer
Vincom JSC sold $185 million of convertible bonds in March. </p>
<h2>Singapore Listing </h2>
<p>PetroVietnam Finance will cancel its Singapore listing plan
because the company currently doesn''t see any benefits from
listing overseas, Bao said. The company had initially planned to
list its shares on the Singapore Exchange in the second quarter
of 2010. </p>
<p>The company is also advising investors from Japan and Korea
on purchasing stakes in Vietnamese companies and expects to help
manage two to three deals with an average value of about $100
million to $200 million each, Bao said. </p>

<p>Jes Staley, chief executive officer
of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s investment bank, beat his Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) counterpart in compensation after boosting
earnings during last year''s market slump. </p>
<p>Staley''s $16 million award for 2011 almost held steady from
the $17 million he made the previous year as profit at the
firm''s investment bank climbed 2.3 percent to $6.8 billion. Bank
of America co-chief operating officer Thomas K. Montag''s pay
dropped 25 percent to $12 million after profit at the lender''s
investment bank plunged by more than half to $2.97 billion. </p>
<p>The 55-year-old executives, who received almost the same
amount for 2010, saw their pay diverge as the firms navigated
turmoil created by the European debt crisis. While clients
gravitated toward JPMorgan because it was considered a safe
harbor, Bank of America executives traveled the world to
reassure customers after the firm''s credit grades were cut in
September, the leaders have said. </p>
<p>Jes probably deserved to make more money, though paying
him more would send the wrong signal politically, said Gustavo Dolfino, a former UBS AG banker and now president of Whiterock
Group LLC, a New York-based executive search firm. It was a
different ballgame at Bank of America. Montag is a decent guy,
but he is under pressure. </p>

that the trades are part of the firm''s hedging strategy, four
market participants said they resemble proprietary bets, or
wagers with the lender''s own money. </p>
<p>Executives at New York-based JPMorgan, the biggest U.S.
bank with $2.27 trillion of assets at year-end, have opposed the
so-called Volcker rule that seeks to prevent banks with federal
backing from making speculative trades. Details on Iksil''s
positions are too sparse for regulators to determine whether
they should be permitted, said Frank Partnoy, a former
derivatives trader who''s now a law and finance professor at the
University of San Diego. </p>
<p>This could be an almost completely matched, hedged
position, or it could be massively risky, and there''s just no
way to tell without getting more complete disclosure, Partnoy,
author of Infectious Greed: How Deceit and Risk Corrupted the
Financial Markets said in a phone interview. I''m surprised
that regulators don''t see this example and cry out for more
disclosure and more information about these contracts. </p>
<h2>Bank Regulators </h2>
<p>Judith Burns, a Securities and Exchange Commission
spokeswoman, declined to comment on whether the agency is
looking into the trading. Bryan Hubbard, a spokesman with the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates
banking at JPMorgan, and the Federal Reserve''s Barbara Hagenbaugh also declined to comment. </p>
<p>The three regulators are among those working on the final
version of the Volcker rule. </p>
<p>Regulators are stationed in JPMorgan''s offices and are
aware of what the bank is doing, said a person familiar with the
company''s thinking, who asked not to be identified because he
wasn''t authorized to discuss it. </p>
<p>The results of JPMorgan''s chief investment office are
disclosed in our quarterly earnings reports and are fully
transparent, Evangelisti said in a phone interview. </p>
<p>Harvey Pitt, a former U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission chairman, said yesterday in an interview on Bloomberg
Television''s InBusiness With Margaret Brennan that trading
such as Iksil''s should raise regulatory concerns because it''s
influencing market prices. </p>

Harrington, Bradley Keoun and Christine Harper" date="Apr 09, 2012  5:08 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-09/jpmorgan-trader-iksil-fuels-prop-trading-debate-with-bets.html"><headline>JPMorgan Trader Iksil Fuels Prop-Trading Debate With Bets</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) trader Bruno Iksil''s outsized bets in credit derivatives are drawing
attention to a little-known division that invests the company''s
reserves and fueling a debate over whether banks are taking
excessive risks with federally insured and subsidized money. </p>
<p>Iksil''s influence in the market has spurred some
counterparts to dub him Voldemort, after the Harry Potter
villain. He works in London in the bank''s chief investment
office, which has assembled traders from across Wall Street to
its staff of 400 who help oversee $350 billion in investments.
While the firm describes the unit''s main task as hedging risks
and investing excess cash, four hedge-fund managers and dealers
say the trades are big enough to move indexes and resemble
proprietary bets, or wagers made with the bank''s own money. </p>
<p>The trades, first reported by Bloomberg News April 5,
stirred debate among U.S. policy makers over the Easter-holiday
weekend as they wrangle over this year''s implementation of the
so-called Volcker rule, the portion of the Dodd-Frank Act that
sets limits on risk-taking by banks with government backing. The
law passed after the collapse of the subprime mortgage market
triggered the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. (INDU) </p>
<p>I wouldn''t be surprised if the pro-Volcker folks used
this as a test case, said Douglas Landy, a partner at law firm
Allen  Overy LLP who is representing Canadian banks in opposing
a current draft of the rule. </p>
<h2>Merkley, Miller </h2>
<p>Senator Jeff Merkley criticized the transactions in a
statement that called for the rule''s prompt implementation,
while Representative Brad Miller said they show why related U.S.
laws should apply internationally. </p>
<p>Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment on Iksil''s specific transactions, and Iksil
didn''t respond to phone messages and e-mails seeking comment.
Neither Iksil nor JPMorgan have been accused of wrongdoing, and
the full extent of his trading and the bank''s total risk of
loss, or total gain, on his investments isn''t known. </p>
<p>Authorities will need more information from JPMorgan, the
biggest U.S. bank by assets, to discern the precise purpose of
Iksil''s transactions, said Clifford Rossi, an executive-in-
residence at the University of Maryland''s Robert H. Smith School
of Business. </p>
<p>It clearly calls attention to the Volcker issue, said
Rossi, who previously was a managing director at Citigroup Inc. </p>
<h2>Competitive Issues </h2>
<p>Arthur Levitt, the former chairman of the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission, said banks may be required to reveal
more specifics about their derivatives holdings in order for
regulators to enforce the Volcker rule. </p>
<p>That''s unfortunate, Levitt said today in an interview
on Bloomberg Radio''s Bloomberg Surveillance with Ken Prewitt
and Tom Keene. That raises all kinds of competitive issues. </p>
<p>Levitt is a board member of Bloomberg LP, the parent of
Bloomberg News, and a senior adviser to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>Harvey Pitt, also a former SEC chairman, said he would ask
JPMorgan to explain the trades and then have the agency report
to the public. </p>
<p>Any time any trader can be dominant in the marketplace,
that has to raise appropriate regulatory concerns, Pitt said
today in a phone interview on Bloomberg Television''s
InBusiness With Margaret Brennan program. That means the
markets can be influenced by a single actor, and that is not the
way our markets ought to operate. </p>
<h2>Dimon''s Letter </h2>
<p>JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56, sent a
38-page letter to shareholders last week, saying he agrees with
the Volcker rule''s intent to eliminate pure proprietary
trading and ensure market-making won''t jeopardize banks. Still,
as with derivatives laws, the rule must be written so that it
doesn''t put U.S. banks at a global disadvantage, he said. </p>
<p>We cannot and should not be in a position where the rule
affects U.S. banks outside the United States but not our foreign
competition, he wrote. </p>
<p>Iksil drew attention from market professionals in recent
months as trading accelerated in a group of credit-default-swap
indexes created before and during the 2008 financial crisis.
Until then, transactions had been dwindling as Wall Street banks
stopped creating structured debt that the indexes were used to
hedge against. Investors use credit-default swaps to shield
themselves from losses on corporate debt or to speculate on a
firm''s creditworthiness. </p>
<h2>London Whale'' </h2>
<p>The trader became such a big client of credit-derivatives
dealers that some started calling him Voldemort, the Harry
Potter book-series villain so powerful he simply was referred to
as He Who Must Not Be Named, said one fund manager, who
asked not to be identified because his firm does business with
JPMorgan. Iksil also has been dubbed the London whale,
another trader said. </p>
<p>Iksil joined JPMorgan in 2005, according to his career-
history record with the U.K. Financial Services Authority. He
worked at the French investment bank Natixis (KN) from 1999 to 2003,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Public records showing
Iksil''s date of birth couldn''t be located. One person who has
done business with Iksil said he''s in his late 30s. </p>
<p>When a group of hedge-fund traders last year bet that a
cluster of companies in one of the indexes wouldn''t default
before contracts expired in December, Iksil was taking the
opposite view, according to four market participants at hedge
funds and banks, who spoke on condition of anonymity because
they aren''t authorized to discuss the transactions. </p>
<h2>Concentrated Risks </h2>
<p>Iksil''s bet won out, and the hedge funds faced losses of 25
percent, when American Airlines parent AMR Corp. filed for
bankruptcy less than a month before the insurance-like swaps
matured, the market participants said. The trades were made in
so-called tranches of the index, which take concentrated risks
on the member companies. </p>
<p>This year, Iksil has been betting on an index of 121
companies that all had investment-grade ratings when the
benchmark was created in September 2007, the market participants
said. Trading in that index surged 61 percent the past three
months, according to data from Depository Trust  Clearing Corp. </p>
<p>The net amount of wagers on the index, which is tied to the
creditworthiness of companies such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and
now-junk-rated bond insurer MBIA Insurance Corp., soared to
almost $145 billion at the end of March from $90 billion three
months earlier, according to DTCC, which runs a central registry
for credit-default swaps and reports weekly aggregate volumes. </p>
<p>Iksil''s trades have been so large that they''re widening
gaps between the relative value of the indexes and the average
price of contracts tied to companies in those indexes, according
to the market participants. That has frustrated some hedge funds
that had bet the gaps would close, the people said. </p>
<h2>First Quarter </h2>
<p>Iksil has been selling default-protection on the index
using swaps that expire in December 2017, meaning he would cover
the counterparty''s losses if a company in the index fails, the
market participants said. The price of the index falls as more
insurance is sold against it. The index declined 38 basis points
in the first three months of 2012, the biggest quarterly drop
since 2009. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. </p>
<p>The positions, by the bank''s calculations, amount to tens
of billions of dollars and were built with the knowledge of
Iksil''s superiors, a person familiar with the firm''s view said. </p>
<p>Iksil may have built a position totaling as much as $100
billion in contracts in one index, according to the market
participants, who said they based their estimates on the trades
and price movements they witnessed as well as their
understanding of the size and structure of the markets. </p>
<h2>Buying Protection </h2>
<p>The trade on the index, known as the Markit CDX North
America Investment Grade Series 9 (IBOXUG09), probably isn''t a one-way bet,
the people said. Iksil may be offsetting the trade by buying
protection on the same index with contracts that expire about
eight months from now, the people said. That strategy would pay
JPMorgan the difference between the long-dated contracts and the
short-dated ones, about 47 basis points as of April 6, and the
trade would gain when the gap narrows. The hedge would end in
December unless another trade is made to replace it. </p>
<p>Someone in that position at JPMorgan would typically not
be doing pure speculation but would be involved in strategic
risk management for the firm, Darrell Duffie, a professor at
Stanford University''s graduate school of business, said in a
telephone interview. </p>
<p>JPMorgan profited from a similar strategy as the credit
crisis erupted in 2008 by buying protection on short-dated
contracts linked to high-yield indexes while selling protection
on longer-dated contracts, a bet that a spike in corporate
defaults would happen sooner than markets were pricing in,
according to a February letter to regulators from Barry Zubrow,
the bank''s head of corporate and regulatory affairs. </p>
<h2>Losses Reduced </h2>
<p>This strategy resulted in the firm recognizing some gains
as near-term default risks increased, Zubrow wrote. The
gains recognized on these derivatives strategies offset in part
the losses that occurred on credit assets held by the firm. </p>
<p>Zubrow said the trade, which was booked in the bank''s
market risk capital trading account, was a hedge that may have
been banned under the Volcker rule. </p>
<p>The chief investment office''s revenue swelled following the
financial crisis as federal regulators pushed banks to keep more
of their funds in liquid investments, and as deposits flooded in
because of JPMorgan''s reputation as one of the industry''s
strongest banks. Total securities holdings in the corporate
segment, which includes the chief investment office and
treasury, more than quadrupled to $340.2 billion in 2009 from
$76.5 billion in 2007. </p>
<h2>Bigger Pool </h2>
<p>The extra liquidity meant a bigger pool of money for the
chief investment office to manage -- and more revenue. The
bank''s annual report for 2009 showed $6.63 billion of revenue
for the corporate segment, up from $4.42 billion in 2007. It
cited the chief investment office''s significant purchases of
mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by U.S. government
agencies, corporate debt securities, U.S. Treasury and
government agency securities and other asset-backed
securities. </p>
<p>Revenue in the corporate segment climbed again in 2010, to
$7.42 billion, reflecting a repositioning of the portfolio in
response to changes in the interest-rate environment and to
rebalance exposure, JPMorgan said in a regulatory filing. The
bank rewarded Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew with a $15
million pay package for 2010, saying in a shareholder letter
that she was instrumental in setting the course and directing
the firm''s repositioning of the balance sheet. </p>
<h2>Revenue Tumbled </h2>
<p>Last year, revenue tumbled 44 percent to $4.14 billion in
the corporate segment, driven by repositioning of the
investment securities portfolio and lower funding benefits from
financing the portfolio, according to an annual filing. Drew,
55, got a 6.8 percent pay cut to $14 million, the bank said in a
regulatory filing last week. Her pay for the past two years was
higher than that of Chief Financial Officer Doug Braunstein.
Drew referred a request for comment to Evangelisti. </p>
<p>The chief investment office is affiliated with the bank''s
treasury, helping to control market risks and investing excess
funds, according to the lender''s annual report. </p>
<p>The chief investment office is responsible for managing
and hedging the firm''s foreign-exchange, interest-rate and other
structural risks, Evangelisti said. It''s focused on managing
the long-term structural assets and liabilities of the firm and
is not focused on short-term profits. </p>
<p>Some people hired by the group have come with risk-taking
pedigrees. Irene Tse, 42, a former portfolio manager at Stanley Druckenmiller''s now-closed hedge fund, Duquesne Capital
Management, joined last year as the group''s head in North
America, reporting to Drew. Achilles Macris, 51, a former co-
head of capital markets at German bank Dresdner Kleinwort
Wasserstein, runs the group in Europe and Asia. </p>
<h2>Experience, Connections </h2>
<p>A search through profiles on the LinkedIn professional-
networking website shows current and former executives in the
chief investment office citing their proprietary-trading
experience and connections. </p>
<p>One executive who worked as a portfolio manager in
JPMorgan''s chief investment office said he ran what he called a
proprietary macro and relative-value trading book that produced
a 12 percent return on capital. An executive director wrote that
before he worked in fixed-income trading in the office, he was a
vice president in proprietary trading at JPMorgan. </p>
<p>A technology specialist who worked in the chief investment
office in New York in 2009 and 2010 wrote that he led New York
development and business analysis for a proprietary-trading
risk-management system. </p>
<p>The Volcker rule is supposed to take effect in July, though
regulators are still determining how it will make exceptions for
instances where firms are hedging to curtail risk in their
lending and trading businesses. </p>
<h2>Illuminate the Risk'' </h2>
<p>Iksil''s big bets illuminate the risk inherent in hedge
fund-style trading, said Senator Merkley of Oregon, who added
the Volcker rule to Dodd-Frank along with Senator Carl Levin, a
fellow Democrat from Michigan. If the trades collapse, Merkley
said, you want the resulting meltdown to happen outside of the
banks we depend on for loans to families and businesses. </p>
<p>After the Republican-controlled U.S. House of
Representatives returns from a spring recess, members are set to
vote on a bill that would limit Dodd-Frank clearing, trading and
collateral regulations from applying to trades between foreign-
based affiliates of U.S. banks and their overseas clients. </p>
<p>The JPMorgan trades are an example of why such exceptions
are misguided, said Representative Miller, a North Carolina
Democrat who sits on the Financial Services Committee. </p>
<h2>Miller''s Vote </h2>
<p>Even if these trades are done in London and even if they
are done by a foreign affiliate, there''s no doubt that JPMorgan
would be liable and that any solvency issue would be visited
upon the U.S. and the U.S. economy and the U.S. taxpayer, said
Miller, who voted against the bill at a preliminary stage in the
committee. </p>
<p>Even without regulatory scrutiny, reports that Iksil''s
trades were so large that they moved market prices are likely to
concern JPMorgan, Stanford University''s Duffie said. </p>
<p>If the trades were indeed part of a risk management
strategy, then the intent wouldn''t be to move markets, Duffie
said. The most obvious remedy is to reduce the extent to which
they put on such large trading positions in the future. </p>

<p>A dozen top Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)
designers convened in a conference room at their company
headquarters in February 2010 and studied a collage of product
screen shots plastered along a 40-foot wall. </p>
<p>People who were there said that while the gadgets and
software looked nice by themselves, they appeared to have little
in common when viewed all at once. </p>
<p>It felt like we didn''t really know what our soul was or
our design ethos, said Sam Moreau, who oversees Windows
design. When we put it all up on the wall, it became amazingly
evident that we didn''t have a voice. </p>
<p>Moreau and the 11 other managers in that room are racing to
give the company''s products a more cohesive -- and alluring --
design. Drawing inspiration from signs in hubs like the London
Underground that use simple symbols to orient travelers, the
Metro design uses bright colors and basic shapes to help users
navigate phones, tablets and computers. The quest to use design
to boost sales is made more urgent as Microsoft plays catch-up
in tablets and phones to Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. </p>
<p>It''s a really good thing that Microsoft finally stepped
up and created a design language that''s their own, said Mark
Rolston,  chief creative officer at Frog Design Inc., which
designed some of Apple''s early products, such as the Apple IIc
case. They did ape existing products too much. They never aped
out in the open, they just quietly longed to be respected in the
way Apple is. But they will only get respect when they step out
on their own. </p>
<h2>Phones, Tablets, Xboxes </h2>
<p>Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, will showcase
Metro in its Windows 8 software, due to be released this year
for tablets and personal computers, and is considering weaving
Metro into the hardware of the Xbox gaming console. Metro is
already featured in Xbox and Windows Phone software. </p>
<p>Metro does away with Microsoft''s traditional operating
system design, with its rows of clickable icons and applications
that open in window-shaped boxes bedecked by tool bars and drop-
down menus. Metro''s start screen boasts boldly colored, touch-
enabled square and rectangular tiles for each application --say,
a Web browser or an online store. Navigable by touch, the
applications fill the screen and the start-page tiles update
automatically with new information, such as a weather forecast. </p>
<p>It reflects a philosophy intended to put emphasis on
information, rather than ornamentation. </p>
<h2>Design Matters </h2>
<p>It''s a very gutsy move, said Gadi Amit, principal
designer at NewDealDesign, the San Francisco-based design agency
behind products like the Slingbox video player and the Fitbit
activity tracker. In two-three years people will look at it
and say this is actually a major shift in design strategy. </p>
<p>In an industry once dominated by large, beige office
computers, design has become increasingly important for
consumers who purchase devices for use during leisure time and
sport them like fashion accessories, said Steve Kaneko, who has
been a Microsoft designer for two decades and attended the 2010
meeting. Microsoft needed to sharpen its design and be seen less
as a follower to contend with companies such as Apple that have
won praise for the look and feel of products, Rolston said. </p>
<p>Apple has become the world''s most valuable company in part
because of the allure of products characterized by sleek design
and easy-to-use features. Google (GOOG), with a Spartan home page,
became the world''s top Web search provider as Yahoo! Inc. and
Microsoft buried their search tools in cluttered portal pages. </p>
<h2>Mouse at MoMA </h2>
<p>Over the almost three decades that Microsoft has made
hardware, its products have won many design awards, including
eight International Design Excellence Awards last year. A
Microsoft mouse designed by Kaneko is in the permanent
collection at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. </p>
<p>Still, the company has failed to establish a reputation
among consumers for excellent design. Many products looked
focus-grouped, as though too many opinions went into their
design, Kaneko said. </p>
<p>The Kin phone, for instance, won design awards, yet it
flopped with consumers and spent just two months in stores.
Windows Phone won a gold International Design Excellence Award
for interactive product experiences in 2011, as well as the
People''s Choice award from the same organization that year.
Still, Microsoft accounted for only 3.9 percent of the U.S.
market for smartphone operating systems at the end of February,
according to ComScore Inc. </p>
<p>With Metro taking over so many Microsoft products, it''s
critical that users like it. Microsoft Chief Executive Officer
Steve Ballmer refers to key releases as bet-the-company
products. Metro has become a bet-the-company design, said
Kaneko. </p>
<p>We don''t flinch about that commitment, he said. </p>
<h2>Limiting Minimalism'' </h2>
<p>Rolston, of Frog Design, said the design is too imposing
and will inhibit outside developers from attempting to build a
broad range of applications that work with the software. </p>
<p>They tried to create an interface that put content
first, he said. Ironically, what happens is that the design
itself is so aggressive and unique you can''t help but see it
first, and the minimalism can become limiting. </p>
<p>Young Kim, industrial design manager for Microsoft''s
hardware division, said it will take a while to change consumer
perceptions. </p>
<p>That trust in the brand is something we''re going to have
to earn, he said. </p>
<p>Microsoft plans to expand Metro beyond phones, tablets and
personal computers. Kaneko is working on how to translate it to
the Office package of business-productivity applications. The
company''s hardware designers are also considering the
implications for mice, keyboards and the next version of the
Xbox console, Kim said. </p>
<h2>Adding Staff </h2>
<p>The challenge there is translating the clean, modern
aesthetic of Metro without being overly literal in copying the
software interface -- say, by producing an impossible-to-hold,
square mouse, Kim said. </p>
<p>They way we designed Metro is to set us up for the next
10, 20 years, said Albert Shum, a Nike veteran who oversees
design for Windows Phone. Shum''s team has expanded too, doubling
to about 60 people in three years, with hires from places like
the Seattle Art Museum and Frog Design. </p>
<p>Metro got its name in 2009, when Shum and eight designers
locked themselves into their studio in downtown Seattle''s
Pioneer Square to work on the design for the next iteration of
Microsoft''s mobile phone. Shum said he wants his team to draw on
influences as varied as top sushi chefs and classic furniture
designers. He wants customers to view Microsoft they way they do
Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) -- as a place to get a consistent, unique and
appealing kind of experience with each visit. </p>
<h2>Subway, Traffic Signs </h2>
<p>Like the Windows Phone designers, Moreau''s group also draws
inspiration from subway, airport and traffic signs. The team''s
conference room has an entire wall covered with images from the
New York City subway, London Underground and airports across
Asia. </p>
<p>Another early influence is even more unlikely: Microsoft''s
Zune music and video player. While it met with tepid demand, it
nonetheless garnered praise for its design. </p>
<p>Since the advent of the graphical user interface, designers
have tried to help customers understand computers by modeling
graphics on tasks outside the world of technology. That explains
why the icon for discarding files became a trash can, and
Windows began using drop shadows and transparencies to give them
real-world depth. Windows 8 Metro does a complete turn with its
flat squares and lack of shadows and shading. </p>
<h2>Changing Perceptions </h2>
<p>The company, with help from the Pentagram design agency,
also overhauled the Windows logo. It replaced the older one that
looked a bit too much like a flag with a simple, blue and white
window that Amit terms poetry. </p>
<p>Windows 8 is maybe a turning point, said Amit. If
Microsoft can use the market-dominating operating system to get
critical mass for their new look, they really have a chance to
change the perception of Microsoft''s design. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s same design leadership team, plus six new
members, met at Seattle''s Space Needle earlier this year and put
the product lineup up on its wall for a second look. </p>
<p>It''s started to feel like you can see us, Moreau said.
You can see the design ethos we are working on starting to
appear. </p>

<p> Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. energy producer, said first-quarter profit exceeded the
prior quarter because of rising oil prices, widening refining
margins and the sale of fuel-marketing assets in Spain. </p>
<p>Oil and natural-gas production from company-operated wells
averaged the equivalent of 2.63 million barrels a day during
January and February, 4.9 percent lower than the daily average
for the full first-quarter of 2011, the San Ramon, California-
based company said in a statement today. Results for the full
three-month period will be announced on April 27. </p>
<p>After spending $3.2 billion last year to acquire
Appalachian gas producer Atlas Energy Inc., Chief Executive
Officer and Chairman John Watson is shifting the company''s focus
to finding crude and natural-gas liquids such as ethane that
sell at a premium to gas. Chevron will spend $32.7 billion this
year, a 12 percent increase from last year, on capital projects
including oil platforms, gas-export plants and refinery
equipment, the company said in December. </p>
<p>Brent crude futures, the benchmark for two-thirds of the
world''s oil, averaged $118.45 a barrel during the January-to-
March period, an 8.6 percent increase from the first-quarter
average and 12 percent higher than a year earlier, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>U.S. gas prices, weighed down by a glut of supply from
shale formations, tumbled to an average of $2.503 per million
British thermal units during the quarter, a 28 percent decline
from the prior period and 40 percent lower than a year earlier. </p>
<p>Chevron recorded a $200 million gain from the sale of so-
called downstream assets in Spain, according to the statement. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil Corp., based in Irving, Texas, is the largest
U.S. energy producer. </p>

<p>The city sought the bids as part of a court-approved plan

fund budget. The community backed financing for an overhaul of a
municipal incinerator which doesn''t produce enough revenue to
cover the cost of servicing the debt. The proposed sales or
leases are designed to keep Harrisburg out of bankruptcy. </p>
<p>It''s a real opportunity, and the process is attracting
bidders, said Bob Philbin, a spokesman for Mayor Linda Thompson. The number of interested parties is a very good
sign. </p>
<p>The city has 10 garages, five surface lots and 1,250
metered spaces, which provide 72 percent of municipal parking.
In 2010, the Harrisburg Parking Authority, which oversees the
system, reported $13.8 million in revenue. </p>
<p>The plan to offer assets owned by the city of 49,500
residents for sale or lease was set up by David Unkovic, the
state''s first municipal receiver, who resigned March 30 after
calling for state and federal probes of the financing for the
incinerator. A list of interested parties, dated April 2, was
posted today on the receiver''s website. </p>
<h2>Chicago Deal </h2>
<p>In Chicago, a different Morgan Stanley venture may reap
$9.58 billion in profit over a 75-year lease of city parking
facilities, based on documents from the group. The bank, joined
by the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Allianz Capital
Partners, set up a venture to lease the Chicago operations in
2008. The profit was estimated based on projections in a 2010
offering document. </p>
<p>Partnering with New York-based Morgan Stanley in Harrisburg
is Central Parking Corp. (PK) of Nashville, Tennessee, according to
documents posted on the receiver''s website. Guggenheim''s bidding
entity is named Harrisburg First. </p>
<p>CBRE Group Inc. of Los Angeles leads a consortium called
Harrisburg Forward LLC, according to the list. Other contenders
include National Development Council, a community organization,
Boenning  Scattergood Inc., a securities broker in West
Conshohocken, Pennsylvania. </p>
<h2>Ontario Pension </h2>
<p>Also listed are NW Financial Group LLC, a Jersey City, New
Jersey-based investment bank, and the Ontario Teachers'' Pension
Fund with Vancouver-based Impark Parking Corp. (2896591Q) </p>
<p>A group called Harrisburg Parking Partners LLC includes EQT
Infrastructure Ltd., part of a Stockholm-based private-equity
fund, an unnamed private-equity firm and a parking operator that
also wasn''t identified in an earlier list of interested parties. </p>
<p>Before the city was placed in receivership, EQT with New
York-based LambdaStar Infrastructure Partners LP offered to
lease Harrisburg''s parking garages and lots for either 75 years
for $215 million or 50 years for $195 million. No one at
LambdaStar responded immediately to a telephone call seeking
comment on the situation in the Pennsylvania capital. </p>
<p>Unkovic had planned to close any sale or lease transactions
by June. Governor Tom Corbett hasn''t named a new receiver. </p>
<p>The fiscal recovery blueprint from Unkovic also called for
savings from labor contracts and concessions from creditors once
the value of city assets was determined. While Thompson supports
the plan, it has been opposed by the City Council president, as
well as the elected controller and treasurer. </p>
<p>State law bars the city, where 30 percent of residents live
below poverty level, from seeking bankruptcy-court protection
before July. </p>

<p>Yoel Zaoui, named co-head of global
mergers and acquisitions at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) less than a
year ago, is leaving after 24 years at the bank, the eighth
management committee member to depart in 12 months. </p>
<p>Zaoui, a 51-year-old French citizen, will continue to
advise the firm as a senior director, according to an internal
memorandum obtained by Bloomberg. The London-based banker, who
joined in 1988, got his current post alongside Gene T. Sykes,
54, in May, according to the memo from Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd C. Blankfein and President Gary D. Cohn. Jo Carss, a
spokeswoman in London, confirmed the contents of the memo. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. based bank by assets,
is the fourth-ranked adviser on takeovers announced globally so
far this year after attaining the No. 1 position in 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Fees for takeover
advice and other financial advisory assignments fell 4 percent
last year and contributed 6.9 percent of the firm''s revenue,
according to the company''s results published in January. </p>
<p>Zaoui is credited with helping to establish the firm''s
leadership position across many markets and leading some of the
region''s most important merger transactions, according to the
memo. Yoel has built strong relationships with many of our
significant clients and has helped to recruit, mentor and
develop many of our senior banking professionals. </p>
<p>Zaoui and his older brother Michael, who ran European MA
at Morgan Stanley before retiring in 2008 after a 21-year career
at the firm, became renowned in the late 1990s for their rivalry
on some of the biggest takeover battles. Among them were
TotalFina SA''s $58 billion purchase of Elf Aquitaine SA and
Vodafone AirTouch Plc''s $137 billion hostile bid for Germany''s
Mannesmann AG in 1999. </p>
<h2>Zaoui''s Deals </h2>
<p>Zaoui also advised on deals including the 2004 merger that
created French pharmaceuticals maker Sanofi and the 2006
combination of Arcelor and Mittal. He didn''t reply to an e-mail
and phone message seeking comment. </p>
<p>Takeover advice was a bigger portion of revenue a decade
ago, contributing 16 percent of Goldman Sachs''s top line in 2000
and 17 percent in 1999, according to company reports. Sales and
trading, which generated 39 percent of 2000 revenue, swelled to
60 percent of 2011 revenue, according to company reports. </p>
<p>Born in Morocco, Zaoui grew up in Rome and Paris, where he
was educated at HEC Paris and Universite Paris-Dauphine, and
received a master''s degree in business administration from
Stanford University''s Graduate School of Business before joining
Goldman Sachs in New York in 1988. He moved to London one year
later, where he helped build the company''s European mergers-and-
acquisitions practice under the leadership of John Thornton. </p>
<h2>Moving Up </h2>
<p>Zaoui was promoted to co-head of European mergers in 1999,
the year that Goldman Sachs became Europe''s top adviser on
hostile takeovers, and in 2006 was promoted to run all of
European investment banking. In February 2008 he was among nine
Goldman Sachs executives named to the management committee. Five
of those partners including Zaoui are among eight committee
members who have left in the last 12 months. </p>
<p>Richard M. Ruzika, who joined in 1982, left the bank last
April and was followed later in the year by Yusuf A. Alireza,
Edward C. Forst and Kevin W. Kennedy. Edward K. Eisler, David B. Heller and Donald R. Mullen Jr.''s departures were all announced
earlier this year. </p>
<p>Excluding Zaoui, the management committee currently has 28
members. </p>
<p>The departures of Goldman Sachs bankers Luca Ferrari, who
advised Xstrata Plc on its proposed merger with Glencore
International Plc, and New York-based partners George Mattson
and Jeffrey Moslow were announced in February. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) isn''t entitled to
protection from some asbestos claims related to its non-
operating bankrupt Quigley Co. unit, according to a federal
appeals court ruling. </p>
<p>Quigley, founded in 1916, made three products for the steel
industry from the 1940s to the 1970s that contained asbestos.
Pfizer bought Quigley in 1968, and the company stopped most
operations in 1992, filing for bankruptcy in 2004. Pfizer has
said it never made or sold any Quigley products, and some
claimants hadn''t released Pfizer from alleged derivative
liability. </p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart Bernstein that found Quigley''s
bankruptcy barred certain lawsuits against Pfizer. A May 2011
decision in district court reversed the order, and Pfizer had
appealed that ruling. </p>
<p>We affirm the district court, three judges said in
today''s ruling that upheld the May decision. In doing so, they
found that the law firm Peter G. Angelos can sue Pfizer based on
manufacturer liability under Pennsylvania law. </p>
<p>Angelos began bringing lawsuits against Pfizer in 1999,
saying that because the drug company''s logo appeared on Quigley
products, it should have liability for the asbestos-containing
products. </p>
<h2>Evaluating Options </h2>
<p>Christopher Loder, a spokesman for Pfizer, said the company
was disappointed in the court''s decision and is evaluating its
options. </p>
<p>It is important to note that the court''s ruling is
procedural and does not address the merits of the underlying
claims, which we strongly dispute, Loder said: In the
history of this litigation, Pfizer has never been found
derivatively or directly liable for injuries allegedly caused by
Quigley''s asbestos-containing products. </p>
<p>During Quigley''s bankruptcy, a committee of creditors known
as the Ad Hoc Committee of Tort Victims asked in October
2010 to have Quigley''s bankruptcy dismissed so it could bring
tort claims, which are otherwise blocked by bankruptcy law. </p>
<p>Bernstein had said that Pfizer had manipulated the
bankruptcy process, and refused to allow Quigley to exit Chapter
11 court protection under a deal with Pfizer. </p>
<p>Asbestos claims against Quigley may total $4.45 billion
during the next 42 years, according to testimony cited by
Bernstein in September 2011. In November of that year, Pfizer
reported a $701 million third-quarter charge for asbestos
litigation related to Quigley. </p>
<p>Lawyers for the U.S. Trustee, an arm of the Justice
Department, had asked the bankruptcy court to end Quigley''s
Chapter 11, citing the fact that creditors alleging asbestos-
related health issues have been unable to sue New York-based
Pfizer during the case, and many of them have died. </p>
<p>The case is In re Quigley Co., 04-15739, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The appeals
case is 11-2635, 11-2767, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
(Manhattan). </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. bought two North Sea
Forties (EUCSFORT) crude cargoes at higher prices, bringing its total
purchases for April-loading shipments to three. No bids or
offers were made for Russian Urals in Europe. </p>
<p>BP Plc resumed operation at its Valhall oil and natural-gas
field in the Norwegian North Sea after maintenance, according to
the company. </p>
<h2>North Sea </h2>
<p>Chevron bought one Forties cargo for April 22 to April 24
loading from Vitol Group at 35 cents a barrel more than Dated
Brent (EUCRBRDT), and another for April 24 to April 26 from Royal Dutch
Shell Plc at a premium of 50 cents to the benchmark, according
to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the
Platts trading window. On April 5, a cargo for April 18 to April
20 was sold at 20 cents more than Dated Brent. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley didn''t manage to buy Forties for May 1 to
May 6 loading at 25 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, the
survey showed. </p>
<p>Trafigura Beheer BV was unable to sell Forties for April 27
to April 29 at 45 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, while
Total SA didn''t find buyers for May 2 to May 4 loading at 55
cents a barrel, according to the survey. </p>
<p>Total also failed to sell Forties on a ship-to-ship basis
from the tankers Stena Natalita or Eagle Tuscon. It offered at
60 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent for April 20 to April 25
transfer, or a premium of 80 cents for April 24 to April 30,
according to the survey. </p>
<p>Reported North Sea trading typically occurs during the
Platts window, which typically ends at 4:30 p.m. London time.
Before the session, Forties loading in 10 to 25 days was 34
cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, compared with a premium of
17 cents on April 5, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Brent for May settlement traded at $121.07 a barrel on the
ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, down from $121.23 yesterday. The June contract was at
$120.63, a discount of 44 cents to May. </p>
<p>Valhall is back in production following the shutdown for
maintenance work, Mark Salt, a London-based spokesman for BP,
said in an e-mailed response today. Output from the field
started on April 7 and is at normal levels of about 40,000
barrels a day of oil equivalent, he said. </p>
<p>BP shut the field at the end of March to repair a
compressor unit. </p>
<p>A Forties cargo with parcel number F0414 was delayed by one
day to load from April 19., according to three people with
knowledge of the export program. This brings total deferrals for
this month to 10 lots. </p>
<p>Exports of North Sea Flotta crude will be 1.2 million
barrels in May, compared with 1.3 million barrels in April,
according to a loading schedule obtained by Bloomberg News. </p>
<h2>Mediterranean/Urals </h2>
<p>Urals (EUCSURNW) was at $2.77 a barrel less than Dated Brent in
northwest Europe, compared with a discount of $3.58 in the
previous session, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
grade traded on April 5 at $2.80 less than Dated Brent for
delivery to Rotterdam. </p>
<p>Saudi Arabian Oil Co. will supply full volumes in May to
customers in Europe, unchanged from this month, according to two
refinery officials with knowledge of the matter. </p>
<h2>West Africa </h2>
<p>Indian Oil Corp. issued its first tender to buy crude for
loading in June, a document obtained by Bloomberg News showed.
The tender closes on April 11 and offers are valid until the
following day. </p>
<p>Bharat Petroleum Corp. sought to buy crude for loading from
June 1 to June 15, according to a separate tender document. It
closes on April 16, with offers valid until April 17. </p>
<p>Nigeria''s benchmark Qua Iboe (AFCSQUA1) blend was at a premium of
$2.36 a barrel to Dated Brent, down from $2.45 on April 5,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world''s
largest entertainment company, formed a partnership with Tencent
Holdings Ltd. (700) and a Chinese state group to develop animation
content for the country and the international market. </p>
<p>Andy Bird, chairman of Walt Disney International, signed an
agreement in Beijing with Tencent, China''s biggest Internet
company, and the Ministry of Culture''s China Animation Group,
the Burbank, California-based company said in a statement today.
Disney will help train local talent and develop original content
for television, movies and digital platforms, it said. </p>
<p>In February, the U.S. and China reached an agreement that
gives U.S. filmmakers improved access to a $2.1 billion box-office market in the world''s most populous nation. Tencent may
be able to benefit from the partnership by strengthening its
existing businesses such as online gaming, according to Bill Huang, a Shanghai-based analyst at DBS Vickers Securities. </p>
<p>One of the things Tencent can do through this cooperation
is to foster animation-related intellectual property on its own
platforms, said Huang. But I can hardly see any meaningful
near-term earnings contribution. </p>
<p>China is one of the world''s fastest growing film markets.
In 2010, the Asia Pacific box office grew by 21 percent with
China accounting for 40 percent of the growth, the Motion
Picture Association of America said in February 2011. </p>
<p>Under today''s agreement, Disney will provide its expertise
in storytelling from concept creation and story development to
market research, the company said. </p>
<p>China said in December it will give tax breaks to emerging
cultural'' industries and has provided preferential tax policies
to animation and digital television companies. Greater
development of the media and cultural industries was set as a
national target in the government''s 12th five-year plan that
covers the period from 2011 through 2015. </p>

<p>For the 33,000 residents of
Cassino, the Italian town''s attempt to cut its borrowing costs
using derivatives was a losing bet the moment it was struck. The
Wall Street bank that created the deal reaped an instant profit. </p>
<p>Cassino, flattened during World War II, signed a contract
with Bear Stearns Cos. (BSC) in 2003 to swap the fixed rates it was
paying on 22.5 million euros ($29.5 million) of debt for a
variable rate, according to documents obtained by Bloomberg News
last month under a court ruling. After the cost of the swap
spiraled, the town sued JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), which bought Bear
Stearns in 2008, and the bank paid to end the contract, leaving
Cassino with a 577,000-euro loss, more than half of what it pays
each year to provide free nursery care. </p>
<p>The documents give the most detailed account of how opaque
derivatives fashioned by securities firms are costing Italian
taxpayers more than $1.2 billion, according to estimates by the
country''s central bank. Firms such as JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank
AG (DBK) sold swaps to governments from Greece to Jefferson County,
Alabama, that offered the promise of cost savings while being
stacked in banks'' favor. Cassino is now cutting nursery-care
funding and has raised charges for garbage collection. </p>
<p>The deal wasn''t likely to make Cassino better off, said
Satyajit Das, author of Extreme Money: The Masters of the
Universe and the Cult of Risk and a former Citigroup Inc. (C)
banker who reviewed details of the swap''s terms. The city took
on a complex cocktail of risks. </p>
<h2>Initial Profit </h2>
<p>The contract generated an initial profit for the bank of
about 800,000 euros, according to a review of transaction
documents by Bloomberg LP''s BVAL derivatives-valuation unit. In
a separate analysis, Cambridge Systems Associates Ltd., a
financial consulting firm based in Cambridge, U.K., estimated
the profit at 690,000 euros. </p>
<p>The reviews were based on documents provided by Cassino as
a record of the final contract with Bear Stearns in compliance
with a ruling by a regional administrative court in Latina,
Italy, that the papers be made available to the public under
freedom of information laws. </p>
<p>The interest rate Cassino paid never dropped below 4.95
percent, even when market rates fell to less than that,
according to the contract. </p>
<p>We lost money, and if there are ways to recover the
losses we will pursue them, said Enzo Salera, Cassino''s
finance director. </p>
<h2>Police Probe </h2>
<p>Cassino stopped payments on the swap in 2008 and sued the
bank as Italy''s financial police began to probe the transaction.
The following year, New York-based JPMorgan paid the city
386,000 euros in compensation, more than three times the town''s
mark-to-market gain on the swap at the time, to end the contract
and the legal fight, the documents show. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase Bank''s involvement with this matter arose
from its subsequent acquisition of Bear Stearns in March 2008,
a spokeswoman for the bank in Milan wrote in an e-mail.
Neither party had made any admission of liability and the
underlying transaction has been terminated as part of the
settlement. Both parties considered the outcome to be mutually
advantageous. </p>
<p>The settlement, details of which the city refused to
disclose for more than two years citing a confidentiality
agreement with the bank, may provide a template for other
municipalities trying to recoup losses from bets on derivatives. </p>
<h2>Bad Practice'' </h2>
<p>The threat that the settlement arrangements by public
entities may one day become public is a deterrent to bad
practice and a further control of how public money is spent,
said Dario Loiacono, a Milan-based securities lawyer who has
represented both banks and municipalities in swaps cases.
However, there is an equally important interest of favoring
settlements by preserving the confidentiality of agreements and
attorney-client privilege. </p>
<p>Cities from Milan to Pforzheim in Germany also are seeking
redress from banks that sold them derivatives that soured. </p>
<p>Bankers from Bear Stearns met with city officials in May
2003, the documents show. A month later, the bank''s Nicola
Bonito Oliva and Alberto Guazzi wrote to Mayor Bruno Scittarelli
detailing the proposed terms of the swap, according to the
documents. The city didn''t seek competing bids from other firms,
papers filed by the municipality show. </p>
<p>The contract agreed to swap Cassino''s fixed-rate payment on
mortgages with Italy''s state-owned lender for a variable rate
tied to the 12-month U.S.-dollar London interbank offered rate,
or Libor (US0012M). </p>
<h2>Extremely Risky'' </h2>
<p>It was an extremely risky deal given that dollar Libor
was at a record low, the police said in testimony to the Italian
Senate in June 2009. Dollar Libor climbed to an almost six-year
high of 5.76 percent in June 2006 from about 1.19 percent at the
time the contract was signed. By the time the city settled,
rates were still higher than when Cassino agreed to the swap. </p>
<p>The town also bet that the cost of borrowing against dollar
rates would be lower than the cost of using euro rates as the
benchmark. In the two years before the deal was signed, dollar
Libor remained consistently lower than Euribor, a trend that
reversed in 2004, when dollar Libor started rising over a flat
Euribor, costing Cassino. Euribor, or the euro interbank offered
rate, is the rate at which European banks say they see each
other lending in euros. </p>
<p>Scittarelli resigned as mayor in July 2010, and the city
was put under direct central government control until a
replacement administration was elected last year. He declined to
comment when reached by telephone, as did Bonito Oliva, the
former Bear Stearns banker who now works at S2R Ltd., a London-
based renewable-energy firm. Guazzi, who now works at Banca del
Ceresio SA, a private bank in Lugano, Switzerland, didn''t return
calls or respond to an e-mail. </p>
<h2>Cassino''s Losses </h2>
<p>Cassino, 80 miles southeast of Rome, gained in the first
year of the swap, according to BVAL and Cambridge Systems. Then,
as interest rates rose, Cassino started to owe the bank money,
beginning with the half-yearly payment due in December 2004. The
payments peaked at more than 500,000 euros in 2006. Over the
life of the swap, the city paid about 960,000 euros to the bank,
BVAL and Cambridge Systems said. </p>
<p>Even when rates fell in June 2008 amid the financial crisis
and Cassino started making money on the derivative, its gains
were limited by a clause that meant its interest rate never
could fall below 4.95 percent. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the mark-to-market loss for Cassino of as much
as 800,000 euros the day the deal was struck would have
translated into a gross profit for the bank. From that, the firm
would have to meet the costs of hedging the transaction and set
aside funds to cover counterparty credit risk, the possibility
that Cassino might default on the agreement. </p>
<p>Bear Stearns also paid a fee to third parties for their
services on the contract, the terms dated Aug. 5, 2003, show.
The documents don''t identify the recipients. </p>
<h2>Swaps Ban </h2>
<p>As the contract drained Cassino''s coffers, town managers
stopped payments in 2008 and sued the bank. Italy''s finance
police estimated in 2009 that Cassino had paid as much as 2
million euros on the swap. An official at the federal auditor
for the Lazio region said he couldn''t comment on the difference
in the estimated losses because the probe is continuing. </p>
<p>Italy banned local governments from signing derivatives in
mid-2008 as lawmakers reviewed existing rules. Concern that many
municipalities misused swaps led legislators to hold a wider
inquiry in 2009 into their use. </p>
<p>The Senate committee proposed barring towns that aren''t
provincial capitals and have fewer than 100,000 residents from
using derivatives. Banks that act as counterparties to swaps
also would be prevented from advising towns on the suitability
of transactions. The legislation is pending. </p>
<h2>Milan, Pforzheim </h2>
<p>In September 2009, when JPMorgan agreed to cancel the deal,
the bet was in Cassino''s favor by about 100,000 euros, BVAL data
show. Cassino had sought 990,000 euros in compensation,
according to the documents. As part of the settlement, the town
dropped its claims in a Milan court for damages, and JPMorgan
agreed to abandon a separate suit at London''s High Court seeking
validation of the contracts. </p>
<p>Other cities also are seeking redress for derivatives.
JPMorgan, UBS AG, Deutsche Bank (DBK) and Depfa Bank Plc (DEP) agreed last
month to unwind interest-rate swaps with the city of Milan''s
government in a 455 million-euro transaction. The banks, on
trial for fraud, agreed to close the swaps at a gain for the
city. In Germany, the city of Pforzheim is seeking compensation
for losses of more than 56 million euros from JPMorgan. </p>
<h2>Greek Swap </h2>
<p>Alabama''s Jefferson County filed for the biggest municipal
bankruptcy in U.S. history in November after it defaulted on
debt backed by sewer revenue. The financial crisis had pushed up
the cost of its bonds, and swaps tied to the securities didn''t
shield it from rising expenses. Greece''s losses on a 2001 swap
with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) almost doubled to 5.1 billion
euros by 2005. The country is now in the process of the biggest
sovereign-debt restructuring in history. </p>
<p>Transparency allows market forces to come in and act,
said Christopher Kit Taylor, a former executive director of
the U.S. Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. Banks would
come in and pitch a better deal if there''s poor pricing -- and
it avoids the Greek problem. Had the Greek swap been known, it
would have stopped other lenders giving it money. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS), after losing $200
million on the sci-fi film John Carter, is mounting a
superhero-style marketing campaign to ensure its next big-budget
movie, Marvel''s The Avengers, is a blockbuster. </p>
<p>The company''s interactive unit designed an online game, the
parks division covered a Florida monorail in ads and the Disney
XD cable network is running an Avengers cartoon, all to help
boost awareness of the film, which opens May 4 to kick off
Hollywood''s summer box-office season. </p>
<p>It''s quite a contrast to another recent Disney effort,
said Jeff Gomez, founder of Starlight Runner Entertainment, an
Internet consultant that works with studios. There are a
number of elements that are unprecedented. </p>
<p>A lot is riding on The Avengers, the first Marvel film
Disney has marketed since buying the comic-book company for $4
billion in 2009. Under Rich Ross, the TV executive who became
studio chairman in October of that year, Disney has cut its
slate in half, betting on fewer films to boost profits. That
plan''s risk was underscored by John Carter, which will drag
the unit to a second-quarter loss of as much as $120 million. </p>
<p>The Avengers may generate domestic ticket sales of $155
million its opening weekend and $370 million in U.S. and
Canadian theaters, estimates Phil Contrino, editor of

<h2>Marketing Effort </h2>
<p>That would be more than five times the domestic tally of
John Carter and a bigger opening than Lions Gate
Entertainment Corp. (LGF)''s The Hunger Games last month, the
third-largest debut of all-time at $152.5 million, according to
Box Office Mojo. </p>
<p>I don''t think there''s any need to worry about this one,
Contrino said in an e-mail. It''s a sure thing. </p>
<p>Disney, based in Burbank, California, rose 0.9 percent
percent to $41.37 at  the close in New York. The shares have
advanced 10 percent this year. </p>
<p>The Avengers, about a team of superheroes battling to
save Earth, stars Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlett Johansson,
reprising their roles as Iron Man and the Black Widow from
2010''s Iron Man 2. That film posted $624 million in
worldwide ticket sales for distributor Paramount Pictures on a
budget of $200 million, according to IMDB. </p>
<p>Disney spent an estimated $220 million producing The
Avengers, $30 million less than on John Carter, according
to the Internet Movie Database, a research website. </p>
<h2>Huge Failure'' </h2>
<p>The company is avoiding mistakes it made with John
Carter, said Peter Sealey, a former Columbia Pictures
executive who is now a consultant. He cited a Carter trailer
that didn''t excite viewers, a change in the studio''s top
marketing officer two months before the release and the removal
of the identifying words of Mars from the title. </p>
<p>It was a huge marketing failure, Sealey said, adding
Disney will get the train back on the track. </p>
<p>Disney has been stoking interest in The Avengers'''' since
at least July 2010, when the stars and director Joss Whedon
appeared at the annual Comic-Con International convention in San
Diego. The film premieres today at the Disney-run El Capitan
theater in Los Angeles, before going into wide release. </p>
<p>The company gave away free screenings in 10 cities where
the most Facebook users signaled they liked the film. More than
1 million did so, according to the site. The trailers have
broken records for downloads on Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s ITunes. </p>
<p>Playdom, acquired by Disney in 2010 and part of the
interactive unit, created its first social game for a Disney
product. Introduced on Facebook Inc. (FB)''s site last month,
Marvel: Avengers Alliance has 640,000 daily users, according
to researcher AppData. </p>
<h2>Avengers'' on Rye </h2>
<p>Disney also lined up an estimated $100 million in
Avengers-related marketing by partners including Hershey
Co. (HSY), hotelier Wyndham Worldwide Corp. (WYN) and Honda Motor Co. (7267)''s
Acura, a record for Marvel, according to the trade publication
Variety. </p>
<p>David Funk, senior vice president of sales and marketing at
Land O''Frost Inc., a Lansing, Illinois-based luncheon meat
maker, began discussing sponsorship packages with Marvel a year
ago. He declined to put a dollar figure on his company''s effort,
which include a sweepstakes for an Avengers-themed trip to
New York, supermarket displays, trading card giveaways and a TV
commercial with a superhero mom making a sandwich. </p>
<p>They told us this was going to be the biggest movie in
their entire portfolio, Funk said in an interview. We
figure: they''re going all out, we''ll go all out too. </p>
<p>Harley-Davidson Inc. (HOG), the largest U.S.-based motorcycle
maker, produced a website where fans can design cartoon
characters and virtual motorcycles. In July, Harley and Marvel
will pick their five favorites, publishing them in online comic
books and giving the winners custom-made Harleys, according to
Dino Bernacchi, director of North American marketing
communications at the Milwaukee-based company. </p>
<p>This is experiential marketing and that''s what we''re
looking to do more of, Bernacchi said in an interview. Who
doesn''t want to be a part of comic history and what cooler way
to do it than riding in on a Harley? </p>

<p>The U.S. economy will probably
expand at a moderate pace this year and next, in part because
fiscal tightening will weigh on growth, according to Vincent Reinhart, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley. </p>
<p>We face headwinds, Reinhart said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television''s Surveillance Midday with Tom Keene.
The world is a risky place between the sovereign debt crisis
in Europe, potentially rising energy prices and that fiscal
cliff which is an unstoppable force. </p>
<p>Reinhart predicted in an April 2 report that the U.S.
economy will expand 2 percent this year and next. Bush-era tax
cuts are set to expire at the end of the year, and a deficit
reduction law requiring $1 trillion of cutbacks also kicks in if
lawmakers can''t agree on a new plan. </p>
<p>We have legislated a sudden stop in our fiscal posture,
Reinhart said. That may subtract about 5 percentage points from
growth next year, he said. When you do that sort of sudden
stop, you do not help economic activity and you worsen the
deficit. </p>
<p>U.S. stocks halted the longest slump of the year as Alcoa
Inc. (AA) opened the earnings season with an unexpected profit. The
Standard  Poor''s 500 Index advanced 0.8 percent to 1,369.37 at
11:51 a.m. in New York, ending a five-day decline. Treasuries
weakened for the first time in six days. </p>
<p>The potential drag from fiscal restraint contributed to the
rationale behind Federal Reserve policy makers cutting their
growth forecasts for this year and 2013 at their January
meeting, according to the minutes of the gathering. At the same
meeting, they also decided to extend their plan to keep interest
rates near zero through at least late 2014 instead of mid-2013. </p>
<h2>Record Stimulus </h2>
<p>If Fed officials see the need to add to their record
monetary stimulus, they will probably first turn to
communications tools to reassure investors that the intent is
to keep the policy rate low for a very long time, Reinhart
said. If they need to after that, they can resort to
quantitative easing. </p>
<p>The Fed has kept its benchmark rate near zero since
December 2008 and purchased $2.3 trillion of bonds in two rounds
of so-called quantitative easing. The central bank is now
pursuing a maturity-extension program announced in September to
replace $400 billion of short-term debt with longer-term
securities. The so-called Operation Twist is scheduled to be
completed in June. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) is taking on Oracle Corp. (ORCL) and Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) with
server computers and software packaged and automated to reduce
the time and money clients spend on scut work. </p>
<p>The world''s largest computer-services provider built what
it calls PureSystems over four years, delivering server systems
that are easier to install, automate, update and manage, IBM
said in a statement. That frees information-technology staff to
work on more valuable, business-specific tasks, it said. </p>
<p>IBM is positioning PureSystems as an offering that
simplifies technology building blocks to compete with Oracle''s
Exadata and Cisco''s UCS and VCE products. The system may also
help IBM fend off competition to its hardware and software sales
from Web-based cloud-computing services by providers such as
Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), said John Rymer, a Forrester Research analyst. </p>
<p>They''re being challenged now by folks coming out with
cloud environments, Rymer, who did research work related to
the project for IBM last year, said in a phone interview. This
product line is a very significant attempt by IBM to provide a
competitive option to some of those cloud environments,
something that can be installed on premise. </p>
<p>Software and hardware together made up more than 40 percent
of Armonk, New York-based IBM''s revenue of $107 billion last
year, with services accounting for almost all of the rest. </p>
<h2>Cloud Threat </h2>
<p>IBM estimates companies use more than 70 percent of their
IT budgets managing and maintaining existing infrastructure,
said Steve Mills, IBM''s senior vice president and group
executive overseeing software and systems. To help reduce costs,
IBM is offering standardized configurations and pre-installed
application patterns that companies can build upon more
quickly than constructing their systems from scratch, he said. </p>
<p>We have this ability to mass-customize, to lower the cost
of computing, Mills said in a phone interview. Clients are
spending way too much money just trying to get things to work
properly. </p>
<p>IBM identified the problem more than a decade ago when the
cost of getting server systems up and running surpassed the cost
of the hardware, Mills said. </p>
<p>Corporations want IT employees to spend more time
developing business services and less time on all the scut work,
the basic manual labor of getting stuff configured right,
getting it installed correctly, scaling it, raising the
capacity, Rymer said. </p>
<p>An in-house option that needs less tech support from the
start may also be competitive against cloud services, Rymer
said. Corporations are migrating to cloud providers such as
Amazon''s Web Services, as they seek to run and store
applications in outside data centers instead of buying and
maintaining the servers and other hardware themselves. Forrester
has estimated that the market for cloud-computing services will
reach $61 billion by the end of this year. </p>
<p>IBM fell 1.3 percent to $202.33 yesterday. The stock has
advanced 10 percent this year, and on March 5 closed above $200
for the first time, factoring in stock splits. </p>

<p> Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)''s costs for
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson''s personal
use of company-owned aircraft increased sixfold in 2011,
according to a U.S. regulatory filing. </p>
<p>Tillerson''s personal use of company planes cost $197,323
last year, compared with $29,409 in 2010, Irving, Texas-based
Exxon said today in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
filing. The expense was included in executive compensation
disclosures that showed Tillerson''s total compensation rose 17
percent to $34.9 million in 2011, including stock awards and
deferred compensation. </p>
<p>The increase in costs associated with Tillerson''s personal
use of company planes stemmed in part from escalating fuel prices
and maintenance expenses, as well as more trips, Alan Jeffers,
an Exxon spokesman, said today in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>For security reasons, the board requires the chairman and
CEO to use company aircraft for both personal and business
travel, Exxon said in the filing. The board considers these
costs to be necessary, security-related expenses rather than
perquisites, but per the disclosure regulations we report the
incremental cost of aircraft usage for personal travel. </p>
<p>Exxon rose 16 percent in New York last year as civil
conflicts in North Africa and the Middle East helped push Brent
crude prices to a full-year average above $110 a barrel. Profit
for 2011 jumped 35 percent to $41.1 billion. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will pay
$22 million to resolve U.S. regulators'' claims that the firm
failed to implement policies to keep its stock analysts from
tipping select clients about upcoming research changes. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs held weekly huddles from 2006 to 2011 in
which analysts discussed short-term trading ideas and traders
shared their views of the markets, the Securities and Exchange
Commission said in a statement today. The meetings created a
serious risk that employees and clients could trade on the
non-public information, the SEC said. </p>
<p>Higher-risk trading and business strategies require
higher-order controls, SEC Enforcement Director Robert Khuzami
said in the agency''s statement. Despite being on notice from
the SEC about the importance of such controls, Goldman failed to
implement policies and procedures that adequately controlled the
risk that research analysts could preview upcoming ratings
changes with select traders and clients. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs paid a $10 million fine last year to resolve
similar claims from state regulators in Massachusetts and was
among 10 securities firms that paid disgorgement and civil
penalties totaling $1.4 billion to settle claims related to a
probe of analysts'' conflicts of interest in 2003. </p>
<p>We are pleased to have resolved this matter, Goldman
Sachs spokesman Michael DuVally said today in an e-mail. </p>
<p>Under the settlement, Goldman Sachs will pay about $11
million to the SEC and the same amount to the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority, the Washington-based brokerage industry
regulator. </p>
<h2>New Legislation </h2>
<p>Analyst conflicts of interest garnered attention this month
after President Barack Obama signed legislation that critics
said will undo some rules emanating from the 2003 settlement.
Under the law, regulators are no longer able to write or
maintain rules that restrict investment bankers from arranging
communications between analysts and investors when dealing with
firms with less than $1 billion in gross annual revenue. </p>
<p>In 2007, Goldman Sachs launched the Asymmetric Service
Initiative, a program in which research analysts called a select
group of about 180 hedge-fund and investment-management clients
to share information and trading ideas from the huddles, the SEC
said. The huddles and the program were an extensive
undertaking to improve the performance of the firm''s traders
and boost commissions from clients, according to the agency. </p>
<p>Research analysts'' contributions to the huddles were
considered in their performance evaluations and could impact
their compensation, the SEC said. </p>
<h2>Generate Profits </h2>
<p>In an administrative order filed today, the SEC cited an e-
mail from a Goldman Sachs manager that said employees had a
responsibility to generate trading ideas for huddles based on
your view of the stocks that will move short term and generate
profits for the trading desk. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs traders who participated in the huddles were
primarily those who dealt directly with customers, including
market-making and client-facilitation traders from its
securities division, the SEC said. Until 2009, members of
Goldman Sachs''s Franchise Risk Management Group, who were
authorized to establish large, long-term positions on behalf of
the firm, also attended the huddles, according to the order. </p>
<p>The huddle program created a serious and substantial
risk that analysts would share material, non-public
information about their research with clients, many of whom were
frequent, high-volume traders, the SEC said. Goldman Sachs
failed to establish and enforce policies and procedures to
prevent misuse of the information, according to the agency. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) seeks to hire five
more people for its over-the-counter derivative clearing
operations in Japan in a bid to boost fee income and lure new
clients ahead of tougher regulations. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley plans to have the positions filled within a
year to help target Japanese banks, government affiliated
financial institutions, insurers, asset managers, hedge funds
and other clients, said Kimihiko Matsuno, who heads the New
York-based bank''s Asia OTC client clearing business in Tokyo. </p>
<p>Financial institutions trading interest-rate and credit-default swaps over the counter are preparing to process
transactions through a central counterparty after world leaders
agreed to tighten rules following the global financial crisis.
Morgan Stanley rival Citigroup Inc. (C) in February appointed Hiro Matsuki to market its listed and OTC derivatives clearing
business in Japan. </p>
<p>The importance of OTC clearing will continue to grow as
the market and regulators seek transparency and reduced risk,
Matsuno said in an interview. New businesses such as OTC
client clearing will add strength and diversity to the
traditional broker-dealer businesses both in Japan and
globally. </p>
<h2>OTC Market </h2>
<p>The outstanding balance of yen denominated interest-rate
swaps was $21.8 trillion as of December 2011, according to the
Bank of Japan, up from $20 trillion a year earlier and $15.8
trillion in 2009. The one-month average daily trading volume of
the yen interest-rate swap market in Japan was $82.3 billion as
of April 2010, according to the central bank. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) reported a 3.1
percent drop in earnings, a smaller decline than analysts
estimated as mortgage revenue surged and trading almost doubled
from the fourth quarter. </p>
<p>First-quarter net income fell to $5.38 billion, or $1.31 a
share, from a record $5.56 billion, or $1.28, in the same period
a year earlier when there were more shares outstanding, the New

compared with an average estimate of $1.17 from 28 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56,
benefited from gains in mortgage lending as low interest rates
and federal incentive programs encouraged homeowners to
refinance. Mortgage fees and related revenue totaled $2 billion,
compared with negative revenue of $489 million a year earlier.
U.S. lenders made $318 billion in residential mortgages during
the first quarter, including $242 billion in refinanced loans,
according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. </p>
<p>This is going to be a strong quarter for anyone who has a
big mortgage lending or trading business, said Paul Miller, an

said expanded federal programs to aid in refinancings have given
the market a boost. It might be the best quarter in a long

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Wells
Fargo  Co. (WFC), the two most profitable U.S. banks last year,
reported first-quarter earnings that topped analysts'' estimates
on a surge in mortgage fees. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s earnings per share climbed to $1.31 from $1.28 a
year earlier, while Wells Fargo posted net income of 75 cents
per share, up from 67 cents. Those results beat analysts''
estimates of $1.17 and 73 cents per share, respectively. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo had its highest mortgage banking fees since
2009 and JPMorgan set a record for home-loan production income
amid gains from the government''s Home Affordable Refinance
Program and interest rates that fell to a record low. Both banks
benefited from the lowest net charge-offs since the financial
crisis as delinquencies fell. </p>
<p>Mortgage has been pretty strong over the last quarter or
so, David George, a bank analyst at Robert W. Baird  Co.,

<p>Still, both banks faced higher charges related to mortgage
lawsuits and repurchase claims. JPMorgan set aside $2.5 billion
more toward its litigation costs during the first quarter mostly
for mortgage-related disputes. Wells Fargo set aside $430
million to cover mortgage repurchase claims, an increase over
the $404 million in the fourth quarter. </p>
<h2>Fixed Income </h2>
<p>Revenue at Wells Fargo climbed 6.4 percent to $21.6
billion, more than the $20.4 billion forecast by analysts.
JPMorgan''s revenue rose 6 percent to $26.7 billion from $25.2
billion during the first quarter of last year. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo''s costs also advanced, with non-interest
expenses climbing about 2 percent to $13 billion amid higher
compensation and legal spending. </p>
<p>The bank said quarterly costs will fall to $11.25 billion
by the end of the year, the high end of Chief Executive Officer
John Stumpf''s stated goal for reducing expenses to between
$10.75 billion and $11.25 billion. Costs will fall by as much as
$700 million in the second quarter, the company said. </p>
<p>Retail banking at JPMorgan, which includes home loans and
checking accounts, earned $1.75 billion, up from $533 million in
the fourth quarter and a loss of $399 million a year earlier.
The net interest margin, which measures the profit margin on
lending, declined to 2.61 percent from 2.89 percent a year
earlier. </p>
<h2>Mortgage Business </h2>
<p>Demand for loans rose as the unemployment rate fell to 8.2
percent at the end of March from 8.9 percent a year ago.
Mortgage originations likely climbed 5.3 percent to $318 billion
in the first quarter from the same quarter last year,
driven by strong refinance activity, according to the Mortgage
Bankers Association. </p>
<p>Revenue at JPMorgan''s investment-banking unit didn''t match
last year''s near-record $8.23 billion, falling 11 percent to
$7.32 billion. It gained 68 percent from the fourth quarter as
financial markets in Europe stabilized. Revenue from fixed-
income and equity trading, almost doubled from the fourth
quarter and beat estimates from analysts including Atlantic
Equities'' Richard Staite. </p>
<p>In the investment bank, you saw very strong flows in the
underlying customer businesses in both fixed-income and equity
markets, Chief Financial Officer Doug Braunstein said. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has transformed the bank''s chief
investment office in the past five years, increasing the size
and risk of its speculative bets, according to five former
executives with direct knowledge of the changes. </p>
<p>Achilles Macris, hired in 2006 as the CIO''s top executive
in London, led an expansion into corporate and mortgage-debt
investments with a mandate to generate profits for the New York-
based bank, three of the former employees said. Dimon, 56,
closely supervised the shift from the CIO''s previous focus on
protecting JPMorgan from risks inherent in its banking business,
such as interest-rate and currency movements, they said. </p>
<p>Some of Macris''s bets are now so large that JPMorgan
probably can''t unwind them without losing money or roiling
financial markets, the former executives said, based on
knowledge gleaned from people inside the bank and dealers at
other firms. Bruno Iksil, a London-based trader in Macris''s
group, gained attention last week after moving markets with his
trades, drawing a comparison to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke''s power in the government-bond market. </p>
<p>What Bernanke is to the Treasury market, Iksil is to the
derivatives market, Bonnie Baha, head of the global developed
credit group at DoubleLine Capital LP in Los Angeles, where she
helps oversee $32 billion, said in a telephone interview. </p>

<p>Strategists at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
lowered their recommendation on U.S. investment-grade corporate
bonds to neutral from overweight, saying that uncertainty about
Europe''s fiscal crisis will limit returns for the debt. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s Eric Beinstein, head of the New York-based
bank''s top-rated high-grade strategy team, said in a report
today that the extra yield the bonds pay more than similar-
maturity Treasuries is unlikely to tighten much in the next few
months as the European situation weighs on investor demand.
Beinstein still expects spreads to drop to 175 basis points by
the end of the year, from about 200, he said. </p>
<p>We believe renewed uncertainty in peripheral Europe will
limit the ability of spreads to tighten meaningfully over the
next couple of months, Beinstein wrote in the report. That
will counter expected positive developments in the Chinese and
U.S. economies, he wrote. </p>
<p>Investors have been scooping up corporate bonds this year
on optimism that borrowers will have an easier time meeting
their debt payments amid signs the global economy is recovering.
The extra yield, or spread, over Treasuries that investors
demand to hold highly-rated U.S. corporate bonds fell to 201
basis points yesterday from 257 basis points at the end of last
year, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. </p>
<p>Beinstein''s team ranked No. 1 for investment-grade
strategists in Institutional Investor magazine''s annual poll. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank by assets, is very conservative in investing the

<p>We create deposits around the world, and we''re very
conservative, Dimon said today in a conference call with
reporters after the New York-based firm reported first-quarter
earnings. The portfolio does change over time as we change our
views. </p>
<p>Bruno Iksil, a London-based trader in JPMorgan''s chief
investment office, built positions in contracts linked to the
value of corporate debt that market participants said were so
big that they moved the market. JPMorgan''s chief investment
office has been transformed in recent years by Dimon into a unit
that makes bigger and riskier speculative bets with the bank''s
money, five former employees said this week. </p>
<p>Holdings in the chief investment office include about $70
billion of European mortgage-linked debt, said Dimon, 56. The
bank''s regulators can see everything the company does whenever
they want, he said. </p>
<p>The firm has more money from deposits than it has extended
in loans and it invests the difference, about $360 billion, in
a variety of very high-grade securities, Chief Financial
Officer Douglas Braunstein said. </p>

<p>     April 16 (Bloomberg) --Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and MetLife
Inc. (MET) agreed to disclose information about the race and gender of
their workforces at the request of New York City''s pension
funds. </p>
<p>Goldman will release the demographics in a June report,
while MetLife will publish the data on its website, Comptroller
John C. Liu said in a statement. He called on other New York-
based companies, including American International Group Inc. (AIG) and
Omnicom Group Inc. (OMC), to make such information available. </p>
<p>The requests are part of an effort by Liu and the city
pension funds to expand opportunities for women and minorities
to obtain management-level jobs in financial services and
advertising. </p>
<p>Many companies say they are making serious efforts to
recruit, retain and promote women and minorities, Liu said.
Without quantitative disclosure, shareowners have no way to
evaluate the effectiveness of these efforts. </p>
<p>As comptroller, Liu serves as investment adviser and
trustee of five New York City pension funds valued at $115
billion as of Dec. 31. Combined, the funds hold more than 1.2
million Goldman shares, 2.3 million MetLife shares, 708,906
Omnicom shares and 1.1 million AIG shares, according to Liu''s
statement. </p>
<p>The number of women and minorities holding management-level
jobs in finance didn''t substantially increase from 1993-2008,
according to Liu''s statement. </p>
<p>In 2008, white men held 64 percent of management positions
in the financial industry, while women held 27 percent,
according to the statement. Together, women and minorities held
less than 10 percent of executive positions at financial firms. </p>
<p>A diverse and inclusive work force has been an ongoing
focus for MetLife, and we have made steady progress over the
years, said Frans Hijkoop, MetLife executive vice president,
human resources, said in the Liu statement. At the same time,
we are continuing to make additional strides to promote
diversity. </p>
<p>The agreement on disclosing diversity data was reported
earlier today by the New York Times. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s private
equity funds are selling a stake in Industrial  Commercial Bank
of China (601398) Ltd. to Temasek Holdings Pte (TMSK) in their largest
divestment of stock in the world''s biggest bank by market value. </p>
<p>Funds affiliated with Goldman Sachs are selling $2.5
billion of shares at HK$5.05 each, according to a term sheet.
Temasek, the Singapore state-owned investment group that is
increasing stakes in China''s biggest banks, said it was buying
3.55 billion shares, or 4 percent of ICBC''s Hong Kong-traded
shares. The holding would cost $2.3 billion, based on the per-
share price and stake size. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Bank of
America Corp. were among foreign banks that spent a combined $22
billion between 2004 and 2006 to purchase stakes in Chinese
lenders ahead of their initial public offerings. Goldman Sachs,
which owns ICBC stock directly and through private equity funds
managed by the firm, has generated $3 billion in gains on ICBC
since the fourth quarter of 2006, according to company filings. </p>
<p>The ICBC stocks have done well for them, Sandy Mehta,
chief executive officer at Hong Kong-based Value Investment
Principals Ltd., said by telephone today. You''ll continue to
see sales of Chinese bank stocks by these banks. It''s a
continuation of the trend. It''s been happening now for a year. </p>
<p>Shares of ICBC have rallied more than 40 percent since
hitting a 2 1/2-year low in October as concern eased that
Europe''s debt crisis would lead to a further economic slowdown
in China. The MSCI China/Financials Index, which includes ICBC,
has tripled in value in the past eight years. </p>
<p>The price of Goldman Sachs'' stake is a 3.1 percent discount
from the HK$5.21 close of ICBC shares on April 13. The stock
fell 9 percent from its Feb. 29 peak this year. </p>
<h2>Shares Fall </h2>
<p>ICBC shares dropped 0.8 percent to HK$5.17 at the close of
trading in Hong Kong, the first decline in three days. The stock
trades at 6.4 times estimated earnings, down from a multiple of
9.9 a year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The sale is the fourth and biggest by value for New York-
based Goldman Sachs. The U.S. securities firm raised $1.1
billion in November selling shares in ICBC at HK$4.88 each. </p>
<p>The deal represents about 40 percent of Goldman Sachs'' 8.78
billion shares of ICBC as of Dec. 31, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. As of Dec. 31, Goldman Sachs owned $4.71 billion
of ICBC stock on its own balance sheet, down from $7.59 billion
a year earlier, according to the New York-based company''s annual
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs and funds affiliated with Goldman Sachs
remain ICBC''s second-biggest holder of H shares, based on the
shareholding data of the Chinese lender''s Hong Kong-traded
stock. </p>
<h2>Healthy Profit'' </h2>
<p>The company''s stake in Beijing-based ICBC generated a $517
million pretax loss in 2011 compared with a $747 million gain a
year earlier, the firm disclosed on Jan. 18. Goldman Sachs,
which acquired its ICBC stock in 2006, doesn''t report other
individual stock investments in Asia in its annual filing. </p>
<p>Investment banks need a healthy profit, said Mehta. I
don''t think Goldman needs the capital as much as others. It''s
certainly not urgent to have a distressed sale on the part of
Goldman, but it just reflects they need a healthy profit from
this transaction. </p>
<p>Temasek has been increasing holdings in China Construction
Bank Corp. (939) and Bank of China Ltd. (3988) as global lenders divest. It
bought 3.77 billion shares of China Construction Bank from Bank
of America on Nov. 11, increasing its stake in the second-
largest Chinese lender by value, and raised its investment in
Bank of China, the nation''s fourth biggest, to 7.07 percent from
6.96 percent after buying 97.1 million shares in August. </p>
<h2>The Lifeline'' </h2>
<p>Temasek''s underlying strategy is investing in growth
areas like China and key sectors like banks and this is
essentially an opportunity that came up, said Song Seng Wun, a
regional economist at CIMB Research Pte in Singapore. Asia is
likely to lead the growth in the near-to-middle term, so all
these deals are essentially to anchor that, and banks are
basically the lifeline and heart of any economy. </p>
<p>The Singapore investment fund, which managed S$193 billion
($154 billion) as of March 2011, said in a statement today that
the purchase will give it a deemed interest of 5.3 percent in
the Hong Kong-listed shares of ICBC, which includes stakes held
by its units and associates. </p>
<p>ICBC widened its lead as the world''s most profitable lender
last month after reporting a 17 percent increase in fourth-
quarter net income. The percentage of financial services
companies in Temasek''s holdings rose to 36 percent from 35
percent as of March 2011. </p>
<p>Citigroup Inc. (C) last month sold its entire stake in Shanghai
Pudong Development Bank Co. nine years after the purchase for an
after-tax gain of $349 million. Bank of America sold 10.4
billion shares of China Construction Bank in November for a
profit of about $1.8 billion, leaving it with a 1 percent stake. </p>
<h2>Strategic Investments </h2>
<p>The overseas firms touted the strategic nature of their
investments and pledged to work with their Chinese counterparts
on everything from risk management to information systems. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs will continue to reduce its stake in ICBC
because of the capital required to be held against the
investment, said Michael Werner, a senior banks analyst at
Sanford C Bernstein  Co. in Hong Kong. </p>
<p>The bank purchased its stake in ICBC when it was a
broker-dealer, said Werner. Now that it is a bank holding
company, which means higher capital requirements and subject to
the Dodd-Frank rule, it is much less attractive to hold its
stake in ICBC. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs converted to a bank holding company and
accepted $10 billion in government rescue funds in 2008. The
Dodd-Frank Act subjects the largest banks to higher capital
requirements. </p>

<h2>Daniel Boulud''s Restaurant Group Sues Buffalo Bar </h2>
<p>A restaurant company affiliated with celebrity chef Daniel
Boulud sued a Buffalo, New York bar for trademark infringement. </p>
<p>Boulud''s Manhattan-based Dinex Group LLC accused the
operators of Duke''s Bohemian Grove Bar of infringing the
DBGB trademark it used with restaurant and bar services.
According to the complaint filed April 10 in Manhattan, Dinex
has used the mark continuously since June 2009. </p>
<p>One of the Dinex properties in New York is the DBGB Kitchen
 Bar. Among the others are Daniel and Caf Boulud. Boulud was
awarded three Michelin stars and the James Beard Award for an
outstanding restaurant for Daniel. </p>
<p>Dinex said it contacted the Buffalo bar''s owners in August
2010 and asked them to quit using the DBGB designation.
According to the complaint, counsel for Buffalo group said in
September 2010 that it would quit using DBGB'' on its signs and
advertising. </p>
<p>The suit was filed because Dinex became aware'''' that the
Buffalo group was still using the DBGB designation. </p>
<p>The owners of the Buffalo property didn''t immediately
respond to an e-mailed seeking comment on the complaint. </p>
<p>Dinex asked the court to order the defendants to halt their
alleged infringement and for an order for the seizure and
destruction of all offending promotional materials.
Additionally, the company seeks awards of the Buffalo group''s
profits flowing from the alleged infringement, money damages,
attorney fees and litigation costs. </p>
<p>The restaurant company asked that the damages be tripled
and that additional damages be levied to punish the defendants
for their actions. </p>
<p>The case is Dinex Group LLC v. Pat Duquin, 1:12-cv-02767-

<p>Sekara told the Smoking Gun gossip website that while he
has no affiliation with George Zimmerman, that he''d share some
of the revenue from the sale of the trademark items with
Zimmerman. </p>
<p>George Zimmerman is the Florida resident who was charged
with second-degree murder April 11 in connection with the
shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. He shot Martin on Feb.
26 in Sanford, a central-Florida town of 54,000 people north of
Orlando. </p>
<p>Florida''s Stand Your Ground law enables individuals who
feel threatened in a public place to meet force with force,
rather than back away, a statute that strengthens any
traditional self-defense assertion, criminal attorneys said. </p>
<p>The law prevented police from arresting Zimmerman in
February, officials said at the time, and may play a role in
derailing the prosecution, according to Florida defense lawyers,
who said the defendant may be able to raise the issue both
before, and during, any trial. </p>
<p>According to the Smoking Gun website, Sekara said he
thought that the public jumped to too many conclusions about
the shooting. He has also registered a domain name,
Ibelieveyouzimmerman.com that hasn''t gone live. </p>

<h2>Megaupload Data Ruling Deferred by Judge for Further Talks </h2>
<p>A U.S. judge deferred a decision on whether millions of
gigabytes of data belonging to users of Megaupload.com should be
preserved or the data-storage company that owns the servers
where it''s housed can delete it. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Liam O''Grady, at a hearing April 13 in
Alexandria, Virginia, told federal prosecutors they have two
weeks to work out an agreement with parties claiming an interest
in the massive cache of data that became inaccessible when law
enforcement agents shut down Megaupload in January. </p>
<p>The parties include attorneys for the Motion Picture
Association of America, who said the files contain the largest
collection of copyright-infringed material in the world, as well
as attorneys for Megaupload, who argue they need the data to
defend the company''s directors against charges including
criminal copyright infringement. </p>
<p>Prosecutors this month said in court papers they already
had a large sampling of the data cache and will provide it to
defense attorneys. They contend the data need not be preserved
for purposes related to the criminal prosecution. </p>
<p>Julie Samuels, an attorney for the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, an Internet civil liberties group, argued that the
government should establish a system through which those users
could file affidavits and claim their data. </p>
<p>Such a system would be difficult. The more than 1,000
servers on which the data had been stored have been unplugged
and shipped to a warehouse in Virginia, according to Marc Zwillinger, an attorney for Carpathia Hosting Inc., the Dulles,
Virginia-based hosting company that Megaupload paid to store its
users'' data. </p>
<p>Carpathia was paid $35 million over several years by
Megaupload, prosecutors said. Zwillinger said Carpathia simply
provided a platform to its client, and should no longer be
required to pay for the data''s upkeep. </p>
<p>Carpathia agreed to sell the servers to Megaupload for $1.2
million, a cost the company was willing to incur as part of the
defense of Dotcom and other company directors, Zwillinger said. </p>
<p>Jay Prabhu, the chief of the cybercrime unit in the U.S.
attorney''s office in Alexandria, told O''Grady that the MPAA
objects to returning the copyright-infringed material to a
company that helped illegally disseminate it. </p>
<p>Investigators in January executed more than 20 search
warrants in the U.S. and eight other countries and seized about
$50 million in assets associated with Megaupload.com. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Dotcom, 1:12-00003, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of Virginia (Alexandria). </p>

<h2>Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage </h2>
<h2>Ocean Tomo, Former Official Settle Trade Secret Dispute </h2>
<p>The trade secrets case that Ocean Tomo LLC, a self-
described intellectual property merchant bank, filed against the
former president of its PatentRatings unit has settled,
according to an April 10 court filing. </p>
<p>The suit, filed in federal court in Los Angeles Jan. 27,
accused Steve Lee of downloading Ocean Tomo data from a company
laptop and saying he would disclose this information to Jonathan
Barney and Barney''s company. </p>
<p>Lee was president of PatentRatings until his resignation in
September. Before he came to Ocean Tomo, Lee was a management
consultant for the Boston Consulting Group, and before that, a
design engineer at Hughes Aircraft Co. </p>
<p>Barney, a patent lawyer who was the inventor of the Patent
Ratings system, left Ocean Tomo in February 2011, following a
dispute over the company''s expansion plans, according to a
posting on the Intellectual Asset Management magazine blog. </p>
<p>Barney is the holder of patent 6,556,992, which covers the
patent-rating system that he had licensed to Ocean Tomo. He was
sued by Ocean Tomo in Illinois state court Jan. 27, accusing him
of breach of contract, and destruction of the company''s
confidential information. </p>
<p>According to an April 3 court order, Lee is barred from
disclosing Ocean Tomo trade secrets. This includes attorney-
client communications and attorney work-product of Ocean Tomo
related to a dispute with Patent Ratings that is presently in
proceedings before the American Arbitration Association. </p>
<p>The court excluded from its order information that Lee had
that he could demonstrate was known to him from sources other
than Ocean Tomo, that he developed independently without
violating his employment agreement, or that he could demonstrate
is generally known to technology or intellectual property
professionals. </p>
<p>The case against Lee is Ocean Tomo LLC v. Steve Lee, 8:12-
cv-00146-JVS-MLG, U.S. District Court, Central District of
California (Santa Ana). </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world''s biggest computer-services provider, raised
its full-year earnings forecast after posting a 7.1 percent
increase in first-quarter profit, helped by software margins. </p>
<p>Operating earnings will increase to at least $15 a share
this year, IBM said today, boosting its January forecast of at
least $14.85. Analysts predicted $14.92, the average of
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company also reported
revenue for last quarter that fell short of projections. </p>
<p>IBM is making progress with a plan to make software, which
is more profitable than hardware, account for half of earnings
as businesses and governments boost spending on programs that
analyze data and project trends. Consulting was hurt by Japan''s
recovery from last year''s earthquake and tsunami, as well as
constrained government budgets all over the world, Chief
Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said today. </p>
<p>The major markets continued to be weighed down by Japan
and by the public sector, which declined more sharply this
quarter in terms of business services demand, Loughridge said
on a conference call. The growth markets continued to perform
well, with double-digit growth again this quarter. </p>
<p>Loughridge reiterated that he expects the company''s
performance to improve in the second half. </p>
<h2>Bottom Line'' </h2>
<p>The top line and likely the bottom line should be
stronger in the second half, Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at
Sanford C. Bernstein  Co., said in a phone interview after the
earnings release. The comparisons get a lot easier and they
are going to have some benefits from the cost cutting, said
Sacconaghi, who has a market perform rating on the stock. </p>
<p>IBM fell 2.4 percent to $202.56 in extended trading, after
rising 2.3 percent to $207.45 at the close. Last month, the
Armonk, New York-based company''s shares closed above $200 for
the first time, factoring in stock splits. </p>
<p>Sales increased 0.3 percent to $24.7 billion, compared with
the $24.8 billion analysts predicted. Net income advanced to
$3.07 billion, or $2.61 a share, from $2.86 billion, or $2.31, a
year earlier. Earnings excluding some items rose to $2.78 a
share from $2.41. Analysts predicted $2.65. </p>
<p>Revenue from Europe, Middle East and Africa declined 2
percent to $7.6 billion, while sales in the Americas and Asia-
Pacific region increased. </p>
<p>The effect on IBM''s revenue growth from Europe''s debt
crisis may worry some investors, said Joseph Foresi, an analyst
at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Boston, who has a buy rating
on the company. </p>
<h2>Growth Markets </h2>
<p>The euro averaged $1.31 in the first quarter, down 4.2
percent from the year-earlier period as Europe''s financial woes
continued. The drop means revenue from Europe, which combined
with Middle East and Africa accounts for about a third of IBM''s
sales, is worth less when converted to dollars. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Virginia Ginni Rometty, who
took over in January, is also seeking to expand in faster-
growing economies. Revenue from growth markets, such as Brazil,
India and China, increased 9 percent in the first quarter. Sales
from the regions will make up at least 30 percent of revenue by
2015, the company has said, up from 22 percent in 2011. </p>
<p>Formerly IBM''s sales and marketing head, Rometty, 54,
succeeded Sam Palmisano and became the first female CEO in the
company''s 100-year history. Palmisano, who had been CEO since
2002, remains chairman. </p>
<h2>Hardware Sales </h2>
<p>Rometty inherited a five-year plan that targets annual
operating earnings of at least $20 a share by 2015, up from
$13.44 last year. IBM is tapping a gusher of data through
its Smarter Planet and Smarter Commerce initiatives to achieve
its 2015 growth targets, Rometty said in her first letter to
shareholders in the 2011 annual report. </p>
<p>Sales at IBM''s software unit rose 5.5 percent to $5.6
billion. Services revenue growth slowed to 0.7 percent from the
fourth quarter''s 3 percent, while hardware sales declined 6.7
percent. </p>
<p>Backlog, which measures expected future revenue from
contracts, totaled $139 billion in the quarter, down $2 billion
from the fourth quarter. Contract signings for services were
$11.8 billion. Mark Moskowitz, an analyst at JPMorgan  Chase
Co., projected $11.1 billion. </p>
<p>IBM has set goals of adding $20 billion in new revenue and
spending about $20 billion on acquisitions, from 2010 through
2015, as it expands offerings to business customers. </p>
<p>Loughridge today reiterated that acquisition goal on a
conference call, and said IBM spent $1.3 billion in the first
quarter closing purchases of five companies, including DemandTec
Inc. </p>
<p>IBM is selling its point-of-sale terminal business for
about $850 million to Toshiba Tec Corp. (6588), the Japanese maker of
scanners and bar-code machines, the companies said earlier
today. That deal is a partnership that will allow IBM and
Toshiba to combine some offerings in commerce, Loughridge said. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) won a court order
directing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to reconsider
its denial of a bid to charge market rates on oil carried
through the Pegasus pipeline. </p>
<p>The agency''s decision to reject the request was
unreasonable because the Illinois-to-Texas pipeline doesn''t
have the ability to control the market for transporting Canadian
crude, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled today. The 858-mile
(1,381-kilometer) system handles 3 percent of the 2.2 million
barrels Western Canada produces daily, the court said. </p>
<p>The record shows that producers and shippers of Western
Canadian crude oil have numerous competitive alternatives to
Pegasus for transporting and selling their crude oil, the
three-judge panel said, returning the issue to the agency for
reconsideration. </p>
<p>Mobil Pipeline, a unit of Irving, Texas-based Exxon Mobil,
asked FERC for permission to charges uncapped rates in 2007. The
decision may affect other pipeline operators that have announced
plans to ship Canadian crude to the U.S. Enbridge Inc. (ENB) and
Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD) have requested the same type of
rate structure for their Seaway system. </p>
<p>Exxon is pleased with the decision, Patrick Henretty, a
spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. He declined to comment
on the case''s impact on other pipelines. The Pegasus line
carries about 66,000 barrels of oil a day, according to the
court. </p>
<h2>Refined Products </h2>
<p>Tamara Young-Allen, a spokeswoman for the commission,
declined to comment on the ruling. The agency hasn''t allowed
market-based rates on oil pipelines, although it has allowed
them on lines that ship refined products such as gasoline, she
said. </p>
<p>Unlike standard rates, pipelines with market-based rates
can charge whatever the market will bear and change their rates
without prior approval from the commission. </p>
<p>Oil producers challenged Pegasus'' request, saying it would
give the pipeline operator too much control over transportation
prices. </p>
<p>The agency denied Exxon''s request after concluding it had
the ability to manipulate rates on Pegasus above competitive
levels for a significant period of time because of the lack of
competition, the court said. </p>
<p>The commission jumped the rails by treating the Pegasus
pipeline as the rough equivalent of a bottleneck or essential
facility for transportation of Western Canadian crude, Circuit
Judge Brett Kavanaugh wrote for the court. The record
thoroughly undermines FERC''s conclusion. </p>
<h2>Other Rate Seekers </h2>
<p>In the five years since Pegasus applied for the rate, two
other pipelines have been announced that would carry Canadian
crude to refiners on the U.S. Gulf Coast. </p>
<p>TransCanada Corp. (TRP)''s Keystone XL pipeline would carry about
830,000 barrels a day from Canada''s oil-sands region to the
Gulf. Enbridge plans to ship 850,000 barrels a day to Texas
using its Canadian Mainline system and the Seaway pipeline,
which it co-owns with Enterprise, the biggest U.S. pipeline
operator. </p>
<p>Enbridge and Enterprise have applied for a market-based
tariff on the Seaway pipeline, which connects an oil-storage hub
at Cushing, Oklahoma, with refineries in Houston. The request
has has drawn protests from more than a dozen oil producers and
trade groups. TransCanada hasn''t said what rates it will seek on
the Keystone line. </p>
<p>The court''s decision on the Pegasus pipeline could affect
how the commission decides Seaway and other pipeline tariff
requests, said Jack Semrani, an attorney with Ballard Spahr LLP
in Washington. </p>
<h2>More Careful'' </h2>
<p>The full impact won''t be known until the agency decides
whether to appeal, said Semrani, who represents a group
protesting the Seaway tariff request. </p>
<p>If FERC doesn''t appeal this and this becomes the law,
then FERC is going to have to be more careful in withholding
market-based rates, Semrani said in a phone interview today. </p>
<p>TransCanada hasn''t applied for rates on the Keystone line
and can''t speculate what form they might take, Shawn Howard, a
TransCanada spokesman, wrote in an e-mailed message. Rick
Rainey, a spokesman for Enterprise, declined to commented on the
company''s tariff request. </p>
<p>The case is Mobil Pipeline Co. v. Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, 11-1021, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit (Washington). </p>

Levitt" date="Apr 17, 2012  4:40 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-17/morgan-stanley-signs-lease-to-expand-at-1-new-york-plaza-tower.html"><headline>Morgan Stanley to Expand at Manhattan''s 1 New York Plaza</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, signed a lease for almost 1.2 million
square feet (111,480 square meters) of space at Brookfield
Office Properties Inc. (BPO)''s 1 New York Plaza in lower Manhattan. </p>
<p>The bank, which currently occupies about 816,000 square
feet at the building, will expand by an additional 337,000
square feet under a deal that runs through 2029, Brookfield said
in a statement today. The agreement is the largest office lease
for a single building in the city since 2008, according to the
New York-based landlord. </p>
<p>The deal follows a weak quarter for office leasing as Wall
Street firms cut jobs and delayed decisions on space. Studley
Inc., a New York-based brokerage, projected last month that
agreements would be signed for the rental of about 5.7 million
square feet this year through March. That would be the smallest
quarterly tally since the 4.5 million square feet leased in the
second quarter of 2009, when demand froze in the aftermath of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.''s bankruptcy. </p>
<p>For a major financial institution to make a decision of
this scale is a big positive, for the market and for us,
Brookfield Chief Investment Officer Dennis Friedrich said in a
telephone interview. There are a number of large tenants
moving toward making large space decisions. A 15-year-plus
commitment is a good signal to the market. </p>
<h2>Consolidating Space </h2>
<p>One New York Plaza, at the foot of Manhattan near Battery
Park, has 2.6 million square feet of space and is one of New
York''s largest office buildings. Morgan Stanley (MS), based at 1585
Broadway in midtown Manhattan, will consolidate operations
currently in Jersey City, New Jersey; Brooklyn; and Midtown to
the tower, Friedrich said. </p>
<p>The additional 337,000 square feet that the bank is taking
was vacated by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) when it moved into its
new headquarters on West Street, Friedrich said. It doesn''t
include two 45,000-square-foot trading floors near the top of
the 50-story skyscraper. </p>
<p>Brookfield''s negotiations with Morgan Stanley took more
than a year. Friedrich attributed the slow progress to the
complexities of the consolidation that the company was
contemplating. </p>
<p>They did not step away from the table and there wasn''t a
period of time where they were questioning whether they were
going to do this, he said. </p>
<p>Matt Burkhard, a Morgan Stanley spokesman, declined to
comment on the deal or the plans for consolidation. The bank was
represented by brokers including Newmark Grubb Knight Frank
Chief Executive Officer Barry Gosin and Vice Chairman Brian
Waterman. A Newmark spokeswoman, Mira Matic, said the firm
wouldn''t comment. </p>
<h2>Outside Manhattan </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley currently has offices at 1 Pierrepont Plaza
in downtown Brooklyn, and at Harborside Financial Center in
Jersey City. Many Manhattan-based financial companies pushed
back-office operations into locations across the Hudson and East
rivers in the 1980s and 1990s to save money. </p>
<p>The lease signing at 1 New York Plaza indicates demand
for functional space in a transportation-centric, amenity-rich
location at a low cost, John Guinee, an analyst with Stifel
Nicolaus  Co. in Baltimore, said in an e-mail. Morgan Stanley
is consolidating into a building where they are already
ensconced and taking more high-quality, technology-rich space at
a bargain price. </p>
<p>Brookfield gained 2 percent to $17.56 in New York trading.
The stock has advanced 12 percent this year, compared with a 9.6
percent increase in the Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate Index. (DJUSRE) </p>
<h2>Building 85% Occupied </h2>
<p>For Brookfield, one of the biggest benefits of the deal is
that it puts to bed about 950,000 square feet of leases at 1
New York Plaza that would have expired in 2014, said Friedrich,
who declined to disclose the rent Morgan Stanley will be paying.
The agreement leaves the building about 85 percent occupied, he
said. </p>
<p>Brookfield still has two other major challenges in
Manhattan, its largest market. One is re-leasing more than 3
million square feet of Bank of America Corp. leases at
downtown''s World Financial Center that expire next year. The
other is to find anchor tenants for the 5.4 million-square-foot
Manhattan West skyscraper project west of Pennsylvania Station
in Midtown. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world''s largest
soft-drink maker, reported first-quarter profit that topped
analysts'' estimates, helped by pricing increases and demand in
North America. </p>
<p>Net income rose 7.9 percent to $2.05 billion, or 89 cents a
share, from $1.9 billion, or 82 cents, a year earlier, Atlanta-
based Coca-Cola said today in a statement. Analysts projected 87
cents, the average of 14 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent has introduced smaller
package sizes to attract price-conscious consumers as part of an
effort to spur sales in North America, where the soft drink
industry is in a seven-year decline. Beverage sales volume for
the unit climbed 2 percent in the quarter, driven by demand for
Powerade energy drinks and Dasani water, contributing to a 5
percent gain globally. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola''s volume growth was very strong this quarter
and despite commodity pressures and clear marketing
reinvestment, they delivered strong profitability, Ali Dibadj,
a New York-based analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein  Co., said
today in an e-mail. Dibadj rates the shares outperform, the
equivalent of a buy. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola rose 2.1 percent to $73.95 at the close in New
York. The shares have gained 5.7 percent this year, while
PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) is little changed. </p>
<h2>Global Pricing </h2>
<p>Revenue advanced 5.9 percent to $11.1 billion, according to
the statement. The company raised global pricing 3 percent in
the quarter, outpacing last year''s 1.5 increase. </p>
<p>The North America unit, Coca-Cola''s largest, accounted for
about 44 percent of global sales. The Pacific unit, the
company''s second-largest region, boosted volume sales 8 percent,
compared with 5 percent growth a year earlier. The division was
helped by a 3 percent jump in Japan. </p>
<p>In emerging markets, India jumped 20 percent while Brazil
increased 4 percent, as both outpaced gains in the first quarter
a year earlier. China advanced 9 percent. </p>
<p>Gross margin narrowed to 61 percent from 62.5 percent a
year earlier. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) has set
the bar for challengers at this summer''s charity decathlon to
crown the best athlete on Wall Street. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs had the top two finishers and was the top
fundraising company in last year''s event, a 10-discipline
competition that raised about $500,000 for patient care and
research at New York''s Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. </p>
<p>Registration for the fourth annual decathlon opens today
and Brad Bagdis, a former Harvard University football captain at
Knight Capital Group Inc., is among those challenging the
Goldman Sachs team. Bagdis, 27, was third last year behind
Goldman''s Justin Nunez, a former defensive back at Columbia
University, and Kyle VanFleet, who played fullback at Georgetown
University. </p>
<p>I''d be lying if I told you we weren''t gunning for them a
little bit this year, Bagdis, who''s in his fourth year as an
institutional sales trader at Knight Capital, said in a
telephone interview. It''s a bit of a rivalry. I played
football against Nunez when he was at Columbia. </p>
<p>Nunez, in his third year working in the investment
management division at Goldman Sachs, won the decathlon title
last year after finishing third in 2010. </p>
<p>His victory came before family, friends and colleagues at
his alma mater, as the competition was held at Columbia''s Wien
Stadium on the northern tip of Manhattan. This year''s event,
which tests speed, strength and agility, will again be held at
Columbia on July 29. Registration information is available at
the event''s website, thedecathlon.org. </p>
<h2>Defending Champion </h2>
<p>After finishing third, my focus was on winning, Nunez,
who finished with 7,095 points, 27 ahead of VanFleet, said by e-
mail. Now that I''ve achieved that goal, I would like nothing
more than to hold on to the trophy for one more year. </p>
<p>Bagdis and Nunez, 28, are among a group of former Ivy
League football players who plan to take part this year. Former
University of Pennsylvania defensive end David Betten of George
Weiss Associates and former Columbia offensive lineman Ralph
DeBernardo of J.P. Morgan also have committed. </p>
<p>Awards are presented to the top three finishers as well as
the top executive performer, the winners in three age groups
(under 30, 30-39 and over 40), and the top fundraiser. </p>
<p>Tom McGuirk, the managing director of HighTower Advisors in
Menlo Park, California, traveled to New York and took top honors
in the executive division last year. The 41-year-old McGuirk
competed in the 400-meter hurdles for Ireland in the 1996 and
2000 Olympics. </p>
<h2>Events </h2>
<p>While the competition features runs at three distances --
40 yards, 400 meters and 800 meters -- that''s where its
similarities to the Olympic-style decathlon ends. Pull-ups, a
football throw, an agility drill, rowing, a vertical jump, bench
press and dips -- a triceps exercise using one''s own weight --
are also part of the one-day contest. </p>
<p>The field is limited to 150 competitors, each of whom must
raise $3,000 in contributions. Bloomberg LP, the parent company
of Bloomberg News, is among the event''s corporate sponsors. </p>
<p>Bagdis raised $10,710 last year. His roommate, colleague
and training partner Brian Ceglarski, 27, brought in almost
$13,000, helping Knight Capital rank third in team fund raising
in 2011 behind Goldman Sachs ($37,146) and Bank of America
Corp.''s Merrill Lynch ($24,301). They have higher goals this
year, with at least two other co-workers joining the event and
strong support from management at the Jersey City, New Jersey-
based securities firm. </p>
<h2>Strong Support </h2>
<p>We''ve got a lot of help from the top guys who are
athletes themselves, said the 6-foot-5 Ceglarski, who won the
rowing event in record time last year and plays hockey in a
league once a week at Chelsea Piers. They''ve been supportive
financially and in getting the word out there. </p>
<p>Bagdis, who''s 6-foot-3 and 230 pounds -- down about 30
pounds from his playing weight as a defensive end and linebacker
at Harvard -- said he arrives at the office at 5 a.m. on
weekdays. He spends about an hour preparing for his work day and
then goes to the company gym downstairs for about an hour and 15
minutes before getting back to his desk for a daily team call at
7:30 a.m. </p>
<p>While he''s preparing for all 10 events, Bagdis said last
year''s experience made clear his weaknesses. </p>
<p>Being a bigger guy, I''m going to focus more on the
running, Bagdis said. It was absolutely brutal, the 400 and
800 meters. I''m just not built for long distance. </p>
<p>Doug Schlack, a 28-year-old junior bond broker in his fifth
year at BGC Partners Inc. (BGCP), finished fifth in his debut at the
decathlon in 2011 and said this year he wants to match the
victory by his younger brother, Chris, at the event in 2010. </p>
<p>Doug Schlack said he isn''t focused on the team from Goldman
Sachs, even though he knows he''ll have to get past the defending
champion to bring his family a second title. </p>
<p>I wouldn''t say I necessarily aim for those guys,
Schlack said. I just know if I stay consistent -- now that I
know what to expect -- I should be able to compete again. And as
much as you want to win this event, you can''t forget the cause
we''re all there for, raising money for cancer awareness and
having fun being able to compete. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, set aside $4.4 billion to pay
employees in the first quarter, 16 percent less than a year
earlier, as revenue fell and the company cut jobs. </p>
<p>The amount, which covers salaries, benefits and accruals
for year-end bonuses, is enough to give each of the firm''s
32,400 employees $135,123. A year earlier, the New York-based
firm''s $5.23 billion first-quarter compensation expense equaled
$147,825 for each of the 35,400 employees at the time. </p>
<p>Wall Street firms including Goldman Sachs, led by Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, are reducing jobs and
compensation to preserve profit. Europe''s debt crisis and new
regulations have weighed on trading revenue, while slow economic
growth limited fees for takeovers and financing. </p>
<p>The dynamic for the trading companies has changed -- I
just don''t think they''re going to be able to make the kind of
money they used to make, Mark Bronzo, a portfolio manager who
helps oversee $125 billion for Guggenheim Investments in
Irvington, New York, said before the figures were released. </p>
<p>The sum set aside by Goldman Sachs equals 44 percent of
revenue, about the same as in the first quarter of 2011.
Blankfein, 57, received a 35 percent cut in his own compensation
for last year to $12.4 million after earnings dropped 47 percent
and the stock tumbled 46 percent. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) sold about $1
billion of commercial-mortgage bonds after widening the relative
yields on some classes, according to people familiar with the
transaction. </p>
<p>A top-ranked slice maturing in 9.91 years, initially
marketed to yield 110 basis points more than the benchmark swap
rate, paid 115 basis over the benchmark, said the people, who
declined to be identified because the terms aren''t public. The
spread on debt rated A3 by Moody''s Investors Service yields 425
basis points, after being marketed to pay 400 basis points, the
people said. </p>
<p>Landlords are borrowing more against their properties in
commercial-mortgage bond deals planned through June, according
to Moody''s. Transactions slated to be marketed during the second
quarter include pools with average loan sizes approaching or
exceeding the value of the buildings as calculated by Moody''s,
the New York-based ratings company said in a report this week.
Banks may have to boost investor protections if underwriting
standards keep sliding, it said. </p>
<p>Commercial-mortgage bond sales have been reviving, with
banks arranging about $28 billion of the securities last year,
up from $11.5 billion in 2010, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. About $5 billion has been sold this year, compared
with a record $232.5 billion in 2007. </p>
<p>Relative yields on commercial-mortgage bonds surged earlier
this month when the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said it was
considering selling portions of its portfolio assumed in the
2008 rescue of American International Group Inc., fueling
concerns that a flood of bonds would depress values. The spread
has since narrowed to 186 basis points, or 1.86 percentage
points, more than Treasuries after reaching a six-week high of
206 basis points on April 10, according to a Barclays index. </p>
<p>The Fed invited eight dealers to bid on the $7.5 billion
portion of the portfolio linked to commercial real estate CDOs,
the district bank said today in a statement. </p>

<p>Pipeline companies offer the best
returns in energy for investors seeking to cash in on the U.S.
shale boom while avoiding the volatility of a commodity market
that''s seen natural-gas prices reach a 10-year-low and crude
bounce above $100 a barrel. </p>
<p>The BLOOMBERG RISKLESS RETURN RANKING shows pipeline
companies in the past five years have provided triple the risk-
adjusted return of companies that produce and refine oil and
gas, such as Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the next best group. Enbridge
Inc. (ENB) of Canada leads companies on the Bloomberg World Pipelines
Index, which returned 2.9 percent when adjusted for price
swings. Producers focused on finding and extracting oil and gas
gained 0.5 percent. </p>
<p>Pipelines are the toll roads of the energy industry,
inoculated against price swings thanks to long-term contracts
that lock in fees based on the volume of products they ship.
Demand for shipping is expected to grow as oil and gas drilling
accelerates in U.S. shale fields. With energy''s best returns and
lowest risk, pipelines have attracted investors such as Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which owns 19.1 percent of Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMI),
the parent of the second-biggest U.S. pipeline company. </p>
<p>These are companies that have multiyear contracts
involving products that are essential to the functioning of
society, said Randle Smith, a portfolio manager with Duff 
Phelps Investment Management Co. who helps manage $4.9 billion
of global utilities and infrastructure investments, including
more than 2 million Enbridge shares. They''re not taking on
commodity price risks, so it''s a very secure business model. </p>
<h2>Enbridge''s Lowest Risk </h2>
<p>The risk-adjusted return, which isn''t annualized, is
calculated by dividing total return by volatility, or the degree
of daily price-swing variation, giving a measure of income per
unit of risk. A higher volatility means the price of an asset
can swing dramatically in a short period of time, increasing the
potential for unexpected losses compared with a security whose
price moves at a steady rate. </p>
<p>Enbridge provided a 6.8 percent risk-adjusted return in the
past five years, the highest among the 89 companies on the
Standard  Poor''s Global 1200 Energy Index (SGES), as well as among the
20 biggest pipeline companies in the world as measured by market
value. The return was more than triple the 2.1 percent average
on the Cushing 30 MLP index, which includes many competitors
that operate as partnerships. </p>
<h2>Better Than Exxon </h2>
<p>The Calgary-based operator''s risk-adjusted return was
almost 10 times that of Exxon, which has the top credit rating
from three rating companies and is a mainstay of energy
portfolios around the world due to its stable returns and
dividends. Enbridge had higher returns than 94 percent of energy
stocks on the SP Global index. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Pat Daniel sees no reason for the
company to take on riskier investments. </p>
<p>That''s Enbridge, he said in an interview. We''re not a
Hail Mary'' kind of company. We''re a grind it out, win it every
day, consistent performer. </p>
<p>Enbridge returned 150 percent to shareholders in the past
five years through price appreciation and dividends, the highest
among pipeline companies. Enbridge has earned $5.53 billion for
shareholders since 2007, slightly higher than the $5.45 billion
of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP (KMP), which had the second-
highest risk-adjusted return of pipeline operators after
Enbridge. </p>
<p>Enbridge fell 0.3 percent to C$38.83 at the close in
Toronto. </p>
<h2>Stability Hallmark </h2>
<p>Enbridge had the second-lowest volatility of the pipeline
companies after TransCanada Corp. (TRP), another Calgary-based company
that is seeking to build a pipeline from Canada''s oil sands to
the Texas coast. </p>
<p>Stability has been a hallmark of pipeline companies, whose
shipping agreements with refiners and oil and gas producers
often last for decades and include regular price increases.
Though rising prices can chip away at demand, during the
recession of 2007 to 2009, gasoline demand dropped just 3
percent, said Chris Eades, who helps manage more than $2 billion
in a pair of pipeline-oriented funds at Legg Mason (LM)''s ClearBridge
Advisors in New York. </p>
<p>A 3 percent swing in volumes is not going to make or
break one of these pipeline companies'' ability to pay their
distribution, he said. </p>
<h2>Soaring Demand for Pipes </h2>
<p>The need for pipelines soared in the past five years as
improved technology allowed companies to expand production in
U.S. shale-rock formations and Canada''s oil sands. North
American output may grow 70 percent by 2020, possibly surpassing
that of the Middle East, according to Citigroup Inc. </p>
<p>Oil production in North Dakota reached 535,000 barrels a
day in January and could grow to 1 million by 2020, said Dan Spears, a fund manager at Swank Capital LLC. Production in the
Eagle Ford Shale, almost non-existent in 2007, may grow to
850,000 barrels a day by the middle of this year. </p>
<p>All these guys have got to build more storage and more
pipelines to get their oil to market, Spears said. </p>
<p>Pipelines have cost advantages over other sectors of the
industry. Drilling for oil and gas has become more expensive as
exploration moves farther offshore or into more drilling-
intensive formations like shale, said Bob Brackett, an analyst
with Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in New York. The cost of finding
and developing a barrel of oil has risen 14 percent annually for
the past 10 years. </p>
<h2>Tougher Rocks </h2>
<p>Some of the inflation is cyclical, based on the price of
labor; the rest is a result of the rocks getting tougher and
requiring more expensive production techniques, Brackett said in
an interview. Reducing those costs would take a technical
breakthrough that we haven''t seen yet. </p>
<p>While the cost of drilling was rising, market volatility
pushed oil to $145.29 a barrel in 2008, then down to $33.87 the
same year before rising again to about $102 this month. Natural
gas reached $13.577 per million British thermal units in 2008
then fell this month to less than $1.975, the lowest since 2002. </p>
<p>Those price swings have cut into profits for both explorers
and refiners such as Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC) and Valero Energy
Corp. (VLO) Rising prices for Brent crude, the international
benchmark, has increased costs and hurt profitability for U.S.
refiners on the East Coast, which rely on imports to process
fuel, said Zach Parham, an analyst with Bloomberg Industries. </p>
<h2>International Oil Spikes </h2>
<p>Brent spiked to a high of $126.65 in 2011 as political
turmoil spread in the Middle East. It rose again to a high of
$126.22 this year, driven by demand from China and Iran''s threat
to close the Strait of Hormuz, the sea lane that carries a fifth
of the world''s oil, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Oil service and equipment companies also have seen more
volatility as fluctuating prices drove demand for drilling. The
15-company Philadelphia Oil Service Sector Index (OSX) returned 0.1
percent, after adjusting for volatility, during a five-year
period that saw offshore demand evaporate in the Gulf of Mexico
following the 2010 BP Plc oil spill and onshore demand explode
from new shale fields. </p>
<p>Many of the pipeline networks operated by Enbridge and its
rivals were already in place when the North American drilling
boom began. The U.S. already had 278,000 miles (447,000
kilometers) of gas transmission lines and 160,000 miles of oil
and products lines, according to the U.S. Transportation
Department. </p>
<h2>Well-Placed Networks </h2>
<p>Many of Enbridge''s existing pipelines were already in or
near the new sources of oil and gas, ClearBridge''s Eades said.
Its Canadian mainline system was built in the 1950s, for
instance, and was well-positioned when Canada''s tar sands region
began producing oil. </p>
<p>It''s not all clear sailing for pipelines. Many new projects
are facing increasing environmental scrutiny and greater
oversight by regulators concerned about leaks and safety.
Environmental groups were able to block TransCanada''s proposed
Keystone XL line from Canada to Texas, at least temporarily,
because of concerns it might pollute water in Nebraska. </p>
<p>At the same time, new gas fields such as the Marcellus
Shale in Pennsylvania have been developed closer to major East
Coast cities, reducing the need for long-haul pipelines to those
areas, said Greg Reid, managing director of Salient Partners LP,
which has about $600 million invested in energy infrastructure. </p>
<p>Companies are finding ways to adapt, often by expanding or
repurposing existing pipelines. </p>
<h2>Reconfiguring Existing Pipes </h2>
<p>Kinder Morgan plans to boost its oil shipments in Canada by
expanding its decades-old Trans Mountain pipeline, which runs
from Alberta to Vancouver. Kinder also is considering a
conversion of its Pony Express gas line to carry oil from
expanding production in North Dakota''s Bakken shale. </p>
<p>Spectra Energy Corp. (SE), whose Texas Eastern system has
shipped gas northward since the 1940s, said April 12 it may
reverse part of the system to carry gas from the Marcellus to
new power plants in the U.S. Southeast. </p>
<p>After the Keystone project was blocked, Enterprise Products
Partners LP (EPD) has worked with Enbridge to reverse the Seaway
pipeline between Cushing, Oklahoma, and Houston. Coupled with
other expansions, the project will enable Enbridge to ship an
additional 500,000 barrels a day of crude from Canada to Texas. </p>
<p>Daniel, the Enbridge CEO, sees no reason to change the
business model any time soon. </p>
<p>Our society is kind of aimed at rewarding risk-takers,
but if you can get to the end result without taking risk, why do
it? he said. Why risk your investors'' money if you can get
there with a low-risk investment? </p>

<p>(Corrects name of investor in final paragraph.) </p>
<p>Spotify Ltd. will incorporate its
music streaming service with Coca-Cola Co. (KO)''s Internet marketing,
to help raise awareness and draw users. </p>
<p>The music-streaming service will be the key underlying
technology for Coca-Cola Music globally and the soft-drink
maker will integrate Spotify into its Facebook presence,
Atlanta-based Coca-Cola said today in a joint statement with
London-based Spotify. </p>
<p>Spotify''s top priority is to attract more paying
subscribers and users to its advertising-supported service,
Daniel Ek, founder and chief executive officer, said in an April
13 interview in the Swedish newspaper Dagens Industri. The
company created a play button last week that allows legal
streams of songs and albums to be embedded on websites. EK also
added an artist radio feature that plays music by a particular
band and similar acts, to compete with Pandora Media Inc. (P) </p>
<p>The deal with Coca-Cola will will help bring Spotify to
more parts of the world, Ek told reporters in New York today. </p>
<h2>Paying Listeners </h2>
<p>Spotify added 500,000 subscribers two months after the
service became available on Facebook Inc. (FB)''s social network, the
company said in November, bringing the number of paying
listeners to 2.5 million. Listeners pay $4.99 for the service on
personal computers or $9.99 for PCs and mobile devices. </p>
<p>The service is also trying to win over artists. Adele, the
Black Keys, Coldplay and Tom Waits have withheld new releases
from Spotify, which began U.S. service in July. Last week, the
company announced exclusive access to songs and albums by the
Red Hot Chili Peppers. </p>
<p>The company is also facing competition from other
subscription music services including Rdio Inc., as well as
online ventures by Viacom Inc. (VIAB)''s MTV, AOL Inc. and Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) </p>
<p>Spotify lost about $59 million on revenue of $250 million
last year, Ek said in the Dagens Industri interview. The service
paid about $150 million to rights holders in 2011, compared with
$55 million in 2010. </p>
<p>The company raised $100 million last year from venture
capital investors including DST Global, Accel Partners and
Kleiner Perkins Caufield  Byers, achieving a valuation of about
$1 billion. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world''s
largest software maker, reported fiscal third-quarter profit
that topped estimates on better-than-expected sales of software
for businesses. </p>
<p>Net income slipped to $5.11 billion, or 60 cents a share,
from $5.23 billion, or 61 cents, a year earlier, Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft said today in a statement. Analysts
had predicted an average 57 cents in profit, according to
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose to 6 percent to
$17.4 billion, beating the $17.2 billion average projection. </p>
<p>Microsoft benefited from robust corporate purchasing of
Office productivity programs, Windows 7 operating systems and
software for servers. The company plans later this year to
release Windows 8, the newest version of its operating system,
to help it win back consumers and narrow Apple Inc.''s lead in
the market for tablets. </p>
<p>These are the kind of quarters that are tough to pull
out, and the corporate demand is pulling them through, said
Pat Becker Jr., a fund manager at Becker Capital Management in
Portland, Oregon, who owns Microsoft shares. </p>
<p>Microsoft shares climbed as much as 3.2 percent to $32 in
extended trading after the report. The stock had decreased less
than 1 percent to $31.01 at the close in New York. It gained 24
percent in the three months through the end of March, the
biggest quarterly increase since mid-2009, as investors grow
more confident about the prospects for Windows 8. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the
world''s largest brokerage, said its net exposure to five of
Europe''s most-indebted nations was $2.41 billion, down from
$3.06 billion in January. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s net exposure to the five countries --
Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain -- was $4.01 billion
before hedges, according to figures posted yesterday on the New
York-based bank''s website. Net exposure to France rose to $4.14
billion from $1.71 billion as of Dec. 31. </p>
<p>Concern that Europe''s debt crisis would spark bank losses
contributed to a 41 percent tumble for Morgan Stanley''s shares
in the third quarter of last year. The firm said in October that
its net exposure to the five was $3 billion, helping halt the
decline of the shares. </p>
<p>Spain accounted for the majority of the net exposure to the
so-called GIIPS nations, with $1.32 billion. That included $833
million in unfunded commitments, and a negative $493 million in
net inventory. The firm had a net short position of $137 million
on Portugal. A short position is a wager the price of a security
will fall. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley had $6.44 billion of net exposure to the
five countries, including $4.9 billion to Italy, as of Dec. 31.
After it restructured a derivative with the Italian government,
which settled on Jan. 3, those amounts dropped to $3.06 billion

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) climbed in New York
trading as first-quarter results beat analysts'' estimates and
stock- and bond-trading revenue rose more than at any other
major U.S. bank. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley advanced 41 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $18.07
at 4:15 p.m. in New York, the fourth-biggest increase on the 81-
company (S5FINL) Standard  Poor''s 500 Financials Index. Profit was 71
cents a share excluding accounting charges, topping the 44-cent
average estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Fixed-income trading revenue surged 34 percent, surpassing
the 19 percent gain at Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc.''s drop of more than 15 percent, excluding accounting
adjustments. Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer James Gorman
has set a goal of 15 percent return on equity after lingering
pressures from the financial crisis held that measure below 10
percent for five straight years. The gauge was 9.2 percent for
the first quarter. </p>
<p>You had very favorable tailwinds in the fixed-income
markets, and so trading revenues are very strong, Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales Partners LLC in New York, said
in an interview on Bloomberg Radio''s Bloomberg Surveillance with
Tom Keene and Ken Prewitt. The question is the
sustainability. </p>
<p>Including the $2 billion accounting adjustment, the firm
had a net loss of $94 million, or 6 cents a share, compared with
profit of $968 million, or 50 cents, a year earlier, the New
York-based company said today in a statement. </p>
<h2>Share Performance </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s shares are up 19 percent this year. They
fell 44 percent in 2011, the biggest decline since 2008, and
through yesterday were 40 percent below where they traded when
Gorman took over at the beginning of 2010. </p>
<p>This quarter is further evidence that Morgan Stanley has
rebounded from the financial crisis of 2008, Gorman, 53, said
in the statement. </p>
<p>The accounting charge is known as a debt-valuation
adjustment, or DVA. It stems from increases in the value of the
company''s debt, under the theory it would be more expensive to
buy back the securities. Morgan Stanley booked $3.4 billion of
gains in the third quarter of last year as its credit spreads
widened. </p>
<p>Revenue at Morgan Stanley climbed to $8.91 billion from
$7.76 billion a year earlier, excluding accounting adjustments.
Book value per share dropped to $30.74 from $31.42 at the end of
2011. </p>
<h2>Best Quarter'' </h2>
<p>Great trading results, OK banking and wealth-management
numbers and solid expense trends all combined to produce
the best quarter we''ve seen at MS in a long time, Glenn
Schorr, an analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc., wrote in a note to
clients today, referring to the firm by its stock ticker. </p>
<p>First-quarter revenue from fixed-income sales and trading,
which is run by Ken deRegt along with commodity trading co-heads
Colin Bryce and Simon Greenshields, was $2.59 billion, excluding
DVA. That topped estimates of $2.02 billion from Fiona Swaffield, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, and $1.85 billion
from Citigroup''s Keith Horowitz. </p>
<p>Fixed-income revenue was $1.94 billion in the first quarter
of 2011 and $1.25 billion in the fourth quarter. Colm Kelleher,
co-president of the firm''s Institutional Securities division,
oversees the trading business. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s first-quarter fixed-income revenue,
excluding DVA, was $3.57 billion. Citigroup''s climbed to $4.74
billion, while JPMorgan Chase  Co. posted a 2 percent decline
to $5.02 billion. </p>
<h2>All Contributors'' </h2>
<p>There was balanced strength across products and across
geographies; there was no one particular driver of results,
Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, 54, said in an interview.
When you look at each of rates, foreign exchange, corporate
credit, commodities and even investment-grade securitization,
they were all contributors. </p>
<p>The bank benefited as the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index
climbed 12 percent in the quarter and credit spreads tightened.
The gains came after the European Central Bank expanded lending,
Greece reached an agreement with creditors in the biggest
sovereign-debt restructuring in history and the U.S.
unemployment rate fell. </p>
<p>In equities trading, headed by Ted Pick, Morgan Stanley''s
revenue rose 6 percent from the year-earlier period to $1.83
billion, excluding DVA. That was a 44 percent increase from the
fourth quarter''s $1.28 billion, and compared with $2.4 billion
at Goldman Sachs and $1.42 billion at JPMorgan. David Trone, an
analyst at JMP Securities LLC, had estimated revenue of $1.55
billion, while Atlantic Equities'' Richard Staite estimated $1.3
billion. </p>
<h2>Investment Banking </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley generated $851 million in first-quarter
revenue from investment banking, which is overseen by Paul J. Taubman. That figure, down 16 percent from a year earlier,
included $313 million from financial advisory, $172 million from
equity underwriting and $366 million from debt underwriting. </p>
<p>Global wealth management, overseen by Greg Fleming, posted
pretax income of $387 million, up from $344 million a year
earlier, as revenue climbed less than 1 percent to $3.41
billion. The division''s pretax profit margin rose to 11 percent
from 10 percent in the first quarter of 2011. </p>
<p>Gorman has set a target for that margin of more than 20
percent, and Fleming vowed to raise the margin to the mid-
teens by the middle of next year. Total client assets rose to
$1.74 trillion as the unit had $8.7 billion of fee-based net
inflows. </p>
<h2>Citigroup Venture </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley has the option to buy a 14 percent stake in
the venture from Citigroup next month, increasing its ownership
to 65 percent, and can buy the business outright over the next
two years. Citigroup Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach
indicated this week that the bank may be willing to sell the
rest of its stake to Morgan Stanley this year. </p>
<p>Porat declined to say whether Morgan Stanley would try to
buy the rest of Citigroup''s stake this year. She said the firm
only asked for approval for a 14 percent purchase from the
Federal Reserve earlier this year. </p>
<p>Asset management reported a pretax gain of $128 million, up
from $125 million in the previous year''s period. </p>
<p>Compensation and benefits increased 3 percent from the
year-earlier quarter to $4.43 billion, or 64 percent of the
firm''s total revenue. The ratio was higher than in the first
quarter of 2011, when the bank set aside 57 percent of revenue.
Excluding DVA, the ratio fell to 50 percent from 55 percent. </p>
<h2>Severance Charge </h2>
<p>The results included a $138 million severance charge as the
firm followed through on a plan announced in December to cut
1,600 jobs in response to the weak investment-banking and
trading environment. </p>
<p>Profit fell 13 percent last year to $4.11 billion. Return
on equity was 4 percent for the year as the firm took charges to
eliminate swap contracts purchased from MBIA Inc. and to convert
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.''s preferred stake to common
shares. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley faces a potential three-level downgrade of
its credit rating from Moody''s Investors Service, which will
take ratings actions on the largest global investment banks by
the end of June. That would be the largest cut among U.S. banks
and may force the firm to post more collateral on derivatives
trades and pay more to borrow. Porat said today that the firm
has taken steps to ensure that any downgrade would be
manageable. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley was the top-ranked adviser on announced
mergers in the first quarter and the No. 1 equity underwriter,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Facebook Inc., the
world''s largest social-networking service, said in February that
it picked Morgan Stanley to lead its initial public offering,
boosting the investment bank''s bid to claim first place in the
IPO league table for a third straight year. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the
world''s biggest brokerage, sees a potential three-level credit-
rating downgrade from Moody''s Investors Service as manageable,
Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said. </p>
<p>We''ve done a lot to narrow the impact of any potential
ratings change, Porat said in an interview today. Our view
is that the potential outcomes are manageable, and I think our
clients understand that. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley faces what would be the largest credit-
rating cut among U.S. banks, which may force the firm to post
more collateral on derivatives trades and pay more to borrow.
Moody''s said it will take ratings actions on the largest global
investment banks by the end of June. A three-level cut would
reduce Morgan Stanley''s grade from A2 to Baa2. </p>
<p>Moody''s will need to incorporate data from last month''s
Federal Reserve stress test, which Morgan Stanley passed, and
first-quarter results, Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said
on a conference call with analysts. </p>
<p>They now have the benefit of two concrete pieces of
information that they didn''t have, said Gorman, 53. It''s
important and constructive that they''re delaying their readout
on this until early June as they try and assimilate all of that
plus the feedback that they''ve had from the industry. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley has cut back its structured derivatives
business, which would be most affected by a downgrade, Porat
said. The firm also has moved more derivatives to central
clearinghouses, a probable requirement of regulations stemming
from the Dodd-Frank Act, and has a higher-rated subsidiary it
could use for some trades, said Porat, 54. </p>
<h2>Relevant Parts'' </h2>
<p>We''ve reduced the universe of relevant parts of the
business or positions that would be affected by any kind of a
change, she said. </p>
<p>The firm''s clients also don''t rely solely on Moody''s, Porat
said. Morgan Stanley is rated A- by Standard  Poor''s and A by
Fitch Ratings. </p>
<p>A lot of clients are doing their own credit work, she
said. </p>
<p>BlackRock Inc. (BLK), the world''s biggest asset manager, said
earlier this week that it may be forced to reduce business with
some banks if their credit ratings are lowered. </p>
<p>I don''t think there''s any possibility we''re not going to
be doing business with BlackRock, Gorman said today in an
interview on Bloomberg Television. It''s only certain
individual contracts and we''ve created a number of workaround
situations where we can deal with this. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is in
talks with a Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) unit to sell its Petershill
fund that buys stakes in hedge funds, according to two people
familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>The negotiations with New York-based Asset Management
Finance LLC haven''t yet led to an agreement and the talks may

because the information is private. </p>
<p>Brian Finn, chief executive officer of Asset Management
Finance, didn''t immediately return calls seeking comment on the
talks, which were reported by the New York Times yesterday. </p>
<p>Petershill was started in 2007 and bought stakes of between
8 percent and 9 percent in hedge funds, including Winton Capital
Management Ltd. and Capula Investment Management LLP in London.
The Goldman fund, which was previously run by Jonathan Sorrell,
also invested in Level Global Investors LP, which liquidated
after being raided by the FBI in 2010, and Shumway Capital
Partners LLC, which closed last year. </p>

<p>James A. Johnson, the longest-
serving member of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s board, is being
opposed for re-election by a fund management company that boasts
long-time links with billionaire Warren Buffett. </p>
<p>Ruane, Cunniff  Goldfarb Inc., the New York firm that
helps oversee $15 billion, including the $5.7 billion Sequoia
Fund Inc. (SEQUX), criticized Johnson''s role in egregious corporate
governance debacles in a letter on its website yesterday and
said it would also oppose Johnson if he stands for re-election
to the board of Target Inc. (TGT) The Financial Times reported on the
letter''s contents earlier today. </p>
<p>We believe that Mr. Johnson''s history should disqualify
him for service on the board of any public company, Chief
Executive Officer Robert D. Goldfarb and President David M. Poppe, co-managers of the Sequoia Fund, wrote in the letter to
clients. We respectfully ask that you vote your Goldman Sachs
proxy against him. </p>
<p>Johnson, 68, has been chairman of the compensation
committee at Goldman Sachs since it became a public company in
1999. Ruane, Cunniff has managed 1.4 million Goldman Sachs
shares since April 2010, including 435,000 held in the Sequoia
Fund. The board of Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by
assets, has recommended that shareholders re-elect Johnson,
David Wells, a company spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>He has served them well since 1999 and will continue to
do so, Wells said. Johnson didn''t immediately reply to a phone
message left at his office in Washington. </p>
<h2>Graham Acolytes </h2>
<p>The public rebuke by an investor comes in the same week
that a majority of shareholders of Citigroup Inc. (C), the third-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, voted against a compensation plan
for executives including CEO Vikram Pandit. </p>
<p>Sequoia Fund was co-founded in 1970 by Richard Cunniff and
William Ruane, a friend of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) CEO Buffett
since both studied under value investor Benjamin Graham at
Columbia University. When Buffett shut down his investment
partnership in 1969 to concentrate on Berkshire Hathaway, he
recommended that his clients invest with Ruane. </p>
<p>Buffett, who disclosed earlier this week that he is being
treated for prostate cancer, last year redeemed his $5 billion
preferred-stock investment in Goldman Sachs that was made at the
depths of the financial crisis. He continues to hold warrants on
the stock and has been a supporter of Goldman Sachs Chairman and
CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein, 57. </p>
<h2>Beats Peers </h2>
<p>Sequoia Fund, which reopened to new investors in 2008 after
having been closed to outside money for 26 years, disclosed in a
regulatory filing in January that it was limiting new investment
through financial advisers and intermediaries. It said it would
continue to sell shares directly to investors. </p>
<p>Sequoia generated a 13.2 percent return last year,
outperforming 99 percent of its peers as well as the 2.1 percent
gain that the SP 500 index recorded when dividends are
included, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The fund had
a total return of 19.5 percent in 2010, a performance that led
Chicago-based Morningstar Inc. to designate Goldfarb and Poppe
as its domestic stock fund managers of the year. </p>
<p>Ruane, Cunniff voted against Johnson''s re-election to the
Goldman Sachs board and the Target board last year, according to
a person with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be
identified because the fund doesn''t disclose how it votes. </p>
<p>From 1991 until 1998, Johnson was chairman and CEO of
mortgage-finance company Fannie Mae, which was taken under
government protection in 2008. His tenure at Fannie Mae was a
central theme of the book Reckless Endangerment: How Outsized
Ambition, Greed and Corruption Led to Economic Armageddon by
Gretchen Morgenson and Joshua Rosner that was published last
year. </p>
<h2>Restated Earnings </h2>
<p>In their April 18 letter to investors, Goldfarb and Poppe
wrote that Fannie Mae used its status as a government-sponsored
entity to borrow money cheaply and dramatically expanded its
portfolio of retained mortgages during the 1990s. </p>
<p>Rather than act conservatively to protect taxpayers,
during Johnson''s tenure Fannie ramped up its growth by buying
lower-quality mortgages, according to the letter. This
bloated Fannie''s balance sheet, increased its profit and
magnified the risk to taxpayers. </p>
<p>The letter also cites Johnson''s tenures on the boards of
Minnetonka, Minnesota-based UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH), the biggest
U.S. health insurer, and Los Angeles-based homebuilder KB Home (KBH),
which both had to restate earnings after backdating option
grants to their CEOs. </p>
<p>Goldfarb and Poppe also cite media reports from 2008 that
said Johnson may have received below-market rates on home loans
from Countrywide Financial, which sold loans to Fannie Mae. </p>
<p>Following a June 7, 2008, report in the Wall Street Journal,
Johnson quit then-Senator Barack Obama''s vice-presidential
search committee to avoid distracting attention from Obama''s
candidacy and said that blatantly false statements and
misrepresentations were written about him. </p>

<p>Abby Joseph Cohen, senior U.S.
investment strategist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said equities
will give better returns than bonds in the mid-to-long term as
companies look to emerging markets for growth. </p>
<p>You need to go back to the late 1950s to see a situation
which equities were priced as attractively as they are now
relative to bonds, she said in a Bloomberg Radio interview
today with Tom Keene. 1958-1959 was a period in which
investors were very concerned about the economy and the yields
on many equities exceeded the yields on fixed income at that
point and -- as you know -- we moved into a multidecade bull
market in equities. </p>
<p>The Standard  Poor''s 500 Index (SPX) surged 26 percent through
yesterday from its 2011 low on Oct. 3 as economic data beat
economists'' forecasts and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke said he will keep interest rates low through at least
late 2014 to spur growth. </p>
<p>With yields at very low levels, bonds may not be all that
safe, she said. When yields do start to rise, as they may at
some point in the future, prices go down. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, set aside $2.11 billion to pay employees at
its investment-banking division in the first quarter, 10 percent
more than a year earlier. </p>
<p>Revenue at the unit rose 33 percent to $5 billion when the
impact of an accounting loss was excluded. Compensation at the
institutional-securities unit, which includes salaries, bonuses
and benefits for traders and bankers, was 42 percent of adjusted
revenue, down from 51 percent a year earlier when calculated on
the same basis, according to figures posted on the New York-
based firm''s website. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley has cut compensation, capped cash bonuses
and made clawbacks stricter as Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, 53, seeks to improve returns amid an industrywide
decline in revenue. Gorman took a 25 percent pay cut for last
year''s performance, and the firm limited immediate cash bonuses
to $125,000 as the shares fell 44 percent in 2011. </p>
<p>Companywide compensation and benefits rose 3 percent to
$4.43 billion as adjusted revenue increased 14 percent to $8.9
billion. That was enough to pay each of the firm''s 59,569
employees $74,384 on average for the period, more than the
$68,567 it set aside for each of the 62,494 employees a year
earlier, according to figures released today. The bank doesn''t
report how many people work in institutional securities. </p>
<p>The company recorded a $2 billion loss in the first quarter
from an accounting charge known as a debt valuation adjustment,
or DVA. It stems from increases in the value of the company''s
debt, under the theory that it would be more expensive to buy
back the securities. The $2 billion loss, which is included in
the institutional securities division, compares with a $189
million loss from DVA in the first quarter of last year, the
firm said today. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s brokerage division, which employed 17,193
financial advisers at the end of March, down from 18,124 a year
earlier, set aside $2.105 billion for pay, little changed from
$2.109 billion in the first quarter of 2011. The unit''s
compensation cost, which is set by a fixed grid for some
employees, was 62 percent of its revenue, the same as a year
earlier, the firm reported. </p>
<h2>JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said this week that it set aside
$4.4 billion to compensate staff in the first quarter, 16
percent less than a year earlier and enough to give each of its
32,400 employees $135,123. </p>
<p>Compensation costs at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s investment
bank fell 12 percent to $2.9 billion in the first quarter,
according to figures posted on the firm''s website last week. The
expense was enough to pay each of the division''s 25,707 workers
an average of $112,849 for the first three months of the year. </p>
<p>The average compensation figures are derived by dividing
the total compensation pool by the number of employees, and they
don''t represent individual workers'' actual pay. Investment banks
set aside revenue throughout the year for pay and typically
decide bonuses at year-end. </p>

Children, a New York-based nonprofit that works to transform
low-performing schools. </p>
<p>The grant over a three-year period will help pay for full-
time social workers and teacher-training dealing with the
disruptiveness of poverty. The cost of the Turnaround model at
each school is $250,000 a year. </p>
<p>Turnaround is committed to closing the gap, and so are
we, Kim Jasmin of the foundation said in the ballroom of the
Plaza Hotel. </p>
<p>More gifts followed on the occasion of Turnaround''s annual
benefit. </p>
<p>Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan''s chairman and chief executive,
pledged $25,000. D.E. Shaw Managing Director Trey Beck,
Turnaround''s chairman gave $32,000. Both men were absent;

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world''s
largest software maker, rose the most in three months after it
reported fiscal third-quarter profit that topped estimates on
better-than-expected sales of Windows and Office software for
businesses. </p>
<p>Net income slipped to $5.11 billion, or 60 cents a share,
from $5.23 billion, or 61 cents, a year earlier, Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft said yesterday in a statement.
Analysts had predicted an average 57 cents in profit, according
to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 6 percent to
$17.4 billion, beating the $17.2 billion average projection. </p>
<p>Microsoft, whose Windows business had missed analyst
estimates in four of the prior five quarters, surprised
investors with better-than-expected results as corporate demand
for Windows computers made up for tepid interest from consumers
opting for tablet machines. The company plans later this year to
release Windows 8, the newest version of its operating system,
to help it win back consumers and narrow Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s lead in
the tablet market. </p>
<p>It''s been a while since Windows did better than the
broader PC market, said Pat Becker Jr., a fund manager at
Becker Capital Management (NLY) in Portland, Oregon, who owns
Microsoft shares. Those trends we''ve seen over the past year
that the corporate market has been robust continued into Q1. </p>
<h2>Product Debuts </h2>
<p>Microsoft shares increased 4.6 percent to $32.42 as of the
close in New York, for the biggest advance since Jan. 20. The
stock has climbed 25 percent this year. </p>
<p>I''d characterize it as jumping high over a low hurdle,
Rick Sherlund, an analyst at Nomura Equity research, said in a
radio interview on Bloomberg Surveillance with Tom Keene.
We''re really waiting for these new products to ship and to
really reinvigorate the whole PC market. </p>
<p>Microsoft gave its first look at operating-cost projections
for the fiscal year that starts July 1, saying expenses will be
$30.3 billion to $30.9 billion. </p>
<p>That''s a gain of as much as 8 percent, higher than this
year''s increase, as the company plans for costs related to
product debuts in Windows and Office, Microsoft Chief Financial
Officer Peter Klein said in an interview. </p>
<p>In the current year, expenses will be $28.3 billion to
$28.7 billion, lower than a January forecast of $28.5 billion to
$28.9 billion. </p>
<p>Expenses are under renewed scrutiny because Microsoft''s
revenue growth is slowing, said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC
Partners LP in New York, who recommends buying Microsoft shares. </p>
<h2>Windows Gaining </h2>
<p>Sales in the current fiscal year are predicted by analysts
to rise 6 percent, compared with 12 percent in 2011. </p>
<p>It''s all about cost discipline because revenue growth
isn''t great, he said. </p>
<p>Unearned revenue, a measure of future sales, was $15.2
billion, above the $14.9 billion average estimate compiled by
Bloomberg. Profit in the year-ago quarter was boosted by a 5-
cent-a-share tax benefit. </p>
<p>Windows division sales rose 4 percent to $4.62 billion,
compared with the $4.2 billion average estimate, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. That was the fastest growth since
the quarter that ended Sept. 30, 2010, Microsoft said. </p>
<p>We are seeing year-over-year growth in Windows again, and
it''s actually looking like it''s growing faster than PCs, said
Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities LLC in
Portland, Oregon, who has a neutral rating on the shares. </p>
<h2>Office Outpaces </h2>
<p>Revenue in the Business division, mostly from Office
software, rose 9.1 percent to $5.81 billion. That shows that
demand for Office 2010 software, which was released in mid-2010,
has persisted longer than would be expected for an almost two-
year-old product, Microsoft''s Klein said. Analysts on average
had projected $5.6 billion. </p>
<p>Office has frankly been better than you would normally
expect at this point in the cycle, he said. </p>
<p>The Windows division was bolstered by purchases of Windows
7 software from enterprise customers. Shipments of corporate
machines rose 8 percent, while consumer demand was flat, Klein
said. </p>
<p>The increase in Windows sales was greater than the overall
increase in PC shipments reported by Gartner Inc. (IT) PC shipments
were better than expected in the first quarter, according to
market-research firm Gartner, rising 1.9 percent, instead of the
1.2 percent drop Gartner had forecast. The PC market is shaking
off the impact of the European debt crisis and a disk-drive
shortage resulting from last year''s flooding in Thailand. </p>
<p>Households that used to purchase cheap netbook computers
are switching to such devices as tablet computers, he said. A
new iPad went on sale last month and sold 3 million units in its
debut weekend. </p>
<h2>Windows 8 Cometh </h2>
<p>Microsoft probably won''t be able to alter that trend until
Windows 8 ships, Klein said in January. </p>
<p>While the company has declined to say when Windows 8 will
go on sale, people with knowledge of the matter said last month
that Microsoft will finish work on the product this summer and
put it on sale around October. </p>
<p>Another area of consumer weakness showed up in the division
that includes Xbox, where sales declined 16 percent to $1.62
billion, below analysts'' average estimate for sales of $2.1
billion. In what Microsoft termed a soft console market, the
company sold only 1.4 million Xbox 360 machines, down 48 percent
from the year-ago quarter. </p>
<p>Microsoft doesn''t plan to market a new version of its
gaming console until 2013 at the earliest, people with knowledge
of the matter said last month. That means Microsoft will need to
squeeze a few more quarters of sales from the device, and that
weaker demand for the current machine is a concern, Barnicle
said. </p>

<p>Rich Ross, chairman of Walt Disney
Co. (DIS)''s film unit, resigned following the company''s $200 million
loss on the science-fiction picture John Carter, possibly
the biggest ever for a single movie. </p>
<p>The departure of Ross, 50, who has run the division since
October 2009 and previously led the Disney Channel, was
announced today in a statement. A successor wasn''t named. </p>
<p>Disney Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger''s strategy of
producing fewer films, built around marketable characters such
as those from its Pixar and Marvel units, faltered with the
failure of John Carter. The movie will lead to a quarterly
loss of as much as $120 million for the studio, the first since
Ross succeeded Dick Cook as chairman. </p>
<p>I don''t know that anybody is shocked, said Martin Pyykkonen, an analyst with Wedge Partners in Greenwood Village,
Colorado, who doesn''t rate stocks. John Carter'' was a debacle
and probably the last straw, he said, citing past
disappointments including Mars Needs Moms. </p>
<p>Disney, based in Burbank, California, gained 0.6 percent to
$42.35 at the close in New York. The shares have risen 13
percent this year. </p>
<p>Ross, a 15-year Disney veteran, previously worked at and
led the Disney Channel, creating shows including High School
Musical and Hannah Montana, starring Miley Cyrus. </p>
<p>I appreciate his countless contributions throughout his
entire career at Disney, and expect he will have tremendous
success in whatever he chooses to do next, Iger said in the
statement. </p>
<h2>Studio Ranking </h2>
<p>Disney ranks seventh among studios in 2012 domestic ticket
sales with $186.7 million, according to researcher Box Office
Mojo. John Carter, made for about $250 million, generated
$269.4 million in worldwide ticket sales, a sum shared with
cinema operators. </p>
<p>The film went over budget and was poorly marketed,

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) must pay at least
$4 million in damages to a woman who developed breast cancer
after taking the company''s Prempro menopause drug, a jury in
Connecticut ruled. </p>
<p>Jurors in federal court in New Haven ruled April 18 that
Pfizer''s Wyeth unit was liable for causing Margaret Fraser''s
cancer and that Prempro was an unreasonably dangerous
product, Greg Bubalo, one of Fraser''s lawyers, said in a
telephone interview today. The panel also found Wyeth should pay
punitive damages over its handling of the drug, he said. </p>
<p>The jury concluded that Wyeth''s handling of the drug was
reckless and they had misrepresented the risks and benefits of
its drug to patients and doctors, Bubalo said. A federal judge
will decide later how much in punitive damages Pfizer must pay,
he said. </p>
<p>More than 6 million women took Prempro and related
menopause drugs to treat symptoms such as hot flashes and mood
swings before a 2002 study highlighted their links to cancer.
Wyeth''s sales of the medicines, which are still on the market,
topped $2 billion before the release of the Women''s Health
Initiative, a National Institutes of Health-sponsored study. </p>
<p>Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Premarin,
Wyeth''s estrogen-based drug, with progestin-laden Provera, made
by Pfizer''s Upjohn unit, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth
combined the two hormones in its Prempro pill. </p>
<h2>Legal Options </h2>
<p>We are disappointed with the verdict and will evaluate
our legal options once the court completes its work in this
case, Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said in an e-mailed
statement. Since the case is continuing, it would not be
appropriate to comment any further at this time. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s Wyeth and Upjohn units have now lost 11 of 20
Prempro cases decided by juries since trials began in 2006,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The New York-based drugmaker got some of those verdicts
thrown out after trial or had the awards reduced. It resolved
some of the verdicts through settlements, while other decisions
are on appeal. Pfizer also has had cases thrown out before trial
and settled others. </p>
<p>Pfizer announced in May 2011 that it had settled a third of
the pending Prempro cases and had set aside $772 million to help
resolve the claims. </p>
<p>Jurors in Fraser''s case found Wyeth officials failed to
properly warn the retired public-school principal about
Prempro''s risks, said Neal Moscow, another lawyer who
represented the plaintiff in the case. Moscow said the jury
foreperson was a lawyer for the U.S. Attorney''s Office in
Connecticut. </p>
<h2>Extreme Conduct </h2>
<p>The jury found Wyeth''s conduct was so extreme that it
warranted an award of punitive damages, the lawyer said.
Fraser, 66, is from Lakeville, Connecticut. </p>
<p>Moscow said U.S. District Judge Janet Bond Arterton in New
Haven hasn''t said when she''ll decide how much in punitive
damages Pfizer must pay in connection with the verdict. </p>
<p>In the last Prempro verdict against Pfizer and its units
five months ago, a Philadelphia jury awarded more than $72
million to three women who blamed their breast cancers on drugs
made by Wyeth and Pharmacia Upjohn. Pfizer later settled those
cases for undisclosed sums. </p>
<p>The company convinced a federal-court jury in Nebraska last
month to throw out claims that Prempro was the cause of a
woman''s breast cancer and Wyeth should be held liable for
damages. </p>
<p>The Connecticut case is Fraser v. Wyeth Inc., 3:04-1373,
U.S. District Court, District of Connecticut (New Haven). </p>

<p>Microsoft Inc. (MSFT) should sell its Bing
search business to Facebook Inc. (FB), a deal worth about $5 billion
that would help both companies compete with Google (GOOG) Inc., said
Rick Sherlund, an analyst at Nomura Equity Research. </p>
<p>If their real motivation for being in the search business
is to prevent Google from having complete market dominance,
Microsoft would be better off working with Facebook, Sherlund
said today in an interview on Bloomberg Radio''s Bloomberg
Surveillance with Tom Keene and Ken Prewitt. </p>
<p>Sherlund said Microsoft, the world''s largest software
maker, has clearly lost the battle for search market share
to Google and could boost earnings by 6 to 8 percent by
eliminating the drag of Bing, he said. Facebook would also
benefit from a partnership, Sherlund said. </p>
<p>Facebook needs to be in the search business, Sherlund
said. It''s an enormous monetization opportunity for them. </p>
<p>Microsoft already owns almost 2 percent of Facebook, making
a future agreement more likely, he said. The company would
probably get back about 80 percent of monetized search traffic
from Facebook with none of the associated costs, according to
Sherlund. </p>
<p>He estimated a $5 billion purchase price for the Bing unit,
or two times 2011 annual sales of $2.5 billion for Microsoft''s
online services division. Sherlund projected that Microsoft will
lose $2 billion from Bing this year, amounting to about a six
percentage-point impact on its operating margins. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) Chief Executive
Officer Robert Iger''s franchise-focused movie strategy will
survive the downfall of the company''s movie chief even after
John Carter lost $200 million, analysts said. </p>
<p>The world''s biggest entertainment company, Burbank,
California-based Disney has cut its film releases in half to 12
this year and targeted spending on large-budget pictures that
have the potential to be long-lived, consumer franchises. </p>
<p>The perils of betting big were underscored with the
science-fiction flop John Carter, which led to possibly the
largest loss ever on a single film. Iger spent $7 billion on
Pixar in 2006 and $4.2 billion on Marvel in 2009 to acquire
intellectual property for films, theme-park rides, toys and
other merchandise. </p>
<p>The strategy was set by Iger himself, Matt Harrigan, an
analyst with Wunderlich Securities in Denver, said in an e-mail.
He has a hold rating on Disney stock. </p>
<p>Rich Ross, who resigned as studio chairman yesterday and
presided over the release of John Carter, wasn''t a good fit
for the role, according to analysts as well as Ross''s memo to
staff, which cited a lack of passion for the job. </p>
<p>Ross faced a difficult transition to the movie business
from the Disney Channel cable network after Iger moved him to
the studio in October 2009, Harrigan said. </p>
<h2>Hollywood Newbies </h2>
<p>Ross and executives under him with little film experience
mishandled the marketing of John Carter, said Peter Sealey,
a former executive at Columbia Pictures. </p>
<p>MT Carney, the New York advertising executive who Ross
recruited to run film-studio marketing, quit in January after 20
months, ahead of the John Carter release. She directed
campaigns for hits including The Help, Cars 2 and
Pirates of the Caribbean, and also disappointments like
Secretariat and Mars Needs Moms. </p>
<p>The company hasn''t named a replacement for Ross. Those
mentioned as possible candidates by outsiders include DreamWorks
Studios co-Chairman and CEO Stacey Snider, Marvel Studios''
president of production, Kevin Feige, and Mary Parent, the
former studio head at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. </p>
<p>It''ll be someone in the industry, someone with gravitas
and credentials, Sealey said. </p>
<h2>Lagging Sales </h2>
<p>Elizabeth Kaltman, a spokeswoman for Disney''s film unit,
declined to comment on succession plans. Feige didn''t respond to
a message left at his office. Chip Sullivan, a spokesman for
DreamWorks Studios, declined to comment. Parent didn''t respond
to an e-mailed request for comment. </p>
<p>Disney ranks seventh among studios this year, with domestic
ticket sales of $186.7 million as of April 15, according to
researcher Box Office Mojo. That''s last among the major studios
and also behind Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (LGF), which has 2012''s
biggest hit so far in The Hunger Games. </p>
<p>Marvel''s The Avengers makes its debut on May 4 for
Disney, and is expected to be among the year''s top-grossing
pictures with an estimated $370 million in domestic ticket
sales, according to Phil Contrino, editor of film researcher
BoxOffice.com. The company''s next major release, Pixar''s
Brave, may take in $200 million domestically after its June
22 debut, Contrino said. </p>
<h2>Franchise Strength </h2>
<p>Disney added 0.6 percent to $42.35 yesterday in New York
trading. The shares have risen 13 percent this year. </p>
<p>Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo explained the company''s
strategy at an analyst event last year. Sequels such as Pixar''s
Toy Story 3 can generate $9 billion in retail sales, mostly
from consumer products such as games and books, far more than a
stand-alone, non-franchise picture, he said. </p>
<p>Some 80 percent of film-unit production spending went
toward franchises last year, up from 40 percent in 2010, he
said. </p>
<p>I don''t see this changing the studio strategy of focusing
on Disney and Marvel-branded stories, Alan Gould, an analyst
with New York-based Evercore Partners, said in an e-mail. He has
an overweight or buy rating on the stock. </p>
<p>As a result of John Carter, the studio will report an
operating loss of as much as $120 million for the quarter that
ended March 31, the company has said. </p>
<h2>Profit Struggle </h2>
<p>Disney releases fiscal second-quarter earnings on May 8 and
is projected to report profit of 57 cents a share, up from 49
cents in the same period last year, according to an average of
28 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Iger''s franchise-focused movie strategy has yet to
translate into enhanced profitability for the studio, said
Martin Pyykkonen, an analyst at Wedge Partners in Greenwood
Village, Colorado, who doesn''t rate the stock. </p>
<p>The film biz has really been their Achilles'' heel, he
said. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), with almost $27
billion in its existing cash hoard, will add more with the $12
billion sale of its infant nutrition unit, opening the way for
buybacks that will help shore up the shares as the company
cycles in new products over the next several years. </p>
<p>Pfizer, the world''s biggest drugmaker, will initially use
the vast majority of the money from the sale to buy back
shares, rather than pouring the money into expensive
acquisitions, said Mark Schoenebaum, a pharmaceutical industry
analyst with ISI Group Inc. in New York. </p>
<p>We don''t expect a major MA deal, Schoenebaum said in a
conference call with investors today. There''s been this
speculation that they might buy Bristol-Myers, but that''s not
going to happen in our opinion. </p>
<p>Pfizer needs new products as it enters an era without
Lipitor, the cholesterol pill that lost patent protection in
2011 after generating $9.58 billion in revenue. The New York-
based company doesn''t have a drug in its pipeline that will
replace all of Lipitor''s sales. Instead, it''s trying to fill the
hole with several products, including two under review by U.S.
regulators for possible approval this year. </p>
<p>Tofacitinib, an arthritis pill, could be worth $1.1 billion
million for Pfizer by 2017, according to John Boris, an analyst
with Citigroup in New York. Eliquis, a blood thinner developed
with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., could be worth $3 billion, though
those sales will be split. </p>
<h2>Revenue Cut </h2>
<p>Divestitures of two Pfizer units will cut revenue by about
10 percent once completed this year. Buybacks and a spinoff of
the animal-health business, expected to be announced before July
1, could cut Pfizer''s share count by as much as 15 percent and
boost earnings per share by 20 cents, Schoenebaum said. </p>
<p>Pfizer announced the $11.9 billion sale of its infant
nutrition unit to Vevey, Switzerland-based Nestle SA (NESN) today.
Pfizer shares fell less than 1 percent to $22.38 at the close in
New York. The stock has gained 3.4 percent so far this year. </p>
<p>The price of the nutrition unit was at the upper end of
expectations, said Seamus Fernandez, an analyst with Leerink
Swann  Co. in Boston who has a market perform rating on Pfizer. </p>
<p>The sale should be viewed as a positive, Fernandez said
in a note to clients today. The attractive valuation around
today''s sale will very likely be well received by investors. </p>
<p>In a statement today, Chief Executive Officer Ian Read
reiterated comments that Pfizer''s free cash would be used for
buybacks before anything else. </p>
<h2>Case to Beat'' </h2>
<p>We expect to allocate the after-tax proceeds to further
share repurchases, or invest in other business-development
opportunities, with the return on share repurchases remaining
our case to beat, Read said. </p>
<p>The company''s evolved to a phase of its corporate life
where it''s no longer rapidly growing as it did over the last
decade, said Paul Danos, dean of the Tuck School of Business at
Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. </p>
<p>Under Read, the drugmaker is shifting from quickly adding
mass to cutting fat and focusing on what it wants to do best,
Danos said in a telephone interview from Hanover. </p>
<p>There''ll come a time when you have a more elegant
organization, he said. </p>
<p>Along with cutting units, the company''s is also shrinking
expenses. Read has said he plans to cut another $1 billion from
the company''s expenses this year, specifically focusing on what
the company describes as selling, informational and
administrative costs. Severance packages for workers who are
fired are to be cut in May, as part of that plan. </p>
<h2>Animal-Health Unit </h2>
<p>Pfizer''s animal-health unit, which generated $4.18 billion
in 2011 revenue, will be spun off in an initial public offering
that may be announced before June, people familiar with the
proceedings have said. The company has hired JPMorgan Chase 
Co., Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley to handle that
deal, said one of the people. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s sale is the largest for a nutrition business of 77
deals in the last three years, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The next largest was when Bristol-Myers split off its
majority stake in Mead Johnson in 2009, leaving the food company
with a $8.94 billion market capitalization at the end of that
year. </p>
<p>The $11.9 billion cash sale to Nestle closed a contest
between the Swiss food company and Paris-based Danone (BN), which
also offered about $11 billion for the unit. Pfizer made the
decision to sell to Nestle yesterday after months of negotiating
with potential buyers, according to a person familiar with the
process. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is
offering a certificate of deposit that pays a fixed return when
two measures fall within certain ranges, the bank''s first such
offering in a market where record-low yields are driving demand. </p>
<p>The so-called range accrual 15-year CD yields 5 percent
annually when the London interbank offered rate is from 0 to 6
percent, and the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index exceeds 80 percent
of its initial value, according to a preliminary disclosure
document. New York-based Goldman started offering market-linked,
or structured, CDs in December. </p>
<p>Sales of the products in the U.S. reached a record last
year as the Federal Reserve held interest rates near zero for a
third year. The deposits, which combine debt with derivatives,
return principal at maturity and offer the opportunity for
higher gains than with typical fixed-rate CDs. </p>
<p>Tiffany Galvin, a spokeswoman for Goldman, declined to
comment. </p>
<p>Most investors will have difficulty determining whether the
5 percent on the Goldman CD is a good payout for the underlying
bet, said Michael Davis, a partner at Varick Asset Management in
New York. </p>
<p>For the near term, you''ll likely get 5 percent, but five
years from now, that might be year one of 10 years of no
coupon, Davis, who sold structured products while at Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., said in a telephone interview today. </p>
<h2>7 Percent Fee </h2>
<p>The product, which is callable, is Goldman''s first CD tied
to both rates and equities, according to a person with knowledge
of the offering who declined to be identified because terms
aren''t set. The total fee will be about 7 percent, or 4 percent
for distribution and a 3 percent hedging fee, the person said. </p>
<p>Banks sold a record 1,271 of structured CDs in the U.S.
last year, according to StructuredRetailProducts.com, a database
used by the industry. Rates on five-year, fixed-rate CDs have
fallen to 1.49 percent, the lowest level since at least June
1998, according to data from Bankrate.com. That compares with
4.4 percent in December 2007 at the start of the worst recession
since the 1930s. </p>
<p>Derivatives are contracts whose value is derived from
stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities. The London interbank
offered rate, or Libor, is the rate at which banks say they can
borrow in dollars from each other. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s largest
drug maker, is near an agreement to sell its infant-nutrition
business to Nestle SA (NESN) for about $11 billion, said people with
knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>An announcement may come as soon as today, said the people,
who declined to be identified because the matter is private.
Nestle was chosen on April 22 over Danone SA (BN), which also bid
about $11 billion, one of the people said. </p>
<p>The purchase will help Nestle, already the top seller of
infant-nutrition products, regain traction in the Chinese baby-
food market where Pfizer has a 7 percent share. Nestle has been
losing market share in the country since 2005, when it withdrew
two varieties of Neslac milk powder because authorities found
they contained excessive iodine. China accounted for about 23
percent of the 30.9 billion euro ($41 billion) market for baby-
food products in 2011, according to Euromonitor International. </p>
<p>The sale would be Pfizer''s largest divestiture since the
$16.6 billion sale of consumer health brands including Sudafed
cold medicine and Bengay pain cream to Johnson  Johnson in
2006. It is the first of two major exits that Pfizer Chief
Executive Officer Ian Read outlined to shrink the New York-based
company and concentrate its efforts on producing new drugs.
Pfizer was close to choosing between Nestle and Danone, people
knowledge of the deal said last week. </p>
<p>This deal makes huge strategic sense for Nestle, Andrew Wood, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, wrote April 18 in a
note to clients. It is in the right categories and the right
markets and with a reasonable price we would expect a fairly
positive reaction from investors. </p>
<h2>Infant Nutrition Benefits </h2>
<p>Pfizer has no comments at this time, said Trupti Wagh,
a Singapore-based spokeswoman for the company. Two calls made
outside of business hours to Nestle''s corporate media relations
line in Switzerland went unanswered. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s business includes infant formulas such as SMA and
Promil. The unit, which also makes Enercal supplements for
adults, offers products in more than 60 countries, according to
its website, and accounted for 3.2 percent of the company''s 2011
revenue. Pfizer gained the formula division through its $68
billion purchase of Wyeth in 2009. </p>
<p>Pfizer had the fifth-largest global market share of the
infant formula business in 2010, trailing Nestle, Mead-Johnson
Nutrition Co. (MJN), Danone, and Abbott Laboratories, according to Lee
Linthicum, an analyst with Euromonitor in London. Its market
positions are strongest in the Middle East and Africa, and in
the Asia-Pacific region, where Pfizer''s unit is the third- and
fourth-largest respectively, Linthicum said. </p>

<p>ACA Financial sued Goldman Sachs in New York State Supreme
Court in January 2011, accusing the company of fraudulent
inducement, fraudulent concealment and unjust enrichment in
connection with a collateralized debt obligation known as
Abacus. </p>
<p>Justice Barbara Kapnick threw out the unjust enrichment

<p>Justice Kapnick vindicated ACA''s position, and rejected

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world''s biggest computer-services provider, boosted
its stock-buyback plan by $7 billion and raised its dividend to
return cash to shareholders as earnings increase. </p>
<p>The quarterly payout will rise 10 cents to 85 cents a
share, IBM said today in a statement before a shareholder
meeting in North Charleston, South Carolina. IBM had $5.7
billion remaining from a previous buyback plan, bringing the
total available for repurchases to $12.7 billion. </p>
<p>IBM is increasing profit by focusing on higher-margin
software and services, a strategy that has allowed it to boost
payouts to shareholders each year for more than a decade. The
company''s buybacks have reduced its share count by a third since
2000, helping IBM lift its earnings per share and stock price
and winning praise from investors including Warren Buffett. </p>
<p>A key driver behind the increased share buyback and larger
dividend is that IBM''s software growth continues to grow at or
above market, Mark Moskowitz, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase 
Co. in San Francisco with an overweight rating on the stock,
said today in a note to clients. Today''s news signals no
pullback in its shareholder-friendly focus. </p>

<p>The first live question
International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) Chief Executive Officer
Virginia Ginni Rometty faced at today''s shareholder meeting
was if Georgia''s Augusta National Golf Club had admitted her as
a member. </p>
<p>IBM is one of the sponsors of the Masters Tournament, held
at Augusta National, where no woman has been offered membership
since its founding eight decades ago. Historically, the club has
offered a membership to the CEO of IBM, allowing him to don the
club''s green member blazer. </p>
<p>I''m certainly very happy about our CEO and be anxious to
know if she''s a member of Augusta? the unidentified male
shareholder asked at the meeting in North Charleston, South
Carolina. No response is required, he added. </p>
<p>Rometty, 54, didn''t answer while the room was filled with
laughter. Chairman Sam Palmisano, standing next to her on the
stage, thanked the shareholder for the very kind comment. </p>
<p>We were all curious as to when that would come up,
Palmisano said. But thank you again. Can I have another
question please? </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank by assets, named Jeff Urwin chief executive officer of
Asia Pacific, replacing Gaby Abdelnour, who is leaving the firm. </p>
<p>Urwin, 56, will add the role to his duties as head of
global investment banking coverage, the New York-based firm said
in a statement today. He will move to Hong Kong from New York in
May and report to Jes Staley, CEO of the investment bank.
Abdelnour told JPMorgan last month he planned to step down this
summer to pursue personal interests, according to a March memo. </p>
<p>Basing our global head of investment banking in Asia
Pacific further cements our ongoing commitment to the region and
its importance, Staley said in the statement. This is the
first time JPMorgan''s global head of investment banking will be
based in Asia Pacific, the company said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the third-ranked adviser on mergers globally this
year, is second in the Asia-Pacific region after Morgan Stanley,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The firm has advised on
$24.1 billion of deals in the region this year, including Hong
Kong-based Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.''s 1.3 billion-euro ($1.7
billion) purchase of Orange Austria in February. </p>
<p>Abdelnour was tapped to run the firm''s Asia-Pacific unit in
July 2006. Under his leadership, JPMorgan set up a securities
joint venture in China, bought a stake in a trust and a
guarantee company, and established a locally incorporated bank. </p>
<p>Urwin joined JPMorgan from Bear Stearns Cos. in 2008, where
he was co-head of global investment banking. He also worked at
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) increased its
quarterly distribution to shareholders by 21 percent as oil
prices remain above $100 a barrel, making the energy company the
world''s biggest dividend payer. </p>
<p>Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, boosted its quarterly
dividend to 57 cents a share from 47 cents, according to a
statement yesterday. That means the company will pay $10.7
billion a year to shareholders, more than any other corporation,
according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at
Standard  Poor''s. </p>
<p>Exxon Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson told analysts
at a meeting last month the company would listen to shareholders
as it evaluated the payout. The company now is set to pay an
annual dividend of $2.28 a share for a yield of 2.6 percent,
less than Chevron Corp. (CVX)''s 3.5 percent. Brent crude prices, a
benchmark in much of the world, climbed 12 percent in the first
quarter from a year earlier to average $118.45. </p>
<p>Exxon''s annual spending on dividends is set to surpass such
companies as ATT Inc. (T), Apple Inc. (AAPL) and General Electric Co. (GE),
according to Silverblatt. </p>
<p>I think they''re realizing that we''re in a higher oil-
price environment going forward, said Brian Youngberg, an
analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis who has a hold rating
on Exxon shares and doesn''t own any. The feedback they''ve been
getting is that the company needs to have a more competitive
dividend yield to attract more investors. </p>
<p>Chevron raised its quarterly dividend 11 percent to 90
cents a share from 81 cents, according to a statement yesterday.
That gives Chevron a potential annual dividend of $3.60 a share. </p>
<p>Youngberg said Exxon has relied on stock buybacks to boost
shareholder value, while he''d like to see the company raise the
dividend further. </p>
<p>Dividends allow the investor to decide how to reinvest
the cash, he said in an interview yesterday. </p>
<p>Exxon rose 0.6 percent to $86.85 at the close yesterday in
New York. </p>

<p>General Dynamics Corp. (GD) and Northrop
Grumman Corp. (NOC) are working to cut costs and improve productivity
to compensate for declining defense sales, the companies said in
reporting first-quarter results. </p>
<p>Defense orders are slowing, particularly for information-
technology services, as the Pentagon seeks cuts of $490 billion
over a decade, with the potential of $500 billion more if
automatic reductions take effect in January, Jay Johnson,
chairman and chief executive officer of General Dynamics, said
today. </p>
<p>Anxiety over these issues will almost certainly escalate
as we move into the summer months and election campaigns roll
into high gear, Johnson said on a conference call with
analysts. </p>
<p>Net income at General Dynamics declined to $564 million, or
$1.57 a share, in the first quarter from $618 million, or $1.64
a share, a year earlier, the maker of Abrams battle tanks and
Gulfstream jets, said today in a statement. </p>
<p>After adjusting for a non-cash charge of 13 cents a share,
profit was $1.70 a share compared with the average estimate of
$1.69 a share by 20 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales
declined 2.8 percent to $7.58 billion. </p>
<p>In the first quarter, Northrop''s net income from continuing
operations was $506 million, or $1.96 a share, compared with
$496 million, or $1.67 a year earlier, the company said today in
a statement. The average estimate of 19 analysts compiled by
Bloomberg was $1.59 a share. Sales declined 8 percent to $6.2
billion. </p>
<h2>Northrop''s Forecast </h2>
<p>Northrop boosted its 2012 profit forecast today to $6.70 to
$6.95 a share, compared with its prediction in January of $6.40
to $6.70 a share. General Dynamics reaffirmed its profit
projection of $7.10 to $7.20 a share made in January. </p>
<p>Northrop rose 28 cents to $63.01 at the close of trading in
New York. General Dynamics fell $2.50, or 3.6 percent, to
$67.56, the biggest decline since Nov. 23. Both are based in
Falls Church, Virginia. </p>
<p>Defense sales growth will continue to be elusive for the
companies, according to Joel Levington, a bond analyst at
Brookfield Investment Management Inc. in New York </p>
<p>Both companies experienced that this quarter and will
likely for years to come, Levington said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>All four of Northrop''s business units reported better
margins in the quarter than a year earlier. Wes Bush, the
chairman and chief executive officer, attributed that to cost-
cutting and productivity gains. </p>
<h2>Gulfstream Jets </h2>
<p>A 20 percent increase in sales and an 18 percent rise in
profit at General Dynamics'' Gulfstream jet business was offset
by a one-time charge at its Combat Systems unit as operating
income declined. </p>
<p>Demand for Gulfstream jets was healthy in the quarter
with particularly strong interest from North American
customers, General Dynamics said in the statement. </p>
<p>The aerospace unit, which makes the business jets, had a
funded backlog of $16.7 billion at the end of the first quarter,
the company said. </p>
<p>The threat of automatic federal budget cuts, known as
sequestration, is slowing orders for General Dynamics'' military
radios, satellites, and information-technology systems, Johnson
said. </p>
<p>Revenue at the Combat Systems unit, maker of Abrams tanks
and Stryker vehicles, fell 2.3 percent to $1.91 billion and unit
income declined 27 percent to $203 million, the company said. </p>
<p>General Dynamics said the European operations of its Combat
Systems unit had a $67 million non-cash charge during the first
quarter. </p>
<p>Sales at the Marine Systems unit, maker of the Navy''s
destroyers and nuclear-powered submarines, fell 4.2 percent to
$1.61 billion and profit gained 11 percent to $185 million. </p>
<p>Information Systems and Technology sales fell 13.3 percent
to $2.44 billion and profit declined 21 percent to $218 million,
the company said. </p>
<h2>Northrop''s Drones </h2>
<p>Northrop faces challenges from proposed cuts in the
Pentagon''s fiscal 2013 budget that would affect the company''s
top-selling programs, including the Global Hawk drone and the
F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, on which it is a subcontractor to
planemaker Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) </p>
<p>The Pentagon proposed in its 2013 budget saving $800
million by reducing purchases of the Global Hawk Block 30 model.
The Defense Department would also gain $1.6 billion from the
F-35 program by eliminating 13 planes. </p>
<p>Bush has said he is focused on increasing profit margins
and returning cash to shareholders. He has raised dividends for
eight consecutive years. In 2011, Northrop paid out about $2.8
billion as dividends and share repurchases. </p>
<h2>Cybersecurity, Sensors </h2>
<p>While Northrop''s business in cybersecurity, unmanned
systems, intelligence, sensors and reconnaissance systems and
logistics are well-aligned with Pentagon''s priorities, we do
not expect much growth in these areas over the next several
years, given the budget situation, Douglas Harned, an analyst
at Sanford C. Bernstein LLC in New York, wrote in an April 23
note to clients. He rates the stock market-perform. </p>
<p>Performance improvements at the company''s Electronic and
Information Systems units contributed to an increase in
operating income and profit during the quarter even as sales
fell, Northrop said in the statement. </p>
<p>Sales at Electronic Systems, the maker of radar equipment,
fell 4.6 percent to $1.72 billion, while profit rose 28 percent
to $304 million, the company said. </p>
<p>Information Systems sales fell 9 percent to $1.84 billion
whereas profit increased 5.6 percent to $205 million, the
company said. </p>
<p>Sales and profit at the Aerospace unit, maker of Global
Hawks, fell, according to the company. Revenue declined 8
percent to $2.38 billion and profit fell 2.7 percent to $279
million. </p>

<p>An experimental drug for depression
being developed by Pfizer Inc. (PFE) reduced signs of autism in mice
in a study, a finding that may shed light on the cause of the
disorder and jump-start research into ways to treat it. </p>
<p>The treatment, named GRN-529, targets the brain chemical
glutamate, tied to socialization and behavior. When given to
mice displaying signs of autism, it suppressed repetitive
actions and anti-social behavior, according to the research
published today in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Pfizer and the National Institutes of Health funded the study. </p>
<p>There are no drugs on the market to treat the symptoms or
causes of autism. Until recently, scientists believed the brains
of autistic patients were hard-wired before diagnosis, making
treatment with a drug difficult, said Daniel Smith, an autism
researcher at Pfizer. That changed with findings the disorder
may be caused by malfunctioning genes that have a real-time
effect on the brain, said Smith, a co-author of the study. </p>
<p>It is only in the past five years that there have been
large human studies identifying the genetic mutations linked to
autism, Smith said in a telephone interview. From that we
can now explore those genetic pathways in more detail. </p>
<p>Pfizer shares rose 1.5 percent to $22.96 in New York time.
The stock has gained 14 percent in the past 12 months. </p>
<p>In the latest research, mice that were given the Pfizer
drug displayed less repetitive grooming and jumping, and spent
more time interacting with other animals. </p>
<p>Autism, a disorder that may affect one in 88 U.S. children,
hurts brain development and is linked to poor social interaction
and communication skills, repeated body movements, and unusual
attachments to objects. </p>
<p>Pfizer, based in New York, plans to continue studying the
drug in animals, Smith said. </p>
<p>Novartis AG and Roche Holding AG (ROG), both based in Basel,
Switzerland, and the closely held U.S. company Seaside
Therapeutics LLC are testing similar medicines in humans with
fragile X syndrome, a genetic condition characterized by mental
retardation, behavior problems, and delayed speech. </p>
<p>About 30 percent of patients with fragile X meet the
diagnostics criteria for autism, the study said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chairman

<p>I tend to be a little more positive than what I''m hearing
from other people, Blankfein, 57, told Bloomberg Television

headquarters. One of the big risks that people have to

<p>Blankfein, chairman and CEO since June 2006, warned about
the potential for a credit crisis during a June 2007 conference,
15 months before the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
In November, he said he expected markets to snap back. The
Standard  Poor''s 500 Index rose 12 percent in the first three
months of this year, the most since the third quarter of 2009. </p>
<p>While profit at Goldman Sachs improved from the end of
2011, the fifth-biggest bank by assets reported last week that
first-quarter net income fell 23 percent from a year earlier as
revenue from trading bonds, currencies and commodities lagged
behind rivals JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Citigroup Inc. (C) </p>
<p>Blankfein said his bank''s 12.2 percent return on equity in
the first quarter was a reflection of muted economic growth and
client demand, which he called a lower third-quartile
opportunity set. He said that investors shouldn''t extrapolate
the firm''s long-term prospects from those results. </p>

<p>General Dynamics Corp. (GD) said first-
quarter profit fell 8.7 percent, because of a decline in sales
and profit at its combat systems unit. </p>
<p>Net income declined $564 million, or $1.57 a share, from
$618 million, or $1.64 a share, a year earlier, the maker of
Abrams battle tanks and Gulfstream jets, said today in a
statement. General Dynamics fell 1.2 percent to $69.19 at 10:04
a.m. in New York trading. </p>
<p>After adjusting for a non-cash charge of 13 cents a share,
profit was $1.70 compared with the average estimate of $1.69 a
share by 20 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales declined 2.8
percent to $7.58 billion. </p>
<p>Jay Johnson, the company''s chairman and chief executive
officer, sees international and domestic demand for Gulfstream
jets offsetting weak orders for some of the company''s defense
products this year. </p>
<p>The Gulfstream G650, a large-cabin, long-range business jet
that''s in development, already has a backlog of more than 200
orders and it''s a very, very well-received airplane before it
ever even hits the market, Johnson has said. </p>
<h2>Defense Cuts </h2>
<p>The company''s first quarter result reflects continued
growth in our aerospace segment as well as the challenges
presented by slow defense orders, Johnson said in the
statement today. </p>
<p>The threat of automatic defense budget cuts, known as
sequestration, is slowing orders for General Dynamics'' military
radios, satellites, and information-technology systems, Johnson
said Feb. 23. </p>
<p>General Dynamics, based in Falls Church, Virginia, said the
European operations of its Combat Systems unit had a $67 million
non-cash charge during the first quarter. The company reaffirmed
today its forecast for 2012 profit of $7.10 to $7.20 a share
made in January, less than the $7.33 a share estimate of 22
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>General Dynamics rose 79 cents or 1.14 percent to $70.06
yesterday in New York trading. They have gained 5.5 percent
before today. </p>
<p>Sales at the company''s Aerospace unit, maker of Gulfstream
jets, rose 20 percent to $1.62 billion, and profit gained 18
percent to $271 million, the company said. </p>
<h2>Gulfstream Demand </h2>
<p>Demand for Gulfstream jets was healthy in the quarter
with particularly strong interest from North American
customers, General Dynamics said in the statement. </p>
<p>The Aerospace unit had a funded backlog of $16.7 billion at
the end of the first quarter, the company said. </p>
<p>In its defense business, the company''s high exposure to
Army spend is a concern, Douglas Harned, an analyst at Sanford
C. Bernstein LLC in New York, wrote in an April 23 note to
clients. In addition to the Abrams tanks, the company makes
Stryker combat vehicles for the U.S. Army. Harned rates the
stock market-perform. </p>
<p>The Pentagon plans to cut about $490 billion from its
planned spending over the next 10 years under budget-reduction
legislation, with an additional $500 billion if the automatic
cuts take effect starting in January. </p>
<p>Revenue at the Combat Systems unit, maker of Abrams and
Stryker vehicles, fell 2.3 percent to $1.91 billion and unit
income declined 27 percent to $203 million, the company said. </p>
<p>Sales at the Marine Systems unit, maker of the Navy''s

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS)''s fixed-income
trading unit will struggle if Moody''s Investors Service follows
through with a potential three-level downgrade, according to
Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. </p>
<p>Such a reduction may slice 30 percent off revenue from
fixed-income derivatives, which account for 15 percent of total
fixed-income revenue, Hintz estimated in a research note
yesterday. Equity-derivatives revenue, which is about 20 percent
of total equities revenue, could fall 10 percent, according to
the note. Based on 2011 trading results, those declines would
mean losing about $400 million of annual trading revenue. </p>
<p>Equity investors should assume this potential downgrade
is likely to occur, wrote Hintz, a former Morgan Stanley
treasurer. The potential downgrade makes it more difficult for
MS''s fixed-income business to sustainably outperform, he
added, referring to the New York-based firm by its stock symbol. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley faces the largest credit downgrade among
U.S. lenders by Moody''s, which will take ratings actions on the
largest global investment banks by the end of June. Morgan
Stanley''s rating may drop to Baa2, two levels above junk, from
A2. That could force the firm to post more collateral on
derivatives trades and pay more to borrow. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer James Gorman and Chief Financial
Officer Ruth Porat said last week that they''ve taken steps to
ensure any fallout from a downgrade would be manageable. </p>
<h2>Risk Management </h2>
<p>MS claims they have numerous alternatives to offset
this, Hintz wrote. But Bernstein is skeptical. Mark Lake,
a spokesman for Morgan Stanley, declined to comment. </p>
<p>The bank''s ability to execute trades through its triple-A
rated subsidiary will be limited by onerous hedging and risk-
management rules and collateral charges that make its use
problematic, Hintz wrote. This subsidiary''s complex
structure did not economically work in the 1990s when it was set
up and it probably won''t work economically today. </p>
<p>Hintz continues to rate Morgan Stanley outperform, the
same rating he''s had on the stock since August 2007, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Moody''s cited new challenges for the industry such as
increased regulation and fragile funding conditions when it
announced the review of 17 firms with capital markets operations
in February. It also noted inherent vulnerabilities such as
the dependence on confidence in the markets and a lack of
transparency on risks. </p>
<h2>BlackRock''s View </h2>
<p>BlackRock Inc. (BLK), the world''s biggest asset manager, said
last week that it may be forced to reduce business with some
banks if their credit ratings are lowered. </p>
<p>I don''t think there''s any possibility we''re not going to
be doing business with BlackRock, Gorman said later in the
week in an interview on Bloomberg Television. It''s only
certain individual contracts and we''ve created a number of
workaround situations where we can deal with this. </p>
<p>Analysts including Edward Jones  Co.''s Shannon Stemm have
said they don''t expect the Moody''s downgrade would have a
meaningful impact on Morgan Stanley''s trading business. </p>
<p>Clients not bound by technical requirements, if they had
concerns around facing off with Morgan Stanley as a
counterparty, would already have reduced or currently be moving
to reduce exposures, Roger Freeman, an analyst at Barclays
Plc''s investment bank, wrote in an April 20 report. Judging
from 1Q results, however, market share within FICC appears to be
accruing to Morgan Stanley, not heading in the other
direction. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world''s
largest energy company by market value, said net income fell 11
percent as its biggest first-quarter production decline since
2008 wiped out most of the benefit of record oil prices. </p>
<p>First-quarter profit was $9.45 billion, or $2 a share,
compared with $10.65 billion, or $2.14 a year earlier, the
Irving, Texas-based company said in a statement today. Exxon was
expected to report per-share net income of $2.08, based on the
average of 16 analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson has been
looking for new projects to reverse production declines that
reached 5.5 percent during the first three months of this year,
the third straight quarter of shortfalls, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Lower output was driven by natural field
declines and the impact of higher prices on production-sharing
agreements. </p>
<p>The company''s oil output fell by 7.7 percent during the
quarter while production of U.S. natural gas that is fetching
the lowest prices in a decade rose 0.7 percent. </p>
<p>The production growth slackening is a concern, Allen Good, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. (MORN) in Chicago, said today in a
telephone interview. But they should have some projects coming
online in the next couple of years that will add crude
production so hopefully they will reverse some of these
declines. </p>
<h2>New Production </h2>
<p>Production from the Kearl oil-sands project in Canada and
Angolan and Nigerian developments, which are expected to begin
operations this year, are key to meeting the company''s 2012
volume outlook, David Rosenthal, Exxon''s vice president of
investor relations, said on a conference call today. </p>
<p>Exxon expects full-year volume performance to be consistent
with its March outlook, he said. The company has estimated that
output would fall 3 percent this year. </p>
<p>Sales rose 8.8 percent to $124 billion. Exxon fell 0.9
percent to $86.07 at the close in New York. The shares have
risen 1.6 percent this year. </p>
<p>Exxon became the world''s biggest dividend payer yesterday
when it boosted its quarterly distribution by 21 percent to 57
cents a share. </p>
<p>The increase brings the company''s annual payout to
shareholders to $2.28 a share, or $10.7 billion, more than ATT
Inc. (T), Apple Inc. (AAPL) and General Electric Co. (GE), according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at Standard  Poor''s. </p>
<h2>Dividend Increase </h2>
<p>The 21 percent increase is obviously very large, but we
think there''s more to come, Jason Gammel, an analyst at
Macquarie Capital Ltd., said today during an interview with
Maryam Nemazee on Bloomberg Television''s The Pulse.
Another 20 percent next year is certainly achievable. </p>
<p>Exxon plans to purchase about $5 billion of its shares in
the second quarter, unchanged from the first quarter, Rosenthal
said during the call. </p>
<p>U.S. gas fell 40 percent during the quarter to an average
of $2.503 per million British thermal units as new wells in
shale formations glutted domestic markets and demand slumped
during a mild winter. The fuel reached a 10-year low of $1.902
on April 19 before rising to $2.068 yesterday. </p>
<p>The company is moving rigs to projects focused on petroleum
liquids, such as the Bakken Shale and Permian Basin, Rosenthal
said. </p>
<p>Exxon is continuing to acquire liquids-rich acreage at
attractive prices and shift our rig fleet over to those areas,
while minimizing the incremental exposure to dry gas wells, he
said. </p>
<p>Brent crude futures, the benchmark for two-thirds of the
world''s oil, averaged $118.45 a barrel, a record for the first
quarter and a 12 percent increase from a year earlier. Exxon''s
production was 51 percent oil and 49 percent gas last year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) is likely to divest its
animal health unit through a combination of an initial public
offering and an exchange of shares with current stockholders,
Chief Executive Officer Ian Read said. </p>
<p>We''re probably going to exchange, part of it will be sold
for stock in the open market, part of it will be swapped for
Pfizer shares, Read said today at the company''s annual
investor meeting in Morristown, New Jersey. He said that no
final decision has been made on how to shed the business. </p>
<p>Pfizer, the world''s biggest drugmaker, is divesting the
animal health unit, with $4.18 billion in revenue last year, as
part of Read''s plan to focus the New York-based company on
developing new drugs. On April 23, the company announced an
agreement to sell its infant nutrition business to Vevey,
Switzerland-based Nestle SA (NESN) for $11.9 billion. </p>
<p>A public offering of as much as 20 percent of the value of
the animal health business would let Pfizer take cash from the
unit without triggering a large tax penalty, said Erik Gordon, a
business professor at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.
The company could then exchange Pfizer stock for shares in the
new animal health company. </p>
<h2>Reducing Shares </h2>
<p>That reduces the Pfizer share count, and that helps
Pfizer on EPS and dividend coverage, Gordon said in an e-mail.
Read has said share buybacks are the first priority for using
the company''s spare cash. A share exchange would achieve a
similar result in cutting the amount of stock outstanding. </p>
<p>Pfizer gained less than 1 percent to $23.06 at the close in
New York. </p>
<p>Joan Campion, a spokeswoman for Pfizer, declined to provide
more details on the exact timing of a transaction, only saying
that the company plans to make an announcement this year and
complete any change by July 2013. </p>
<p>Pfizer needs new products as it enters an era without
Lipitor, the cholesterol pill that lost patent protection in
2011 after generating $9.58 billion in revenue. The company
doesn''t have a medicine in its pipeline that will replace all of
Lipitor''s sales by itself. Instead, Pfizer is trying to fill the
hole with several products, including two under review by U.S.
regulators for possible approval this year. </p>
<p>Along with cutting units, Pfizer is shrinking expenses.
Read has said he plans to eliminate another $1 billion from the
company''s costs this year, focusing on what the drugmaker
describes as selling, informational and administrative costs.
Severance packages for workers who are fired are to be cut in
May, as part of that plan. </p>
<p>The drugmaker is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings
on May 1. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS)''s Marvel''s The
Avengers broke opening-day records in four overseas markets,
an indication the studio has a hit. </p>
<p>The super-hero film featuring Robert Downey Jr. and
Scarlett Johannson opened in 10 markets yesterday. It had record
first-day grosses in New Zealand and Taiwan, and set new marks
for a Disney release in Australia and Italy, the Burbank,
California-based company said today in a statement. The
Avengers took in a total of $17.1 million internationally,
Disney said. The movie opens May 4 in the U.S. </p>
<p>Disney would welcome a hit after announcing last month that
it will take a $200 million write-down on the March science
fiction release John Carter. Film studio Chairman Rich Ross
resigned on April 20. A successor wasn''t named. The studio
expects to post a quarterly loss of as much as $120 million as a
result of the flop. </p>
<p>Foreign markets represent a growing share of ticket sales
for U.S. studios, according to the Washington-based Motion
Picture Association of America. Worldwide box office sales rose
3.2 percent to $32.6 billion last year, while the U.S. and
Canadian portion fell 3.8 percent to $10.2 billion, the trade
group said last month. </p>
<p>Movietickets.com, which sells tickets in advance for U.S.
theaters, said it is selling more admissions to The Avengers
than all previous releases from Disney''s Marvel unit, including
Iron Man 2. That film grossed $623 million worldwide in
2010, according to Box Office Mojo. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
fifth-largest U.S. bank, expanded its management team for Brazil
investment banking, naming Daniel Wainstein chairman and adding
two co-chief operating officers. </p>
<p>Antonio Pereira and Fabio Bicudo, previously managing
directors at the New York-based company, were named co-COOs and
Wainstein, 42, who was head of the Brazil investment bank, will
become chairman effective immediately, Stephen Scherr, Goldman
Sachs''s chief for Latin America and global head of the
investment bank''s financing group, said in an interview. </p>
<p>We have been expanding the team, and we need Daniel to
have more client engagement, Scherr said, adding that Goldman
Sachs has doubled the number of employees as revenue increased
from the business in the past three years. Goldman Sachs has
about 300 people in Brazil, Scherr said. </p>
<p>Pereira and Bicudo will assist Daniel in the day-to-day
management tasks, freeing him up to develop client
relationships, Scherr said. </p>
<p>The firm, which doesn''t disclose Brazil revenue or profit,
last month named Paulo Leme as chairman for the country. The
firm has said its strategy in Brazil is to focus on complex
products with higher profit margins, such as convertible debt
and receivables securitization. </p>
<p>U.S. and international banks are competing against Brazil-
based companies such as Banco Itau BBA SA and Banco BTG Pactual
SA, which have used their stronger local contacts to squeeze out
foreign firms. </p>
<h2>Merger Advisers </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs didn''t make the top 10 in any Brazil
investment-banking category in 2009 or 2010, excluding
international bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The firm was No. 8 among Brazil merger advisers last year, with
$14.8 billion in deals, and ranks 10th this year for MA, with
two deals totaling $2.62 billion. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs completed its strategy to become a full-
service bank in Brazil in 2009, after two failed attempts to buy
local firms. In 1998, Goldman Sachs tried to buy Banco de
Investimentos Garantia SA, which was acquired by Credit Suisse
Group AG. </p>
<p>Seven years later it sought to purchase Banco Pactual SA,
an investment bank later acquired by UBS AG. Pactual was sold
back to BTG Partners in 2009 and is now Banco BTG Pactual SA.
BTG went public this week in a $1.94 billion initial offering
that Goldman Sachs helped underwrite. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. energy company, missed first-quarter profit and sales
estimates as falling production blunted the impact of surging
oil prices. </p>
<p>Excluding a gain from the sale of a Spanish fuels-marketing
business, per-share profit was 11 cents less than the average of
16 analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Net income rose
4.2 percent to $6.47 billion, or $3.27 a share, from $6.21
billion, or $3.09, a year earlier, the San Ramon, California-
based company said in a statement today. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer John S. Watson has been contending
with the downside of higher oil prices: a decline in output as
some project contracts reduce the company''s share of production
when global crude rises. The company said the higher price it
receives for oil more than makes up for the decrease in its
share. </p>
<p>Chevron gains $40 of earnings for every dollar lost to
price effects, Jeanette Ourada, general manager of investor
relations, said on a conference call with analysts today. </p>
<p>Natural-gas output also declined in the U.S. as the lowest
prices in a decade discouraged drilling. </p>
<h2>Gas Production Curtailments </h2>
<p>We are seeing the mothballing of some conventional
natural-gas production at these low price levels, said Robbert Van Batenburg, head of research at Louis Capital Markets LP in
New York. They can''t really fight that. </p>
<p>Chevron pumped the equivalent of 2.63 million barrels of
crude a day during the quarter, a 4.7 percent drop from 2.76
million produced a year earlier, according to the statement.
Sales rose 0.8 percent to $58.9 billion, 7.8 percent less than
the average of three analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Chevron fell 2 cents to $106.20 at the close in New York.
The shares have dropped 0.2 percent this year. </p>
<p>U.S. gas output dropped by 7.9 percent to 1.17 billion
cubic feet a day. Crude production in the U.S. declined by 5.4
percent and fell by 6.3 percent internationally, the company
said. </p>
<p>Brent crude futures, which serve as the benchmark for two-
thirds of the world''s crude, jumped 12 percent to average
$118.45 a barrel during the quarter. Every $1 increase in the
price of oil reduces the company''s production volume by 1,000
barrels a day, Watson told analysts and investors in New York on
March 13. </p>
<h2>Neutral Effect </h2>
<p>The earnings will have a neutral effect on Chevron''s stock,
Barclay''s analyst Paul Cheng wrote in a note to clients. The
market will focus on stronger-than-expected results in its
exploration and production segment, Cheng wrote in the note,
pointing to the company''s higher per-barrel profit. </p>
<p>Chevron saw profit equivalent to $25.80 per barrel, Cheng
said, up from $24.10 in the year-earlier period and above
Barclay''s estimate of $25.30. Cheng rates Chevron''s stock as
overweight, which means investors should buy. </p>
<p>Chevron said on April 10 that it recorded a $200 million
gain during the quarter from the sale of Spanish assets. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) reported $9.45 billion in first-quarter
profit yesterday, an 11 percent decline from a year earlier. The
Irving, Texas-based company is the largest U.S. energy producer
by market value. </p>

<p>J. Michael Evans, vice chairman at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), who oversees the firm''s business in
emerging markets, last night paid $22,000 for Eric Ripert to
cook in his home. </p>
<p>At the Children''s Storefront auction, he also bid a winning
$13,000 for brunch at the Red Rooster, honoree Marcus Samuelsson''s restaurant. </p>
<p>(The Ripert price was a comparative bargain: at an April 24
benefit, an unidentified member of the City Harvest board had
paid $200,000 for the same privilege.) </p>
<p>In a week when Goldman Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein told CNBC that the board has a successor in mind and
hasn''t told that person yet, Evans, sometimes named as a leading
candidate for the job, asserted himself on behalf of two New
York charities. </p>
<p>At his side was his tall blonde Norwegian wife, Lise Evans,
one night wearing St. John, the other Lanvin. </p>
<p>The Lanvin, a pink and red cocktail dress, came out for A
Night for Changing Lives, the Children''s Storefront benefit at
the IAC Building, where Michael, 54, and Lise, 44, were event
chairmen (and Michael wore a business suit and a tie with a
whale pattern). </p>
<p>The tuition-free independent school, located in four
brownstones on East 129th Street in Harlem, teaches 174 students
in pre-kindergarten through the eighth grade. </p>
<h2>Education Master </h2>
<p>Lise first served the school as a student teacher while
earning a master''s degree in English education at Columbia
University''s Teachers College. A board member for seven years,
she will be installed as board chairwoman in July. </p>
<p>Two days earlier Michael and Lise were co-chairmen with
seven other couples, including Heather and Steve Mnuchin, of
An Evening of Practical Magic, the City Harvest benefit at
Cipriani 42nd Street. There the couple sat with Credit Suisse''s
Bob Jain, Goldman colleague Henry Cornell, the writer Jay McInerney and Ripert, chef at Le Bernardin. </p>
<p>Michael joined the board of City Harvest last year, having
learned about it from Ripert, a City Harvest board member, at
whose restaurant he is a frequent customer. One of his favorite
dishes is the thinly pounded yellow fin tuna served with foie
gras. </p>
<p>Not too much, not too little, light and beautiful,
Michael said of the dish. </p>
<p>It was not a question of convincing or recruiting Michael
to the board, Ripert said. He wanted to do it. </p>
<h2>Stephens Praised </h2>
<p>City Harvest fits the things that Lise and I are
interested in, Michael said, praising the organization''s
executive director, Jilly Stephens. Ask yourself this: Who
writes anything negative about City Harvest? It''s one of the
most efficient ecosystems for the redistribution of food. </p>
<p>An Olympic gold medalist for the Canadian rowing team in
1984, Michael has been described by his former Princeton
University teammate John Seabrook as super, super
competitive. </p>
<p>He said he still rows a single on occasion in Southampton. </p>
<p>Lise, for her part, grew up a skier. Now she likes to kick
box. Her goal as chairwoman, she said, is to expand
collaborations with Harlem Children''s Zone, the Studio Museum in
Harlem and other institutions in the neighborhood. </p>
<h2>Richter, Kennedy </h2>
<p>Also this week: Jim Berk, CEO of Participant Media, joined
the lead singer of Train, Pat Monahan, former New York Ranger
Mike Richter and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to support Riverkeeper.
Susan Sarandon and Padma Lakshmi also attended. </p>
<p>Berk said the documentary about hunger by chef and Craft
restaurateur Tom Colicchio and filmmaker Lori Silverbush will be
released in early 2013. </p>
<p>Sir John Soane''s Museum in London held a benefit at 583
Park where art dealer Angela Westwater chatted with the Met
Museum Greek and Roman art curator Carlos A. Picon. In the same
venue, Mario Cuomo gave a tribute to his wife, Matilda Cuomo, on
behalf of the SLE Lupus Foundation, which increased the revenue
at its Bag Ladies Luncheon to $250,000 from $183,000. </p>
<p>Venetian Heritage lured its supporters with Tilda Swinton
and Richard Gere. And at the Whitney Museum of American Art,
choreographer Sarah Michelson received the Bucksbaum Award, a
$100,000 grant bestowed on an artist in the biennial, named
after and endowed by Melva Bucksbaum, a museum trustee.
Michelson, the second female to receive the award in 12 years,
will also get her own exhibition at the Whitney. </p>

<p>-- JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) said a Federal
Reserve proposal to cut risk by capping a bank''s dealings with
any one lender, corporation or foreign government fails to
strike the correct balance and may harm financial markets. </p>
<p>The plan could destabilize markets, Barry Zubrow,
executive vice president of corporate and regulatory affairs for
JPMorgan, said yesterday in a comment letter to the central
bank. The Fed is reaching well beyond the Dodd-Frank reform
legislation with disruptive standards that duplicate or
conflict with other rules and directives, he wrote. </p>
<p>Lenders including New York-based JPMorgan, the largest and
most profitable U.S. bank, are resisting Fed efforts to impose
tougher standards on too-big-to-fail firms whose collapse could
hurt the broader economy. Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo will meet
tomorrow with chief executive officers of the biggest banks
including JPMorgan''s Jamie Dimon to discuss the limits and
complaints about this year''s stress tests. </p>
<p>The proposal to limit credit exposure is designed to
contain the damage if a large company, foreign government or
bank should fail and threaten to take down other institutions
with it. Under the rule, a firm deemed systemically important
couldn''t have more than 10 percent of its counterparty risk tied
to one entity. The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act proposed a 25 percent cap
while giving the Fed authority to tighten the standard to ensure
stability in financial markets. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Co. (KO) said it isn''t in
discussions to buy Monster Beverage Corp. (MNST) after the Wall Street
Journal reported the companies were in talks. Monster fell after
posting the biggest intraday gain in almost eight years. </p>
<p>Monster dropped 0.8 percent to $65 in New York after
climbing as much as 28 percent, its biggest intraday gain since
May 7, 2004. The Corona, California-based company still has
risen 41 percent this year. </p>
<p>At this time, we are not in discussions to acquire the
Monster Beverage Corporation, Atlanta-based Coca-Cola, which
has a distribution deal with Monster, said in a statement today.
We continue to review the best ways to maximize the value of
our relationship. </p>
<p>Monster shopped itself to Coca-Cola and PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) a year
ago, and both beverage companies passed on an acquisition,
citing the cost of a deal, said a person familiar with the
matter. A few months ago, Coca-Cola and Monster spoke again
about a deal, said the person, who asked not to be named because
the talks were private. Coca-Cola again decided Monster was too
expensive and pressed to start talks about an expanded
partnership that could lead to a small stake sale to Coca-Cola,
said the person. </p>
<p>The Journal, citing unidentified people familiar with the
situation, reported today that Coca-Cola was in talks to buy
Monster and may sell some of its bottling assets to pay for the
company. Monster trades at more than 30 times estimated 2012
earnings, and Coca-Cola may not want to pay a large premium for
the beverage-maker because the two companies already have a
distribution deal, the Journal reported. </p>
<h2>Monster Distribution </h2>
<p>Coca-Cola already distributes almost half of Monster''s U.S.
volume. Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI) distributes roughly the same
amount with a few small distributors making up the balance. </p>
<p>Judy Lin Sfetcu, a spokeswoman for Monster, declined to
comment. Peter Land, a PepsiCo spokesman, declined to comment.
Kent Landers, a spokesman for Coca-Cola, said the company had no
comment beyond the statement. </p>
<p>As of the April 27 close, Monster had a market
capitalization of about $11 billion. At that price it would be
Coca-Cola''s second-biggest deal after its $12.2 billion
acquisition of the North American operations of bottler Coca-
Cola Enterprises Inc. in 2010, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Monster, which got its start selling juices in the 1930s,
had the highest operating margins in the industry as of March
and was projected to boost earnings 70 percent in the next three
years, analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg showed. U.S.
alternative-beverage sales reached almost $32 billion last year,
according to estimates by the Beverage Marketing Corp. </p>
<h2>Energy Drinks </h2>
<p>Monster Beverage, formerly known as Hansen Natural Corp.,
sold juices and sodas under the Hansen name before introducing
the first Monster Energy products in 2002 to capture growing
demand for drinks made with added caffeine or supplements to
deliver an energy boost. Monster brands, ranging from coffee-
based Java Monster to its Nitrous drink injected with nitrous
oxide, now account for about 91 percent of sales, according to
the company''s most recent annual statement. </p>
<p>Monster Beverage''s revenue climbed an average of 24 percent
in each of the past five years, compared with 15 percent for
Coca-Cola and 14 percent for PepsiCo, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Monster''s operating margin of 27 percent in 2011
was the highest among publicly traded North American soft-drink
companies with a market value greater than $500 million, the
data show. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Morgan
Stanley''s executive compensation packages received endorsements
from ISS Proxy Services USA, the firm whose negative
recommendation helped sink a similar plan at Citigroup Inc. </p>
<p>JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley displayed reasonable
alignment between shareholder returns and pay for Jamie Dimon
and James Gorman, the firms'' respective chief executive
officers, ISS analysts wrote in separate reports dated April 27.
Glass Lewis  Co., another shareholder advisory firm, also
endorsed the pay plans for the New York-based banks, which will
hold their meetings on May 15. </p>
<p>Citigroup Inc. shareholders rejected an executive pay plan
earlier this month, a first among the six largest U.S. banks,
amid criticism it lets CEO Vikram Pandit collect millions of
dollars in rewards too easily from the No. 3-ranked (C) U.S. lender.
ISS had urged investors to reject Citigroup''s plan. </p>
<p>ISS said that while JPMorgan continues to resist adopting
incentive plans with pre-established goals and long-term
objectives, it added a feature that provides both an
incentive for sustained performance and some mitigation against
excessive risk-taking. </p>
<p>Glass Lewis and ISS also endorsed a shareholder proposal to
require an independent board chairman, which the bank opposes.
Dimon holds the titles of chairman and CEO. </p>
<h2>Inability'' to Monitor </h2>
<p>Dimon, 56, was awarded $23 million in salary and bonuses
for his 2011 performance, the same as he received for 2010,
JPMorgan said in a regulatory filing this month. Gorman, 53, had
his package cut 25 percent to $10.5 million, Morgan Stanley (MS) said
in a filing. </p>
<p>Mark Lake, a Morgan Stanley spokesman, declined to comment,
as did JPMorgan''s Joe Evangelisti. </p>
<p>Glass Lewis told shareholders to vote against the election
of director Ellen Futter to JPMorgan''s board. Futter, president
of the Museum of Natural History, previously served on the board
of American International Group Inc. (AIG), the insurer rescued by the
U.S. government in a bailout that swelled to $182.3 billion. </p>
<p>Futter, who has served on JPMorgan''s board since 1997,
showed an inability to effectively monitor credit risk during
her tenure at AIG, and JPMorgan''s investment activities do
not appear to be any less complex than those of AIG, Glass-
Lewis said in its report. JPMorgan has donated an undisclosed
sum to the New York museum Futter runs, the proxy firm said. ISS
recommended shareholders elect Futter. </p>
<p>Futter didn''t immediately respond to e-mails sent through
the museum seeking comment on Glass Lewis''s recommendation. </p>
<h2>Easing Concerns </h2>
<p>JPMorgan''s stock dropped 22 percent last year and Morgan
Stanley fell 44 percent, compared with 18 percent for the
Standard  Poor''s 500 Financials Index. </p>
<p>While Morgan Stanley investors remain concerned about the
company''s continued lagging returns, concerns may be mitigated
by the fact that 2012 incentive awards for the CEO, based on
2011 performance, decreased by 45 percent due to the absence of
a cash bonus payment and stock options, ISS wrote. </p>
<p>ISS opposed Morgan Stanley''s proposal to set aside 50
million shares to cover future equity-compensation awards. ISS
said the shares would bring the total available, along with
outstanding options and unvested previous awards, above the
proxy firm''s allowable cap. Glass Lewis recommended shareholders
vote for the proposal. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley responded to ISS''s opposition in a
regulatory filing today, saying the proxy adviser compared the
firm with a broader range of companies than its direct
competitors. It said a rejection of the proposal would hinder
the bank''s ability to both align shareholder and employee
interests and to comply with guidance from regulators on pay. </p>
<h2>Poor Disclosure'' </h2>
<p>Glass Lewis recommend shareholders vote against Laura D. Tyson, a professor at University of California, Berkeley''s Haas
School of Business, who has been an adviser to the Obama
administration and has served on Morgan Stanley''s board since
1997. Tyson, as head of the bank''s governance committee, should
be held responsible for its poor disclosure regarding
transactions with entities affiliated with directors, the proxy
firm said. ISS didn''t oppose any directors. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley doesn''t have any shareholder proposals up
for vote. </p>

<p>Barnes  Noble Inc. (BKS)''s partnership
with Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will accelerate its first expansion into
international markets by providing access to millions of
customers, Chief Executive Officer William Lynch said. </p>
<p>We don''t aspire to be anything less than being a leader
in international markets when we launch, Lynch said today in a
telephone interview. We couldn''t have done a better deal and
had a better partner than Microsoft that allows us to compete
internationally. </p>
<p>Microsoft is investing $300 million in a new subsidiary
that combines Barnes  Noble''s Nook e-reader and college
bookstore businesses, the New York-based retailer said today in
a statement. Microsoft will own about 18 percent of the unit, 
which has yet to be named, and Barnes  Noble will own the 
remainder. The investment values the unit at about $1.7 billion, 
more than Barnes  Noble''s total market capitalization of about 
$800 million on April 27. </p>
<p>Barnes  Noble has been working to expand sales of the Nook
and e-books outside the U.S., including distributing to retail
partners. The venture with Microsoft will develop a Nook
application for Windows 8, the newest version of Microsoft''s
operating system that will be released this year. That will
allow Barnes  Noble to offer its digital content to consumers
in Europe, Asia and Latin America, Lynch said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Wells
Fargo  Co. (WFC) and Colgate-Palmolive Co. (CL) sold bonds as yields on
highly rated corporate debt fell to record lows. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
issued $2 billion of 3.3 percent, three-year notes, while San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo issued $1.5 billion of 2.1 percent,
five-year securities, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Colgate, the world''s largest toothpaste maker, sold $500 million
of 2.3 percent, 10-year notes. </p>
<p>The companies are raising money in the bond market after
yields on U.S. investment-grade debt fell to 3.37 percent on
April 27, the lowest ever and down from 3.9 percent at the
beginning of the year, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data. </p>
<p>Bank bonds have returned 6.1 percent this year through
April 27, beating the 3.6 percent average gain for all
investment-grade debt, as Europe''s sovereign debt crisis eased,
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. While spreads on
the financial debt fell to 268 basis points on April 27, that''s
almost 1 percentage point above last year''s low of 173 in April. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps on Goldman Sachs have fallen to 269
basis points as of 3:48 p.m. today from 327 basis points at the
beginning of the year, Bloomberg data show. Contracts on Wells
Fargo cost 88, down from 144 on Jan. 2. </p>
<p>The contracts, which typically fall as investor confidence
improves and rise as it deteriorates, pay the buyer face value
if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the value of
the defaulted debt. </p>
<p>The Goldman Sachs bonds priced to yield 295 basis points
more than similar-maturity Treasuries, and the Wells Fargo notes
were issued at a 130 basis-point premium, Bloomberg data show.
Colgate issued its debt at a spread of 58. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point. </p>

<p>Economists at Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. predicted that payrolls in the U.S. climbed by 125,000 in
April, compared with a 120,000 increase the previous month. </p>
<p>Led by Jan Hatzius in New York, the group''s forecast
compares with a 162,000 median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey of 79 economists ahead of the May 4 employment report
from the Labor Department. Hatzius cited unseasonably warm
winter as the main reason for the projection. </p>
<p>Gains in hiring and wages are needed to support household
purchasing, which increased 0.3 percent in March, Commerce
Department figures show. An unemployment rate exceeding 8
percent for more than three years helps explain why Federal
Reserve policy makers are sticking to a plan to boost growth and
employment by holding borrowing costs low through late 2014. </p>
<p>We are forecasting a nonfarm payroll gain of just 125,000
in April because we expect a substantial payback for the warm
winter, Hatzius wrote in an April 27 note to clients. The
payroll acceleration in the winter was confined to the normally
cold states. Moreover, the fact that March payroll gains in the
cold states looked similar to the pre-winter norm suggests that
most of the payback has yet to occur. </p>
<p>Unseasonably mild temperatures may have spurred more hiring
in some industries. The January to March period was the warmest
first quarter in records going back to 1895, according to the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. </p>
<p>The weather effect will lead to a payback of at least
50,000 in the April report, Hatzius wrote. The evidence for
slower U.S. growth is accumulating. </p>

20 times. </p>
<p>Turning the tables on the spammer in early April felt
satisfying, she said. Still, it hasn''t stanched the flood. </p>
<p>I don''t even get that much junk mail in my Gmail
account, said Brockell, a 31-year-old journalist who lives in
Washington, D.C. This is my phone. It seems more personal. </p>
<p>The unwelcome messages that have been clogging e-mail
inboxes for two decades have made the jump to handsets, as more
people use smartphones in place of personal computers and
texting becomes more popular. The number of U.S. spam text
messages rose 45 percent last year to 4.5 billion messages, said
Richi Jennings, an industry analyst. Spam phone calls also are
proliferating. The surge is costing carriers money and
frustrating users, who must pay for the messages and deal with
potentially fraudulent texts. </p>
<p>Spammers can get phone numbers from the Internet, or use
software or websites to randomly generate thousands or even
millions of numbers in a particular area code. Often using
prepaid phones that can''t be traced back to the sender, they can
then use auto-dialing technology to reach recipients. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said a
proposed Federal Reserve rule seeking to limit links between
banks could cut U.S. economic growth by as much as 0.4
percentage point and eliminate as many as 300,000 jobs. </p>
<p>The estimate, the most specific so far in reaction to the
Fed''s proposed rule, was based on New York-based Goldman Sachs''s
own research and assessment of how it would affect the corporate
debt market, according to an April 30 letter to the Fed that was
made public yesterday. </p>
<p>The impact on the corporate bond market alone could drive
the elimination of 150,000 to 300,000 American jobs, wrote
Goldman Sachs Chief Risk Officer Craig W. Broderick. Smaller
companies that lack access to alternative sources of capital --
and that drive job creation -- would be hardest hit. </p>
<p>The bank joined rivals including JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM),
Citigroup Inc. (C) and Morgan Stanley in opposing a rule that would
limit financial firms with at least $500 billion in assets from
having credit risk to any other exceeding 10 percent of its
regulatory capital plus excess loan-loss reserves. That limit is
stricter than a 25 percent limit that''s applied more broadly to
banks in the Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, had
$77.1 billion in total regulatory capital and no loan-loss
reserves as of Dec. 31, according to the firm''s annual filing. </p>
<p>Chief executive officers of the largest U.S. banks,
including New York-based JPMorgan, are set to meet with Fed
Governor Daniel Tarullo today to discuss the proposed rule as
well as the Fed''s recent stress tests of banks, four people
familiar with the meeting said earlier this week. </p>
<h2>Derivatives Market Impact </h2>
<p>One concern for the banks is how the limits would affect
the market for derivatives. As of December, five firms accounted
for 96 percent of the total U.S. banking industry''s notional
holdings in derivatives and 86 percent of the industry''s net
current credit exposure in derivatives, according to the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency. </p>
<p>The proposed limits greatly overstate credit exposures,
particularly with respect to counterparty exposure arising from
derivatives, Citigroup Chief Risk Officer Brian Leach said in
a letter to the Fed. The overstatement of the credit exposure
will require financial institutions to substantially reduce
lending to customers, reduce market-making activities in
derivative instruments on behalf of customers, and either
purchase less credit protection, or purchase credit protection
from smaller, less well-capitalized institutions or from shadow
banking'' firms. </p>
<h2>Technical Flaws'' </h2>
<p>The Fed''s method of measuring counterparty credit doesn''t
consider that some contracts offset each other and that trading
partners receive collateral to mitigate potential risks,
according to Goldman Sachs''s letter. These issues, along with
other technical flaws in the proposed rule''s approach, would
lead counterparty exposures to be overestimated by as much as
four to 18 times the actual risk, the company wrote. </p>
<p>A firm also may be hindered in lending to small businesses
if its attempt to buy protection from other banks pushes it over
the exposure limits, according to Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>The Fed should conduct a full quantitative impact study
on the overstatement of exposure and interconnectedness under
the so-called single counterparty credit limit and the
implications of that overstatement for U.S. financial markets
and U.S. economic activity, according to the letter. </p>
<h2>Business Roundtable </h2>
<p>Groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the
Business Roundtable have successfully challenged the legality of
other regulatory measures by claiming authorities didn''t fully
assess the costs. </p>
<p>In July, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington overturned
a Securities and Exchange Commission rule that would have
expanded shareholder rights. That has made future SEC rules
vulnerable to similar challenges, forcing agency Chairman Mary Schapiro to redouble efforts to study cost-benefit effects,
slowing the rulemaking process. </p>
<p>Michael Bleier, a former Fed lawyer and now a partner at
Reed Smith LLP, said the banks'' comments will sway regulators
and that the central bank may have to rethink its analysis. </p>
<p>The Fed will ultimately have to raise that 10 percent
limit, Bleier said. That should be accompanied by some type
of economic analysis to determine what the right number is. </p>
<p>The limits also could reduce banks'' use of clearinghouses
to trade derivatives and damage sovereign-debt markets because
banks would be limited in how much credit they could extend to
foreign governments, according to the letter. </p>
<h2>Aggregation Requirement </h2>
<p>The proposed rules'' aggregation requirement also creates
difficulties by casting the net too broadly, Goldman Sachs
wrote. It requires covered companies to aggregate all
controlled'' subsidiaries, defined as 25 percent or more of the
voting shares or equity, which will be difficult for covered
companies to do in practice. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), the sixth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, said
the Fed''s definition of what constitutes controlling a
subsidiary would force it to include the exposures held by a
Japanese joint venture that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306)
operates. Including those risks would constrain its ability to
enter into credit transactions with counterparties whose
obligations are also held by the joint venture, Morgan Stanley
Chief Risk Officer Keishi Hotsuki wrote in a letter to the Fed. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, in a list of recommendations to the central
bank, said the 25 percent limit on single counterparty credit
should be applied to all companies regardless of asset size
and that clearinghouses and high-quality sovereigns be
excluded from the limits. Subsidiaries also should be excluded
unless they''re consolidated for financial-reporting purposes,
according to the letter. </p>
<p>The firm called on the Fed to let companies wait until July
2015 to conform to the rules and spend an additional five years
to implement monitoring of the limits. </p>
<p>This additional time would allow covered companies to
carefully reduce their excess exposures, Goldman Sachs wrote.
Allowing time for this to occur would reduce the risk of fire
sales'' or serious market disruptions. </p>

<p>General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP), the
second-biggest U.S. shopping-mall owner, said funds from
operations excluding some items rose in the first quarter as
tenant sales climbed amid increased consumer spending. </p>
<p>The company''s so-called core FFO rose to $222.1 million, or
22 cents a share, from $208.2 million, or 21 cents, a year
earlier, the Chicago-based company said today in a statement.
Analysts expected core FFO, which excludes items such as
discontinued operations and interest expense on repaid debt, of
21 cents a share, the average of nine estimates in a Bloomberg
survey. FFO is a measure of a property owner''s ability to
generate cash. </p>
<p>The real estate investment trust in January completed its
spinoff of 30 malls that have lower tenant sales into a company
known as Rouse Properties Inc. (RSE), allowing General Growth to focus
on its better-performing retail centers. Mall owners,
particularly those with top-tier properties, are benefiting from
rising rents and occupancies, said Keith Bokota, an analyst at
Des Moines, Iowa-based Principal Global Investors. </p>
<p>Malls have done pretty well, Bokota said in a telephone
interview yesterday. We''ve seen property-level income growing
at a pretty good clip. </p>
<p>Principal Financial owned 7.7 million shares of General
Growth at the end of December, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Consumer Spending Rises </h2>
<p>Consumer spending in March rose 0.3 percent, after a
revised 0.9 percent gain the prior month that was higher than
first reported. Household purchases account for about 70 percent
of the U.S. economy. </p>
<p>General Growth''s comparable tenant sales in the first
quarter increased 9.6 percent to $525 per square foot on a
trailing 12-month basis. </p>
<p>The company raised its forecast for full-year core FFO to
92 cents to 96 cents a share from 90 cents to 94 cents. </p>
<p>The results were released after the close of regular U.S.
trading. General Growth rose 0.7 percent to $17.92 in New York. </p>
<p>Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG), the only U.S. mall owner larger
than General Growth, on April 27 reported first-quarter results
that were higher than analysts'' estimates and increased its
dividend. </p>

<p>International Business Machines Corp. (IBM),
the world''s largest computer-services provider, has offered
incentives to some long-serving and senior U.S. employees to
retire by the end of next year. </p>
<p>Eligible employees who volunteer to retire by Dec. 31,
2013, may work 60 percent of their hours for 70 percent of their
pay and retain full-time equivalent benefits, Doug Shelton, a
spokesman for Armonk, New York-based IBM said today. </p>
<p>The eligible include some of the company''s most senior and
experienced employees -- those with more than 30 years at IBM,
those older than 55 who have worked there more than 15 years,
and those older than 62 with more than five years at IBM --
provided they had satisfactory performance ratings in 2011 and
meet some other criteria. </p>
<p>The so-called transition program follows IBM''s efforts
since 2005 to help some full-time employees move into teaching
and a plan introduced in 2008 that encourages staff into public
service. </p>
<p>It''s strictly voluntary, but provides incentives to keep
retirement eligible employees on board to give them time to plan
for what they want to do after they retire, Shelton said. It
allows the company to plan for their retirement as well, because
we''ll be in a better position to identify what skills and
resources we need as people retire. </p>

Pfizer''s best investment of cash is the drugmaker''s stock.
There''s always a discontinuity between what the street sees
and puts in our share price for our pipeline, and what we can
see in our pipeline, Chief Financial Officer Frank D''Amelio
said today in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>Pfizer is trying to move past its dependence on Lipitor,
the best-selling cholesterol pill that lost marketing
exclusivity last November. Investors are awaiting more clarity
on how Read will divest the company''s animal health unit,
scheduled to be announced by July. The world''s biggest drugmaker
said last month it would sell its infant nutrition unit to
Vevey, Switzerland-based Nestle SA (NESN) for $11.9 billion. </p>
<p>Read also is reorganizing the company''s brand-name drug
business to separate it from what Pfizer calls the established
products line, including medicines that have gone off-patent
as well as emerging markets sales. </p>
<h2>Get a Feel'' </h2>
<p>I''ve got to get a feel for how the two business units
look and feel and run, Read said today in a telephone
interview. I''ve got to get a feel for how the innovative core
strengthens its pipeline. </p>
<p>Read said he hasn''t yet considered splitting brand-name and
established products into different companies. It''s far too
premature to talk about the businesses being separate. </p>
<p>Tony Butler, an analyst with Barclays Capital in New York,
said he doesn''t forecast an increase in revenue for Pfizer from
now until 2020. </p>
<p>What you''re left with after the divestiture is a
pharmaceutical business that will be smaller, but has a number
of challenges from a growth perspective, Butler said today in
an interview with Bloomberg TV. New products drive revenue
change, and while Pfizer does have some, they''re not enough. </p>
<h2>Profit Falls </h2>
<p>Earlier today, the New York-based company reported first-
quarter profit fell 19 percent after revenue from Lipitor
declined because of generic competition. The company trimmed its
2012 forecast after the sale of the nutritional unit. </p>
<p>Net income dropped to $1.79 billion, or 24 cents a share,
from $2.2 billion, or 28 cents, a year earlier. Earnings
excluding one-time items beat by 2 cents the 56-cent average of
19 analysts estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Pfizer declined less than 1 percent to $22.78 at the close
in New York. The shares have gained 8.6 percent in the past 12
months. </p>
<p>Pfizer plans to release data on its Alzheimer''s treatment,
bapineuzumab, in the third quarter of this year, Olivier Brandicourt, president of primary care, said today on a
conference call discussing the earnings. </p>
<p>Pfizer, Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) and Elan Corp. (ELN) are partners on
the Alzheimer''s drug. One of the two studies Pfizer is
conducting has finished, and another will be done in several
months, Brandicourt said. And on May 9, a panel advising the FDA
will make recommendations on tofacitinib, Pfizer''s experimental
pill to treat arthritis. </p>
<h2>No Surprises </h2>
<p>There''s nothing they''ve done that''s been shocking or
concerning to us, Geno Germano, Pfizer''s president of
specialty care, said of the regulators'' review. The FDA is
scheduled to rule on tofacitinib by Aug. 20, and the drug if
approved may be worth $1.5 billion to Pfizer this year, John Boris, an analyst for Citigroup, said in a note to clients. </p>
<p>Eliquis, a blood thinner developed with Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co., will get an FDA decision by the end of June. The
drugmakers will split sales from the pill, which Tim Anderson,
an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in New York,
estimates at $2.5 billion annually by 2015. </p>
<p>Pfizer said full-year profit will be $1.23 to $1.38 a
share, compared with a previous forecast for as much as $1.52.
The change was from sale of company''s the nutrition unit, the
drugmaker said. </p>
<h2>Revenue Decline </h2>
<p>Revenue fell to $15.4 billion from $16.5 billion a year
earlier, hurt by a 25 percent drop in sales from its
pharmaceutical business because of the loss of Lipitor''s U.S.
patent protection. The sales decline was made up for with a 7
percent cut to costs, excluding the impact of foreign exchange,
part of Read''s plan to make the company more efficient. </p>
<p>Pfizer also said that it took a $450 million charge after
agreeing to settle a lawsuit with Brigham Young University over
credit for development of the arthritis painkiller Celebrex. </p>
<p>Sales of Lipitor, still Pfizer''s best-selling drug, fell 42
percent to $1.4 billion. Those declines were led by a 71 percent
fall in the U.S., after the cholesterol pill lost patent
exclusivity in November. </p>
<p>Read said last week that Pfizer is deciding how it will
shed the animal health unit, which makes drugs for pets and
livestock and had sales of $4.18 billion last year. The
drugmaker is likely to divest the unit in a combined initial
public offering and share swap, he said, in which Pfizer would
sell some stock on the open market and exchange a portion of
Pfizer shares for stock in the new company. </p>

<p>William Bryan Jennings, the Morgan
Stanley (MS) U.S. bond-underwriting chief accused of stabbing a New
York cab driver over a fare, will leave his fate to a judge
rather than a jury. </p>
<p>Jennings appeared today in state court in Stamford,
Connecticut, where he waived his right to a jury trial. Judge
Richard F. Comerford Jr. set a pretrial hearing for May 25. </p>
<p>The route to the quickest resolution of this matter is by
a judge, a defense attorney, Eugene Riccio, said after the
hearing. Riccio said he will also continue to pursue a motion to
dismiss the charges. His client had no comment on the case. </p>
<p>Assistant State''s Attorney Steven Weiss had no immediate
comment on the case. </p>
<p>Jennings is accused of attacking the driver, Mohamed Ammar,
on Dec. 22 with a 2 1/2-inch blade and using racial slurs after
a 40-mile ride from New York to the banker''s home in Darien,
Connecticut. Ammar, a native of Egypt and a U.S. citizen, said
Jennings called him a name and said, I''m going to kill you.
You should go back to your country, according to the police
report. </p>
<p>Jennings faces assault and hate-crime charges, which each
brings a maximum sentence of five years in prison. He''s also
charged with not paying the fare, a misdemeanor. He pleaded not
guilty March 9. </p>
<h2>Motion to Dismiss </h2>
<p>On March 28, Jennings filed a motion seeking to have the
case dismissed, arguing Ammar contradicted himself in statements
to the police. The case should be dropped because the arrest
warrant contains false statements and omissions that seriously
undermine Ammar''s credibility, according to the filing. </p>
<p>Jennings flagged Ammar down in front of Ink48, a hotel on
Manhattan''s West Side, sometime before 11 p.m. after the banker
said his car service didn''t appear, according to the police
report. Jennings had attended a company Christmas party. </p>
<p>Ammar told police that once they reached Jennings''s
$3.4 million home, he refused to pay the $204 fare they had
agreed on. He said he drove away trying to find police and that
during the ride the banker stabbed him in the hand. Jennings
said they never agreed on an amount and Ammar demanded $294,
which he viewed as exorbitant. </p>
<p>Jennings said in his motion that Ammar told police the
night of the incident that it occurred in or near his driveway,
and that he drove away with Jennings in the car and was then
able to dial 911. </p>
<h2>Driver''s Account </h2>
<p>A week later, the driver said the stabbing happened after
he had driven off to find police and that they were on Route 1
in Darien, according to Jennings''s filing. </p>
<p>Ammar didn''t tell the police about the derogatory remarks
on the night of the incident, according to the filing. He first
mentioned them a week later, it said. </p>
<p>Jennings said Ammar unlawfully restrained him by
driving away with him in the car, to the point that the banker
feared he was being taken back to New York City. </p>
<p>The banker said he never stabbed Ammar, according to his
police statement. He told police the driver cut his hand trying
to grab the knife from him, which he said he wielded because he
feared he was being abducted. Ammar denied that he tried to take
Jennings back to New York. </p>
<p>Jennings turned himself in two weeks later after a vacation
in Florida and was charged with second-degree assault, theft of
services and intimidation by bias or bigotry. He said he never
threatened to kill Ammar or told him to go back to his country. </p>
<p>Pen Pendleton, a spokesman for New York-based Morgan
Stanley, said March 2 that Jennings has been put on leave. </p>
<p>The case is State of Connecticut v. Jennings 12-0176761,
Superior Court for the State of Connecticut (Stamford). </p>

<p>The National Oil Co. of Liberia will
hold talks with Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Canadian Overseas
Petroleum Ltd. after it approved in principle a plan that would
see Exxon take 70 percent control of an offshore oil block. </p>
<p>Nocal looks forward to working with Exxon Mobil and COPL
to conclude a fair contractual agreement and bring the saga of
Block 13 to a satisfactory conclusion, Randolph A.K.W.
McClain, president and chief executive officer of the Liberian
company, said in a statement published yesterday on its website. </p>
<p>The proposed deal will see the current owners of the block,
Isle of Man-registered Peppercoast Petroleum Plc, transfer its
100 percent interest to a unit of Calgary-based Canadian
Overseas (XOP), known as COPL. </p>
<p>Exxon will immediately get a 70 percent stake from COPL,
according to the statement from Nocal, as the Liberian company
is known. </p>
<p>The talks will take place in London next week and include
McClain, as well as Liberia''s ministers of justice, finance and
lands, mines and energy, according to Nocal. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) President and
Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn was in the hot seat last night
at the Friends of the High Line Spring Benefit, supporting the
park built on elevated railroad tracks along Manhattan''s far
West Side. </p>
<p>On stage to accept an award on behalf of the company, Cohn
was seated right behind the lectern. This meant that whenever
someone spoke, he, too, was captured on the giant projection
screens around the room, in his gray suit and pink tie with sea
horses on it. </p>
<p>While Occupy Wall Street protests were taking place across
the U.S. yesterday, Cohn managed to smile and look interested
through speeches by Sarah Jessica Parker and Darren Walker, an
officer at the Ford Foundation who spoke of the importance of
High Line programs for the 5,000 public-housing residents who
live next to the park. </p>
<p>Artist Jeff Koons talked about his expensive idea to
suspend a real, working train car vertically above the High
Line. He was in the right room to court a funder for the
project, with guests including Pershing Square Capital
Management founder Bill Ackman and David Rockefeller, board
chairman of the Rockefeller Foundation. </p>
<p>Cohn, for his part, said Goldman and its people have given
more than $6 million to the High Line and more than $1 billion
to philanthropic initiatives in the past five years. </p>
<h2>Pier 57 Menu </h2>
<p>Most of the 1,000 guests gathered at Pier 57 talked through
the remarks, distracted by the succulents decorating the tables
courtesy of Bronson van Wyck, and the family-style meal courtesy
of the caterer Bite. Among the offerings were spiced fried
chicken with ginger watermelon skewers, shaved black kale with
hen-of-the-woods and slow-braised short ribs. Parker House rolls
and pats of butter seasoned with thyme and sea salt accompanied. </p>
<p>Another diversion was the people-spotting: film director
Spike Lee, actor Ed Norton and New York City Planning Commission
Chairwoman Amanda Burden were all present. </p>
<p>Later, Cohn and Koons sat together at the head table with
Google (GOOG) Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt, whose date was his
daughter Sophie, and former chairman and chief executive of
Morgan Stanley, John Mack, whose companions were his children
Jenna and Stephen. </p>
<p>Cohn said his favorite conversation of the night was with
Barry Diller, chairman and senior executive of
IAC/InterActiveCorp. (IACI) </p>
<p>We talked about the world and the regulatory
environment, he said as the party wound down, around 11 p.m. </p>
<p>The benefit raised more than $3 million. The party favor
was an umbrella with a rendering of the Train project by
Koons. </p>
<h2>Playing Safe </h2>
<p>An umbrella was also the giveaway at today''s Central Park
Conservancy benefit, where the total raised was $3.5 million and
one corporate sponsor of note was JPMorgan Chase  Co. </p>
<p>Mary Erdoes, chief executive, J.P. Morgan Asset Management,
announced the firm''s $3 million donation to Central Play,
the conservancy''s campaign to renovate Central Park playgrounds. </p>
<p>So far the conservancy has renovated five playgrounds for
safety, accessibility, sustainability and fun, said the park''s
chief administrator, Douglas Blonsky. The work at 16 other
playgrounds will take place over the next seven years and cost
about $30 million, he added. </p>
<p>The luncheon under a tent in the park''s Conservatory Garden
was a fashion playground for 1,200 guests. Erdoes wore a gray
Roland Mouret dress and Abigail Aldridge hat purchased at the
Hat Shop on New York''s Thompson Street. </p>
<h2>Albee''s Bark </h2>
<p>Edward Albee made his presence known last night at the PEN
American Center''s 90th anniversary gala. </p>
<p>You''re going on too long! the author of Who''s Afraid
of Virginia Woolf? barked at fellow playwright Tony Kushner
under the blue whale at the American Museum of Natural History. </p>
<p>At the podium, Albee accepted the PEN Literary Service
Award and recounted his youthful misadventures as poet, novelist
and short-story writer. He also improvised a brief interview
with a tyro reporter, playing both roles, before praising PEN
for championing freedom of expression for writers, editors and
publishers around the world. </p>
<p>The value of PEN was made clear by the others honored. </p>
<h2>Imprisoned Publisher </h2>
<p>The 2012 Jeri Laber International Freedom to Publish Award
went to Turkey''s Ragip Zarakolu, whose Belge Publishing House
has translated and published Turkish editions of works by
Armenian, Greek and Kurdish writers on such subjects as the
Armenian genocide and the repression of the Kurdish minority. </p>
<p>His children Seref and Zerrin Holle accepted the award.
Zarakolu is in prison for allegedly endorsing terrorism. </p>
<p>Eskinder Nega, a jailed Ethiopian journalist and blogger on
trial for terrorism, received the PEN/Barbara Goldsmith Freedom
to Write Award. He is being held in Maekelawi Prison in Addis
Ababa, and may face the death penalty if convicted. </p>
<p>His wife, Serkalem Fasil, traveled to New York to accept
the award on her husband''s behalf. </p>
<p>Prison has been Eskinder''s home away from home for the
past two decades, she told the audience. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sold $1.4
billion of bonds backed by debt on a Hawaiian mall, according to
a person familiar with the offering. </p>
<p>A $1 billion slice carrying top grades and maturing in 9.91
years yields 135 basis points more than the benchmark swap rate,
said the person, who declined to be identified because the terms
aren''t public. A portion rated Baa3 by Moody''s Investors
Service, the lowest investment-grade ranking, yields 260 basis
points more than the benchmark. </p>
<p>The deal is composed of a single loan on a 2.42 million
square-foot property in Honolulu, Hawaii, according to
Morningstar Inc. The mortgaged parcel consists primarily of the
Ala Moana Center, an open-air mall anchored by stores including
Macy''s and Neiman Marcus, Morningstar said in a report earlier
this month. </p>
<p>Wall Street banks have arranged about $8 billion in deals
backed primarily by shopping malls, office buildings and hotels
in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Banks issued
$28 billion in 2011. Sales are forecast to climb as high as $45
billion this year, according to Credit Suisse Group AG. </p>
<p>The market for bonds tied to everything from skyscrapers to
strip malls was roiled this month by the auction of $7.5 billion
in commercial real estate debt assumed by the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York in the rescue of American International Group
Inc. </p>
<p>Relative yields on benchmark securities narrowed by as much
as 15 basis points, or 0.15 percentage point, to 225 basis
points over the swap rate last week after the district bank
completed the sale, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. </p>

<p>General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP) Chief
Executive Officer Sandeep Mathrani said his company would be
interested in buying Vornado Realty Trust (VNO)''s best shopping malls
should they be put up for sale. </p>
<p>I like the malls, and I''m sure if they come to market
we''d hope to be able to participate in attempting to buy the A''
malls, Mathrani said today in response to a question about
Vornado''s plans on General Growth''s quarterly conference call
with analysts. </p>
<p>Vornado plans to reduce our exposure to the enclosed-mall
business, Steven Roth, the company''s chairman, said in his
annual letter to investors on April 13. Before becoming CEO of
Chicago-based General Growth last year, Mathrani was president
of New York-based Vornado''s retail division. </p>
<p>Investor demand for malls is rising as landlords boost
rents and occupancies amid increasing consumer spending.
Vornado, in its latest annual report, listed seven properties in
its regional-mall portfolio. The retail centers are in New York,
New Jersey, Virginia and Puerto Rico, and include Springfield
Mall in Springfield, Virginia, a 1.4 million-square-foot
(130,000-square-meter) property that the company plans to
continue renovating, Roth said in the letter. </p>
<p>General Growth, the biggest U.S. shopping-mall owner after
Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG), said yesterday that funds from
operations excluding some items rose in the first quarter as
tenant sales increased. </p>
<p>General Growth rose 2.3 percent to $18.34 today in New
York. The shares have gained 13 percent in the past year.
Vornado climbed 0.1 percent to $87.60 today and has lost 9.5
percent in the past 12 months. </p>

New York, didn''t disclose terms of the acquisition. </p>
<p>The world''s largest computer-services provider expects

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) was sued by Asset
Management Fund for fraud in New York state court over the
purchase of $122.4 million in residential mortgage-backed
securities. </p>
<p>Allegations against the bank include fraud, fraudulent
inducement and negligent misrepresentation over the sale of the
securities, according to documents filed in New York State
Supreme Court yesterday. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s offering materials for the investments
contained material misrepresentations and omissions on the
loans underlying the securities, including the percentage of
owner-occupied properties, the fund said in the court documents. </p>
<p>Plaintiffs did not know the true facts regarding
defendants'' misrepresentations and omissions in the offering
materials, and justifiably relied on those misrepresentations
and omissions, the fund said. </p>
<p>Mark Lake, a spokesman for New York-based Morgan Stanley,
didn''t immediately return a telephone message left at his office
seeking comment on the lawsuit. </p>
<p>Asset Management Fund, based in Chicago, also sued JPMorgan
Chase  Co. in the same court in February over $515.6 million in
residential mortgage-backed securities, and sued Bank of America
Corp. over $239.5 million worth of the investments in March. </p>
<p>Asset Management Fund does business as AMF Funds, according

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) hired Eric Heaton,
Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)''s head of investment banking for financial
services companies in the Americas, according to a person
familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>Heaton will join Morgan Stanley''s wealth management
business in a senior role, according to the person, who declined
to be identified because the company hasn''t publicly announced
the hiring. John Gallagher, a spokesman for Frankfurt-based
Deutsche Bank, declined to comment. So did Christy Pollak, a
spokeswoman for New York-based Morgan Stanley. </p>
<p>During his three years at Deutsche Bank, Heaton helped the
German lender break into the top ranks of the investment-banking
business in the U.S. Deutsche Bank was the fifth-largest adviser
on mergers and acquisitions of financial companies in the
Americas during the past 12 months, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. That compares with a ranking of 44th in 2008. </p>
<p>Heaton''s team at Deutsche Bank worked on some of the firm''s
largest American deals, including ING Groep NV (INGA)''s $9 billion sale
of its U.S. online bank to Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) in
February. </p>
<p>The banker spent most of his career at Merrill Lynch  Co.
In 2007, he was named treasurer of the firm, a role he filled
until the company''s takeover by Bank of America Corp. in 2009. </p>
<p>A month after the sale was completed, Heaton led a team of
12 Merrill financial-services bankers who defected to Deutsche
Bank. Their former employer sued Deutsche Bank over what it
called a hiring raid. </p>
<p>At Morgan Stanley, Heaton will reunite with Greg Fleming,
the former Merrill Lynch president who now oversees Morgan
Stanley''s wealth management business. </p>
<p>Two of Heaton''s brothers, David and Seth, moved with him
from Merrill Lynch to Deutsche Bank. David Heaton, who is Eric''s
twin, joined Morgan Stanley in 2010. </p>

culture, faces a harsh spotlight this month in Manhattan federal
court over how well a senior official guarded its secrets. </p>
<p>Rajat Gupta, a former Goldman Sachs director, goes on trial
May 21 on charges of giving inside information to Raj Rajaratnam, the Galleon Group LLC co-founder serving 11 years in
prison for insider trading. Gupta''s lawyers said they may 
point to others at the bank who passed Rajaratnam illegal tips.
At least three other Goldman Sachs employees are said to be
under investigation related to Galleon insider trading. </p>
<p>The renewed scrutiny of Goldman Sachs comes after the firm
endured a wave of publicity that drove down its stock price in
the short term. Most recently, former derivatives trader Greg Smith in a March New York Times opinion piece criticized the
company''s treatment of clients. Goldman Sachs''s market value
fell $2.15 billion the day it was published. </p>
<p>Earlier this year, a Delaware judge criticized the New
York-based company''s handling of El Paso Corp.''s takeover by
Kinder Morgan (KMI) Inc. In 2010, U.S. Senator Carl Levin called
hearings on the financial industry, and the bank settled a
Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit for $550 million. </p>
<p>It''s almost more like the Chinese water torture, said
William D. Cohan, author of Money and Power: How Goldman Sachs
Came to Rule the World. There''s a cumulative effect -- not
only this trial and this incident but what the judge in the
Delaware Chancery Court wrote about El Paso-Kinder Morgan,
Senator Levin''s all-day hearing, the SEC lawsuit, the relentless
pounding in the media, the Greg Smith thing. </p>
<h2>Won''t Suffer </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s revenue may not suffer, because clients
will continue to turn to the New York-based company, Cohan, a
Bloomberg View columnist, said in a telephone interview. The
bank has outperformed the SP Financials Sector Index this year. </p>
<p>Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, the fifth-
largest U.S. bank by assets, declined to comment on how it will
handle publicity from a monthlong Gupta trial. </p>
<p>Since Levin, a Michigan Democrat, alleged in 2010 that the
firm put its own interests ahead of clients'', Goldman Sachs has
come under persistent criticism. </p>
<p>In July 2010, Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $550 million to
resolve SEC allegations that it misled investors in
collateralized debt obligations linked to subprime mortgages by
not disclosing that hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the
underlying securities and then bet against them. Goldman Sachs 
didn''t admit wrongdoing. Fabrice Tourre, a Goldman Sachs trader 
who was also sued in the case, is fighting the SEC''s allegations. </p>
<h2>Chancery Court </h2>
<p>Delaware Chancery Court Judge Leo Strine rebuked Goldman
Sachs in February for advising El Paso (EP) after Kinder Morgan, in
which it held a $4 billion stake, bid for the company. The
judge, who questioned the bank''s handling of an alleged conflict
of interest, didn''t block the deal, which is expected to close
in the second quarter. </p>
<p>Smith quit in March after writing an opinion piece in the
New York Times describing a toxic and destructive culture, a
claim Goldman Sachs denies. The shares fell 3.4 percent in New
York trading after the article ran. </p>
<p>In an April 25 interview with Bloomberg Television, Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein addressed the damage the
company''s reputation has sustained in recent years. </p>
<p>Shame on us, Blankfein said, for not anticipating
how the public would perceive the firm after the financial
crisis. </p>
<h2>How Important'' </h2>
<p>We''re going to have to do a better job -- we''re going to
have to do a job -- in getting out there in telling people how
important this industry is and what it does when we advise
companies on their growth plans, when we help finance those
growth plans, when we manage their assets for them, and how
important this is for the economy, the markets and obviously
society at large, Blankfein told Bloomberg TV''s Erik Schatzker
on InBusiness With Margaret Brennan. </p>
<p>Gupta''s trial will be first in a nationwide crackdown on
insider trading that started with Rajaratnam''s case in 2009 to
focus squarely on Goldman Sachs. Gupta is accused of tipping
Rajaratnam, his one-time friend and business partner, about the
bank and Procter  Gamble Co. (PG), where Gupta also served as a
director. Gupta ran consulting firm McKinsey  Co. from 1994 to
2003 and was on the Goldman Sachs board from 2006 to 2010. </p>
<h2>Illicit Profits'' </h2>
<p>Tips included details of Goldman Sachs''s earnings in the
first quarter of 2007 and fourth quarter of 2008, as well as the
$5 billion investment in the bank by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/B) in
September 2008, prosecutors said. The leaks generated illicit
profits and loss avoidance of more than $23 million, the SEC
alleged in a related lawsuit. Gupta, who denies wrongdoing,
faces as long as 20 years in prison if convicted of securities
fraud and conspiracy. </p>
<p>Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co., said
there''s no evidence whatsoever that Goldman Sachs''s
investment banking franchise is at risk from the Gupta case. At
the same time, clients will be watching to see who might have
breached a duty to the firm by leaking confidential information. </p>
<p>So long as this does not come from senior people --
managing directors and above -- the damage is manageable,
Hintz said in a telephone interview. If it comes above that,
then you end up with a reputational damage that can affect a
willingness of the clients to engage you. </p>
<h2>Executive Wiretap </h2>
<p>Gary Naftalis, Gupta''s lawyer, has said in court that
prosecutors told him two other Goldman Sachs employees are
suspected of leaking tips about companies including Apple Inc. (AAPL)
and Intel Corp. (INTC) Naftalis said one was an executive caught on a
wiretap talking to Rajaratnam. Without naming the person,
Naftalis said the defense may present evidence of the other
tippers at Gupta''s trial. </p>
<p>Jerika Richardson, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan, declined to comment on the case. Paul Fox,
a spokesman for Cincinnati-based Procter  Gamble, didn''t
immediately return calls for comment. </p>
<p>Bradley Simon, a former federal prosecutor now in private
practice in New York, said the disclosure of other possible
leakers is a gift to Gupta that Naftalis is sure to exploit. </p>
<p>The government has to remove almost all doubt, he said
in a telephone interview. How do you know it wasn''t one of
these individuals instead of Gupta? It does pose a problem for
the government if the jury says, We''re not totally sure.'' Then
they''re obligated to acquit. </p>
<h2>Under Investigation </h2>
<p>Two other Goldman Sachs employees -- David Loeb, head of
Asia Equity Sales in New York and a managing director, and Henry King, a technology analyst in Hong Kong -- are under U.S.
investigation, according to people with knowledge of the probes
who weren''t authorized to speak publicly. It''s unclear if Loeb
or King are the employees referred to by Naftalis and in letters
prosecutors filed in court. </p>
<p>Loeb and King didn''t respond to e-mails seeking comment.
Goldman Sachs has declined to comment on Loeb and King. </p>
<p>A third employee, Matthew Korenberg, a managing director
based in San Francisco, has been the subject of a U.S. insider-
trading investigation for 2 1/2 years related to Galleon, said
his lawyer, John Hueston. Korenberg remained employed by Goldman
Sachs and has never been investigated for passing tips to
Rajaratnam, Hueston said in an April 26 interview. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs has fully cooperated with federal
authorities for more than two years on the Korenberg probe, the
company said in an April 26 statement. </p>
<p>The multiyear investigation that he has been involved
with has resulted in nothing, Hueston said. He has never
tipped any information. He was never alleged to have tipped any
inside information. He has had a distinguished career at Goldman
Sachs. </p>
<h2>May Benefit </h2>
<p>Frank Razzano, a Pepper Hamilton LLP lawyer not involved in
any Galleon-related insider-trading cases, said Gupta''s defense
may benefit from multiple Goldman Sachs executives being
implicated in leaking information. </p>
<p>It''s a very good case if you can come forward with
evidence to show that the government got the wrong person,
said Razzano, who is among the few defense attorneys in the U.S.
to win a client''s acquittal in an insider-trading case. </p>
<p>Jurors are likely to hear from Goldman Sachs executives,
court papers indicate. Blankfein testified at Rajaratnam''s trial
last year that Gupta violated the firm''s confidentiality
policies by allegedly telling Rajaratnam about the firm''s
earnings and strategic plans. </p>
<h2>Relevant'' Information </h2>
<p>In the SEC lawsuit, Gupta''s lawyers have said that
Blankfein, Chief Financial Officer David Viniar, President Gary Cohn, Loeb and retiring Lead Director John Bryan may have
information relevant to the defense. Another possible
witness is Goldman Sachs director Claes Dahlback, a former CEO
of Sweden''s Investor AB, who was interviewed by the government,
prosecutors told a judge in January. </p>
<p>Naftalis declined to comment on his possible witnesses. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s relationship with Galleon may also come
into view. Gupta is alleged to have tipped Rajaratnam in 2007
after listening to a Goldman Sachs board meeting while at
Galleon''s offices. Jurors may hear that Goldman Sachs routinely
catered lunch for Galleon traders, as the bank did for other big
clients, according to an ex-Galleon employee who declined to
comment publicly. </p>
<p>Anthony Sabino, a lawyer and professor at the Peter J.
Tobin College of Business at St. John''s University in New York,
said the publicity will sting even if it doesn''t cost the firm
business. </p>
<p>If you want to do a deal these days in the U.S., you go
to Goldman, you go to Morgan Stanley, he said in a telephone
interview. But when you have multiple instances, then people
may say it''s indicative of a lack of internal controls or a
permissiveness that lets this thing go on. It''s a slap in the
face to management. </p>
<h2>Pickup Basketball'' </h2>
<p>Ronn Torossian, CEO of 5W Public Relations LLC in New York,
which has done work for Coca-Cola Co. (KO) and McDonald''s Corp. (MCD), said
Goldman Sachs should move quickly to reclaim its reputation. </p>
<p>The company should stress to the public that recent events
involve just a few of its 32,000 employees and that it demands
that all employees act ethically, he said. Workers must be
completely above-board, he said, not even cheating in
their pickup basketball games. </p>
<p>Any time you have a stellar firm like that and the words
insider trading'' next to it -- you start to wonder how long
does it go, how much more is there? he said in a telephone
interview. It''s hard to distance yourself from crisis. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Gupta, 11-cr-907, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) won dismissal
of some claims in a lawsuit brought by CIFG Assurance North
America Inc. over $275 million in residential mortgage-backed
securities. </p>
<p>The insurer sued Goldman Sachs in New York State Supreme
Court in Manhattan in August, accusing the investment bank of
making misrepresentations in connection with the securitization
of a portfolio of 6,204 mortgage loans. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs asked the court in October to dismiss six of
the eight claims in the suit, arguing that CIFG was informed of
the risks associated with the investments, failed to conduct due
diligence on its own, and hasn''t sought contractual remedies
that would allow it to seek the repurchase of certain loans. </p>
<p>New York State Supreme Justice O. Peter Sherwood, in an
order filed today, granted Goldman Sachs''s motion to dismiss
three counts, including one for fraudulent inducement, while
denying the New York-based investment bank''s motion to dismiss
three other claims for breach of contract. </p>
<p>CIFG rightly contends that it provided enough support for
the claimed breaches by providing a statistical sampling with
documentation demonstrating the pervasive nature of the
collective breaches in the underlying loans, Sherwood said in
the order. The complaint need not make specific
representations as to each of the individual loans. </p>
<p>Sherwood also granted a motion by Buffalo-based MT Bank
Corp. (MTB) to remove it as a defendant in the suit. </p>
<h2>Considering Options </h2>
<p>Obviously, we''re disappointed that the court dismissed
the fraud charge, but we''ll consider our options going
forward, David Berger, a lawyer for CIFG, said in a phone
interview. The insurer''s lawyers were still reviewing the ruling
and hadn''t decided whether to appeal, he said. </p>
<p>Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment on the ruling in an e-mail. </p>
<p>The case is CIFG Assurance North America Inc. v. Goldman,
Sachs  Co., 652286/2011, New York Supreme Court, New York
County (Manhattan). </p>

<p>A benchmark gauge of corporate credit
risk rose by the most in almost three weeks after data showed
service industries in the U.S. expanded less than forecast as
the economic recovery struggles to gather pace. </p>
<p>The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, added 2.1 basis points to a mid-price of 95.9
basis points at 4:39 p.m. in New York, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. That''s the biggest jump since the measure
recorded an increase of 4.8 basis points on April 13. </p>
<p>The gauge climbed as the Institute for Supply Management''s
non-manufacturing index fell to a four-month low of 53.5 in
April from 56 in March, the Tempe, Arizona-based group''s data
showed today. Earlier, the European Central Bank kept its
benchmark rate at a record-low 1 percent as Mario Draghi, the
bank''s president, said the economic outlook remains uncertain. </p>
<p>The service numbers were a disappointment, and Draghi''s
comments continue to keep Europe''s economic health top of
mind, Joel Levington, managing director of corporate credit at
Brookfield Investment Management Inc. in New York said. That''s
a cocktail which pushes risk measurements higher. </p>
<p>The median forecast of 74 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News called for a decrease to 55.3 in the non-manufacturing
gauge. Readings above 50 signal expansion. </p>
<h2>GM Swaps Drop </h2>
<p>Credit-default swaps on General Motors Co. (GM) dropped by as
much as 21 basis points to a mid-price of 308.5 basis points as
the company reported earnings that beat analyst estimates. The
contracts tied to the world''s largest automaker climbed later in
the day to be unchanged at 329.5 basis points, according to CMA,
which is owned by CME Group Inc. </p>
<p>GM, which is rated one level below investment-grade by
Standard  Poor''s and Moody''s Investors Service, may be in line
for a step up after Ford Motor Co. was raised to high grade by
Fitch Ratings on April 24. The automaker reported first-quarter
profit, excluding some items, of 93 cents a share, which beat
the 85-cent average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. </p>
<p>You are going to see many more rising stars in the
automotive industry, Eric Selle, a JPMorgan Chase  Co. credit
analyst, said in a telephone interview before the earnings
report. There are pluses and minuses on GM and Ford, but when
you look at it, both have investment-grade credit profiles. </p>
<p>Default swaps on GM have fallen from a high of 490 basis
points at the start of the year, while swaps on Ford have
declined by 136.4 basis points as of 5:01 p.m., CMA prices show. </p>
<h2>Chesapeake Bonds Gain </h2>
<p>Chesapeake Energy Corp (CHK)''s $1.3 billion 6.775 percent notes
due in March 2019 rose by 0.375 cent on the dollar to 96.125
cents to yield 7.50 percent, after falling yesterday to the
lowest level since they were issued in February. </p>
<p>JPMorgan raised its recommendation on the debt of the oil
and gas driller to buy from hold, based on cheap
valuation, because the company can overcome liquidity
concerns, analysts at the bank led by Gregg Brody wrote in a
note on May 2. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps on the company dropped 1.7 percentage
points to 7.2 percent upfront as of about 4:15 p.m., CMA prices
show. That means it would cost $720,000 initially and $500,000 a
year to protect $10 million of Chesapeake''s debt for five years. </p>
<p>The 12-month-trailing speculative-grade corporate default
rate in the U.S. rose to 2.6 percent in April from 2.5 percent
in March, SP said in a research note today. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps typically fall as investor confidence
improves and rise as it deteriorates. The contracts pay the
buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations,
less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals
$1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) is likely to face a
two-level downgrade of its credit rating from Moody''s Investors
Service in the next two months, said Donald Jones, a Sterne Agee
 Leach Inc. credit analyst. </p>
<p>The chance of a two-grade cut is 75 percent, which may
cause the firm''s credit spreads to tighten slightly, Jones wrote
in a note to clients today. A one-level downgrade is more likely
than three levels, the maximum reduction Moody''s said in
February that it would make, he wrote. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley faces the largest potential credit downgrade
among U.S. lenders by Moody''s, which will take ratings actions
on the biggest global investment banks by the end of June. A
three-level cut would bring the rating to Baa2, two levels above
junk, from A2. That could force the firm to post more collateral
on derivatives trades and pay more to borrow. </p>
<p>We expect that Moody''s will downgrade most if not all of
the firms put on watch in February, however we think the
downgrades will rest at the better end'' of the spectrum,
Jones said in the note. Part of this expectation is in light
of generally positive first-quarter 2012 results. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer James Gorman and
Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said last month that they''ve
taken steps to ensure any fallout from a downgrade would be
manageable. </p>
<p>A three-level downgrade, a 5 percent to 15 percent
possibility, would lead to spreads widening as much as 1
percentage point, Jones wrote. A one-level cut, a 10 percent to
20 percent likelihood, would cause a rally to the spreads Morgan
Stanley had in February, he wrote. </p>
<p>There is zero likelihood of Moody''s not cutting the
bank''s credit rating at all, he wrote. </p>
<p>Jones cited the posturing and defensive language in
conversation with the agency as a reason for his expectation
that a two-level cut is most likely. </p>

<p>The judge overseeing the bankruptcy of
General Maritime Corp. (GMRRQ) said he will approve its reorganization
plan, giving Oaktree Capital Management LP most of the shipping
company''s new stock after it reached a last-minute agreement to
sell one of its vessels. </p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn in New York today
approved an amended version of the Chapter 11 plan for the
second-largest U.S. owner of oil tankers, subject to final
modifications. </p>
<p>The plan is fair and equitable, Glenn said, noting that
it restructures more than $1.3 billion in pre-bankruptcy debt.
The plan''s terms will cancel all of General Maritime''s old
stock, giving nothing to holders of 121.7 million common shares.
Secured debt will be repaid in full and converted to equity in
the reorganized company, giving 98 percent of stock in a new
firm to Los Angeles-based Oaktree. </p>
<p>General Maritime, which operates in more than 230 ports in
more than 70 countries, filed for bankruptcy in November. The
company listed assets of $1.71 billion and debt of
$1.41 billion in its Chapter 11 petition. In February, when
Glenn approved a draft of the plan, he told creditors to either
prepare evidence for a fight over the final plan or negotiate an
agreement. </p>
<p>An amended version of the plan resolved objections from
most unsecured creditors, improving their estimated recovery
from as much as 1.88 percent to a maximum of 5.41 percent. The
majority of creditors voted in favor of the plan and Glenn
overruled the three objections that remained at the opening of
today''s hearing. </p>
<h2>Meet Terms </h2>
<p>Douglas Mannal, a lawyer for General Maritime, told the
judge that in order to meet the terms of its bankruptcy
operating loan, the New York-based operator of more than 30 oil
tankers made a last-minute decision to sell one of its ships,
the Alexandra, for an estimated $6 million to $8 million. The
firm reached an accord with all creditors on the sale, he said. </p>
<p>The money will go to pay down the debtor-in-possession
loan and give greater liquidity to the company on emergence,
Mannal said. </p>
<p>The revised plan will cut the company''s debt by
$600 million and involve two new credit facilities totaling $783
million, Mannal said. </p>
<p>Unsecured creditors had initially objected to the plan''s
terms, which they said will grant a legal shield to the
directors and officers of the company and Oaktree, a pre-
bankruptcy lender which is also a sponsor of the reorganization. </p>
<h2>Initially Objected </h2>
<p>Unsecured creditors also initially objected that Oaktree
had a deal with the company locked up and that the
reorganization proposal wasn''t made in good faith, citing a
long relationship between Oaktree and General Maritime Chairman
Peter Georgiopoulos. Oaktree has had dealings with General
Maritime since 1999, when it provided the company with a
$15 million loan, creditors said in court papers. </p>
<p>After a probe showed that they could file lawsuits against
parties to some of the company''s loans, unsecured creditors
negotiated improved terms, said Pedro Jimenez, a lawyer for the
committee of unsecured creditors. The new terms give them
$4 million to $6 million in cash and 2 percent of the common
stock in the new company, with warrants to potentially increase
their share, Jimenez said. </p>
<h2>Remaining Objections </h2>
<p>Today''s remaining objections came from senior noteholders
and equity holders, General Maritime said in court papers.
Donald Marro, the holder of senior notes with a face amount of
$50,000, sought to give general unsecured creditors more
benefits. Shareholders objected that the plan gave them no
recovery. </p>
<p>Marro''s objection should be overruled because 69 percent of
claims like his, and 97 percent of his class by dollar amount,
voted to accept the plan, General Maritime said in court papers.
The company also said shareholders couldn''t get a recovery
because creditors in line before them under bankruptcy law won''t
be repaid in full. </p>
<p>General Maritime shares, which traded at 1.4 cents before
today''s hearing, dropped as much as 12 percent afterward to
1.2 cents in over-the-counter trading. The company''s 12 percent
notes due in 2017 traded at 2.78 cents on the dollar on April
19, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. </p>
<p>The case is In re General Maritime Corp., 11-15285, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

Inc. (PFE), Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY) and AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) failed to turn into
drugs will be tested by U.S.-sponsored scientists in a $20
million program to see if they''ll work against ailments they
weren''t aimed at previously. </p>
<p>If the compounds are effective, the time to market will be
shorter and the drugmakers, who retain ownership of the
compounds, will share profits with researchers. Traditionally,
companies spend about $2 billion and take 14 years to develop
therapies, a so-called valley-of-death commitment that''s made
drugmakers move cautiously in deciding which illness to target. </p>
<p>The joint program, a first for the National Institutes of
Health, is designed to lessen drugmakers'' risk, funded by $575
million in President Barack Obama''s fiscal 2013 budget. The
agency cited the HIV treatment AZT, created from failed attempts
to treat cancer, in explaining the partnership. </p>
<p>We need to generate more of these success stories in a
more systematic manner, NIH director Francis Collins said
during a news conference announcing the agreements.. </p>
<p>The compounds that New York-based Pfizer, the world''s
largest drugmaker, Indianapolis-based Lilly and London-based
AstraZeneca will make available already have been found safe in
humans. The drugmakers will give researchers access to the
chemicals and related data, company officials said. </p>
<h2>Just Benefits'' </h2>
<p>For us, there is just benefits, in a way, said Jan Lundberg, executive vice president for science and technology at
Lilly. </p>
<p>Drugmakers will have to provide the compounds to
researchers, which may requiring manufacturing more of the
substances, Lundberg said today in an interview. The companies
also face costs for maintaining patents on the compounds and for
gathering and transmitting clinical data to scientists, said Don
Frail, vice president for science and new opportunities at
London-based AstraZeneca. </p>
<p>There''s not a shelf of discontinued compounds that you
can just pull one off and give to somebody, Frail said in an
interview. Clinical supplies alone, should the compounds enter
human trials, may cost as much as $1 million, he said. </p>
<p>Collins said he is hopeful the work will lead to new
treatments for diseases of the central nervous system, which
have proved so difficult to attack that drug companies are
dissuaded from investing in them. </p>
<h2>Health Crises'' </h2>
<p>Rod Mackenzie, a senior vice president at Pfizer, said
neurological diseases are one of the great health crises we
face across the globe. </p>
<p>We need to do better there, he said during the news
conference. </p>
<p>Should the drugs prove effective against a new disease, the
companies will have the option to develop them into a marketed
product, the agency said. Taxpayers would get a financial
benefit only if an NIH scientist is a researcher on one of the
compounds. Then royalties would flow back to the U.S. agency. </p>
<p>Americans are eagerly awaiting the next generation of
cures and treatments to help them live longer and healthier
lives, said Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, in a statement. To accelerate our nation''s
therapeutic development process, it is essential that we forge
strong, innovative and strategic partnerships across government,
academia and industry. </p>
<p>The bottom-line benefit for the public is societal, Collins
said. Diseases that don''t have treatments now may get one, he
said. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) and Main Street Power
Co. are providing funds that will enable Clean Power Finance
Inc.''s customers to install as much as $300 million in
residential solar energy projects. </p>
<p>The equity investments, along with debt from lenders led by
Zions Bancorporation (ZION), will finance rooftop photovoltaic systems
on homes in California and Arizona, Clean Power Finance said
today in a statement. </p>
<p>The closely held San Francisco-based company has developed
software that connects investors and solar installers that may
lack resources to provide financing for their own customers. </p>
<p>We''re constructing a platform, or as I think of it, a
conduit between the capital markets and the installers,
Kristian Hanelt, senior vice president of renewable capital
markets for Clean Power Finance, said in a phone interview. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley is investing for the tax benefits,
including a 30 percent investment tax credit for solar, while
Main Street will be the long-term owner of the systems, he said. </p>
<p>The MySolar fund is the company''s third and the industry''s
largest for non-military installations, Hanelt said. SolarCity
Inc.''s $1 billion program to install solar panels on military
houses is the largest. It''s backed by $350 million in loans from
Bank of America Corp. and an undisclosed amount of tax-equity
financing from U.S. Bancorp. </p>
<p>We''ve brought together a group of parties who all are
interested in participating in the explosive growth that''s
happening in residential solar, Hanelt said. </p>
<h2>Enabling Solar </h2>
<p>Other companies enabling residential solar, including
SolarCity, SunRun Inc. and Sungevity Inc., finance installations
for homeowners through leases or long-term power purchase
agreements that allow them to install systems at little to no
upfront cost to customers. The companies pick the installers or
do the work themselves. </p>
<p>Clean Power Finance says it''s working with more than 1,500
installers in every U.S. state. </p>
<p>We don''t actually take equity in these projects
ourselves, Hanelt said. We think that''s a bad use of venture
capital dollars and that we''d be better off spending the Kleiner
Perkins and the Google Ventures venture capital on building our
business itself, he said. </p>
<p>Including the latest fund, Clean Power Finance has raised
about $500 million to finance installations for its customers,
according to the statement. Google Inc. (GOOG) created a $75 million
fund in September. The size of the company''s initial fund and
the investors wasn''t made public, Alison Mickey, a Clean Power
Finance spokeswoman, said by e-mail. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc.''s (PFE) Lyrica, approved for use
in fibromyalgia, didn''t work to control painful nerve damage
from diabetes in one study, and the company halted a second
trial in nerve-damaged HIV patients. </p>
<p>Lyrica, with sales of $3.7 billion last year, didn''t
significantly lessen the pain of diabetes patients with nerve
damage who were switched to the drug after another treatment
failed, New York-based Pfizer said. The company also halted a
trial for HIV patients, after an interim analysis showed no
difference between Lyrica and a placebo. </p>
<p>Even before today''s results investors and analysts had
assumed Lyrica sales were near their peak, said Les Funtleyder,
a portfolio manager at Miller Tabak  Co. whose fund owns Pfizer
shares. The drug also is approved for use in pain after
shingles, partial-onset seizures in adults with epilepsy, and
diabetic nerve pain. </p>
<p>The sense is Lyrica has gone about as far as it can go,
Funtleyder said. Maybe it is a slight loss of upside, but we
are not talking about a major hit. </p>
<p>Pfizer, the world''s biggest drugmaker, declined less than 1
percent to $22.38 at the close of New York trading. </p>
<p>About 16 percent of people with diabetes develop pain and
numbness from nerve damage caused by high blood-sugar levels,
according to an April 2011 report from the American Academy of
Neurology. About a third of HIV patients have nerve damage, and
some of these people experience pain, according to the
University of Chicago. </p>
<p>Pfizer said the trial in HIV patients wasn''t ended for
safety reasons. In the diabetes study, the most common adverse
events were fluid retention, dizziness, sleepiness and upper
respiratory tract infection, which are known side effects of the
drug, according to the company''s statement. </p>

<p>Marvel''s The Avengers, Walt Disney
Co. (DIS)''s new superhero movie, took in $18.7 million in midnight
sales at U.S. and Canadian theaters. </p>
<p>The debut was the eighth-best among top films for midnight
openings, Hollywood.com Box-Office said today in an e-mailed
statement. </p>
<p>The movie, featuring Marvel superheros, including Iron
Man, Thor and Captain America, The Avengers, is
forecast to generate as much as $170 million in weekend sales, a
figure that would break the record of $169.2 million set last
year by the final Harry Potter movie. The film already has
taken in $304 million outside the U.S. and Canada, Disney said
in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>The midnight sales include $1.31 million from sold-out
performances on 273 Imax screens, Paul Pflug, a Principal
Communications Group spokesman for Imax Corp. (IMAX), said in an e-
mail. </p>
<p>In the film, the superheros unite to battle an army led by
the evil Norse god Loki. The movie is benefiting from the
popularity of previous films based on the characters, including
Robert Downey Jr.''s two Iron Man movies and last year''s
Thor, which also featured Loki. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will start an
electronic trading system for corporate bonds this month as the
fifth-biggest U.S. bank adapts to regulatory changes and
competition, according to a person familiar with the plans. </p>
<p>The platform, called GSessions, has been under development
for a year, said the person, who declined to be identified
because the New York-based firm isn''t making details public yet.
The Wall Street Journal reported the initiative late yesterday
on its website. </p>
<p>The move comes three weeks after BlackRock Inc. (BLK), the
world''s largest money manager, said it was planning its own
bond-trading platform called Aladdin Trading Network that would
allow clients to bypass Wall Street firms such as Goldman Sachs.
Last year, Goldman Sachs''s revenue from market making and
principal investments in credit, including corporate debt and
derivatives, fell to $2.72 billion from $8.68 billion in 2010,
according to a regulatory filing. </p>
<p>The profitability of Wall Street firms is being challenged
by regulations requiring that they hold more capital as a buffer
against potential losses from assets such as corporate debt. A
U.S. law that seeks to prohibit federally insured banks from
making bets with their own money may also hinder lenders''
ability to commit money to buy securities from clients,
according to analysts including Brad Hintz at Sanford C.
Bernstein  Co. </p>
<h2>Fixed Income </h2>
<p>In presentations over the past two years, Goldman Sachs
executives have said the firm succeeded in developing electronic
trading capabilities in the stock and currency markets and were
also preparing for a higher percentage of fixed-income trading
becoming computerized. </p>
<p>Connectivity with clients and what we call owning the
desktop is going to be very, very important, Chief Financial
Officer David A. Viniar said in a presentation in February 2011.
Having those capabilities, having first-mover advantage, we
think is going to be key coming out after the new regulations. </p>
<p>GSessions will start by offering two five-minute trading
sessions a day, one in an investment-grade bond and another in a
high-yield, high-risk security, the person said. Speculative-
grade, or junk, bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody''s Investors
Service and lower than BBB- at Standard  Poor''s. </p>
<p>At the start of each session, Goldman Sachs will post a bid
and offer price and notify clients of the maximum amount of
liquidity the firm is willing to provide to fill orders,
according to the person. </p>
<h2>Acting as Counterparty </h2>
<p>Rather than matching trades between clients, Goldman Sachs
will act as the counterparty to all trades and collect the
spread, or difference, between the bid and offer prices, the
person said. That gap will be lower than what Goldman Sachs
earns on non-computerized trades, the person said. </p>
<p>BlackRock, based in New York, said on April 12 that it was
creating Aladdin Trading Network to lower trading costs for
customers. BlackRock is awaiting approval from the Securities
and Exchange Commission for its platform. Brian Beades, a
spokesman for BlackRock in New York, declined to comment. </p>
<p>MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (MKTX)''s electronic trading system for
U.S. and European investment-grade, emerging markets and other
types of bonds said last month that it had a record $58.7
billion of transactions during March. Other electronic trading
systems for fixed income include Tradeweb Markets LLC and
Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News, which also
provides news and information to the financial community. </p>

<p>Ever wonder what the Incredible Hulk
smells like? Try Indian sandalwood, musk and sharp cedar. </p>
<p>It''s more of an earthy fragrance, said Andrew Levine,
chief executive officer of Jads International LLC, the Hunt
Valley, Maryland-based marketer that signed on to produce a line
of Avengers scents, including Smash, a cologne based on the
green superhero. You have to mimic the character. </p>
<p>Dozens of companies are tying in with Marvel''s The
Avengers, the Walt Disney Co. (DIS) action film opening today in the
U.S. With its Captain America character dating back to World War
II, The Avengers has an unusually broad appeal, attracting
licensing and sponsorship deals that go well beyond toys,
including ones for hotels, fragrances and luxury cars. </p>
<p>Searching for revenue beyond the box office has been a big
part of the strategy at Disney, where the Marvel division
generated $6 billion in retail merchandise sales last year,
according to License! Global magazine. Disney''s consumer
products division produced operating income of $816 million in
2011, more than the $618 million brought in by the company''s
original business, its film studio. </p>
<p>The superhero transcends age, gender and ethnicity,
said Robin Korman, head of loyalty marketing at hotelier Wyndham
Worldwide Corp. (WYN), which is offering a ticket giveaway for guests.
It really is one of those genres that''s universally
embraced. </p>
<p>The film features cars from Acura, Honda Motor Co.''s luxury
division, including customized versions of the MDX sport-utility
vehicle, which starts at $43,000, and an NSX concept car driven
by Robert Downey Jr.''s Iron Man Tony Stark. The picture also
includes Harley-Davidson Inc. (HOG)''s $15,500 FLS Softail Slim
motorcycle, the ride of choice for Captain America, played by
30-year-old Chris Evans. </p>
<h2>Generations of Fans </h2>
<p>Wyndham, based in Parsippany, New Jersey, made collectible
room key-cards and commissioned 400,000 copies of a comic book
from Disney''s Marvel division to distribute free at its
properties. The comic features Avengers characters including
Iron Man and the Black Widow enjoying loyalty program perks such
as free rooms and Internet access. The Hulk works out in a
fitness center. </p>
<p>Please don''t blow up any of our hotels, Korman asked
Marvel''s illustrators. </p>
<p>Avengers fans include men age 35 and older, with median
household incomes that exceed $75,000, making them target buyers
for Harleys, said Dino Bernacchi, director of North American
marketing communication for the Milwaukee-based company. </p>
<h2>Likely Bikers </h2>
<p>The Avengers characters, including Captain America and
Thor, have decades of history and have sold millions of comic
books, Bernacchi said. </p>
<p>They have a built-in fan base hungry to see this concept
come to life, Bernacchi said, adding they are 22 percent
more likely to purchase a motorcycle. </p>
<p>Sales of movie-related toys, gadgets and apparel can exceed
film receipts, Jay Rasulo, chief financial officer of Burbank,
California-based Disney said last year. The company, which
didn''t respond to requests for interviews, is scheduled to
report fiscal second-quarter earnings on May 8. </p>
<p>Disney rose 0.6 percent to $43.81 yesterday in New York.
The stock has gained 17 percent this year, placing seventh among
the 16 stocks in the SP 500 Media Index. (S5MEDA) Discovery
Communications Inc. (DISCA), up 35 percent, is first. </p>
<h2>Hasbro Sales </h2>
<p>Marvel-related toys, such as Thor hammers and Hulk fists,
are expected to generate a record $400 million in revenue this
year for licensee Hasbro Inc. (HAS), according to Drew Crum, an
analyst at Stifel Nicolaus  Co. </p>
<p>We expect Disney to push the Marvel franchise more
aggressively across international markets, Crum wrote in an
April 27 report. </p>
<p>The Avengers is the first Marvel film Disney has
marketed since purchasing the business for $4.2 billion in 2009.
The movie has broken international box office records, grossing
more than $281 million overseas as of May 2, Disney said in a
release. </p>
<p>Levine, the cologne maker, said the response has been
phenomenal to his line of Avengers scents, which retail
for $29.99 a bottle and target customers 16 years and older. </p>
<p>It''s all about being a hero, he said. People want to be
part of something good. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE)''s Lipitor, the cholesterol
pill that generated about $10.7 billion in sales for the world''s

this weekend, the Times reported. </p>
<p>Generic drugs companies can begin to copy the New York-

marketing exclusivity in the U.S. in November and Pfizer
reported this month that first-quarter profit fell 19 percent
after revenue from the drug declined because of generic
competition. </p>
