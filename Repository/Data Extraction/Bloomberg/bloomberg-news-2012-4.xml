&lt;p&gt;Diageo Plc (DGE), the world&#8217;s largest
liquor maker, appointed Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA) for advice on gaining control of Jose Cuervo from
family owners, people familiar with the plans said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuervo, owned by Mexico&#8217;s Beckmann family, is expected to
be valued at more than $3 billion and family sellers may gain
cash or shares in Diageo as part of the deal, said the people,
who declined to be identified because the talks are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diageo, the maker of Johnnie Walker Scotch and Smirnoff
vodka, has an option to buy the company because of its
international distribution rights to the Cuervo brand, a person
with knowledge of the discussions said in May. Diageo&#8217;s
agreement to distribute Cuervo in countries outside Mexico
expires in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussions between Diageo and Beckmann family members may
not lead to a deal because it&#8217;s unclear whether all of the
family members are committed to a process, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Diageo declined to comment, as did
spokesmen for Goldman and HSBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diageo, based in London, is pushing into emerging markets
and last year acquired Turkey&#8217;s Mey Icki to add the country&#8217;s
largest maker of Raki liquor for about $2.1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supply, notably around the agave plant used to make
tequila, are among issues being discussed, one of the people
said. A competitor, Brown-Forman Corp. (BF/A), in 2007 gained agave
plants through the purchase of Mexico&#8217;s Grupo Industrial
Herradura SA, maker of Herradura and El Jimador tequilas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Agave &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown-Forman in 2008 wrote down the value of dead agave
plants, used to make tequila, due to weather, insects and
disease, a spokesman said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Walsh, Diageo&#8217;s chief executive officer, said in an
interview with the Wall Street Journal on March 26 that he
&#8220;wouldn&#8217;t take anything less than control, or a route to
control,&#8221; when asked about Cuervo. Walsh has previously said
Diageo wouldn&#8217;t distribute the brand under the same terms after
the agreement lapses, and would seek a more lucrative agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of Jose Cuervo works out to about $3.1 billion,
Melissa Earlam, an analyst at UBS AG in London, wrote in a note
published on March 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An all-stock deal would be mostly neutral to Diageo&#8217;s
earnings per share in the second year, while a cash deal would
be about 3 percent accretive to EPS, the report shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuervo is a global leader in tequila with 19 percent volume
share, twice the size of Sauza, the No. 2 player owned by
Fortune Brands Inc., according to the UBS report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sunday Telegraph earlier reported Diageo hired Goldman
to finalize talks with Jose Cuervo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuervo is using Barclays Capital to explore options and
negotiate a potential sale, people familiar with the matter said
in May. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PetroChina Co. surpassed global
rivals Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and OAO Rosneft to become the biggest
oil producer among publicly traded companies last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CHART OF THE DAY shows crude output by PetroChina
compared with production of the world&#8217;s largest listed energy
companies, in million barrels a day, based on Bloomberg
calculations from company statements. The lower panel tracks
Beijing-based PetroChina&#8217;s quarterly net income in million yuan,
including the final three months of 2011 reported on March 29. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PetroChina plans &#8220;large scale&#8221; acquisitions to secure
more oil and natural gas to help fuel the world&#8217;s second-biggest
economy, Chairman Jiang Jiemin told reporters after the earnings
report. The Hong Kong-listed company aims to spend at least $60
billion on global assets this decade to boost the share of
overseas output to half of total production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There isn&#8217;t enough organic growth that can support such a
growth, so PetroChina has to acquire the capacity through major
acquisitions,&#8221; said Neil Beveridge, a senior analyst at Sanford
C. Bernstein  Co. in Hong Kong. For PetroChina to reach its
overseas production goal, Beveridge said the company needs to
add capacity equivalent to that of Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), which
produced a combined 3.2 million barrels a day of oil and gas
last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PetroChina&#8217;s oil and gas production outside China rose 18
percent last year, five times faster than that of domestic
fields, data from the company&#8217;s earnings statement show.
Overseas output climbed to 120.8 million barrels, less than a
tenth of the total of 1.3 billion barrels, or 3.5 million
barrels a day of oil and gas. Based on both crude and gas, Exxon
Chairman Rex Tillerson said on a teleconference March 8 that his
company remains the biggest listed producer at 4.5 million
barrels equivalent a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While PetroChina has emerged as the top publicly traded oil
producer, the company still has &#8220;huge&#8221; potential to expand its
output, Jiang said. Unlisted Saudi Arabian Oil Co. produces
almost 10 million barrels a day of crude. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is leading a
group bidding for Edinburgh airport, the Sunday Times reported,
without saying how it obtained the information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Korea&#8217;s Incheon International Airport Corp. and TIAA-CREF
have joined JPMorgan in the bid to buy the airport, the
newspaper said. The group is competing with Global
Infrastructure Partners Ltd., the Sunday Times said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, named James J. Schiro to succeed
John H. Bryan as lead independent director, tapping an executive
with accounting and insurance experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bryan, the second-longest serving director, won&#8217;t run for
re-election at the annual meeting after reaching the board&#8217;s
retirement age of 75, the company said yesterday in a statement.
Lois D. Juliber, 64, who joined the board in March 2004, also is
stepping down at the annual meeting, leaving the firm with 10
directors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd C. Blankfein, in February staved off a shareholder
proposal to split his roles by agreeing to appoint an
independent board member as &#8220;lead director.&#8221; Brooklyn-born
Schiro, who joined the board in 2009, is the former CEO of
Zurich Financial Services AG (ZURN), Switzerland&#8217;s biggest insurer, and
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That background is helpful,&#8221; said Eleanor Bloxham, CEO
of Value Alliance Co., a board advisory firm in Westerville,
Ohio. &#8220;One of the things they really need to think about for
this board is the level of expertise in the financial
industry.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PwC, one of the world&#8217;s four biggest accounting firms, has
been Goldman Sachs&#8217;s auditor since before the firm went public
in 1999, according to David Wells, a bank spokesman in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) is honoring its
oil exploration contracts in the semi-autonomous Kurdistan
region of northern Iraq, the Kurdish minister for natural
resources said in disputing a report from Iraq&#8217;s government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil, the world&#8217;s largest energy company, hasn&#8217;t
halted the agreements in Kurdistan, Ashti Hawrami, the natural
resources minister, said yesterday in an interview in
Washington. Iraq&#8217;s oil minister said Exxon Mobil confirmed in a
letter April 1 that it has frozen its contracts with Kurdistan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What comes out of Baghdad is about 90 percent, with
respect, rubbish,&#8221; Hawrami said yesterday. The regional
government hears from Exxon Mobil on an &#8220;almost daily basis,&#8221;
as the Irving, Texas-based company is &#8220;committed&#8221; to all its
contracts in the region, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tension between Iraq&#8217;s government and Kurdistan&#8217;s
leadership is mounting as the U.S. seeks to encourage a unified
Iraq after withdrawing troops at the end of December. Hawrami is
part of a delegation to the U.S. led by Kurdistan President
Massoud Barzani, who is scheduled to meet with Vice President
Joe Biden this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Jeffers, an Exxon Mobil spokesman, said the company
didn&#8217;t have any comment regarding contracts in Kurdistan. The
government in Baghdad refuses to do business with companies
working in the Kurdish region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Halted Exports &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relations between the Kurds and Iraq&#8217;s government soured
April 1 when the Kurdistan Regional Government, which exports
crude using a pipeline controlled by Iraq, stopped deliveries.
The Kurdish Ministry of Natural Resources said Iraq failed to
pay about $1.5 billion owed to oil producers since May 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dispute over oil revenues between Iraq&#8217;s government and
Kurdish authorities led to a yearlong halt in exports from the
region that ended in February 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq holds the world&#8217;s fifth-biggest reserves of crude,
based on statistics from London-based BP Plc (BP/), and it is seeking
to boost shipments to rebuild an economy recovering after years
of conflict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a loss for Iraq if they continue with this madness
of this policy,&#8221; Hawrami said in the interview. &#8220;It has to be
resolved in a few weeks and months ahead.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the Kurds will resume the shipments when they get
&#8220;clear understanding&#8221; that Iraq will pay for the oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kurdish region is producing about 100,000 barrels of
oil a day after cutting off the shipments, with most of the
product refined and consumed locally, Hawrami said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trucked Through Iraq &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some refined product is trucked through neighboring Iran
because there aren&#8217;t other routes &#8220;at the moment,&#8221; Hawrami
said. Iran is used only for transit and the government doesn&#8217;t
sell to Iran, he said. It&#8217;s unclear whether the shipments to
Iran&#8217;s ports breach economic and financial sanctions imposed by
the U.S. and European allies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq asked Iran and Turkey to curb oil smuggling from
Kurdistan across their territories, Iraqi Oil Minister Abdul Kareem al-Luaibi told a news conference yesterday in Baghdad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the crude smuggled by tanker from Kurdistan is sold
at lower prices to other nations at Iran&#8217;s port of Bandar Abbas,
he said. &#8220;We have indications and detailed reports with numbers
about crude smuggling to Iran,&#8221; Luaibi said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq only exports crude through government terminals and
&#8220;doesn&#8217;t know where the money from the oil smuggling in
Kurdistan is going,&#8221; he said. Kurdistan produced 68.11 million
barrels of oil last year, of which 33.64 million weren&#8217;t shipped
via official channels, Luaibi said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq&#8217;s crude exports in March rose to 71.83 million
barrels, or 2.32 million a day, the most since 1980, Asim Jihad,
a spokesman for the Iraq Oil Ministry, said. The exports
generated $8.475 billion, with an average price of $118 a
barrel, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawrami said the regional government is &#8220;not in the
business&#8221; of breaking any laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kurdistan government is seeking contractors to build a
crude-oil pipeline from Kurdistan through Turkey, Hawrami said.
Construction would start this year and be complete by late 2013,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potential downgrades of banks
including Morgan Stanley (MS) and UBS AG, which could have their
credit ratings cut by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service to the lowest
level ever, threaten to shake up Wall Street&#8217;s balance of power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley and UBS may be lowered three grades, Moody&#8217;s
said Feb. 15, and Citigroup Inc. (C) and Bank of America Corp. could
join Morgan Stanley at Baa2, two levels above junk. The cuts
would raise funding and collateral costs, making the lowest-
rated firms less desirable counterparties in over-the-counter
derivatives trades, according to analysts and executives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That may push more business to JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and
Deutsche Bank AG, which would be the highest-rated firms among
the top nine global investment banks if Moody&#8217;s goes through
with its maximum reductions. Those two firms already have the
highest market share in fixed-income trading and had the biggest
gains in share last year as investors grappled with fears about
global contagion from Europe&#8217;s debt crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The winners are JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, who
relatively will have stronger ratings, and the losers will be
Citi, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley,&#8221; said Brad Hintz, an
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in New York and a former
treasurer at Morgan Stanley. &#8220;Lower ratings hurt the
willingness of players to take my name as a derivatives
counterparty, and it is in derivatives where I get some of the
highest-margin businesses in fixed income.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4), Brazil&#8217;s
state-controlled oil producer, may be liable for 30 percent of
any damages Chevron Corp. (CVX) must pay in relation to a November
spill off Rio de Janeiro&#8217;s coast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $11 billion claim last year against Chevron and
Transocean Ltd. (RIG), the operator of the drilling rig, by a federal
prosecutor in Brazil is &#8220;unreasonable,&#8221; Petrobras said in the
March 30 regulatory filing warning of its potential liability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legal action against Chevron comes as Brazil increases
scrutiny of offshore oil production following the 2010 Macondo
spill in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Chevron is also battling a
separate lawsuit by the country&#8217;s main oil union to ban it and
Transocean from operating in the country. Petrobras has a 30
percent stake in the Frade project where the estimated 3,000
barrels of oil spilled into the Atlantic Ocean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Brazilian government is going to come down with some
significant penalties even for minor accidents, there are indeed
some very draconian measures that are being implemented,&#8221;
Gianna Bern, president of Chicago-based risk-management adviser
Brookshire Advisory, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron holds a 52 percent stake in Frade and is the
operator. Partners include Petrobras and Frade Japao Petroleo
Ltda. -- a joint venture of INPEX Corp. (1605), Sojitz Corp. (2768) and Japan
Oil, Gas and Metals National Corp. -- with 18.26 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petrobras fell 0.5 percent to 23.23 reais in Sao Paulo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutor Eduardo Santos, who&#8217;s probing the slick
independently from the country&#8217;s oil regulator, charged 17
executives at Chevron and Transocean with environmental crimes
and called for prison sentences of as many as 31 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron took out full-page advertisements in several
Brazilian newspapers March 29 to say the Frade leak hasn&#8217;t
caused environmental damage. The company said the criminal
charges against its executives are unfounded. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bryan, 75, won&#8217;t stand for re-election in accordance with
the firm&#8217;s retirement policy, Goldman Sachs said. Juliber also

commitments associated with her other activities,&#8221; it said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) was sued by DZ
Bank (DZBK), Germany&#8217;s largest cooperative lender, over allegations the
bank made false and misleading statements in selling residential
mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed March 30, seeks about $402 million in
damages, according to a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint was the second filed this year by DZ Bank
against JPMorgan in New York state Supreme Court over the
investments, pools of home loans securitized into bonds that
were a central part of the housing bubble that helped send the
U.S. into the biggest recession since the 1930s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DZ Bank sued New York-based JPMorgan on Jan. 31, saying it
bought $85 million worth of the securities based on flawed
offering materials. It sued HSBC Holdings Plc, Europe&#8217;s biggest
bank, the next day over $122 million worth of the investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Deutsche Zentral Genossenschaftsbank AG v.
JPMorgan Chase  Co., 651021/2012, New York State Supreme Court
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Matthew Leising" date="Apr 02, 2012 12:33 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-02/jpmorgan-tightens-grip-on-bonds-as-sales-surge-credit-markets.html"><headline>JPMorgan Tightens Grip on Bonds as Sales Surge: Credit Markets</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is tightening
its grip on the global corporate bond market, taking share from
Citigroup Inc. (C) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and topping all
underwriters as companies sold a record $1.17 trillion of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most profitable U.S. bank&#8217;s underwrote 7.1 percent of
all bond sales in the three months ended March 31, up from 6.5
percent in 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Citigroup
moved up two spots to second with 5.7 percent, the same amount
it captured last year. Bank of America dropped to third with 5.6
percent, down from 6.1 percent in 2011. Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), which
dropped to fourth from third, handled 5.5, down from 5.9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is leading banks reaping the benefits of a Federal
Reserve outlook that benchmark interest rates will hold near
zero until at least late 2014 and an easing in Europe&#8217;s debt
crisis that has bolstered confidence that default rates will
stay below the historical averages. Increased demand for higher-
yielding assets is allowing companies from Australia to
Amsterdam to borrow at record-low rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A real positive outcome on Europe kicked the market into
high gear,&#8221; said Richard Zogheb, co-head of capital markets
origination for the Americas at Citigroup in New York. He cited
European Central Bank&#8217;s unlimited three-year loans to the
region&#8217;s lenders and a restructuring of Greece&#8217;s debt as
reassuring bondholders. &#8220;Investor demand has been incredibly
strong,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Record Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average bond yield for companies from the neediest to
the most creditworthy is 0.15 percentage point from the record
low 3.99 percent reached in October 2010, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch&#8217;s Global Broad Market Corporate  High
Yield Index. Yields fell to 4.14 percent on March 30 from 4.17
percent a week earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate debt sales at a record start to the year are
making underwriting one bright spot for Wall Street earnings.
Mergers and acquisitions in the quarter fell about 14 percent
from the fourth quarter, making it the slowest three-month
period in 2 1/2 years, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. banks will probably post a 10 percent
decline in first-quarter fixed-income trading revenue from a
year earlier and an 8 percent decline in equities trading, Keith Horowitz, a Citigroup bank analyst, said in a March 29 note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shrinking Spreads &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in credit markets, benchmark gauges of corporate
credit risk in the U.S. and Europe fell for a second day as
manufacturing in the world&#8217;s biggest economy expanded at a
faster pace in March. Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. (HIG),
the insurer being pressured by investor John Paulson to break
up, will pay about $2.43 billion to buy back debt and warrants
issued to Allianz SE. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ambac Assurance Corp. sued JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM), accusing the company&#8217;s EMC Mortgage and Bear
Stearns units of fraud and breach of contract over the sale of
mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit is the second filed in New York State Supreme
by the insurer against JPMorgan Chase  Co. over the
investments, a central part of the housing bubble that helped
push the U.S. into the biggest recession since the 1930s. Ambac
sued the New York-based bank in February 2011, claiming it was
fraudulently induced to participate in the investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The securitization transaction and loans at issue in this
action are different, but the story is the same,&#8221; lawyers for
Ambac said in the most recent lawsuit, filed on March 30. &#8220;The
loans involved in the transactions at issue in this case are
plagued by the same pervasive defects found in the transactions
at issue in Ambac&#8217;s original action against Bear Stearns.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bond insurer said in the lawsuit that it has had to pay
more than $200 million in claims as of Feb. 29 because of the
failed investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambac Assurance was the second-largest bond insurer before
the 2008 financial crisis, when mounting defaults on mortgages
swamped the company with claims. It guaranteed about $256
billion of $1.4 trillion in insured municipal debt, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A U.S. bankruptcy judge in Manhattan on March 15 approved a
plan to reorganize the $1.7 billion in debt of New York-based
Ambac Financial Group Inc. (ABKFQ), the bankrupt holding company for
Ambac Assurance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EMC Mortgage was a unit of Bear Stearns Cos. until the
investment bank was bought by JPMorgan in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Ambac Assurance v. EMC Mortgage, 651013/2012
and 650421/2011, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said Motorola
Mobility Holdings Inc. (MMI) demanded $4 billion a year in patent
royalties for use of technology critical to functioning of the
Xbox video-gaming system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Motorola&#8217;s demand was so over-reaching that no rational
company could ever have accepted it or even viewed it as a
legitimate offer,&#8221; Microsoft said in a March 30 filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both companies want a federal judge in Seattle to rule
whether Libertyville, Illinois-based Motorola Mobility broke its
promise to license patents essential to comply with industry
standards on wireless networking and video coding on fair and
non-discriminatory terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is part of a broader dispute in which Motorola
Mobility is seeking to block sales of the Xbox, and Microsoft
wants a ban on U.S. imports of Motorola Mobility phones that run
on Google Inc.&#8217;s Android operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said Motorola Mobility is seeking $4 billion a
year for licensing 50 patents on video compression. The
entertainment division of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft
generated $8.9 billion in sales last year. Microsoft&#8217;s total
revenue was $69.9 billion in the fiscal year that ended June 30,
2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software maker said it pays $6.5 million a year to a
group of 29 companies with 2,339 patents that cover the same
industry standard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Standard Offer &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility contends that the licensing offer made in
October 2010 -- a 2.25 percent royalty on the total value of a
product -- was the same one it has presented to every company
over the past decade as a starting point for negotiations.
Instead, Microsoft filed the breach of contract suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft did not write back to Motorola,&#8221; Motorola
Mobility said in its own March 30 filing &#8220;Microsoft did not
call Motorola to discuss the letters or any issues it had with
the offers. Microsoft did not apply for a license.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft had never licensed the technology, and Motorola
never pushed it, because the two worked together to develop
phones that used Microsoft&#8217;s operating systems. The relationship
strained when the Microsoft platform failed to gain market share
and Motorola Mobility turned to Android, Motorola Mobility said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court filings were earlier reported by the Foss Patents
blog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also has asked the court to prevent Motorola
Mobility from obtaining a ruling in Germany that would limit
sales of Microsoft products in that country. Today, Microsoft
said it was moving its European logistics center out of Germany,
to the Netherlands, because of the patent fight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Apple Inc., which has its own patent battles
with Motorola Mobility, have both filed complaints with the
European Union accusing the handset maker of misusing its
patents on standard-essential technology &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. case is Microsoft Corp. v. Motorola Inc.,
10cv1823, U.S. District Court for the District of Washington
(Seattle). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) has partnered with a team building the world&#8217;s largest
radio telescope to develop super computer systems to make sense
of light years of space data and the history of the universe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy, known as
ASTRON, and IBM will collaborate to research so-called exascale
computers that consume little power. The technology will be
needed to study faint radio signals from deep space produced by
the &#8220;Big Bang&#8221; 13 billion years ago -- to be collected by the
Square Kilometre Array telescope when it&#8217;s completed in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The telescope will be used to explore evolving galaxies,
dark matter and even the very origins of the universe,&#8221; IBM and
ASTRON said in a statement. &#8220;Scientists estimate that the
processing power required to operate the telescope will be equal
to several millions of today&#8217;s fastest computers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial five-year, 32.9 million euro ($43.9 million)
&#8220;DOME project&#8221; in Drenthe, the Netherlands, will investigate
technologies necessary to read, store and analyze one exabyte of
raw data per day -- twice today&#8217;s entire daily Internet traffic.
IBM, the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider, is
advancing technologies that increase memory capacity and reduce
power consumption to process near-limitless data, to help
business and government clients analyze performance and project
trends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Futuristic Technology&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have to invent futuristic technology to look into the
past,&#8221; Ronald Luijten, IBM&#8217;s lead researcher on the project in
Zurich, Switzerland, said in an interview. &#8220;The energy issue is
becoming ubiquitous. We need fundamental new technologies to
deal with the needs of the future data centers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM rose 0.2 percent to $208.97 at 9:30 a.m. New York time.
The shares had gained 13 percent this year before today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1.5 billion euro telescope project is &#8220;comparable&#8221; in
size, cost and international participation to the Large Hadron
Collider developed by CERN, the European Organization for
Nuclear Research, Luijten said. The collider is looking for the
&#8220;same answers&#8221; as the telescope, by smashing protons together
inside its particle accelerator, creating what Luijten called
&#8220;mini Big Bangs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Construction of the super telescope will begin in 2017. It
will be positioned in Australia or South Africa where there is
enough space to accommodate 3,000 dishes -- one square
kilometers&#8217; worth of antenna positioned across a continent, that
make up the super telescope, Luijten said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, based in Armonk, New York, has partnered with
governments and universities in both potential host countries to
develop software that will filter out &#8220;the noise&#8221; the
telescope collects and create sky maps for astronomers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italian and Spanish banks may get a
revenue boost of as much as 11 billion euros ($14.7 billion)
over three years as they increase government debt holdings as
part of European Central Bank refinancing, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spanish and Italian banks acquired more than 104 billion
euros of notes from their own countries between December and
February after tapping the first three-year refinancing from the
ECB, Goldman Sachs analysts led by Jernej Omahen estimated in a
note today. &#8220;Ample additional liquidity should result in
continued sovereign-bond purchases&#8221; through the first half
after the ECB provided a second set of funds at the end of
February, the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French and German banks maintained &#8220;flat&#8221; holdings of
Italian and Spanish bonds, the analysts said. Spanish and
Italian banks have probably reaped 22 billion euros in capital
gains on bonds from their own countries, they said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yuan money markets are expanding in
Hong Kong as more banks quote interbank interest rates for the
currency, helping widen its use for trade and investment beyond
China&#8217;s borders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), ICBC (Asia) Ltd., Bank of
Communications (Hong Kong) Ltd., Bank of East Asia Ltd. and Bank
of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. started providing interbank rates
for yuan in Hong Kong today, according to Jack Cheung, chief
executive officer of the city&#8217;s Treasury Markets Association.
That brings to eight the number of lenders quoting prices. Bank
of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and Citigroup Inc. completed the first yuan
interest-rate swap involving the Hong Kong interbank rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a breakthrough,&#8221; said Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Hong
Kong-based strategist at Credit Agricole CIB. &#8220;In order for the
market to fully develop, you do need a swap curve. This will
allow more financial instruments like hedging for Dim Sum bonds
and benchmarks for loans to develop in the offshore yuan
market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need for benchmark lending rates in Hong Kong&#8217;s
offshore center for yuan is building as companies increasingly
turn to the city to obtain financing in China&#8217;s currency. The
city&#8217;s outstanding yuan-denominated loans totaled 30.8 billion
yuan ($4.9 billion) at the end of 2011, up from 1.8 billion yuan
at the start of the year, Hong Kong Monetary Authority data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of yuan-denominated bonds in Hong Kong, known as Dim
Sum bonds, almost tripled to 50.7 billion yuan in the first
quarter of this year from 18.6 billion yuan a year earlier,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Reputable Rate&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BOC Hong Kong (Holdings) Ltd., Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) and
HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) have been quoting interbank rates for offshore
yuan since January, though there&#8217;s no official daily fixing as
yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our committee is aware of the market expectations and the
need for an offshore interbank fixing,&#8221; TMA&#8217;s Cheung said in a
phone interview. &#8220;We want to make sure it&#8217;s a reputable rate
before we post it up.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and Citigroup Inc. agreed a one-
year interest-rate swap involving 100 million yuan, according to
two people with direct knowledge of the matter. Under the terms
reached, the Japanese lender will pay 2.45 percent in exchange
for the three-month interbank offered rate, which will be set
quarterly. Spokesmen at the banks declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pull the lever and watch the slot
machine spin apples, gold bars and lucky 7s. When the wheels
stop, you see 7 to the left, 7 to the right, and half a 7 in the
middle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you lose -- or did you almost win? If you&#8217;re addicted
to gambling, it&#8217;s a &#8220;near miss,&#8221; for sure. So you pop in
another coin and tug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a Wall Street trader, a slot player craves the mental
rush of winning. Yet all the while his brain is stuck in a rut,
as Charles Duhigg shows in &#8220;The Power of Habit,&#8221; a refreshing
exploration of how we form habits and how we can change them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Habits, good and bad, shape our lives every day, from the
first cup of coffee in the morning to the last sip of wine
before bed. Some are conscious, others not: Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) cultivates habits to curtail risk, while sleepwalkers
wracked with anxiety have killed their loved ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet research shows that habits are, at base, simple
neurological loops, says Duhigg, a New York Times reporter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loops have three steps. First there&#8217;s a cue that
triggers a craving: A smoker spots a pack of Marlboros, for
instance. Then comes a routine (lighting up), which brings a
reward (a hit of nicotine). Cue, routine, reward. Repeat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These loops get burned into the more primitive core of our
brains, where a golf-ball sized knob called the basal ganglia
stores our routines. The good news is that even pernicious
habits can be altered, if we understand how they work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) and Transocean Ltd (RIG) are
being sued for another 20 billion reais ($11 billion) by a
Brazilian federal prosecutor for a second oil spill at the Frade
project off the nation&#8217;s coast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron committed &#8220;a series of errors&#8221; that led to the
March spill at the project, the federal prosecutor&#8217;s office said
in an e-mailed statement today. Prosecutor Eduardo Santos is
also seeking to halt operations at Frade and block Chevron from
exporting profits from Brazil, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santos filed the first 20 billion-reais lawsuit last year
against San Ramon, California-based Chevron after a 3,000-barrel
spill in November. Santos filed criminal charges against Chevron
and Transocean executives last month, seeking penalties of as
much as 31 years in prison for environmental crimes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A drilling accident caused the November spill after Chevron
underestimated the amount of pressure at a reservoir where it
was drilling, causing oil to leak from the well to fissures on
the seabed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, Chevron reported new leaks on the seabed at the
project. Chevron has halted production at Frade as a
precautionary measure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mail and phone
call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transocean, which operated the drilling rig at Frade,
&#8220;acted responsibly, appropriately and quickly, putting safety
first,&#8221; Guy Cantwell, a spokesman for the Vernier, Switzerland-
based company, said in an e-mail. The crew &#8220;always
maintained control of the well and the rig&#8217;s equipment worked
perfectly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said one of
its private equity funds agreed to exit a 12-year-old stake in
Village Voice Media at a loss because the bank is uncomfortable
with the company&#8217;s direction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GS Capital Partners III, a $2.78 billion fund raised in
1998, invested $30 million in the alternative weekly newspaper
publisher in 2000, according to Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman
for New York-based Goldman Sachs. New Times Media Plc bought
Village Voice Media in 2006 and Goldman Sachs kept a 16 percent
stake, Raphael said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund will lose &#8220;most&#8221; of its original $30 million
investment after signing an agreement on March 30 to sell the
stake back to the company&#8217;s management, Raphael said. Goldman
Sachs relinquished its seat on Village Voice Media&#8217;s board in
2010 &#8220;as a result of being uncomfortable with the direction of
the company,&#8221; and the fund had sought to exit the investment
&#8220;for a long time,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs provided 18.5 percent of the capital in GS
Capital Partners III, Raphael said. She declined to comment on
the overall performance of the fund, which is in the process of
&#8220;harvesting&#8221; its investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backpage.com, a website owned by Village Voice Media,
accounts for about 70 percent of prostitution advertising among
five websites that carry such ads in the U.S., Nicholas D. Kristof, a New York Times columnist, reported on March 18,
citing data from media research and consulting company AIM
Group. It&#8217;s also a website used for human trafficking, he wrote,
citing the National Association of Attorneys General. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Adult Classifieds&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristof, in a separate April 1 column, reported that
Goldman Sachs sold its stake after he began inquiring about it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott Tobias, president and chief operating officer of
Village Voice Media, didn&#8217;t reply to a voicemail seeking
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Village Voice Media, in a March 21 blog post responding to
the earlier Kristof column, said that Backpage &#8220;dedicates
hundreds of staff to screen adult classifieds in order to keep
juveniles off the site and to work proactively with law
enforcement in their efforts to locate victims.&#8221; The firm said
it shares records with law enforcement and that some research
has shown Internet data is the best tool to combat trafficking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, is
part of a bipartisan group of senators calling for Backpage.com
to shut down its adult-services section. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) and Pfizer Inc.
sued Hikma (HIK) Pharmaceuticals Plc for planning to sell an
injectable blood-clot treatment that the drugmakers say
infringes a patent licensed by Glaxo for argatroban. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hikma, a London-based seller of generic and branded drugs,
won U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval on Jan. 5 to
introduce its own version of argatroban, according to the
complaint filed March 30 in federal court in Trenton, New
Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hikma plans to introduce its product &#8220;imminently,&#8221;
infringing a patent that expires in 2014, according to the
complaint. Glaxo, the U.K.&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, licenses the
patent in the U.S. and sublicenses it to New York-based Pfizer,
the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless a judge stops Hikma, Glaxo and Pfizer (PFE) &#8220;will suffer
substantial and irreparable injury,&#8221; according to the
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A representative of Hikma, Hana Ramadan, didn&#8217;t immediately
return an e-mail seeking comment on the lawsuit. Hikma, which
was founded in Amman, Jordan, in 1978, has said it relies on the
Middle East and North Africa for 61 percent of its revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Expand and Strengthen&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Argatroban will expand and strengthen our injectables
product line and will help to differentiate our product
portfolio in the U.S.,&#8221; Hikma Chief Executive Officer Mazen Darwazah said in a Jan. 9 statement announcing the FDA approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of argatroban injection totaled $130 million for the
12-month period ended in November, according to the Hikma
statement, which cites IMS Health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hikma&#8217;s argatroban injection is approved for treatment of
thrombosis in adult patients with heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia (HIT) and as an anticoagulant in patients at
risk of HIT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is GlaxoSmithKline v. Hikma Pharmaceutical Co.,
12-cv-1965, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey
(Trenton). The patent can be found on the docket. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby Joseph Cohen, the senior U.S.
investment strategist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said
investors are taking more risk by buying bonds at negative real
yields than by putting money in equities as the economy grows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are many investors who really are just so nervous
about equities,&#8221; she said in a radio interview today on
&#8220;Bloomberg Surveillance&#8221; with Tom Keene and Ken Prewitt. &#8220;The
long-term question is: Should they be more nervous about bonds
right now? That to me is riskier than the stock market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index (SPX) surged 29 percent through
yesterday from its 2011 low in October as economic data beat
economists&#8217; forecasts and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said he will keep interest rates low through at least
late 2014 to spur growth. Ten-year Treasuries are yielding about
2.17 percent, less than the 2.90 percent year-over-year increase
in American consumer prices in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. may be emerging as a main engine for global growth
as Europe slides into recession and China&#8217;s economy decelerates,
with optimism measured by the Bloomberg Comfort Index (COMFCOMF) near a
four-year high. Personal-consumption expenditures rose by the
most in seven months in February, the Commerce Department said
last week, while data today showed orders to U.S. factories
climbed in February for the third time in four months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;One of the things we are seeing in the economy is that
corporate spending on business equipment continues at a good
pace, and critically, they are also now hiring new workers,&#8221;
Cohen said before the factory-orders report. Speaking during a
separate interview on Bloomberg Television, she described U.S.
economic growth as &#8220;good, solid, steady.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities may extend gains this year because of cheap
valuations, fueled by a shift in risk aversion among investors,
Cohen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are talking the SP at 1,500 to 1,600,&#8221; she replied
when asked for a year-end forecast for the stock index. The
benchmark measure of U.S. equities closed at 1,419.04 yesterday.
David Kostin, the chief U.S. investment strategist at Goldman
Sachs, has a year-end projection of 1,250, according to a weekly
survey by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) sold $59.1
million in structured notes tied to a proprietary volatility
index in March, the most for any month since the gauge was
created more than a year and a half ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The J.P. Morgan Strategic Volatility Index, which uses a
strategy based on a set of rules, has increased 17 percent this
year. The gauge seeks gains when the market for longer-term
futures on the VIX trade higher than those with closer
expirations, which is referred to as &#8220;contango,&#8221; and also when
the reverse is true, called &#8220;backwardation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors have piled into investments that track the VIX,
as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index is known,
as volatility drops to multiyear lows. The number of shares
outstanding for 17 exchange-traded products that increase when
the VIX rises has jumped more than fivefold this year, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VIX has plummeted 64 percent in the last two quarters,
the most ever, Bloomberg data show. The gauge, which touched its
lowest level since June 2007 on March 26, gained 0.9 percent to
15.64 yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan sold $23.6 million in 15-month notes tied to its
proprietary gauge on March 13, the bank&#8217;s largest such sale,
according to Bloomberg data. The notes yield the gains and
losses in the index, according to a prospectus filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The New York-based bank
distributed the securities for a 1 percent commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mitigating Contango &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The volatility index, created July 30, 2010, is long on VIX
futures with a maturity of about two months, and short on those
of about one month, whenever the fear gauge is less than the
weighted average of one- and two-month contracts. Selling some
futures short, with an expectation of a price drop, is intended
to mitigate the problem of contango. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ETNs are unsecured bank debt backed by their issuer&#8217;s
credit, unlike exchange-traded funds, which hold assets. Banks
create and redeem shares of ETNs based on the level of demand
for the securities. That demand typically doesn&#8217;t affect the
price since the ETNs track the performance of an index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ian Hannam, one of JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM)&#8217;s top advisers to mining companies, stepped down to appeal a
450,000-pound ($720,000) fine from the U.K. markets regulator
for disclosing inside information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hannam, JPMorgan&#8217;s global chairman of equity capital
markets, e-mailed a potential customer in 2008 with details of a
bid for his client Heritage Oil Plc (HOIL), as well as news of an oil
find, the Financial Services Authority said in a statement
today. The 56-year-old is the most senior banker to be fined by
the FSA in its four-year-old crackdown on insider trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I strongly believe, and have been advised by my legal
counsel, that the FSA&#8217;s conclusions are wrong and I look forward
to challenging them,&#8221; London-based Hannam said in a separate
statement. &#8220;The FSA has not challenged my fit and proper status
and has accepted that I acted with honesty and integrity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is among bankers advising Xstrata Plc, the subject of a
bid from Glencore International Plc (GLEN). At JPMorgan, which also
serves as a broker to Xstrata, Hannam helped the mining company
first sell shares in 2002, and was involved in many of its
subsequent takeovers, including the $18.1 billion purchase of
the Canadian nickel producer Falconbridge Ltd. in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He has always acted with honesty and integrity,&#8221; Xstrata
Chief Executive Officer Mick Davis said in a statement today.
&#8220;He continues to have my full support in his appeal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Extremely Valuable&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the third-ranked mergers adviser in Europe this
year after Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In mining mergers, the
bank is placed second after Morgan Stanley, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm was the top-ranked arranger of equity offerings in
Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the five years through the
end of 2011, the data show. JPMorgan was also the top-ranked
manager of IPOs in the region in the period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Inside information is extremely valuable and must be
handled with care to ensure that it is properly controlled and
that appropriate safeguards are observed,&#8221; Tracey McDermott,
acting head of financial crime at the FSA, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator fined Andrew Osborne, a broker at Bank of
America Corp., 350,000 pounds in February for disclosing inside
information to Greenlight Capital Inc. Chairman David Einhorn.
Osborne told Einhorn the company was about to sell new stock,
prompting Einhorn to order traders to sell the firm&#8217;s shares
&#8221;within minutes,&#8221; according to the regulator. Osborne quit and
Einhorn and Greenlight were fined 7.2 million pounds by the FSA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Heritage Offer &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hannam will complete his current commitments before leaving
the bank, Emilio Saracho, the head of investment banking for
Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said in a memorandum to
employees today. Calls to Hannam&#8217;s mobile phone were referred to
JPMorgan&#8217;s press office. Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for the
firm in London, declined to comment beyond the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hannam sent an e-mail to an unidentified contact on Sept.
9, 2008, in which he said Heritage, a British oil and gas
exploration firm, would receive an offer valued at between 350
pence and 400 pence a share, according to the FSA. The stock
closed at 204 pence in London that day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recipient of the e-mail was a representative of an
organization that had interests in the Kurdistan region of Iraq,
an area where Heritage had exploration projects, the FSA said.
Nine days after the e-mail was sent, Heritage disclosed it was
in preliminary talks to sell some assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Looking Good&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a second e-mail a month later, Hannam told his contact
that Heritage &#8220;has just found oil and it is looking good.&#8221;
Jersey, U.K.-based Heritage announced a find later that month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No trades were made on the inside information, the FSA
said. The recipient of Hannam&#8217;s e-mail later hired him to set up
a fund for making investments in Kurdistan, the FSA said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hannam, a former soldier, graduated from Imperial College
London and London Business School, and trained at Salomon
Brothers. In 1992, he joined Robert Fleming  Co., which was
bought by Chase Manhattan in 2000. Four years later, he helped
to set up JPMorgan&#8217;s joint venture with London-based Cazenove
Group Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said Motorola
Mobility Holdings Inc. (MMI) demanded $4 billion a year in patent
royalties for use of technology critical to functioning of the
Xbox video-gaming system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Motorola&#8217;s demand was so over-reaching that no rational
company could ever have accepted it or even viewed it as a
legitimate offer,&#8221; Microsoft said in a March 30 filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both companies want a federal judge in Seattle to rule
whether Libertyville, Illinois-based Motorola Mobility broke its
promise to license patents essential to comply with industry
standards on wireless networking and video coding on fair and
non-discriminatory terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is part of a broader dispute in which Motorola
Mobility is seeking to block sales of the Xbox, and Microsoft
wants a ban on U.S. imports of Motorola Mobility phones that run
on Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Android operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said Motorola Mobility is seeking $4 billion a
year for licensing 50 patents on video compression. The
entertainment division of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft
generated $8.9 billion in sales last year. Microsoft&#8217;s total
revenue was $69.9 billion in the fiscal year that ended June 30,
2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software maker said it pays $6.5 million a year to a
group of 29 companies with 2,339 patents that cover the same
industry standard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility contends that the licensing offer made in
October 2010 -- a 2.25 percent royalty on the total value of a
product -- was the same one it has presented to every company
over the past decade as a starting point for negotiations.
Instead, Microsoft filed the breach of contract suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft had never licensed the technology, and Motorola
never pushed it, because the two worked together to develop
phones that used Microsoft&#8217;s operating systems. The relationship
strained when the Microsoft platform failed to gain market share
and Motorola Mobility turned to Android, Motorola Mobility said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Apple Inc. (AAPL), which has its own patent battles
with Motorola Mobility, have both filed complaints with the
European Union accusing the handset maker of misusing its
patents on standard-essential technology &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. case is Microsoft Corp. v. Motorola Inc.,
10cv1823, U.S. District Court for the District of Washington
(Seattle). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ECOJ Says Polish Generics Drugs Legislation Violates EU Law &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Court of Justice said Polish legislation
permitting the importation of unauthorized generic forms of
drugs already permitted in the market is contrary to European
Union law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a March 29 statement, the court said Poland&#8217;s use of
permitted &#8220;special needs&#8221; drug importation base only on lower
price isn&#8217;t justified. The &#8220;special needs exception&#8221; must be
interpreted strictly, &#8220;applicable in exceptional cases where it
is appropriate to meet special medical needs,&#8221; not for
financial considerations in themselves, the court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court said that the present harmonized marketing
authorization within the EU &#8220;enables cost-efficient and non-
discriminatory market access,&#8221; while ensuring that the
requirements of safeguarding public health are met. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oracle, Google Settlement Talks Over Java Patent Failed &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle Corp. (ORCL) and Google Inc. have reached an
&#8220;irreconcilable impasse&#8221; in settlement talks to resolve an
intellectual property dispute over the Java programming language
and their lawsuit should proceed to trial on April 16, a judge
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Magistrate Judge Paul Grewal in San Jose, California,
wrote in a filing yesterday that no further settlement
conferences will be scheduled. According to the court document,
the unfruitful negotiations went on for six hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle accused Google in a 2010 lawsuit of infringing
patents related to its Java software in the company&#8217;s Android
mobile software. With a settlement, the companies avoid the risk
of a jury deciding whether Google owes royalties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Oracle America Inc. v. Google Inc., 10-03561,
U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San
Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IPad Trademark Fight to Continue After China Court Ruling &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Chinese court rejected a creditor&#8217;s application to
liquidate Proview Technology (Shenzhen) Co., allowing the failed
display maker to pursue its legal fight against Apple Inc. over
the iPad trademark in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shenzhen Intermediate People&#8217;s Court ruled against
Fubon Insurance&#8217;s bid to liquidate Proview, Roger Xie, a lawyer
for Proview, said by phone yesterday. The decision was released
to litigants on March 31, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same Chinese court ruled in November that Proview owned
the iPad trademark in China, saying Apple&#8217;s 2009 contract to
acquire rights to the name was invalid. The Cupertino,
California-based company has appealed, and a decision is
expected within two months. Proview has filed separate
complaints alleging that Apple&#8217;s sale of iPad tablets in the
country infringed intellectual-property laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fubon Insurance, a unit of Taipei-based Fubon Financial
Holding Co. (2881), is assessing whether to take further action in the
case, according to an e-mailed statement yesterday. The
application for liquidating Proview was taken on behalf of
reinsurance partners, Fubon said March 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proview will continue its litigation with Apple, Xie said
yesterday. The action against Apple, the world&#8217;s most-valuable
company, might have been affected if Fubon&#8217;s application had
been granted, he said. The rejection was first reported by
China&#8217;s state-run Xinhua News Agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proview Technology, a unit of Hong Kong-listed Proview
International Holdings Ltd. (334), has filed complaints to more than
40 branches of the Administration for Industry and Commerce in
China, Ma Dongxiao, another company lawyer, said in February.
Court actions have been lodged in Shanghai, Shenzhen and
Huizhou, Ma said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple has said it bought the rights to the iPad trademark
in China from Proview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim Tebow&#8217;s Fans Seek to Register &#8216;Timsanity&#8217; as U.S. Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First came &#8220;Linsanity,&#8221; the coined word associated with
Jeremy Lin of the New York Knicks National Basketball
Association team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it&#8217;s &#8220;Timsanity,&#8221; associated with quarterback Tim
Tebow, who was traded to the New York Jets National Football
League team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers representing Lin sent cease-and-desist letters to
several applicants not connected to the basketball player who
tried to register &#8220;Linsanity&#8221; as a trademark. Lin&#8217;s lawyer,
Pamela Deese of Washington&#8217;s Arent Fox LLP (1377L), told the Huffington
Post that applicants&#8217; enthusiasm for the player &#8220;got ahead of
their understanding of the law.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office, three applications have been filed to register
&#8220;Timsanity&#8221; as a trademark. The applications were filed March
21 and 22, shortly after Heisman Trophy winner Tebow signed with
the Jets March 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian Perez of Astoria, New York, filed an application
March 22 to register the term for use on clothing. LifeNatural
Corp. of Cheyenne, Wyoming, filed an application one day
earlier, also for use with clothing. Frank deGrimm of New York
City also filed a March 21 application to use the mark on
clothing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmer Says &#8216;Casino&#8217; Mark Registered Only to Stop Others&#8217; Use &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although he registered &#8220;Coolum Casino&#8221; as a trademark,
the billionaire owner of the Australia&#8217;s Coolum Resort  Spa
denied he plans to establish a casino, the Australian newspaper
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clive Palmer said in a statement that he hadn&#8217;t discussed
establishing a casino &#8220;with any authorities or the Queensland
government,&#8221; according to the Australian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmer, who is known as the richest man in the Queensland
region, paid an undisclosed amount to Hyatt Hotels Corp. to
remove the hotel company as Coolum Resort  Spa&#8217;s manager, the
Australian reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although he registered the www.coolumcasino.com.au domain
name, to stop others from grabbing it, Palmer said a casino
could have a &#8220;detrimental social effect&#8221; on the region,
according to the Australian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mike Ashley of Newcastle United Wins &#8216;Sports Direct&#8217; Dispute &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owner of the Premier Football League&#8217;s Newcastle United
team prevailed in a trademark dispute over the name of his
sportswear company &#8220;Sports Direct,&#8221; the U.K.&#8217;s Shields Gazette
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike Ashley&#8217;s Sports Direct International (SPD) became the target
of a trademark infringement action by a husband-and-wife team
that claimed it had used the name for their company -- Sport
Direct Ltd. -- since 2005, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hearing officer at the U.K.&#8217;s Intellectual Property
Office made a determination that Ashley&#8217;s company had used
&#8220;Sports Direct&#8221; long before the complaining company was named,
and rejected all claims, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashley based the &#8220;Sports Direct&#8221; name on &#8220;Viking
Direct,&#8221; a stationery firm he founded, according to the Shields
Gazette. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chicago Judge Rejects Conspiracy Claim in BitTorrent Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In six consolidated copyright cases brought by adult
filmmakers against unnamed defendants, a federal judge in
Chicago has rejected their argument that the sharing of content
through the BitTorrent file-sharing protocol fits within federal
law&#8217;s definition of conspiracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his March 30 order, U.S. District Judge James E.
Holderman said the plaintiffs claims of a civil conspiracy are
&#8220;unfounded.&#8221; He said the filmmakers had failed to argue that
an agreement existed among the alleged conspirators and that it
was implausible that they successfully could plead that a
conspiracy existed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He called the conspiracy allegations &#8220;unjustified
attempts&#8221; to bolster their efforts to get more irrelevant
information about those who aren&#8217;t even parties to the cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data would help the filmmakers either sue or try to
negotiate a settlement with these new potential defendants, he
said. He noted that federal case law holds that &#8220;when the
purpose of a discovery request is to gather information for use
in proceedings other than the pending suit,&#8221; discovery is
denied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Pacific Century International Ltd. V. Does 1-
37, 1:12-cv-01057, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
Illinois (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baker  McKenzie Adds Former Torys&#8217; Partner to Toronto IP Group &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baker  McKenzie LLP (1111L) hired Kamleh Nicola for its IP
practice, the international law firm said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicola, a litigator, has represented clients in Canadian

&lt;p&gt;Yahoo Japan Corp. (4689), operator of the
country&#8217;s most-visited web portal, fell the most in more than
six weeks in Tokyo trading after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
reiterated its sell rating on the shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo Japan declined 2.8 percent, the most since Feb. 15,
to 25,890 yen as of the 3 p.m. close on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange. Japan&#8217;s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average dropped 0.6
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s dominance may wane as more consumers use
smartphones to surf the Internet instead of personal computers,
decreasing the importance of portal sites, Takayoshi Koike and
Masaru Sugiyama, Tokyo-based analysts at Goldman Sachs, said in
a report yesterday. Yahoo Japan also fell as Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)
shareholder Third Point LLC unveiled a website that calls for
changes at the U.S. Internet company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Goldman report triggered the drop today,&#8221; Mitsuo
Shimizu, a Tokyo-based analyst at Cosmo Securities Co., said by
phone today. &#8220;The dispute in the U.S. also discourages Yahoo
Japan investors as it may affect its disposal talks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo is in talks to dispose of
its stake of about 34.7 percent in Yahoo Japan, a joint venture
with Softbank Corp. (9984), the companies have said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third Point, the owner of about 5.8 percent of Yahoo Inc.,
announced plans last month to seek shareholder votes on a
proposed slate of four Yahoo directors. The company has unveiled
a website that includes a blog, biographies of director nominees
and a critique of Yahoo&#8217;s past mistakes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo Japan, whose profit has increased every fiscal year
since it was founded in 1996, plans to accelerate development of
mobile-device applications as the number of smartphone users
rises, Manabu Miyasaka, who became chief executive officer April
1, said last week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
and most profitable U.S. bank, could reap as much as $24 billion
in annual profit without losses on home loans, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The main difference between what we are earning and what
we should be earning continues to be high costs and losses in
mortgage and mortgage-related issues,&#8221; Dimon, 56, said in a
letter to shareholders released today. While mortgage losses
have abated, they will &#8220;persist at elevated levels for a while
longer,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan faces higher litigation costs from its lending and
mortgage-bond business, even after settling some bigger cases in
the past year. The New York-based company earned a record $19
billion last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lender agreed in February to pay $5.3 billion as part
of a $25 billion industrywide settlement with state and federal
officials over abusive foreclosure practices. JPMorgan also
agreed in June to pay $56 million and to reduce mortgage rates
for deployed military personnel to settle claims that it
overcharged active-duty soldiers and seized the homes of those
protected by the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider, bought a
20 percent stake in the technology unit of Brazilian billionaire
Eike Batista as it expands to emerging markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, as the Armonk, New York-based company is known, and
Batista&#8217;s SIX Automacao unit will set up a technology center to
serve customers in Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru, EBX Group
Co., the holding company for most of Batista&#8217;s assets, said
today in an e-mailed statement. IBM was also awarded a $1
billion contract to provide technology services to EBX for 10
years, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;IBM will contribute smarter industry solutions, providing
new products, software and services that complement SIX,&#8221; the
company said, without disclosing the stake&#8217;s purchase price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM Chief Executive Officer Virginia Rometty, who in
January became the first female CEO in the company&#8217;s 100-year
history, is pushing a five-year plan focusing on programs to
help businesses analyze and project trends, as well as in so-
called cloud computing. IBM has said it will boost its growth
markets unit, which includes faster growing economies like
Brazil, to 30 percent of sales by 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batista, Brazil&#8217;s richest person, is raising money to
develop his oil and mining businesses in Brazil and diversify
from commodities. The IBM agreement is Batista&#8217;s second deal in
10 days after an accord to sell a $2 billion stake in EBX to Abu
Dhabi&#8217;s Mubadala Development Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM dropped 1.7 percent to $206.05 at the close in New York
today, the lowest since March 23. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dimon&#8217;s base salary was raised to $1.5 million beginning in
March 2011 from $1 million and he received $17 million in
restricted stock and options for his performance in 2011, down
from $17.4 million the previous year, the New York-based company
said today in a proxy statement. His cash bonus was $4.5
million, down from $5 million in 2010, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan capped its second straight year of record profit
in 2011 with $19 billion in net income. The European sovereign-
debt crisis, mortgage losses and litigation weighed on the
company&#8217;s shares, which slumped 22 percent for the year --
beating the 25 percent drop by the 24-company KBW Bank Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, 56, received restricted shares valued at $12
million, according to the proxy. He also received options valued
at $5 million, based on the company&#8217;s calculations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CEO took a salary of $1 million for 2009 and gave up
bonuses that year and in 2008 after receiving $49.9 million in
total compensation for 2007. Dimon and his wife control almost
5.2 million shares valued at more than $209 million as of March
2, when his total holdings were last disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief
executive officer of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), said banks face
public ire after the economic slump and European debt crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The frustration with -- and hostility toward -- our
industry continues,&#8221; Dimon said today in a letter to
shareholders of New York-based JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank
by assets. &#8220;We have not retrenched. Just the opposite -- we
have stepped up.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG)
are being sued for $22 billion in environmental damages in
Brazil, double initial claims, after a federal prosecutor filed
a second lawsuit over oil spills off the nation&#8217;s coast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron committed &#8220;a series of errors&#8221; that led to the
March spill at Frade, the second incident at the offshore oil
project, the federal prosecutors&#8217; office said in a statement
yesterday. Prosecutor Eduardo Santos de Oliveira is also seeking
to halt operations at Frade and block San Ramon, California-
based Chevron from transferring profits from Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The oil spill at the Frade field hasn&#8217;t been contained,&#8221;
Oliveira said in the statement. &#8220;The damages to the environment
and to Brazil&#8217;s natural resources are incalculable at this
point.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A leak of 3,000 barrels of crude into the Atlantic Ocean
off Rio de Janeiro&#8217;s coast in November and a seep in March have
led to a slew of probes against Chevron and Transocean, which
operated the rig at Frade. Oliveira filed the first 20 billion-
real ($11 billion) lawsuit last year and pressed criminal
charges against executives of the two companies last month,
seeking penalties of as many as 31 years in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron fell 1.4 percent to $105.60 at the close in New
York. Transocean fell 3.3 percent to $51.87. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil risks discouraging other foreign oil companies from
investing in the country as it seeks to develop the largest oil
discoveries in the Americas since Mexico&#8217;s Cantarell find in
1976, Cleveland Jones, an oil specialist and geology professor
at Rio de Janeiro State University, said in a telephone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Scared&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Other companies must be scared, even if they&#8217;re 100
percent right, they can be crucified in public opinion,&#8221; Jones
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A drilling accident caused the November spill after Chevron
underestimated the amount of pressure at a reservoir, causing
oil to leak from the well to fissures on the seabed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, Chevron reported new leaks on the seabed at the
project. Chevron said on March 29 that about a barrel of oil
leaked from the seabed that month. Chevron is collecting the oil
in underwater traps and the incident hasn&#8217;t damaged marine life,
the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron will vigorously defend the company and its
employees,&#8221; Kurt Glaubitz, a spokesman, said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday. He called the charges &#8220;outrageous&#8221; and
&#8220;without merit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The 20 billion-real figure in both civil lawsuits is
arbitrary and has no legal and factual basis,&#8221; Glaubitz said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Safety First&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transocean &#8220;acted responsibly, appropriately and quickly,
putting safety first,&#8221; Guy Cantwell, a spokesman for the
Vernier, Switzerland-based company, said in an e-mail yesterday.
The crew &#8220;always maintained control of the well and the rig&#8217;s
equipment worked perfectly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oliveira also started a probe into the work by Brazil&#8217;s
federal environmental agency Ibama and oil regulator ANP to
monitor companies that explore the country&#8217;s offshore fields. He
will also investigate emergency and accident prevention plans at
all platforms operating in the Campos Basin, where about 90
percent of Brazil&#8217;s crude is produced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4), the country&#8217;s state-controlled oil
producer, may be liable for 30 percent of any damages Chevron
must pay at Frade because it has a stake in the project,
according to a March 30 regulatory filing. The $11 billion claim
filed last year was &#8220;unreasonable,&#8221; Petrobras, as the Rio de
Janeiro-based producer is known, said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petrobras didn&#8217;t respond to an e-mail and telephone call
seeking further comments on its exposure to damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Probes &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron holds a 52 percent stake in Frade and is the
operator. Partners include Petrobras and Frade Japao Petroleo
Ltda. -- a joint venture of INPEX Corp. (1605), Sojitz Corp. (2768) and Japan
Oil, Gas and Metals National Corp. -- with 18.26 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron also faces probes and fines from the ANP, Ibama and
Rio de Janeiro state&#8217;s environment secretariat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oliveira&#8217;s criminal charges against Chevron, Transocean and
17 of their top executives in Brazil on March 21 included a
request for them to surrender their passports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first lawsuit seeking damage payments, filed on Dec.
14, Oliveira asked for the suspension of all activities by
Chevron and Transocean in Brazil until a final ruling on the
case. Federal Judge Raffaele Felice Pirro rejected the request
on Feb. 28, arguing it would represent a punishment before the
companies had a chance to defend themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pirro&#8217;s decision preventing the suspension was upheld by a
federal appeals court on March 29, following prosecutor Gisele
Port&#8217;s questioning of the ruling three days earlier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) named Bryan Mix global head of loan trading, and Jonathan Meltzer and John Shaffer, co-heads of New York credit sales, following changes to
the bank&#8217;s leveraged finance group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mix, who is based in London, previously ran the Asia credit
business, according to Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the New
York-based firm. Meltzer was previously head of bank loan sales
in New York and Shaffer was head of high-yield and distressed
distribution groups in New York, said DuVally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes at the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets come
after the firm began restricting people working in the loan
sales and trading business from receiving private information,
such as corporate financial projections. Credit Suisse Group AG
and Bank of America Corp. have taken similar steps to block
private information reaching loan traders about companies that
have both bank debt and sell publicly listed high-yield bonds.
The move allows them to sell both types of credits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have been discussing for some time the transition of
the loan business from behind the wall to the public side with
the rest of the leveraged finance business,&#8221; Justin Gmelich,
global head of credit trading in New York, said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;We thought we could serve our clients better with
an integrated trading model.&#8221; Gmelich was named to this role
last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leveraged loans, those rated below BBB- by Standard 
Poor&#8217;s and less than Baa3 at Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, are
usually private and investors in this debt can have access to
material non-public information that buyers of high-yield bonds
can&#8217;t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Private to Public &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs joins other banks that have moved their loan
traders to the public side. Bank of America and RBC Capital
Markets combined their loan sales forces in 2011 to make one
point of contact for both new-issue and secondary sales. In
limited situations, when a company just has loans, salesmen may
see private information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At RBC, under the new structure, every salesmen will market
loans, high-yield and distressed debt for primary and secondary
markets. Credit Suisse&#8217;s U.S. loan sales and trading group also
will no longer receive private information on borrowers that
have both bank debt and public securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are moving their loan sales and trading operations to
the public side as collateralized loan obligations, which
usually only buy this debt, are losing their market share to
other investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shifting Buyer Base &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds and high-yield bond investors, who in 2007
represented only 27 percent of loan buyers, made up 40 percent
of the base in the third quarter of last year, according to the
Loan Syndications and Trading Association. The market share of
CLOs shrank to 38 percent from 57 percent in the same time
period, the New York-based trade group said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The decision to convert our bank loan business from
private to public was largely predicated on the fact that the
majority of our clients prefer access to a fully integrated
leverage finance business,&#8221; Thomas Cornacchia, Goldman Sachs
head of sales for fixed income, currencies and commodities in
the Americas, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will still be a leveraged loan sales team, a high-
yield sales group and a distressed credit desk, all of which
make up the leveraged finance business. Some team members will
cover clients that buy both loans and bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their new role Meltzer and Shaffer will oversee sales
for investment-grade credits, leveraged finance, structured
products, the credit products group and municipal bonds. They
will both report to Cornacchia. Mix will report to Gmelich and
Simon Morris, who heads credit trading in Europe and Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2011 Departures &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes at Goldman Sachs come after Courtney Mather,
head of U.S. loan trading, Blake W. Mather, who ran bank loan
sales, and Buckley T. Ratchford, head of global bank loan
trading and distressed investing, left the firm last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The credit sales team will also see additional departures
as Cynthia A. &#8220;Cindy&#8221; Brower and Wendy E. Sacks have also
announced they are leaving. They both sold loans and distressed
debt for the lender. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs held $19.75 billion of loans and bridge debt
as of Dec. 31, up from $18.04 billion a year earlier, according
to an annual filing. The company said those credits were held
&#8220;in connection with our origination, investing and market-
making activities&#8221; and didn&#8217;t break out how much was held for
each purpose. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gulf Coast gasoline strengthened
after Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) shut units for work at its Beaumont
refinery in Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company shut down a crude unit and coker, Rachael
Moore, a spokeswoman for the refinery, said in an e-mail. The
Beaumont refinery can process 345,000 barrels of crude a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast (MOSGC87P) narrowed 0.5 cent to 11.25 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 10:30
a.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery
rose 0.18 cent to $3.2797 a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inventories of the fuel in the region fell 1.66 million
barrels to 72.1 million last week, according to the Energy
Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motiva Enterprises LLC reported a process upset related to
fluid catalytic cracker No. 3 at the Port Arthur, Texas,
refinery, according to a filing yesterday with state regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Houston-based Motiva is a joint venture of Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA) and Saudi Arabian Oil Co. Kayla Macke, a Motiva &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imports to the East Coast rose 262,000 barrels to 758,000
barrels a day, the government said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premium for conventional gasoline to be blended with
ethanol, or CBOB, in New York Harbor (MOSNCB87) narrowed 2.25 cents to 5.5
cents a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank, will pay $20 million to resolve a U.S. regulator&#8217;s
claims that the firm mishandled customer funds from Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) from 2006 to 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, serving as Lehman&#8217;s main clearing bank, counted
client money as belonging to the firm itself while extending
loans that let Lehman bet on markets, the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission said today in a statement. When Lehman filed
for bankruptcy in September 2008, JPMorgan refused to release
the money for two weeks until CFTC officials insisted, the
watchdog said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collapses of Wall Street firms including MF Global Holdings
Ltd. (MFGLQ) have spawned customer claims that their money was frozen or
lost after companies improperly used their holdings. Lehman at
times had more than $1 billion of clients&#8217; funds deposited with
JPMorgan, which improperly counted segregated customer funds in
extending credit over a 22-month period, according to the CFTC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The laws applying to customer segregated accounts impose
critical restrictions on how financial institutions can treat
customer funds, and prohibit these institutions from standing in
the way of immediate withdrawal,&#8221; CFTC Enforcement Director
David Meister said in the agency&#8217;s statement. &#8220;These laws must
be strictly observed at all times, whether the markets are calm
or in crisis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan settled claims that it violated commodities laws
without admitting or denying wrongdoing, according to the CFTC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Calculation Errors &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The errors were unintentional, and JPMorgan didn&#8217;t use
customer funds to meet any of Lehman&#8217;s obligations, the bank
said in a statement today. The entire balance of one Lehman
accounts was mistakenly factored into JPMorgan&#8217;s daily
calculation of the broker-dealer&#8217;s assets in determining how
much credit to extend, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The size of this customer account was small relative to
the overall relationship between JPMorgan and Lehman, as was any
additional credit extended by JPMorgan to Lehman as a result of
the account&#8217;s inclusion in the calculation of credit,&#8221; JPMorgan
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman, which filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history
with $613 billion in debt, said last month it was exiting court
protection and will make a first payment to creditors April 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MF Global &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. lawmakers questioned a JPMorgan executive last month
about the bank&#8217;s handling of MF Global customer funds during a
hearing on that New York broker&#8217;s Oct. 31 bankruptcy, which left
a $1.6 billion shortfall in client money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diane Genova, a deputy general counsel for JPMorgan, told a
House Financial Services subcommittee that the bank contacted
Jon S. Corzine, MF Global&#8217;s former chairman and chief executive
officer, to seek written confirmation that $175 million
transferred to cover an overdraft in a London subsidiary&#8217;s
account represented only the firm&#8217;s funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global General Counsel Laurie Ferber told JPMorgan the
transfer &#8220;represented a withdrawal of MF Global&#8217;s own funds
held in a customer segregated account, and that we therefore did
not need to be concerned,&#8221; Genova said. After rejecting the
bank&#8217;s initial request as too broad, Ferber told JPMorgan
representatives she would arrange to get a revised version of a
confirmation letter signed, Genova told lawmakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global never returned a signed letter, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan hasn&#8217;t been accused of any wrongdoing in the MF
Global investigation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twenty-two years ago, International
Business Machines Corp. (IBM) used its clout to protest racial
discrimination. The company joined other corporate sponsors in
pulling television advertising from the PGA Championship which
was being played at a whites-only Alabama golf club. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shoal Creek club caved. Augusta National Golf Club
followed, also inviting its first black member to join in 1990. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now IBM faces pressure closer to home over Augusta
National&#8217;s policy against admitting female members, including
its new Chief Executive Officer Virginia &#8220;Ginni&#8221; Rometty. IBM
is one of three corporate sponsors of the Masters Tournament,
scheduled to begin tomorrow at the club. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s CEO traditionally dons the club&#8217;s signature
green member blazer at the tournament, as do the CEOs of co-
sponsors Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and ATT Inc. (T) IBM will have to decide
whether to keep spending the money if its CEO lacks equal status
with other sponsors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The corporate dollars and the corporate decisions to be
associated with something that&#8217;s known as discriminatory&#8221; opens
sponsors to scrutiny, said Mike Paul, president of MGP 
Associates, a New York-based reputation management firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Augusta National&#8217;s Chairman Billy Payne, who&#8217;s in charge of
the club and tournament, faced the media today for his annual
Masters-eve address and reiterated the club&#8217;s policy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the liquidator of Bernard Madoff&#8217;s firm tries to come back from defeats in U.S. district
court, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) opposed his appeal of a judge&#8217;s
ruling that threw out $19 billion of his claims for damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The district court correctly held that the trustee has no
authority to bring common law damages claims against JPMorgan,&#8221;
the bank said in a filing today in federal appeals court in New
York. UBS AG (UBSN) and HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) separately opposed the
trustee&#8217;s appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff trustee Irving Picard appealed rulings in four cases
against banks that barred him from demanding a total of about
$30 billion on behalf of the con man&#8217;s investors. UniCredit SpA (UCG)
also filed arguments today on why the appeal should be rejected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in July dismissed almost $9
billion in damages that Picard sought from HSBC and feeder
funds, saying the trustee exceeded his powers. Picard sued for
$19 billion from the con man&#8217;s banker, JPMorgan, which U.S.
District Judge Colleen McMahon dismissed, agreeing with Rakoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard alleged in his lawsuits that the banks ignored &#8220;red
flags&#8221; warning of Madoff&#8217;s fraud, hurting Madoff&#8217;s customers.
Rakoff said Picard&#8217;s powers as a bankruptcy trustee are limited.
While he can try to recover some money for the Ponzi scheme
operator&#8217;s estate, he can&#8217;t sue banks on behalf of Madoff
customers, and he can&#8217;t accuse them of fraud because he is
trustee for a fraudulent enterprise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Too Activist&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;How far will the courts allow someone to be aggressive in
their use of the law?&#8221; said Michael Clark, a former federal
prosecutor with Duane Morris LLP in Houston who specializes in
financial fraud and has handled appeals. &#8220;When lower court
judges and trustees are too activist, there&#8217;s a tendency for
higher courts to look and say, &#8216;You have spread your wings too
far.&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard, a New York bankruptcy lawyer, filed multibillion-
dollar lawsuits against the biggest banks, charging $273 million
for his firm&#8217;s work since Madoff&#8217;s 2008 arrest. Now, he&#8217;s having
to defend his aggressive approach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard&#8217;s lawsuit against JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank,
&#8220;is a massive overreach on the part of a trustee who, in a
search for deep pockets, has recklessly accused people at
JPMorgan of participating in Madoff&#8217;s crimes without factual
support and without regard for the consequences of his public
accusations,&#8221; the bank said in today&#8217;s filing. &#8220;And his basic
thesis -- namely that JPMorgan employees deliberately joined in
a doomed-to-fail Ponzi scheme simply to perverse routing banking
income -- is preposterous.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Fees &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan earned $590,000 in fees from Madoff&#8217;s brokerage
for banking services from 2002 to 2008, and $3.5 million in
interest, the bank said. JPMorgan&#8217;s revenue in 2008 was about
$67 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suing banks, &#8220;the trustee purported to bring tort claims
against deep-pocket third parties on behalf of BLMIS customers
based on a variety of inconsistent and often-changing
theories,&#8221; UBS, Switzerland&#8217;s largest bank, said in its filing.
&#8220;The court rightly rejected the trustee&#8217;s effort to assert such
overreaching claims.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McMahon handled Zurich-based UBS&#8217;s case as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard&#8217;s legal strategy is &#8220;contrary to well-established
precedent,&#8221; London-based HSBC said in today&#8217;s filing, referring
to a trustee&#8217;s powers in other frauds. HSBC, Europe&#8217;s largest
bank, has faulted Picard for insisting it had obligations to all
Madoff investors and should have probed the fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Enormous Claims&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC, which provided custodial services to feeder funds
that invested with Madoff, said Picard is &#8220;asserting enormous
claims against parties who provided no services and owed no duty
to BLMIS or to the creditors or customers the trustee seeks to
benefit.&#8221; Picard &#8220;seems determined to make this the largest
and most expensive&#8221; brokerage liquidation in history, HSBC
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HSBC and JPMorgan rulings came after the Anna Nicole Smith case, when the U.S. Supreme Court in June limited
bankruptcy judges&#8217; ability to rule on common-law claims. That
stopped the former Playboy model&#8217;s heirs from collecting
millions of dollars from Texas billionaire J. Howard Marshall&#8217;s
estate, and put district judges in control of more bankruptcy
issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Madoff trustee&#8217;s appeals may not bring a reversal, said
Peter Henning, a former Securities and Exchange Commission
lawyer who teaches at Wayne State University in Detroit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Solid Ground&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Rakoff and McMahon were on fairly solid legal ground, so
the appeals judges are less likely to reverse them,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Picard on March 21 filed a notice of appeal in
his biggest case, a $59 billion racketeering suit against
UniCredit, Sonja Kohn and other parties, bringing the total
amount he is fighting for to $90 billion. The current appeal
involves a smaller amount sought from Italy&#8217;s UniCredit in the
HSBC case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If he loses the appeals, Madoff clients will have a smaller
pot from which to recover losses, and investors who bought
discounted claims on the con man&#8217;s estate may lose the bets they
made. The trustee&#8217;s more than 1,000 suits demanded about $100
billion initially. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanda Remus, a Picard spokeswoman, has previously said
Picard remains confident of his right to make the claims against
the banks. She didn&#8217;t respond to an e-mail seeking comment on
today&#8217;s filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lost Principal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard&#8217;s demands for money from JPMorgan equaled his
estimate of principal lost by all Madoff investors by the time
the Ponzi scheme collapsed, according to his lawsuit. The bank
could have stopped the fraud by passing on its suspicions to
regulators, he alleged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, based in New York, said it didn&#8217;t know about the
fraud or participate in it, and can&#8217;t be blamed for a scheme
orchestrated by Madoff alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 73, is serving a 150-year sentence in a federal
prison in North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main case is Securities Investor Protection Corp. v.
Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, 08-ap-1789, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The district court cases are Picard v. JPMorgan, 11-5044,
Picard v. UBS, 11-5051, Picard v. UniCredit, 11-5175, Picard v.
HSBC, 11-5207, all in the U.S. Court of Appeals, Second Circuit
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) mostly hedges
silver for clients, and large speculative bets aren&#8217;t &#8220;part of
our business model,&#8221; Blythe Masters, the bank&#8217;s head of global
commodities, told CNBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market participants &#8220;don&#8217;t see all our activity,&#8221; and
bloggers have &#8220;a misunderstanding of the nature of our
business,&#8221; Masters said today in an interview on CNBC. There is
&#8220;an underlying client position&#8221; involved in hedge or forward
trades, she said on CNBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A multiyear investigation into the possibility of unlawful
acts in the silver market is continuing after regulators
analyzed more than 100,000 documents, the U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission said in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silver futures for May delivery rose 2.2 percent to close
at $31.73 an ounce today. The price has dropped 36 percent from
a 31-year high of $49.845 on April 25, 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, based in New York, and HSBC Holdings Plc were
sued in October 2010 by investors, including Peter Laskaris, who
alleged that starting in March 2008, the banks manipulated
silver in futures and options, partly by placing so-called spoof
trading orders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks reduced their collusive trading and their
holdings in futures market after a government investigation
began in 2008, according to the complaint by Laskaris. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Suits Pending &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September, investors said in a consolidated class-action
complaint that they had signed a tolling agreement with HSBC and
weren&#8217;t naming the bank as a defendant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tolling agreements are often used to stop statutes of
limitation from running while the parties discuss settlement or
dismissal of a claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Laskaris case is one of about 45 similar suits pending
in federal court in Manhattan, where they have been transferred
for pretrial proceedings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to
comment today on the pending cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, along with Barclays Plc, joined Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley as the most active in global
commodity derivatives trading, a Greenwich Associates survey of
corporate treasury officials shows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the drugmaker that&#8217;s
fired 26,000 workers in three years, is cutting its employee
severance package after May 14, according to an internal memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s biggest pharmaceutical company has been focused
on trimming costs since it acquired Wyeth in January 2009. This
year, Pfizer is wrestling with sales losses after its biggest
product, the cholesterol drug Lipitor with $9.6 billion in 2011
sales, began facing generic competition for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Ian Read, who took over in December
2010, has pledged to cut $1 billion from operations in 2012. The
memo says basic severance pay will be lowered to eight weeks
from 12 for U.S. workers, and that health benefits will last
eight weeks rather than a year. Employees get additional weeks
of pay and health insurance the longer they&#8217;ve been with the
company. The memo was supplied to Bloomberg by a Pfizer
employee, and confirmed by Joan Campion, a spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our benefits continue to be competitive when compared
against those offered by our industry peers and other leading
global companies,&#8221; the memo said. &#8220;We will continue to analyze
all of our benefit programs to support our long-term
competitiveness and the sustainability of benefits in today&#8217;s
challenging business environment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, based in New York, trimmed 20 percent of the
combined workforce after acquiring Wyeth, Chief Financial
Officer Frank D&#8217;Amelio said in an interview in January. In 2011,
Pfizer cut $642 million, or 5 percent, from expenses, the
company has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other parts of the drugmaker&#8217;s employee severance package,
including a 60-day notice and a $5,000 retraining program, will
remain in place, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares fell less than 1 percent to $22.34 at the
close of New York trading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frank Quattrone, the banker who
managed almost 200 technology initial public offerings in the
1990s, said companies should look beyond Morgan Stanley (MS) and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) for banks to lead their debuts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of those two firms has been the primary manager on
every high-profile technology IPO in the past year, including
LinkedIn Corp., Groupon Inc., Zynga Inc. and Yelp Inc., with
Morgan Stanley picked to lead Facebook&#8217;s upcoming offering.
Getting other banks to lead would enable more companies to go
public, Quattrone said yesterday at a conference in Menlo Park,
California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a perception in the marketplace that Morgan
Stanley and Goldman Sachs are the only real worthwhile, safe
bookrunners,&#8221; said Quattrone, who now runs investment advisory
firm Qatalyst Group in San Francisco. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t feel forced
to impose this underwriting duopoly on yourselves.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pen Pendleton, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley, and Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, didn&#8217;t immediately
return calls for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quattrone, 56, knows about working at the biggest banks.
Since joining the investment banking industry in the 1970s, he&#8217;s
led the technology groups at Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and
Credit Suisse Group. He worked on the public offerings of Cisco
Systems Inc., Netscape Communications Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Morgan Stanley, where Quattrone stayed until 1996, his
group managed about 10 percent of technology IPOs, Goldman Sachs
led 5 percent to 10 percent, and the rest were handled by
smaller firms, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Boutique-Dominated&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For the most part, it was a boutique-dominated
practice,&#8221; Quattrone said. Today, it&#8217;s unheard of for a
boutique bank to lead a big deal, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Quattrone said this is the best climate for IPOs
since 2000, and may even improve after President Barack Obama
signs a law that eases the regulatory burden on companies
preparing to go public. For his own business, he&#8217;s sticking
mostly with the mergers and acquisitions market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quattrone founded Qatalyst in 2008 after a five-year hiatus
from the industry, during which he successfully defended himself
against allegations he hindered an investigation of Credit
Suisse&#8217;s IPO practices. He said Qatalyst has worked on 36
transactions valued at $65 billion. They include Autonomy
Corp.&#8217;s $10.3 billion sale to Hewlett-Packard Co., and Google
Inc.&#8217;s $12.5 billion purchase of Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jes Staley, chief executive officer
of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s investment bank, beat his Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) counterpart in compensation after boosting
earnings during last year&#8217;s market slump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staley&#8217;s $16 million award for 2011 almost held steady from
the $17 million he made the previous year as profit at the
firm&#8217;s investment bank climbed 2.3 percent to $6.8 billion. Bank
of America co-chief operating officer Thomas K. Montag&#8217;s pay
dropped 25 percent to $12 million after profit at the lender&#8217;s
investment bank plunged by more than half to $2.97 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 55-year-old executives, who received almost the same
amount for 2010, saw their pay diverge as the firms navigated
turmoil created by the European debt crisis. While clients
gravitated toward JPMorgan because it was considered a &#8220;safe
harbor,&#8221; Bank of America executives traveled the world to
reassure customers after the firm&#8217;s credit grades were cut in
September, the leaders have said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Jes probably deserved to make more money, though paying
him more would send the wrong signal politically,&#8221; said Gustavo Dolfino, a former UBS AG banker and now president of Whiterock
Group LLC, a New York-based executive search firm. &#8220;It was a
different ballgame at Bank of America. Montag is a decent guy,
but he is under pressure.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those watching the Masters
Tournament are the reason why International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) isn&#8217;t speaking out about its new chief executive officer
possibly breaking the gender barrier at the Augusta National
Golf Club. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tournament draws an audience that includes &#8220;every CEO
in America,&#8221; said Scott O&#8217;Neil, president of Madison Square
Garden (MSG) Sports, who added IBM won&#8217;t jeopardize its much-desired
sponsorship in a battle over membership for Virginia &#8220;Ginni&#8221; Rometty, the company&#8217;s chief since January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, Exxon Mobil Corp. and ATT (T) Inc. are sponsors for the
Masters, which began today at Georgia&#8217;s Augusta National, where
no woman has been offered membership since its founding eight
decades ago. Historically, the club has offered a membership to
the CEO of IBM, allowing him to don the club&#8217;s green member
blazer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The status, visibility and reach of sponsoring the highest-
rated golf major is too valuable for IBM to criticize the all-
male membership -- or anything else -- at Augusta National,
which limits television commercials to four minutes an hour,
about half of most tournaments, and allocating all of that time
to sponsors, according to sports and marketing executives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama signed into
law a bill strengthening the ban on insider trading by members
of Congress and other government officials who might profit on
private knowledge they gain from work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president had called for passage of the bill, S. 2038,
in his State of the Union message in January. It is called the
Stock Act, for Stock Trading on Congressional Knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law prohibits lawmakers, their staffs and some
executive branch employees from trading stocks, commodities or
futures based on private information they learn on the job. It
would prevent lawmakers from participating in initial public
offerings that aren&#8217;t available to the general public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under terms of the new law, more than 28,000 senior
government officials who already must file public disclosures,
including the president, the vice president, cabinet members,
lawmakers and their staffs, must publicly report all trades
valued at $1,000 or more within 30 days after they are informed
of the transaction, and in no case any later than 45 days after
the transaction occurred. The rule wouldn&#8217;t apply to widely held
investment funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House passed the measure Feb. 9 by a 417-2 vote, and
the Senate followed March 22 by a vote of 96-3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bills to tighten insider-trading rules on members of
Congress had languished until late last year, when CBS&#8217;s &#8220;60
Minutes&#8221; program reported that lawmakers could legally trade
stock based on non-public information, giving the legislation
new urgency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law also blocks bonuses for Fannie Mae (FNMA), Freddie Mac (FMCC)
executives while the companies remain under government
conservatorship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Pays $20 Million to End CFTC Segregated-Fund Claim &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest U.S. bank, will pay $20
million to resolve a U.S. regulator&#8217;s claims that the firm
mishandled customer funds from Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)
from 2006 to 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, serving as Lehman&#8217;s main clearing bank, counted
client money as belonging to the firm itself while extending
loans that let Lehman bet on markets, the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission said yesterday in a statement. When Lehman
filed for bankruptcy in September 2008, JPMorgan refused to
release the money for two weeks until CFTC officials insisted,
the watchdog said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collapses of Wall Street firms including MF Global Holdings
Ltd. (MF) have spawned customer claims that their money was frozen or
lost after companies improperly used their holdings. Lehman at
times had more than $1 billion of clients&#8217; funds deposited with
JPMorgan, which improperly counted segregated customer funds in
extending credit over a 22-month period, according to the CFTC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan settled claims that it violated commodities laws
without admitting or denying wrongdoing, according to the CFTC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The errors were unintentional, and JPMorgan didn&#8217;t use
customer funds to meet any of Lehman&#8217;s obligations, the bank
said in a statement yesterday. The entire balance of one Lehman
accounts was mistakenly factored into JPMorgan&#8217;s daily
calculation of the broker-dealer&#8217;s assets in determining how
much credit to extend, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;SEC Warns Exchanges to Protect Markets From Glitches Gone Awry &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than five months before a software error ruined Bats
Global Markets Inc. (BATS)&#8217;s initial public offering, U.S. regulators
put exchanges on notice that they need to do more to protect
investors from technology gone awry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The missive came in the form of a prologue to a Securities
and Exchange Commission case against Direct Edge Holdings LLC in
October over claims the exchange operator had weak internal
controls that caused its trading system to fail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency, working to avoid another event like the May 6,
2010, rout that erased $862 billion from equities in 20 minutes,
decided to use the Direct Edge case to create a blueprint for
actions against other exchanges, according to a person with
direct knowledge of the decision. While the SEC didn&#8217;t fault
exchanges in the 2010 crash, the event magnified pressure on the
commission to show it can ensure the fragmented marketplace of
high-speed, computer-driven trading is safe for investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2010 &#8220;flash crash,&#8221; as it has come to be known,
spawned about 20 separate SEC investigations encompassing a
dozen areas of possible securities law violations, according to
the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the
probes aren&#8217;t public. While some of the investigations involve
possible illegal trading practices, those that focus on
exchanges revolve around whether the venues have the right
compliance structures to address trading disruptions that could
spiral out of control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel Hawke, chief of the SEC enforcement&#8217;s market abuse
unit, said &#8220;exchange conduct and compliance is an area of
renewed enforcement interest.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct Edge spokesman Jim Gorman, Bats spokesman Randy
Williams, Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ) spokesman Robert Madden and NYSE
Euronext (NYX) spokesman Richard Adamonis declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;WTO Backs Ruling That U.S. Clove-Cigarette Ban Discriminates &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A U.S. ban on clove cigarettes that&#8217;s designed to prevent
teenagers from starting to smoke is discriminatory, World Trade
Organization judges said as they upheld an earlier ruling
backing a complaint by Indonesia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WTO appellate judges agreed with a Sept. 2 decision that
the U.S. tobacco legislation, signed by President Barack Obama
in June 2009, unfairly prohibits cloves and not the mint used to
make menthol cigarettes. Indonesia, the world&#8217;s largest producer
of clove cigarettes, or kreteks, made by companies such as PT
Gudang Garam (GGRM), accounted for almost all of the $15 million of
clove-cigarette sales in the U.S. before the ban. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Menthol-flavored cigarettes produced by U.S. manufacturers
such as Altria Group Inc. (MO)&#8217;s Philip Morris USA and Lorillard Inc. (LO)
were excluded as part of a 2008 compromise by lawmakers that led
Altria to endorse the legislation. Menthol cigarettes, the most
popular flavor, constituted 27 percent of the U.S. market in
2008, the latest Federal Trade Commission data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. law &#8220;accords imported clove cigarettes less
favorable treatment than that accorded to domestic menthol
cigarettes,&#8221; the appellate judges said in their 103-page report
on the Geneva-based WTO&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The United States is very disappointed with the outcome
of this dispute,&#8221; Nkenge Harmon, a spokeswoman for the U.S.
Trade Representative&#8217;s office, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies show that 17-year-olds are almost three times more
likely to use flavored cigarettes than people over 25, according
to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Lori Wallach, director
of the consumer-advocacy organization Public Citizen&#8217;s Global
Trade Watch, urged the Obama administration and Congress not to
&#8220;bow&#8221; to yesterday&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Honduras complained at the WTO about an
Australian law that prohibits the display of tobacco companies&#8217;
logos, labels and trademarks, saying the ban violates global
rules on intellectual property. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Dec. 1, cigarettes in Australia will have to be sold
in dark brown packets, with no symbols or images and the same
font for all brands. Philip Morris International Inc. (PM), Imperial
Tobacco Group Plc (IMP), British American Tobacco Plc (BATS) and Japan
Tobacco Inc. (2914) are challenging the law and will present their
arguments against it in Canberra beginning April 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s complaint at the Geneva-based trade arbiter
follows a similar move by Ukraine on March 15. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Petroplus Gets Exemption From Regulatory Reporting Requirements &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petroplus Holdings AG (PPHN) said the SIX Swiss Exchange approved
its application for an exemption from certain regulatory
reporting and publicity requirements from now until May 11,
being the last day of trading of its shares, according to a
statement issued by the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petroplus Holdings will continue to report information
&#8220;regarding management transactions and major changes in
ownership structure,&#8221; as well as complying with &#8220;the directive
on ad hoc publicity,&#8221; it said the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Financial Stability Board Starts Peer Review on Risk Governance &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Stability Board started a review among
regulators of banks&#8217; oversight of potential risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The peer review will take stock of progress in addressing
the weaknesses in risk governance identified during the recent
financial crisis at both national authorities and firms,&#8221; the
FSB said on its website yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Basel Would Have Defeated 20% of EU&#8217;s Biggest Banks in 2011 &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty percent of Europe&#8217;s biggest banks would have failed
to meet global capital standards, known as Basel III, as of June
2011, the European Banking Authority said in an impact
assessment of the planned rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a fifth of the 48 largest banks in the study would
have had a core tier 1 capital ratio below 4.5 percent, the
absolute minimum allowed under Basel III guidelines, the EBA
said in a report published on its website yesterday. Half of
those would have needed to raise a combined 242 billion euros
($318 billion) to reach a 7 percent ratio, the minimum for
internationally active banks, according to the report, based on
June data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given these results, a significant effort by banks to
fulfill the risk-based capital requirements is expected,&#8221; the
EBA, the region&#8217;s top banking regulator, said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global regulators at the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision have clashed with banks over the severity of the
overhaul of capital and liquidity rules, known as Basel III,
which was designed to prevent a rerun of the crisis that
cascaded across financial markets after the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;SFO Refused Trial Delay as It Probes Tchenguiz Arrest Errors &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K.&#8217;s Serious Fraud Office was denied more time to
prepare for a trial over its handling of the 2011 arrests of
real estate investors Vincent and Robert Tchenguiz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the watchdog started an internal review of &#8220;errors&#8221;
it made, its lawyers said, the probe was complicated by the
departure of key staff involved in the criminal investigation,
including the man who led it, Mick Randall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge John Thomas ruled the trial should be held May 22 as
planned and criticized the SFO for not reporting potential
delays earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tchenguiz brothers claim their detentions in March 2011
were unlawful. They were among seven men arrested as part of an
SFO investigation into the collapse of Iceland&#8217;s Kaupthing Bank
Hf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SFO spokesman David Jones didn&#8217;t respond to phone calls
requesting comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brothers are seeking millions of pounds in damages,
attorneys for the SFO said. The court granted a request from the
brothers in February for a review of their arrests, which the
men claim were unlawful because the warrants were obtained with
incorrect information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Robert Tchenguiz v. Director of the Serious
Fraud Office  Anr, High Court of Justice, Queen&#8217;s Bench
Division, Administrative Court, CO/4468/2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bouygues Rights Complaints Against France Found Inadmissible &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bouygues SA (EN)&#8217;s complaints against France for violations of
its rights were declared &#8220;manifestly ill-founded&#8221; by the
European Court of Human Rights, which said the appeal is
therefore inadmissible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bouygues argued its rights to a fair trial and presumption
of innocence were breached by France&#8217;s competition regulator in
2005 during regulatory proceedings against its Bouygues Telecom
unit for colluding with other mobile-phone operators, according
to a statement today by the court on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appellate courts rejected the Paris-based company&#8217;s efforts
to overturn the decision in 2006 and 2007. A 2010 decision by
France&#8217;s highest appeals court upheld the anti-competitive
findings against Bouygues, the rights court said in summarizing
the dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Bouygues declined to immediately comment
on the ruling by the Strasbourg, France-based court. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fed&#8217;s Lacker Says Volcker Rule May Be &#8216;Impossible&#8217; to Implement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker
said a U.S. law restricting proprietary trading at banks and
scheduled for enactment in July may be &#8220;impossible&#8221; to
implement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called Volcker rule, named for its original
champion, former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker, is aimed at reducing
the odds that banks will make risky investments with their own
capital and put depositors&#8217; money at risk. Lacker said bank
trading books were &#8220;kind of tangential&#8221; to the financial
crisis of 2008-2009, when bank capital was eroded by losses on
risky mortgages, many of them bundled into complex securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Volcker rule is &#8220;fairly difficult if not impossible to
implement in a way that is at all reasonable,&#8221; Lacker said
yesterday in an interview with Bloomberg Television&#8217;s Trish
Regan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal is one of the most contentious provisions of
the 2010 Dodd-Frank act on financial oversight, and Lacker said
it would be &#8220;high on the list&#8221; of things he would change if he
could. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;SEC&#8217;s Paredes Sees Review Prior to New Access Rule, BNA Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissioner Troy Paredes
April 2 told a gathering of institutional investors that until
the commission has reviewed the experience of proxy access
through private ordering, he would be &#8220;hesitant&#8221; for the
agency to tackle another federal access regulation, BNA reported
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paredes made the remarks at the Council of Institutional
Investors&#8217; spring meeting in Washington, noting that he was
expressing his own opinions, which didn&#8217;t necessarily reflect
those of the SEC, the other commissioners, or commission staff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paredes remarks about proxy access were made in response to
a question from Jane Hamblen, chief legal counsel of the State
of Wisconsin Investment Board, about what kind of data
institutional investors can provide to the SEC to help another
federal access rule withstand court scrutiny. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of the process, costs and benefits, &#8220;data is
always extraordinarily important&#8221; Paredes told Hamblen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit struck down the SEC&#8217;s mandatory proxy access
rule. The regulation would have allowed qualifying shareholders,
for the first time, to have their director nominees included in
corporate proxy solicitation materials. The appellate court
found that the SEC failed to properly evaluate the economic
impact of the rule. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bank of Japan Nominee Kono Rejected as Lawmakers Seek Easing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda&#8217;s nominee to the Bank of
Japan (8301) board was rejected by the upper house of parliament in a
victory for lawmakers pressing for more monetary easing to spur
growth and end deflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNP Paribas SA (BNP) economist Ryutaro Kono was blocked by a vote
of 127 to 111 in the house, where the ruling Democratic Party of
Japan is a minority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese stocks pared losses on the decision, which leaves
the central bank with two vacant seats on a nine-person board
and gives lawmakers a platform for urging Governor Masaaki
Shirakawa to take bolder action. The central bank has pledged
&#8220;powerful easing&#8221; until a 1 percent inflation goal is in
sight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan has a history of wrangling over central bank
appointments, with the DPJ blocking appointments in 2008 and
2009 when the party was in opposition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CIFG Assurance North America Inc.
asked a judge to let it add shuttered loan originator GreenPoint
Mortgage Funding Inc. to a lawsuit against Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) over $275 million in mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insurer sued Goldman Sachs in New York State Supreme
Court in Manhattan in August, accusing the investment bank of
making misrepresentations in connection with the securitization
of a portfolio of 6,204 mortgage loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In court documents filed yesterday, CIFG asked Justice O.
Peter Sherwood to allow it to add GreenPoint as a defendant if a
motion by Goldman Sachs to dismiss the complaint isn&#8217;t granted,
saying that GreenPoint originated a &#8220;substantial&#8221; number of
the loans involved in the securitization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;GreenPoint was not included in the original complaint
because GreenPoint&#8217;s contractually provided time to respond to
CIFG&#8217;s demand that it repurchase defective loans had not yet
expired,&#8221; CIFG said in yesterday&#8217;s filing. &#8220;Post-complaint
correspondence with GreenPoint has now confirmed that GreenPoint
will not comply with CIFG&#8217;s repurchase demand.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs in October asked the court to throw out the
lawsuit, saying CIFG was informed of the risks associated with
the investments, failed to conduct its own due diligence and
hasn&#8217;t sought &#8220;clear contractual remedies&#8221; that would allow it
to seek the repurchase of specific loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Needless Burden&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a letter to Sherwood dated yesterday, lawyers for
Goldman Sachs called CIFG&#8217;s request an &#8220;inappropriate
maneuver&#8221; that would impose &#8220;needless burden&#8221; on the court
and the parties involved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Bernard Fried on Feb. 24 denied a motion by CIFG
and Syncora Guarantee Inc. to bring new claims against
GreenPoint in a lawsuit over the quality of $1.8 billion of
home-equity loans the two insurers guaranteed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fried in March 2010 threw out the original 2009 lawsuit,
which accused the loan originator of violating its mortgage-
underwriting guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) shut Novato, California-based
GreenPoint in August 2007, less than a year after acquiring its
parent company, Long Island&#8217;s North Fork Bancorp. Julie Rakes, a
spokeswoman for McLean, Virginia-based Capital One, said in an
e-mail that the company doesn&#8217;t comment on pending litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is CIFG Assurance North America Inc. v. Goldman,
Sachs  Co., 652286/2011, New York Supreme Court, New York
County (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aksa Enerji Uretim AS (AKSEN), a Turkish
utility, rose in Istanbul after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) agreed
to buy as much as 13.3 percent of the company for $240 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aksa added 0.8 percent to 3.92 liras by the close in
Istanbul, while the overall Istanbul Stock Exchange National 100
Index (XU100) fell a third day, retreating 1.8 percent to 60,939.55. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale revises down an earlier agreement in which Goldman
was to receive a 15.1 percent stake for $268 million, according
to a statement to the exchange today from Aksa&#8217;s owner, Kazanci
Holding AS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new agreement is positive for Aksa as it implies a
higher valuation for the company, Zeynep Karaman, an analyst at
Istanbul-based brokerage BGC Partners (BGCP), said in an e-mailed
report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implied valuation of $1.8 billion for the company is
more than 40 percent higher than the valuation based on
yesterday&#8217;s closing price, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is paying developers
to bring well-known apps to its Windows Phone, as the world&#8217;s
biggest software maker seeks to challenge competitors such as
Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPhone, the New York Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is paying app makers to develop a Windows Phone
version for brand-name apps, according to the paper. These
include Foursquare, a mobile social network, and Cheezburger
Network, a collection of humor and entertainment sites, the
newspaper said. Microsoft has more than 70,000 apps, while Apple
has more than 600,000 and Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Android system has close
to 400,000, the newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) agreed to
buy as much as 13.3 percent of Aksa Enerji Uretim AS (AKSEN), one of
Turkey&#8217;s two biggest power producers, for $240 million, revising
down an earlier agreement to acquire a 15.1 percent stake for
$268 million, Aksa owner Kazanci Holding AS said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement between Kazanci Holding and Goldman Sachs
also envisages the provision of a $400 million syndicated loan
for Kazanci, to be arranged by Goldman, Turkiye Is Bankasi (ISATR) AS
and Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN), to repay a bridge loan of $192
million from Goldman, Kazanci said in a statement to the
Istanbul Stock Exchange today. Kazanci got the bridge loan for
Aksa last year, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman will initially own 5.82 percent of Aksa Enerji by
paying $105 million and the U.S. lender committed to buy another
7.48 percent for $135 million, Kazanci said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The syndicated loan, for which Kazanci&#8217;s 65.5 percent and
Goldman&#8217;s 13.3 percent stakes are used as collateral, will have
a maturity of six years including a three-year grace period, the
statement said. Goldman could sell its Aksa Enerji holding at
any time during the maturity period of the loan, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aksa Enerji rose 1.3 percent to 3.94 liras at 10:30 a.m. in
Istanbul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Danielle Kucera" date="Apr 09, 2012  9:11 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-09/aol-to-sell-patents-to-microsoft-for-1-056-billion-in-cash.html"><headline>AOL Jumps After $1.06 Billion Patent Accord With Microsoft</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;AOL Inc. (AOL), under shareholder pressure
to make changes as revenue shrinks, agreed to sell and license
patents to Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) in a transaction valued at $1.06
billion, triggering its biggest stock gain in two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AOL rose 43 percent to $26.40 at the close in New York, the
biggest one-day increase since Nov. 25, 2009. The shares had
lost 8.2 percent of their value in the past year before today.
Microsoft, meanwhile, fell 1.3 percent to $31.10 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arrangement, which will give more than 800 patents and
related applications to Microsoft, lets New York-based AOL
generate additional funds amid slow advertising growth and a
decline in dial-up Internet subscribers. AOL, whose revenue has
dropped 29 percent since it was spun off from Time Warner Inc. (TWX)
in late 2009, has faced pressure from shareholder Starboard
Value LP to consider moves such as a patent deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Few people were anticipating that they were going to
generate $1 billion-plus of cash,&#8221; said Tom Forte, an analyst
at Telsey Advisory Group in New York. &#8220;The company has done an
incredible job of creating value from their patent portfolio.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s biggest software maker, is adding
the patents as it tussles with Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc.
in the courts to protect intellectual property rights related to
the Windows Phone operating system and Xbox video-gaming
consoles. Technology giants such as Apple Inc. and Google Inc.
also are building patent war chests in an effort to fend off
litigation and defend their products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More Artillery &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re building up their ammunition,&#8221; said Ed Maguire,
an analyst at Credit Agricole Securities in New York. Microsoft
may need the patents to go after the manufacturers of Android
handsets, which license the operating system from Google, he
said. &#8220;It&#8217;s certainly worth Microsoft&#8217;s time and resources to
go out and acquire something that lets you extract money from
the Googles and the handset makers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other companies that expressed interest in acquiring AOL&#8217;s
patents included Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), EBay Inc., Facebook Inc. and
Google, according to a person familiar with the sale process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives of those companies declined to comment on
involvement in the auction. Reuters reported on their interest
in acquiring AOL&#8217;s patents earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Litigious Industry &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft gains nonexclusive license to AOL&#8217;s retained
patent portfolio, the companies said today in a statement. AOL
will hold more than 300 patents and applications after the
transaction. Microsoft, which had $52.7 billion in cash and
equivalents last year, is trying to keep the patents away from
competitors, said James Conley, a professor at Northwestern
University who studies patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fact that AOL was able to get the money it did as
fast as it did for its patents, and from Microsoft, is an
indication of how litigious the space has become,&#8221; Anthony DiClemente, an analyst at Barclays Capital Inc. in New York,
said in a report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Kutz, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft, said the company isn&#8217;t ready to comment on what the
patents cover or what the company will use them for. Microsoft
historically has used patents more for licensing than lawsuits,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Clear Focus&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim Armstrong, AOL&#8217;s chief executive officer, said he
expects the license arrangement with Microsoft to generate $100
million over the life of the patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This strengthens our ability to give more resources back
to shareholders,&#8221; Armstrong said in an interview. It &#8220;allows
us now to have a clear focus on operating our core strategy of
turning brands into businesses.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AOL reached the agreement late on April 5 after an open
auction, with many companies submitting bids, Armstrong said. He
declined to identify the other bidders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AOL said it plans to return a &#8220;significant portion&#8221; of
the sale proceeds to shareholders. Had the patents changed hands
last year, AOL said it would have had about $15 per share of
cash on hand as of Dec. 31, 2011. The company ended last year
with $407.5 million in cash and equivalents, down 49 percent
from 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starboard, which started pushing for change last year, had
said AOL&#8217;s patent portfolio could yield more than $1 billion.
Patent-advisory firm M-Cam Inc. estimated that AOL&#8217;s patent
portfolio would only be valued at about $290 million in a sale.
Jeffrey C. Smith, Starboard&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, declined to
comment on the Microsoft transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Huffington Post, Patch &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholders have called for AOL to turn around investments
in the Huffington Post, acquired as part of a $315 million
transaction last year, and Patch, whose local news sites are
designed for communities with populations of 15,000 to 75,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patch may have lost as much as $150 million in 2011, based
on fixed expenses of $160 million and an &#8220;immaterial&#8221; revenue
contribution as low as $10 million, Starboard said in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They will probably not be using the cash to make a major
acquisition or invest in Patch in a bigger way, for instance,&#8221;
said Clayton Moran, an analyst at Benchmark Co. in Delray Beach,
Florida. &#8220;Not only is the search business hindering revenue
growth, but their display business is losing share as Google and
Facebook bring in cheaper inventory.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AOL has struggled to revive revenue growth after separating
from Time Warner, as the company competes for advertising
dollars with Google and Facebook. AOL&#8217;s sales declined in each
quarter last year, and revenue this year is estimated to drop
3.7 percent to $2.1 billion, according to analysts&#8217; projections
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yahoo Deal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armstrong had been in talks with private-equity firms as
recently as September, when the CEO approached potential
financial partners about combining AOL with Yahoo! Inc., two
people said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starboard had a 5.2 percent stake in AOL as of February.
The fund said in a Feb. 24 statement that it was &#8220;increasingly
uncomfortable&#8221; with the direction AOL and the board leadership
are taking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evercore Partners Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. acted
as AOL&#8217;s financial advisers, and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen  Katz
and Finnegan, Henderson, Farabow, Garrett  Dunner LLP gave
legal counsel. Covington  Burling LLP advised Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the terms of the deal, Microsoft will have to pay AOL
a fee of $211.2 million if it chooses to end the transaction.
The deal is expected to be completed by the end of 2012, upon
receiving regulatory approvals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has accused Motorola Mobility, the mobile-phone
maker being acquired by Google, of infringing seven patents and
is seeking to block U.S. imports of devices that violate its
intellectual property rights. A U.S. trade agency is reviewing a
judge&#8217;s finding that only one of those patents was infringed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Motorola Mobility has demanded $4 billion a
year in patent royalties for use of technology critical to
functioning of the Xbox, Microsoft said in a March 30 filing. &lt;/p&gt;

Harrington, Bradley Keoun and Christine Harper" date="Apr 09, 2012  5:08 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-09/jpmorgan-trader-iksil-fuels-prop-trading-debate-with-bets.html"><headline>JPMorgan Trader Iksil Fuels Prop-Trading Debate With Bets</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) trader Bruno Iksil&#8217;s outsized bets in credit derivatives are drawing
attention to a little-known division that invests the company&#8217;s
reserves and fueling a debate over whether banks are taking
excessive risks with federally insured and subsidized money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iksil&#8217;s influence in the market has spurred some
counterparts to dub him Voldemort, after the Harry Potter
villain. He works in London in the bank&#8217;s chief investment
office, which has assembled traders from across Wall Street to
its staff of 400 who help oversee $350 billion in investments.
While the firm describes the unit&#8217;s main task as hedging risks
and investing excess cash, four hedge-fund managers and dealers
say the trades are big enough to move indexes and resemble
proprietary bets, or wagers made with the bank&#8217;s own money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trades, first reported by Bloomberg News April 5,
stirred debate among U.S. policy makers over the Easter-holiday
weekend as they wrangle over this year&#8217;s implementation of the
so-called Volcker rule, the portion of the Dodd-Frank Act that
sets limits on risk-taking by banks with government backing. The
law passed after the collapse of the subprime mortgage market
triggered the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. (INDU) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if the pro-Volcker folks used
this as a test case,&#8221; said Douglas Landy, a partner at law firm
Allen  Overy LLP who is representing Canadian banks in opposing
a current draft of the rule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Merkley, Miller &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Jeff Merkley criticized the transactions in a
statement that called for the rule&#8217;s prompt implementation,
while Representative Brad Miller said they show why related U.S.
laws should apply internationally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment on Iksil&#8217;s specific transactions, and Iksil
didn&#8217;t respond to phone messages and e-mails seeking comment.
Neither Iksil nor JPMorgan have been accused of wrongdoing, and
the full extent of his trading and the bank&#8217;s total risk of
loss, or total gain, on his investments isn&#8217;t known. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authorities will need more information from JPMorgan, the
biggest U.S. bank by assets, to discern the precise purpose of
Iksil&#8217;s transactions, said Clifford Rossi, an executive-in-
residence at the University of Maryland&#8217;s Robert H. Smith School
of Business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It clearly calls attention to the Volcker issue,&#8221; said
Rossi, who previously was a managing director at Citigroup Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Competitive Issues &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arthur Levitt, the former chairman of the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission, said banks may be required to reveal
more specifics about their derivatives holdings in order for
regulators to enforce the Volcker rule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s unfortunate,&#8221; Levitt said today in an interview
on Bloomberg Radio&#8217;s &#8220;Bloomberg Surveillance&#8221; with Ken Prewitt
and Tom Keene. &#8220;That raises all kinds of competitive issues.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levitt is a board member of Bloomberg LP, the parent of
Bloomberg News, and a senior adviser to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harvey Pitt, also a former SEC chairman, said he would ask
JPMorgan to explain the trades and then have the agency report
to the public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Any time any trader can be dominant in the marketplace,
that has to raise appropriate regulatory concerns,&#8221; Pitt said
today in a phone interview on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s
&#8220;InBusiness With Margaret Brennan&#8221; program. &#8220;That means the
markets can be influenced by a single actor, and that is not the
way our markets ought to operate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dimon&#8217;s Letter &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56, sent a
38-page letter to shareholders last week, saying he agrees with
the Volcker rule&#8217;s intent to eliminate &#8220;pure&#8221; proprietary
trading and ensure market-making won&#8217;t jeopardize banks. Still,
as with derivatives laws, the rule must be written so that it
doesn&#8217;t put U.S. banks at a global disadvantage, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We cannot and should not be in a position where the rule
affects U.S. banks outside the United States but not our foreign
competition,&#8221; he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iksil drew attention from market professionals in recent
months as trading accelerated in a group of credit-default-swap
indexes created before and during the 2008 financial crisis.
Until then, transactions had been dwindling as Wall Street banks
stopped creating structured debt that the indexes were used to
hedge against. Investors use credit-default swaps to shield
themselves from losses on corporate debt or to speculate on a
firm&#8217;s creditworthiness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;London Whale&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trader became such a big client of credit-derivatives
dealers that some started calling him Voldemort, the Harry
Potter book-series villain so powerful he simply was referred to
as &#8220;He Who Must Not Be Named,&#8221; said one fund manager, who
asked not to be identified because his firm does business with
JPMorgan. Iksil also has been dubbed the &#8220;London whale,&#8221;
another trader said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iksil joined JPMorgan in 2005, according to his career-
history record with the U.K. Financial Services Authority. He
worked at the French investment bank Natixis (KN) from 1999 to 2003,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Public records showing
Iksil&#8217;s date of birth couldn&#8217;t be located. One person who has
done business with Iksil said he&#8217;s in his late 30s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a group of hedge-fund traders last year bet that a
cluster of companies in one of the indexes wouldn&#8217;t default
before contracts expired in December, Iksil was taking the
opposite view, according to four market participants at hedge
funds and banks, who spoke on condition of anonymity because
they aren&#8217;t authorized to discuss the transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concentrated Risks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iksil&#8217;s bet won out, and the hedge funds faced losses of 25
percent, when American Airlines parent AMR Corp. filed for
bankruptcy less than a month before the insurance-like swaps
matured, the market participants said. The trades were made in
so-called tranches of the index, which take concentrated risks
on the member companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, Iksil has been betting on an index of 121
companies that all had investment-grade ratings when the
benchmark was created in September 2007, the market participants
said. Trading in that index surged 61 percent the past three
months, according to data from Depository Trust  Clearing Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The net amount of wagers on the index, which is tied to the
creditworthiness of companies such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and
now-junk-rated bond insurer MBIA Insurance Corp., soared to
almost $145 billion at the end of March from $90 billion three
months earlier, according to DTCC, which runs a central registry
for credit-default swaps and reports weekly aggregate volumes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iksil&#8217;s trades have been so large that they&#8217;re widening
gaps between the relative value of the indexes and the average
price of contracts tied to companies in those indexes, according
to the market participants. That has frustrated some hedge funds
that had bet the gaps would close, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First Quarter &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iksil has been selling default-protection on the index
using swaps that expire in December 2017, meaning he would cover
the counterparty&#8217;s losses if a company in the index fails, the
market participants said. The price of the index falls as more
insurance is sold against it. The index declined 38 basis points
in the first three months of 2012, the biggest quarterly drop
since 2009. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The positions, by the bank&#8217;s calculations, amount to tens
of billions of dollars and were built with the knowledge of
Iksil&#8217;s superiors, a person familiar with the firm&#8217;s view said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iksil may have built a position totaling as much as $100
billion in contracts in one index, according to the market
participants, who said they based their estimates on the trades
and price movements they witnessed as well as their
understanding of the size and structure of the markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Buying Protection &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade on the index, known as the Markit CDX North
America Investment Grade Series 9 (IBOXUG09), probably isn&#8217;t a one-way bet,
the people said. Iksil may be offsetting the trade by buying
protection on the same index with contracts that expire about
eight months from now, the people said. That strategy would pay
JPMorgan the difference between the long-dated contracts and the
short-dated ones, about 47 basis points as of April 6, and the
trade would gain when the gap narrows. The hedge would end in
December unless another trade is made to replace it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Someone in that position at JPMorgan would typically not
be doing pure speculation but would be involved in strategic
risk management for the firm,&#8221; Darrell Duffie, a professor at
Stanford University&#8217;s graduate school of business, said in a
telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan profited from a similar strategy as the credit
crisis erupted in 2008 by buying protection on short-dated
contracts linked to high-yield indexes while selling protection
on longer-dated contracts, a bet that a spike in corporate
defaults would happen sooner than markets were pricing in,
according to a February letter to regulators from Barry Zubrow,
the bank&#8217;s head of corporate and regulatory affairs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Losses Reduced &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This strategy resulted in the firm recognizing some gains
as near-term default risks increased,&#8221; Zubrow wrote. &#8220;The
gains recognized on these derivatives strategies offset in part
the losses that occurred on credit assets held by the firm.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zubrow said the trade, which was booked in the bank&#8217;s
market risk capital trading account, was a hedge that may have
been banned under the Volcker rule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chief investment office&#8217;s revenue swelled following the
financial crisis as federal regulators pushed banks to keep more
of their funds in liquid investments, and as deposits flooded in
because of JPMorgan&#8217;s reputation as one of the industry&#8217;s
strongest banks. Total securities holdings in the corporate
segment, which includes the chief investment office and
treasury, more than quadrupled to $340.2 billion in 2009 from
$76.5 billion in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bigger Pool &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra liquidity meant a bigger pool of money for the
chief investment office to manage -- and more revenue. The
bank&#8217;s annual report for 2009 showed $6.63 billion of revenue
for the corporate segment, up from $4.42 billion in 2007. It
cited &#8220;the chief investment office&#8217;s significant purchases of
mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by U.S. government
agencies, corporate debt securities, U.S. Treasury and
government agency securities and other asset-backed
securities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue in the corporate segment climbed again in 2010, to
$7.42 billion, reflecting a &#8220;repositioning of the portfolio in
response to changes in the interest-rate environment and to
rebalance exposure,&#8221; JPMorgan said in a regulatory filing. The
bank rewarded Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew with a $15
million pay package for 2010, saying in a shareholder letter
that she &#8220;was instrumental in setting the course and directing
the firm&#8217;s repositioning of the balance sheet.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Revenue Tumbled &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, revenue tumbled 44 percent to $4.14 billion in
the corporate segment, &#8220;driven by repositioning of the
investment securities portfolio and lower funding benefits from
financing the portfolio,&#8221; according to an annual filing. Drew,
55, got a 6.8 percent pay cut to $14 million, the bank said in a
regulatory filing last week. Her pay for the past two years was
higher than that of Chief Financial Officer Doug Braunstein.
Drew referred a request for comment to Evangelisti. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chief investment office is affiliated with the bank&#8217;s
treasury, helping to control market risks and investing excess
funds, according to the lender&#8217;s annual report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The chief investment office is responsible for managing
and hedging the firm&#8217;s foreign-exchange, interest-rate and other
structural risks,&#8221; Evangelisti said. It&#8217;s &#8220;focused on managing
the long-term structural assets and liabilities of the firm and
is not focused on short-term profits.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people hired by the group have come with risk-taking
pedigrees. Irene Tse, 42, a former portfolio manager at Stanley Druckenmiller&#8217;s now-closed hedge fund, Duquesne Capital
Management, joined last year as the group&#8217;s head in North
America, reporting to Drew. Achilles Macris, 51, a former co-
head of capital markets at German bank Dresdner Kleinwort
Wasserstein, runs the group in Europe and Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Experience, Connections &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A search through profiles on the LinkedIn professional-
networking website shows current and former executives in the
chief investment office citing their proprietary-trading
experience and connections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One executive who worked as a portfolio manager in
JPMorgan&#8217;s chief investment office said he ran what he called a
proprietary macro and relative-value trading book that produced
a 12 percent return on capital. An executive director wrote that
before he worked in fixed-income trading in the office, he was a
vice president in proprietary trading at JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A technology specialist who worked in the chief investment
office in New York in 2009 and 2010 wrote that he led New York
development and business analysis for a proprietary-trading
risk-management system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Volcker rule is supposed to take effect in July, though
regulators are still determining how it will make exceptions for
instances where firms are hedging to curtail risk in their
lending and trading businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Illuminate the Risk&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iksil&#8217;s &#8220;big bets illuminate the risk inherent in hedge
fund-style trading,&#8221; said Senator Merkley of Oregon, who added
the Volcker rule to Dodd-Frank along with Senator Carl Levin, a
fellow Democrat from Michigan. If the trades collapse, Merkley
said, &#8220;you want the resulting meltdown to happen outside of the
banks we depend on for loans to families and businesses.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Republican-controlled U.S. House of
Representatives returns from a spring recess, members are set to
vote on a bill that would limit Dodd-Frank clearing, trading and
collateral regulations from applying to trades between foreign-
based affiliates of U.S. banks and their overseas clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan trades are an example of why such exceptions
are misguided, said Representative Miller, a North Carolina
Democrat who sits on the Financial Services Committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Miller&#8217;s Vote &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even if these trades are done in London and even if they
are done by a foreign affiliate, there&#8217;s no doubt that JPMorgan
would be liable and that any solvency issue would be visited
upon the U.S. and the U.S. economy and the U.S. taxpayer,&#8221; said
Miller, who voted against the bill at a preliminary stage in the
committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even without regulatory scrutiny, reports that Iksil&#8217;s
trades were so large that they moved market prices are likely to
concern JPMorgan, Stanford University&#8217;s Duffie said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the trades were indeed part of a risk management
strategy, then the intent wouldn&#8217;t be to move markets,&#8221; Duffie
said. &#8220;The most obvious remedy is to reduce the extent to which
they put on such large trading positions in the future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Akbank TAS (AKBNK), the Turkish bank in

International to advise it on the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman will provide consultation to Akbank &#8220;in evaluating

&lt;p&gt; Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. energy producer, said first-quarter profit exceeded the
prior quarter because of rising oil prices, widening refining
margins and the sale of fuel-marketing assets in Spain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil and natural-gas production from company-operated wells
averaged the equivalent of 2.63 million barrels a day during
January and February, 4.9 percent lower than the daily average
for the full first-quarter of 2011, the San Ramon, California-
based company said in a statement today. Results for the full
three-month period will be announced on April 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending $3.2 billion last year to acquire
Appalachian gas producer Atlas Energy Inc., Chief Executive
Officer and Chairman John Watson is shifting the company&#8217;s focus
to finding crude and natural-gas liquids such as ethane that
sell at a premium to gas. Chevron will spend $32.7 billion this
year, a 12 percent increase from last year, on capital projects
including oil platforms, gas-export plants and refinery
equipment, the company said in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent crude futures, the benchmark for two-thirds of the
world&#8217;s oil, averaged $118.45 a barrel during the January-to-
March period, an 8.6 percent increase from the first-quarter
average and 12 percent higher than a year earlier, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. gas prices, weighed down by a glut of supply from
shale formations, tumbled to an average of $2.503 per million
British thermal units during the quarter, a 28 percent decline
from the prior period and 40 percent lower than a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron recorded a $200 million gain from the sale of so-
called downstream assets in Spain, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp., based in Irving, Texas, is the largest
U.S. energy producer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western Refining Inc. (WNR), the owner of
refineries in Texas and New Mexico, fell the most in more than
four months after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. predicted the price
difference between U.S. and international crude would start to
narrow in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Western fell 8.3 percent to $18.48 at the close in New
York. It was the biggest decline since Nov. 17, the day after
Enbridge Inc. and Enterprise Products Partners LP announced they
would reverse the Seaway pipeline to bring more crude from
Cushing, Oklahoma, to Texas refineries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reversed Seaway pipeline is expected to open by June,
making the price of West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S.
benchmark, closer to that of Brent oil, a global benchmark,
David Greely and Stefan Wieler, analysts with Goldman Sachs,
said today in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spread between Brent and WTI rose to $20.87 on April 4,
the highest point since the Seaway pipeline reversal was
announced, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The discount
narrowed 7.6 percent today in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Western operates refineries near new U.S. oil production,
which has surged to the highest level in 12 years and
oversupplied a storage hub at Cushing, reducing prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower WTI prices have allowed Western, HollyFrontier Corp. (HFC)
and other refiners with plants in the middle of the U.S. to pay
less to supply their facilities, boosting profit. In 2011,
Western had net income of $132.7 million, the highest since
2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HollyFrontier fell 6.2 percent to $29.58, the largest
decline since Nov. 23. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Natura Cosmeticos SA (NATU3), Latin
America&#8217;s largest cosmetics maker, will see faster sales growth
as it improves distribution, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Natura is going through an inflection point in sales,&#8221;
Andrea Teixeira, a senior analyst for the bank in New York, said
in an interview. &#8220;Sales will likely recover because of the
distribution and logistics initiatives in the past 12 months.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natura&#8217;s revenue increased 8.9 percent to 5.59 billion
reais in 2011 ($3.05 billion), according to data compiled by
Bloomberg, the slowest growth since at least 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares rose 3.8 percent to 41.50 reais at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo, the biggest advance on the Bovespa, which
fell 1.9 percent today. Natura has gained 14 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teixeira has a neutral rating on the shares and a December

&lt;p&gt;HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) hired JPMorgan

according to a person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laidler, who was head of Latin America strategy at
JPMorgan, will oversee HSBC&#8217;s research across all assets in the
Americas, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because he isn&#8217;t allowed to speak publicly on the matter.
Laidler, who will be based in New York and start in July, joined
JPMorgan in 2007 after working at UBS AG in Santiago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juanita Gutierrez, an HSBC spokeswoman in New York,
confirmed the appointment in a telephone interview. Patrick Boucher, HSBC&#8217;s current head of research for the Americas, will
continue in the company in a different role, Gutierrez said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Matthew Campbell and Christine Harper" date="Apr 10, 2012  1:59 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-10/goldman-sachs-says-mergers-co-head-zaoui-to-step-down-from-firm.html"><headline>Goldman Dealmaker Zaoui Retires From Firm After 24 Years</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Yoel Zaoui, named co-head of global
mergers and acquisitions at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) less than a
year ago, is leaving after 24 years at the bank, the eighth
management committee member to depart in 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zaoui, a 51-year-old French citizen, will continue to
advise the firm as a senior director, according to an internal
memorandum obtained by Bloomberg. The London-based banker, who
joined in 1988, got his current post alongside Gene T. Sykes,
54, in May, according to the memo from Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd C. Blankfein and President Gary D. Cohn. Jo Carss, a
spokeswoman in London, confirmed the contents of the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. based bank by assets,
is the fourth-ranked adviser on takeovers announced globally so
far this year after attaining the No. 1 position in 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Fees for takeover
advice and other financial advisory assignments fell 4 percent
last year and contributed 6.9 percent of the firm&#8217;s revenue,
according to the company&#8217;s results published in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zaoui is credited with helping to &#8220;establish the firm&#8217;s
leadership position across many markets and leading some of the
region&#8217;s most important merger transactions,&#8221; according to the
memo. &#8220;Yoel has built strong relationships with many of our
significant clients and has helped to recruit, mentor and
develop many of our senior banking professionals.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zaoui and his older brother Michael, who ran European MA
at Morgan Stanley before retiring in 2008 after a 21-year career
at the firm, became renowned in the late 1990s for their rivalry
on some of the biggest takeover battles. Among them were
TotalFina SA&#8217;s $58 billion purchase of Elf Aquitaine SA and
Vodafone AirTouch Plc&#8217;s $137 billion hostile bid for Germany&#8217;s
Mannesmann AG in 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Zaoui&#8217;s Deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zaoui also advised on deals including the 2004 merger that
created French pharmaceuticals maker Sanofi and the 2006
combination of Arcelor and Mittal. He didn&#8217;t reply to an e-mail
and phone message seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takeover advice was a bigger portion of revenue a decade
ago, contributing 16 percent of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s top line in 2000
and 17 percent in 1999, according to company reports. Sales and
trading, which generated 39 percent of 2000 revenue, swelled to
60 percent of 2011 revenue, according to company reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born in Morocco, Zaoui grew up in Rome and Paris, where he
was educated at HEC Paris and Universite Paris-Dauphine, and
received a master&#8217;s degree in business administration from
Stanford University&#8217;s Graduate School of Business before joining
Goldman Sachs in New York in 1988. He moved to London one year
later, where he helped build the company&#8217;s European mergers-and-
acquisitions practice under the leadership of John Thornton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Moving Up &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zaoui was promoted to co-head of European mergers in 1999,
the year that Goldman Sachs became Europe&#8217;s top adviser on
hostile takeovers, and in 2006 was promoted to run all of
European investment banking. In February 2008 he was among nine
Goldman Sachs executives named to the management committee. Five
of those partners including Zaoui are among eight committee
members who have left in the last 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard M. Ruzika, who joined in 1982, left the bank last
April and was followed later in the year by Yusuf A. Alireza,
Edward C. Forst and Kevin W. Kennedy. Edward K. Eisler, David B. Heller and Donald R. Mullen Jr.&#8217;s departures were all announced
earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excluding Zaoui, the management committee currently has 28
members. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The departures of Goldman Sachs bankers Luca Ferrari, who
advised Xstrata Plc on its proposed merger with Glencore
International Plc, and New York-based partners George Mattson

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) isn&#8217;t entitled to
protection from some asbestos claims related to its non-
operating bankrupt Quigley Co. unit, according to a federal
appeals court ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quigley, founded in 1916, made three products for the steel
industry from the 1940s to the 1970s that contained asbestos.
Pfizer bought Quigley in 1968, and the company stopped most
operations in 1992, filing for bankruptcy in 2004. Pfizer has
said it never made or sold any Quigley products, and some
claimants hadn&#8217;t released Pfizer from alleged &#8220;derivative
liability.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart Bernstein that found Quigley&#8217;s
bankruptcy barred certain lawsuits against Pfizer. A May 2011
decision in district court reversed the order, and Pfizer had
appealed that ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We affirm the district court,&#8221; three judges said in
today&#8217;s ruling that upheld the May decision. In doing so, they
found that the law firm Peter G. Angelos can sue Pfizer based on
manufacturer liability under Pennsylvania law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angelos began bringing lawsuits against Pfizer in 1999,
saying that because the drug company&#8217;s logo appeared on Quigley
products, it should have liability for the asbestos-containing
products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Evaluating Options &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher Loder, a spokesman for Pfizer, said the company
was disappointed in the court&#8217;s decision and is evaluating its
options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is important to note that the court&#8217;s ruling is
procedural and does not address the merits of the underlying
claims, which we strongly dispute,&#8221; Loder said: &#8220;In the
history of this litigation, Pfizer has never been found
derivatively or directly liable for injuries allegedly caused by
Quigley&#8217;s asbestos-containing products.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Quigley&#8217;s bankruptcy, a committee of creditors known
as the &#8220;Ad Hoc Committee of Tort Victims&#8221; asked in October
2010 to have Quigley&#8217;s bankruptcy dismissed so it could bring
tort claims, which are otherwise blocked by bankruptcy law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernstein had said that Pfizer had manipulated the
bankruptcy process, and refused to allow Quigley to exit Chapter
11 court protection under a deal with Pfizer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asbestos claims against Quigley may total $4.45 billion
during the next 42 years, according to testimony cited by
Bernstein in September 2011. In November of that year, Pfizer
reported a $701 million third-quarter charge for asbestos
litigation related to Quigley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the U.S. Trustee, an arm of the Justice
Department, had asked the bankruptcy court to end Quigley&#8217;s
Chapter 11, citing the fact that creditors alleging asbestos-
related health issues have been unable to sue New York-based
Pfizer during the case, and many of them have died. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Quigley Co., 04-15739, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The appeals
case is 11-2635, 11-2767, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. bought two North Sea
Forties (EUCSFORT) crude cargoes at higher prices, bringing its total
purchases for April-loading shipments to three. No bids or
offers were made for Russian Urals in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc resumed operation at its Valhall oil and natural-gas
field in the Norwegian North Sea after maintenance, according to
the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;North Sea &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron bought one Forties cargo for April 22 to April 24
loading from Vitol Group at 35 cents a barrel more than Dated
Brent (EUCRBRDT), and another for April 24 to April 26 from Royal Dutch
Shell Plc at a premium of 50 cents to the benchmark, according
to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the
Platts trading window. On April 5, a cargo for April 18 to April
20 was sold at 20 cents more than Dated Brent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley didn&#8217;t manage to buy Forties for May 1 to
May 6 loading at 25 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, the
survey showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trafigura Beheer BV was unable to sell Forties for April 27
to April 29 at 45 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, while
Total SA didn&#8217;t find buyers for May 2 to May 4 loading at 55
cents a barrel, according to the survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total also failed to sell Forties on a ship-to-ship basis
from the tankers Stena Natalita or Eagle Tuscon. It offered at
60 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent for April 20 to April 25
transfer, or a premium of 80 cents for April 24 to April 30,
according to the survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reported North Sea trading typically occurs during the
Platts window, which typically ends at 4:30 p.m. London time.
Before the session, Forties loading in 10 to 25 days was 34
cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, compared with a premium of
17 cents on April 5, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent for May settlement traded at $121.07 a barrel on the
ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, down from $121.23 yesterday. The June contract was at
$120.63, a discount of 44 cents to May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valhall is &#8220;back in production following the shutdown for
maintenance work,&#8221; Mark Salt, a London-based spokesman for BP,
said in an e-mailed response today. Output from the field
started on April 7 and is at normal levels of about 40,000
barrels a day of oil equivalent, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP shut the field at the end of March to repair a
compressor unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Forties cargo with parcel number F0414 was delayed by one
day to load from April 19., according to three people with
knowledge of the export program. This brings total deferrals for
this month to 10 lots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exports of North Sea Flotta crude will be 1.2 million
barrels in May, compared with 1.3 million barrels in April,
according to a loading schedule obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mediterranean/Urals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urals (EUCSURNW) was at $2.77 a barrel less than Dated Brent in
northwest Europe, compared with a discount of $3.58 in the
previous session, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
grade traded on April 5 at $2.80 less than Dated Brent for
delivery to Rotterdam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabian Oil Co. will supply full volumes in May to
customers in Europe, unchanged from this month, according to two
refinery officials with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;West Africa &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian Oil Corp. issued its first tender to buy crude for
loading in June, a document obtained by Bloomberg News showed.
The tender closes on April 11 and offers are valid until the
following day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bharat Petroleum Corp. sought to buy crude for loading from
June 1 to June 15, according to a separate tender document. It
closes on April 16, with offers valid until April 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigeria&#8217;s benchmark Qua Iboe (AFCSQUA1) blend was at a premium of
$2.36 a barrel to Dated Brent, down from $2.45 on April 5,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4), Brazil&#8217;s
state-run oil producer, reported a seep at its Roncador project
near the Chevron Corp. (CVX) field where 3,000 barrels leaked into the
Atlantic Ocean in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drops of crude were detected coming out of the seabed at
the Roncador area, Brazil&#8217;s petroleum regulator, known as ANP,
said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. Petrobras, as the Rio
de Janeiro-based company is known, confirmed the seep in a
separate statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spill at Chevron&#8217;s Frade field off Rio de Janeiro&#8217;s
coast last year, followed by a seep in the same area last month,
has triggered several probes against the U.S. oil producer and
rig operator Transocean Ltd. (RIG) in Brazil. Natural seeps are common
in oil-rich regions such as the Gulf of Mexico and the North
Sea, said Hernani Chaves, a geology professor at the Rio de
Janeiro State University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the whole world, where there are oil basins it is
common to have seeps along the sea floor,&#8221; Chaves said in a
telephone interview from Rio de Janeiro. &#8220;It could be coming
from Frade, it could be coming from Roncador.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron discovered the oil seep at the Roncador field,
operated by Petrobras, on April 7 while examining the ocean
floor near its Frade project and determined it was outside its
concession area, spokesman Kurt Glaubitz said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday. The U.S. oil producer halted 60,000 barrels
a day of production at Frade last month when it shut the field
as a precautionary measure while it studies seeps in the area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seep&#8217;s Origin &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ANP said it&#8217;s testing samples of the oil found at
Roncador to determine its origin and expects results within two
days. No oil from the leak has reached the surface, according to
ANP and Petrobras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roncador produced 284,000 barrels a day of oil and natural
gas in February, making it Brazil&#8217;s second-biggest producing
field after Marlim Sul. Both fields are located in the Campos
basin off Rio de Janeiro&#8217;s coast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutor Eduardo Santos de Oliveira is suing
Chevron and Transocean for 40 billion reais ($22 billion) for
the November and March leaks at Frade. He also pressed criminal
charges against 17 managers of the two companies in Brazil,
seeking penalties of as many as 31 years in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petrobras dropped 1.3 percent to 21.31 reais at 12:51 p.m.
in Sao Paulo. Chevron fell 1.5 percent to $101.92 in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fraud suit against JPMorgan Chase
 Co. (JPM) filed by German lender Bayerische Landesbank over losses
on about $2.1 billion in residential mortgage-backed securities
was moved to a federal court, according to a filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Munich-based bank, the second-biggest German state-
owned lender, sued in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan
on Nov. 21, accusing JPMorgan and units including Bear Stearns 
Co. of concealing the truth about the quality of the loans
underlying the securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was moved to U.S. District Court in Manhattan,
according to documents filed in the state court yesterday. The
move was proper because under federal banking law, federal
courts have jurisdiction over civil actions involving
transactions with foreign banks, New York-based JPMorgan said in
the court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bayerische Landesbank New York Branch v. Bear
Stearns  Co., 653239/2011, New York State Supreme Court, New
York County (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kazanci Holding AS, a Turkish group
with interests in energy and building, will invest as much as $3
billion in energy production by 2017 after agreeing to sell 13.3
percent of its Aksa Enerji Uretim AS (AKSEN) to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment will help Istanbul-based Aksa Enerji,
Turkey&#8217;s biggest non-government power producer, raise capacity
to 4,500 megawatts by 2017 from 2,036 megawatts at the end of
2011, Kazanci Deputy Chairman Cemil Kazanci said at a news
conference today in the Turkish city. About 60 percent of the
investment will be financed by loans, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kazanci signed an agreement today for a syndicated loan of
$400 million from Goldman Sachs, Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) and
Turkiye Is Bankasi (ISATR) AS. Goldman will provide $150 million of the
loan while Garanti and Isbank will supply equal amounts of the
remainder, the companies said in a joint statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will use almost half of the loan to strengthen the
investment capability of Aksa Enerji,&#8221; Kazanci said. The rest
of the funds will repay a $192 million bridge loan that the
family-owned, Istanbul-based holding company received from
Goldman last year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman will initially own 5.82 percent of Aksa Enerji
after paying $105 million, and the New York-based lender has
committed to buy another 7.48 percent for $135 million, Kazanci
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Loan Terms &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The syndicated loan, for which Kazanci&#8217;s 65.5 percent and
Goldman&#8217;s 13.3 percent stakes in Aksa Enerji will be used as
collateral, will mature in six years, with no payments required
during the first three years, Kazanci Holding said in a stock
market filing on April 6. Goldman may sell the Aksa Enerji
holding at any time during the maturity period, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aksa Enerji fell as much as 2.6 percent to 3.82 liras and
was trading down 1.8 percent at 4:18 p.m. in Istanbul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stake purchase will strengthen Aksa Enerji&#8217;s position
among international power producers, Dalinc Ariburnu, a London-
based board member of Goldman Sachs International, said at the
news conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kazanci Holding is looking at bidding this year when the
government revives canceled power-grid auctions, the deputy
chairman also said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aksa Enerji&#8217;s electricity sales to Syria will continue
under the contract it signed with Turkey&#8217;s southern neighbor
last year to provide 2 billion kilowatt-hours of power from a
500-megawatt capacity, Kazanci said. His comments came as
violence in Syria spilled across borders into Turkey and Lebanon
as President Bashar al-Assad&#8217;s regime spurned today&#8217;s United
Nations deadline for a cease-fire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a humanitarian matter and we have the contract
until June, so our sales will continue until then,&#8221; Kazanci
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Yukos Oil Co. owner Mikhail Khodorkovsky is pressing the U.S. to impose a visa ban and
freeze the assets of some 30 officials involved in the
imprisonment of a company lawyer who died after being denied
medical care in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vasily Aleksanyan, who had AIDS and developed cancer while
in jail, was imprisoned for more than 2 1/2 years until December
2008. The European Court of Human Rights had demanded his
release, saying that Russia violated several articles of the
European Convention on Human Rights by denying him specialized
treatment for AIDS. He died in October 2011 at the age of 39. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of U.S. senators last year proposed a bipartisan
bill that would impose a visa ban and asset freeze on 60 Russian
officials implicated in the death of anti-corruption lawyer
Sergei Magnitsky in a Moscow jail, as well as others guilty of
human-rights violations. Four senators last month said they
wouldn&#8217;t support an Obama administration effort to repeal trade
restrictions against Russia without support for the legislation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To ensure the deaths of both Aleksanyan and Magnitsky
were not in vain, actions must be taken against those
responsible for the abuses of their human rights,&#8221;
Khodorkovsky&#8217;s defense team said in an e-mailed statement from
New York. &#8220;This is the only way to achieve some justice for
victims and to dissuade further tragedies in Russia.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bill &#8216;Redundant&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama&#8217;s administration in July implemented
a visa ban on several Russian officials involved in the
Magnitsky case. The U.S. ambassador in Moscow, Michael McFaul,
who&#8217;s pursuing Obama&#8217;s &#8220;reset&#8221; policy of improving ties with
Russia, last month said the visa ban made the Magnitsky bill
&#8220;redundant,&#8221; according to a Foreign Policy report posted on
the envoy&#8217;s Twitter Inc. account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnitsky, a lawyer for London-based Hermitage Capital
Management Ltd., said he was abused and denied medical care in
an effort to force him to drop fraud allegations against
Interior Ministry officials before his death in November 2009
after almost a year in pretrial detention. He was facing
fabricated tax-evasion charges when he was beaten to death,
President Dmitry Medvedev&#8217;s human rights commission said in a
report last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Browder, head of Hermitage Capital, said in an
interview that the Aleksanyan case reinforced arguments for the
Magnitsky legislation, which describes the prosecution and
imprisonment of Khodorkovsky and other Yukos officials as
&#8220;politically motivated.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yukos Bankruptcy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khodorkovsky, 49, whose fortune was once estimated at $15
billion by Forbes magazine, was convicted of fraud and tax
evasion in 2005 and oil embezzlement in December 2010, charges
he says were revenge for his financing of opposition parties.
The tycoon, arrested in 2003, is serving 13 years in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yukos, once Russia&#8217;s biggest oil exporter, was declared
bankrupt in 2006, facing $30 billion of tax claims, and sold off
in pieces. State-owned OAO Rosneft controls most of its former
oil production and refining assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bipartisan group of senators on March 16 said in a letter
they were prepared to support repeal of the 1974 Jackson-Vanik
amendment, passed to punish the communist Soviet Union for
restricting Jewish emigration, if new legislation includes
&#8220;targeted sanctions on individuals who perpetrate gross
violations of human rights in Russia.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Repeal &#8216;Unconscionable&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republican Senators John McCain of Arizona and Roger Wicker
of Mississippi, Democrat Benjamin Cardin of Maryland and Joseph Lieberman, an Independent from Connecticut, signed the letter.
It was sent to Max Baucus, a Democrat who is chairman of the
Senate Finance Committee, and Orrin Hatch, the top Republican on
the panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate may take up legislation &#8220;within a couple of
months&#8221; to repeal Jackson-Vanik, Baucus said in a March 15
interview. Maintaining the law after Russia joins the World
Trade Organization later this year will penalize U.S. companies
doing business in Russia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Aleksanyan case, the Magnitsky case and hundreds of
others like it are now all widely accepted in Washington as good
reasons why it would be unconscionable to repeal Jackson-Vanik
without putting some other strong human-rights legislation in
place against Russia,&#8221; Browder said by phone yesterday from
London. &#8220;There is a preponderance of evidence that he was
deliberately and systematically denied medical care over a long
period of time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last September, Russian human-rights activists and
opposition politicians called on the U.S. Senate to blacklist
305 officials in Russia involved in the prosecution of Yukos and
Khodorkovsky. Two of 31 judges, investigators and prison
officials in the Aleksanyan case also feature among the 60
people linked to Magnitsky&#8217;s death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleksanyan was arrested on April 6, 2006, just six days
after being appointed executive vice president of Yukos to
handle relations with the court-appointed bankruptcy manager.
Embezzlement charges against him were dropped in June 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His death &#8220;was not an accident, but the product of cruel
and inhuman treatment he received at the hands of Russian
prosecutors and prison officials during a prolonged unlawful
imprisonment,&#8221; Khodorkovsky&#8217;s defense team said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world&#8217;s
largest entertainment company, formed a partnership with Tencent
Holdings Ltd. (700) and a Chinese state group to develop animation
content for the country and the international market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy Bird, chairman of Walt Disney International, signed an
agreement in Beijing with Tencent, China&#8217;s biggest Internet
company, and the Ministry of Culture&#8217;s China Animation Group,
the Burbank, California-based company said in a statement today.
Disney will help train local talent and develop original content
for television, movies and digital platforms, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February, the U.S. and China reached an agreement that
gives U.S. filmmakers improved access to a $2.1 billion box-office market in the world&#8217;s most populous nation. Tencent may
be able to benefit from the partnership by strengthening its
existing businesses such as online gaming, according to Bill Huang, a Shanghai-based analyst at DBS Vickers Securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;One of the things Tencent can do through this cooperation
is to foster animation-related intellectual property on its own
platforms,&#8221; said Huang. &#8220;But I can hardly see any meaningful
near-term earnings contribution.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China is one of the world&#8217;s fastest growing film markets.
In 2010, the Asia Pacific box office grew by 21 percent with
China accounting for 40 percent of the growth, the Motion
Picture Association of America said in February 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under today&#8217;s agreement, Disney will provide its expertise
in storytelling from concept creation and story development to
market research, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China said in December it will give tax breaks to emerging
&#8216;cultural&#8217; industries and has provided preferential tax policies
to animation and digital television companies. Greater
development of the media and cultural industries was set as a
national target in the government&#8217;s 12th five-year plan that
covers the period from 2011 through 2015. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. trader Bruno Iksil&#8217;s outsized bets in
credit derivatives are drawing attention to a little-known

debate over whether banks are taking excessive risks with
federally insured and subsidized money. &lt;/p&gt;

its staff of 400 who help oversee $350 billion in investments.
While the firm describes the unit&#8217;s main task as hedging risks
and investing excess cash, four hedge-fund managers and dealers
say the trades are big enough to move indexes and resemble
proprietary bets, or wagers made with the bank&#8217;s own money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trades, first reported by Bloomberg News April 5,
stirred debate among U.S. policy makers over the Easter-holiday
weekend as they wrangle over this year&#8217;s implementation of the
so-called Volcker rule, the portion of the Dodd-Frank Act that
sets limits on risk-taking by banks with government backing. The
law passed after the collapse of the subprime mortgage market
triggered the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. (INDU) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if the pro-Volcker folks used
this as a test case,&#8221; said Douglas Landy, a partner at law firm
Allen  Overy LLP who is representing Canadian banks in opposing
a current draft of the rule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Jeff Merkley criticized the transactions in a
statement that called for the rule&#8217;s prompt implementation,
while Representative Brad Miller said they show why related U.S.
laws should apply internationally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment on Iksil&#8217;s specific transactions, and Iksil
didn&#8217;t respond to phone messages and e-mails seeking comment.
Neither Iksil nor JPMorgan have been accused of wrongdoing, and
the full extent of his trading and the bank&#8217;s total risk of
loss, or total gain, on his investments isn&#8217;t known. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authorities will need more information from JPMorgan, the
biggest U.S. bank by assets, to discern the precise purpose of
Iksil&#8217;s transactions, said Clifford Rossi, an executive-in-
residence at the University of Maryland&#8217;s Robert H. Smith School
of Business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It clearly calls attention to the Volcker issue,&#8221; said
Rossi, who previously was a managing director at Citigroup Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rothstein Lawyer Charged With Illegal McCain Campaign Gifts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former associate of convicted Ponzi schemer Scott Rothstein was charged with illegally helping their law firm
become the largest contributor to the presidential campaign of
Republican John McCain in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorney Steven Lippman, 49, was charged with conspiring to
help Rothstein&#8217;s defunct law firm, Rothstein, Rosenfeldt 
Adler, illegally &#8220;bundle&#8221; contributions to McCain&#8217;s losing
campaign against President Barack Obama. He&#8217;s also accused of
conspiring to draw checks on accounts with insufficient funds
and to evade taxes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lippman is the eighth person accused of helping Rothstein,
a disbarred attorney serving 50 years in prison for the $1.2
billion Ponzi scheme he ran out of his law firm in Fort
Lauderdale, Florida. Rothstein pleaded guilty to racketeering,
money laundering and wire fraud in federal court in Fort
Lauderdale, where Lippman and the others were also charged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The breadth, scope, and sheer complexity of Rothstein&#8217;s
$1.2 billion Ponzi scheme is mind-boggling,&#8221; U.S. Attorney
Wifredo Ferrer said yesterday in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors charged Lippman, a shareholder at RRA with no
equity stake, with helping to &#8220;dramatically increase the
political influence and power&#8221; of the firm by serving as a
straw donor who was illegally reimbursed for his contribution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The charges speak for themselves,&#8221; Lippman&#8217;s attorney,
Bruce Zimet, said in a phone interview. &#8220;All of these acts do
not relate to the Ponzi scheme. Though they may have had some
effect on it, he was not a participant in the Ponzi scheme.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February, Toronto Dominion Bank (TD) agreed to settle a
lawsuit with investors who claimed it aided in the Ponzi scheme.
Barron&#8217;s and the Miami Herald reported that TD Bank would pay
$170 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Lippman, 12-cr-60078, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of Florida (Fort Lauderdale). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Royal Bank Chooses Court Battle With CFTC Over Wash Trades &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank of Canada has chosen to challenge the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission in court instead of settling over
allegations it engaged in illegal futures trades because it said
it didn&#8217;t break any rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was a conscious decision to defend ourselves
vigorously and we made that decision because we believe we
didn&#8217;t do anything wrong,&#8221; said Arthur Hahn, a Chicago-based
lawyer defending Canada&#8217;s biggest bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank is being sued by the regulator over claims it
engaged in illegal futures trades worth hundreds of millions of
dollars to garner tax benefits tied to equities. The Toronto-
based lender made false and misleading statements about &#8220;wash
trades&#8221; from 2007 to 2010 in which affiliates traded among
themselves in a way that undermined competition and price
discovery on the OneChicago LLC exchange, the CFTC said in a
complaint filed April 2 in Manhattan federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All of the transactions in question here were within
standard rules and the guidances put out by the commission,&#8221;
Hahn said in an interview. &#8220;We don&#8217;t think we did anything
wrong, it&#8217;s that simple.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank enlisted affiliates to help carry out hundreds
of futures transactions done off-exchange and then reported to
OneChicago as block trades between independent affiliates,
according to the CFTC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These were legitimate block trades, these were legitimate
trades between affiliates,&#8221; said Hahn, a partner with Katten
Muchin Rosenman LLP (1161L). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julie Dickson, who heads Canada&#8217;s Office of the
Superintendent of Financial Institutions, which is monitoring
the RBC case, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The only thing I&#8217;ll say about the Royal Bank case is,
when you look at the press releases, both sides are pretty
convinced that they&#8217;re right, so we&#8217;ll see how that plays out in
court,&#8221; Dickson told reporters after giving a speech in Toronto
April 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said while solvency regulators such as OSFI cooperate
and communicate with one another, securities regulators such as
the CFTC operate differently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In my experience, you don&#8217;t get warning,&#8221; Dickson said.
&#8220;If you do get advance notification, it&#8217;s virtually close to
the hour when something&#8217;s being announced. And that&#8217;s not
unusual. Securities regulators operate under a different
framework.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank has 60 days to file its statement of defense in
the U.S. court. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Icahn Sues Amylin Pharmaceuticals Over Board Election Rule &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc. (AMLN) was sued by billionaire
investor Carl Icahn over a corporate bylaw that hamstrings
investors from pursuing a proxy fight over a rejected a $22-per-
share takeover offer by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icahn contends that Amylin&#8217;s directors should be barred
from enforcing a rule requiring advance notice of candidates for
board seats since the drugmaker failed to make Bristol-Myers&#8217;s
bid public before the filing deadline. Amylin officials turned
down the $3.5 billion offer in February, two people familiar
with the bid told Bloomberg News on March 28. The company has
never confirmed the offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amylin directors have unfairly &#8220;rejected a request to
reopen the time for stockholders to provide notice&#8221; that they
seek to nominate candidates for board seats, Icahn, Amylin&#8217;s
third-largest shareholder, said in the lawsuit filed yesterday
in Delaware Chancery Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icahn, who has targeted at least seven drug companies in
the past five years, threatened to start a proxy fight over the
Amylin board&#8217;s rejection of the Bristol-Myers offer and urged
the drugmaker to pursue a sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe Mr. Icahn&#8217;s lawsuit is without merit,&#8221; Alice
Izzo, an Amylin spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement.
&#8220;Amylin&#8217;s board is fully aware of its fiduciary duties and is
committed to always acting in the best interests of all
stockholders.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Icahn Partners LP v. Amylin Pharmaceuticals
Inc., CA 7404, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;UBS Likely to Win Ouster of Billionaire&#8217;s Suit, Judge Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS AG (UBSN) will probably win dismissal of a lawsuit by
billionaire Igor Olenicoff over his claim that the bank bears
blame for his failure to declare $200 million in offshore
accounts on U.S. tax returns, a judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Andrew Guilford in Santa Ana,
California, yesterday issued a &#8220;tentative&#8221; opinion rejecting
Olenicoff&#8217;s lawsuit against Zurich-based UBS, the largest Swiss
bank. Olenicoff claimed it traded excessively in his accounts,
engaged in racketeering and committed fraud by not telling him
he owed U.S. taxes. He sought as much as $1.7 billion in
damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Olenicoff&#8217;s claim that he justifiably relied on UBS tax
advice is entirely inconsistent with his plea agreement,&#8221;
Guilford wrote in a 28-page opinion. &#8220;The tension between these
two inconsistent statements can be felt throughout Olenicoff&#8217;s
case.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olenicoff pleaded guilty in 2007 to filing a false tax
return, admitting he didn&#8217;t tell the Internal Revenue Service
about his offshore accounts for seven years. He was sentenced to
two years&#8217; probation and ordered to pay $52 million in back
taxes, fines and penalties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guilford said at a hearing yesterday that he expected to
issue a final ruling after considering further arguments from
Olenicoff&#8217;s attorney, Thomas Newmeyer. After the hearing,
Newmeyer declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Olenicoff v. UBS AG, 08-cv-1029, U.S. District
Court, Central District of California (Santa Ana). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Speeches &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bernanke Calls on Regulators to Limit Risks of Shadow Banking &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke called for new
steps to curb &#8220;shadow banking&#8221; operating beyond standard
oversight while saying the economy has far to go before fully
recovering from the credit crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The heavy human and economic costs of the crisis
underscore the importance of taking all necessary steps to avoid
a repeat of the events of the past few years,&#8221; Bernanke said
yesterday in a speech in Stone Mountain, Georgia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernanke supported efforts to increase the &#8220;resiliency&#8221;
of money market funds, referring to Securities and Exchange
Commission proposals to require firms to maintain capital
buffers or to redeem shares at the market value of underlying
assets rather than at a fixed price of $1. He also called for
efforts to monitor financial innovation and backed curbs on
intraday credit in tri-party repo markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An average of more than $2.8 trillion in securities was
financed during the market peak in 2008 through tri-party
transactions, many of which had short-term maturities. During
the first quarter of 2010, the value of securities financed by
tri-party repo had fallen to an average of $1.7 trillion,
according to New York Fed calculations based on Bank of New York
and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) data and cited in a May 2010 Fed paper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
in 2008, Bernanke flooded the financial system with liquidity by
opening facilities that provided credit to money market funds,
primary dealers, commercial paper markets, banks and other
borrowers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;About three and a half years have passed since the
darkest days of the financial crisis, but our economy is still
far from having fully recovered from its effects,&#8221; Bernanke
said in his only reference to the economy&#8217;s current condition.
He didn&#8217;t refer to current monetary policy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the 33,000 residents of
Cassino, the Italian town&#8217;s attempt to cut its borrowing costs
using derivatives was a losing bet the moment it was struck. The
Wall Street bank that created the deal reaped an instant profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cassino, flattened during World War II, signed a contract
with Bear Stearns Cos. (BSC) in 2003 to swap the fixed rates it was
paying on 22.5 million euros ($29.5 million) of debt for a
variable rate, according to documents obtained by Bloomberg News
last month under a court ruling. After the cost of the swap
spiraled, the town sued JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), which bought Bear
Stearns in 2008, and the bank paid to end the contract, leaving
Cassino with a 577,000-euro loss, more than half of what it pays
each year to provide free nursery care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documents give the most detailed account of how opaque
derivatives fashioned by securities firms are costing Italian
taxpayers more than $1.2 billion, according to estimates by the
country&#8217;s central bank. Firms such as JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank
AG (DBK) sold swaps to governments from Greece to Jefferson County,
Alabama, that offered the promise of cost savings while being
stacked in banks&#8217; favor. Cassino is now cutting nursery-care
funding and has raised charges for garbage collection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The deal wasn&#8217;t likely to make Cassino better off,&#8221; said
Satyajit Das, author of &#8220;Extreme Money: The Masters of the
Universe and the Cult of Risk&#8221; and a former Citigroup Inc. (C)
banker who reviewed details of the swap&#8217;s terms. &#8220;The city took
on a complex cocktail of risks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Initial Profit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contract generated an initial profit for the bank of
about 800,000 euros, according to a review of transaction
documents by Bloomberg LP&#8217;s BVAL derivatives-valuation unit. In
a separate analysis, Cambridge Systems Associates Ltd., a
financial consulting firm based in Cambridge, U.K., estimated
the profit at 690,000 euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reviews were based on documents provided by Cassino as
a record of the final contract with Bear Stearns in compliance
with a ruling by a regional administrative court in Latina,
Italy, that the papers be made available to the public under
freedom of information laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interest rate Cassino paid never dropped below 4.95
percent, even when market rates fell to less than that,
according to the contract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We lost money, and if there are ways to recover the
losses we will pursue them,&#8221; said Enzo Salera, Cassino&#8217;s
finance director. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Police Probe &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cassino stopped payments on the swap in 2008 and sued the
bank as Italy&#8217;s financial police began to probe the transaction.
The following year, New York-based JPMorgan paid the city
386,000 euros in compensation, more than three times the town&#8217;s
mark-to-market gain on the swap at the time, to end the contract
and the legal fight, the documents show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPMorgan Chase Bank&#8217;s involvement with this matter arose
from its subsequent acquisition of Bear Stearns in March 2008,&#8221;
a spokeswoman for the bank in Milan wrote in an e-mail.
&#8220;Neither party had made any admission of liability and the
underlying transaction has been terminated as part of the
settlement. Both parties considered the outcome to be mutually
advantageous.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement, details of which the city refused to
disclose for more than two years citing a confidentiality
agreement with the bank, may provide a template for other
municipalities trying to recoup losses from bets on derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Bad Practice&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The threat that the settlement arrangements by public
entities may one day become public is a deterrent to bad
practice and a further control of how public money is spent,&#8221;
said Dario Loiacono, a Milan-based securities lawyer who has
represented both banks and municipalities in swaps cases.
&#8220;However, there is an equally important interest of favoring
settlements by preserving the confidentiality of agreements and
attorney-client privilege.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cities from Milan to Pforzheim in Germany also are seeking
redress from banks that sold them derivatives that soured. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bankers from Bear Stearns met with city officials in May
2003, the documents show. A month later, the bank&#8217;s Nicola
Bonito Oliva and Alberto Guazzi wrote to Mayor Bruno Scittarelli
detailing the proposed terms of the swap, according to the
documents. The city didn&#8217;t seek competing bids from other firms,
papers filed by the municipality show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contract agreed to swap Cassino&#8217;s fixed-rate payment on
mortgages with Italy&#8217;s state-owned lender for a variable rate
tied to the 12-month U.S.-dollar London interbank offered rate,
or Libor (US0012M). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Extremely Risky&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an &#8220;extremely risky&#8221; deal given that dollar Libor
was at a record low, the police said in testimony to the Italian
Senate in June 2009. Dollar Libor climbed to an almost six-year
high of 5.76 percent in June 2006 from about 1.19 percent at the
time the contract was signed. By the time the city settled,
rates were still higher than when Cassino agreed to the swap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The town also bet that the cost of borrowing against dollar
rates would be lower than the cost of using euro rates as the
benchmark. In the two years before the deal was signed, dollar
Libor remained consistently lower than Euribor, a trend that
reversed in 2004, when dollar Libor started rising over a flat
Euribor, costing Cassino. Euribor, or the euro interbank offered
rate, is the rate at which European banks say they see each
other lending in euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scittarelli resigned as mayor in July 2010, and the city
was put under direct central government control until a
replacement administration was elected last year. He declined to
comment when reached by telephone, as did Bonito Oliva, the
former Bear Stearns banker who now works at S2R Ltd., a London-
based renewable-energy firm. Guazzi, who now works at Banca del
Ceresio SA, a private bank in Lugano, Switzerland, didn&#8217;t return
calls or respond to an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cassino&#8217;s Losses &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cassino, 80 miles southeast of Rome, gained in the first
year of the swap, according to BVAL and Cambridge Systems. Then,
as interest rates rose, Cassino started to owe the bank money,
beginning with the half-yearly payment due in December 2004. The
payments peaked at more than 500,000 euros in 2006. Over the
life of the swap, the city paid about 960,000 euros to the bank,
BVAL and Cambridge Systems said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when rates fell in June 2008 amid the financial crisis
and Cassino started making money on the derivative, its gains
were limited by a clause that meant its interest rate never
could fall below 4.95 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the mark-to-market loss for Cassino of as much
as 800,000 euros the day the deal was struck would have
translated into a gross profit for the bank. From that, the firm
would have to meet the costs of hedging the transaction and set
aside funds to cover counterparty credit risk, the possibility
that Cassino might default on the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns also paid a fee to &#8220;third parties for their
services&#8221; on the contract, the terms dated Aug. 5, 2003, show.
The documents don&#8217;t identify the recipients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Swaps Ban &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the contract drained Cassino&#8217;s coffers, town managers
stopped payments in 2008 and sued the bank. Italy&#8217;s finance
police estimated in 2009 that Cassino had paid as much as 2
million euros on the swap. An official at the federal auditor
for the Lazio region said he couldn&#8217;t comment on the difference
in the estimated losses because the probe is continuing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italy banned local governments from signing derivatives in
mid-2008 as lawmakers reviewed existing rules. Concern that many
municipalities misused swaps led legislators to hold a wider
inquiry in 2009 into their use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate committee proposed barring towns that aren&#8217;t
provincial capitals and have fewer than 100,000 residents from
using derivatives. Banks that act as counterparties to swaps
also would be prevented from advising towns on the suitability
of transactions. The legislation is pending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Milan, Pforzheim &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 2009, when JPMorgan agreed to cancel the deal,
the bet was in Cassino&#8217;s favor by about 100,000 euros, BVAL data
show. Cassino had sought 990,000 euros in compensation,
according to the documents. As part of the settlement, the town
dropped its claims in a Milan court for damages, and JPMorgan
agreed to abandon a separate suit at London&#8217;s High Court seeking
validation of the contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other cities also are seeking redress for derivatives.
JPMorgan, UBS AG, Deutsche Bank (DBK) and Depfa Bank Plc (DEP) agreed last
month to unwind interest-rate swaps with the city of Milan&#8217;s
government in a 455 million-euro transaction. The banks, on
trial for fraud, agreed to close the swaps at a gain for the
city. In Germany, the city of Pforzheim is seeking compensation
for losses of more than 56 million euros from JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Greek Swap &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alabama&#8217;s Jefferson County filed for the biggest municipal
bankruptcy in U.S. history in November after it defaulted on
debt backed by sewer revenue. The financial crisis had pushed up
the cost of its bonds, and swaps tied to the securities didn&#8217;t
shield it from rising expenses. Greece&#8217;s losses on a 2001 swap
with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) almost doubled to 5.1 billion
euros by 2005. The country is now in the process of the biggest
sovereign-debt restructuring in history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Transparency allows market forces to come in and act,&#8221;
said Christopher &#8220;Kit&#8221; Taylor, a former executive director of
the U.S. Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. &#8220;Banks would
come in and pitch a better deal if there&#8217;s poor pricing -- and
it avoids the Greek problem. Had the Greek swap been known, it
would have stopped other lenders giving it money.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Adriana Brasileiro" date="Apr 11, 2012  5:05 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-11/brazil-judge-denies-suspension-of-chevron-transocean-operations.html"><headline>Brazil Judge Denies Ban of Chevron, Transocean Operations</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;A Brazilian federal judge denied a
request from a prosecutor seeking to ban Chevron Corp. (CVX) and
Transocean Ltd (RIG). from operating in the country after two oil
spills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutor Eduardo Santos de Oliveira sought to halt
Chevron and Transocean&#8217;s operations in Brazil as part of a 20
billion reais ($11 billion) lawsuit for environmental damage
after an oil spill last month at its Frade field, according to
an e-mailed statement from the court today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legal action against Chevron comes as Brazil increases
scrutiny of offshore oil production following the 2010 Macondo
spill in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Chevron is also battling a
separate lawsuit by the country&#8217;s main oil union to ban it and
Transocean from operating in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron Brasil is confident that at all times it acted
diligently and appropriately, and in accordance with the best
practices in the oil industry,&#8221; the company said in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision refers to the second lawsuit targeting San
Ramon, California-based Chevron and Transocean for oil spills in
Brazil. Prosecutors filed the first lawsuit, also seeking 20

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS), after losing $200
million on the sci-fi film &#8220;John Carter,&#8221; is mounting a
superhero-style marketing campaign to ensure its next big-budget
movie, &#8220;Marvel&#8217;s The Avengers,&#8221; is a blockbuster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s interactive unit designed an online game, the
parks division covered a Florida monorail in ads and the Disney
XD cable network is running an &#8220;Avengers&#8221; cartoon, all to help
boost awareness of the film, which opens May 4 to kick off
Hollywood&#8217;s summer box-office season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s quite a contrast to another recent Disney effort,&#8221;
said Jeff Gomez, founder of Starlight Runner Entertainment, an
Internet consultant that works with studios. &#8220;There are a
number of elements that are unprecedented.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot is riding on &#8220;The Avengers,&#8221; the first Marvel film
Disney has marketed since buying the comic-book company for $4
billion in 2009. Under Rich Ross, the TV executive who became
studio chairman in October of that year, Disney has cut its
slate in half, betting on fewer films to boost profits. That
plan&#8217;s risk was underscored by &#8220;John Carter,&#8221; which will drag
the unit to a second-quarter loss of as much as $120 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Avengers&#8221; may generate domestic ticket sales of $155
million its opening weekend and $370 million in U.S. and
Canadian theaters, estimates Phil Contrino, editor of
BoxOffice.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Marketing Effort &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would be more than five times the domestic tally of
&#8220;John Carter&#8221; and a bigger opening than Lions Gate
Entertainment Corp. (LGF)&#8217;s &#8220;The Hunger Games&#8221; last month, the
third-largest debut of all-time at $152.5 million, according to
Box Office Mojo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any need to worry about this one,&#8221;
Contrino said in an e-mail. &#8220;It&#8217;s a sure thing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, rose 0.9 percent
percent to $41.37 at  the close in New York. The shares have
advanced 10 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Avengers,&#8221; about a team of superheroes battling to
save Earth, stars Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlett Johansson,
reprising their roles as Iron Man and the Black Widow from
2010&#8217;s &#8220;Iron Man 2.&#8221; That film posted $624 million in
worldwide ticket sales for distributor Paramount Pictures on a
budget of $200 million, according to IMDB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney spent an estimated $220 million producing &#8220;The
Avengers,&#8221; $30 million less than on &#8220;John Carter,&#8221; according
to the Internet Movie Database, a research website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Huge Failure&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is avoiding mistakes it made with &#8220;John
Carter,&#8221; said Peter Sealey, a former Columbia Pictures
executive who is now a consultant. He cited a &#8220;Carter&#8221; trailer
that didn&#8217;t excite viewers, a change in the studio&#8217;s top
marketing officer two months before the release and the removal
of the identifying words &#8220;of Mars&#8221; from the title. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was a huge marketing failure,&#8221; Sealey said, adding
Disney will &#8220;get the train back on the track.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney has been stoking interest in &#8216;The Avengers&#8217;&#8217; since
at least July 2010, when the stars and director Joss Whedon
appeared at the annual Comic-Con International convention in San
Diego. The film premieres today at the Disney-run El Capitan
theater in Los Angeles, before going into wide release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company gave away free screenings in 10 cities where
the most Facebook users signaled they liked the film. More than
1 million did so, according to the site. The trailers have
broken records for downloads on Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s ITunes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playdom, acquired by Disney in 2010 and part of the
interactive unit, created its first social game for a Disney
product. Introduced on Facebook Inc. (FB)&#8217;s site last month,
&#8220;Marvel: Avengers Alliance&#8221; has 640,000 daily users, according
to researcher AppData. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Avengers&#8217; on Rye &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney also lined up an estimated $100 million in
&#8220;Avengers&#8221;-related marketing by partners including Hershey
Co. (HSY), hotelier Wyndham Worldwide Corp. (WYN) and Honda Motor Co. (7267)&#8217;s
Acura, a record for Marvel, according to the trade publication
Variety. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Funk, senior vice president of sales and marketing at
Land O&#8217;Frost Inc., a Lansing, Illinois-based luncheon meat
maker, began discussing sponsorship packages with Marvel a year
ago. He declined to put a dollar figure on his company&#8217;s effort,
which include a sweepstakes for an &#8220;Avengers&#8221;-themed trip to
New York, supermarket displays, trading card giveaways and a TV
commercial with a superhero mom making a sandwich. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They told us this was going to be the biggest movie in
their entire portfolio,&#8221; Funk said in an interview. &#8220;We
figure: they&#8217;re going all out, we&#8217;ll go all out too.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harley-Davidson Inc. (HOG), the largest U.S.-based motorcycle
maker, produced a website where fans can design cartoon
characters and virtual motorcycles. In July, Harley and Marvel
will pick their five favorites, publishing them in online comic
books and giving the winners custom-made Harleys, according to
Dino Bernacchi, director of North American marketing
communications at the Milwaukee-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is experiential marketing and that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re
looking to do more of,&#8221; Bernacchi said in an interview. &#8220;Who
doesn&#8217;t want to be a part of comic history and what cooler way
to do it than riding in on a Harley?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sergey Aleynikov, the former
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) programmer who was freed after his
conviction for stealing computer code was overturned, didn&#8217;t do
anything to violate the federal laws prosecutors used to charge
him, an appeals court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals in New York, which had ordered
Aleynikov freed from prison in Fort Dix, New Jersey, in
February, today issued an opinion explaining its reasons. The
court said the two laws prosecutors used to charge Aleynikov, 
the National Stolen Property Act and the Economic Espionage Act, 
don&#8217;t apply to his case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We conclude that Aleynikov&#8217;s conduct did not constitute
an offense under either the NSPA or the EEA, and that the
indictment was therefore legally insufficient,&#8221; Chief Judge
Dennis Jacobs wrote in the opinion, on behalf of two members of
a three-judge panel. Judge Guido Calabresi filed a separate
opinion agreeing that Aleynikov didn&#8217;t violate the laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Russia, was
convicted in December 2010. He was serving an eight-year prison
sentence at the time his conviction was overturned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara
in Manhattan, declined to comment on today&#8217;s opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On his last day of work at New York-based Goldman Sachs in
June 2009, Aleynikov uploaded hundreds of thousands of lines of
source code from the firm&#8217;s high-frequency trading system,
prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He circumvented Goldman Sachs&#8217;s security, sent the code to
a server in Germany, compressed and encrypted it, and took it
with him to a meeting with new employers in Chicago, the U.S.
said. Prosecutors argued Aleynikov wanted it as a &#8220;cheat
sheet&#8221; to start a trading system at his new job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Aleynikov, 11-1126, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) is taking on Oracle Corp. (ORCL) and Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) with
server computers and software packaged and automated to reduce
the time and money clients spend on &#8220;scut work.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider built what
it calls PureSystems over four years, delivering server systems
that are easier to install, automate, update and manage, IBM
said in a statement. That frees information-technology staff to
work on more valuable, business-specific tasks, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is positioning PureSystems as an offering that
simplifies technology building blocks to compete with Oracle&#8217;s
Exadata and Cisco&#8217;s UCS and VCE products. The system may also
help IBM fend off competition to its hardware and software sales
from Web-based cloud-computing services by providers such as
Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), said John Rymer, a Forrester Research analyst. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re being challenged now by folks coming out with
cloud environments,&#8221; Rymer, who did research work related to
the project for IBM last year, said in a phone interview. &#8220;This
product line is a very significant attempt by IBM to provide a
competitive option to some of those cloud environments,
something that can be installed on premise.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software and hardware together made up more than 40 percent
of Armonk, New York-based IBM&#8217;s revenue of $107 billion last
year, with services accounting for almost all of the rest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cloud Threat &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM estimates companies use more than 70 percent of their
IT budgets managing and maintaining existing infrastructure,
said Steve Mills, IBM&#8217;s senior vice president and group
executive overseeing software and systems. To help reduce costs,
IBM is offering standardized configurations and pre-installed
application &#8220;patterns&#8221; that companies can build upon more
quickly than constructing their systems from scratch, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have this ability to mass-customize, to lower the cost
of computing,&#8221; Mills said in a phone interview. &#8220;Clients are
spending way too much money just trying to get things to work
properly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM identified the problem more than a decade ago when the
cost of getting server systems up and running surpassed the cost
of the hardware, Mills said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporations want &#8220;IT employees to spend more time
developing business services and less time on all the scut work,
the basic manual labor of getting stuff configured right,
getting it installed correctly, scaling it, raising the
capacity,&#8221; Rymer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An in-house option that needs less tech support from the
start may also be competitive against cloud services, Rymer
said. Corporations are migrating to cloud providers such as
Amazon&#8217;s Web Services, as they seek to run and store
applications in outside data centers instead of buying and
maintaining the servers and other hardware themselves. Forrester
has estimated that the market for cloud-computing services will
reach $61 billion by the end of this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM fell 1.3 percent to $202.33 yesterday. The stock has
advanced 10 percent this year, and on March 5 closed above $200
for the first time, factoring in stock splits. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;California-blend gasoline
strengthened against futures after the state said inventories of
the fuel fell 12 percent and Chevron Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s El Segundo refinery
reported an upset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend, or Carbob, stocks dropped 451,000 barrels
to 5.49 million in the week ended April 6, the lowest level
since Dec. 16, the state Energy Commission said in an e-mail
late yesterday. Chevron&#8217;s 279,000-barrel-a-day El Segundo (CTESCRUD) plant
reported an upset in a sulfur recovery unit yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in Los Angeles (MOGLDB85) rose
5.25 cents to a discount of 3.5 cents a gallon against futures
traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The fuel in Los Angeles previously fell
for two days straight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Francisco (MOGSD85P) Carbob jumped 6.25 cents to a 4.5-cent
discount to gasoline futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend, or CARB, diesel in Los Angeles (DIEILCAD) rose 1.5
cents to a premium of 8.5 cents a gallon against Nymex heating
oil futures. Inventories of the fuel tumbled 14 percent last
week to 2.03 million barrels, the lowest level since November
2010, the state said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Francisco (DIEISCAD) CARB diesel was unchanged at an 8.5-cent
premium versus futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in Portland (MOGHD87P), Oregon, rose
4.25 cents to reach parity with gasoline futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-sulfur diesel in Portland (DIEISTPD) dropped 9 cents to a 31-cent

&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s costs for
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson&#8217;s personal
use of company-owned aircraft increased sixfold in 2011,
according to a U.S. regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tillerson&#8217;s personal use of company planes cost $197,323
last year, compared with $29,409 in 2010, Irving, Texas-based
Exxon said today in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
filing. The expense was included in executive compensation
disclosures that showed Tillerson&#8217;s total compensation rose 17
percent to $34.9 million in 2011, including stock awards and
deferred compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increase in costs associated with Tillerson&#8217;s personal
use of company planes stemmed in part from escalating fuel prices
and maintenance expenses, as well as more trips, Alan Jeffers,
an Exxon spokesman, said today in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For security reasons, the board requires the chairman and
CEO to use company aircraft for both personal and business
travel,&#8221; Exxon said in the filing. The board &#8220;considers these
costs to be necessary, security-related expenses rather than
perquisites, but per the disclosure regulations we report the
incremental cost of aircraft usage for personal travel.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon rose 16 percent in New York last year as civil
conflicts in North Africa and the Middle East helped push Brent
crude prices to a full-year average above $110 a barrel. Profit
for 2011 jumped 35 percent to $41.1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will pay
$22 million to resolve U.S. regulators&#8217; claims that the firm
failed to implement policies to keep its stock analysts from
tipping select clients about upcoming research changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs held weekly huddles from 2006 to 2011 in
which analysts discussed short-term trading ideas and traders
shared their views of the markets, the Securities and Exchange
Commission said in a statement today. The meetings created &#8220;a
serious risk&#8221; that employees and clients could trade on the
non-public information, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Higher-risk trading and business strategies require
higher-order controls,&#8221; SEC Enforcement Director Robert Khuzami
said in the agency&#8217;s statement. &#8220;Despite being on notice from
the SEC about the importance of such controls, Goldman failed to
implement policies and procedures that adequately controlled the
risk that research analysts could preview upcoming ratings
changes with select traders and clients.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs paid a $10 million fine last year to resolve
similar claims from state regulators in Massachusetts and was
among 10 securities firms that paid disgorgement and civil
penalties totaling $1.4 billion to settle claims related to a
probe of analysts&#8217; conflicts of interest in 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased to have resolved this matter,&#8221; Goldman
Sachs spokesman Michael DuVally said today in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the settlement, Goldman Sachs will pay about $11
million to the SEC and the same amount to the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority, the Washington-based brokerage industry
regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Legislation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyst conflicts of interest garnered attention this month
after President Barack Obama signed legislation that critics
said will undo some rules emanating from the 2003 settlement.
Under the law, regulators are no longer able to write or
maintain rules that restrict investment bankers from arranging
communications between analysts and investors when dealing with
firms with less than $1 billion in gross annual revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, Goldman Sachs launched the Asymmetric Service
Initiative, a program in which research analysts called a select
group of about 180 hedge-fund and investment-management clients
to share information and trading ideas from the huddles, the SEC
said. The huddles and the program were an &#8220;extensive
undertaking&#8221; to improve the performance of the firm&#8217;s traders
and boost commissions from clients, according to the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research analysts&#8217; contributions to the huddles were
considered in their performance evaluations and could impact
their compensation, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Generate Profits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an administrative order filed today, the SEC cited an e-
mail from a Goldman Sachs manager that said employees had a
responsibility to generate trading ideas for huddles &#8220;based on
your view of the stocks that will move short term&#8221; and generate
profits for the trading desk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs traders who participated in the huddles were
primarily those who dealt directly with customers, including
market-making and client-facilitation traders from its
securities division, the SEC said. Until 2009, members of
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Franchise Risk Management Group, who were
authorized to establish large, long-term positions on behalf of
the firm, also attended the huddles, according to the order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The huddle program created a &#8220;serious and substantial
risk&#8221; that analysts would share material, non-public
information about their research with clients, many of whom were
frequent, high-volume traders, the SEC said. Goldman Sachs
failed to establish and enforce policies and procedures to
prevent misuse of the information, according to the agency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman, Sachs  Co. agreed to pay

Commission and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority claims
that the bank lacked adequate procedures to address the risk
that during weekly huddles, analysts could share material,
nonpublic information about upcoming research changes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, and its business partners OSI Pharmaceuticals Inc.
and Genentech Inc. sued Roxane Laboratories Inc. over its plans
to market generic copies of the lung-cancer drug Tarceva. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, based in New York; OSI, a unit of Tokyo-based
Astellas Pharma Inc. (4503); and Genentech, a unit of Roche Holding AG (ROG)
of Basel, Switzerland, contend Ingelheim, Germany-based
Boehringer AG (0205298D)&#8217;s Roxane has applied to the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration for permission to sell its version of Tarceva
before the patents expire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent owners, Pfizer and OSI, and licensee Genentech
&#8220;will be substantially and irreparably harmed&#8221; if a judge
doesn&#8217;t stop the infringement, their lawyers said in a complaint
filed today in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roxane, based in Columbus, Ohio, is facing another patent
suit filed April 10 in the same court. In that case, drugmaker
Abbott Laboratories contends Roxane is infringing patents for
the HIV drug Norvir. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angela Chirico, a spokeswoman for Roxane, said in an e-
mailed statement that the lawsuit is &#8220;an expected response&#8221; to
its abbreviated new drug application for a generic copy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Roxane Laboratories Inc. complies with all FDA
regulations and will not comment further on pending
litigation,&#8221; she added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is OSI v. Roxane, 12-cv-465, U.S. District Court,
District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) reported a 3.1
percent drop in earnings, a smaller decline than analysts
estimated as mortgage revenue surged and trading almost doubled
from the fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-quarter net income fell to $5.38 billion, or $1.31 a
share, from a record $5.56 billion, or $1.28, in the same period
a year earlier when there were more shares outstanding, the New
York-based company said today in a statement. Per-share profit
compared with an average estimate of $1.17 from 28 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56,
benefited from gains in mortgage lending as low interest rates
and federal incentive programs encouraged homeowners to
refinance. Mortgage fees and related revenue totaled $2 billion,
compared with negative revenue of $489 million a year earlier.
U.S. lenders made $318 billion in residential mortgages during
the first quarter, including $242 billion in refinanced loans,
according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is going to be a strong quarter for anyone who has a
big mortgage lending or trading business,&#8221; said Paul Miller, an
analyst at FBR Capital Markets, before results were released. He
said expanded federal programs to aid in refinancings have given
the market a boost. &#8220;It might be the best quarter in a long
time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) agreed to buy Varicent Software Inc., a Canadian provider
of analytics software to manage compensation and sales
performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toronto-based and closely held, Varicent automates and
integrates sales information, allowing companies to determine
compensation and sales-force deployment, IBM said in a statement
today. IBM, based in Armonk, New York, didn&#8217;t disclose terms of
the acquisition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider expects to
generate $16 billion of analytics revenue in 2015. Varicent
follows IBM acquisitions of companies, including Algorithmics
Inc., Clarity Systems, OpenPages, Cognos Inc. and SPSS as it
adds analytics tools to help businesses uncover trends and
better deploy their employees in sales, finance, customer
service and marketing. IBM&#8217;s five-year plan includes boosting
software to half of its total earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sales performance management is still viewed by many in
the industry as an art versus a science, but there is plenty of
opportunity for this mindset to change,&#8221; said Dan Shimmerman,
chief executive officer of Varicent. &#8220;As part of IBM, we can
now bring our technological expertise in maturing and advancing
the efficiency and effectiveness of the sales function to a
broader range of clients across the globe.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM fell 1.2 percent to $202.80 at the close in New York.
The shares have risen 10 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) labeled $3.3 billion of junior liens as bad assets
after regulators pushed the nation&#8217;s biggest banks to rethink
the value of second mortgages whose collateral has vanished. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo classified $1.7 billion of junior liens as
nonperforming in the quarter, leading to an increase in overall
soured loans, and JPMorgan gave that designation to $1.6 billion
of such loans, according to their first-quarter presentations
today. Both banks cited federal guidance for the change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators last year were examining whether lenders
were accurately valuing $845 billion of home-equity and other
second-lien mortgages and setting aside enough reserves,
according to people with knowledge of the matter. Holders of
second liens can be wiped out when home prices decline and a
borrower defaults because lenders holding first mortgages
typically are entitled to all the remaining collateral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve identified those high-risk seconds early, we put
reserves against them early, and so our reserves remain
unaffected,&#8221; Doug Braunstein, Chief Financial Officer of New
York-based JPMorgan, said on a conference call today with
analysts. Wells Fargo CFO Timothy Sloan said during his
conference call the impact on earnings at his San Francisco-
based bank was &#8220;immaterial.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) awarded
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein
$12.4 million in compensation for 2011, down 35 percent from a
year earlier, as the firm&#8217;s profit and stock fell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein&#8217;s pay included a $3 million cash bonus, $7
million in restricted stock, $2 million in salary and $449,600
in other benefits, according to a proxy statement today from the
New York-based firm. Last year it granted him $19.1 million,
including $5.4 million in cash, $12.6 million in restricted
stock, a $600,000 salary and $464,100 in benefits for 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, set
Blankfein&#8217;s compensation after earnings dropped 47 percent, the
stock tumbled 46 percent and the firm eliminated 2,400 jobs. His
pay compared with a $10.5 million package awarded to Morgan
Stanley (MS) Chairman and CEO James Gorman, $15 million granted to
Citigroup Inc. (C) CEO Vikram Pandit and $23 million for JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That decrease from the prior year is pretty consistent
with what we&#8217;ve seen in the industry,&#8221; said Joseph Sorrentino,
a managing director at Steven Hall  Partners, a compensation-
consulting firm in New York. &#8220;The tracking of the stock price
to the payout may not always line up, but it should over the
long term.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the largest U.S.
oil producer, and Russian energy company OAO Rosneft (ROSN) will
present details of their $3.2 billion joint-exploration
agreement to analysts in New York on April 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson,
Rosneft CEO Eduard Khudainatov and Igor Sechin, Russia&#8217;s deputy
prime minister, will make presentations at the event, Exxon said
on its website today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In exchange for gaining access to billions of barrels of
crude in the Russian sectors of the Arctic Ocean and Black Sea,
Exxon will grant Rosneft the right to invest in Texas shale
fields and deep-water projects in the Gulf of Mexico, according
to a joint statement issued when the agreement was announced in
August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, replaced BP Plc (BP/) as Moscow-
based Rosneft&#8217;s partner in the Arctic exploration project after
the U.K. explorer&#8217;s billionaire partners in the TNK-BP Holding (TNBP)
venture blocked the agreement last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian President-Elect Vladimir Putin yesterday proposed
tax breaks to help make foreign investment in the nation&#8217;s oil
industry more profitable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The export duty for new offshore projects may be canceled
and the extraction tax may be set at 5 percent of the
hydrocarbon sales price for some Arctic offshore fields, Putin
said yesterday in Moscow during a meeting of government and
energy industry officials. Incentives may be granted for as long
as 15 years from the start of production, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Wells
Fargo  Co. (WFC), the two most profitable U.S. banks last year,
reported first-quarter earnings that topped analysts&#8217; estimates
on a surge in mortgage fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s earnings per share climbed to $1.31 from $1.28 a
year earlier, while Wells Fargo posted net income of 75 cents
per share, up from 67 cents. Those results beat analysts&#8217;
estimates of $1.17 and 73 cents per share, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo had its highest mortgage banking fees since
2009 and JPMorgan set a record for home-loan production income
amid gains from the government&#8217;s Home Affordable Refinance
Program and interest rates that fell to a record low. Both banks
benefited from the lowest net charge-offs since the financial
crisis as delinquencies fell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mortgage has been pretty strong over the last quarter or
so,&#8221; David George, a bank analyst at Robert W. Baird  Co.,
said in an interview on Bloomberg Radio&#8217;s Bloomberg
Surveillance. &#8220;The mortgage business nationally here in the
U.S. has really consolidated and the players that have benefited
from that, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo among others, are really
going to benefit from that this quarter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, both banks faced higher charges related to mortgage
lawsuits and repurchase claims. JPMorgan set aside $2.5 billion
more toward its litigation costs during the first quarter mostly
for mortgage-related disputes. Wells Fargo set aside $430
million to cover mortgage repurchase claims, an increase over
the $404 million in the fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fixed Income &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue at Wells Fargo climbed 6.4 percent to $21.6
billion, more than the $20.4 billion forecast by analysts.
JPMorgan&#8217;s revenue rose 6 percent to $26.7 billion from $25.2
billion during the first quarter of last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo&#8217;s costs also advanced, with non-interest
expenses climbing about 2 percent to $13 billion amid higher
compensation and legal spending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank said quarterly costs will fall to $11.25 billion
by the end of the year, the high end of Chief Executive Officer
John Stumpf&#8217;s stated goal for reducing expenses to between
$10.75 billion and $11.25 billion. Costs will fall by as much as
$700 million in the second quarter, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retail banking at JPMorgan, which includes home loans and
checking accounts, earned $1.75 billion, up from $533 million in
the fourth quarter and a loss of $399 million a year earlier.
The net interest margin, which measures the profit margin on
lending, declined to 2.61 percent from 2.89 percent a year
earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mortgage Business &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand for loans rose as the unemployment rate fell to 8.2
percent at the end of March from 8.9 percent a year ago.
Mortgage originations likely climbed 5.3 percent to $318 billion
in the first quarter from the same quarter last year,
driven by strong refinance activity, according to the Mortgage
Bankers Association. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue at JPMorgan&#8217;s investment-banking unit didn&#8217;t match
last year&#8217;s near-record $8.23 billion, falling 11 percent to
$7.32 billion. It gained 68 percent from the fourth quarter as
financial markets in Europe stabilized. Revenue from fixed-
income and equity trading, almost doubled from the fourth
quarter and beat estimates from analysts including Atlantic
Equities&#8217; Richard Staite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the investment bank, you saw very strong flows in the
underlying customer businesses in both fixed-income and equity
markets,&#8221; Chief Financial Officer Doug Braunstein said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has transformed the bank&#8217;s chief
investment office in the past five years, increasing the size
and risk of its speculative bets, according to five former
executives with direct knowledge of the changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achilles Macris, hired in 2006 as the CIO&#8217;s top executive
in London, led an expansion into corporate and mortgage-debt
investments with a mandate to generate profits for the New York-
based bank, three of the former employees said. Dimon, 56,
closely supervised the shift from the CIO&#8217;s previous focus on
protecting JPMorgan from risks inherent in its banking business,
such as interest-rate and currency movements, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of Macris&#8217;s bets are now so large that JPMorgan
probably can&#8217;t unwind them without losing money or roiling
financial markets, the former executives said, based on
knowledge gleaned from people inside the bank and dealers at
other firms. Bruno Iksil, a London-based trader in Macris&#8217;s
group, gained attention last week after moving markets with his
trades, drawing a comparison to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke&#8217;s power in the government-bond market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What Bernanke is to the Treasury market, Iksil is to the
derivatives market,&#8221; Bonnie Baha, head of the global developed
credit group at DoubleLine Capital LP in Los Angeles, where she
helps oversee $32 billion, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategists at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
lowered their recommendation on U.S. investment-grade corporate
bonds to neutral from overweight, saying that uncertainty about
Europe&#8217;s fiscal crisis will limit returns for the debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s Eric Beinstein, head of the New York-based
bank&#8217;s top-rated high-grade strategy team, said in a report
today that the extra yield the bonds pay more than similar-
maturity Treasuries is unlikely to tighten much in the next few
months as the European situation weighs on investor demand.
Beinstein still expects spreads to drop to 175 basis points by
the end of the year, from about 200, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe renewed uncertainty in peripheral Europe will
limit the ability of spreads to tighten meaningfully over the
next couple of months,&#8221; Beinstein wrote in the report. That
will counter expected positive developments in the Chinese and
U.S. economies, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors have been scooping up corporate bonds this year
on optimism that borrowers will have an easier time meeting
their debt payments amid signs the global economy is recovering.
The extra yield, or spread, over Treasuries that investors
demand to hold highly-rated U.S. corporate bonds fell to 201
basis points yesterday from 257 basis points at the end of last
year, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beinstein&#8217;s team ranked No. 1 for investment-grade
strategists in Institutional Investor magazine&#8217;s annual poll. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frank Bisignano smiled as he met
actress Debra Messing last night at the Brooklyn Academy of
Music&#8217;s 150th Anniversary Gala. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Are you from Brooklyn?&#8221; Bisignano, a native of the
borough&#8217;s Mill Basin, asked. Yes, the &#8220;Smash&#8221; star said before
posing for a photo. Bisignano&#8217;s wife, Tracy, a fifth-grade
school teacher, hustled into the last frame. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s (JPM) chief administrative officer
-- in charge of everything from technology to real estate to
global security for businesses in 60 countries -- and chief
executive of mortgage banking appeared on stage as emissary of
Chase, the sponsor of BAM&#8217;s 150th anniversary year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bisignano, honorary corporate chairman of the gala,
reminisced about the old neighborhood and noted that Chase has
1.2 million customers in the city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the mention of &#8220;Chase,&#8221; a small portion of the
audience booed, and expressed their desire to get on with the
show (three people had spoken, and there was still a video to
come). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mood lifted as soon as New Orleans master Dr. John
processed down the aisle with a romping horn section in tow,
with Bisignano and JPMorgan spokesman Joe Evangelisti rising
from their seats and dancing with the rest of the audience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&#8217;t the only highlight of his week. Today JPMorgan
beat estimates with its first-quarter earnings, on gains from
mortgage lending. Its 3.1 percent net-income drop was a smaller
decline than analysts estimated. Bisignano has turned around the
mortgage unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Go-to Manager &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Frank is the go-to manager at JPMorgan,&#8221; Dick Cashin,
managing partner at One Equity Partners LLC, which is owned by
JPMorgan Chase, said in an interview at an April 9 gala for
Ballet Hispanico. &#8220;He&#8217;s the guy brought in to fix things. He&#8217;s
the culture carrier of a bank managed not by bankers and traders
but by businessmen and businesswomen.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cashin joined Bisignano at the gala, where JPMorgan was a
lead sponsor. There, in the Plaza Hotel&#8217;s ballroom, Bisignano
sat with Giants wide receiver Victor Cruz. He didn&#8217;t join Cruz
in his signature end-zone dance, with music provided by the
Spanish Harlem Orchestra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He can dance to the two songs we danced to at our
wedding,&#8221; his wife said. These were &#8220;You Can Make Me Free&#8221; by
Billy Joel and &#8220;Songbird&#8221; by Fleetwood Mac. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he demonstrated last night, he can also dance to funk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another bright spot in the week was an announcement that
the 100,000 Jobs Mission, which is committed to hiring 100,000
veterans by 2020, has hired more than 12,000 veterans. Bisignano
is a founding member of the coalition and JPMorgan Chase has
made more than 4,000 of those hires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Long-term success,&#8221; Bisignano said in a statement,
&#8220;requires that we put as much effort into assimilating,
retaining and promoting veterans as we do on recruiting and
hiring them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the positive-economic-indicators department, two Fifth
Avenue luxury boutiques threw parties last night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Salvatore Ferragamo, Beyonce&#8217;s sister, Solange Knowles,
spun music to celebrate the store&#8217;s renovation. Women will shop
on the ground floor, men on the second floor, in an environment
incorporating white Venetian plaster, dark oak and stone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Red Shoes &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s amazing what renovation can do,&#8221; Massimo Ferragamo,
chairman of Ferragamo USA Inc., said. &#8220;Things really stand out
now and people can see better, touch better and, hopefully, buy
better.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One tempting item: a pair of red and gold shoes displayed
in a glass case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re an inspiration from some of my father&#8217;s
creations, which are in our museum in Florence,&#8221; Ferragamo
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Cartier opened an exhibition celebrating Aldo
Cipullo, the house&#8217;s designer who made the Love bracelet in 1969
and the first nail bracelet in 1971. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cartier may be &#8220;Parisian, French, 1847,&#8221; as Emmanuel
Perrin, president and chief executive officer of Cartier North
America, said. The exhibition, however, shows the influence of
industrial New York on the house. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkish actress Bade Iscil was on hand. Beyonce, Jay-Z and
LCD Soundsystem&#8217;s James Murphy attended the after-party
downtown. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank by assets, is &#8220;very conservative&#8221; in investing the
firm&#8217;s excess cash, said Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We create deposits around the world, and we&#8217;re very
conservative,&#8221; Dimon said today in a conference call with
reporters after the New York-based firm reported first-quarter
earnings. &#8220;The portfolio does change over time as we change our
views.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bruno Iksil, a London-based trader in JPMorgan&#8217;s chief
investment office, built positions in contracts linked to the
value of corporate debt that market participants said were so
big that they moved the market. JPMorgan&#8217;s chief investment
office has been transformed in recent years by Dimon into a unit
that makes bigger and riskier speculative bets with the bank&#8217;s
money, five former employees said this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holdings in the chief investment office include about $70
billion of European mortgage-linked debt, said Dimon, 56. The
bank&#8217;s regulators can see everything the company does whenever
they want, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm has more money from deposits than it has extended
in loans and it invests the difference, about $360 billion, &#8220;in
a variety of very high-grade securities,&#8221; Chief Financial
Officer Douglas Braunstein said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s investment
bank set aside $2.9 billion for employee compensation in the
first quarter, 12 percent less than a year earlier, as revenue
slipped 11 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expense, which includes salaries, bonuses and benefits,
was enough to give each of the division&#8217;s 25,707 employees an
average of $112,849 for their work in the first three months of
this year, according to figures posted today on the New York-
based company&#8217;s website. The unit set aside $3.29 billion to pay
traders, dealmakers and other personnel, or $124,330 for each of
the 26,494 people on staff, in 2011&#8217;s first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bank had 292 fewer people on March 31
than at the end of the fourth quarter and 787 fewer than a year
earlier, according to today&#8217;s disclosure. JPMorgan, the largest
U.S. bank by assets, boosted total staff 8 percent over the last
12 months to 261,453. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jes Staley, 55, chief executive officer of JPMorgan&#8217;s
investment bank, set aside about 40 percent of the division&#8217;s
revenue for pay in the first quarter, the same proportion as in
the year-earlier quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income for the division fell 29 percent to $1.68
billion from the previous year. The investment bank generated 31
percent of JPMorgan&#8217;s $5.38 billion in profit, down from 43
percent a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leung is leaving for &#8220;personal and family reasons,&#8221; and

Microsoft Germany, the company said in a statement today. Gordon Frazer, managing director of Microsoft U.K., will take over as
chief operating officer for greater China from Michel van der
Bel, who is moving into Frazer&#8217;s U.K. role, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haupter, a former executive at International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM), will lead Microsoft&#8217;s efforts to combat software
piracy and boost sales of Windows Phone smartphones in China,
the world&#8217;s second-biggest economy. Almost four out of five
computer programs used in China are pirated, according to data
from the Business Software Alliance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;China represents an unprecedented opportunity for growth
across the breadth of our business,&#8221; Jean-Philippe Courtois,
president of Microsoft International, said in the statement.
Haupter will report to Courtois, Microsoft said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leung will leave his position at the end of the month, and
will serve as an adviser until August, Charles Shen, a Microsoft
spokesman in Beijing, said by telephone today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The percentage of software in China that is pirated dropped
to 78 percent in 2010, the Business Software Alliance said in
its annual report in May last year. The annual commercial value
of software pirated in the country was $7.78 billion, according
to the group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greater China region covers mainland China, Taiwan and
Hong Kong, according to Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management
Chairman Jim O&#8217;Neill said China&#8217;s decision to widen the yuan&#8217;s
trading band for the first time since 2007 increases his
confidence that the Chinese economy will cool only gradually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It adds to my confidence in a soft landing,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill
said in an email today. The change is positive for equities
because it shows reformers are &#8220;in charge,&#8221; while &#8220;for FX it
just means more volatility,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Neill coined the term BRIC in 2001 to describe Brazil,
Russia, India and China. He predicted in a March 16 interview
with Bloomberg Television that the Chinese government would
allow bigger swings in the currency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world&#8217;s
largest entertainment company, plans to co-produce &#8220;Iron Man
3&#8221; with Beijing film studio DMG Entertainment as collaborations
between Hollywood and Chinese studios increase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie will have an investment of at least 1 billion yuan
($158 million), DMG Chairman Peter Xiao told reporters in
Beijing yesterday. The Chinese company will invest in the
production and help distribute it in China, Burbank, California-based Disney said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partnership is the latest in a wave of U.S.-Chinese
deals as Western operators look for a larger role in one of the
world&#8217;s fastest-growing movie markets. The 2010 remake of ''''Karate 
Kid,'''' starring Jackie Chan and Jaden Smith, was produced by Sony''s 
Columbia Tristar and state-owned China Film Group. While China 
limits the number of foreign films allowed into the country, pictures 
co-produced with Chinese partners can skirt the quotas. China also
has adjusted the revenue-sharing formula, giving foreign studios
a bigger share of ticket sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement marks a milestone as &#8220;the first multibillion
dollar franchise to be produced between Hollywood and China,&#8221;
said Dan Mintz, chief executive officer of DMG. Chinese elements
will be added to the film, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LifeLock Inc., an online provider
of identity-theft protection services, is exploring an initial
public offering, Chief Executive Officer Todd Davis said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tempe, Arizona-based company is talking to banks
including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
about handling the IPO to sell a 10 percent to 15 percent stake,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The IPO market looks intriguing,&#8221; Davis said in an
interview. &#8220;We don&#8217;t have a sense of urgency, and aren&#8217;t locked
into any one path yet.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2005, LifeLock provides its 2.2 million users
with fraud protection for $10 to $25 a month. Membership is
surging more than 10 percent a year, Davis said, keeping pace
with growth in reported crimes and the market for services to
deflect would-be offenders. LifeLock, along with ID Analytics
Inc., a company it acquired last month, had revenue of more than
$200 million in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is likely to seek a valuation of as much as 7
times sales, according to a person with knowledge of the matter,
who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are
private. An IPO filing may come within the next year, this
person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 11.6 million U.S. adults were victims of identity
fraud last year, according to Javelin Strategy  Research. The
market for identity and access management services reached $3.7
billion in 2010, according to consulting firm RNCOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If identity theft happens, we try to help and work with
the bank, the IRS, whoever,&#8221; Davis said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll spend $1
million.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Opportunities for Acquisitions&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of LifeLock&#8217;s sales come from analytic tools that help
more than 280 corporate clients, including payday loan
providers, predict the likelihood of fraudulent transactions.
LifeLock bought ID Analytics for an undisclosed sum to expand
into these theft-prevention services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More deals are possible, Davis said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ll still continue to look for emerging technologies,&#8221;
Davis said. &#8220;I certainly think there will be opportunities for
acquisitions going forward.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LifeLock has raised about $200 million from investors
including Bessemer Venture Partners, Goldman Sachs and Kleiner
Perkins Caufield  Byers (ZZISK), Davis said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company may be worth about $1 billion, or about five
times annual revenue, said Tom Taulli, who runs IPOPlaybook.com
in Newport Beach, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This would be attractive in the public markets,&#8221; because
it has recurring revenue, Taulli said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gene Yoon, a managing director at Goldman Sachs, is on
LifeLock&#8217;s board of directors, which also includes Google Inc.&#8217;s
former Chief Financial Officer George Reyes and Tom Ridge,
former U.S. secretary of homeland security. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trulia Inc., an Internet startup
focused on residential real estate, hired JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) to manage its initial public offering,
according to two people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco-based company is likely to go public in
the second half of this year and will be valued at less than $1
billion, said the people, who declined to be named because the
talks are private. Trulia is also working with Class V Group&#8217;s
Lise Buyer, who advises startups on IPOs, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trulia, a rival to Zillow (Z) Inc., provides a search engine
used by over 20 million people a month to look for homes in
specific neighborhoods. It also offers reviews on local schools
and crime rates. The company makes money through ads on the site
and subscriptions that let real estate agents target users and
get their listings featured prominently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trulia is capitalizing on the best stretch of Internet IPOs
in more than a decade, with LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD), Groupon Inc. and
Zynga Inc. all going public in the past year. Trulia is
following the lead of fellow real estate website Zillow, which
went public in July and has since jumped 77 percent to a
valuation of almost $1 billion. While Zillow has more revenue,
Trulia is growing faster, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ken Shuman, a spokesman for Trulia, declined to comment, as
did JPMorgan representative Jennifer Zuccarelli and Deutsche
Bank&#8217;s Duncan King. Buyer said she doesn&#8217;t disclose which
companies she&#8217;s working with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Staffing Up &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trulia has been bolstering its executive ranks. In
December, it hired Sean Aggarwal, former vice president of
finance at EBay Inc.&#8217;s PayPal unit, as chief financial officer.
The company also named former Imperva Inc. executive Scott Darling as general counsel. Early last year, it hired former
Yahoo! Inc. executive Paul Levine as its operating chief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Pete Flint co-founded the company
in 2005 with Sami Inkinen, Trulia&#8217;s president. Trulia has raised
$33 million from investors, including Sequoia Capital, Accel
Partners and Fayez Sarofim  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trulia hasn&#8217;t disclosed its revenue or profit. Sales at
Seattle-based Zillow, meanwhile, more than doubled last year to
$66.1 million. It reported net income of $1.1 million, following
a loss of $6.77 million the prior year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     April 16 (Bloomberg) --Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and MetLife
Inc. (MET) agreed to disclose information about the race and gender of
their workforces at the request of New York City&#8217;s pension
funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman will release the demographics in a June report,
while MetLife will publish the data on its website, Comptroller
John C. Liu said in a statement. He called on other New York-
based companies, including American International Group Inc. (AIG) and
Omnicom Group Inc. (OMC), to make such information available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The requests are part of an effort by Liu and the city
pension funds to expand opportunities for women and minorities
to obtain management-level jobs in financial services and
advertising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Many companies say they are making serious efforts to
recruit, retain and promote women and minorities,&#8221; Liu said.
&#8220;Without quantitative disclosure, shareowners have no way to
evaluate the effectiveness of these efforts.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As comptroller, Liu serves as investment adviser and
trustee of five New York City pension funds valued at $115
billion as of Dec. 31. Combined, the funds hold more than 1.2
million Goldman shares, 2.3 million MetLife shares, 708,906
Omnicom shares and 1.1 million AIG shares, according to Liu&#8217;s
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of women and minorities holding management-level
jobs in finance didn&#8217;t substantially increase from 1993-2008,
according to Liu&#8217;s statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, white men held 64 percent of management positions
in the financial industry, while women held 27 percent,
according to the statement. Together, women and minorities held
less than 10 percent of executive positions at financial firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A diverse and inclusive work force has been an ongoing
focus for MetLife, and we have made steady progress over the
years,&#8221; said Frans Hijkoop, MetLife executive vice president,
human resources, said in the Liu statement. &#8220;At the same time,
we are continuing to make additional strides to promote
diversity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement on disclosing diversity data was reported
earlier today by the New York Times. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s private
equity funds are selling a stake in Industrial  Commercial Bank
of China (601398) Ltd. to Temasek Holdings Pte (TMSK) in their largest
divestment of stock in the world&#8217;s biggest bank by market value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funds affiliated with Goldman Sachs are selling $2.5
billion of shares at HK$5.05 each, according to a term sheet.
Temasek, the Singapore state-owned investment group that is
increasing stakes in China&#8217;s biggest banks, said it was buying
3.55 billion shares, or 4 percent of ICBC&#8217;s Hong Kong-traded
shares. The holding would cost $2.3 billion, based on the per-
share price and stake size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Bank of
America Corp. were among foreign banks that spent a combined $22
billion between 2004 and 2006 to purchase stakes in Chinese
lenders ahead of their initial public offerings. Goldman Sachs,
which owns ICBC stock directly and through private equity funds
managed by the firm, has generated $3 billion in gains on ICBC
since the fourth quarter of 2006, according to company filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The ICBC stocks have done well for them,&#8221; Sandy Mehta,
chief executive officer at Hong Kong-based Value Investment
Principals Ltd., said by telephone today. &#8220;You&#8217;ll continue to
see sales of Chinese bank stocks by these banks. It&#8217;s a
continuation of the trend. It&#8217;s been happening now for a year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of ICBC have rallied more than 40 percent since
hitting a 2 1/2-year low in October as concern eased that
Europe&#8217;s debt crisis would lead to a further economic slowdown
in China. The MSCI China/Financials Index, which includes ICBC,
has tripled in value in the past eight years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price of Goldman Sachs&#8217; stake is a 3.1 percent discount
from the HK$5.21 close of ICBC shares on April 13. The stock
fell 9 percent from its Feb. 29 peak this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shares Fall &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICBC shares dropped 0.8 percent to HK$5.17 at the close of
trading in Hong Kong, the first decline in three days. The stock
trades at 6.4 times estimated earnings, down from a multiple of
9.9 a year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale is the fourth and biggest by value for New York-
based Goldman Sachs. The U.S. securities firm raised $1.1
billion in November selling shares in ICBC at HK$4.88 each. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal represents about 40 percent of Goldman Sachs&#8217; 8.78
billion shares of ICBC as of Dec. 31, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. As of Dec. 31, Goldman Sachs owned $4.71 billion
of ICBC stock on its own balance sheet, down from $7.59 billion
a year earlier, according to the New York-based company&#8217;s annual
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and funds affiliated with Goldman Sachs
remain ICBC&#8217;s second-biggest holder of H shares, based on the
shareholding data of the Chinese lender&#8217;s Hong Kong-traded
stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Healthy Profit&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s stake in Beijing-based ICBC generated a $517
million pretax loss in 2011 compared with a $747 million gain a
year earlier, the firm disclosed on Jan. 18. Goldman Sachs,
which acquired its ICBC stock in 2006, doesn&#8217;t report other
individual stock investments in Asia in its annual filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investment banks need a healthy profit,&#8221; said Mehta. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t think Goldman needs the capital as much as others. It&#8217;s
certainly not urgent to have a distressed sale on the part of
Goldman, but it just reflects they need a healthy profit from
this transaction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Temasek has been increasing holdings in China Construction
Bank Corp. (939) and Bank of China Ltd. (3988) as global lenders divest. It
bought 3.77 billion shares of China Construction Bank from Bank
of America on Nov. 11, increasing its stake in the second-
largest Chinese lender by value, and raised its investment in
Bank of China, the nation&#8217;s fourth biggest, to 7.07 percent from
6.96 percent after buying 97.1 million shares in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;The Lifeline&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Temasek&#8217;s underlying strategy is investing in growth
areas like China and key sectors like banks and this is
essentially an opportunity that came up,&#8221; said Song Seng Wun, a
regional economist at CIMB Research Pte in Singapore. &#8220;Asia is
likely to lead the growth in the near-to-middle term, so all
these deals are essentially to anchor that, and banks are
basically the lifeline and heart of any economy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Singapore investment fund, which managed S$193 billion
($154 billion) as of March 2011, said in a statement today that
the purchase will give it a deemed interest of 5.3 percent in
the Hong Kong-listed shares of ICBC, which includes stakes held
by its units and associates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICBC widened its lead as the world&#8217;s most profitable lender
last month after reporting a 17 percent increase in fourth-
quarter net income. The percentage of financial services
companies in Temasek&#8217;s holdings rose to 36 percent from 35
percent as of March 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C) last month sold its entire stake in Shanghai
Pudong Development Bank Co. nine years after the purchase for an
after-tax gain of $349 million. Bank of America sold 10.4
billion shares of China Construction Bank in November for a
profit of about $1.8 billion, leaving it with a 1 percent stake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Strategic Investments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overseas firms touted the strategic nature of their
investments and pledged to work with their Chinese counterparts
on everything from risk management to information systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will continue to reduce its stake in ICBC
because of the capital required to be held against the
investment, said Michael Werner, a senior banks analyst at
Sanford C Bernstein  Co. in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank &#8220;purchased its stake in ICBC when it was a
broker-dealer,&#8221; said Werner. &#8220;Now that it is a bank holding
company, which means higher capital requirements and subject to
the Dodd-Frank rule, it is much less attractive to hold its
stake in ICBC.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs converted to a bank holding company and
accepted $10 billion in government rescue funds in 2008. The
Dodd-Frank Act subjects the largest banks to higher capital
requirements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oak Hill Advisors LP, a U.S. asset
manager focused on high-yield bonds and distressed debt, hired
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s Doug Henderson to lead its performing
credit business in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henderson worked for Goldman Sachs in London, where he
served as chairman of the bank&#8217;s European Credit Finance Group,
New York-based Oak Hill said in a statement today. He became a
partner at Goldman Sachs in 2004 and oversaw its restructuring,
high-yield debt, structured finance and real-estate finance
businesses in Europe, the Middle East and Asia, Oak Hill said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 50 partners departed New York-based Goldman Sachs
between January 2011 and January 2012. The executives left amid
declining earnings and increased regulation of U.S. banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henderson succeeds Richard Munn, who will step down as a
full-time Oak Hill employee at the end of 2012, the company said
in the statement. Munn will become a senior adviser starting in
2013, assisting Oak Hill on its European investments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, and its business partners OSI Pharmaceuticals Inc.
and Genentech Inc. sued Roxane Laboratories Inc. over its plans
to market generic copies of the lung-cancer drug Tarceva. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, based in New York; OSI, a unit of Tokyo-based
Astellas Pharma Inc. (4503); and Genentech, a unit of Roche Holding AG (ROG)
of Basel, Switzerland, contend Ingelheim, Germany-based
Boehringer AG (0205298D)&#8217;s Roxane has applied to the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration for permission to sell its version of Tarceva
before the patents expire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent owners, Pfizer and OSI, and licensee Genentech
&#8220;will be substantially and irreparably harmed&#8221; if a judge
doesn&#8217;t stop the infringement, their lawyers said in a complaint
filed in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roxane, based in Columbus, Ohio, is facing another patent
suit filed April 10 in the same court. In that case, drugmaker
Abbott Laboratories contends Roxane is infringing patents for
the HIV drug Norvir. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angela Chirico, a spokeswoman for Roxane, didn&#8217;t have an
immediate comment on the lawsuit, saying she needed to confer
with Roxane officials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is OSI v. Roxane, 1:12-cv-00465, U.S. District

&lt;p&gt;No money changed hands in the settlement, the two companies
said. Under the agreement each company will have rights to make
golf ball and golf club products under patents owned by the
other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other details of the settlement weren&#8217;t disclosed. The two
companies have been involved in patent disputes over golf balls
since 2006, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fila acquired Acushnet, the maker of Titleist golf
equipment in May 2011 from Fortune Brands Inc., now Beam Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Daniel Boulud&#8217;s Restaurant Group Sues Buffalo Bar &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A restaurant company affiliated with celebrity chef Daniel
Boulud sued a Buffalo, New York bar for trademark infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boulud&#8217;s Manhattan-based Dinex Group LLC accused the
operators of Duke&#8217;s Bohemian Grove Bar of infringing the
&#8220;DBGB&#8221; trademark it used with restaurant and bar services.
According to the complaint filed April 10 in Manhattan, Dinex
has used the mark continuously since June 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the Dinex properties in New York is the DBGB Kitchen
 Bar. Among the others are Daniel and Caf&#233; Boulud. Boulud was
awarded three Michelin stars and the James Beard Award for an
outstanding restaurant for Daniel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dinex said it contacted the Buffalo bar&#8217;s owners in August
2010 and asked them to quit using the &#8220;DBGB&#8221; designation.
According to the complaint, counsel for Buffalo group said in
September 2010 that it would quit using &#8220;DBGB&#8217; on its signs and
advertising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit was filed because Dinex &#8216;&#8216;became aware&#8217;&#8217; that the
Buffalo group was still using the DBGB designation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owners of the Buffalo property didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to an e-mailed seeking comment on the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dinex asked the court to order the defendants to halt their
alleged infringement and for an order for the seizure and
destruction of all offending promotional materials.
Additionally, the company seeks awards of the Buffalo group&#8217;s
profits flowing from the alleged infringement, money damages,
attorney fees and litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The restaurant company asked that the damages be tripled
and that additional damages be levied to punish the defendants
for their actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Dinex Group LLC v. Pat Duquin, 1:12-cv-02767-
LTS, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;I Believe You Zimmerman&#8217; Registration Sought by San Franciscan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A San Francisco resident has applied to register &#8216;&#8216;I
believe you Zimmerman&#8221; as a trademark, according to the
database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application, filed March 30, specifies that Lawrence
Sekara plans to use the mark on aloha shirts, camouflage shirts,
athletic uniforms, apparel for dancers, beer mugs, caps and
hats, bumper stickers and stickers for helmets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sekara told the Smoking Gun gossip website that while he
has no affiliation with George Zimmerman, that he&#8217;d share some
of the revenue from the sale of the trademark items with
Zimmerman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George Zimmerman is the Florida resident who was charged
with second-degree murder April 11 in connection with the
shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. He shot Martin on Feb.
26 in Sanford, a central-Florida town of 54,000 people north of
Orlando. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florida&#8217;s &#8220;Stand Your Ground&#8221; law enables individuals who
feel threatened in a public place to &#8220;meet force with force,&#8221;
rather than back away, a statute that strengthens any
traditional self-defense assertion, criminal attorneys said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law prevented police from arresting Zimmerman in
February, officials said at the time, and may play a role in
derailing the prosecution, according to Florida defense lawyers,
who said the defendant may be able to raise the issue both
before, and during, any trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Smoking Gun website, Sekara said he
thought that the public &#8220;jumped to too many conclusions&#8221; about
the shooting. He has also registered a domain name,
Ibelieveyouzimmerman.com that hasn&#8217;t gone live. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Megaupload Data Ruling Deferred by Judge for Further Talks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A U.S. judge deferred a decision on whether millions of
gigabytes of data belonging to users of Megaupload.com should be
preserved or the data-storage company that owns the servers
where it&#8217;s housed can delete it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Liam O&#8217;Grady, at a hearing April 13 in
Alexandria, Virginia, told federal prosecutors they have two
weeks to work out an agreement with parties claiming an interest
in the massive cache of data that became inaccessible when law
enforcement agents shut down Megaupload in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parties include attorneys for the Motion Picture
Association of America, who said the files contain the largest
collection of copyright-infringed material in the world, as well
as attorneys for Megaupload, who argue they need the data to
defend the company&#8217;s directors against charges including
criminal copyright infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors this month said in court papers they already
had a large sampling of the data cache and will provide it to
defense attorneys. They contend the data need not be preserved
for purposes related to the criminal prosecution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julie Samuels, an attorney for the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, an Internet civil liberties group, argued that the
government should establish a system through which those users
could file affidavits and claim their data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a system would be difficult. The more than 1,000
servers on which the data had been stored have been unplugged
and shipped to a warehouse in Virginia, according to Marc Zwillinger, an attorney for Carpathia Hosting Inc., the Dulles,
Virginia-based hosting company that Megaupload paid to store its
users&#8217; data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carpathia was paid $35 million over several years by
Megaupload, prosecutors said. Zwillinger said Carpathia simply
provided a platform to its client, and should no longer be
required to pay for the data&#8217;s upkeep. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carpathia agreed to sell the servers to Megaupload for $1.2
million, a cost the company was willing to incur as part of the
defense of Dotcom and other company directors, Zwillinger said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jay Prabhu, the chief of the cybercrime unit in the U.S.
attorney&#8217;s office in Alexandria, told O&#8217;Grady that the MPAA
objects to returning the copyright-infringed material to a
company that helped illegally disseminate it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigators in January executed more than 20 search
warrants in the U.S. and eight other countries and seized about
$50 million in assets associated with Megaupload.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Dotcom, 1:12-00003, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of Virginia (Alexandria). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ocean Tomo, Former Official Settle Trade Secret Dispute &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade secrets case that Ocean Tomo LLC, a self-
described intellectual property merchant bank, filed against the
former president of its PatentRatings unit has settled,
according to an April 10 court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit, filed in federal court in Los Angeles Jan. 27,
accused Steve Lee of downloading Ocean Tomo data from a company
laptop and saying he would disclose this information to Jonathan
Barney and Barney&#8217;s company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee was president of PatentRatings until his resignation in
September. Before he came to Ocean Tomo, Lee was a management
consultant for the Boston Consulting Group, and before that, a
design engineer at Hughes Aircraft Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barney, a patent lawyer who was the inventor of the Patent
Ratings system, left Ocean Tomo in February 2011, following a
dispute over the company&#8217;s expansion plans, according to a
posting on the Intellectual Asset Management magazine blog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barney is the holder of patent 6,556,992, which covers the
patent-rating system that he had licensed to Ocean Tomo. He was
sued by Ocean Tomo in Illinois state court Jan. 27, accusing him
of breach of contract, and destruction of the company&#8217;s
confidential information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to an April 3 court order, Lee is barred from
disclosing Ocean Tomo trade secrets. This includes &#8220;attorney-
client communications and attorney work-product of Ocean Tomo&#8221;
related to a dispute with Patent Ratings that is presently in
proceedings before the American Arbitration Association. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court excluded from its order information that Lee had
that he could demonstrate was known to him from sources other
than Ocean Tomo, that he developed independently without
violating his employment agreement, or that he could demonstrate
is generally known to technology or intellectual property
professionals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case against Lee is Ocean Tomo LLC v. Steve Lee, 8:12-
cv-00146-JVS-MLG, U.S. District Court, Central District of
California (Santa Ana). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IP Moves &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Suzanne Barnett Named Chief Judge, Copyright Royalty Board &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Librarian of Congress has named a state court judge
from Washington State as chief judge for the copyright royalty
board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suzanne Barnett, who presently services as a King County
Superior Court Judge, will take her new post May 20, according
to a statement from the Library of Congress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board sets rates for sound recording performance
royalties for Internet and satellite royalties, and rates paid
to the various collecting societies and the distribution of
funds collected from cable and satellite television for
rebroadcast of copyrighted programming on broadcast television. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnett is appointed to a six-year term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She has an undergraduate degree from the College of William
and Mary and a law degree from Washington and Lee University. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should be &#8220;underweight&#8221;
Asian currencies and bonds this quarter because deteriorating
economies in the region and Europe will bolster demand for
dollars, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The clear implication of weak European and Asian growth
with no large scale U.S. quantitative easing is a stronger
dollar,&#8221; strategists including Hong Kong-based Bert Gochet and
New York-based Ying Gu wrote in a report dated April 13.
&#8220;Further large-scale inflows to emerging bond markets make
little sense at these levels without a clear case for currency
appreciation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index (ADXY) fell the most in
four weeks after the cost of insuring Spain&#8217;s bonds against
default surged to a record last week, with 10-year bond yields
approaching the 7 percent levels that forced Greece, Ireland and
Portugal to seek bailouts. China&#8217;s economy, which is second only
to the U.S. in size, expanded 8.1 percent from a year earlier in
the first quarter, the slowest growth since mid-2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said economic data in the current quarter will
continue to paint &#8220;an unclear picture&#8221; in China, while the U.S.
will no longer display as strong signs of recovery as it did in
the first three months of 2012. Concerns about Europe &#8220;will re-
surface in a meaningful way,&#8221; according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rupiah, Ringgit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within Asia, the biggest U.S. bank recommended investors
hold less Indonesian rupiah and Malaysian ringgit than benchmark
indexes suggest, and also underweight local-currency government
bonds in Malaysia and Thailand. In addition, it advised using
interest-rate swaps in Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and China
to profit from a steepening of the yield curve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank announced a new trade for South Korea that
involves paying a two-year interest-rate swap at 3.49 percent
against the three-month certificate of deposit, which is
currently 3.54 percent. The swap declined two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, today to 3.48 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan estimated there is a 30 percent chance of a third
round of bond purchases by the Federal Reserve, a non-consensus
view in the market based on a Bloomberg survey of primary
dealers. The Fed has announced two rounds of quantitative easing
to hold borrowing costs down since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Beth Jinks" date="Apr 17, 2012  7:51 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-17/ibm-raises-2012-forecast-as-earnings-top-estimates-sales-miss.html"><headline>IBM Raises Forecast After Net Income Rises; Sales Miss</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider, raised
its full-year earnings forecast after posting a 7.1 percent
increase in first-quarter profit, helped by software margins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating earnings will increase to at least $15 a share
this year, IBM said today, boosting its January forecast of at
least $14.85. Analysts predicted $14.92, the average of
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company also reported
revenue for last quarter that fell short of projections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is making progress with a plan to make software, which
is more profitable than hardware, account for half of earnings
as businesses and governments boost spending on programs that
analyze data and project trends. Consulting was hurt by Japan&#8217;s
recovery from last year&#8217;s earthquake and tsunami, as well as
constrained government budgets all over the world, Chief
Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The major markets continued to be weighed down by Japan
and by the public sector, which declined more sharply this
quarter&#8221; in terms of business services demand, Loughridge said
on a conference call. &#8220;The growth markets continued to perform
well, with double-digit growth again this quarter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loughridge reiterated that he expects the company&#8217;s
performance to improve in the second half. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Bottom Line&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The top line and likely the bottom line should be
stronger in the second half,&#8221; Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at
Sanford C. Bernstein  Co., said in a phone interview after the
earnings release. &#8220;The comparisons get a lot easier and they
are going to have some benefits from the cost cutting,&#8221; said
Sacconaghi, who has a market perform rating on the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM fell 2.4 percent to $202.56 in extended trading, after
rising 2.3 percent to $207.45 at the close. Last month, the
Armonk, New York-based company&#8217;s shares closed above $200 for
the first time, factoring in stock splits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales increased 0.3 percent to $24.7 billion, compared with
the $24.8 billion analysts predicted. Net income advanced to
$3.07 billion, or $2.61 a share, from $2.86 billion, or $2.31, a
year earlier. Earnings excluding some items rose to $2.78 a
share from $2.41. Analysts predicted $2.65. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from Europe, Middle East and Africa declined 2
percent to $7.6 billion, while sales in the Americas and Asia-
Pacific region increased. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect on IBM&#8217;s revenue growth from Europe&#8217;s debt
crisis may worry some investors, said Joseph Foresi, an analyst
at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Boston, who has a buy rating
on the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Growth Markets &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro averaged $1.31 in the first quarter, down 4.2
percent from the year-earlier period as Europe&#8217;s financial woes
continued. The drop means revenue from Europe, which combined
with Middle East and Africa accounts for about a third of IBM&#8217;s
sales, is worth less when converted to dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Virginia &#8220;Ginni&#8221; Rometty, who
took over in January, is also seeking to expand in faster-
growing economies. Revenue from growth markets, such as Brazil,
India and China, increased 9 percent in the first quarter. Sales
from the regions will make up at least 30 percent of revenue by
2015, the company has said, up from 22 percent in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formerly IBM&#8217;s sales and marketing head, Rometty, 54,
succeeded Sam Palmisano and became the first female CEO in the
company&#8217;s 100-year history. Palmisano, who had been CEO since
2002, remains chairman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hardware Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rometty inherited a five-year plan that targets annual
operating earnings of at least $20 a share by 2015, up from
$13.44 last year. IBM is tapping a &#8220;gusher of data&#8221; through
its Smarter Planet and Smarter Commerce initiatives to achieve
its 2015 growth targets, Rometty said in her first letter to
shareholders in the 2011 annual report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales at IBM&#8217;s software unit rose 5.5 percent to $5.6
billion. Services revenue growth slowed to 0.7 percent from the
fourth quarter&#8217;s 3 percent, while hardware sales declined 6.7
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backlog, which measures expected future revenue from
contracts, totaled $139 billion in the quarter, down $2 billion
from the fourth quarter. Contract signings for services were
$11.8 billion. Mark Moskowitz, an analyst at JPMorgan  Chase
Co., projected $11.1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has set goals of adding $20 billion in new revenue and
spending about $20 billion on acquisitions, from 2010 through
2015, as it expands offerings to business customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loughridge today reiterated that acquisition goal on a
conference call, and said IBM spent $1.3 billion in the first
quarter closing purchases of five companies, including DemandTec
Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is selling its point-of-sale terminal business for
about $850 million to Toshiba Tec Corp. (6588), the Japanese maker of
scanners and bar-code machines, the companies said earlier
today. That deal is a &#8220;partnership&#8221; that will allow IBM and
Toshiba to combine some offerings in commerce, Loughridge said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) won a court order
directing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to reconsider
its denial of a bid to charge market rates on oil carried
through the Pegasus pipeline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency&#8217;s decision to reject the request was
&#8220;unreasonable&#8221; because the Illinois-to-Texas pipeline doesn&#8217;t
have the ability to control the market for transporting Canadian
crude, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled today. The 858-mile
(1,381-kilometer) system handles 3 percent of the 2.2 million
barrels Western Canada produces daily, the court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The record shows that producers and shippers of Western
Canadian crude oil have numerous competitive alternatives to
Pegasus for transporting and selling their crude oil,&#8221; the
three-judge panel said, returning the issue to the agency for
reconsideration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobil Pipeline, a unit of Irving, Texas-based Exxon Mobil,
asked FERC for permission to charges uncapped rates in 2007. The
decision may affect other pipeline operators that have announced
plans to ship Canadian crude to the U.S. Enbridge Inc. (ENB) and
Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD) have requested the same type of
rate structure for their Seaway system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon is &#8220;pleased with the decision,&#8221; Patrick Henretty, a
spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. He declined to comment
on the case&#8217;s impact on other pipelines. The Pegasus line
carries about 66,000 barrels of oil a day, according to the
court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Refined Products &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tamara Young-Allen, a spokeswoman for the commission,
declined to comment on the ruling. The agency hasn&#8217;t allowed
market-based rates on oil pipelines, although it has allowed
them on lines that ship refined products such as gasoline, she
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike standard rates, pipelines with market-based rates
can charge whatever the market will bear and change their rates
without prior approval from the commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil producers challenged Pegasus&#8217; request, saying it would
give the pipeline operator too much control over transportation
prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency denied Exxon&#8217;s request after concluding it had
the ability to manipulate rates on Pegasus above competitive
levels for a significant period of time because of the lack of
competition, the court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The commission jumped the rails by treating the Pegasus
pipeline as the rough equivalent of a bottleneck or essential
facility for transportation of Western Canadian crude,&#8221; Circuit
Judge Brett Kavanaugh wrote for the court. &#8220;The record
thoroughly undermines FERC&#8217;s conclusion.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Rate Seekers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the five years since Pegasus applied for the rate, two
other pipelines have been announced that would carry Canadian
crude to refiners on the U.S. Gulf Coast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TransCanada Corp. (TRP)&#8217;s Keystone XL pipeline would carry about
830,000 barrels a day from Canada&#8217;s oil-sands region to the
Gulf. Enbridge plans to ship 850,000 barrels a day to Texas
using its Canadian Mainline system and the Seaway pipeline,
which it co-owns with Enterprise, the biggest U.S. pipeline
operator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enbridge and Enterprise have applied for a market-based
tariff on the Seaway pipeline, which connects an oil-storage hub
at Cushing, Oklahoma, with refineries in Houston. The request
has has drawn protests from more than a dozen oil producers and
trade groups. TransCanada hasn&#8217;t said what rates it will seek on
the Keystone line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court&#8217;s decision on the Pegasus pipeline could affect
how the commission decides Seaway and other pipeline tariff
requests, said Jack Semrani, an attorney with Ballard Spahr LLP
in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;More Careful&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full impact won&#8217;t be known until the agency decides
whether to appeal, said Semrani, who represents a group
protesting the Seaway tariff request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If FERC doesn&#8217;t appeal this and this becomes the law,
then FERC is going to have to be more careful in withholding
market-based rates,&#8221; Semrani said in a phone interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TransCanada hasn&#8217;t applied for rates on the Keystone line
and can&#8217;t speculate what form they might take, Shawn Howard, a
TransCanada spokesman, wrote in an e-mailed message. Rick
Rainey, a spokesman for Enterprise, declined to commented on the
company&#8217;s tariff request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Mobil Pipeline Co. v. Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, 11-1021, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, said profit fell 23 percent
as revenue from trading bonds, currencies and commodities lagged
behind Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-quarter net income dropped to $2.11 billion from
$2.74 billion a year earlier, the New York-based bank said today
in a statement. Earnings per share of $3.92 beat the $3.55
average estimate of 24 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The bank
boosted its quarterly dividend 31 percent to 46 cents a share,
the first increase since 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, led by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, reported a 20 percent decline in fixed-income trading
revenue to $3.46 billion and cut the size of its market bets to
the lowest level since 2006. JPMorgan&#8217;s revenue from that
business fell 11 percent to $4.66 billion and Citigroup, No. 3
by assets, reported a 4 percent drop in fixed-income trading to
$3.65 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Although earnings actually beat consensus, I think that
the results look somewhat disappointing in comparison with the
strong numbers we&#8217;ve seen out of JPMorgan and Citigroup,&#8221;
Richard Staite, an analyst at Atlantic Equities LLC in London,
said in a telephone interview. &#8220;The market had perhaps hoped
for a real blow-out quarter from Goldman Sachs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs fell 87 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $116.86 at
4:15 p.m. in New York trading. The stock has gained 29 percent
this year. It declined 46 percent in 2011, the second-worst
annual performance since Goldman Sachs went public in 1999, as
profit slid to the lowest level since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cost Cutting &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, 57, who began cutting costs in 2011 as revenue
declined for the second straight year, is banking on
international expansion and a market rebound to restore profit
growth. Gains in stock and corporate debt markets boosted total
trading revenue 87 percent from the fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re encouraged by the early signs of improvement&#8221; in
markets, although the firm remains &#8220;cautious,&#8221; Chief Financial
Officer David A. Viniar, 56, said during a conference call with
analysts and investors today. He added that the dividend
increase was made in response to &#8220;shareholder feedback.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income attributable to common shareholders, which
includes the cost of preferred dividends, climbed to $2.07
billion from $908 million, or $1.56 per fully diluted share, a
year earlier. Excluding a $1.64 billion one-time dividend paid
to Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A), last year&#8217;s first
quarter net income for common shareholders was $2.55 billion, or
$4.38 per share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Revenue Decline &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue at Goldman Sachs fell 16 percent to $9.95 billion
from $11.9 billion a year earlier, beating the $9.41 billion
average estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Book
value per share rose to $134.48 from $130.31 at the end of
December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our mix of businesses gives the firm significant room for
revenue growth as economic and market conditions continue to
improve,&#8221; Blankfein said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value-at-risk, a measure of how much the firm expects it
could lose in a single day of trading, dropped to an average of
$95 million in the first quarter from $135 million in the fourth
quarter. A 27 percent drop in value-at-risk on interest rates
compared with the prior quarter was driven by &#8220;lower levels of
volatility,&#8221; Viniar told analysts on the call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Return on Equity &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return on equity, a gauge of how well Goldman Sachs
reinvests shareholders&#8217; earnings, was 12.2 percent. That
compares with 14.5 percent in the first quarter of 2011,
excluding the dividend to Berkshire. The return on equity is
&#8220;not something we consider acceptable,&#8221; Viniar said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating expenses decreased to $6.77 billion from $7.85
billion a year earlier. Compensation, the biggest expense,
declined 16 percent to $4.38 billion. The firm employed 32,400
people at the end of March, down from 35,400 a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year&#8217;s plan to reduce expenses by $1.4 billion has
been &#8220;largely implemented,&#8221; and the company will continue to
seek ways to cut costs, Viniar said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Institutional securities, the sales and trading division
led since January by Isabelle Ealet, Pablo J. Salame, and Harvey M. Schwartz, generated $5.17 billion in revenue during the first
quarter, or 57 percent of the total. That&#8217;s down 14 percent from
$6.65 billion a year earlier and up from $3.06 billion in the
fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Accounting Adjustments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figures include a $225 million net loss from accounting
adjustments related to an improvement in the creditworthiness of
the firm&#8217;s own debt, Goldman Sachs said. Viniar said that loss
was split about evenly between fixed-income, currency and
commodities trading, or FICC, and equities trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FICC trading revenue of $3.46 billion compared with $4.33
billion a year earlier and $1.36 billion in the fourth quarter.
Interest-rate trading, which includes government bonds and
related derivatives, &#8220;had a very strong quarter and all the
other businesses had good, but not great, quarters,&#8221; Viniar
said. Interest-rate trading is run globally by London-based
Konstantinos N. &#8220;Kostas&#8221; Pantazopoulos, a 43-year-old Greek
citizen who has been a partner since 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viniar, asked why FICC trading fell short compared with
Citigroup and JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, said
the firm and its clients &#8220;have been cautious.&#8221; He also said
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s share of the fixed-income market has fallen
since 2009, when it generated record trading revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Market Share &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We still believe we&#8217;re getting a very high market
share,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re not getting the market share we were
getting in 2009, and remember I told you in 2009 we weren&#8217;t
going to keep that market share.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities revenue of $2.25 billion was down from $2.32
billion a year earlier and up from $1.69 billion in the prior
quarter. Paul M. Russo, Michael D. Daffey and R. Martin Chavez
were named last month as co-chief operating officers of the
equities division, reporting to Ealet, Salame and Schwartz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing and lending, the segment that includes money made
or lost on Goldman Sachs&#8217;s investments in companies, securities
and real estate, generated $1.91 billion of gains in the
quarter. That compares with $2.71 billion a year earlier and
$872 million in the fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within that segment was $169 million from the company&#8217;s
stake in Industrial  Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the
nation&#8217;s largest lender. That holding made $316 million a year
earlier and $388 million in the fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Investment Banking &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment-banking division, led since May by Richard J. Gnodde, David M. Solomon and John S. Weinberg, made $1.15
billion of revenue in the quarter, down from $1.27 billion a
year earlier and compared with $857 million in the fourth
quarter. That beat estimates from five analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg that ranged from $786 million to $993 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investment-banking revenues of $1.2 billion were much
better than our forecast,&#8221; analysts at Credit Suisse Group AG
led by Howard Chen wrote in a note to investors today. &#8220;The
current backdrop boasts many of the ingredients that could drive
a surge in activity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within that business, fees from takeovers and other
financial-advisory assignments rose 37 percent to $489 million
from $357 million a year earlier and compared with $470 million
in the fourth quarter. Last week the company said that Yoel Zaoui, who had been the London-based co-head of global mergers
and acquisitions with Gene T. Sykes for less than a year, is
leaving after a 24-year career at the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Equity Underwriting &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity underwriting revenue decreased 40 percent to $255
million from $426 million a year earlier and was up from $191
million in the fourth quarter. Debt underwriting fees fell 16
percent to $410 million from $486 million a year earlier and
were higher than the $196 million generated in the fourth
quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While debt financing markets are open and equity
financing markets are improving, MA activity has not yet gained
momentum,&#8221; Viniar told analysts today. He said the firm&#8217;s
backlog of investment-banking assignments remained unchanged in
the first quarter from the end of 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs ranks fourth among advisers on takeovers
announced globally this year after winning the top spot for
2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bank has
slipped to third place in equity, equity-linked and rights
offerings globally, after securing the No. 1 spot last year,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. In global corporate bond
underwriting, Goldman Sachs ranks seventh this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Investment Management &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from investment management, the division led since
the start of this year by Eric S. Lane and Timothy O&#8217;Neill,
dropped 8 percent to $1.18 billion from $1.27 billion a year
earlier and compared with $1.26 billion in the fourth quarter.
Assets under management fell to $824 billion from $828 billion
at the end of 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our performance in the last several months has definitely
improved and if that continues I think that would be a good
precursor to good inflows of assets,&#8221; Viniar said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have
to see if that continues.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein and President Gary D. Cohn, 51, were criticized
by former derivatives salesman Greg Smith in a New York Times
opinion piece last month for presiding over what Smith called a
decline in the firm&#8217;s commitment to client service. In a memo
sent to current and former employees, Blankfein and Cohn said
Smith&#8217;s view of the firm isn&#8217;t shared by most employees, adding
that they would investigate his claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Commitment to Clients &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Everyone at Goldman Sachs remains steadfast in their
commitment to serving our client franchise,&#8221; Viniar said today.
&#8220;We&#8217;re keenly aware that the quality of our advice and
execution in today&#8217;s challenging markets serves as the
foundation for maintaining these long-term client
relationships.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein and Cohn, approaching their sixth anniversary in
their current roles, are also contending with the departure of
more than 50 partners in the past year, including eight members
of the management committee. Viniar said the departures are
&#8220;natural&#8221; and &#8220;warranted&#8221; because the firm had lower-than-
normal departures in the years immediately after the financial
crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would expect that between now and the end of the year
you&#8217;ll see more partners leaving,&#8221; Viniar said. &#8220;It&#8217;s just the
natural progression and our bench is so deep that it&#8217;s really
not an issue at all.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world&#8217;s largest
soft-drink maker, reported first-quarter profit that topped
analysts&#8217; estimates, helped by pricing increases and demand in
North America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income rose 7.9 percent to $2.05 billion, or 89 cents a
share, from $1.9 billion, or 82 cents, a year earlier, Atlanta-
based Coca-Cola said today in a statement. Analysts projected 87
cents, the average of 14 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent has introduced smaller
package sizes to attract price-conscious consumers as part of an
effort to spur sales in North America, where the soft drink
industry is in a seven-year decline. Beverage sales volume for
the unit climbed 2 percent in the quarter, driven by demand for
Powerade energy drinks and Dasani water, contributing to a 5
percent gain globally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Coca-Cola&#8217;s volume growth was very strong this quarter
and despite commodity pressures and clear marketing
reinvestment, they delivered strong profitability,&#8221; Ali Dibadj,
a New York-based analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein  Co., said
today in an e-mail. Dibadj rates the shares outperform, the
equivalent of a buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola rose 2.1 percent to $73.95 at the close in New
York. The shares have gained 5.7 percent this year, while
PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) is little changed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Global Pricing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue advanced 5.9 percent to $11.1 billion, according to
the statement. The company raised global pricing 3 percent in
the quarter, outpacing last year&#8217;s 1.5 increase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The North America unit, Coca-Cola&#8217;s largest, accounted for
about 44 percent of global sales. The Pacific unit, the
company&#8217;s second-largest region, boosted volume sales 8 percent,
compared with 5 percent growth a year earlier. The division was
helped by a 3 percent jump in Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In emerging markets, India jumped 20 percent while Brazil
increased 4 percent, as both outpaced gains in the first quarter
a year earlier. China advanced 9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross margin narrowed to 61 percent from 62.5 percent a
year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Sarah Mulholland" date="Apr 17, 2012  4:05 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-17/jpmorgan-drops-florida-shopping-center-loan-from-mortgage-bond.html"><headline>JPMorgan Drops Florida Shopping-Center Loan From Mortgage Bond</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) removed a $49
million loan on a Florida shopping center from a $1.1 billion
commercial-mortgage bond it&#8217;s marketing, according to regulatory
filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debt is tied to the 182,705 square-foot property in
Boca Raton, Florida, according to a document filed with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission dated March 29. The mortgage
was the sixth-largest in the pool. The transaction is set to be
sold to investors this week, according to people familiar with
the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a spokesman for JPMorgan, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Erik Matuszewski" date="Apr 17, 2012 12:58 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-17/goldman-sets-bar-for-wall-street-decathlon-as-registration-opens.html"><headline>Goldman Sets Bar as Wall Street Decathlon Registration Opens</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) has set
the bar for challengers at this summer&#8217;s charity decathlon to
crown the best athlete on Wall Street. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs had the top two finishers and was the top
fundraising company in last year&#8217;s event, a 10-discipline
competition that raised about $500,000 for patient care and
research at New York&#8217;s Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Registration for the fourth annual decathlon opens today
and Brad Bagdis, a former Harvard University football captain at
Knight Capital Group Inc., is among those challenging the
Goldman Sachs team. Bagdis, 27, was third last year behind
Goldman&#8217;s Justin Nunez, a former defensive back at Columbia
University, and Kyle VanFleet, who played fullback at Georgetown
University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;d be lying if I told you we weren&#8217;t gunning for them a
little bit this year,&#8221; Bagdis, who&#8217;s in his fourth year as an
institutional sales trader at Knight Capital, said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s a bit of a rivalry. I played
football against Nunez when he was at Columbia.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nunez, in his third year working in the investment
management division at Goldman Sachs, won the decathlon title
last year after finishing third in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His victory came before family, friends and colleagues at
his alma mater, as the competition was held at Columbia&#8217;s Wien
Stadium on the northern tip of Manhattan. This year&#8217;s event,
which tests speed, strength and agility, will again be held at
Columbia on July 29. Registration information is available at
the event&#8217;s website, thedecathlon.org. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Defending Champion &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;After finishing third, my focus was on winning,&#8221; Nunez,
who finished with 7,095 points, 27 ahead of VanFleet, said by e-
mail. &#8220;Now that I&#8217;ve achieved that goal, I would like nothing
more than to hold on to the trophy for one more year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bagdis and Nunez, 28, are among a group of former Ivy
League football players who plan to take part this year. Former
University of Pennsylvania defensive end David Betten of George
Weiss Associates and former Columbia offensive lineman Ralph
DeBernardo of J.P. Morgan also have committed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awards are presented to the top three finishers as well as
the top executive performer, the winners in three age groups
(under 30, 30-39 and over 40), and the top fundraiser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom McGuirk, the managing director of HighTower Advisors in
Menlo Park, California, traveled to New York and took top honors
in the executive division last year. The 41-year-old McGuirk
competed in the 400-meter hurdles for Ireland in the 1996 and
2000 Olympics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Events &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the competition features runs at three distances --
40 yards, 400 meters and 800 meters -- that&#8217;s where its
similarities to the Olympic-style decathlon ends. Pull-ups, a
football throw, an agility drill, rowing, a vertical jump, bench
press and dips -- a triceps exercise using one&#8217;s own weight --
are also part of the one-day contest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field is limited to 150 competitors, each of whom must
raise $3,000 in contributions. Bloomberg LP, the parent company
of Bloomberg News, is among the event&#8217;s corporate sponsors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bagdis raised $10,710 last year. His roommate, colleague
and training partner Brian Ceglarski, 27, brought in almost
$13,000, helping Knight Capital rank third in team fund raising
in 2011 behind Goldman Sachs ($37,146) and Bank of America
Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch ($24,301). They have higher goals this
year, with at least two other co-workers joining the event and
strong support from management at the Jersey City, New Jersey-
based securities firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Strong Support &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve got a lot of help from the top guys who are
athletes themselves,&#8221; said the 6-foot-5 Ceglarski, who won the
rowing event in record time last year and plays hockey in a
league once a week at Chelsea Piers. &#8220;They&#8217;ve been supportive
financially and in getting the word out there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bagdis, who&#8217;s 6-foot-3 and 230 pounds -- down about 30
pounds from his playing weight as a defensive end and linebacker
at Harvard -- said he arrives at the office at 5 a.m. on
weekdays. He spends about an hour preparing for his work day and
then goes to the company gym downstairs for about an hour and 15
minutes before getting back to his desk for a daily team call at
7:30 a.m. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While he&#8217;s preparing for all 10 events, Bagdis said last
year&#8217;s experience made clear his weaknesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Being a bigger guy, I&#8217;m going to focus more on the
running,&#8221; Bagdis said. &#8220;It was absolutely brutal, the 400 and
800 meters. I&#8217;m just not built for long distance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doug Schlack, a 28-year-old junior bond broker in his fifth
year at BGC Partners Inc. (BGCP), finished fifth in his debut at the
decathlon in 2011 and said this year he wants to match the
victory by his younger brother, Chris, at the event in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doug Schlack said he isn&#8217;t focused on the team from Goldman
Sachs, even though he knows he&#8217;ll have to get past the defending
champion to bring his family a second title. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t say I necessarily aim for those guys,&#8221;
Schlack said. &#8220;I just know if I stay consistent -- now that I
know what to expect -- I should be able to compete again. And as
much as you want to win this event, you can&#8217;t forget the cause
we&#8217;re all there for, raising money for cancer awareness and
having fun being able to compete.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Cecile Gutscher" date="Apr 17, 2012 11:19 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-17/treasuries-investors-reduce-bets-on-drop-jpmorgan-says.html"><headline>Treasuries Investors Reduce Bets on Drop, JPMorgan Says</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. said investors
raised expectations for price gains in U.S. Treasuries by the
most on record in a weekly sentiment survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long positions increased by 10 percentage points to 25
percent, the largest weekly increase in so-called outright longs
since the survey started in October 2010, JPMorgan said in a
report today. Neutral positions decreased by 15 percentage
points to 57 percent, the largest weekly decline since March 7,
2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short positions increased by 6 percent to 19 percent. A
short position is a wager the price of a security will fall,
while a long position is a bet it will rise. JPMorgan doesn&#8217;t
disclose the number of clients in the survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Michael J. Moore and Christine Harper" date="Apr 17, 2012  8:13 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-17/goldman-sachs-says-average-pay-slides-16-to-135-123.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Says Average Pay Slides 16% to $135,123</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, set aside $4.4 billion to pay
employees in the first quarter, 16 percent less than a year
earlier, as revenue fell and the company cut jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount, which covers salaries, benefits and accruals
for year-end bonuses, is enough to give each of the firm&#8217;s
32,400 employees $135,123. A year earlier, the New York-based
firm&#8217;s $5.23 billion first-quarter compensation expense equaled
$147,825 for each of the 35,400 employees at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street firms including Goldman Sachs, led by Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, are reducing jobs and
compensation to preserve profit. Europe&#8217;s debt crisis and new
regulations have weighed on trading revenue, while slow economic
growth limited fees for takeovers and financing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The dynamic for the trading companies has changed -- I
just don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re going to be able to make the kind of
money they used to make,&#8221; Mark Bronzo, a portfolio manager who
helps oversee $125 billion for Guggenheim Investments in
Irvington, New York, said before the figures were released. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sum set aside by Goldman Sachs equals 44 percent of
revenue, about the same as in the first quarter of 2011.
Blankfein, 57, received a 35 percent cut in his own compensation
for last year to $12.4 million after earnings dropped 47 percent
and the stock tumbled 46 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toshiba Tec Corp. (6588), the Japanese
maker of scanners and bar-code machines, will acquire
International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)&#8217;s point-of-sale terminal
business for about $850 million in its biggest acquisition ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toshiba Tec, 50 percent owned by TV and computer maker
Toshiba Corp. (6502), will acquire the Retail Store Solutions business,
the companies said in a joint statement today. The deal is
expected to close late in the second quarter or early in the
third quarter, subject to regulatory approvals, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction gives Toshiba a business that had revenue
of about $1.15 billion last year and about 1,000 employees
globally. Retailers use the point-of-sale systems, which include
both hardware and software, to process and record transactions,
manage inventory and collect and analyze data including
customers&#8217; purchasing trends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The purchase would strengthen Toshiba Tec&#8217;s core
business,&#8221; said Mitsushige Akino, who oversees about $600
million at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co. in Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toshiba Tec will use its own money to fund the purchase,
spokesman Takashi Mizuno said by phone. The company had 82.05
billion yen ($1 billion) yen in cash and near cash as of Dec.
31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Strong Presence&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toshiba Tec rose 6.9 percent, the most in a month, to close
at 327 yen in Tokyo trading after the Nikkei newspaper reported
the deal earlier today. Toshiba was unchanged at 333 yen. IBM
was little changed at $202.72 in New York trading yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Toshiba Tec enjoys a strong presence in retail store
solutions in Asia-Pacific, including Japan, and we are confident
that this acquisition will support expansion in North America,
Europe and the emerging economies,&#8221; Norio Sasaki, president at
Toshiba, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armonk, New York-based IBM, the world&#8217;s largest computer-
services provider, is increasing its focus on software, cloud
computing and emerging markets as part of a five-year plan that
includes adding $20 billion in new revenue by 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It will have a major impact for Toshiba Tec,&#8221; said
Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Securities Co. in Tokyo.
&#8220;Toshiba Tec will be able to expand its POS business with the
acquisition, as IBM already has customers and can lure new ones
with its brand.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toshiba Tec&#8217;s previous biggest takeover was a $315 million
takeover of TEC Electronics in 1993, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s deal comes as Toshiba and other Japanese consumer-
electronics makers cope with slumping demand and a stronger yen.
Toshiba in January cut its profit forecast by 54 percent for the
year ended March 31. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) sold about $1
billion of commercial-mortgage bonds after widening the relative
yields on some classes, according to people familiar with the
transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A top-ranked slice maturing in 9.91 years, initially
marketed to yield 110 basis points more than the benchmark swap
rate, paid 115 basis over the benchmark, said the people, who
declined to be identified because the terms aren&#8217;t public. The
spread on debt rated A3 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service yields 425
basis points, after being marketed to pay 400 basis points, the
people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Landlords are borrowing more against their properties in
commercial-mortgage bond deals planned through June, according
to Moody&#8217;s. Transactions slated to be marketed during the second
quarter include pools with average loan sizes approaching or
exceeding the value of the buildings as calculated by Moody&#8217;s,
the New York-based ratings company said in a report this week.
Banks may have to boost investor protections if underwriting
standards keep sliding, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commercial-mortgage bond sales have been reviving, with
banks arranging about $28 billion of the securities last year,
up from $11.5 billion in 2010, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. About $5 billion has been sold this year, compared
with a record $232.5 billion in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relative yields on commercial-mortgage bonds surged earlier
this month when the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said it was
considering selling portions of its portfolio assumed in the
2008 rescue of American International Group Inc., fueling
concerns that a flood of bonds would depress values. The spread
has since narrowed to 186 basis points, or 1.86 percentage
points, more than Treasuries after reaching a six-week high of
206 basis points on April 10, according to a Barclays index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed invited eight dealers to bid on the $7.5 billion
portion of the portfolio linked to commercial real estate CDOs,
the district bank said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB (GFNORTEO),
Mexico&#8217;s third-biggest lender by loans, fell the most in six
months after JPMorgan Chase  Co. cut its recommendation to the
equivalent of hold from buy, citing the stock&#8217;s valuation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Banorte fell 4 percent to 60.73 pesos at the
close of trading, the biggest slide since Oct. 17. The benchmark
IPC index declined 0.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banorte&#8217;s 44 percent rally this year makes it the top
performer on the country&#8217;s benchmark equity gauge, which has
climbed 6.1 percent. The shares closed April 16 at 17 times
trailing 12-months earnings, the highest in a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We no longer find the valuation sufficiently compelling
to recommend the shares,&#8221; JPMorgan analysts led by Saul Martinez wrote in the report. &#8220;We continue to believe Banorte
is well positioned to generate healthy bottom-line growth and
profitability&#8221; in the coming years, Martinez said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intel Corp. (INTC) and International
Business Machines Corp. (IBM), computer-industry bellwethers, posted
the slowest sales growth in more than two years last quarter as
the European slump weighed on orders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s revenue climbed 0.3 percent to $24.7 billion in the
period, while Intel sales rose 0.5 percent to $12.9 billion.
That was the smallest increase for either company since the
third quarter of 2009, when the U.S. economy was just emerging
from recession. Even so, Intel predicted a pickup in sales for
the current quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two technology giants are seeking growth in emerging
markets while coping with a slowdown triggered by the European
debt crisis. The personal-computer market, which contracted in
the U.S. last year for the first time since 2001, also is
hurting demand for Intel&#8217;s processors. IBM, meanwhile, is more
focused on expanding earnings per share, rather than pursuing
less-profitable orders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All else being equal, you&#8217;d rather see top-line growth,&#8221;
said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co.
in New York. Still, he said, most investors are looking more
closely at profit than sales. &#8220;IBM has conditioned investors to
focus on EPS growth. That&#8217;s how it provides guidance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pipeline companies offer the best
returns in energy for investors seeking to cash in on the U.S.
shale boom while avoiding the volatility of a commodity market
that&#8217;s seen natural-gas prices reach a 10-year-low and crude
bounce above $100 a barrel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BLOOMBERG RISKLESS RETURN RANKING shows pipeline
companies in the past five years have provided triple the risk-
adjusted return of companies that produce and refine oil and
gas, such as Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the next best group. Enbridge
Inc. (ENB) of Canada leads companies on the Bloomberg World Pipelines
Index, which returned 2.9 percent when adjusted for price
swings. Producers focused on finding and extracting oil and gas
gained 0.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pipelines are the toll roads of the energy industry,
inoculated against price swings thanks to long-term contracts
that lock in fees based on the volume of products they ship.
Demand for shipping is expected to grow as oil and gas drilling
accelerates in U.S. shale fields. With energy&#8217;s best returns and
lowest risk, pipelines have attracted investors such as Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which owns 19.1 percent of Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMI),
the parent of the second-biggest U.S. pipeline company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These are companies that have multiyear contracts
involving products that are essential to the functioning of
society,&#8221; said Randle Smith, a portfolio manager with Duff 
Phelps Investment Management Co. who helps manage $4.9 billion
of global utilities and infrastructure investments, including
more than 2 million Enbridge shares. &#8220;They&#8217;re not taking on
commodity price risks, so it&#8217;s a very secure business model.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enbridge&#8217;s Lowest Risk &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk-adjusted return, which isn&#8217;t annualized, is
calculated by dividing total return by volatility, or the degree
of daily price-swing variation, giving a measure of income per
unit of risk. A higher volatility means the price of an asset
can swing dramatically in a short period of time, increasing the
potential for unexpected losses compared with a security whose
price moves at a steady rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enbridge provided a 6.8 percent risk-adjusted return in the
past five years, the highest among the 89 companies on the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s Global 1200 Energy Index (SGES), as well as among the
20 biggest pipeline companies in the world as measured by market
value. The return was more than triple the 2.1 percent average
on the Cushing 30 MLP index, which includes many competitors
that operate as partnerships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Better Than Exxon &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Calgary-based operator&#8217;s risk-adjusted return was
almost 10 times that of Exxon, which has the top credit rating
from three rating companies and is a mainstay of energy
portfolios around the world due to its stable returns and
dividends. Enbridge had higher returns than 94 percent of energy
stocks on the SP Global index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Pat Daniel sees no reason for the
company to take on riskier investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s Enbridge,&#8221; he said in an interview. &#8220;We&#8217;re not a
&#8216;Hail Mary&#8217; kind of company. We&#8217;re a grind it out, win it every
day, consistent performer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enbridge returned 150 percent to shareholders in the past
five years through price appreciation and dividends, the highest
among pipeline companies. Enbridge has earned $5.53 billion for
shareholders since 2007, slightly higher than the $5.45 billion
of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP (KMP), which had the second-
highest risk-adjusted return of pipeline operators after
Enbridge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enbridge fell 0.3 percent to C$38.83 at the close in
Toronto. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stability Hallmark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enbridge had the second-lowest volatility of the pipeline
companies after TransCanada Corp. (TRP), another Calgary-based company
that is seeking to build a pipeline from Canada&#8217;s oil sands to
the Texas coast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stability has been a hallmark of pipeline companies, whose
shipping agreements with refiners and oil and gas producers
often last for decades and include regular price increases.
Though rising prices can chip away at demand, during the
recession of 2007 to 2009, gasoline demand dropped just 3
percent, said Chris Eades, who helps manage more than $2 billion
in a pair of pipeline-oriented funds at Legg Mason (LM)&#8217;s ClearBridge
Advisors in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A 3 percent swing in volumes is not going to make or
break one of these pipeline companies&#8217; ability to pay their
distribution,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Soaring Demand for Pipes &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need for pipelines soared in the past five years as
improved technology allowed companies to expand production in
U.S. shale-rock formations and Canada&#8217;s oil sands. North
American output may grow 70 percent by 2020, possibly surpassing
that of the Middle East, according to Citigroup Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil production in North Dakota reached 535,000 barrels a
day in January and could grow to 1 million by 2020, said Dan Spears, a fund manager at Swank Capital LLC. Production in the
Eagle Ford Shale, almost non-existent in 2007, may grow to
850,000 barrels a day by the middle of this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All these guys have got to build more storage and more
pipelines to get their oil to market,&#8221; Spears said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pipelines have cost advantages over other sectors of the
industry. Drilling for oil and gas has become more expensive as
exploration moves farther offshore or into more drilling-
intensive formations like shale, said Bob Brackett, an analyst
with Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in New York. The cost of finding
and developing a barrel of oil has risen 14 percent annually for
the past 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tougher Rocks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the inflation is cyclical, based on the price of
labor; the rest is a result of &#8220;the rocks getting tougher&#8221; and
requiring more expensive production techniques, Brackett said in
an interview. Reducing those costs &#8220;would take a technical
breakthrough that we haven&#8217;t seen yet.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the cost of drilling was rising, market volatility
pushed oil to $145.29 a barrel in 2008, then down to $33.87 the
same year before rising again to about $102 this month. Natural
gas reached $13.577 per million British thermal units in 2008
then fell this month to less than $1.975, the lowest since 2002. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those price swings have cut into profits for both explorers
and refiners such as Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC) and Valero Energy
Corp. (VLO) Rising prices for Brent crude, the international
benchmark, has increased costs and hurt profitability for U.S.
refiners on the East Coast, which rely on imports to process
fuel, said Zach Parham, an analyst with Bloomberg Industries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;International Oil Spikes &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent spiked to a high of $126.65 in 2011 as political
turmoil spread in the Middle East. It rose again to a high of
$126.22 this year, driven by demand from China and Iran&#8217;s threat
to close the Strait of Hormuz, the sea lane that carries a fifth
of the world&#8217;s oil, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil service and equipment companies also have seen more
volatility as fluctuating prices drove demand for drilling. The
15-company Philadelphia Oil Service Sector Index (OSX) returned 0.1
percent, after adjusting for volatility, during a five-year
period that saw offshore demand evaporate in the Gulf of Mexico
following the 2010 BP Plc oil spill and onshore demand explode
from new shale fields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the pipeline networks operated by Enbridge and its
rivals were already in place when the North American drilling
boom began. The U.S. already had 278,000 miles (447,000
kilometers) of gas transmission lines and 160,000 miles of oil
and products lines, according to the U.S. Transportation
Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Well-Placed Networks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of Enbridge&#8217;s existing pipelines were already in or
near the new sources of oil and gas, ClearBridge&#8217;s Eades said.
Its Canadian mainline system was built in the 1950s, for
instance, and was well-positioned when Canada&#8217;s tar sands region
began producing oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s not all clear sailing for pipelines. Many new projects
are facing increasing environmental scrutiny and greater
oversight by regulators concerned about leaks and safety.
Environmental groups were able to block TransCanada&#8217;s proposed
Keystone XL line from Canada to Texas, at least temporarily,
because of concerns it might pollute water in Nebraska. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, new gas fields such as the Marcellus
Shale in Pennsylvania have been developed closer to major East
Coast cities, reducing the need for long-haul pipelines to those
areas, said Greg Reid, managing director of Salient Partners LP,
which has about $600 million invested in energy infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies are finding ways to adapt, often by expanding or
repurposing existing pipelines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reconfiguring Existing Pipes &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kinder Morgan plans to boost its oil shipments in Canada by
expanding its decades-old Trans Mountain pipeline, which runs
from Alberta to Vancouver. Kinder also is considering a
conversion of its Pony Express gas line to carry oil from
expanding production in North Dakota&#8217;s Bakken shale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spectra Energy Corp. (SE), whose Texas Eastern system has
shipped gas northward since the 1940s, said April 12 it may
reverse part of the system to carry gas from the Marcellus to
new power plants in the U.S. Southeast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Keystone project was blocked, Enterprise Products
Partners LP (EPD) has worked with Enbridge to reverse the Seaway
pipeline between Cushing, Oklahoma, and Houston. Coupled with
other expansions, the project will enable Enbridge to ship an
additional 500,000 barrels a day of crude from Canada to Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel, the Enbridge CEO, sees no reason to change the
business model any time soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our society is kind of aimed at rewarding risk-takers,
but if you can get to the end result without taking risk, why do
it?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Why risk your investors&#8217; money if you can get
there with a low-risk investment?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said
investors should buy Apple Inc. (AAPL) shares, which fell as much as
8.8 percent in the past week, amid a &#8220;very big year&#8221; for the
world&#8217;s biggest company by market value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple will report fiscal second-quarter earnings of $10.18
a share on April 24, Goldman Sachs said in a note to investors
today. That&#8217;s higher than a previous estimate of $9.36 and the
average analyst projection in a Bloomberg survey of $9.84.
Goldman Sachs also lifted its 2012 projection to $45.76, more
than the average projection of $44.21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect the company to report another solid quarter,
with particular strength in iPhone and iPad sales, and we&#8217;re
raising estimates as a result,&#8221; Bill Shope, an analyst at
Goldman Sachs in New York, wrote in a note today. &#8220;We continue
to believe Apple&#8217;s shares are very attractive at current levels,
and we&#8217;d be buyers ahead of March-quarter results.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs boosted its 12-month share-price forecast for
Cupertino, California-based Apple to $750 from $700. Shope has
had a buy rating on the stock since at least December 2010,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple declined 0.2 percent to $608.34 today. The shares
climbed 5.1 percent yesterday, snapping a five-day decline, amid
optimism that the iPhone and iPad will top sales projections
when the company delivers quarterly results next week. Apple
added 51 percent this year through yesterday, about five times
the increase of the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the largest technology companies tumbled today after
reporting results. Intel Corp. (INTC) and International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM) posted the slowest sales growth in years as the
European slump weighed on orders last quarter. Intel&#8217;s shares
dropped 1.8 percent, while IBM fell 3.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects name of investor in final paragraph.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotify Ltd. will incorporate its
music streaming service with Coca-Cola Co. (KO)&#8217;s Internet marketing,
to help raise awareness and draw users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The music-streaming service will be &#8220;the key underlying
technology for Coca-Cola Music globally&#8221; and the soft-drink
maker will &#8220;integrate Spotify into its Facebook presence,&#8221;
Atlanta-based Coca-Cola said today in a joint statement with
London-based Spotify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotify&#8217;s top priority is to attract more paying
subscribers and users to its advertising-supported service,
Daniel Ek, founder and chief executive officer, said in an April
13 interview in the Swedish newspaper Dagens Industri. The
company created a &#8220;play&#8221; button last week that allows legal
streams of songs and albums to be embedded on websites. EK also
added an artist radio feature that plays music by a particular
band and similar acts, to compete with Pandora Media Inc. (P) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal with Coca-Cola will &#8220;will help bring Spotify to
more parts of the world,&#8221; Ek told reporters in New York today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Paying Listeners &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotify added 500,000 subscribers two months after the
service became available on Facebook Inc. (FB)&#8217;s social network, the
company said in November, bringing the number of paying
listeners to 2.5 million. Listeners pay $4.99 for the service on
personal computers or $9.99 for PCs and mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The service is also trying to win over artists. Adele, the
Black Keys, Coldplay and Tom Waits have withheld new releases
from Spotify, which began U.S. service in July. Last week, the
company announced exclusive access to songs and albums by the
Red Hot Chili Peppers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is also facing competition from other
subscription music services including Rdio Inc., as well as
online ventures by Viacom Inc. (VIAB)&#8217;s MTV, AOL Inc. and Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotify lost about $59 million on revenue of $250 million
last year, Ek said in the Dagens Industri interview. The service
paid about $150 million to rights holders in 2011, compared with
$55 million in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company raised $100 million last year from venture
capital investors including DST Global, Accel Partners and
Kleiner Perkins Caufield  Byers, achieving a valuation of about
$1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lira may strengthen while
government debt maturing in one year or less might decline after
Turkey&#8217;s central bank said it could tighten monetary policy to
pare inflation, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s announcement by the central bank that it may lend
toward the upper end of its rates corridor of 5.75 percent to
11.5 percent more often is &#8220;clearly positive for the currency
but could hurt short-term Treasury bills,&#8221; Yarkin Cebeci,
economist for the region at JPMorgan in Istanbul, said in an e-

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We would expect the effective funding rate to remain
above the 8 percent mark even on normal days while the central
bank is expected to get even more sensitive to the currency
movements and is likely to start additional monetary tightening
whenever the lira starts under-performing,&#8221; Cebeci said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s
largest software maker, reported fiscal third-quarter profit
that topped estimates on better-than-expected sales of software
for businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income slipped to $5.11 billion, or 60 cents a share,
from $5.23 billion, or 61 cents, a year earlier, Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft said today in a statement. Analysts
had predicted an average 57 cents in profit, according to
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose to 6 percent to
$17.4 billion, beating the $17.2 billion average projection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft benefited from robust corporate purchasing of
Office productivity programs, Windows 7 operating systems and
software for servers. The company plans later this year to
release Windows 8, the newest version of its operating system,
to help it win back consumers and narrow Apple Inc.&#8217;s lead in
the market for tablets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These are the kind of quarters that are tough to pull
out, and the corporate demand is pulling them through,&#8221; said
Pat Becker Jr., a fund manager at Becker Capital Management in
Portland, Oregon, who owns Microsoft shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares climbed as much as 3.2 percent to $32 in
extended trading after the report. The stock had decreased less
than 1 percent to $31.01 at the close in New York. It gained 24
percent in the three months through the end of March, the
biggest quarterly increase since mid-2009, as investors grow
more confident about the prospects for Windows 8. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc. (FB), the biggest social-
networking service, made an offer for AOL Inc. (AOL)&#8217;s patent
portfolio before losing out to Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s $1.06 billion
bid, two people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal by Facebook was too low, said the people, who
asked not to be identified because the discussions haven&#8217;t been
disclosed. Still, Microsoft intends to sell most of the newly
acquired portfolio because it doesn&#8217;t consider all of the 800
patents and related applications essential to its intellectual
property arsenal, according to another person with knowledge of
the matter. Facebook may be interested in those patents
Microsoft plans to sell, one person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology industry has been bulking up on patents amid
a surge in disputes over ownership of rights to key
breakthroughs in areas such as mobile communications.
Microsoft&#8217;s ability to find a buyer will hinge on the quality of
the patents, said David Berten, founder and partner of Global IP
Law Group, a Chicago-based law firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Often in large portfolios the value is concentrated in a
smaller subset of patents, so it can be that in a 800-patent
portfolio only 20 contain most of the value,&#8221; Berten said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry Yu, a spokesman for Facebook, declined to comment, as
did Kevin Kutz, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft, and Caroline Campbell, a spokeswoman for New York-
based AOL. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sandberg-Led Discussions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the same day Microsoft unveiled the AOL deal, Facebook,
based in Menlo Park, California, said it is buying the Instagram
photo-sharing tool for $1 billion. Facebook Chief Operating
Officer Sheryl Sandberg led the negotiations to acquire AOL&#8217;s
patents, one person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook has lined up $8 billion of available credit from
its IPO underwriters. Like more established technology
companies, such as Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc., it is buying
intellectual property to protect itself from patent-infringement
litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook, which is in the midst of a patent dispute with
Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO), acquired 750 patents from International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM), a person with knowledge of the matter said on
March 22. Yahoo sued Facebook on March 12, alleging that the
social network infringed patents covering such functions as
Internet advertising and information sharing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If an unfavorable outcome were to occur in this
litigation, the impact could be material to our business,
financial condition or results of operations,&#8221; Facebook said in
a March 27 filing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) is near a
decision to pick a financial adviser, and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
is the leading candidate to help the company weigh strategy
options, two people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final choice hasn&#8217;t been made and could come within days,
said one of the people, who declined to be identified because
the matter is private. RIM is considering options such as a
licensing deal or a strategic investment, a person with
knowledge of the matter said this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Thorsten Heins, who took over from
company co-founders Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie in January,
said he&#8217;s considering strategy changes after customer and
market-share losses led to five straight quarters of sales
shortfalls for Waterloo, Ontario-based RIM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This clearly indicates that opinion in Waterloo is
changing much faster than people anticipated,&#8221; said Anil Doradla, an analyst at William Blair  Co. in Chicago. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
far cry from what they stated six months ago.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heins has taken a far more candid approach to recognizing
RIM&#8217;s shortcomings and communicating them within and outside the
company than his predecessors, said Doradla, who rates its
shares the equivalent of hold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Recognizing the Realities&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He&#8217;s recognizing the realities and saying, &#8216;You know
what, let&#8217;s be realistic&#8217; -- and credit to him,&#8221; Doradla said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIM also discussed its options with Bank of America Corp.,
according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tenille Kennedy, a RIM spokeswoman, declined to comment,
citing a policy not to discuss rumor or speculation. Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan, also
declined to comment, as did John Yiannacopoulos, a Bank of
America spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIM climbed 2 percent to $13.47 at the close in New York.
The stock has dropped 75 percent in the past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company would prefer to license its BlackBerry mobile
operating system, a person with knowledge of the matter said
this week. RIM is racing to put the final touches on a new
platform, known as BB10, and release the first smartphone built
on the software later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a licensing deal, RIM&#8217;s next choice would be to find
a strategic investor, the person said this week. RIM doesn&#8217;t
plan to sell itself, according to the person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hiring Intent &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doradla, the William Blair analyst, said RIM doesn&#8217;t need a
banker to negotiate a licensing relationship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The way I interpret hiring a banker is to sell parts of
business, an outright sale or an equity stake by a third
party,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heins, who joined RIM in 2007, said in March that while the
company would consider a sale, that wasn&#8217;t &#8220;the main
direction&#8221; he&#8217;s pursuing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sameet Kanade, an analyst at Northern Securities in
Toronto, said that means RIM is considering even narrower
options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have never seen a banker be hired for licensing
negotiations,&#8221; said Kanade, who has a sell rating on RIM.
&#8220;There is only one reason you hire a banker and that&#8217;s to put
it up for sale or sell parts of the company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UBS AG (UBSN)&#8217;s equities division for the
Americas added Scott Molin, who previously worked at Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS), as a managing director in its senior
relationship-management team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molin will focus on hedge funds, according to an internal
employee memo obtained by Bloomberg News. At Goldman Sachs, he
was co-head of the firm&#8217;s cross assets sales group to hedge
funds, and before that worked in equity research sales at
Donaldson, Lufkin  Jenrette, UBS said in the memo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christiaan Brakman, a spokesman for the Zurich-based bank,
declined to comment beyond confirming the memo&#8217;s contents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is in
talks with a Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) unit to sell its Petershill
fund that buys stakes in hedge funds, according to two people
familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The negotiations with New York-based Asset Management
Finance LLC haven&#8217;t yet led to an agreement and the talks may
still fall apart, said the people who asked not to be identified
because the information is private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Finn, chief executive officer of Asset Management
Finance, didn&#8217;t immediately return calls seeking comment on the
talks, which were reported by the New York Times yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petershill was started in 2007 and bought stakes of between
8 percent and 9 percent in hedge funds, including Winton Capital
Management Ltd. and Capula Investment Management LLP in London.
The Goldman fund, which was previously run by Jonathan Sorrell,
also invested in Level Global Investors LP, which liquidated
after being raided by the FBI in 2010, and Shumway Capital
Partners LLC, which closed last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UBS AG (UBS), Switzerland&#8217;s largest bank,
hired former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) trader Timothy Milton for
its distressed credit business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milton started at UBS in New York last week, according to
three people familiar with the hire, who declined to be
identified because the appointment hasn&#8217;t been announced
publicly. He reports to Jeff Teach, global head of distressed
debt, special situations and loan trading, the people said.
Christiaan Brakman, a UBS spokesman, confirmed the hire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS hired Mike Weir as a loan trader last year. He
previously ran the loan trading desk at Citadel Securities, a
unit of Ken Griffin&#8217;s Citadel LLC. UBS moved its credit sales
and trading team to New York from Stamford, Connecticut in
December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been $175.1 billion of leveraged loans, those
rated below BBB- by Standard  Poor&#8217;s (MHP) and less than Baa3 at
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service (MCO), arranged in the U.S. this year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. UBS has arranged $4
billion, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loan prices have risen 2.7 cents on the dollar this year,
as measured by the SP/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 Index. They
reached a high in the first quarter of 93.84 cents March 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs recently named Bryan Mix global head of loan
trading, and Jonathan Meltzer and John Shaffer, co-heads of New
York credit sales. The changes came after the bank began
restricting people working in the loan sales and trading
business from receiving private information, such as corporate
financial projections. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James A. Johnson, the longest-
serving member of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s board, is being
opposed for re-election by a fund management company that boasts
long-time links with billionaire Warren Buffett. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruane, Cunniff  Goldfarb Inc., the New York firm that
helps oversee $15 billion, including the $5.7 billion Sequoia
Fund Inc. (SEQUX), criticized Johnson&#8217;s role in &#8220;egregious corporate
governance debacles&#8221; in a letter on its website yesterday and
said it would also oppose Johnson if he stands for re-election
to the board of Target Inc. (TGT) The Financial Times reported on the
letter&#8217;s contents earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe that Mr. Johnson&#8217;s history should disqualify
him for service on the board of any public company,&#8221; Chief
Executive Officer Robert D. Goldfarb and President David M. Poppe, co-managers of the Sequoia Fund, wrote in the letter to
clients. &#8220;We respectfully ask that you vote your Goldman Sachs
proxy against him.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson, 68, has been chairman of the compensation
committee at Goldman Sachs since it became a public company in
1999. Ruane, Cunniff has managed 1.4 million Goldman Sachs
shares since April 2010, including 435,000 held in the Sequoia
Fund. The board of Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by
assets, has recommended that shareholders re-elect Johnson,
David Wells, a company spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He has served them well since 1999 and will continue to
do so,&#8221; Wells said. Johnson didn&#8217;t immediately reply to a phone
message left at his office in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Graham Acolytes &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public rebuke by an investor comes in the same week
that a majority of shareholders of Citigroup Inc. (C), the third-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, voted against a compensation plan
for executives including CEO Vikram Pandit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sequoia Fund was co-founded in 1970 by Richard Cunniff and
William Ruane, a friend of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) CEO Buffett
since both studied under value investor Benjamin Graham at
Columbia University. When Buffett shut down his investment
partnership in 1969 to concentrate on Berkshire Hathaway, he
recommended that his clients invest with Ruane. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett, who disclosed earlier this week that he is being
treated for prostate cancer, last year redeemed his $5 billion
preferred-stock investment in Goldman Sachs that was made at the
depths of the financial crisis. He continues to hold warrants on
the stock and has been a supporter of Goldman Sachs Chairman and
CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein, 57. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beats Peers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sequoia Fund, which reopened to new investors in 2008 after
having been closed to outside money for 26 years, disclosed in a
regulatory filing in January that it was limiting new investment
through financial advisers and intermediaries. It said it would
continue to sell shares directly to investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sequoia generated a 13.2 percent return last year,
outperforming 99 percent of its peers as well as the 2.1 percent
gain that the SP 500 index recorded when dividends are
included, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The fund had
a total return of 19.5 percent in 2010, a performance that led
Chicago-based Morningstar Inc. to designate Goldfarb and Poppe
as its domestic stock fund managers of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruane, Cunniff voted against Johnson&#8217;s re-election to the
Goldman Sachs board and the Target board last year, according to
a person with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be
identified because the fund doesn&#8217;t disclose how it votes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1991 until 1998, Johnson was chairman and CEO of
mortgage-finance company Fannie Mae, which was taken under
government protection in 2008. His tenure at Fannie Mae was a
central theme of the book &#8220;Reckless Endangerment: How Outsized
Ambition, Greed and Corruption Led to Economic Armageddon&#8221; by
Gretchen Morgenson and Joshua Rosner that was published last
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Restated Earnings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their April 18 letter to investors, Goldfarb and Poppe
wrote that Fannie Mae used its status as a government-sponsored
entity to borrow money cheaply and &#8220;dramatically expanded its
portfolio of retained mortgages&#8221; during the 1990s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Rather than act conservatively to protect taxpayers,
during Johnson&#8217;s tenure Fannie ramped up its growth by buying
lower-quality mortgages,&#8221; according to the letter. &#8220;This
bloated Fannie&#8217;s balance sheet, increased its profit and
magnified the risk to taxpayers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter also cites Johnson&#8217;s tenures on the boards of
Minnetonka, Minnesota-based UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH), the biggest
U.S. health insurer, and Los Angeles-based homebuilder KB Home (KBH),
which both had to restate earnings after backdating option
grants to their CEOs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldfarb and Poppe also cite media reports from 2008 that
said Johnson may have received below-market rates on home loans
from Countrywide Financial, which sold loans to Fannie Mae. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a June 7, 2008, report in the Wall Street Journal,
Johnson quit then-Senator Barack Obama&#8217;s vice-presidential
search committee to avoid distracting attention from Obama&#8217;s
candidacy and said that &#8220;blatantly false statements and
misrepresentations&#8221; were written about him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby Joseph Cohen, senior U.S.
investment strategist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said equities
will give better returns than bonds in the mid-to-long term as
companies look to emerging markets for growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You need to go back to the late 1950s to see a situation
which equities were priced as attractively as they are now
relative to bonds,&#8221; she said in a Bloomberg Radio interview
today with Tom Keene. &#8220;1958-1959 was a period in which
investors were very concerned about the economy and the yields
on many equities exceeded the yields on fixed income at that
point and -- as you know -- we moved into a multidecade bull
market in equities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index (SPX) surged 26 percent through
yesterday from its 2011 low on Oct. 3 as economic data beat
economists&#8217; forecasts and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke said he will keep interest rates low through at least
late 2014 to spur growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With yields at very low levels, bonds may not be all that
safe,&#8221; she said. &#8220;When yields do start to rise, as they may at
some point in the future, prices go down.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Foundation
last night announced a $2.5 million gift to Turnaround for
Children, a New York-based nonprofit that works to transform
low-performing schools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grant over a three-year period will help pay for full-
time social workers and teacher-training dealing with the
disruptiveness of poverty. The cost of the Turnaround model at
each school is $250,000 a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Turnaround is committed to closing the gap, and so are
we,&#8221; Kim Jasmin of the foundation said in the ballroom of the
Plaza Hotel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More gifts followed on the occasion of Turnaround&#8217;s annual
benefit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan&#8217;s chairman and chief executive,
pledged $25,000. D.E. Shaw Managing Director Trey Beck,
Turnaround&#8217;s chairman gave $32,000. Both men were absent;
Turnaround vice chairman Simone Levinson read their messages
aloud, from her Blackberry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recording artist John Legend, industrialist David Koch and
Blackstone Group Vice Chairman Byron Wien also sent promises of
pledges in e-mails. (Wien is the godfather of the eldest child 
of the founding chairwoman of Turnaround, Dr. Kelly Posner 
Gerstenhaber; her husband, David Gerstenhaber, is president of
Argonaut Capital Management.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goldie Hawn &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Gallogly, co-founder of Centerbridge Partners, was
among the guests at the event who made a donation. He and
Jeffrey C. Walker, former chairman of CCMP Capital, sat with
Goldie Hawn as she ate a whole-wheat roll and filet mignon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Hawn took the stage as honoree -- introduced by a
fifth grader named Erick DeLaCruz, who aspires to be a New York
Yankee -- she spoke about MindUp, the program she started to
teach social and emotional skills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We want to nurture confidence, optimism and empathy,&#8221;
the actress said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honoree Russ Carson said he became a Turnaround donor after
meeting its founder, Dr. Pamela Cantor, at a dinner party. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I made the mistake of asking her what she does,&#8221; Carson
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other guests who have made the same mistake: Larry Rogers,
David Tepper&#8217;s deputy at Appaloosa Management; David Wasserman,
a Clayton Dubilier  Rice LLC partner; and Atlantic Media Co.
chairman David Bradley and his wife, Katherine Bradley, whose
CityBridge Foundation is funding the Turnaround model in
Washington D.C. &lt;/p&gt;

&#8220;There are many of us here. We are making art. We are in the
museums. The times are changing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guests crunched on spring vegetables sprinkled with truffle
vinaigrette. The long dinner tables were decked out by artists.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s
largest software maker, rose the most in three months after it
reported fiscal third-quarter profit that topped estimates on
better-than-expected sales of Windows and Office software for
businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income slipped to $5.11 billion, or 60 cents a share,
from $5.23 billion, or 61 cents, a year earlier, Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft said yesterday in a statement.
Analysts had predicted an average 57 cents in profit, according
to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 6 percent to
$17.4 billion, beating the $17.2 billion average projection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, whose Windows business had missed analyst
estimates in four of the prior five quarters, surprised
investors with better-than-expected results as corporate demand
for Windows computers made up for tepid interest from consumers
opting for tablet machines. The company plans later this year to
release Windows 8, the newest version of its operating system,
to help it win back consumers and narrow Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s lead in
the tablet market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s been a while since Windows did better than the
broader PC market,&#8221; said Pat Becker Jr., a fund manager at
Becker Capital Management (NLY) in Portland, Oregon, who owns
Microsoft shares. &#8220;Those trends we&#8217;ve seen over the past year
that the corporate market has been robust continued into Q1.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Product Debuts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares increased 4.6 percent to $32.42 as of the
close in New York, for the biggest advance since Jan. 20. The
stock has climbed 25 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;d characterize it as jumping high over a low hurdle,&#8221;
Rick Sherlund, an analyst at Nomura Equity research, said in a
radio interview on &#8220;Bloomberg Surveillance&#8221; with Tom Keene.
&#8220;We&#8217;re really waiting for these new products to ship and to
really reinvigorate the whole PC market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft gave its first look at operating-cost projections
for the fiscal year that starts July 1, saying expenses will be
$30.3 billion to $30.9 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s a gain of as much as 8 percent, higher than this
year&#8217;s increase, as the company plans for costs related to
product debuts in Windows and Office, Microsoft Chief Financial
Officer Peter Klein said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current year, expenses will be $28.3 billion to
$28.7 billion, lower than a January forecast of $28.5 billion to
$28.9 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expenses are under renewed scrutiny because Microsoft&#8217;s
revenue growth is slowing, said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC
Partners LP in New York, who recommends buying Microsoft shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Windows Gaining &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales in the current fiscal year are predicted by analysts
to rise 6 percent, compared with 12 percent in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s all about cost discipline because revenue growth
isn&#8217;t great,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unearned revenue, a measure of future sales, was $15.2
billion, above the $14.9 billion average estimate compiled by
Bloomberg. Profit in the year-ago quarter was boosted by a 5-
cent-a-share tax benefit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows division sales rose 4 percent to $4.62 billion,
compared with the $4.2 billion average estimate, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. That was the fastest growth since
the quarter that ended Sept. 30, 2010, Microsoft said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are seeing year-over-year growth in Windows again, and
it&#8217;s actually looking like it&#8217;s growing faster than PCs,&#8221; said
Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities LLC in
Portland, Oregon, who has a neutral rating on the shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Office Outpaces &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue in the Business division, mostly from Office
software, rose 9.1 percent to $5.81 billion. That shows that
demand for Office 2010 software, which was released in mid-2010,
has persisted longer than would be expected for an almost two-
year-old product, Microsoft&#8217;s Klein said. Analysts on average
had projected $5.6 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Office has &#8220;frankly been better than you would normally
expect at this point in the cycle,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Windows division was bolstered by purchases of Windows
7 software from enterprise customers. Shipments of corporate
machines rose 8 percent, while consumer demand was flat, Klein
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increase in Windows sales was greater than the overall
increase in PC shipments reported by Gartner Inc. (IT) PC shipments
were better than expected in the first quarter, according to
market-research firm Gartner, rising 1.9 percent, instead of the
1.2 percent drop Gartner had forecast. The PC market is shaking
off the impact of the European debt crisis and a disk-drive
shortage resulting from last year&#8217;s flooding in Thailand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Households that used to purchase cheap netbook computers
are switching to such devices as tablet computers, he said. A
new iPad went on sale last month and sold 3 million units in its
debut weekend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Windows 8 Cometh &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft probably won&#8217;t be able to alter that trend until
Windows 8 ships, Klein said in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the company has declined to say when Windows 8 will
go on sale, people with knowledge of the matter said last month
that Microsoft will finish work on the product this summer and
put it on sale around October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another area of consumer weakness showed up in the division
that includes Xbox, where sales declined 16 percent to $1.62
billion, below analysts&#8217; average estimate for sales of $2.1
billion. In what Microsoft termed a &#8220;soft&#8221; console market, the
company sold only 1.4 million Xbox 360 machines, down 48 percent
from the year-ago quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft doesn&#8217;t plan to market a new version of its
gaming console until 2013 at the earliest, people with knowledge
of the matter said last month. That means Microsoft will need to
squeeze a few more quarters of sales from the device, and that
weaker demand for the current machine is a concern, Barnicle
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rich Ross, chairman of Walt Disney
Co. (DIS)&#8217;s film unit, resigned following the company&#8217;s $200 million
loss on the science-fiction picture &#8220;John Carter,&#8221; possibly
the biggest ever for a single movie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The departure of Ross, 50, who has run the division since
October 2009 and previously led the Disney Channel, was
announced today in a statement. A successor wasn&#8217;t named. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger&#8217;s strategy of
producing fewer films, built around marketable characters such
as those from its Pixar and Marvel units, faltered with the
failure of &#8220;John Carter.&#8221; The movie will lead to a quarterly
loss of as much as $120 million for the studio, the first since
Ross succeeded Dick Cook as chairman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that anybody is shocked,&#8221; said Martin Pyykkonen, an analyst with Wedge Partners in Greenwood Village,
Colorado, who doesn&#8217;t rate stocks. &#8220;&#8216;John Carter&#8217; was a debacle
and probably the last straw,&#8221; he said, citing past
disappointments including &#8220;Mars Needs Moms.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, gained 0.6 percent to
$42.35 at the close in New York. The shares have risen 13
percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ross, a 15-year Disney veteran, previously worked at and
led the Disney Channel, creating shows including &#8220;High School
Musical&#8221; and &#8220;Hannah Montana,&#8221; starring Miley Cyrus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I appreciate his countless contributions throughout his
entire career at Disney, and expect he will have tremendous
success in whatever he chooses to do next,&#8221; Iger said in the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Studio Ranking &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney ranks seventh among studios in 2012 domestic ticket
sales with $186.7 million, according to researcher Box Office
Mojo. &#8220;John Carter,&#8221; made for about $250 million, generated
$269.4 million in worldwide ticket sales, a sum shared with
cinema operators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film went over budget and was poorly marketed,
Pyykkonen said. Studio marketing chief MT Carney, an outsider
hired by Ross in 2010, left in January, before the movie opened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew Harrigan, an analyst at Wunderlich Securities in
Denver who has followed the industry for 20 years, said last
month the loss on &#8220;John Carter&#8221; was the biggest he&#8217;d seen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The studio&#8217;s &#8220;Marvel&#8217;s The Avengers,&#8221; estimated by
Internet Movie Database to cost $220 million, opens May 4 to
mark the start of the traditional summer film season in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney reports fiscal second-quarter earnings on May 8. The
company is expected to post a profit of 57 cents a share, the
average of 28 estimates compiled by Bloomberg, on revenue of
$9.56 billion. The company had net income of $942 million, or 49
cents a share, on revenue of $9.08 billion a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks rose, halting a two-day
decline in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index, as profits from
companies including Microsoft (MSFT) Corp. and General Electric Co. (GE)
beat estimates and German business confidence improved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities pared gains as Apple Inc. (AAPL) slumped 2.5 percent,
extending its decline since April 9 to 9.9 percent. Microsoft,
the largest software maker, rallied 4.6 percent. GE jumped 1.2
percent as profit gains at the energy business outpaced finance
for the first time in two years. McDonald&#8217;s Corp. (MCD) advanced 0.7
percent after reporting higher-than-estimated earnings. Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) lost 4.7 percent, driving financial shares lower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 increased 0.1 percent to 1,378.54 at 4 p.m. New
York time, paring a gain of as much as 0.8 percent. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average advanced 65.24 points, or 0.5 percent,
to 13,029.34. The Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.2 percent to
3,000.45. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Earnings are still playing into it,&#8221; Brian Jacobsen, who
helps oversee $211 billion as chief portfolio strategist at
Wells Fargo Advantage Funds in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, said
during an interview. &#8220;In addition, the German data was
encouraging. It tells us that there&#8217;s the ability in Europe to
solve their debt crisis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s rally extended this year&#8217;s gain in the SP 500 to
9.6 percent as investors bought stocks amid better-than-
estimated economic and corporate data. Earnings per share have
topped forecasts at 85 percent of SP 500 companies that
reported results since April 10, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Stocks also gained as German business confidence
unexpectedly increased to a nine-month high in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysts surveyed by Bloomberg raised their first-
quarter earnings estimates for SP 500 companies this week. Per-
share profits grew 3.3 percent in the first three months of the
year, Bloomberg data showed. That&#8217;s up from last week&#8217;s
projection for a 1.7 percent increase. Earnings per share will
grow 8.8 percent during all of 2012, according to the data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Jef Feeley" date="Apr 20, 2012  2:32 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-20/pfizer-ordered-to-pay-4-million-in-damages-in-prempro-case-1-.html"><headline>Pfizer Ordered to Pay $4 Million in Damages in Prempro Case</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) must pay at least
$4 million in damages to a woman who developed breast cancer
after taking the company&#8217;s Prempro menopause drug, a jury in
Connecticut ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jurors in federal court in New Haven ruled April 18 that
Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth unit was liable for causing Margaret Fraser&#8217;s
cancer and that Prempro was an &#8220;unreasonably dangerous
product,&#8221; Greg Bubalo, one of Fraser&#8217;s lawyers, said in a
telephone interview today. The panel also found Wyeth should pay
punitive damages over its handling of the drug, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury concluded that Wyeth&#8217;s handling of the drug &#8220;was
reckless and they had misrepresented the risks and benefits of
its drug to patients and doctors,&#8221; Bubalo said. A federal judge
will decide later how much in punitive damages Pfizer must pay,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 6 million women took Prempro and related
menopause drugs to treat symptoms such as hot flashes and mood
swings before a 2002 study highlighted their links to cancer.
Wyeth&#8217;s sales of the medicines, which are still on the market,
topped $2 billion before the release of the Women&#8217;s Health
Initiative, a National Institutes of Health-sponsored study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Premarin,
Wyeth&#8217;s estrogen-based drug, with progestin-laden Provera, made
by Pfizer&#8217;s Upjohn unit, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth
combined the two hormones in its Prempro pill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Legal Options &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are disappointed with the verdict and will evaluate
our legal options once the court completes its work in this
case,&#8221; Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said in an e-mailed
statement. &#8220;Since the case is continuing, it would not be
appropriate to comment any further at this time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth and Upjohn units have now lost 11 of 20
Prempro cases decided by juries since trials began in 2006,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based drugmaker got some of those verdicts
thrown out after trial or had the awards reduced. It resolved
some of the verdicts through settlements, while other decisions
are on appeal. Pfizer also has had cases thrown out before trial
and settled others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer announced in May 2011 that it had settled a third of
the pending Prempro cases and had set aside $772 million to help
resolve the claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jurors in Fraser&#8217;s case found Wyeth officials failed to
properly warn the retired public-school principal about
Prempro&#8217;s risks, said Neal Moscow, another lawyer who
represented the plaintiff in the case. Moscow said the jury
foreperson was a lawyer for the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office in
Connecticut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Extreme Conduct &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The jury found Wyeth&#8217;s conduct was so extreme that it
warranted an award of punitive damages,&#8221; the lawyer said.
Fraser, 66, is from Lakeville, Connecticut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moscow said U.S. District Judge Janet Bond Arterton in New
Haven hasn&#8217;t said when she&#8217;ll decide how much in punitive
damages Pfizer must pay in connection with the verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last Prempro verdict against Pfizer and its units
five months ago, a Philadelphia jury awarded more than $72
million to three women who blamed their breast cancers on drugs
made by Wyeth and Pharmacia Upjohn. Pfizer later settled those
cases for undisclosed sums. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company convinced a federal-court jury in Nebraska last
month to throw out claims that Prempro was the cause of a
woman&#8217;s breast cancer and Wyeth should be held liable for
damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Connecticut case is Fraser v. Wyeth Inc., 3:04-1373,
U.S. District Court, District of Connecticut (New Haven). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Inc. (MSFT) should sell its Bing
search business to Facebook Inc. (FB), a deal worth about $5 billion
that would help both companies compete with Google (GOOG) Inc., said
Rick Sherlund, an analyst at Nomura Equity Research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If their real motivation for being in the search business
is to prevent Google from having complete market dominance,
Microsoft would be better off working with Facebook,&#8221; Sherlund
said today in an interview on Bloomberg Radio&#8217;s &#8220;Bloomberg
Surveillance&#8221; with Tom Keene and Ken Prewitt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sherlund said Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software
maker, has &#8220;clearly lost&#8221; the battle for search market share
to Google and could boost earnings by 6 to 8 percent by
eliminating the &#8220;drag&#8221; of Bing, he said. Facebook would also
benefit from a partnership, Sherlund said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Facebook needs to be in the search business,&#8221; Sherlund
said. &#8220;It&#8217;s an enormous monetization opportunity for them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft already owns almost 2 percent of Facebook, making
a future agreement more likely, he said. The company would
probably get back about 80 percent of monetized search traffic
from Facebook with none of the associated costs, according to
Sherlund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He estimated a $5 billion purchase price for the Bing unit,
or two times 2011 annual sales of $2.5 billion for Microsoft&#8217;s
online services division. Sherlund projected that Microsoft will
lose $2 billion from Bing this year, amounting to about a six
percentage-point impact on its operating margins. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gulf Coast gasoline gained after an

&lt;p&gt;An instrument panel malfunction at the plant caused the

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) Chief Executive
Officer Robert Iger&#8217;s franchise-focused movie strategy will
survive the downfall of the company&#8217;s movie chief even after
&#8220;John Carter&#8221; lost $200 million, analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s biggest entertainment company, Burbank,
California-based Disney has cut its film releases in half to 12
this year and targeted spending on large-budget pictures that
have the potential to be long-lived, consumer franchises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The perils of betting big were underscored with the
science-fiction flop &#8220;John Carter,&#8221; which led to possibly the
largest loss ever on a single film. Iger spent $7 billion on
Pixar in 2006 and $4.2 billion on Marvel in 2009 to acquire
intellectual property for films, theme-park rides, toys and
other merchandise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategy was &#8220;set by Iger himself,&#8221; Matt Harrigan, an
analyst with Wunderlich Securities in Denver, said in an e-mail.
He has a hold rating on Disney stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich Ross, who resigned as studio chairman yesterday and
presided over the release of &#8220;John Carter,&#8221; wasn&#8217;t a good fit
for the role, according to analysts as well as Ross&#8217;s memo to
staff, which cited a lack of passion for the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ross faced a difficult transition to the movie business
from the Disney Channel cable network after Iger moved him to
the studio in October 2009, Harrigan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hollywood Newbies &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ross and executives under him with little film experience
mishandled the marketing of &#8220;John Carter,&#8221; said Peter Sealey,
a former executive at Columbia Pictures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MT Carney, the New York advertising executive who Ross
recruited to run film-studio marketing, quit in January after 20
months, ahead of the &#8220;John Carter&#8221; release. She directed
campaigns for hits including &#8220;The Help,&#8221; &#8220;Cars 2&#8221; and
&#8220;Pirates of the Caribbean,&#8221; and also disappointments like
&#8220;Secretariat&#8221; and &#8220;Mars Needs Moms.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company hasn&#8217;t named a replacement for Ross. Those
mentioned as possible candidates by outsiders include DreamWorks
Studios co-Chairman and CEO Stacey Snider, Marvel Studios&#8217;
president of production, Kevin Feige, and Mary Parent, the
former studio head at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;ll be someone in the industry, someone with gravitas
and credentials,&#8221; Sealey said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lagging Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Kaltman, a spokeswoman for Disney&#8217;s film unit,
declined to comment on succession plans. Feige didn&#8217;t respond to
a message left at his office. Chip Sullivan, a spokesman for
DreamWorks Studios, declined to comment. Parent didn&#8217;t respond
to an e-mailed request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney ranks seventh among studios this year, with domestic
ticket sales of $186.7 million as of April 15, according to
researcher Box Office Mojo. That&#8217;s last among the major studios
and also behind Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (LGF), which has 2012&#8217;s
biggest hit so far in &#8220;The Hunger Games.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Marvel&#8217;s The Avengers&#8221; makes its debut on May 4 for
Disney, and is expected to be among the year&#8217;s top-grossing
pictures with an estimated $370 million in domestic ticket
sales, according to Phil Contrino, editor of film researcher
BoxOffice.com. The company&#8217;s next major release, Pixar&#8217;s
&#8220;Brave,&#8221; may take in $200 million domestically after its June
22 debut, Contrino said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Franchise Strength &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney added 0.6 percent to $42.35 yesterday in New York
trading. The shares have risen 13 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo explained the company&#8217;s
strategy at an analyst event last year. Sequels such as Pixar&#8217;s
&#8220;Toy Story 3&#8221; can generate $9 billion in retail sales, mostly
from consumer products such as games and books, far more than a
stand-alone, non-franchise picture, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some 80 percent of film-unit production spending went
toward franchises last year, up from 40 percent in 2010, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t see this changing the studio strategy of focusing
on Disney and Marvel-branded stories,&#8221; Alan Gould, an analyst
with New York-based Evercore Partners, said in an e-mail. He has
an overweight or buy rating on the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of &#8220;John Carter,&#8221; the studio will report an
operating loss of as much as $120 million for the quarter that
ended March 31, the company has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Profit Struggle &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney releases fiscal second-quarter earnings on May 8 and
is projected to report profit of 57 cents a share, up from 49
cents in the same period last year, according to an average of
28 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger&#8217;s franchise-focused movie strategy has yet to
translate into enhanced profitability for the studio, said
Martin Pyykkonen, an analyst at Wedge Partners in Greenwood
Village, Colorado, who doesn&#8217;t rate the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The film biz has really been their Achilles&#8217; heel,&#8221; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc. (FB) is beefing up its
intellectual property arsenal by paying $550 million for some of
the patents Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) recently agreed to buy from AOL Inc. (AOL) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook, the world&#8217;s largest social network, will obtain
about 650 AOL patents and applications, as well as a license to
AOL patents and applications that Microsoft will purchase and
own, the companies said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patent disputes are increasing in the technology industry
as competitors fight over intellectual property rights to key
breakthroughs in areas, such as mobile technology and social
media. The Microsoft deal may bolster Facebook&#8217;s defense against
infringement allegations by Yahoo! Inc., said Brian Wieser, an
analyst at Pivotal Research Group LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s deal &#8220;helps Facebook, hurts Yahoo,&#8221; said Brian
Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research Group LLC. &#8220;Yahoo is
counting on seeing some money from Facebook, and maybe didn&#8217;t
expect such vigorous defense.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said earlier this month that it would pay $1.06
billion for a portfolio of AOL&#8217;s patents. Under the terms of the
auction, companies couldn&#8217;t band together to bid jointly, and
AOL didn&#8217;t permit offers for part of the portfolio, said a
person with knowledge of the matter, who declined to be named
because the negotiations were private. Microsoft bid with the
intention of reselling most of the patents and always considered
Facebook the most likely buyer, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Selling Opportunity &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Anytime someone buys a huge amount of patents, there&#8217;s an
opportunity to sell the ones you don&#8217;t need,&#8221; said Ron Laurie,
managing director of Inflexion Point Strategy LLC in Palo Alto,
California, which counsels companies on intellectual property
purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AOL, under shareholder pressure to reverse sales declines,
sold and licensed more than 800 patents to Microsoft earlier
this month. AOL would still hold more than 300 patents and
applications after the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The portfolio that AOL is selling includes patents that
cover e-mail, instant messaging, browsing, search, advertising
and other Internet-related technologies, according to another
person with knowledge of the matter. The patents also cover
handsets, e-commerce and long-term evolution (LTE) wireless
communications, this person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Thaw, a spokesman for Facebook, declined to
comment. Kevin Kutz, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft, and Maureen Sullivan, who represents New York-based
AOL, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Facebook&#8217;s Earlier Effort &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook made an offer for AOL&#8217;s patent portfolio before
losing out to a higher Microsoft bid, two people with knowledge
of the matter said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft was particularly interested in AOL&#8217;s search
patents and many of those will probably be among those it
retains, the person with knowledge of the matter said today.
Microsoft expects the transaction to close this year and doesn&#8217;t
expect regulatory obstacles, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though Microsoft didn&#8217;t want to own the majority of
the patents, it did want a license to all of them -- which it
will get through this agreement. Microsoft also would have
viewed a purchase by a rival like Google Inc. (GOOG) as negative, said
the person with knowledge of the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook, based in Menlo Park, California, has lined up $8
billion of available credit from its IPO underwriters. Like more
established technology companies, such as Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google,
it is buying intellectual property to protect itself from
patent-infringement litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yahoo Sues &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook acquired 750 patents from International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM), a person with knowledge of the matter said on
March 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo, the largest U.S. Web portal, sued Facebook on March
12, alleging that the social network infringed patents covering
such functions as Internet advertising and information sharing.
Facebook fired back on April 3, accusing Yahoo of infringing on
10 patents through its home page and Flickr photo-sharing
service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nothing about today&#8217;s action changes the fact that
Facebook continues to infringe our patents,&#8221; Yahoo said today
in a statement. &#8220;Companies who purchase patents are often
working from a position of weakness and take these actions to
strengthen their portfolio. We see today&#8217;s announcement as a
validation of our case against Facebook.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook in February filed for an initial public offering,
seeking to raise $5 billion in what could be the largest
Internet IPO on record. The company may seek a valuation of $75
billion to $100 billion, people familiar with the matter have
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AOL fell 1 percent to $24.75 at the close in New York.
Microsoft declined less than 1 percent to $32.12. Yahoo, based
in Sunnyvale, California, slid 1.7 percent to $15.33. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Jeffrey McCracken" date="Apr 23, 2012  6:09 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-23/nestle-is-said-to-plan-pfizer-asset-sales-to-appease-regulators.html"><headline>Nestle Said to Plan Pfizer Asset Sales to Sooth Regulator</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Nestle SA (NESN) may sell as much as $1.8
billion of the infant-nutrition assets it is buying from Pfizer
Inc. (PFE) as antitrust concerns in countries such as Mexico force
divestitures, said people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 10 percent to 15 percent of the $11.9 billion unit
may be put up for sale by Nestle, said the people, who declined
to be identified because the discussions are private. The Vevey,
Switzerland-based company has overlapping baby-food businesses
in more than a dozen countries and may eventually have to sell
divisions in places including Australia, Venezuela and Thailand,
the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestle, the world&#8217;s biggest foodmaker, plans to meet with
regulators in the countries where it operates during the coming
weeks and months to determine which assets it may have to
divest, the people said. Some private-equity funds and consumer-product companies such as HJ Heinz Co. or Abbott Laboratories
may be interested in these assets when they come on the block,
the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is premature to comment on and prejudge the decisions
of the regulatory authorities,&#8221; Robin Tickle, a Nestle
spokesman, said by telephone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A forced sale of assets in Australia and some Latin
American countries could help companies that are looking to
expand in those regions, Credit Suisse Group AG analysts Robert Moskow and Marcela Giraldo said in a report last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Buying Assets &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heinz Chief Executive Officer William R. Johnson said in
February that the Pittsburgh-based company would consider
&#8220;bolt-on acquisitions in emerging markets to accelerate
growth,&#8221; though it has been primarily focused on organic
expansion. Michael Mullen, a Heinz spokesman, declined to
comment beyond Johnson&#8217;s remarks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adelle Infante, an Abbott spokeswoman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assets Nestle may need to sell have annual earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $60
million to $90 million, the people said. They may fetch $1.2
billion to $1.8 billion based on the multiple Nestle is paying
for the entire unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestle is already the top seller of infant-nutrition
products and the purchase of Pfizer&#8217;s business will help the
company regain traction in the Chinese baby-food market, where
it has been losing market share since 2005. The Pfizer unit gets
about 85 percent of sales from emerging markets such as Asia,
Africa and the Middle East. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer picked Nestle to buy the infant-nutrition unit over
Danone SA, which had even greater antitrust hurdles, especially
in China, people familiar with the matter said. Danone had
previously tried to partner with Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. in a
deal that would have pre-sold some of the Pfizer assets where
there was risk of overlap, said these people. The talks between
Danone and Mead Johnson had broken down by the final round of
bidding, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We look at both organic and external growth
opportunities, but we do not speculate on specific actions,
investments or geographies,&#8221; Chris Perille, a spokesman for
Mead Johnson, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Dermot Doherty" date="Apr 23, 2012  6:00 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-23/danone-infant-options-limited-after-nestle-clinches-pfizer-unit.html"><headline>Danone Infant Options Limited as Nestle Gets Pfizer Unit</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Danone, beaten by Nestle (NESN) SA in an
$11.9 billion contest to acquire Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s nutrition unit,
may have to scale back its expansion ambitions in the baby-food
market after losing out on one of the industry&#8217;s main prizes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maker of Activia and Actimel yogurts could try to buy
parts of the Pfizer business that Nestle has to divest because
of antitrust obstacles, though has few other alternatives,
according to Jeff Stent, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas in
London. Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. (MJN), the baby-formula maker that
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. took public in February 2009, is a
possibility, though with a market value of about $17 billion may
be too large to swallow, even if it&#8217;s available, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s smaller baby-food businesses around, but this was
pretty unique,&#8221; Stent said of Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth unit. &#8220;Pfizer was
almost bigger than ideal but it was still doable and a fantastic
strategic fit. There isn&#8217;t a Pfizer part two.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danone (BN) lost out to Nestle by less than $250 million, or 2
percent of the final $11.9 billion bid, said a person familiar
with the matter, putting in a bid higher than $11.6 billion.
That price difference along with concerns Pfizer had about
Danone&#8217;s ability to get antitrust approval for the deal in
China, gave the asset to Nestle, said two people familiar with
the matter. &lt;/p&gt;

Danone gets more than half its revenue from fresh dairy products, while infant nutrition accounts for only a fifth of its sales. Close
&lt;/p&gt;
</body></entry><entry author="By Drew Armstrong" date="Apr 23, 2012  4:18 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-23/pfizer-says-cash-from-nestle-deal-will-go-to-share-buybacks-1-.html"><headline>Pfizer Says Cash From Nestle Deal Will Go to Share Buybacks</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), with almost $27
billion in its existing cash hoard, will add more with the $12
billion sale of its infant nutrition unit, opening the way for
buybacks that will help shore up the shares as the company
cycles in new products over the next several years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, will initially use
the &#8220;vast majority&#8221; of the money from the sale to buy back
shares, rather than pouring the money into expensive
acquisitions, said Mark Schoenebaum, a pharmaceutical industry
analyst with ISI Group Inc. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t expect a major MA deal,&#8221; Schoenebaum said in a
conference call with investors today. &#8220;There&#8217;s been this
speculation that they might buy Bristol-Myers, but that&#8217;s not
going to happen in our opinion.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer needs new products as it enters an era without
Lipitor, the cholesterol pill that lost patent protection in
2011 after generating $9.58 billion in revenue. The New York-
based company doesn&#8217;t have a drug in its pipeline that will
replace all of Lipitor&#8217;s sales. Instead, it&#8217;s trying to fill the
hole with several products, including two under review by U.S.
regulators for possible approval this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tofacitinib, an arthritis pill, could be worth $1.1 billion
million for Pfizer by 2017, according to John Boris, an analyst
with Citigroup in New York. Eliquis, a blood thinner developed
with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., could be worth $3 billion, though
those sales will be split. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Revenue Cut &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Divestitures of two Pfizer units will cut revenue by about
10 percent once completed this year. Buybacks and a spinoff of
the animal-health business, expected to be announced before July
1, could cut Pfizer&#8217;s share count by as much as 15 percent and
boost earnings per share by 20 cents, Schoenebaum said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer announced the $11.9 billion sale of its infant
nutrition unit to Vevey, Switzerland-based Nestle SA (NESN) today.
Pfizer shares fell less than 1 percent to $22.38 at the close in
New York. The stock has gained 3.4 percent so far this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price of the nutrition unit was at the &#8220;upper end&#8221; of
expectations, said Seamus Fernandez, an analyst with Leerink
Swann  Co. in Boston who has a market perform rating on Pfizer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale &#8220;should be viewed as a positive,&#8221; Fernandez said
in a note to clients today. &#8220;The attractive valuation around
today&#8217;s sale will very likely be well received by investors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement today, Chief Executive Officer Ian Read
reiterated comments that Pfizer&#8217;s free cash would be used for
buybacks before anything else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Case to Beat&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect to allocate the after-tax proceeds to further
share repurchases, or invest in other business-development
opportunities, with the return on share repurchases remaining
our case to beat,&#8221; Read said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s evolved to a phase of its corporate life
where it&#8217;s no longer rapidly growing as it did over the last
decade, said Paul Danos, dean of the Tuck School of Business at
Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Read, the drugmaker is shifting from quickly adding
mass to cutting fat and focusing on what it wants to do best,
Danos said in a telephone interview from Hanover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;ll come a time when you have a more elegant
organization,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with cutting units, the company&#8217;s is also shrinking
expenses. Read has said he plans to cut another $1 billion from
the company&#8217;s expenses this year, specifically focusing on what
the company describes as selling, informational and
administrative costs. Severance packages for workers who are
fired are to be cut in May, as part of that plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Animal-Health Unit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s animal-health unit, which generated $4.18 billion
in 2011 revenue, will be spun off in an initial public offering
that may be announced before June, people familiar with the
proceedings have said. The company has hired JPMorgan Chase 
Co., Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley to handle that
deal, said one of the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s sale is the largest for a nutrition business of 77
deals in the last three years, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The next largest was when Bristol-Myers split off its
majority stake in Mead Johnson in 2009, leaving the food company
with a $8.94 billion market capitalization at the end of that
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $11.9 billion cash sale to Nestle closed a contest
between the Swiss food company and Paris-based Danone (BN), which
also offered about $11 billion for the unit. Pfizer made the
decision to sell to Nestle yesterday after months of negotiating
with potential buyers, according to a person familiar with the
process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Dermot Doherty" date="Apr 23, 2012  4:11 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-23/nestle-agrees-to-buy-pfizer-baby-food-unit-for-11-9-billion-1-.html"><headline>Nestle to Acquire Pfizer Baby Food Unit for $11.9 Billion</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Nestle SA (NESN), the world&#8217;s biggest food
company, agreed to buy Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s infant-nutrition unit for
$11.9 billion, edging out Danone in a contest for a business
that gets most of its sales in fast-growing emerging markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchase, Nestle&#8217;s biggest since it bought pet-food
maker Ralston Purina Co. in 2001, will lead to annual cost
benefits of $160 million and will boost earnings per share in
the first full year, Chief Executive Officer Paul Bulcke said
today on a conference call. The unit will increase Nestle&#8217;s
annual sales of infant formula to $7 billion from $5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestle&#8217;s offer beat a bid of about $11 billion from Danone,
according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The
acquisition will help the Vevey, Switzerland-based company,
already the top seller of infant-nutrition products, regain
traction in the Chinese baby-food market, where it has been
losing market share since 2005. The Pfizer unit gets about 85
percent of sales from emerging markets such as Asia, Africa and
the Middle East. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;From a long-term perspective, it makes strategic sense as
it will really strengthen Nestle&#8217;s position in Asia,&#8221; said Jon Cox, an analyst at Kepler Capital Markets in Zurich. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer fell less than 1 percent to $22.38 at the close in
New York. Nestle fell 2.8 percent in Zurich as the shares
started trading without the right to a dividend. Adjusted for
that, the stock rose 0.6 percent to 55.50 Swiss francs. Danone
rose (BN) 1.3 percent to 53.13 euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Acquisition Multiple &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestle will fund the purchase through a combination of debt
and cash, according to Chief Financial Officer Wan Ling Martello. The Swiss company had 7.9 billion Swiss francs ($8.6
billion) in cash and short-term investments at the end of 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestle said it&#8217;s paying 19.8 times 2012 earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of the Pfizer unit.
The multiple falls to 15.6 times after estimated cost savings,
according to the Nestle. The price &#8220;seems realistic for an
asset that&#8217;s almost 100 percent in emerging markets,&#8221; said
Marco Gulpers, an analyst at ING Bank NV in Amsterdam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, Danone paid about 22 times Ebitda for baby-food
company Royal Numico NV, Merrill Lynch analysts said at the
time. The same year, Nestle paid Novartis AG 15.7 times Ebitda
for its Gerber baby-food division, while last year the Swiss
company paid 16.8 times for Chinese candy maker Hsu Fu Chi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestle, which was advised by Deutsche Bank AG and
Rothschild, may have been perceived by Pfizer as having fewer
regulatory obstacles to overcome than Danone, Gulpers said. The
acquisition is the second-biggest announced this year, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg, behind Glencore International
Inc.&#8217;s $45 billion bid for Xstrata Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two Major Exits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;From a regulatory perspective, Nestle does make more
sense,&#8221; the analyst said, adding that Europe and China would
have presented hurdles for Danone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulcke declined to comment on possible regulatory
complications. Agnes Berthet-d&#8217;Anthonay, a spokeswoman for
Danone, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale will be Pfizer&#8217;s largest divestiture since the
$16.6 billion sale of consumer-health brands including Sudafed
cold medicine and Bengay pain cream to Johnson  Johnson in
2006. It is the first of two major exits that Chief Executive
Officer Ian Read outlined to shrink the New York-based company
and concentrate on producing new drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s nutrition business includes infant formulas such
as SMA and Promil. The unit, which also makes Enercal
supplements for adults, sells products in more than 60
countries, according to its website, and accounted for 3.2
percent of the company&#8217;s 2011 revenue. Pfizer gained the formula
division through its $68 billion purchase of Wyeth in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Animal-Health Spinoff &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer had the fifth-largest global market share of the
infant-formula business in 2010, trailing Nestle, Mead-Johnson
Nutrition Co., (MJN) Danone, and Abbott Laboratories (ABT), according to
research company Euromonitor International. Its market positions
are strongest in the Middle East and Africa, and in the Asia-Pacific region, where Pfizer&#8217;s unit is the third- and fourth-largest respectively, said Euromonitor analyst Lee Linthicum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global sales of baby-food products are likely to gain 6
percent a year from 2011 to 2016, helped by low private-label
penetration and the importance of infant nutrition to consumers,
according to Euromonitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale is the largest for a nutrition business of 77
deals in the last three years, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The next largest was when Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.
split off its majority stake in Mead Johnson in 2009, leaving
the food company with a $8.94 billion market capitalization at
the end of that year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the infant-nutrition business, Read is also
spinning off Pfizer&#8217;s animal-health unit, which had $4.18
billion in 2011 revenue. The drugmaker is planning an initial
public offering for the unit and has hired JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley to handle that deal, a
person with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley and Centerview Partners advised Pfizer on
the sale of the infant-nutrition unit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is
offering a certificate of deposit that pays a fixed return when
two measures fall within certain ranges, the bank&#8217;s first such
offering in a market where record-low yields are driving demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called &#8220;range accrual&#8221; 15-year CD yields 5 percent
annually when the London interbank offered rate is from 0 to 6
percent, and the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index exceeds 80 percent
of its initial value, according to a preliminary disclosure
document. New York-based Goldman started offering market-linked,
or structured, CDs in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of the products in the U.S. reached a record last
year as the Federal Reserve held interest rates near zero for a
third year. The deposits, which combine debt with derivatives,
return principal at maturity and offer the opportunity for
higher gains than with typical fixed-rate CDs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiffany Galvin, a spokeswoman for Goldman, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most investors will have difficulty determining whether the
5 percent on the Goldman CD is a good payout for the underlying
bet, said Michael Davis, a partner at Varick Asset Management in
New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For the near term, you&#8217;ll likely get 5 percent, but five
years from now, that might be year one of 10 years of no
coupon,&#8221; Davis, who sold structured products while at Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., said in a telephone interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7 Percent Fee &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The product, which is callable, is Goldman&#8217;s first CD tied
to both rates and equities, according to a person with knowledge
of the offering who declined to be identified because terms
aren&#8217;t set. The total fee will be about 7 percent, or 4 percent
for distribution and a 3 percent hedging fee, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks sold a record 1,271 of structured CDs in the U.S.
last year, according to StructuredRetailProducts.com, a database
used by the industry. Rates on five-year, fixed-rate CDs have
fallen to 1.49 percent, the lowest level since at least June
1998, according to data from Bankrate.com. That compares with
4.4 percent in December 2007 at the start of the worst recession
since the 1930s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derivatives are contracts whose value is derived from
stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities. The London interbank
offered rate, or Libor, is the rate at which banks say they can
borrow in dollars from each other. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook will take ownership of about 650 AOL patents and

&lt;p&gt;Nestle SA, (NESN) the world&#8217;s biggest food
maker, plans to fund its $11.9 billion acquisition of Pfizer
Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s baby-food unit with debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The acquisition will be fully debt financed, namely
through internal cash resources and through the bond markets,&#8221;
Chris Hogg, a spokesman for Vevey, Switzerland-based Nestle,
said in an e-mail. Hogg declined to disclose details of the debt
financing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A debt-funded acquisition may put &#8220;some rating pressure&#8221;
on Nestle, as its net borrowing could rise above the
management&#8217;s target range of 15 billion francs ($16.4 billion)
to 18 billion francs for 2012 and 2013, Fitch Ratings said April
19. Fitch ranks Nestle at AA+, equivalent to Moody&#8217;s Investors
Service&#8217;s Aa1 rating, while Standard  Poor&#8217;s grades it at AA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchase will help Nestle, already the top seller of
infant-nutrition products, regain traction in the Chinese baby-food market, where it has been losing market share since 2005.
The Pfizer unit gets about 85 percent of sales from emerging
markets such as Asia, Africa and the Middle East. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction is subject to regulatory approval, Nestle
said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If this deal goes through, we think that Nestle will most
likely be required by regulators to sell some of their
businesses in certain countries due to issues about market
share,&#8221; said Michie Yana, a senior investment analyst at
European Credit Management Ltd. in London. &#8220;The increase of net
debt could well be mitigated by inflows from asset disposals.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spreads Narrow &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestle has 7.4 billion francs of bonds outstanding,
including 1.8 billion francs of securities due this year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestle&#8217;s $550 million of 2.125 percent bonds due 2014 yield
12 basis points less than the benchmark swap rate, down from as
much as 31 basis points above the benchmark on Jan. 26,
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices show. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost to insure Nestle&#8217;s debt against default was little
changed at 31 basis points, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Credit-default swaps on the foodmaker have fallen 37
percent this year, indicating an improvement in investor
perceptions of the company&#8217;s credit quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestle signed a 4.5 billion-euro ($6 billion) 364-day
credit line in October that pays interest of 10 basis points
more than the euro interbank offered rate on drawn funds,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestle said today the acquisition will lead to annual cost
benefits of $160 million and will boost earnings per share in
the first full year. The Pfizer unit will increase Nestle&#8217;s
sales of infant formula to $7 billion a year from $5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), Citigroup
Inc. (C) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) are teaming up to bid on $7.49
billion of commercial-real estate securities the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York took on in the 2008 rescue of American
International Group Inc., according to three people with
knowledge of the auction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group expects to distribute its preliminary price
estimates tomorrow on the debt, composed of two collateralized
debt obligations issued by Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) in 2007 and 2008.
Final bids are due on April 26 by 9 a.m. in New York, said the
people, who declined to be identified because the negotiations
are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Fed invited eight broker-dealers to compete
for the so-called MAX CDOs after receiving &#8220;several&#8221;
unsolicited bids for the holdings in its Maiden Lane III LLC
portfolio, according to an April 10 statement. The other banks
invited to bid are Barclays Plc (BARC), Deutsche Bank AG, Bank of
America Corp. (BAC), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Nomura Holdings Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Vames, a spokesman for Credit Suisse, Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s Michael DuVally and Citigroup&#8217;s Scott Helfman declined
to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDOs could be sold intact or broken into pieces, though
an interest-rate swap contract with Barclays would need to be
paid out to access the underlying bonds, eating into profits,
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) analysts said in a report last week. The
consortium of the three banks is not looking to break up the
deals, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Swaps Unwound &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two CDOs, which bundle securities culled from 103
commercial mortgage bond deals, are estimated by the Fed to be
worth $4.8 billion as of December, according to the district
bank&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed&#8217;s Maiden Lane vehicle unwound credit-default swaps
that AIG had sold to protect counterparties against losses on
mortgage-backed securities. The facility bought the underlying
assets that AIG insured for banks, sparing the Wall Street firms
from any losses. Lawmakers criticized the payments as a
&#8220;backdoor bailout&#8221; of the companies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) lost a ruling in a patent
lawsuit by IPCom GmbH  Co. over wireless technology that could
remove Nokia third-generation handsets from the German market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia must stop all 3G phone sales in Germany under the
Regional Court of Mannheim&#8217;s ruling, IPCom said April 20 in an
e-mailed statement. Nokia will appeal, spokesman Mark Durrant
said. Most of the phones affected came out before the patent and
today&#8217;s products use different methods, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IPCom, based in Pullach, Germany, is seeking to force Nokia
to pay royalties for a portfolio of mobile-technology patents it
acquired from Robert Bosch GmbH in 2007. The two companies are
entangled in patent litigation across Europe. The ruling
concerns a patent known as 100DE, which is part of a group of
patents that cover how to connect devices to 3G wireless
networks and prioritize them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court ruling &#8220;clearly says that none of Nokia&#8217;s UMTS-
compatible mobile phones must be distributed in the German
market,&#8221; said Bernhard Frohwitter, chief executive officer of
IPCom, referring to 3G devices. &#8220;The decision does not say that
only older models are affected.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mannheim tribunal didn&#8217;t accept that alternative
designs by Nokia didn&#8217;t infringe the patent, and said that all
phones capable of using UMTS 3G technology were affected, IPCom
said in its statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under German law, patent infringement rulings don&#8217;t take
effect immediately. During appeal, the ruling only takes effect
if the winning party enforces it. In such a case, the losing
party as a rule asks the court to halt enforcement while the
matter is pending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IPCom would have to post a bond of at least 100 million
euros ($132 million) if it wants to enforce the injunction while
the case is still pending on appeal, according to the judgment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany was Nokia&#8217;s fifth-biggest market by revenue in 2011
and the largest in Western Europe, according to a company
filing. The market rankings include equipment joint venture
Nokia Siemens Networks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Harley-Davidson Forces Domain Name Change to IronRides.com &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One month after receiving a cease-and-desist letter from
Milwaukee-based Harley-Davidson Inc. (HOG), a Delaware resident
changed the domain name for his motorcycle-fan social-networking
site, the York Daily Record reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jimmy Coulbourne dropped HarleySpace.com in favor of
IronRides.com, even though he told the newspaper &#8220;they&#8217;ll never
convince me that my members are foolish enough to think this
site is owned by Harley.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newspaper provided a link to the letter from Harley-
Davidson&#8217;s trademark counsel, David M. Kelly of Washington-based
Finnegan Henderson Farabow Garrett  Dunner LLP to Coulbourne&#8217;s
lawyer Fritz Clapp, who is also known as the general counsel to
the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the letter, Kelly said that while his client wasn&#8217;t
objecting to the discussions of the Harley-Davidson products on
the website, the HarleySpace domain name was unacceptable
because the public could mistakenly consider it an official
site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;University Licenses &#8216;American Need Farmers&#8217; Mark for $250 &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Iowa Farm Bureau licensed the &#8220;America Needs Farmers&#8221;
trademark from the University of Iowa for a fee of $250 for a
five-year license, the Des Moines Register reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the school has used the mark since 1985, it was
registered as a state trademark in August 2011 on the same day
the license agreement was signed with the Farm Bureau, the
newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two other entities that were also charged a $250 trademark
fee by the university received contracts of less than a year:
Monsanto Co. (MON), which had a four-month contract to place the
school&#8217;s Hawkeye logo on seed corn caps; and Case International
Ltd., which has a one-year contract to distribute T-shirts with
the Hawkeye logo, according to the Register. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;University officials told the Register that the low fee
paid by the farm bureau is balanced by a separate agreement the
bureau has with Learfield Sports Inc.&#8217;s Hawkeye Sports
Properties, which sells marketing opportunities related to the
school&#8217;s athletic programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;China Court Encourages Apple, Proview to Settle IPad Dispute &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Chinese court is mediating talks between Apple Inc. and
Proview Technology (Shenzhen) Co. in a bid to get the companies
to settle their dispute over the iPad trademark in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;On the one hand, we are trying to process this case, and
on the other, we are working on encouraging both sides to
settle,&#8221; Zhao Le, an official at the foreign affairs office of
the Higher People&#8217;s Court of Guangdong, said by telephone April
19. Zhao said he had no further information on the effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Feb. 29, the Guangdong court heard Apple&#8217;s appeal
against a lower court ruling last year that Proview owned the
iPad trademark in China. Proview, a failed maker of computer
displays, has filed separate complaints alleging that Apple&#8217;s
sale of iPad tablets in the country infringed intellectual-
property laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We started work, through the mediation of the court, on
trying to get both sides to settle,&#8221; Roger Xie, a lawyer for
Proview, said by phone. Before issuing rulings, Chinese courts
typically initiate proceedings for litigants to settle, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carolyn Wu, a spokeswoman at Apple in Beijing, didn&#8217;t
immediately return messages sent by mobile phone and e-mail
seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple has said it acquired the rights to the iPad trademark
in China from Proview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proview Technology is a unit of Hong Kong-listed Proview
International Holdings Ltd. (334), whose shares have been suspended
from trading since 2010. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hollywood Studios Lose Australian Piracy Suit at High Court &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) and Viacom Inc. (VIAB)&#8217;s Paramount Pictures are
among Hollywood&#8217;s biggest movie studios that lost a piracy
lawsuit in Australia as the country&#8217;s top court upheld rulings
that a local Internet provider wasn&#8217;t responsible for customers
illegally downloading films. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iinet Ltd., based in Perth, didn&#8217;t authorize the
infringement when customers illegally downloaded pirated copies
of movies, the High Court of Australia ruled, according to a
summary of the decision released on the court&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Village Roadshow Ltd. (VRL)&#8217;s Roadshow Films led the companies
trying to stop iiNet customers from using BitTorrent software to
illegally download copyrighted films, in a precedent-setting
case for Internet providers in Australia. The studios were
appealing earlier court decisions vindicating iiNet, and seeking
damages that they said could include royalties on illegally
downloaded movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Australian government agreed to review the Copyright
Act after Singtel Optus Ltd. was cleared by a judge of
wrongdoing in letting its customers watch downloads of
Australian Football League and National Rugby League games on
mobile devices, sometimes within minutes of the live action on
free-to-air television. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tony Bannon, a lawyer representing the film studios, cited
a case of an iiNet customer downloading a copy of &#8220;Pineapple
Express&#8221; in 2008, which could be identified from the BitTorrent
application information. Iinet failed to warn its customers that
downloading unauthorized content was illegal, Bannon told the
five-member High Court panel at a Dec. 1 hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Without providing a warning of some form, they are
authorizing,&#8221; Bannon said, referring to the Internet provider. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IiNet takes a lot of steps to encourage people to use
legitimate content, Richard Cobden, the company&#8217;s lawyer, told
the court at the same hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet service provider has an agreement with Apple
Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iTunes, for example, that lets customers download films
without affecting their monthly download allowance, Cobden said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An appeal court last year upheld Justice Dennis Cowdroy&#8217;s
2010 verdict that iiNet wasn&#8217;t liable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The High Court judgment supported the company&#8217;s position
and proved the studios&#8217; claims were unfounded, iiNet Chief
Executive Officer Michael Malone said April 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Iinet has never supported or encouraged unauthorized
sharing or file downloading,&#8221; Malone said in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also appealing were Time Warner Inc. (TWX)&#8217;s Warner Bros.
Entertainment Inc., Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., a unit of
News Corp. (NWSA), and 30 other entities who owned or had exclusive
licenses to commercially released films. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Roadshow Films Pty. Ltd. v iiNet
Ltd (IIN).2011/HCATrans 323, High Court of Australia (Canberra). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Google&#8217;s YouTube Must Help Detect Illegal Uploads, Court Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG), the world&#8217;s biggest Internet search engine
company, partly lost a German copyright infringement suit over
how much it must do to remove illegal music videos from its
YouTube website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Hamburg court partly ruled in favor of a suit brought by
German music royalty collecting society GEMA that argued Google
doesn&#8217;t do enough to monitor YouTube content. Google must
implement features to detect future violations if a rights
holder alerts the company, Presiding Judge Heiner Steeneck said
in a ruling that gave both sides reason to declare victory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;But YouTube isn&#8217;t the perpetrator here, it&#8217;s those people
who illegally upload songs,&#8221; Steeneck said. &#8220;That&#8217;s why
YouTube doesn&#8217;t have to search all videos uploaded in the past.
It only has to help detect videos from the moment it is alerted
about possible violations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit was filed in 2010 after talks between GEMA and
Google on license fees for songs played on YouTube faltered.
GEMA collects royalties for composers and songwriters. An
earlier agreement between the two sides expired in 2009. Google
has reached licensing agreements with about 40 collecting
societies from other nations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Google maintained that that it provides enough
mechanisms for rights holders to detect violations, GEMA sought
a ruling expanding YouTube&#8217;s obligations to any illegal upload
in the past. The court ruled that YouTube&#8217;s must add a word
search to help detect videos. The current &#8220;ContentID&#8221;
application, which allows searches for audio content, isn&#8217;t
enough, according to the judges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a good ruling for us as YouTube must react once
it is alerted,&#8221; said Kerstin Baecker, GEMA&#8217;s lawyer. &#8220;So far
they have said they don&#8217;t have to do anything.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google spokesman Kay Oberbeck said the ruling provides
legal certainty and is important &#8220;for artists, musicians and
fans.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both sides said they will decide whether to appeal the part
of the ruling they lost after studying the written judgment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is LG Hamburg, 310 O 461/10. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cafe Drops Trade Secret Suit Over Recipe for &#8216;Cinnamon Bombs&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proprietor of a bakery cafe in Evanston, Illinois, has
dropped a suit against a former employee she accused of stealing
her recipe, the Chicago Tribune reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Susan Davis Friedman of the Fraiche Bakery Cafe settled the
dispute with former employee Maryann Huppert over the recipe for
Cinnamon Bombs, a donut-like muffin that had become the bakery&#8217;s
signature offering, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huppert had said she brought the recipe from home, that it
originated in a cookbook and that it never was the restaurant&#8217;s
property, the Tribune reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedman was represented in the dispute by her husband
Benson Friedman, who told the newspaper that while the recipe
initially may have come from a book, his wife altered it and
made it her own, according to the Tribune. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest
drug maker, is near an agreement to sell its infant-nutrition
business to Nestle SA (NESN) for about $11 billion, said people with
knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An announcement may come as soon as today, said the people,
who declined to be identified because the matter is private.
Nestle was chosen on April 22 over Danone SA (BN), which also bid
about $11 billion, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchase will help Nestle, already the top seller of
infant-nutrition products, regain traction in the Chinese baby-
food market where Pfizer has a 7 percent share. Nestle has been
losing market share in the country since 2005, when it withdrew
two varieties of Neslac milk powder because authorities found
they contained excessive iodine. China accounted for about 23
percent of the 30.9 billion euro ($41 billion) market for baby-
food products in 2011, according to Euromonitor International. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale would be Pfizer&#8217;s largest divestiture since the
$16.6 billion sale of consumer health brands including Sudafed
cold medicine and Bengay pain cream to Johnson  Johnson in
2006. It is the first of two major exits that Pfizer Chief
Executive Officer Ian Read outlined to shrink the New York-based
company and concentrate its efforts on producing new drugs.
Pfizer was close to choosing between Nestle and Danone, people
knowledge of the deal said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This deal makes huge strategic sense for Nestle,&#8221; Andrew Wood, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, wrote April 18 in a
note to clients. &#8220;It is in the right categories and the right
markets and with a reasonable price we would expect a fairly
positive reaction from investors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Infant Nutrition Benefits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has &#8220;no comments at this time,&#8221; said Trupti Wagh,
a Singapore-based spokeswoman for the company. Two calls made
outside of business hours to Nestle&#8217;s corporate media relations
line in Switzerland went unanswered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s business includes infant formulas such as SMA and
Promil. The unit, which also makes Enercal supplements for
adults, offers products in more than 60 countries, according to
its website, and accounted for 3.2 percent of the company&#8217;s 2011
revenue. Pfizer gained the formula division through its $68
billion purchase of Wyeth in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer had the fifth-largest global market share of the
infant formula business in 2010, trailing Nestle, Mead-Johnson
Nutrition Co. (MJN), Danone, and Abbott Laboratories, according to Lee
Linthicum, an analyst with Euromonitor in London. Its market
positions are strongest in the Middle East and Africa, and in
the Asia-Pacific region, where Pfizer&#8217;s unit is the third- and
fourth-largest respectively, Linthicum said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) must face
fraud claims brought by ACA Financial Guaranty Corp. over a
mortgage-based investment that led to a settlement with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACA Financial sued Goldman Sachs in New York State Supreme
Court in January 2011, accusing the company of fraudulent
inducement, fraudulent concealment and unjust enrichment in
connection with a collateralized debt obligation known as
Abacus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Barbara Kapnick threw out the unjust enrichment
claim in an order dated yesterday, saying that the plaintiffs
failed to establish that Goldman Sachs wrongly benefited at ACA
Financial&#8217;s expense. Kapnick let stand two fraud claims in the
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Justice Kapnick vindicated ACA&#8217;s position, and rejected
all of Goldman&#8217;s arguments opposing ACA&#8217;s fraud claims,&#8221; Marc Kasowitz, a lawyer for New York-based ACA, said in an e-mailed
statement. &#8220;Full discovery in this case will now proceed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACA seeks $120 million in compensation and punitive damages
for the fraud claims, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment on yesterday&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs agreed in July 2010 to pay $550 million, the
largest penalty ever assessed by the SEC against a Wall Street
firm, to settle allegations against it involving the Abacus
deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is ACA Financial v. Goldman Sachs  Co.,
650027/2011, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rambus Inc. (RMBS), a memory-chip designer
that gets most of its revenue from royalties, rose the most
since Feb. 8 after an analyst at JPMorgan Chase  Co. raised his
rating on the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rambus climbed 8.4 percent, or 37.5 cents, to $4.85 in New
York, the stock&#8217;s first gain in five days. Paul Coster, an
analyst at JPMorgan, boosted his rating on Rambus to overweight,
the equivalent of a buy, from neutral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After declining 41 percent this year before today, the
company&#8217;s shares are fairly valued and aren&#8217;t likely to decline
further, Coster wrote in a note. Rambus&#8217;s stock slumped after it
lost a legal dispute with Micron Technology Inc. (MU) last year, and
has been dropping since last week, when its second-quarter
earnings forecasts fell short of some estimates, Coster wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunnyvale, California-based Rambus licenses chip designs
and seeks royalties on its ownership of technologies fundamental
to computer memory chips. The company has been involved in legal
disputes with memory chipmakers over the validity of its
ownership of that technology for more than a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rambus stock is down more than 70 percent from its closing
price on Nov. 15, the day before Rambus lost a jury trial in
which it alleged that Micron and Hynix Semiconductor Inc. (000660)
conspired to prevent its memory chips from becoming an industry
standard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Rambus&#8217;s legal costs decline, its earnings will improve,
and it has opportunities to bring in additional revenue by
selling its technology into the mobile-device and LED-lighting
markets, Coster wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The judge presiding over the
prosecution of former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) director Rajat Gupta limited the release of information about a second employee
of the bank passing tips to Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff, in New York, ordered that
none of the material turned over to Gupta&#8217;s lawyers about a
criminal probe of the Goldman Sachs employee can be made public,
and it can only be used to defend Gupta in this case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. notified Rakoff at an April 20 hearing that
federal prosecutors in Los Angeles are investigating the
unidentified Goldman Sachs employee. In January, prosecutors
disclosed that Rajaratnam had another source who passed him
inside information, a Goldman Sachs executive Rakoff dubbed
&#8220;Mr. X.&#8221; The government said those tips weren&#8217;t related to the
crimes Gupta is charged with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All material produced by the prosecutors in Los Angeles
that isn&#8217;t publicly available otherwise is &#8220;restricted
information and will be designated as such upon production by
the government,&#8221; Rakoff said in an order signed yesterday and
made public today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rakoff also said the material must be returned to the
government at the conclusion of the trial. The order was agreed
to by Alan Friedman, one of Gupta&#8217;s lawyers, and Assistant U.S.
Attorney Reed Brodsky, who is prosecuting the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Illegal Tips &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta, a former Goldman Sachs director, is scheduled to go
on trial May 21, accused leaking illegal tips to Rajaratnam
about the bank holding company as well as Procter  Gamble Co. (PG),
where Gupta was also a director. He pleaded not guilty to six
counts of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary Naftalis, Gupta&#8217;s lead lawyer, has sought information
from the government about Rajaratnam&#8217;s sources of illegal tips
from Goldman Sachs. Naftalis, who argues the &#8220;wrong man&#8221; is on
trial, has said there&#8217;s evidence that the &#8220;Goldman Sachs
executive&#8221; was caught on a wiretap leaking information to
Rajaratnam about Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Intel Corp. (INTC) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naftalis didn&#8217;t immediately return a voicemail message left
at his office seeking comment on Rakoff&#8217;s order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naftalis said at the April 20 hearing that he had been told
by Brodsky that prosecutors in Los Angeles were &#8220;conducting an
investigation involving another Goldman Sachs person.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Additional Source&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We obviously would request of the government to get us
any and all information relating to this additional source that
Mr. Raj Rajaratnam had at Goldman Sachs of nonpublic information
as soon as possible,&#8221; Naftalis said at the hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brodsky gave Rakoff a copy of the letter he had sent
Naftalis informing him of the probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such evidence about Goldman tippers may show one of
Rajaratam&#8217;s other sources was the real culprit and not Gupta,
Naftalis has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rakoff at the April 20 hearing pressed prosecutors to
provide the defense with the name of &#8220;Mr. X.&#8221; He also quoted
from a letter Brodsky sent U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte Jr. in
Los Angeles him to provide the Gupta&#8217;s defense team with
documents and other information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Gupta, 11-cr-00907, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first live question
International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) Chief Executive Officer
Virginia &#8220;Ginni&#8221; Rometty faced at today&#8217;s shareholder meeting
was if Georgia&#8217;s Augusta National Golf Club had admitted her as
a member. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is one of the sponsors of the Masters Tournament, held
at Augusta National, where no woman has been offered membership
since its founding eight decades ago. Historically, the club has
offered a membership to the CEO of IBM, allowing him to don the
club&#8217;s green member blazer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m certainly very happy about our CEO and be anxious to
know if she&#8217;s a member of Augusta?&#8221; the unidentified male
shareholder asked at the meeting in North Charleston, South
Carolina. &#8220;No response is required,&#8221; he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rometty, 54, didn&#8217;t answer while the room was filled with
laughter. Chairman Sam Palmisano, standing next to her on the
stage, thanked the shareholder for the &#8220;very kind comment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We were all curious as to when that would come up,&#8221;
Palmisano said. &#8220;But thank you again. Can I have another
question please?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News revived the debate when it reported on March
28 the conflict between Augusta&#8217;s men-only membership policy and
Rometty. The first Masters Tournament after Rometty&#8217;s promotion
to IBM&#8217;s CEO was held earlier this month. The club and Armonk,
New York-based IBM have declined to comment on the issue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Hancock Life Insurance&#8217;s
lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase  Co. over residential mortgage-
backed securities was moved to federal court from New York state
court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Hancock, a unit of Boston-based Manulife Financial
Corp. (MFC), sued New York-based JPMorgan in state Supreme Court in
Manhattan in January, accusing the bank of fraud tied to the
sale of residential mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal courts have jurisdiction because the claims arise
under U.S. law, the case involves international banking or
financial operations, and it is related to bankruptcy
proceedings, according to documents filed by the defendants in
state court today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Hancock bought the securities &#8220;in reliance on the
false and misleading&#8221; statements made by the defendants, which
include Bear Stearns  Co. and Washington Mutual Inc., according
to the complaint. JPMorgan acquired Bear Stearns and WaMu during
the 2008 financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit seeks unspecified damages for market losses and
principal and interest payments, as well as the cancellation of
contracts and recovery of payments for the investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
biggest recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
and the crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the
market for the securities evaporated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is John Hancock Life Insurance Co. v. JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM), 650195/2012, New York State Supreme Court
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors in U.S. Treasuries
reduced expectations that prices of the securities will climb as
the percentage of so-called long positions dropped in a weekly
survey by JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The percent of net longs in the firm&#8217;s all-clients survey
dropped to two percentages points in the week ended yesterday.
The number of outright neutrals was unchanged at 57 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The level of outright shorts rose to 21 percent from 19
percent the previous week. JPMorgan doesn&#8217;t disclose the number
of clients in the survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a reflection of the balanced outlook for rates,&#8221;
said Srini Ramaswamy, a JPMorgan strategist in New York.
&#8220;What&#8217;s keeping rates here or what could push rates lower is
the risk of the crisis in Europe. Except for that risk, rates
should probably be much higher.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on the benchmark 10-year note rose two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.96 percent at 11:24 a.m.
in New York. The yield touched 2.4 percent on March 20, the
highest since October and has dropped for the past five weeks.
After falling to a record 1.67 percent in September, the yield
traded as low as 1.79 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank by assets, named Jeff Urwin chief executive officer of
Asia Pacific, replacing Gaby Abdelnour, who is leaving the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urwin, 56, will add the role to his duties as head of
global investment banking coverage, the New York-based firm said
in a statement today. He will move to Hong Kong from New York in
May and report to Jes Staley, CEO of the investment bank.
Abdelnour told JPMorgan last month he planned to step down this
summer to pursue personal interests, according to a March memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Basing our global head of investment banking in Asia
Pacific further cements our ongoing commitment to the region and
its importance,&#8221; Staley said in the statement. This is the
first time JPMorgan&#8217;s global head of investment banking will be
based in Asia Pacific, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the third-ranked adviser on mergers globally this
year, is second in the Asia-Pacific region after Morgan Stanley,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The firm has advised on
$24.1 billion of deals in the region this year, including Hong
Kong-based Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.&#8217;s 1.3 billion-euro ($1.7
billion) purchase of Orange Austria in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abdelnour was tapped to run the firm&#8217;s Asia-Pacific unit in
July 2006. Under his leadership, JPMorgan set up a securities
joint venture in China, bought a stake in a trust and a
guarantee company, and established a locally incorporated bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urwin joined JPMorgan from Bear Stearns Cos. in 2008, where
he was co-head of global investment banking. He also worked at
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) increased its
quarterly distribution to shareholders by 21 percent as oil
prices remain above $100 a barrel, making the energy company the
world&#8217;s biggest dividend payer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, boosted its quarterly
dividend to 57 cents a share from 47 cents, according to a
statement yesterday. That means the company will pay $10.7
billion a year to shareholders, more than any other corporation,
according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at
Standard  Poor&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson told analysts
at a meeting last month the company would listen to shareholders
as it evaluated the payout. The company now is set to pay an
annual dividend of $2.28 a share for a yield of 2.6 percent,
less than Chevron Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s 3.5 percent. Brent crude prices, a
benchmark in much of the world, climbed 12 percent in the first
quarter from a year earlier to average $118.45. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s annual spending on dividends is set to surpass such
companies as ATT Inc. (T), Apple Inc. (AAPL) and General Electric Co. (GE),
according to Silverblatt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think they&#8217;re realizing that we&#8217;re in a higher oil-
price environment going forward,&#8221; said Brian Youngberg, an
analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis who has a &#8220;hold&#8221; rating
on Exxon shares and doesn&#8217;t own any. &#8220;The feedback they&#8217;ve been
getting is that the company needs to have a more competitive
dividend yield to attract more investors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron raised its quarterly dividend 11 percent to 90
cents a share from 81 cents, according to a statement yesterday.
That gives Chevron a potential annual dividend of $3.60 a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Youngberg said Exxon has relied on stock buybacks to boost
shareholder value, while he&#8217;d like to see the company raise the
dividend further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Dividends allow the investor to decide how to reinvest
the cash,&#8221; he said in an interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon rose 0.6 percent to $86.85 at the close yesterday in
New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An experimental drug for depression
being developed by Pfizer Inc. (PFE) reduced signs of autism in mice
in a study, a finding that may shed light on the cause of the
disorder and jump-start research into ways to treat it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treatment, named GRN-529, targets the brain chemical
glutamate, tied to socialization and behavior. When given to
mice displaying signs of autism, it suppressed repetitive
actions and anti-social behavior, according to the research
published today in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Pfizer and the National Institutes of Health funded the study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no drugs on the market to treat the symptoms or
causes of autism. Until recently, scientists believed the brains
of autistic patients were hard-wired before diagnosis, making
treatment with a drug difficult, said Daniel Smith, an autism
researcher at Pfizer. That changed with findings the disorder
may be caused by malfunctioning genes that have a real-time
effect on the brain, said Smith, a co-author of the study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is only in the past five years that there have been
large human studies identifying the genetic mutations linked to
autism,&#8221; Smith said in a telephone interview. &#8220;From that we
can now explore those genetic pathways in more detail.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares rose 1.5 percent to $22.96 in New York time.
The stock has gained 14 percent in the past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latest research, mice that were given the Pfizer
drug displayed less repetitive grooming and jumping, and spent
more time interacting with other animals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autism, a disorder that may affect one in 88 U.S. children,
hurts brain development and is linked to poor social interaction
and communication skills, repeated body movements, and unusual
attachments to objects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, based in New York, plans to continue studying the
drug in animals, Smith said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novartis AG and Roche Holding AG (ROG), both based in Basel,
Switzerland, and the closely held U.S. company Seaside
Therapeutics LLC are testing similar medicines in humans with
fragile X syndrome, a genetic condition characterized by mental
retardation, behavior problems, and delayed speech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 30 percent of patients with fragile X meet the
diagnostics criteria for autism, the study said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I tend to be a little more positive than what I&#8217;m hearing
from other people,&#8221; Blankfein, 57, told Bloomberg Television
today in an interview at the investment bank&#8217;s New York
headquarters. &#8220;One of the big risks that people have to
contemplate is that things go right.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, chairman and CEO since June 2006, warned about
the potential for a credit crisis during a June 2007 conference,
15 months before the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
In November, he said he expected markets to &#8220;snap back.&#8221; The
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index rose 12 percent in the first three
months of this year, the most since the third quarter of 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While profit at Goldman Sachs improved from the end of
2011, the fifth-biggest bank by assets reported last week that
first-quarter net income fell 23 percent from a year earlier as
revenue from trading bonds, currencies and commodities lagged
behind rivals JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Citigroup Inc. (C) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein said his bank&#8217;s 12.2 percent return on equity in
the first quarter was a reflection of muted economic growth and
client demand, which he called a &#8220;lower third-quartile
opportunity set.&#8221; He said that investors shouldn&#8217;t extrapolate
the firm&#8217;s long-term prospects from those results. &lt;/p&gt;

the firm&#8217;s long-term prospects from those results. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and
Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. (MMI) keep trying to prove who
violated each other&#8217;s patents, the companies may be motivated to
prevent a possible ban on imports of Xboxes and IPhones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, in the wake of a
preliminary finding yesterday that it infringed one of four
Motorola Mobility smartphone patents, said the company would
&#8220;highly prefer to settle versus battle&#8221; over patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cook&#8217;s comments follow remarks by Google Inc. (GOOG) CEO Larry Page, who called the spate of litigation over smartphones a
&#8220;sad thing&#8221; in a Bloomberg Businessweek interview published
April 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s getting to the point where it is now seriously in
the way of business,&#8221; Victor Siber, former chief intellectual
property counsel for International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) who&#8217;s
now with Baker  Hostetler LLP, said today. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think
these companies are run by their lawyers. The CEOs will
eventually say, enough of this.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits have spread across four continents as companies
vie for a greater share of a market for smartphones that
researcher Gartner Inc. said rose 47 percent in the fourth
quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total market for mobile devices, which includes tablet
computers and e-readers, is projected to reach $360 billion this
year, said Carl Howe, an analyst with Yankee Group, a Boston-
based advisory firm. Consumers spend about $1.05 trillion a year
on related costs including monthly phone bills on their devices,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;A Big Deal&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When we say this is a big deal, that this is revolution
in the making, it really is,&#8221; Howe said. &#8220;It&#8217;s 2 percent of
the global economy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A U.S. International Trade Commission judge said Apple
products including the iPad and iPhone infringe a Motorola
Mobility patent, while another said the Xbox infringed four
patents. Both determinations announced this week are subject to
review by the six-member commission, which can block the Asia-
made products from entering the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A victory at the trade agency may give Motorola Mobility --
and its planned purchaser Google -- leverage in ending lawsuits,
as Apple and Microsoft can&#8217;t afford to stop selling the Xbox,
iPhone and iPad. Apple is appealing a loss in an ITC case it
filed against Motorola Mobility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At the end of the day, companies that have a lot of money
are going to be reapportioning who has how much,&#8221; said David Long, a patent lawyer with Dow Lohnes in Washington who
specializes in telecommunications inventions. &#8220;The question is
how they get there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Jobs Vow &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple filed the first large-scale patent case over
smartphone technology in March 2010 with a case against HTC
Corp. (2498) The legal fights have expanded to include smartphones and
tablets using Google&#8217;s Android operating system, Apple&#8217;s
products and Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox video-gaming system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple&#8217;s first strike reflected a pledge by the late Steve Jobs, as told in his authorized biography last year, that he
would &#8220;spend every penny&#8221; of the company&#8217;s cash to prove that
Android&#8217;s features were copied from the iPhone and iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the interview with Google&#8217;s Page published this month,
he said the legal wrangling was taking its toll, with &#8220;a lot of
money going to lawyers and things, instead of building great
products for users.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this week&#8217;s rulings, the next step in both cases is
for Microsoft and Apple to petition the commission with
arguments they said will undermine Motorola Mobility&#8217;s case.
Microsoft and Apple have said they will challenge Motorola
Mobility&#8217;s right to seek import bans on the patents, as well as
whether there was infringement and if the patents are valid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More Arguments Pending &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, and Cupertino,
California-based Apple say requests from Motorola Mobility that
they pay 2.25 percent of the consumer price of products that
incorporate standards set by industry groups isn&#8217;t reasonable.
It filed a federal lawsuit accusing Motorola Mobility of
breaching its obligation to license its patents on fair terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A judge in Seattle is scheduled to hear arguments on
Microsoft&#8217;s claims on May 7. Apple has its own breach-of-
contract suit against Motorola Mobility pending in federal court
in Madison, Wisconsin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent found to be infringed &#8220;covers industry-standard
technology which Motorola has refused to license to Apple on
reasonable terms,&#8221; Kristin Huguet, a spokeswoman for Apple,
said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it was confident &#8220;the commission will
ultimately rule in Microsoft&#8217;s favor in this case and that
Motorola will be held to its promise to make its standard
essential patents available on fair and reasonable terms.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Opportunity for Settlement&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade agency is reviewing a judge&#8217;s findings that
Motorola Mobility&#8217;s Android phones infringed one Microsoft
patent and not six others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility, based in Libertyville, Illinois, said
that Microsoft didn&#8217;t submit a counteroffer and instead filed a
breach-of-contract suit in federal court in Seattle. It said in
a court filing that Apple &#8220;refuses to negotiate for and will
not accept a license to Motorola&#8217;s declared-essential patents.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legal arguments show that any settlement will take some
time to negotiate, said Edward Weisz of Cozen O&#8217;Connor in New
York, a patent lawyer who specializes in communications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Every other week, some big player is buying up a big
chunk of patents or licensing a big chunk of patents,&#8221; Weisz
said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see it ending it too soon. The products are
still hot, there&#8217;s still a lot of money to be made.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Settlements are inevitable, he said. &#8220;As the big players
become more and more armed with chunks of patents in this area,
and some of these are pioneering patents that go back years,
you&#8217;ll see more opportunity for settlement and cross-
licensing,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case against Apple is In the Matter of Wireless
Communication Devices, Portable Music and Data Processing
Devices, Computers and Components Thereof, 337-745, and the case
against Microsoft is In the Matter of Gaming and Entertainment
Consoles, 337-752, both U.S. International Trade Commission
(Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs International, the
European unit of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), said revenue fell 31
percent to $5.1 billion from $7.4 billion in the year-earlier
period after volatile markets hurt its trading business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income rose to $2.4 billion from $775 million in the
year to 31 December, while administrative expenses were cut to
$2.1 billion from $6.1 billion, according to documents filed at
Companies House in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drop in expenses reflected a credit of $1.8 billion as
the company marked share-based compensation to market prices.
Shares in parent company Goldman Sachs Group, the fifth-biggest
U.S. bank by assets, fell 48 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Institutional Client Services, the trading business, saw
lower net revenue in fixed income, currencies and commodities.
Investment banking revenue was also &#8220;slightly lower&#8221; following
a drop in equity underwriting, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO) said its board voted
to recommend a two-for-one stock split to shareholders and said
the split will be the first in 16 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The split will mark the eleventh in the stock&#8217;s 92-year
history, the Atlanta-based company said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Grant Smith" date="Apr 25, 2012  8:40 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-25/oil-trades-near-one-week-high-goldman-sees-demand-gain.html"><headline>Oil Trades Near One-Week High; Goldman Sees Demand Gain</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Oil rose to its highest level in a
week in New York after the American Petroleum Institute said
crude inventories fell in the U.S., the world&#8217;s biggest consumer
of the commodity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stockpiles decreased by 985,000 barrels last week, the
industry-funded API said. An Energy Department report today is
forecast to show a gain of 2.8 million barrels. Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. said crude prices will rise as demand growth outpaces
production capacity and that increased output by Saudi Arabia,
the biggest producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, has left the group&#8217;s spare capacity at less than 1
million barrels a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There might be some speculative buying ahead of the
Energy Department numbers,&#8221; said Eugen Weinberg, head of
commodities research at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt, who last
month correctly predicted prices had peaked in the short term.
&#8220;U.S. demand remains weak before the driving season, and
inventories high, so in the absence of the geopolitical issues,
markets would justify lower prices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude for June delivery advanced as much as 94 cents, or
0.9 percent, to $104.49 a barrel in electronic trading on the
New York Mercantile Exchange. That&#8217;s the highest since April 18.
The contract was at $104.31 at 1:32 p.m. London time. Prices are
up 5.4 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent oil for June settlement gained as much as $1.09 to
$119.25 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. The European benchmark contract was at a premium of
$14.70 to U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude, little changed
from yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Downward Trend &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil&#8217;s advance in New York may stall as futures remain in a
technical downward trend, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. On the daily chart, the top of a downward-sloping
channel extending back about two months is $104.38 a barrel
today and represents technical resistance, where sell orders
tend to be clustered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasoline stockpiles decreased 3.64 million barrels and
distillate-fuel inventories dropped 3.56 million barrels, the
API&#8217;s weekly report showed. Today&#8217;s Energy Department data may
show a 1.5 million-barrel decline in gasoline supplies,
according to the median of 11 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey of analysts. Distillates are predicted to gain 500,000
barrels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government requires that reports be filed with the
Energy Department for its weekly survey. The API collects
information on a voluntary basis from operators of refineries,
bulk terminals and pipelines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goldman View &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil prices will rise as demand is expanding faster than
production capacity even as the global economy slows, Goldman
Sachs (GS) said in a report e-mailed today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is only a matter of time before inventories and OPEC
spare capacity become effectively exhausted, requiring higher
oil prices to restrain demand,&#8221; said Jeffrey Currie, head of
commodities research at Goldman Sachs in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank reiterated a recommendation to buy September
futures for West Texas Intermediate oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Energy Agency said on April 12 in its
most recent monthly Oil Market Report that OPEC&#8217;s &#8220;effective&#8221;
spare capacity declined to an estimated 2.54 million barrels a
day in March from 2.75 million the previous month. That figure
excludes Iraq, Nigeria, Libya and Iran, said the IEA, an adviser
to the world&#8217;s biggest industrialized nations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gasoline Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. gasoline prices at the pump fell below year-earlier
levels for the first time since at least October 2009, according
to data from AAA, the largest U.S. motoring club. The national
average price for regular gasoline slid 0.9 cent on April 23 to
$3.849 a gallon, according to Heathrow, Florida-based AAA.
That&#8217;s down from $3.86 a year earlier and the lowest level since
March 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand for the motor fuel was little changed last week and
lower than consumption a year earlier, according to MasterCard
Inc. Drivers bought 60.81 million barrels of gasoline in the
week ended April 20, versus 60.8 million the week before,
MasterCard&#8217;s SpendingPulse report showed. That was 6.1 percent
below the year-earlier level, the 34th straight decline in that
measure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arabian Gulf Oil Co., Libya&#8217;s largest crude producer,
warned that it may have to cease production because of protests,
according to the state-run Libya News Agency. Arabian Gulf, or
Agoco, will have to shut its oil fields if protesters blocking
the entrance to its offices in Benghazi do not disperse, Jalil
Mayouf, a company spokesman, was quoted by Libya News as saying.
He didn&#8217;t explain why fields hundreds of miles away from the
office would be shut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The demonstrators are demanding jobs for unemployed young
people and greater transparency on government spending. Agoco
said last month that it expected to reach full capacity of
425,000 barrels a day by the end of April, or about 25 percent
of Libya&#8217;s pre-war output of 1.6 million barrels a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Lynn Doan" date="Apr 25, 2012  7:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-25/freepoint-commodities-to-buy-jpmorgan-s-metal-concentrates-unit.html"><headline>Freepoint Commodities to Buy JPMorgan&#8217;s Metal-Concentrates Unit</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Freepoint Commodities LLC, founded
last year by three former RBS Sempra Commodities LLP executives,
agreed to buy JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s metal-concentrates trading
arm, marking the company&#8217;s first foray into the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The energy-trading company based in Greenwich, Connecticut,
signed an agreement to buy J.P. Morgan Metals  Concentrates LLC,
which trades concentrates and copper cathodes. The terms are
confidential, David Messer, Freepoint&#8217;s chief executive officer,
said in a phone interview from Stamford, Connecticut yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global metals demand is rising as China, the world&#8217;s
largest user, builds more infrastructure, housing and consumer
appliances. The LMEX Index (LMEX), which tracks six base metals traded
on the London Metal Exchange, has risen 5.5 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The J.P. Morgan Metals traders, based in Stamford and China,
including Hong Kong, will become Freepoint&#8217;s first in metals and
will probably be its first in Asia, where it&#8217;s looking to tap
into the growing demand for raw materials, Messer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messer said that the acquisition is a &#8220;reunion&#8221; because
he worked with the team of about 25 traders from the time Sempra
bought the unit in 2002 until he resigned as RBS Sempra&#8217;s chief
executive officer in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Concentrates is a business we&#8217;re very familiar with since
we worked with them for almost a decade,&#8221; Messer said.
&#8220;Historically, the unit was considered one of the top three
players in the concentrates market, and I expect it to grow in
stature over time now that its future is determined.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for JPMorgan in London,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Asian plans &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freepoint has expanded operations in Europe, entered U.S.
power and natural-gas markets in June and said earlier this year
that it was planning to establish offices in Asia to trade
metals, oil and refined-petroleum products and coal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is in the process of acquiring businesses in
Singapore, Dan Hecht, Freepoint&#8217;s general counsel, said in a
telephone interview yesterday from Greenwich, Connecticut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the acquisition of J.P. Morgan Metals receives
regulatory approvals and is complete, the name of the company
will change to Freepoint Metals  Concentrates LLC, Hecht said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glencore International Plc (GLEN) and Trafigura AG are also major
players in the concentrates market, Messer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Laurence Arnold" date="Apr 26, 2012  4:51 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-26/george-doty-who-guarded-goldman-sachs-purse-dies-at-94.html"><headline>George Doty, Who Guarded Goldman Sachs Purse, Dies at 94</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;George Doty, an accountant by
training who helped establish Goldman, Sachs  Co.&#8217;s rigorous
rules on finances and conduct as partner in charge of
administration for two decades until 1984, has died. He was 94. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He died on April 24 at his home in Rye, New York, following
a long illness, according to a death notice released today by
Graham Funeral Home in Rye. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As overseer of the firm&#8217;s purse strings, Doty handled
financial matters of all sizes, ranging from the requisite
capital contributions by new partners to expenditures on office
furniture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Facetiously, we used to call him the &#8216;no&#8217; partner, and
the rest of us probably were &#8216;yes&#8217; partners,&#8221; John C. Whitehead, 90, whose 37-year tenure at Goldman Sachs culminated
in eight years as co-head of the firm, said today in an
interview. &#8220;George was the cautionary voice: &#8216;Have you thought
of this? Have you thought of that? What if such-and-such
happens?&#8217; He was a go-slow, be-careful partner, very valuable in
helping make the firm&#8217;s decisions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside Wall Street, Doty, who was Catholic, was known as a
major philanthropist, particularly to religious causes and
institutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Supporting Catholic Groups &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He and his wife of 63 years, Marie, who died in 2008,
&#8220;have been especially good to Catholic concerns for alleviating
poverty, strengthening higher education and supporting family
life,&#8221; the Catholic Near East Welfare Association, a papal
agency that promotes Christian unity and provides humanitarian
assistance, said today in a blog posting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Fordham University, the Jesuit institution from which he
graduated in 1938, he was &#8220;the man who has given more
consistently than anyone in the university&#8217;s history,&#8221;
according to a 2010 article on the school&#8217;s website. He was a
former trustee at the New York-based institution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doty&#8217;s path to Wall Street came through being a partner at
Lybrand, Ross Brothers  Montgomery, the accounting firm that is
now part of PricewaterhouseCoopers. New York-based Goldman Sachs (GS)
was one of Doty&#8217;s client accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also knew Whitehead from weekly meetings of their Naval
Reserve unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We had been having long talks about how to build up a
truly great professional firm,&#8221; Doty told Charles D. Ellis for
&#8220;The Partnership,&#8221; his 2008 book on the firm. &#8220;We got along
well and I felt he really had something going at Goldman
Sachs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is now the fifth-biggest U.S. bank
by assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;All About Control&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Goldman, &#8220;Doty was all about control, and for him
financial control came first,&#8221; Ellis wrote. &#8220;Expenses were
watched closely. All partners&#8217; tax returns were either done
through the firm or turned in promptly for careful review by the
firm.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an experienced auditor, Doty was on alert for any
corner-cutting or cheating and &#8220;knew that the best way to
prevent big trouble is to be persistently diligent on small
troubles,&#8221; Ellis wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the late 1970s, Doty managed the firm&#8217;s relocation from
55 Broad Street. After mulling sites elsewhere in Manhattan, he
and his colleagues decided to stay close to Wall Street and
build at 85 Broad, which would be the firm&#8217;s famously unflashy
home for three decades until 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Everyone&#8217;s an Equal&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Doty, function easily trumped form. &#8220;When we set up
an enormous trading room, we deliberately built it on one floor
and had only one men&#8217;s room,&#8221; he told Ellis. &#8220;Standing side by
side at urinals, everyone&#8217;s an equal.&#8221; He said he&#8217;d walk to the
restroom slowly, &#8220;so it was easy to follow me&#8221; if you had a
concern or suspicion to pass along. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William D. Cohan, in &#8220;Money and Power: How Goldman Sachs
Came to Rule the World,&#8221; said Doty served as a counterbalance
to the &#8220;risk-taking tendencies&#8221; of Gustave &#8220;Gus&#8221; Levy, who
ran the firm&#8217;s trading department before becoming senior partner
in 1969. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doty told Cohan that Sidney Weinberg, the senior partner,
and Walter Sachs, another partner, &#8220;used to be scared of Gus
for taking them over the cliff because he was a better risk
taker in the markets than they really had the stomach for. I was
brought in at least partly as the counterbalance and to try and
prevent us from getting too exposed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Starting a Career &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George Espy Doty Sr. was born on Feb. 15, 1918, in
Manhattan, the fourth of six children of George E. Doty, a
doctor, and the former Lillian Bergen, according to the death
notice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He graduated from the private Collegiate School in
Manhattan in 1934 and earned an undergraduate degree in 1938
from Fordham and a master&#8217;s degree from Columbia University in
1939. He worked at Price Waterhouse and General Motors Corp.
before enlisting in the U.S. Navy in World War II. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He worked for 17 years at Lybrand, reaching senior partner,
before joining Goldman Sachs in November 1964. He retired in
1984, becoming a limited partner. He is listed as one of 27
&#8220;senior directors&#8221; of the firm -- former employees who may be
called on as advisers in their fields of expertise -- in the
latest annual report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was a founding member and former chairman of the
American Federation for Aging Research, which funds and supports
work in the field of geriatric research and medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doty&#8217;s family has other Goldman ties. His two sons, George
Jr. and William, worked at the firm, and William&#8217;s wife, Jana
Hale Doty, is a retired partner. Elizabeth Doty, a daughter of
George Jr., works in the firm&#8217;s London office, in the
fundamental strategies group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Survivors include his children, Anne Marie Paine of
Fairfield, Connecticut; Barbara Doty of Sag Harbor, New York;
Virginia Doty of New York City; George of New York City; and

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s
largest energy company by market value, said net income fell 11
percent as its biggest first-quarter production decline since
2008 wiped out most of the benefit of record oil prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-quarter profit was $9.45 billion, or $2 a share,
compared with $10.65 billion, or $2.14 a year earlier, the
Irving, Texas-based company said in a statement today. Exxon was
expected to report per-share net income of $2.08, based on the
average of 16 analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson has been
looking for new projects to reverse production declines that
reached 5.5 percent during the first three months of this year,
the third straight quarter of shortfalls, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Lower output was driven by natural field
declines and the impact of higher prices on production-sharing
agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s oil output fell by 7.7 percent during the
quarter while production of U.S. natural gas that is fetching
the lowest prices in a decade rose 0.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The production growth slackening is a concern,&#8221; Allen Good, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. (MORN) in Chicago, said today in a
telephone interview. &#8220;But they should have some projects coming
online in the next couple of years that will add crude
production so hopefully they will reverse some of these
declines.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Production &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production from the Kearl oil-sands project in Canada and
Angolan and Nigerian developments, which are expected to begin
operations this year, are key to meeting the company&#8217;s 2012
volume outlook, David Rosenthal, Exxon&#8217;s vice president of
investor relations, said on a conference call today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon expects full-year volume performance to be consistent
with its March outlook, he said. The company has estimated that
output would fall 3 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales rose 8.8 percent to $124 billion. Exxon fell 0.9
percent to $86.07 at the close in New York. The shares have
risen 1.6 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon became the world&#8217;s biggest dividend payer yesterday
when it boosted its quarterly distribution by 21 percent to 57
cents a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increase brings the company&#8217;s annual payout to
shareholders to $2.28 a share, or $10.7 billion, more than ATT
Inc. (T), Apple Inc. (AAPL) and General Electric Co. (GE), according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at Standard  Poor&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dividend Increase &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The 21 percent increase is obviously very large, but we
think there&#8217;s more to come,&#8221; Jason Gammel, an analyst at
Macquarie Capital Ltd., said today during an interview with
Maryam Nemazee on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;The Pulse.&#8221;
&#8220;Another 20 percent next year is certainly achievable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon plans to purchase about $5 billion of its shares in
the second quarter, unchanged from the first quarter, Rosenthal
said during the call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. gas fell 40 percent during the quarter to an average
of $2.503 per million British thermal units as new wells in
shale formations glutted domestic markets and demand slumped
during a mild winter. The fuel reached a 10-year low of $1.902
on April 19 before rising to $2.068 yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is moving rigs to projects focused on petroleum
liquids, such as the Bakken Shale and Permian Basin, Rosenthal
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon is &#8220;continuing to acquire liquids-rich acreage at
attractive prices and shift our rig fleet over to those areas,
while minimizing the incremental exposure to dry gas wells,&#8221; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent crude futures, the benchmark for two-thirds of the
world&#8217;s oil, averaged $118.45 a barrel, a record for the first
quarter and a 12 percent increase from a year earlier. Exxon&#8217;s
production was 51 percent oil and 49 percent gas last year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) is likely to divest its
animal health unit through a combination of an initial public
offering and an exchange of shares with current stockholders,
Chief Executive Officer Ian Read said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re probably going to exchange, part of it will be sold
for stock in the open market, part of it will be swapped for
Pfizer shares,&#8221; Read said today at the company&#8217;s annual
investor meeting in Morristown, New Jersey. He said that no
final decision has been made on how to shed the business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, is divesting the
animal health unit, with $4.18 billion in revenue last year, as
part of Read&#8217;s plan to focus the New York-based company on
developing new drugs. On April 23, the company announced an
agreement to sell its infant nutrition business to Vevey,
Switzerland-based Nestle SA (NESN) for $11.9 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A public offering of as much as 20 percent of the value of
the animal health business would let Pfizer take cash from the
unit without triggering a large tax penalty, said Erik Gordon, a
business professor at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.
The company could then exchange Pfizer stock for shares in the
new animal health company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reducing Shares &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That reduces the Pfizer share count, and that helps
Pfizer on EPS and dividend coverage,&#8221; Gordon said in an e-mail.
Read has said share buybacks are the first priority for using
the company&#8217;s spare cash. A share exchange would achieve a
similar result in cutting the amount of stock outstanding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer gained less than 1 percent to $23.06 at the close in
New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joan Campion, a spokeswoman for Pfizer, declined to provide
more details on the exact timing of a transaction, only saying
that the company plans to make an announcement this year and
complete any change by July 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer needs new products as it enters an era without
Lipitor, the cholesterol pill that lost patent protection in
2011 after generating $9.58 billion in revenue. The company
doesn&#8217;t have a medicine in its pipeline that will replace all of
Lipitor&#8217;s sales by itself. Instead, Pfizer is trying to fill the
hole with several products, including two under review by U.S.
regulators for possible approval this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with cutting units, Pfizer is shrinking expenses.
Read has said he plans to eliminate another $1 billion from the
company&#8217;s costs this year, focusing on what the drugmaker
describes as selling, informational and administrative costs.
Severance packages for workers who are fired are to be cut in
May, as part of that plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings
on May 1. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s &#8220;Marvel&#8217;s The
Avengers&#8221; broke opening-day records in four overseas markets,
an indication the studio has a hit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The super-hero film featuring Robert Downey Jr. and
Scarlett Johannson opened in 10 markets yesterday. It had record
first-day grosses in New Zealand and Taiwan, and set new marks
for a Disney release in Australia and Italy, the Burbank,
California-based company said today in a statement. &#8220;The
Avengers&#8221; took in a total of $17.1 million internationally,
Disney said. The movie opens May 4 in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney would welcome a hit after announcing last month that
it will take a $200 million write-down on the March science
fiction release &#8220;John Carter.&#8221; Film studio Chairman Rich Ross
resigned on April 20. A successor wasn&#8217;t named. The studio
expects to post a quarterly loss of as much as $120 million as a
result of the flop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign markets represent a growing share of ticket sales
for U.S. studios, according to the Washington-based Motion
Picture Association of America. Worldwide box office sales rose
3.2 percent to $32.6 billion last year, while the U.S. and
Canadian portion fell 3.8 percent to $10.2 billion, the trade
group said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Movietickets.com, which sells tickets in advance for U.S.
theaters, said it is selling more admissions to &#8220;The Avengers&#8221;
than all previous releases from Disney&#8217;s Marvel unit, including
&#8220;Iron Man 2.&#8221; That film grossed $623 million worldwide in
2010, according to Box Office Mojo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, and Mylan Inc. (MYL) said they settled patent-infringement
litigation with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) over a
device used to inject epinephrine during potentially fatal
allergic reactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the confidential settlement, Petach Tikva, Israel-
based Teva, the largest generic-drug maker, may begin selling a
copy of the injector in mid-2015 or earlier, New York-based
Pfizer and Canonsburg, Pennsylvania-based Mylan said in a
statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Teva currently does not have tentative approval from the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#8221; for its product, and sales
are subject to that approval, Pfizer and Mylan said in the
statement. The Teva agreement must also be reviewed by the U.S.
Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate statement today, Antares Pharma Inc. (AIS) of
Ewing, New Jersey, which makes small-needle injector systems,
said that in connection with the settlement, it will supply Teva
with injectors, if needed, for 2013 and 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva was sued over the EpiPen device in federal court in
Delaware in August 2009. The medicine is used for emergency
treatment of reactions to insect bites, food or drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denise Bradley, a Teva spokeswoman, said the company had no
comment on the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is King Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Teva Parenteral
Medicines Inc., 09-CV-652, U.S. District Court, District of
Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

Malik and Matthew Brown" date="Apr 26, 2012  9:02 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-26/natural-gas-to-climb-as-goldman-sees-output-cuts-energy.html"><headline>Natural Gas to Climb as Goldman Sees Output Cuts: Energy</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;U.S. natural gas for delivery this
fall is trading at a record premium, signaling the fuel may be
poised to rebound from its worst quarter in two years because of
production cuts and rising demand from power plants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas futures for delivery in October traded at an all-time
high of 48.1 cents per million British thermal units above the
May contract on April 11, when prices dropped below $2 per
million British thermal units for the first time since 2002. The
spread was 19.7 cents on Jan. 30. Near-month gas may rebound to
$4 &#8220;relatively quickly,&#8221; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in an
April 24 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices have tumbled 31 percent this year as the fourth-
warmest winter on record crimped demand and output from shale
formations increased. Energy companies including ConocoPhillips
and Encana Corp. (ECA) have responded with production cuts, reducing
the chances that supplies will overwhelm storage before winter.
Demand for gas from power plants will climb 16 percent in 2012,
according to the Energy Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re going to see production curtailments and an uptick
in power demand this summer that will prevent us from reaching
maximum storage capacity,&#8221; said Scott Hanold, an analyst at RBC
Capital Markets in Minneapolis. &#8220;Short-term gas contracts can
take a beating, but investors have a more constructive view of
longer-term contracts.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural gas for May delivery increased as much as 6.9 cents
to $2.137 per million British thermal units in electronic
trading today on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and traded at
$2.12 per million Btu at 8:57 a.m. That follows yesterday&#8217;s gain
of 4.7 percent, the biggest since Feb. 16, and brings this
week&#8217;s increase to 10 percent. The spread between May and
October futures was 40.7 cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tumbling Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas is the worst performer this year on the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s GSCI Index of 24 commodities, falling 39 percent on a
total-return basis. Prices on the Nymex dropped 29 percent in
the first quarter, the biggest decline since the first three
months of 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The futures slid to $1.902 per million Btu on April 19, the
lowest price since September 2001. Gas plunged as an inventory
surplus to the five-year average reached 61 percent at the end
of March, the biggest gap in six years. Marketed gas production
will increase 4.5 percent this year to average 69.22 billion
cubic feet a day from an all-time high last year, the Energy
Department estimated April 10 in its Short-Term Energy Outlook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stockpiles totaled 2.512 trillion cubic feet in the week
ended April 13, a record for that time of year, department data
show. Barclays Plc and Bank of America Corp. predicted that
inventory levels would approach or exceed 4.103 trillion cubic
feet, the department&#8217;s estimate for physical storage capacity,
by the end of October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Output Cuts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That outcome is less likely now that prices at 10-year lows
have prompted energy companies to scale back production,
according to Hanold, who was third among gas-price forecasters
ranked by Bloomberg in the eight quarters ended March 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ConocoPhillips (COP) said April 23 that first-quarter output of
oil and gas fell 3.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encana, Canada&#8217;s biggest natural-gas producer by volume,
plans to reduce production by 600 million cubic feet a day,
according to the Calgary-based company&#8217;s first-quarter earnings
statement yesterday. The number of rigs drilling for gas has
tumbled 22 percent this year, data from Baker Hughes Inc. in
Houston show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a current weakness in market fundamentals due to
an oversupply of natural gas and it is clear that a continued
reduction of drilling activity will be required to restore
market balance,&#8221; Encana said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Price Rebound &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural gas may rebound as production growth slows and
colder weather returns later in the year, Goldman Sachs said in
its report this week. The 2011-2012 winter was the warmest since
2000 in the contiguous U.S., according to the National Climatic
Data Center in Asheville, North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 51 percent of U.S. households use gas for heating,
Energy Department data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas may drop below $1.80 if hot summer weather fails to
materialize, Laurent Key, a gas analyst at Societe Generale SA
in New York, said in an April 24 telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possibility of an El Nino, a warming of the mid-Pacific
Ocean, has forecasters predicting lower temperatures across the
U.S. this summer, which may mean less electricity will be needed
to run air conditioners, according to Weather Services
International in Andover, Massachusetts. About 35 percent of
U.S. gas demand comes from power producers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The El Nino pattern may also cause a below-average Atlantic
storm season, with four hurricanes expected this year compared
with 19 last year, according to researchers at Colorado State
University who pioneered long-range Atlantic forecasting. About
6.4 percent of U.S. gas production comes from the Gulf of
Mexico, where storms can disrupt supplies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Power Plants &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Falling gas prices are compelling power-plant operators to
switch from burning higher-priced coal, Sabine Schels, head of
fundamental commodities research at Bank of America in London,
said in a telephone interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas costs for power plants slid to the equivalent of
$1.3783 per million Btu less than coal on April 19, the biggest
discount since coal futures began trading in 2001, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Electric Power Co., the biggest U.S. producer of
coal-fueled electricity, said April 20 that it used 62 percent
more gas in the first quarter than a year earlier because of low
prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Southern Co. (SO), once the largest U.S. consumer of coal,
expects to generate 57 percent of its power from natural gas by
2020 if low prices and new environmental rules remain in effect,
Thomas Fanning, Southern&#8217;s chairman and chief executive officer,
said during an interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Normal Winter &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Slower production growth combined with a return to more
normal winter weather next year will reduce the amount of price-
induced coal-to-gas substitution required,&#8221; Jeffrey Currie, a
New York-based analyst at Goldman, said in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas prices will recover next year as normal winter weather,
lower output growth and increasing demand bring storage back to
usual levels by October 2013, according to Schels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are close to a bottom, but equally we think any price
recovery from there will be very long, drawn out and gradual,&#8221;
Schels said. &#8220;We&#8217;re generating a humongous amount of coal-to-
gas switching. You don&#8217;t need prices to go lower to generate
more switching, unless coal prices drop.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s real is too strong and

at the Bloomberg Latin America Investing Conference in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
fifth-largest U.S. bank, expanded its management team for Brazil
investment banking, naming Daniel Wainstein chairman and adding
two co-chief operating officers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antonio Pereira and Fabio Bicudo, previously managing
directors at the New York-based company, were named co-COOs and
Wainstein, 42, who was head of the Brazil investment bank, will
become chairman effective immediately, Stephen Scherr, Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s chief for Latin America and global head of the
investment bank&#8217;s financing group, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have been expanding the team, and we need Daniel to
have more client engagement,&#8221; Scherr said, adding that Goldman
Sachs has doubled the number of employees as revenue increased
from the business in the past three years. Goldman Sachs has
about 300 people in Brazil, Scherr said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pereira and Bicudo &#8220;will assist Daniel in the day-to-day
management tasks,&#8221; freeing him up to develop client
relationships, Scherr said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm, which doesn&#8217;t disclose Brazil revenue or profit,
last month named Paulo Leme as chairman for the country. The
firm has said its strategy in Brazil is to focus on complex
products with higher profit margins, such as convertible debt
and receivables securitization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. and international banks are competing against Brazil-
based companies such as Banco Itau BBA SA and Banco BTG Pactual
SA, which have used their stronger local contacts to squeeze out
foreign firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Merger Advisers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t make the top 10 in any Brazil
investment-banking category in 2009 or 2010, excluding
international bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The firm was No. 8 among Brazil merger advisers last year, with
$14.8 billion in deals, and ranks 10th this year for MA, with
two deals totaling $2.62 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs completed its strategy to become a full-
service bank in Brazil in 2009, after two failed attempts to buy
local firms. In 1998, Goldman Sachs tried to buy Banco de
Investimentos Garantia SA, which was acquired by Credit Suisse
Group AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven years later it sought to purchase Banco Pactual SA,
an investment bank later acquired by UBS AG. Pactual was sold
back to BTG Partners in 2009 and is now Banco BTG Pactual SA.
BTG went public this week in a $1.94 billion initial offering
that Goldman Sachs helped underwrite. &lt;/p&gt;

with the downside of higher oil prices: a decline in output as
some project contracts reduce the company&#8217;s share of production
when global crude rises. The company said the higher price it
receives for oil more than makes up for the decrease in its
share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron gains $40 of earnings for every dollar lost to
price effects, Jeanette Ourada, general manager of investor
relations, said on a conference call with analysts today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural-gas output also declined in the U.S. as the lowest
prices in a decade discouraged drilling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gas Production Curtailments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are seeing the mothballing of some conventional
natural-gas production at these low price levels,&#8221; said Robbert Van Batenburg, head of research at Louis Capital Markets LP in
New York. &#8220;They can&#8217;t really fight that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron pumped the equivalent of 2.63 million barrels of
crude a day during the quarter, a 4.7 percent drop from 2.76
million produced a year earlier, according to the statement.
Sales rose 0.8 percent to $58.9 billion, 7.8 percent less than
the average of three analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron fell 2 cents to $106.20 at the close in New York.
The shares have dropped 0.2 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. gas output dropped by 7.9 percent to 1.17 billion
cubic feet a day. Crude production in the U.S. declined by 5.4
percent and fell by 6.3 percent internationally, the company
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent crude futures, which serve as the benchmark for two-
thirds of the world&#8217;s crude, jumped 12 percent to average
$118.45 a barrel during the quarter. Every $1 increase in the
price of oil reduces the company&#8217;s production volume by 1,000
barrels a day, Watson told analysts and investors in New York on
March 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Neutral Effect &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earnings will have a neutral effect on Chevron&#8217;s stock,
Barclay&#8217;s analyst Paul Cheng wrote in a note to clients. The
market will focus on stronger-than-expected results in its
exploration and production segment, Cheng wrote in the note,
pointing to the company&#8217;s higher per-barrel profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron saw profit equivalent to $25.80 per barrel, Cheng
said, up from $24.10 in the year-earlier period and above
Barclay&#8217;s estimate of $25.30. Cheng rates Chevron&#8217;s stock as
overweight, which means investors should buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron said on April 10 that it recorded a $200 million
gain during the quarter from the sale of Spanish assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) reported $9.45 billion in first-quarter
profit yesterday, an 11 percent decline from a year earlier. The
Irving, Texas-based company is the largest U.S. energy producer
by market value. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J. Michael Evans, vice chairman at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), who oversees the firm&#8217;s business in
emerging markets, last night paid $22,000 for Eric Ripert to
cook in his home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Children&#8217;s Storefront auction, he also bid a winning
$13,000 for brunch at the Red Rooster, honoree Marcus Samuelsson&#8217;s restaurant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The Ripert price was a comparative bargain: at an April 24
benefit, an unidentified member of the City Harvest board had
paid $200,000 for the same privilege.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a week when Goldman Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein told CNBC that the board has a successor in mind and
hasn&#8217;t told that person yet, Evans, sometimes named as a leading
candidate for the job, asserted himself on behalf of two New
York charities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At his side was his tall blonde Norwegian wife, Lise Evans,
one night wearing St. John, the other Lanvin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lanvin, a pink and red cocktail dress, came out for &#8220;A
Night for Changing Lives,&#8221; the Children&#8217;s Storefront benefit at
the IAC Building, where Michael, 54, and Lise, 44, were event
chairmen (and Michael wore a business suit and a tie with a
whale pattern). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tuition-free independent school, located in four
brownstones on East 129th Street in Harlem, teaches 174 students
in pre-kindergarten through the eighth grade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Education Master &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lise first served the school as a student teacher while
earning a master&#8217;s degree in English education at Columbia
University&#8217;s Teachers College. A board member for seven years,
she will be installed as board chairwoman in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two days earlier Michael and Lise were co-chairmen with
seven other couples, including Heather and Steve Mnuchin, of
&#8220;An Evening of Practical Magic,&#8221; the City Harvest benefit at
Cipriani 42nd Street. There the couple sat with Credit Suisse&#8217;s
Bob Jain, Goldman colleague Henry Cornell, the writer Jay McInerney and Ripert, chef at Le Bernardin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael joined the board of City Harvest last year, having
learned about it from Ripert, a City Harvest board member, at
whose restaurant he is a frequent customer. One of his favorite
dishes is the thinly pounded yellow fin tuna served with foie
gras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Not too much, not too little, light and beautiful,&#8221;
Michael said of the dish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was not a question of convincing or recruiting Michael
to the board,&#8221; Ripert said. &#8220;He wanted to do it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stephens Praised &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;City Harvest fits the things that Lise and I are
interested in,&#8221; Michael said, praising the organization&#8217;s
executive director, Jilly Stephens. &#8220;Ask yourself this: Who
writes anything negative about City Harvest? It&#8217;s one of the
most efficient ecosystems for the redistribution of food.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Olympic gold medalist for the Canadian rowing team in
1984, Michael has been described by his former Princeton
University teammate John Seabrook as &#8220;super, super
competitive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said he still rows a single on occasion in Southampton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lise, for her part, grew up a skier. Now she likes to kick
box. Her goal as chairwoman, she said, is to expand
collaborations with Harlem Children&#8217;s Zone, the Studio Museum in
Harlem and other institutions in the neighborhood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Richter, Kennedy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also this week: Jim Berk, CEO of Participant Media, joined
the lead singer of Train, Pat Monahan, former New York Ranger
Mike Richter and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to support Riverkeeper.
Susan Sarandon and Padma Lakshmi also attended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berk said the documentary about hunger by chef and Craft
restaurateur Tom Colicchio and filmmaker Lori Silverbush will be
released in early 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sir John Soane&#8217;s Museum in London held a benefit at 583
Park where art dealer Angela Westwater chatted with the Met
Museum Greek and Roman art curator Carlos A. Picon. In the same
venue, Mario Cuomo gave a tribute to his wife, Matilda Cuomo, on
behalf of the SLE Lupus Foundation, which increased the revenue
at its Bag Ladies Luncheon to $250,000 from $183,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venetian Heritage lured its supporters with Tilda Swinton
and Richard Gere. And at the Whitney Museum of American Art,
choreographer Sarah Michelson received the Bucksbaum Award, a
$100,000 grant bestowed on an artist in the biennial, named
after and endowed by Melva Bucksbaum, a museum trustee.
Michelson, the second female to receive the award in 12 years,
will also get her own exhibition at the Whitney. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia must push ahead with plans
to overhaul its financial markets and focus on taming inflation
as it jostles with emerging nations such as Brazil for global
investor cash, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s biggest energy exporter may attract more
investment by meeting a July target to allow foreign funds
access to its local debt market, said Francesco Garzarelli,
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s co-head of macro and markets research. The step
is part of a plan to turn Moscow into a global financial hub. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of money flowing around and it&#8217;s yielding
close to nothing,&#8221; Garzarelli said April 25 in an interview in
Moscow. &#8220;If someone&#8217;s there to sell a credible structural
story, it&#8217;s easy to come up on the map. But it has to be
followed through.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia, which has endured $340 billion in net private
capital outflows since 2007, has merged its two biggest stock
exchanges and is creating a central depositary to help lure
investment. A plan to allow foreign investors to settle ruble
bond trades through Euroclear Bank SA, the world&#8217;s biggest bond-settlement system, from July is in doubt after the Interfax news
service reported a presidential working group voted against the
idea on April 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garzarelli highlighted Brazil&#8217;s success in nurturing a
domestic institutional investor base and improving financial
infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Off The Map &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Russia&#8217;s not entirely on the map here,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;There&#8217;s foreign funding, they&#8217;re trying to develop some of the
domestic markets, but it doesn&#8217;t seem like a story that captures
the non-specialists.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexican five-year domestic bonds with the same credit
rating as ruble debt and available on Euroclear yield 233 basis
points less than similar-dated Russian OFZs. The spread was as
low as 111 basis points in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian local-currency debt has returned 6.7 percent in the
last year, compared with a 20 percent advance for real-denominated Brazilian bonds, according to JPMorgan EMBIG
indexes. The ruble-based Micex (INDEXCF) index is up 4.1 percent in 2012
compared with an 9.6 percent advance for Brazil&#8217;s Bovespa. (IBOV) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s central bank has been a &#8220;key element&#8221; in the
South American nation&#8217;s development as policy makers gained
credibility by controlling price growth, according to
Garzarelli. Annual inflation as measured by the IPCA-15 index
slowed to 5.25 percent in mid-April, the lowest rate since
October 2010. Prices rose 6.5 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inflation Struggle &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After bringing the annual rate of price growth to a post-Soviet low of 3.7 percent in February and March, Russia&#8217;s
central bank may struggle to meet its 2012 inflation target of 5
percent to 6 percent, Chairman Sergey Ignatiev said April 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator says it plans to hold the rate at 4 percent
to 5 percent in 2014, when it will complete a transition to
inflation targeting instead of focusing on the exchange rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slower inflation has helped Russian debt offer positive
real interest rates. Still, that alone may not be enough to
tempt investors away from other nations, Garzarelli said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You probably need to see market infrastructure develop in
addition to the enticement of the yield,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You&#8217;re
basically asking people to redefine their emerging-market
allocation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-- JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) said a Federal
Reserve proposal to cut risk by capping a bank&#8217;s dealings with
any one lender, corporation or foreign government fails to
strike the &#8220;correct balance&#8221; and may harm financial markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan &#8220;could destabilize markets,&#8221; Barry Zubrow,
executive vice president of corporate and regulatory affairs for
JPMorgan, said yesterday in a comment letter to the central
bank. The Fed is reaching &#8220;well beyond&#8221; the Dodd-Frank reform
legislation with &#8220;disruptive&#8221; standards that duplicate or
conflict with other rules and directives, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders including New York-based JPMorgan, the largest and
most profitable U.S. bank, are resisting Fed efforts to impose
tougher standards on too-big-to-fail firms whose collapse could
hurt the broader economy. Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo will meet
tomorrow with chief executive officers of the biggest banks
including JPMorgan&#8217;s Jamie Dimon to discuss the limits and
complaints about this year&#8217;s stress tests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal to limit credit exposure is designed to
contain the damage if a large company, foreign government or
bank should fail and threaten to take down other institutions
with it. Under the rule, a firm deemed systemically important
couldn&#8217;t have more than 10 percent of its counterparty risk tied
to one entity. The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act proposed a 25 percent cap
while giving the Fed authority to tighten the standard to ensure
stability in financial markets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four New York City Council members
sued the city over the handling of Occupy Wall Street
protesters, claiming the police used excessive force and should
be subject to an outside monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Police Department made false arrests and violated free-speech rights of protesters and journalists last year, according
to a complaint filed today in Manhattan federal court by the
council members and 11 others. JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Brookfield
Office Properties and Mayor Michael Bloomberg are among the
defendants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Occupy movement in New York has held demonstrations and
marches since Nov. 15, when police ousted hundreds of protesters
from Zuccotti Park near Wall Street, where they had camped since
Sept. 17. Protesters spread an anti-greed message, calling
attention to what they say are abuses of power and wealth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Through unlawful exercises of public power and
misapplication of law, the NYPD has sought to prevent and has
prevented plaintiffs and other citizens from exercising certain
constitutional rights, including the right to public assembly
and expressive speech,&#8221; according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The City Council members are Jumaane Williams, Letitia James, Ydanis Rodriguez and Melissa Mark-Viverito. The council
has 51 members. Bloomberg, the mayor, is the founder and
majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kate Ahlers, a spokeswoman for New York&#8217;s Law Department,
said the city hasn&#8217;t been served with the complaint and will
review it thoroughly. Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for
JPMorgan Chase, declined to comment in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Zuccotti Park &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brookfield owns Zuccotti Park, which is considered a public
space. Melissa Coley, a spokeswoman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occupy Wall Street demonstrators were denied access to One
Chase Manhattan Plaza, which &#8220;has traditionally been used as a
public space for public speech,&#8221; according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Oct. 12, demonstrators sought to give a large symbolic
check to JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon,
representing tax breaks he would get in New York state,
according to the complaint. Police barricades and officers
denied them access to the plaza, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occupy Wall Street demonstrators plan marches around the
globe tomorrow, saying they hope the coordinated events will
mark a spring resurgence of the movement after a quiet winter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Second Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate federal court lawsuit, five demonstrators
today sued city Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly and various
officers for detaining them in an interlocking metal barricade
during a protest on Nov. 30. About 100 people demonstrated in
front of a Sheraton Hotel where President Barack Obama attended
a fundraiser, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs, who asked that the case be certified as
class-action suit, claim protesters couldn&#8217;t leave for almost
two hours and were &#8220;never charged with any violation,
misdemeanor or crime,&#8221; Phoebe Berg and others claimed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The police violated their rights to freedom of speech,
association and assembly, and freedom from unreasonable seizure,
according to the complaint. The group asked for an order barring
the NYPD from the unlawful use of barricades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Rodriguez v. Winski, 12-cv-3389, and Berg v.
Kelly, 12-cv-3391, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

Stanford and Jeffrey McCracken" date="Apr 30, 2012  6:03 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-30/coca-cola-says-it-isn-t-in-talks-to-acquire-monster-beverage.html"><headline>Coca-Cola Denies Discussions to Acquire Monster Beverage</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO) said it isn&#8217;t in
discussions to buy Monster Beverage Corp. (MNST) after the Wall Street
Journal reported the companies were in talks. Monster fell after
posting the biggest intraday gain in almost eight years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monster dropped 0.8 percent to $65 in New York after
climbing as much as 28 percent, its biggest intraday gain since
May 7, 2004. The Corona, California-based company still has
risen 41 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At this time, we are not in discussions to acquire the
Monster Beverage Corporation,&#8221; Atlanta-based Coca-Cola, which
has a distribution deal with Monster, said in a statement today.
&#8220;We continue to review the best ways to maximize the value of
our relationship.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monster shopped itself to Coca-Cola and PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) a year
ago, and both beverage companies passed on an acquisition,
citing the cost of a deal, said a person familiar with the
matter. A few months ago, Coca-Cola and Monster spoke again
about a deal, said the person, who asked not to be named because
the talks were private. Coca-Cola again decided Monster was too
expensive and pressed to start talks about an expanded
partnership that could lead to a small stake sale to Coca-Cola,
said the person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Journal, citing unidentified people familiar with the
situation, reported today that Coca-Cola was in talks to buy
Monster and may sell some of its bottling assets to pay for the
company. Monster trades at more than 30 times estimated 2012
earnings, and Coca-Cola may not want to pay a large premium for
the beverage-maker because the two companies already have a
distribution deal, the Journal reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Monster Distribution &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola already distributes almost half of Monster&#8217;s U.S.
volume. Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI) distributes roughly the same
amount with a few small distributors making up the balance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judy Lin Sfetcu, a spokeswoman for Monster, declined to
comment. Peter Land, a PepsiCo spokesman, declined to comment.
Kent Landers, a spokesman for Coca-Cola, said the company had no
comment beyond the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of the April 27 close, Monster had a market
capitalization of about $11 billion. At that price it would be
Coca-Cola&#8217;s second-biggest deal after its $12.2 billion
acquisition of the North American operations of bottler Coca-
Cola Enterprises Inc. in 2010, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monster, which got its start selling juices in the 1930s,
had the highest operating margins in the industry as of March
and was projected to boost earnings 70 percent in the next three
years, analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg showed. U.S.
alternative-beverage sales reached almost $32 billion last year,
according to estimates by the Beverage Marketing Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Energy Drinks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monster Beverage, formerly known as Hansen Natural Corp.,
sold juices and sodas under the Hansen name before introducing
the first Monster Energy products in 2002 to capture growing
demand for drinks made with added caffeine or supplements to
deliver an energy boost. Monster brands, ranging from coffee-
based Java Monster to its Nitrous drink injected with nitrous
oxide, now account for about 91 percent of sales, according to
the company&#8217;s most recent annual statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monster Beverage&#8217;s revenue climbed an average of 24 percent
in each of the past five years, compared with 15 percent for
Coca-Cola and 14 percent for PepsiCo, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Monster&#8217;s operating margin of 27 percent in 2011
was the highest among publicly traded North American soft-drink
companies with a market value greater than $500 million, the
data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) plans to start
its South Line oil pipeline, which runs from Raceland to

&lt;p&gt;The 16-inch line, which is part of Exxon&#8217;s Southwest

test, Rachael Moore, a company spokeswoman based in Fairfax,
Virginia, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A portion of the Southwest system from South Bend to
Sunset, Louisiana, was shut indefinitely Oct. 31, according to a
bulletin to shippers obtained at the time by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon shut the pipeline after a special permit application
on the segment was rejected by the federal Pipeline and
Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, Patricia Errico, an
Exxon spokeswoman, said in November. &lt;/p&gt;

offering, said a person with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offering will probably occur this year, said the
person, who asked not to be named because the plans aren&#8217;t
public. Ruckus Chief Executive Officer Selina Lo, when asked
about the potential share sale, said the company is exploring
options and is in talks with bankers about a possible IPO. She
declined to elaborate on plans to choose underwriters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We would like to try to go this year,&#8221; she said in a
phone interview. Pen Pendleton, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley,
declined to comment, as did Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Michael DuVally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sunnyvale, California-based company is a leader in the
market for gear that lets phone companies shunt data traffic
from overcrowded cellular networks onto higher-capacity Wi-Fi
networks. Carriers are using Ruckus&#8217;s small networking devices
that can be placed on telephone poles, street lights or roofs to
relieve networks swamped by data traffic from smartphones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruckus had sales of $120 million in 2011, up 50 percent
from the previous year, the company said. This year, Ruckus has
signed deals with Time Warner Cable Inc., Telekom Malaysia Bhd.
and Axtel SAB, Lo said. The company plans to announce a
partnership at the International CTIA Wireless show in New
Orleans on May 7 with equipment maker Nokia Siemens Networks Oy,
which will resell Ruckus&#8217;s gear as part of network deployments,
she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wi-Fi Spectrum &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A lot of service providers weren&#8217;t really spending much
time with us last year, but now they all have requests for
proposals to do large Wi-Fi projects,&#8221; Lo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In London, Lo said she saw Ruckus&#8217;s newest products on a
lamppost on Exhibition Road, as part of plans by Telefonica SA&#8217;s
O2 network to offer high-speed wireless service during the 2012
Olympics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike Roudi, senior vice president of mobile services at
Time Warner Cable, said the company will use Ruckus gear as part
of a plan to build 10,000 Wi-Fi hot spots around Los Angeles,
including an 11-mile stretch of beaches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The team at Ruckus has built a really good mousetrap,&#8221;
Roudi said. He cited Ruckus&#8217;s antenna design, which helps
maintain a clear signal among competing Wi-Fi networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Carrier Shift &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Lo founded Ruckus in 2004, most phone carriers saw Wi-
Fi as a threat to revenue, because it had the potential to curb
customers&#8217; need to use cellular networks for mobile computing.
While they spent billions to license cellular spectrum from the
U.S. government, Wi-Fi spectrum was unlicensed and could be used
for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the rise of Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPhone and other smartphones
sent data traffic soaring, carriers struggled to maintain
service levels without additional spectrum. Since then, carriers
including ATT Inc. (T) and Verizon Wireless have taken steps to
build up their Wi-Fi networks, including in high-traffic areas
such as sports stadiums, McDonald&#8217;s Corp. restaurants and
Starbucks Corp. coffee shops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, carriers are beginning to adopt a generation of
devices that include both Wi-Fi and cellular technology, said
Infonetics Research co-founder Michael Howard. The goal is for
the network to automatically shift as much traffic as possible
to Wi-Fi, which usually provides a better signal in crowded
urban areas and doesn&#8217;t come with per-minute charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve been talking about carrier Wi-Fi since 2008,&#8221; Lo
said. &#8220;We identified this market, and developed it. We&#8217;re quite
proud.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before starting Ruckus, Lo was vice president of marketing
at Alteon WebSystems, where she oversaw an IPO and then a sale
of the company to Nortel Networks Corp. for $7.8 billion in
2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, Ruckus focused on making technology to improve
Wi-Fi coverage inside consumers&#8217; homes. Then it shifted to
helping companies improve their Wi-Fi networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s been a long haul for Ruckus, but this is going to be
Selina&#8217;s biggest hit,&#8221; said Infonetics&#8217; Howard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s executive compensation packages received endorsements
from ISS Proxy Services USA, the firm whose negative
recommendation helped sink a similar plan at Citigroup Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley displayed &#8220;reasonable
alignment&#8221; between shareholder returns and pay for Jamie Dimon
and James Gorman, the firms&#8217; respective chief executive
officers, ISS analysts wrote in separate reports dated April 27.
Glass Lewis  Co., another shareholder advisory firm, also
endorsed the pay plans for the New York-based banks, which will
hold their meetings on May 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. shareholders rejected an executive pay plan
earlier this month, a first among the six largest U.S. banks,
amid criticism it lets CEO Vikram Pandit collect millions of
dollars in rewards too easily from the No. 3-ranked (C) U.S. lender.
ISS had urged investors to reject Citigroup&#8217;s plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISS said that while JPMorgan &#8220;continues to resist adopting
incentive plans with pre-established goals and long-term
objectives,&#8221; it added a feature &#8220;that provides both an
incentive for sustained performance and some mitigation against
excessive risk-taking.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glass Lewis and ISS also endorsed a shareholder proposal to
require an independent board chairman, which the bank opposes.
Dimon holds the titles of chairman and CEO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Inability&#8217; to Monitor &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, 56, was awarded $23 million in salary and bonuses
for his 2011 performance, the same as he received for 2010,
JPMorgan said in a regulatory filing this month. Gorman, 53, had
his package cut 25 percent to $10.5 million, Morgan Stanley (MS) said
in a filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Lake, a Morgan Stanley spokesman, declined to comment,
as did JPMorgan&#8217;s Joe Evangelisti. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glass Lewis told shareholders to vote against the election
of director Ellen Futter to JPMorgan&#8217;s board. Futter, president
of the Museum of Natural History, previously served on the board
of American International Group Inc. (AIG), the insurer rescued by the
U.S. government in a bailout that swelled to $182.3 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futter, who has served on JPMorgan&#8217;s board since 1997,
showed an &#8220;inability to effectively monitor credit risk during
her tenure at AIG,&#8221; and JPMorgan&#8217;s &#8220;investment activities do
not appear to be any less complex than those of AIG,&#8221; Glass-
Lewis said in its report. JPMorgan has donated an undisclosed
sum to the New York museum Futter runs, the proxy firm said. ISS
recommended shareholders elect Futter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futter didn&#8217;t immediately respond to e-mails sent through
the museum seeking comment on Glass Lewis&#8217;s recommendation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Easing Concerns &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s stock dropped 22 percent last year and Morgan
Stanley fell 44 percent, compared with 18 percent for the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Financials Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Morgan Stanley investors &#8220;remain concerned about the
company&#8217;s continued lagging returns, concerns may be mitigated
by the fact that 2012 incentive awards for the CEO, based on
2011 performance, decreased by 45 percent due to the absence of
a cash bonus payment and stock options,&#8221; ISS wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISS opposed Morgan Stanley&#8217;s proposal to set aside 50
million shares to cover future equity-compensation awards. ISS
said the shares would bring the total available, along with
outstanding options and unvested previous awards, above the
proxy firm&#8217;s allowable cap. Glass Lewis recommended shareholders
vote for the proposal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley responded to ISS&#8217;s opposition in a
regulatory filing today, saying the proxy adviser compared the
firm with a broader range of companies than its direct
competitors. It said a rejection of the proposal would hinder
the bank&#8217;s ability to both align shareholder and employee
interests and to comply with guidance from regulators on pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Poor Disclosure&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glass Lewis recommend shareholders vote against Laura D. Tyson, a professor at University of California, Berkeley&#8217;s Haas
School of Business, who has been an adviser to the Obama
administration and has served on Morgan Stanley&#8217;s board since
1997. Tyson, as head of the bank&#8217;s governance committee, should
be held responsible for its &#8220;poor disclosure&#8221; regarding
transactions with entities affiliated with directors, the proxy
firm said. ISS didn&#8217;t oppose any directors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley doesn&#8217;t have any shareholder proposals up
for vote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barnes  Noble Inc. (BKS)&#8217;s partnership
with Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will accelerate its first expansion into
international markets by providing access to millions of
customers, Chief Executive Officer William Lynch said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t aspire to be anything less than being a leader
in international markets when we launch,&#8221; Lynch said today in a
telephone interview. &#8220;We couldn&#8217;t have done a better deal and
had a better partner than Microsoft that allows us to compete
internationally.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is investing $300 million in a new subsidiary
that combines Barnes  Noble&#8217;s Nook e-reader and college
bookstore businesses, the New York-based retailer said today in
a statement. Microsoft will own about 18 percent of the unit, 
which has yet to be named, and Barnes  Noble will own the 
remainder. The investment values the unit at about $1.7 billion, 
more than Barnes  Noble&#8217;s total market capitalization of about 
$800 million on April 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnes  Noble has been working to expand sales of the Nook
and e-books outside the U.S., including distributing to retail
partners. The venture with Microsoft will develop a Nook
application for Windows 8, the newest version of Microsoft&#8217;s
operating system that will be released this year. That will
allow Barnes  Noble to offer its digital content to consumers
in Europe, Asia and Latin America, Lynch said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Wells
Fargo  Co. (WFC) and Colgate-Palmolive Co. (CL) sold bonds as yields on
highly rated corporate debt fell to record lows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
issued $2 billion of 3.3 percent, three-year notes, while San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo issued $1.5 billion of 2.1 percent,
five-year securities, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Colgate, the world&#8217;s largest toothpaste maker, sold $500 million
of 2.3 percent, 10-year notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies are raising money in the bond market after
yields on U.S. investment-grade debt fell to 3.37 percent on
April 27, the lowest ever and down from 3.9 percent at the
beginning of the year, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank bonds have returned 6.1 percent this year through
April 27, beating the 3.6 percent average gain for all
investment-grade debt, as Europe&#8217;s sovereign debt crisis eased,
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. While spreads on
the financial debt fell to 268 basis points on April 27, that&#8217;s
almost 1 percentage point above last year&#8217;s low of 173 in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on Goldman Sachs have fallen to 269
basis points as of 3:48 p.m. today from 327 basis points at the
beginning of the year, Bloomberg data show. Contracts on Wells
Fargo cost 88, down from 144 on Jan. 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contracts, which typically fall as investor confidence
improves and rise as it deteriorates, pay the buyer face value
if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the value of
the defaulted debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs bonds priced to yield 295 basis points
more than similar-maturity Treasuries, and the Wells Fargo notes
were issued at a 130 basis-point premium, Bloomberg data show.
Colgate issued its debt at a spread of 58. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monster Beverage Corp. (MNST) surged the
most in almost eight years after the Wall Street Journal
reported Coca-Cola Co. (KO) is in talks to buy the maker of energy
drinks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares rose 17 percent to $76.60 at 2:31 p.m. in New
York after climbing as much as 28 percent, the biggest intraday
gain for Corona, California-based Monster since May 7, 2004.
Atlanta-based Coca-Cola fell 0.5 percent to $76.24. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola may sell some of its bottling assets to help pay
for the takeover, the Journal said, citing unidentified people
familiar with the situation. A tie-up with Coca-Cola would give
Monster better access to international markets, where it is
second to leader Red Bull with a little more than half its
volume share, according to Euromonitor Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Coke would be able to grow Monster internationally at a
far more rapid pace,&#8221; Thomas Mullarkey, an analyst for
Morningstar Inc. (MORN) in Chicago, said today in a telephone
interview. &#8220;If Coke wants to compete in energy drinks,
acquiring is a faster way to achieve it.&#8221; Mullarkey had said
Monster was worth $73 a share in a buyout, before today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monster trades at more than 30 times estimated 2012
earnings, and Coca-Cola may not want to pay a large premium for
the beverage-maker because the two companies already have a
distribution deal, the Journal reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economists at Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. predicted that payrolls in the U.S. climbed by 125,000 in
April, compared with a 120,000 increase the previous month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Led by Jan Hatzius in New York, the group&#8217;s forecast
compares with a 162,000 median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey of 79 economists ahead of the May 4 employment report
from the Labor Department. Hatzius cited unseasonably warm
winter as the main reason for the projection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gains in hiring and wages are needed to support household
purchasing, which increased 0.3 percent in March, Commerce
Department figures show. An unemployment rate exceeding 8
percent for more than three years helps explain why Federal
Reserve policy makers are sticking to a plan to boost growth and
employment by holding borrowing costs low through late 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are forecasting a nonfarm payroll gain of just 125,000
in April because we expect a substantial payback for the warm
winter,&#8221; Hatzius wrote in an April 27 note to clients. &#8220;The
payroll acceleration in the winter was confined to the normally
cold states. Moreover, the fact that March payroll gains in the
cold states looked similar to the pre-winter norm suggests that
most of the payback has yet to occur.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unseasonably mild temperatures may have spurred more hiring
in some industries. The January to March period was the warmest
first quarter in records going back to 1895, according to the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weather effect &#8220;will lead to a payback of at least
50,000 in the April report,&#8221; Hatzius wrote. &#8220;The evidence for
slower U.S. growth is accumulating.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Christine Harper" date="May 01, 2012  8:39 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-01/goldman-sachs-says-fed-risk-rules-will-cut-jobs-economic-growth.html"><headline>Goldman Says Rule Curbing Counterparty Links Risks Jobs</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said a
proposed Federal Reserve rule seeking to limit links between
banks could cut U.S. economic growth by as much as 0.4
percentage point and eliminate as many as 300,000 jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estimate, the most specific so far in reaction to the
Fed&#8217;s proposed rule, was based on New York-based Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
own research and assessment of how it would affect the corporate
debt market, according to an April 30 letter to the Fed that was
made public yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The impact on the corporate bond market alone could drive
the elimination of 150,000 to 300,000 American jobs,&#8221; wrote
Goldman Sachs Chief Risk Officer Craig W. Broderick. &#8220;Smaller
companies that lack access to alternative sources of capital --
and that drive job creation -- would be hardest hit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank joined rivals including JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM),
Citigroup Inc. (C) and Morgan Stanley in opposing a rule that would
limit financial firms with at least $500 billion in assets from
having credit risk to any other exceeding 10 percent of its
regulatory capital plus excess loan-loss reserves. That limit is
stricter than a 25 percent limit that&#8217;s applied more broadly to
banks in the Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, had
$77.1 billion in total regulatory capital and no loan-loss
reserves as of Dec. 31, according to the firm&#8217;s annual filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief executive officers of the largest U.S. banks,
including New York-based JPMorgan, are set to meet with Fed
Governor Daniel Tarullo today to discuss the proposed rule as
well as the Fed&#8217;s recent stress tests of banks, four people
familiar with the meeting said earlier this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Derivatives Market Impact &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One concern for the banks is how the limits would affect
the market for derivatives. As of December, five firms accounted
for 96 percent of the total U.S. banking industry&#8217;s notional
holdings in derivatives and 86 percent of the industry&#8217;s net
current credit exposure in derivatives, according to the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed limits &#8220;greatly overstate credit exposures,
particularly with respect to counterparty exposure arising from
derivatives,&#8221; Citigroup Chief Risk Officer Brian Leach said in
a letter to the Fed. &#8220;The overstatement of the credit exposure
will require financial institutions to substantially reduce
lending to customers, reduce market-making activities in
derivative instruments on behalf of customers, and either
purchase less credit protection, or purchase credit protection
from smaller, less well-capitalized institutions or from &#8216;shadow
banking&#8217; firms.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Technical Flaws&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed&#8217;s method of measuring counterparty credit doesn&#8217;t
consider that some contracts offset each other and that trading
partners receive collateral to mitigate potential risks,
according to Goldman Sachs&#8217;s letter. These issues, along with
other &#8220;technical flaws&#8221; in the proposed rule&#8217;s approach, would
lead counterparty exposures to be overestimated by as much as
four to 18 times the actual risk, the company wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A firm also may be hindered in lending to small businesses
if its attempt to buy protection from other banks pushes it over
the exposure limits, according to Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed should &#8220;conduct a full quantitative impact study
on the overstatement of exposure and interconnectedness&#8221; under
the so-called single counterparty credit limit &#8220;and the
implications of that overstatement for U.S. financial markets
and U.S. economic activity,&#8221; according to the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Business Roundtable &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the
Business Roundtable have successfully challenged the legality of
other regulatory measures by claiming authorities didn&#8217;t fully
assess the costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington overturned
a Securities and Exchange Commission rule that would have
expanded shareholder rights. That has made future SEC rules
vulnerable to similar challenges, forcing agency Chairman Mary Schapiro to redouble efforts to study cost-benefit effects,
slowing the rulemaking process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Bleier, a former Fed lawyer and now a partner at
Reed Smith LLP, said the banks&#8217; comments will sway regulators
and that the central bank may &#8220;have to rethink&#8221; its analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Fed will ultimately have to raise that 10 percent
limit,&#8221; Bleier said. &#8220;That should be accompanied by some type
of economic analysis to determine what the right number is.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limits also could reduce banks&#8217; use of clearinghouses
to trade derivatives and damage sovereign-debt markets because
banks would be limited in how much credit they could extend to
foreign governments, according to the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Aggregation Requirement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The proposed rules&#8217; aggregation requirement also creates
difficulties by casting the net too broadly,&#8221; Goldman Sachs
wrote. &#8220;It requires covered companies to aggregate all
&#8216;controlled&#8217; subsidiaries, defined as 25 percent or more of the
voting shares or equity, which will be difficult for covered
companies to do in practice.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS), the sixth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, said
the Fed&#8217;s definition of what constitutes &#8220;controlling&#8221; a
subsidiary would force it to include the exposures held by a
Japanese joint venture that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306)
operates. Including those risks would &#8220;constrain its ability to
enter into credit transactions with counterparties whose
obligations are also held by the joint venture,&#8221; Morgan Stanley
Chief Risk Officer Keishi Hotsuki wrote in a letter to the Fed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, in a list of recommendations to the central
bank, said the 25 percent limit on single counterparty credit
should be applied to all companies &#8220;regardless of asset size&#8221;
and that clearinghouses and &#8220;high-quality sovereigns&#8221; be
excluded from the limits. Subsidiaries also should be excluded
unless they&#8217;re consolidated for financial-reporting purposes,
according to the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm called on the Fed to let companies wait until July
2015 to conform to the rules and spend an additional five years
to implement monitoring of the limits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This additional time would allow covered companies to
carefully reduce their excess exposures,&#8221; Goldman Sachs wrote.
&#8220;Allowing time for this to occur would reduce the risk of &#8216;fire
sales&#8217; or serious market disruptions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time in more than two

&lt;p&gt;That path tracks through a patch of sealed Soviet-era
natural gas wells that are ready to be tapped once again and
fields of shale rocks that the U.S. Geological Survey estimates
will hold enough gas to fire the eastern European nation for 100 
years or more. Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), and 
Chevron Corp. (CVX) -- three of the world&#8217;s four largest oil companies
-- bid last week for Ukrainian exploration rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ukraine is low-hanging fruit,&#8221; said Bertrand des Pallieres, chief executive officer of Cadogan Petroleum Plc (CAD), a 
London-based oil explorer with interests in 14 Ukrainian fields. 
&#8220;Ukraine has well-known basins that have been totally 
undermanaged and underinvested,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There is a consensus 
in the industry that its potential is great.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same technology that unlocked natural gas from shale
rocks and made the U.S. the world&#8217;s largest natural gas producer
is being rolled out across eastern Europe, home to the
continent&#8217;s most promising prospects. If drilling succeeds,
Ukraine will be able to lessen its reliance on Russian export
monopoly OAO Gazprom (GAZP) for its natural gas supply, ending the
economy&#8217;s vulnerability to decisions taken in the Kremlin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country, part of the Russian empire from the 18th
century and then a Soviet republic until 1991, also has
thousands of conventional natural gas wells, many of which were
sealed and abandoned in the 1970s when the Soviet state decided
to move production to Siberia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Auction Rights &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ukraine plans to auction the rights to as much as 70
percent of production at the Oleska field in the western part of
the country and the Yuzivska field in the east by May 23. The
areas contain both shale and conventional gas deposits, and the
bidders, which also included Eni SpA (ENI) and TNK-BP, each paid
between $1.3 million and $1.9 million to apply for the license,
according to the government. The state also plans to sell two
licenses for gas exploration in the Black Sea and another one
inland in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Thanks to all the historical activity there is a lot of
available data, as opposed to wildcat exploration,&#8221; des
Pallieres said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country has the potential to triple its domestic
production to 60 billion cubic meters a year by 2030 with the
help of international oil companies, he said. That would bring
it up to the level last seen in the 1960s, when it supplied one
third of the Soviet Union&#8217;s gas needs, and end its dependence on
Russia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gazprom&#8217;s Grip &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ukraine is eager to loosen Gazprom&#8217;s grip on its economy.
NAK Naftogaz Ukrainy, the state monopoly, bought 45 billion
cubic meters of natural gas from Russia last year, paying $13.9
billion, or 8.4 percent of Ukraine&#8217;s gross domestic product,
Deputy Finance Minister Anatilyi Myarkovskyi said on March 16.
The country wants to cut the price to $250 per 1,000 cubic
meters from the $416 it paid in the first quarter to trim the
budget deficit, which reached 4.3 percent of GDP in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia has so far refused to lower the price unless Ukraine
surrenders control over its pipelines, which have carried as
much as 80 percent of gas moving from Siberia westwards to the
European Union. Gazprom has twice in the past six years cut
natural gas deliveries to Ukraine on New Year&#8217;s Day because of
pricing disputes. In a further setback, Russia began rerouting
some supplies to Europe through the Nord Stream pipeline in the
Baltic Sea and another across Belarus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coming Decade &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To triple its domestic production to Soviet-era levels,
Ukraine needs to invest as much as $10 billion a year in the
coming decade, des Pallieres has estimated. That will not be
possible without the participation of foreign companies because
Naftogaz is so cash-starved it can barely maintain the current
production levels, said Vitaliy Radchenko, an energy researcher
at CMS Cameron McKenna in Kiev. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The state companies are almost bankrupt because the state
limits how much they can get for the gas they produce,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;The private producers won&#8217;t be subject to such severe
price limitations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naftogaz reported a loss of 20.6 billion hryvnia ($2.6
billion) last year, the Finance Ministry said. President Viktor Yanukovych is unlikely to raise household gas prices before the
end of the year as his party faces parliamentary elections in
October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Red Tape &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up to now most foreign investors have been cautious in
embracing Ukraine. The country&#8217;s unstable political climate,
excessive red tape and high corruption levels have kept foreign
business away, Radchenko said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent setbacks in shale-gas exploration in neighboring
Poland have also raised questions about the region&#8217;s potential.
The Polish government said last month shale-gas reserves may be
lower than previously estimated and drilling a well costs almost
three times as much as in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Ukraine&#8217;s gas reserves are &#8220;enormous&#8221; and the
government has made considerable progress in improving the
investor climate, said Ulrich Benterbusch, the director of
Global Energy Dialogue at the International Energy Agency who is
drawing a list of energy policy recommendations for the
Ukrainian government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For years key policy makers in Ukraine were betting on
the fact that somehow they would get the cheap Russian gas,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Now it&#8217;s clear that this is over, so that puts a lot of
pressure on the system to change. There is money to be earned
and gas to be found, and not just in small quantities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM),
the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider, has offered
incentives to some long-serving and senior U.S. employees to
retire by the end of next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eligible employees who volunteer to retire by Dec. 31,
2013, may work 60 percent of their hours for 70 percent of their
pay and retain full-time equivalent benefits, Doug Shelton, a
spokesman for Armonk, New York-based IBM said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eligible include some of the company&#8217;s most senior and
experienced employees -- those with more than 30 years at IBM,
those older than 55 who have worked there more than 15 years,
and those older than 62 with more than five years at IBM --
provided they had satisfactory performance ratings in 2011 and
meet some other criteria. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called transition program follows IBM&#8217;s efforts
since 2005 to help some full-time employees move into teaching
and a plan introduced in 2008 that encourages staff into public
service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s strictly voluntary, but provides incentives to keep
retirement eligible employees on board to give them time to plan
for what they want to do after they retire,&#8221; Shelton said. &#8220;It
allows the company to plan for their retirement as well, because
we&#8217;ll be in a better position to identify what skills and
resources we need as people retire.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Drew Armstrong" date="May 01, 2012  4:07 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-01/pfizer-beats-estimates-as-company-readies-animal-health-spin-off.html"><headline>Pfizer Pipeline Bet to Show If Drugmaker Has Blockbuster</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer
Ian Read will find out in the next six months whether his plan
to shed units and focus on new drugs will pay off, with three
top products awaiting approval or key data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulators will rule on
Pfizer&#8217;s blood thinner and arthritis pill by June and August,
respectively. The New York-based company plans to report data
from the last of three phases of clinical tests on bapineuzumab,
its experimental Alzheimer&#8217;s treatment, in the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Read is buying back shares, arguing that
Pfizer&#8217;s best investment of cash is the drugmaker&#8217;s stock.
&#8220;There&#8217;s always a discontinuity between what the street sees
and puts in our share price for our pipeline, and what we can
see in our pipeline,&#8221; Chief Financial Officer Frank D&#8217;Amelio
said today in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is trying to move past its dependence on Lipitor,
the best-selling cholesterol pill that lost marketing
exclusivity last November. Investors are awaiting more clarity
on how Read will divest the company&#8217;s animal health unit,
scheduled to be announced by July. The world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker
said last month it would sell its infant nutrition unit to
Vevey, Switzerland-based Nestle SA (NESN) for $11.9 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read also is reorganizing the company&#8217;s brand-name drug
business to separate it from what Pfizer calls the &#8220;established
products&#8221; line, including medicines that have gone off-patent
as well as emerging markets sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Get a Feel&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to get a feel for how the two business units
look and feel and run,&#8221; Read said today in a telephone
interview. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to get a feel for how the innovative core
strengthens its pipeline.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read said he hasn&#8217;t yet considered splitting brand-name and
established products into different companies. &#8220;It&#8217;s far too
premature to talk about the businesses being separate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tony Butler, an analyst with Barclays Capital in New York,
said he doesn&#8217;t forecast an increase in revenue for Pfizer from
now until 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What you&#8217;re left with after the divestiture is a
pharmaceutical business that will be smaller, but has a number
of challenges from a growth perspective,&#8221; Butler said today in
an interview with Bloomberg TV. &#8220;New products drive revenue
change, and while Pfizer does have some, they&#8217;re not enough.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Profit Falls &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier today, the New York-based company reported first-
quarter profit fell 19 percent after revenue from Lipitor
declined because of generic competition. The company trimmed its
2012 forecast after the sale of the nutritional unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income dropped to $1.79 billion, or 24 cents a share,
from $2.2 billion, or 28 cents, a year earlier. Earnings
excluding one-time items beat by 2 cents the 56-cent average of
19 analysts estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer declined less than 1 percent to $22.78 at the close
in New York. The shares have gained 8.6 percent in the past 12
months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer plans to release data on its Alzheimer&#8217;s treatment,
bapineuzumab, in the third quarter of this year, Olivier Brandicourt, president of primary care, said today on a
conference call discussing the earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) and Elan Corp. (ELN) are partners on
the Alzheimer&#8217;s drug. One of the two studies Pfizer is
conducting has finished, and another will be done in several
months, Brandicourt said. And on May 9, a panel advising the FDA
will make recommendations on tofacitinib, Pfizer&#8217;s experimental
pill to treat arthritis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Surprises &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing they&#8217;ve done that&#8217;s been shocking or
concerning to us,&#8221; Geno Germano, Pfizer&#8217;s president of
specialty care, said of the regulators&#8217; review. The FDA is
scheduled to rule on tofacitinib by Aug. 20, and the drug if
approved may be worth $1.5 billion to Pfizer this year, John Boris, an analyst for Citigroup, said in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eliquis, a blood thinner developed with Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co., will get an FDA decision by the end of June. The
drugmakers will split sales from the pill, which Tim Anderson,
an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in New York,
estimates at $2.5 billion annually by 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said full-year profit will be $1.23 to $1.38 a
share, compared with a previous forecast for as much as $1.52.
The change was from sale of company&#8217;s the nutrition unit, the
drugmaker said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Revenue Decline &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue fell to $15.4 billion from $16.5 billion a year
earlier, hurt by a 25 percent drop in sales from its
pharmaceutical business because of the loss of Lipitor&#8217;s U.S.
patent protection. The sales decline was made up for with a 7
percent cut to costs, excluding the impact of foreign exchange,
part of Read&#8217;s plan to make the company more efficient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer also said that it took a $450 million charge after
agreeing to settle a lawsuit with Brigham Young University over
credit for development of the arthritis painkiller Celebrex. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of Lipitor, still Pfizer&#8217;s best-selling drug, fell 42
percent to $1.4 billion. Those declines were led by a 71 percent
fall in the U.S., after the cholesterol pill lost patent
exclusivity in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read said last week that Pfizer is deciding how it will
shed the animal health unit, which makes drugs for pets and
livestock and had sales of $4.18 billion last year. The
drugmaker is likely to divest the unit in a combined initial
public offering and share swap, he said, in which Pfizer would
sell some stock on the open market and exchange a portion of
Pfizer shares for stock in the new company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;QBE Insurance Group Ltd. (QBE), Australia&#8217;s
biggest insurer, hired Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. to sell a 46-acre
(19-hectare) office campus just south of Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s
headquarters near Seattle, the brokerage said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The property in Bellevue, Washington, encompasses nine
buildings with 326,384 rentable square feet (30,320 square
meters) that are 62 percent occupied, Jones Lang said in a
statement. QBE, based in Sydney, has a 10-year lease for 67,370
square feet in one of the buildings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seller is aiming to fetch more than $80 million for the
property, formerly known as the Unigard campus, said a person
with knowledge of the proposed deal, who asked not to be
identified because the information is private. Office rents and
occupancies are rising in the region amid hiring by local
employers including Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Boeing Co. (BA) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This offering should receive intense interest from both
institutional investors around the globe, as well as local
development firms,&#8221; Ann Chamberlin, a Seattle-based managing
director of Jones Lang, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bids are expected the week of May 21, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paula Symons, a spokeswoman for QBE in Sun Prairie,
Wisconsin, declined to comment. QBE&#8217;s North American
headquarters is in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QBE shares have fallen 26 percent in the past year amid
record natural disaster claims, including for floods in
Thailand, 19 U.S. tornadoes, earthquakes in New Zealand and
Japan, and Cyclone Yasi in Australia&#8217;s Queensland state. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Oil Co. of Liberia will
hold talks with Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Canadian Overseas
Petroleum Ltd. after it approved in principle a plan that would
see Exxon take 70 percent control of an offshore oil block. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nocal looks forward to working with Exxon Mobil and COPL
to conclude a fair contractual agreement and bring the saga of
Block 13 to a satisfactory conclusion,&#8221; Randolph A.K.W.
McClain, president and chief executive officer of the Liberian
company, said in a statement published yesterday on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed deal will see the current owners of the block,
Isle of Man-registered Peppercoast Petroleum Plc, transfer its
100 percent interest to a unit of Calgary-based Canadian
Overseas (XOP), known as COPL. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon will immediately get a 70 percent stake from COPL,
according to the statement from Nocal, as the Liberian company
is known. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talks will take place in London next week and include
McClain, as well as Liberia&#8217;s ministers of justice, finance and
lands, mines and energy, according to Nocal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) President and
Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn was in the hot seat last night
at the Friends of the High Line Spring Benefit, supporting the
park built on elevated railroad tracks along Manhattan&#8217;s far
West Side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On stage to accept an award on behalf of the company, Cohn
was seated right behind the lectern. This meant that whenever
someone spoke, he, too, was captured on the giant projection
screens around the room, in his gray suit and pink tie with sea
horses on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Occupy Wall Street protests were taking place across
the U.S. yesterday, Cohn managed to smile and look interested
through speeches by Sarah Jessica Parker and Darren Walker, an
officer at the Ford Foundation who spoke of the importance of
High Line programs for the 5,000 public-housing residents who
live next to the park. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artist Jeff Koons talked about his expensive idea to
suspend a real, working train car vertically above the High
Line. He was in the right room to court a funder for the
project, with guests including Pershing Square Capital
Management founder Bill Ackman and David Rockefeller, board
chairman of the Rockefeller Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohn, for his part, said Goldman and its people have given
more than $6 million to the High Line and more than $1 billion
to philanthropic initiatives in the past five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pier 57 Menu &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the 1,000 guests gathered at Pier 57 talked through
the remarks, distracted by the succulents decorating the tables
courtesy of Bronson van Wyck, and the family-style meal courtesy
of the caterer Bite. Among the offerings were spiced fried
chicken with ginger watermelon skewers, shaved black kale with
hen-of-the-woods and slow-braised short ribs. Parker House rolls
and pats of butter seasoned with thyme and sea salt accompanied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another diversion was the people-spotting: film director
Spike Lee, actor Ed Norton and New York City Planning Commission
Chairwoman Amanda Burden were all present. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, Cohn and Koons sat together at the head table with
Google (GOOG) Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt, whose date was his
daughter Sophie, and former chairman and chief executive of
Morgan Stanley, John Mack, whose companions were his children
Jenna and Stephen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohn said his favorite conversation of the night was with
Barry Diller, chairman and senior executive of
IAC/InterActiveCorp. (IACI) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We talked about the world and the regulatory
environment,&#8221; he said as the party wound down, around 11 p.m. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefit raised more than $3 million. The party favor
was an umbrella with a rendering of the &#8220;Train&#8221; project by
Koons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Playing Safe &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An umbrella was also the giveaway at today&#8217;s Central Park
Conservancy benefit, where the total raised was $3.5 million and
one corporate sponsor of note was JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary Erdoes, chief executive, J.P. Morgan Asset Management,
announced the firm&#8217;s $3 million donation to &#8220;Central Play,&#8221;
the conservancy&#8217;s campaign to renovate Central Park playgrounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far the conservancy has renovated five playgrounds for
safety, accessibility, sustainability and fun, said the park&#8217;s
chief administrator, Douglas Blonsky. The work at 16 other
playgrounds will take place over the next seven years and cost
about $30 million, he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The luncheon under a tent in the park&#8217;s Conservatory Garden
was a fashion playground for 1,200 guests. Erdoes wore a gray
Roland Mouret dress and Abigail Aldridge hat purchased at the
Hat Shop on New York&#8217;s Thompson Street. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Albee&#8217;s Bark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edward Albee made his presence known last night at the PEN
American Center&#8217;s 90th anniversary gala. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;re going on too long!&#8221; the author of &#8220;Who&#8217;s Afraid
of Virginia Woolf?&#8221; barked at fellow playwright Tony Kushner
under the blue whale at the American Museum of Natural History. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the podium, Albee accepted the PEN Literary Service
Award and recounted his youthful misadventures as poet, novelist
and short-story writer. He also improvised a brief interview
with a tyro reporter, playing both roles, before praising PEN
for championing freedom of expression for writers, editors and
publishers around the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of PEN was made clear by the others honored. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Imprisoned Publisher &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2012 Jeri Laber International Freedom to Publish Award
went to Turkey&#8217;s Ragip Zarakolu, whose Belge Publishing House
has translated and published Turkish editions of works by
Armenian, Greek and Kurdish writers on such subjects as the
Armenian genocide and the repression of the Kurdish minority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His children Seref and Zerrin Holle accepted the award.
Zarakolu is in prison for allegedly endorsing terrorism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eskinder Nega, a jailed Ethiopian journalist and blogger on
trial for terrorism, received the PEN/Barbara Goldsmith Freedom
to Write Award. He is being held in Maekelawi Prison in Addis
Ababa, and may face the death penalty if convicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His wife, Serkalem Fasil, traveled to New York to accept
the award on her husband&#8217;s behalf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Prison has been Eskinder&#8217;s home away from home for the
past two decades,&#8221; she told the audience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sold $1.4
billion of bonds backed by debt on a Hawaiian mall, according to
a person familiar with the offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A $1 billion slice carrying top grades and maturing in 9.91
years yields 135 basis points more than the benchmark swap rate,
said the person, who declined to be identified because the terms
aren&#8217;t public. A portion rated Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s Investors
Service, the lowest investment-grade ranking, yields 260 basis
points more than the benchmark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal is composed of a single loan on a 2.42 million
square-foot property in Honolulu, Hawaii, according to
Morningstar Inc. The mortgaged parcel consists primarily of the
Ala Moana Center, an open-air mall anchored by stores including
Macy&#8217;s and Neiman Marcus, Morningstar said in a report earlier
this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street banks have arranged about $8 billion in deals
backed primarily by shopping malls, office buildings and hotels
in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Banks issued
$28 billion in 2011. Sales are forecast to climb as high as $45
billion this year, according to Credit Suisse Group AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market for bonds tied to everything from skyscrapers to
strip malls was roiled this month by the auction of $7.5 billion
in commercial real estate debt assumed by the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York in the rescue of American International Group
Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relative yields on benchmark securities narrowed by as much
as 15 basis points, or 0.15 percentage point, to 225 basis
points over the swap rate last week after the district bank
completed the sale, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
agreed to buy Tealeaf Technology Inc., gaining software that
helps marketing executives analyze online buying data and
respond faster to trends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closely held Tealeaf, located in San Francisco, provides
real-time insights about Internet spending on mobile and desktop
devices, IBM said today in a statement. IBM, based in Armonk,
New York, didn&#8217;t disclose terms of the acquisition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider expects
software to deliver half of its earnings in 2015, driven in part
by its Smarter Commerce initiative. IBM has made more than $3
billion in acquisitions, including Unica Corp. and DemandTec
Inc., to add software tools that help businesses uncover trends,
improve online transactions and better deploy their employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tealeaf&#8217;s technology spots patterns where online promotions
and transactions work and fail, helping businesses capture
customer data and deliver &#8220;optimal experiences,&#8221; Rebecca Ward,
its chief executive officer, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tealeaf was founded in 1999 and spun off from SAP AG (SAP), the
biggest maker of business management software. It has more than
450 customers worldwide in financial services, travel, retail
and communications services, including Dell Inc., Wells Fargo 
Co., Zappos.com Inc. and Best Buy Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tealeaf is backed by venture-capital firms including
Foundation Capital, Matrix Partners, and Bay Partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM rose less than 1 percent to $208.13 at 1:03 p.m. New
York time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) hired Takashi Miura
from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. as a Tokyo-based credit
strategist, replacing Hidetoshi Ohashi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miura, who joined Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities Co.
yesterday, will cover Japan&#8217;s credit markets including corporate
bonds and credit-default swaps, Natsuo Nishio, a spokesman for
the brokerage, said by telephone today. Miura had joined Goldman
in 2000 from Rating and Investment Information Inc., a Japanese
risk assessor, Nishio said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohashi is leaving the firm at the end of June to start a
hedge fund, a person familiar with the matter said April 25,
asking not to be identified as the details are private. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), just months
after being assailed by an ex-employee for harboring a &#8220;toxic&#8221;
culture, faces a harsh spotlight this month in Manhattan federal
court over how well a senior official guarded its secrets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajat Gupta, a former Goldman Sachs director, goes on trial
May 21 on charges of giving inside information to Raj Rajaratnam, the Galleon Group LLC co-founder serving 11 years in
prison for insider trading. Gupta&#8217;s lawyers said they may 
point to others at the bank who passed Rajaratnam illegal tips.
At least three other Goldman Sachs employees are said to be
under investigation related to Galleon insider trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The renewed scrutiny of Goldman Sachs comes after the firm
endured a wave of publicity that drove down its stock price in
the short term. Most recently, former derivatives trader Greg Smith in a March New York Times opinion piece criticized the
company&#8217;s treatment of clients. Goldman Sachs&#8217;s market value
fell $2.15 billion the day it was published. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, a Delaware judge criticized the New
York-based company&#8217;s handling of El Paso Corp.&#8217;s takeover by
Kinder Morgan (KMI) Inc. In 2010, U.S. Senator Carl Levin called
hearings on the financial industry, and the bank settled a
Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit for $550 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s almost more like the Chinese water torture,&#8221; said
William D. Cohan, author of &#8220;Money and Power: How Goldman Sachs
Came to Rule the World.&#8221; &#8220;There&#8217;s a cumulative effect -- not
only this trial and this incident but what the judge in the
Delaware Chancery Court wrote about El Paso-Kinder Morgan,
Senator Levin&#8217;s all-day hearing, the SEC lawsuit, the relentless
pounding in the media, the Greg Smith thing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Won&#8217;t Suffer &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s revenue may not suffer, because clients
will continue to turn to the New York-based company, Cohan, a
Bloomberg View columnist, said in a telephone interview. The
bank has outperformed the SP Financials Sector Index this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, the fifth-
largest U.S. bank by assets, declined to comment on how it will
handle publicity from a monthlong Gupta trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Levin, a Michigan Democrat, alleged in 2010 that the
firm put its own interests ahead of clients&#8217;, Goldman Sachs has
come under persistent criticism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July 2010, Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $550 million to
resolve SEC allegations that it misled investors in
collateralized debt obligations linked to subprime mortgages by
not disclosing that hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the
underlying securities and then bet against them. Goldman Sachs 
didn&#8217;t admit wrongdoing. Fabrice Tourre, a Goldman Sachs trader 
who was also sued in the case, is fighting the SEC&#8217;s allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chancery Court &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delaware Chancery Court Judge Leo Strine rebuked Goldman
Sachs in February for advising El Paso (EP) after Kinder Morgan, in
which it held a $4 billion stake, bid for the company. The
judge, who questioned the bank&#8217;s handling of an alleged conflict
of interest, didn&#8217;t block the deal, which is expected to close
in the second quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith quit in March after writing an opinion piece in the
New York Times describing a &#8220;toxic and destructive&#8221; culture, a
claim Goldman Sachs denies. The shares fell 3.4 percent in New
York trading after the article ran. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an April 25 interview with Bloomberg Television, Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein addressed the damage the
company&#8217;s reputation has sustained in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Shame on us,&#8221; Blankfein said, for &#8220;not anticipating&#8221;
how the public would perceive the firm after the financial
crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;How Important&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re going to have to do a better job -- we&#8217;re going to
have to do a job -- in getting out there in telling people how
important this industry is and what it does when we advise
companies on their growth plans, when we help finance those
growth plans, when we manage their assets for them, and how
important this is for the economy, the markets and obviously
society at large,&#8221; Blankfein told Bloomberg TV&#8217;s Erik Schatzker
on &#8220;InBusiness With Margaret Brennan.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta&#8217;s trial will be first in a nationwide crackdown on
insider trading that started with Rajaratnam&#8217;s case in 2009 to
focus squarely on Goldman Sachs. Gupta is accused of tipping
Rajaratnam, his one-time friend and business partner, about the
bank and Procter  Gamble Co. (PG), where Gupta also served as a
director. Gupta ran consulting firm McKinsey  Co. from 1994 to
2003 and was on the Goldman Sachs board from 2006 to 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Illicit Profits&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tips included details of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s earnings in the
first quarter of 2007 and fourth quarter of 2008, as well as the
$5 billion investment in the bank by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/B) in
September 2008, prosecutors said. The leaks generated &#8220;illicit
profits and loss avoidance&#8221; of more than $23 million, the SEC
alleged in a related lawsuit. Gupta, who denies wrongdoing,
faces as long as 20 years in prison if convicted of securities
fraud and conspiracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co., said
there&#8217;s &#8220;no evidence whatsoever&#8221; that Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
investment banking franchise is at risk from the Gupta case. At
the same time, clients will be watching to see who might have
breached a duty to the firm by leaking confidential information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;So long as this does not come from senior people --
managing directors and above -- the damage is manageable,&#8221;
Hintz said in a telephone interview. &#8220;If it comes above that,
then you end up with a reputational damage that can affect a
willingness of the clients to engage you.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Executive Wiretap &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary Naftalis, Gupta&#8217;s lawyer, has said in court that
prosecutors told him two other Goldman Sachs employees are
suspected of leaking tips about companies including Apple Inc. (AAPL)
and Intel Corp. (INTC) Naftalis said one was an executive caught on a
wiretap talking to Rajaratnam. Without naming the person,
Naftalis said the defense may present evidence of the other
tippers at Gupta&#8217;s trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerika Richardson, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan, declined to comment on the case. Paul Fox,
a spokesman for Cincinnati-based Procter  Gamble, didn&#8217;t
immediately return calls for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bradley Simon, a former federal prosecutor now in private
practice in New York, said the disclosure of other possible
leakers is a &#8220;gift&#8221; to Gupta that Naftalis is sure to exploit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The government has to remove almost all doubt,&#8221; he said
in a telephone interview. &#8220;How do you know it wasn&#8217;t one of
these individuals instead of Gupta? It does pose a problem for
the government if the jury says, &#8216;We&#8217;re not totally sure.&#8217; Then
they&#8217;re obligated to acquit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Under Investigation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two other Goldman Sachs employees -- David Loeb, head of
Asia Equity Sales in New York and a managing director, and Henry King, a technology analyst in Hong Kong -- are under U.S.
investigation, according to people with knowledge of the probes
who weren&#8217;t authorized to speak publicly. It&#8217;s unclear if Loeb
or King are the employees referred to by Naftalis and in letters
prosecutors filed in court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loeb and King didn&#8217;t respond to e-mails seeking comment.
Goldman Sachs has declined to comment on Loeb and King. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third employee, Matthew Korenberg, a managing director
based in San Francisco, has been the subject of a U.S. insider-
trading investigation for 2 1/2 years related to Galleon, said
his lawyer, John Hueston. Korenberg remained employed by Goldman
Sachs and has never been investigated for passing tips to
Rajaratnam, Hueston said in an April 26 interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has &#8220;fully cooperated&#8221; with federal
authorities for more than two years on the Korenberg probe, the
company said in an April 26 statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The multiyear investigation that he has been involved
with has resulted in nothing,&#8221; Hueston said. &#8220;He has never
tipped any information. He was never alleged to have tipped any
inside information. He has had a distinguished career at Goldman
Sachs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;May Benefit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frank Razzano, a Pepper Hamilton LLP lawyer not involved in
any Galleon-related insider-trading cases, said Gupta&#8217;s defense
may benefit from multiple Goldman Sachs executives being
implicated in leaking information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a very good case if you can come forward with
evidence to show that the government got the wrong person,&#8221;
said Razzano, who is among the few defense attorneys in the U.S.
to win a client&#8217;s acquittal in an insider-trading case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jurors are likely to hear from Goldman Sachs executives,
court papers indicate. Blankfein testified at Rajaratnam&#8217;s trial
last year that Gupta violated the firm&#8217;s confidentiality
policies by allegedly telling Rajaratnam about the firm&#8217;s
earnings and strategic plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Relevant&#8217; Information &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the SEC lawsuit, Gupta&#8217;s lawyers have said that
Blankfein, Chief Financial Officer David Viniar, President Gary Cohn, Loeb and retiring Lead Director John Bryan may have
information &#8220;relevant&#8221; to the defense. Another possible
witness is Goldman Sachs director Claes Dahlback, a former CEO
of Sweden&#8217;s Investor AB, who was interviewed by the government,
prosecutors told a judge in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naftalis declined to comment on his possible witnesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s relationship with Galleon may also come
into view. Gupta is alleged to have tipped Rajaratnam in 2007
after listening to a Goldman Sachs board meeting while at
Galleon&#8217;s offices. Jurors may hear that Goldman Sachs routinely
catered lunch for Galleon traders, as the bank did for other big
clients, according to an ex-Galleon employee who declined to
comment publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthony Sabino, a lawyer and professor at the Peter J.
Tobin College of Business at St. John&#8217;s University in New York,
said the publicity will sting even if it doesn&#8217;t cost the firm
business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you want to do a deal these days in the U.S., you go
to Goldman, you go to Morgan Stanley,&#8221; he said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;But when you have multiple instances, then people
may say it&#8217;s indicative of a lack of internal controls or a
permissiveness that lets this thing go on. It&#8217;s a slap in the
face to management.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Pickup Basketball&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ronn Torossian, CEO of 5W Public Relations LLC in New York,
which has done work for Coca-Cola Co. (KO) and McDonald&#8217;s Corp. (MCD), said
Goldman Sachs should move quickly to reclaim its reputation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company should stress to the public that recent events
involve just a few of its 32,000 employees and that it demands
that all employees act ethically, he said. Workers must be
&#8220;completely above-board,&#8221; he said, not even &#8220;cheating in
their pickup basketball games.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Any time you have a stellar firm like that and the words
&#8216;insider trading&#8217; next to it -- you start to wonder how long
does it go, how much more is there?&#8221; he said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to distance yourself from crisis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Gupta, 11-cr-907, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) won dismissal
of some claims in a lawsuit brought by CIFG Assurance North
America Inc. over $275 million in residential mortgage-backed
securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insurer sued Goldman Sachs in New York State Supreme
Court in Manhattan in August, accusing the investment bank of
making misrepresentations in connection with the securitization
of a portfolio of 6,204 mortgage loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs asked the court in October to dismiss six of
the eight claims in the suit, arguing that CIFG was informed of
the risks associated with the investments, failed to conduct due
diligence on its own, and hasn&#8217;t sought contractual remedies
that would allow it to seek the repurchase of certain loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York State Supreme Justice O. Peter Sherwood, in an
order filed today, granted Goldman Sachs&#8217;s motion to dismiss
three counts, including one for fraudulent inducement, while
denying the New York-based investment bank&#8217;s motion to dismiss
three other claims for breach of contract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;CIFG rightly contends that it provided enough support for
the claimed breaches by providing a statistical sampling with
documentation demonstrating the pervasive nature of the
collective breaches in the underlying loans,&#8221; Sherwood said in
the order. &#8220;The complaint need not make specific
representations as to each of the individual loans.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sherwood also granted a motion by Buffalo-based MT Bank
Corp. (MTB) to remove it as a defendant in the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Considering Options &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Obviously, we&#8217;re disappointed that the court dismissed
the fraud charge, but we&#8217;ll consider our options going
forward,&#8221; David Berger, a lawyer for CIFG, said in a phone
interview. The insurer&#8217;s lawyers were still reviewing the ruling
and hadn&#8217;t decided whether to appeal, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment on the ruling in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is CIFG Assurance North America Inc. v. Goldman,
Sachs  Co., 652286/2011, New York Supreme Court, New York
County (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks fell, sending the Standard
 Poor&#8217;s 500 Index down a second day, amid disappointing service
industries data and as investors awaited tomorrow&#8217;s jobs report
to gauge the pace of growth at the world&#8217;s largest economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodity and technology shares fell the most among 10 SP
500 groups as Alcoa (AA) Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) slid at least
1.5 percent. General Motors Co. (GM) sank 2.4 percent after earnings
tumbled 61 percent. Target Corp. (TGT) lost 2.5 percent as April sales
missed projections. Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. (GMCR) plunged
48 percent as profit will be less than it expected. Carlyle
Group LP advanced 0.2 percent in its first day of trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 retreated 0.8 percent to 1,391.57 at 4 p.m. New
York time, dropping 1 percent in two days. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average declined 61.98 points, or 0.5 percent, to
13,206.59. The Russell 2000 Index (RTY) of small companies decreased
1.5 percent to 806.59. About 6.9 billion shares changed hands on
U.S. exchanges, or 3.8 percent above the three-month average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a bump in the road,&#8221; said Jeffrey Saut, chief
investment strategist at Raymond James  Associates in St.
Petersburg, Florida. His firm oversees more than $300 billion.
&#8220;The economic data has turned softer. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised
to see the jobs report tomorrow disappoint. All that will do is
allow the market to work off its overbought condition.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two-day drop in stocks, which pulled the Dow down from
a four-year high, came as concern about the economy grew. A
measure of forecasting accuracy shows economic data have been
worse than predicted. The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index is
at minus 24.20, the lowest since September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;160,000 Jobs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities fell today as service industries grew at a slower
pace than projected in April, a sign the largest part of the
economy may struggle to accelerate. The report overshadowed data
showing that jobless claims fell to 365,000 in the week ended
April 28, a one-month low. The Labor Department may say tomorrow
that the U.S. added 160,000 jobs in April, compared with a gain
of 120,000 the previous month, according to a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The jobless claims are good,&#8221; Philip Orlando, the New
York-based chief equity strategist at Federated Investors Inc.,
which oversees about $370 billion, said in a phone interview.
&#8220;This gives us the read-through that May&#8217;s jobs numbers are
likely going to be better. Yet tomorrow&#8217;s report will probably
still be consistent with this temporary soft patch.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concern about growth also intensified after European
Central Bank President Mario Draghi said the economic outlook
has worsened, adding that policy makers didn&#8217;t discuss cutting
the benchmark rate below its current record low of 1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Earnings Season &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s decline pared the 2012 rally in the SP 500 (SPX) to 11
percent. Investors bought stocks this year on better-than-
estimated profits. About 71 percent of SP 500 companies that
reported results since the start of the earnings season have
beaten projections, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight out of 10 groups in the SP 500 retreated today as
commodity shares slumped at least 1.1 percent. The Morgan
Stanley Cyclical Index of companies most-tied to the economy
slid 1.5 percent. Alcoa dropped 1.5 percent to $9.58. Hewlett-
Packard decreased 3.1 percent, the most in the Dow average, to
$24.48. Bank of America Corp. (BAC) lost 2 percent to $8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM sank 2.4 percent to $22.37. Profit at the largest
automaker was affected by widening losses in Europe. The results
resemble Ford Motor Co. (F)&#8217;s profit as North American income was
countered by losses in Europe, as well as a higher tax rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green Mountain plunged 48 percent, the biggest decline
ever, to $25.87. It&#8217;s seeing more competition from private-label
capsules that fit into Keurig machines and from Starbucks Corp. (SBUX),
which plans to sell its own single-serve brewer later this year.
The company has introduced the Vue coffee machine to help combat
rivals when the main patents for its K-Cups expire in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Retailers Slump &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retailers in the SP 500 lost 0.9 percent after companies
including Target and Macy&#8217;s Inc. (M) posted April same-store sales
that trailed analysts&#8217; estimates as an earlier Easter holiday
pulled sales into March and cooler weather cut mall traffic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Target, the second-biggest U.S. discount chain, slid 2.5
percent to $56.55. Macy&#8217;s, the second-biggest U.S. department-
store chain, rose 0.7 percent to $41.55. Gap Inc. (GPS), the largest
U.S. apparel chain, slumped 1.6 percent to $28.67. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) tumbled 10 percent, the most in
the SP 500, to $54.81. The second-biggest U.S. life insurer
swung to a first-quarter loss as the value of the company&#8217;s
derivative contracts fell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V) slid 4.7 percent to $116.41. The world&#8217;s biggest
payments network disclosed a U.S. antitrust probe into its
pricing and strategy for debit-card transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Facebook&#8217;s IPO &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc. (FB), the most popular social-networking site, is
seeking as much as $11.8 billion in its initial public offering,
the largest on record for an Internet company. About 337.4
million shares are being sold at $28 to $35 each. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2004 and led by 27-year-old Chief Executive
Officer Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook has amassed more than 900
million users and reported a 24-fold increase in sales over the
past four years. The company&#8217;s popularity as a tool for staying
connected online will spur demand for the stock, even as some
investors steer clear of a valuation they deem too high, said
Francis Gaskins, president of researcher IPOdesktop.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some people will buy Facebook stock no matter what --
they&#8217;ll just buy it,&#8221; said Gaskins, who is based in Marina Del
Rey, California. &#8220;There&#8217;s going to be an initial push of
enthusiasm and money, but ultimately, in a year or so, it will
come down to valuation metrics. It has to.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlyle Group (CG) rose 0.2 percent to $22.05, trimming a gain
of 2.1 percent. It raised $671 million by selling 30.5 million
shares at $22 each, according to a statement yesterday. The
price for Carlyle, which had offered the shares for $23 to $25,
represents a 65 percent discount to rival Blackstone (BX) Group LP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hard to Predict &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In pricing its IPO, Carlyle sought to avoid the fate of
Blackstone, Apollo Global Management LLC and other alternative
asset managers, whose stocks have tumbled in public trading.
Investors have struggled with how to value private equity firms
partly because their earnings are hard to predict, with the bulk
coming from buyout funds that sell assets at various times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Private equity firms in general struggle with initial
public offerings mainly because of the way their business is
structured, and Carlyle is no different,&#8221; said Tom Murphy, a
partner in the law firm of McDermott Will  Emery LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole Foods Market Inc. (WFM) jumped 7.6 percent to $90.69. The
largest U.S. natural-goods grocer posted profit that topped
analysts&#8217; estimates on increased demand for organic foods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) shareholders missed out on better
returns from the SP 500 by sticking with Chairman Warren Buffett after each of his last three annual meetings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2012 Gathering &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire fell 2.4 percent from the firm&#8217;s April 30, 2011,
meeting through yesterday, compared with the 2.8 percent advance
in the SP 500. This year&#8217;s gathering, planned for May 5 in
Omaha, Nebraska, concludes three years in which Berkshire
climbed about 32 percent, trailing the SP 500&#8217;s gain of around
60 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett, 81, is seeking to reassure investors that the $200
billion company he built over 42 years as chief executive
officer is positioned to thrive after his eventual departure.
Growth slowed in the last 15 years as Buffett, a former hedge
fund manager, directed Berkshire&#8217;s earnings toward takeovers in
industries like machine tools, power production and railroads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re very steady, but they&#8217;re not necessarily fast
growers,&#8221; Cliff Gallant, an analyst at KBW Inc., said about
Berkshire operating units. A &#8220;lack of clarity&#8221; about Buffett&#8217;s
successor may also be weighing on the stock, Gallant said. He
rates Berkshire &#8220;outperform.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the largest software

the addition of Seagate Technology Plc (STX) Chief Executive Officer
Stephen Luczo, whose expertise includes finance and data
storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luczo has been CEO of the world&#8217;s largest maker of disk-

Washington-based Microsoft said in a statement. He has also
joined the audit committee. Existing board member John Thompson
joined the compensation committee, replacing Netflix Inc. (NFLX) CEO
Reed Hastings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luczo brings experience in helping companies store and

managing director at investment banking firm Bear Stearns  Co.,
Microsoft said. The appointment follows the February appointment
of Thompson, the former chairman and chief executive officer at
Symantec Corp. (SYMC) That added security expertise as the company aims

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s cleanup of its 22-
inch North Line that leaked 1,900 barrels of oil in Louisiana
April 28 is likely to take another two to three weeks, the
parish sheriff said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It may have been a pipe failure,&#8221; said Beauregard
&#8220;Bud&#8221; Torres, sheriff of Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana.
&#8220;Some of these pipelines have been in existence as long as 50
years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon is excavating at the point of the rupture, Torres
said. He said 70 to 100 people are at work on the cleanup near
Torbert, Louisiana, 20 miles (32 kilometers) west of Baton
Rouge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Responders are making significant progress as cleanup
operations continue,&#8221; Rachael Moore, a spokeswoman for Exxon in
Fairfax, Virginia, said in an e-mail today. &#8220;We are working
cooperatively with federal, state and local regulatory
agencies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pipeline carries oil from the Gulf Coast to refineries
that can process more than 700,000 barrels a day and to Sunoco
Logistics Partners LP&#8217;s Mid-Valley Pipeline, which moves crude
from Louisiana to Ohio, according to Exxon&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delek US Holdings Inc. (DK) cut runs at its El Dorado, Arkansas,
refinery to 55,000 barrels a day, or about 69 percent of
capacity, after the pipeline was shut, Chief Financial Officer
Mark Cox said on a conference call today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Joe Carroll" date="May 03, 2012  3:12 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-03/exxon-says-epa-seeking-fines-for-west-virginia-water-pollution.html"><headline>Exxon Says EPA Seeking Fines for West Virginia Water Pollution</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) said it expects the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to seek fines in excees of
$100,000 for alleged water pollution at three well sites in West
Virginia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incidents involved Exxon&#8217;s XTO Energy unit, according
to a public filing today. The agency issued three administrative
orders to the company between June 23 and Feb. 29, according to
the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Alex Wayne" date="May 03, 2012  2:01 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-03/pfizer-letting-u-s-test-failed-compounds-on-new-illnesses-1-.html"><headline>Pfizer, Lilly Help U.S. Test Failed Drugs for New Illness</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;More than 20 compounds that Pfizer
Inc. (PFE), Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY) and AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) failed to turn into
drugs will be tested by U.S.-sponsored scientists in a $20
million program to see if they&#8217;ll work against ailments they
weren&#8217;t aimed at previously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the compounds are effective, the time to market will be
shorter and the drugmakers, who retain ownership of the
compounds, will share profits with researchers. Traditionally,
companies spend about $2 billion and take 14 years to develop
therapies, a so-called valley-of-death commitment that&#8217;s made
drugmakers move cautiously in deciding which illness to target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joint program, a first for the National Institutes of
Health, is designed to lessen drugmakers&#8217; risk, funded by $575
million in President Barack Obama&#8217;s fiscal 2013 budget. The
agency cited the HIV treatment AZT, created from failed attempts
to treat cancer, in explaining the partnership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We need to generate more of these success stories in a
more systematic manner,&#8221; NIH director Francis Collins said
during a news conference announcing the agreements.. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compounds that New York-based Pfizer, the world&#8217;s
largest drugmaker, Indianapolis-based Lilly and London-based
AstraZeneca will make available already have been found safe in
humans. The drugmakers will give researchers access to the
chemicals and related data, company officials said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Just Benefits&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For us, there is just benefits, in a way,&#8221; said Jan Lundberg, executive vice president for science and technology at
Lilly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drugmakers will have to provide the compounds to
researchers, which may requiring manufacturing more of the
substances, Lundberg said today in an interview. The companies
also face costs for maintaining patents on the compounds and for
gathering and transmitting clinical data to scientists, said Don
Frail, vice president for science and new opportunities at
London-based AstraZeneca. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s not a shelf of discontinued compounds that you
can just pull one off and give to somebody,&#8221; Frail said in an
interview. Clinical supplies alone, should the compounds enter
human trials, may cost as much as $1 million, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collins said he is hopeful the work will lead to new
treatments for diseases of the central nervous system, which
have proved so difficult to attack that drug companies are
dissuaded from investing in them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Health Crises&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rod Mackenzie, a senior vice president at Pfizer, said
neurological diseases are &#8220;one of the great health crises we
face across the globe.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We need to do better there,&#8221; he said during the news
conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should the drugs prove effective against a new disease, the
companies will have the option to develop them into a marketed
product, the agency said. Taxpayers would get a financial
benefit only if an NIH scientist is a researcher on one of the
compounds. Then royalties would flow back to the U.S. agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Americans are eagerly awaiting the next generation of
cures and treatments to help them live longer and healthier
lives,&#8221; said Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, in a statement. &#8220;To accelerate our nation&#8217;s
therapeutic development process, it is essential that we forge
strong, innovative and strategic partnerships across government,
academia and industry.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom-line benefit for the public is societal, Collins
said. Diseases that don&#8217;t have treatments now may get one, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delek US Holdings Inc. (DK) cut runs at its
El Dorado, Arkansas, refinery to 69 percent of capacity after a
pipeline that supplies it was shut April 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refinery throughput has been reduced to 55,000 barrels a
day, Chief Financial Officer Mark Cox said on a conference call
from Delek&#8217;s Brentwood, Tennessee, headquarters. Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s North Line pipeline supplies El Dorado with Gulf Coast
crudes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery runs about 35,000 barrels a day of West Texas
Intermediate-linked crude from other sources, Chief Executive
Officer Uzi Yemin said on the same call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Dorado has a capacity of 80,000 barrels a day, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Delek completed the acquisition
of Lion Oil Co., which owned the El Dorado refinery, in October. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) raised its
recommendation on the debt of oil and gas driller Chesapeake
Energy Corp. (CHK) to overweight from neutral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We upgrade the senior notes to buy from hold based on
cheap valuation,&#8221; because the company can overcome liquidity
concerns, analysts at the bank led by Gregg Brody wrote in a
research note dated May 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost to protect against losses on Chesapeake&#8217;s debt
yesterday jumped to the highest since September 2009 as the
second-largest U.S. natural-gas producer, which reported an
unexpected first-quarter loss, said it may run out of money next
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chesapeake&#8217;s $1.3 billion of 6.775 percent senior unsecured
notes due March 2019 fell 3.25 cents yesterday to 95.75 cents on

&lt;p&gt;Dewey  LeBoeuf LLP, whose bank loans
are partly secured with money due from clients, told partners
they can&#8217;t have their monthly pay until they send all the bills
for their services, a person familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dewey is under orders from bankers to collect as much money
owed to the firm as possible after the departure of about 85
partners and the ouster of chairman Steven Davis, according to
another person familiar with Dewey&#8217;s finances. The banks are
reluctant to put the firm into bankruptcy as that might make it
harder to collect the bills, that person said. Both people
didn&#8217;t want to be identified because the matter wasn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By last month, the New York-based law firm had drawn about
$75 million of a $100 million credit line from banks including
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Citigroup Inc., the second person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders were considering a 120-day extension of the credit
line until a possible combination of the firm with Greenberg
Traurig LLP fell through, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The banks know that Chapter 11 will add another whole
layer of huge expense and involve years of litigation with
little gained,&#8221; said Anthony Sabino, a lawyer and professor at
the Peter J. Tobin College of Business at St. John&#8217;s University
in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Sitrick, a spokesman for Dewey, didn&#8217;t immediately
return an e-mail yesterday after regular business hours seeking
comment on the firm&#8217;s financial situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dewey was the 11th-largest U.S. law firm with 1,300 lawyers
after a merger during the 2007 recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merger discussions with law firm SNR Denton, where it would
have taken on more than 1,000 remaining Dewey lawyers, fell
apart yesterday, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people
familiar with the matter. The deal hinged on the combined law
firm&#8217;s ability to raise hundreds of millions of dollars in
financing, the newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the firm&#8217;s Manhattan offices, employees for outsourced
services have gone and Dewey&#8217;s own support staff may be
gradually dismissed as more lawyers leave for other firms, said
the first person familiar with Dewey&#8217;s situation. Contrary to
some online reports, the photocopiers are still there and the
computers are working, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 85 partners have left the U.S. firm in recent
weeks. Yesterday Jones Day announced that Ira White had joined
the firm as a partner in the New York office. He was previously
a partner in Dewey&#8217;s private equity practice and co-chairman of
the private equity transactions group, the firm said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shearman  Sterling LLP announced that New York partner
Creighton Condon has been elected senior partner for a six-year
term, succeeding Rohan S. Weerasinghe, who was recently named
general counsel at Citigroup Inc. (C) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MA lawyer Condon, a 30-year veteran of the firm, will be
the 15th senior partner in the firm&#8217;s 139-year history, the firm
said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York partner David J. Beveridge has been appointed to a
new global managing partner role. The leadership transition will
take place tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Condon, 56, is co-chairman of the global mergers and
acquisitions practice. He recently served for three years as the
European managing partner, based in London. He has served as a
member of the firm&#8217;s policy committee and senior leadership
team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Condon represents multinational corporations in
acquisitions and sales of public and private companies and in
joint ventures. His clients have included Cadbury, Citigroup,
Fenway Sports Group (owner of the Boston Red Sox and the
Liverpool Football Club), Georgia-Pacific, Royal Bank of
Scotland, Synthes, Viacom and WebMD, the firm said. Condon also
represents a number of the firm&#8217;s investment banking clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beveridge, 51, is the firm&#8217;s Americas managing partner. He
has been with Shearman  Sterling for more than 25 years and has
also served on the firm&#8217;s policy committee and senior leadership
team. A capital markets lawyer, he specializes in advising on
high-yield offerings. Beveridge represents both issuers and
underwriters in the full spectrum of debt, equity and hybrid
security offerings. He has experience with cross-border private
equity, acquisition financing, and debt restructuring
transactions, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shearman  Sterling has 20 offices in 12 countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hopson Named Managing Partner of Sidley&#8217;s Washington Office &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sidley Austin LLP named Mark D. Hopson, a member of the
firm&#8217;s management and executive committees, to the role of
managing partner of the firm&#8217;s 275-lawyer Washington office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopson succeeds Carter G. Phillips, who became co-chairman
of Sidley&#8217;s executive committee, effective May 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopson is a co-head of the firm&#8217;s white-collar practice. He
represents a range of white-collar criminal and complex civil
litigation matters. He also represents clients in connection
with a range of governmental and internal investigation matters.
Hopson will continue to maintain an active litigation practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sidley Austin has approximately 1,700 lawyers practicing in
18 U.S. and international cities, including Beijing, Brussels,
Frankfurt, Geneva, Hong Kong, London, Shanghai, Singapore,
Sydney and Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Top Drilling Regulator Bromwich Joins Goodwin Procter &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael R. Bromwich, the country&#8217;s top offshore drilling
regulator and a former inspector general for the U.S. Justice
Department, has joined Goodwin Procter LLP as a partner in its
litigation department, based in the Washington and New York
offices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a member of Goodwin&#8217;s securities litigation and white-
collar defense group, Bromwich will focus on corporate internal
investigations, compliance, monitoring and white-collar criminal
defense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most recently, Bromwich was director of the Bureau of Ocean
Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement at the U.S.
Interior Department, where he assumed leadership in the midst of
the BP oil spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He led a reorganization of the agency, developed and
implemented a new generation of drilling safety and
environmental standards, and became the Obama administration&#8217;s
chief spokesman on offshore drilling matters, Goodwin Procter
said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to his most recent public service, he was a partner
and chairman of the internal investigations, compliance and
monitoring practice group at Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver 
Jacobson LLP where he focused his practice on conducting
internal investigations, according to his new firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Inspector General from 1994 to 1999, he was responsible
for conducting independent investigations, audits, inspections
and special reviews of Justice Department personnel and
programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodwin Procter has offices in Boston, Hong Kong, London,
Los Angeles, New York, San Diego, San Francisco, Silicon Valley,
California, and Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Skadden Hires Betts From Paul Hastings for Hong Kong Share Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher  Flom LLP ranked third among
legal advisers on global equity sales last year, hired
Christopher Betts as a partner for its capital markets and
mergers team in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Betts, who had worked at Paul Hastings LLP and Freshfields
Bruckhaus Deringer LLP, is the fourth partner added in Asia in
the past seven months as part of New York-based Skadden&#8217;s
strategy to build its presence in the region for the next
decade, according to Asia head Michael Gisser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Hong Kong market is and will remain the preferred
listing destination for quality Chinese companies,&#8221; Gisser said
when asked about the increased scrutiny by regulators in the
Chinese city on arrangers of initial public offerings. Hong
Kong&#8217;s Securities and Futures Commission said last month it may
propose rules making IPO sponsors criminally liable for the
accuracy of information in prospectuses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least 14 U.S. law firms have expanded in Hong Kong since
2010 and hired lawyers who can advise on domestic law. Skadden
started the trend in 2005 by luring Dominic Tsun and Nick Norris
from London-based firms. They were both hired by Chicago-based
Kirkland  Ellis LLP last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Betts, who also previously co-led the Asia-Pacific legal
team at McKinsey  Co., said while tougher IPO rules in Hong
Kong may deter smaller value listings, the pipeline of work
remains strong including the listing in Hong Kong of overseas
acquisitions by Chinese state-owned enterprises. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Department of Justice Lawyer Returns to Arnold  Porter &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arnold  Porter LLP announced that Robert N. Weiner has
rejoined the firm as a partner in the Washington office, after
serving as associate deputy attorney general at the U.S. Justice
Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weiner spent the last two years managing a broad docket of
work, including overseeing the defense of the new health-care
law. He also handled sensitive government-to-government
negotiations on bank secrecy among other legal and policy
issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to his government position, Weiner led the firm&#8217;s
litigation and business litigation practice. He has experience
as a trial lawyer and appellate advocate in criminal and civil
cases including in product liability and toxic tort cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weiner also served as senior counsel in the White House
Counsel&#8217;s Office during the Clinton administration from 1997 to
1998. He was president of the District of Columbia Bar from 1995
to 1996. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arnold  Porter has more than 800 lawyers with offices in
Brussels, Denver, London, Los Angeles, New York, Northern
Virginia, San Francisco, Silicon Valley, California, and
Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Former FDA Counsel Tave Joins Gibson Dunn in Washington &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gibson, Dunn  Crutcher LLP announced that Steven J. Tave
has joined the firm&#8217;s Washington office as of counsel. Tave was
the associate chief counsel for enforcement in the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration&#8217;s Office of Chief Counsel from 2007 to 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Gibson Dunn, Tave will focus his practice on FDA and
health-care compliance, enforcement and litigation with regard
to pharmaceutical and medical device issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his former position, Tave worked closely with the FDA&#8217;s
office of criminal investigations, the Justice Department and
other federal and state agencies as the lead FDA attorney
responsible for investigating, prosecuting and resolving
criminal enforcement actions and related civil False Claims Act
whistle-blower cases involving drugs, medical devices and
biological products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gibson Dunn has more than 1,000 lawyers and 17 offices,
including Brussels, Dallas, Denver, Dubai, Hong Kong, London,
Los Angeles, Munich, New York, Paris, San Francisco, Sao Paulo,
Singapore, Washington and Century City, Palo Alto and Orange
County, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;McDermott Expands Paris Office With Regulatory Partner &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sabine Nauges joined McDermott Will  Emery LLP as a
partner in the Paris office, where she will be in charge of the

&lt;p&gt;Nauges&#8217;s practice focuses on administrative and regulatory
law, including in the sectors of telecommunications, health and
energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hire comes during a period of strategic growth in
Europe for McDermott, the firm said in a statement. In recent
months, McDermott has expanded its international transactional

strategic alliance with MWE China Law Offices in Shanghai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cooley Hires Corporate and Securities Litigator Partners &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooley LLP hired two new partners May 1, former Latham 
Watkins LLP corporate and capital markets lawyer Andrew S.
&#8220;Drew&#8221; Williamson and former Dewey  LeBoeuf LLP securities
litigator Lyle Roberts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Williamson joined Cooley as a partner in the San Francisco
office, after six years as a partner at Latham. His corporate
practice focuses on representing investment banks and issuers in
the technology, clean technology and life sciences sectors, for
capital markets and mergers and acquisitions work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roberts joined the firm&#8217;s Washington office as a partner in
its securities litigation practice group. His practice focuses
on the defense of public corporations and individuals in class
actions, derivative cases, MA litigation and Securities and
Exchange Commission enforcement actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooley has 650 attorneys in Palo Alto, California; New
York; San Diego; San Francisco; Reston, Virginia; Broomfield,
Colorado; Washington; Boston and Seattle. The firm also has an

&lt;h2&gt;Mayer Brown Expands Houston Corporate and Securities Practice &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayer Brown LLP has added Kirk Tucker to the firm&#8217;s Houston
office as a partner in the corporate and securities practice. He
was previously a partner with Thompson  Knight LLP in Houston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tucker concentrates his practice on corporate and
securities matters, with a particular focus on the upstream oil
and gas sector. He represents clients on mergers, acquisitions
and dispositions of businesses; venture capital and subsequent
financings; public offerings and private placements of equity
and debt securities; and SEC reporting, corporate governance,
and compliance with securities laws and exchange rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayer Brown LLP has 20 offices worldwide in the Americas,
Asia and Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Litigation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yoo Entitled to Immunity From Padilla Lawsuit, Court Rules &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Yoo, an ex-U.S. Justice Department attorney who wrote
memos justifying harsh interrogations of suspected terrorists,
is entitled to qualified immunity from a lawsuit brought by an
ex-detainee, a federal appeals court ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gibson, Dunn  Crutcher LLP&#8217;s Miguel Estrada represented
Yoo, a former George W. Bush administration lawyer, who was sued
in 2008 by Jose Padilla. Padilla was detained for three years in
the U.S. as an enemy combatant and convicted of supporting
terrorists and conspiring to commit murder. Padilla, who claims
he was subjected to physical abuse, said Yoo was responsible for
violating his constitutional rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco said yesterday
that it wasn&#8217;t clear at the time Yoo acted that Padilla was
entitled to the same constitutional protections as an ordinary
convicted prisoner. It also &#8220;was not clearly established in
2001-03&#8221; that Padilla&#8217;s alleged treatment was torture, the
court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling &#8220;confirms that this litigation has been
baseless from the outset,&#8221; said Estrada. &#8220;For several years,
Padilla and his attorneys have been harassing the government
officials he believes to have been responsible for his detention
and ultimately conviction as a terrorist.&#160;He has now lost before
two separate courts of appeals, and will need to find a new
hobby for his remaining time in prison.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower-court case is Padilla v. Yoo, 08-00035, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accretive Health Lawyer Says Minnesota Report Got &#8216;Facts&#8217; Wrong &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Accretive Health Inc. (AH) lawyer claimed Minnesota Attorney
General Lori Swanson negotiated in bad faith before suing the
company in January and disclosed its confidential data in an
April 24 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The AG&#8217;s office ignored its responsibility to get the
facts straight,&#8221; outside counsel Andrew B. Clubok, a partner in
the Chicago-based law firm Kirkland  Ellis LLP said in his
seven-page letter yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accretive shares fell almost 42 percent one day after
Swanson issued her six-part report critical of the Chicago-based
company&#8217;s collections practices. Her federal lawsuit accused
Accretive of breaching patient privacy laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company on April 30 asked U.S. District Judge Richard H. Kyle in St. Paul, Minnesota, to dismiss the case, calling it
&#8220;factually baseless and legally indefensible.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clubok alleged that his client only provided data he said
was relied upon by Swanson in her April 24 report, &#8220;in order to
explore a good-faith resolution&#8221; to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her initial and amended federal court complaints,
Swanson challenged the company&#8217;s work for Minnesota-based
Fairview Health Services and North Memorial Health Care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her subsequent report, she alleged that Accretive
improperly posted debt collectors in hospital emergency rooms
and patient bedsides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clubok said his client rejected Swanson&#8217;s insinuation that
it was an &#8220;uber debt collector,&#8221; using a German word that
translates to &#8220;super,&#8221; when individual collections comprise
less than 10 percent of Accretive&#8217;s business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also accused Swanson of pressuring Accretive and
Fairview to end it their &#8220;revenue cycle agreement.&#8221; Accretive
said on April 27 that the seven-hospital chain did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryan Davenport, a Fairview spokesman, said company
officials hadn&#8217;t yet seen the Accretive attorney&#8217;s letter and
couldn&#8217;t comment on it. Fairview&#8217;s headquarters are in
Minneapolis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Wogsland, a spokesman for Swanson, said in a
statement that the attorney general&#8217;s report -- formally called
a compliance review -- is &#8220;accurate and documented by the
facts.&#8221; Accretive&#8217;s emergency room and bedside collections
practices were related by hospital patients, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is an old saying among lawyers,&#8221; Wogsland said,
&#8220;&#8216;If the facts aren&#8217;t on your side, talk about the law. If the
law&#8217;s not on your side, talk about the facts. And if you don&#8217;t
have either on your side, pound the table and blame someone
else.&#8217; That&#8217;s what&#8217;s going on here.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attorney general&#8217;s case is State of Minnesota v.
Accretive Health Inc., 12-cv-00145, U.S. District Court for
Minnesota (St. Paul). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects shares trading in final paragraph.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technicolor said it plans to raise as
much as 158 million euros in capital through a sale of stock to
shareholders and with JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) boosting its stake in
the producer of film-making products and technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which owns 1 percent of Technicolor, plans to buy
a stake through its One Equity Partners (NBPE) arm, and will own
between 25 percent and 29.96 percent of Technicolor, the Paris-
based company said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The capital increase we are planning will provide the
company with a stronger financial structure and a stable
shareholder base to implement its growth strategy,&#8221; Technicolor
Chief Executive Officer Frederic Rose said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two-step capital-raising exercise will include a sale
of shares to a JPMorgan-linked investment vehicle for 1.60 euros
a shares and a rights offer, or a sale of stock to existing
shareholders, at 1.56 euros a shares. JPMorgan&#8217;s stake will be
determined by the level of participation in the rights offer by
Technicolor&#8217;s shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technicolor shares closed 13 percent higher at 1.599 euros
on April 30. The stock was suspended from trading yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s (PFE) Lyrica, approved for use
in fibromyalgia, didn&#8217;t work to control painful nerve damage
from diabetes in one study, and the company halted a second
trial in nerve-damaged HIV patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyrica, with sales of $3.7 billion last year, didn&#8217;t
significantly lessen the pain of diabetes patients with nerve
damage who were switched to the drug after another treatment
failed, New York-based Pfizer said. The company also halted a
trial for HIV patients, after an interim analysis showed no
difference between Lyrica and a placebo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before today&#8217;s results investors and analysts had
assumed Lyrica sales were near their peak, said Les Funtleyder,
a portfolio manager at Miller Tabak  Co. whose fund owns Pfizer
shares. The drug also is approved for use in pain after
shingles, partial-onset seizures in adults with epilepsy, and
diabetic nerve pain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The sense is Lyrica has gone about as far as it can go,&#8221;
Funtleyder said. &#8220;Maybe it is a slight loss of upside, but we
are not talking about a major hit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, declined less than 1
percent to $22.38 at the close of New York trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 16 percent of people with diabetes develop pain and
numbness from nerve damage caused by high blood-sugar levels,
according to an April 2011 report from the American Academy of
Neurology. About a third of HIV patients have nerve damage, and
some of these people experience pain, according to the
University of Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said the trial in HIV patients wasn&#8217;t ended for
safety reasons. In the diabetes study, the most common adverse
events were fluid retention, dizziness, sleepiness and upper
respiratory tract infection, which are known side effects of the
drug, according to the company&#8217;s statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4), Brazil&#8217;s
state-controlled oil producer, fell to the lowest in more than
six months after a production halt by its partner Chevron Corp. (CVX)
contributed the lowest domestic output since August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petrobras fell 5.1 percent to 20.31 reais at 3:54 p.m. in
Sao Paulo. Earlier it fell to 20.20 reais, the lowest since Oct.
26. Petrobras is down 3.5 percent for the year, compared with a
7.9 percent gain in the benchmark stock index. Oil fell below
$100 today in New York for the first time since February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil production in Brazil fell to 1.99 million barrels a day
in March, the lowest level in eight months, after Petrobras shut
three production platforms for maintenance and Chevron suspended
output at the Frade field to study recent oil leaks, Petrobras
said in an e-mailed statement today. Petrobras&#8217;s output rose at
the slowest pace since 2007 last year on equipment delays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petrobras has a 30 percent stake in Frade, which was
producing about 60,000 barrels a day before the halt on March
18. Chevron is studying the geology of the Frade field in deep
waters of the Campos Basin to determine the causes of two oil
spills since November. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Marvel&#8217;s The Avengers,&#8221; Walt Disney
Co. (DIS)&#8217;s new superhero movie, took in $18.7 million in midnight
sales at U.S. and Canadian theaters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debut was the eighth-best among top films for midnight
openings, Hollywood.com Box-Office said today in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie, featuring Marvel superheros, including &#8220;Iron
Man,&#8221; &#8220;Thor&#8221; and &#8220;Captain America,&#8221; &#8220;The Avengers,&#8221; is
forecast to generate as much as $170 million in weekend sales, a
figure that would break the record of $169.2 million set last
year by the final &#8220;Harry Potter&#8221; movie. The film already has
taken in $304 million outside the U.S. and Canada, Disney said
in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The midnight sales include $1.31 million from sold-out
performances on 273 Imax screens, Paul Pflug, a Principal
Communications Group spokesman for Imax Corp. (IMAX), said in an e-
mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the film, the superheros unite to battle an army led by
the evil Norse god Loki. The movie is benefiting from the
popularity of previous films based on the characters, including
Robert Downey Jr.&#8217;s two &#8220;Iron Man&#8221; movies and last year&#8217;s
&#8220;Thor,&#8221; which also featured Loki. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Christine Harper" date="May 04, 2012 12:09 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-04/goldman-sachs-said-to-prepare-trading-system-for-corporate-bonds.html"><headline>Goldman Said to Plan Trading System for Corporate Bonds</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will start an
electronic trading system for corporate bonds this month as the
fifth-biggest U.S. bank adapts to regulatory changes and
competition, according to a person familiar with the plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The platform, called GSessions, has been under development
for a year, said the person, who declined to be identified
because the New York-based firm isn&#8217;t making details public yet.
The Wall Street Journal reported the initiative late yesterday
on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move comes three weeks after BlackRock Inc. (BLK), the
world&#8217;s largest money manager, said it was planning its own
bond-trading platform called Aladdin Trading Network that would
allow clients to bypass Wall Street firms such as Goldman Sachs.
Last year, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s revenue from market making and
principal investments in credit, including corporate debt and
derivatives, fell to $2.72 billion from $8.68 billion in 2010,
according to a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The profitability of Wall Street firms is being challenged
by regulations requiring that they hold more capital as a buffer
against potential losses from assets such as corporate debt. A
U.S. law that seeks to prohibit federally insured banks from
making bets with their own money may also hinder lenders&#8217;
ability to commit money to buy securities from clients,
according to analysts including Brad Hintz at Sanford C.
Bernstein  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fixed Income &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In presentations over the past two years, Goldman Sachs
executives have said the firm succeeded in developing electronic
trading capabilities in the stock and currency markets and were
also preparing for a higher percentage of fixed-income trading
becoming computerized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Connectivity with clients and what we call owning the
desktop is going to be very, very important,&#8221; Chief Financial
Officer David A. Viniar said in a presentation in February 2011.
&#8220;Having those capabilities, having first-mover advantage, we
think is going to be key coming out after the new regulations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GSessions will start by offering two five-minute trading
sessions a day, one in an investment-grade bond and another in a
high-yield, high-risk security, the person said. Speculative-
grade, or junk, bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s Investors
Service and lower than BBB- at Standard  Poor&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of each session, Goldman Sachs will post a bid
and offer price and notify clients of the maximum amount of
liquidity the firm is willing to provide to fill orders,
according to the person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Acting as Counterparty &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than matching trades between clients, Goldman Sachs
will act as the counterparty to all trades and collect the
spread, or difference, between the bid and offer prices, the
person said. That gap will be lower than what Goldman Sachs
earns on non-computerized trades, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock, based in New York, said on April 12 that it was
creating Aladdin Trading Network to lower trading costs for
customers. BlackRock is awaiting approval from the Securities
and Exchange Commission for its platform. Brian Beades, a
spokesman for BlackRock in New York, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (MKTX)&#8217;s electronic trading system for
U.S. and European investment-grade, emerging markets and other
types of bonds said last month that it had a record $58.7
billion of transactions during March. Other electronic trading
systems for fixed income include Tradeweb Markets LLC and
Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News, which also
provides news and information to the financial community. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. asked a

&#8220;hundreds of millions of dollars&#8221; might be gained for the

&lt;p&gt;Butamax Advanced Biofuels LLC asked
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to reexamine a disputed
patent owned by Gevo Inc. (GEVO), the U.S. biotechnology company backed
by the oil refiner Total SA and the specialty chemicals maker
Lanxess AG. (LXS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A joint venture of BP Plc (BP/) and DuPont Co., Butamax said
Gevo&#8217;s patent may be invalid because it&#8217;s based on technology
that &#8220;was well known at the time the patent was filed,&#8221;
according to a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies have been sparring since January 2011 over
patent rights for systems that convert corn and non-food crops
into isobutanol. The Patent Office granted an earlier Butamax
request on March 23 to reexamine another Gevo patent, according
to the statement. Patent reexaminations take about three years
on average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Patent Office is also reviewing two Butamax patents at
Gevo&#8217;s request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isobutanol is blended with gasoline or refined into
specialty chemicals or jet fuel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pfizer Letting U.S. Test Failed Compounds on New Illnesses &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 20 compounds that Pfizer Inc. (PFE), Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY)
and AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) failed to turn into drugs will be tested by
U.S.-sponsored scientists in a $20 million program to see if
they&#8217;ll work against ailments they weren&#8217;t aimed at previously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they do, the time to market will be shorter and the
drugmakers, who retain ownership of the compounds, will share
profits with the researchers, who keep intellectual property
rights. Traditionally, companies spend about $2 billion and take
14 years to develop therapies, a so-called &#8220;valley-of-death&#8221;
commitment that&#8217;s stalled progress as drugmakers move cautiously
in deciding which illness to target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joint program, a first for the National Institutes of
Health, is designed to lessen their risk, funded by
$575 million in President Barack Obama&#8217;s fiscal 2013 budget. The
agency cited the HIV treatment AZT, created from failed attempts
to treat cancer, in explaining the partnership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We need to generate more of these success stories in a
more systematic manner,&#8221; NIH director Francis Collins said
during a news conference announcing the agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compounds New York-based Pfizer, Lilly, based in
Indianapolis, and London-based AstraZeneca will make available
have already been shown to be safe in humans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugmakers will give researchers access to the
chemicals and related data, the NIH said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Americans are eagerly awaiting the next generation of
cures and treatments to help them live longer and healthier
lives,&#8221; Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius
said in the statement. &#8220;To accelerate our nation&#8217;s therapeutic
development process, it is essential that we forge strong,
innovative and strategic partnerships across government,
academia and industry.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should the drugs prove effective against a new disease, the
companies will have the option to develop them into a marketed
product, the agency said. Taxpayers would get a financial
benefit only if an NIH scientist is a researcher on one of the
compounds. Then there would be a flow of royalties back to the
federal agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom-line benefit for the public is societal, Collins
said. Diseases that don&#8217;t have treatments now may get one, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bogart Heirs Vie With Burberry Over Use of &#8216;Casablanca&#8217; Coat &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burberry Group Plc (BRBY) and heirs of Humphrey Bogart have filed
lawsuits against each other over an image of the late actor
wearing a Burberry trench coat in the film &#8220;Casablanca.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burberry asked a federal court to declare that its use of
Bogart&#8217;s name and image in social media doesn&#8217;t infringe Bogart
LLC&#8217;s trademark rights or rights of publicity, it said in a
complaint filed May 2 in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bogart LLC followed that action by filing a trademark-
infringement complaint yesterday in California state court in
Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The London-based fashion company said it licensed from
photo agency Corbis an image of Bogart wearing the trench coat
in the final scene of the 1942 film. The picture was used in a
Burberry historical timeline to indicate the influence of the
brand, according to the complaint. Burberry said the image
wasn&#8217;t used to sell merchandise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Defendant is attempting to exert and assert against
Burberry rights which it does not possess,&#8221; Burberry said in
its complaint. The company said its reference to Bogart in the
timeline is protected under the First Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burberry said Bogart LLC contacted it in April and ordered
it to cease using the image. Bogart LLC then contacted the
company at least two other times and &#8220;made a significant
monetary demand,&#8221; Burberry said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burberry&#8217;s &#8220;use of Bogart intellectual property rights in
their marketing and promotion materials and in products were for
the express purpose of commercially linking their Burberry brand
and products to the persona and character of Humphrey Bogart in
the minds of defendants&#8217; potential and actual customers,&#8221;
Bogart LLC said in its complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bogart LLC, according to a news release, is majority-owned
by the children of Bogart and actress Lauren Bacall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is such an incredibly disappointing and
disrespectful action by Burberry,&#8221; Stephen Bogart, the son of
the late actor, said in the release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bogart, who died in 1957 of cancer, was nominated for an
Academy Award for his role as Rick Blaine, an expatriate
nightclub owner, in &#8220;Casablanca.&#8221; The film won the Academy
Award for Best Picture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal case is Burberry Ltd. v. Bogart LLC, 12-3491,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).
The state case is Bogart LLC v. Burberry Group, BC483967,
Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Google&#8217;s Android Profit and Loss Figures Questioned by Judge &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s disclosure that its Android software made a
small profit in recent years was questioned by the judge
overseeing a trial of Oracle Corp. (ORCL)&#8217;s claims that the smartphone
operating system infringes its copyrights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco said a
Google document turned over to the Redwood City, California-
based database maker in the intellectual property dispute
suggested the search engine provider was &#8220;losing money&#8221; at one
point and made a &#8220;small profit&#8221; for the second half of 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It comes out to their losing money,&#8221; Alsup said, looking
at the document, which is sealed from public view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle&#8217;s attorneys say Google executives have been unable
to confirm the figures. After hearing arguments from lawyers for
both companies at a hearing yesterday, Alsup ordered Google to
produce documents that back up the figures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s unclear to me that anyone can vouch for these
numbers,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A jury is deliberating whether Mountain View, California-
based Google infringed Oracle&#8217;s copyrights for the Java
programming language, which Google used to develop Android,
introduced in 2007 and now running on 300 million devices. If
Google is found to have infringed, damages would be partly based
on Android&#8217;s profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim Prosser, a Google spokesman, didn&#8217;t immediately return
a voice-mail message seeking comment on the figures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google doesn&#8217;t disclose revenue for Android. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Oracle v. Google, 10-3561, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Google Argues for Dismissal of Authors&#8217; Book-Scan Lawsuit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. asked a judge to dismiss a lawsuit by an
organization representing authors over the search-engine
company&#8217;s digital scanning of millions of books, saying the
group can&#8217;t represent the owners of the books&#8217; copyrights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Circuit Judge Denny Chin in Manhattan heard arguments
yesterday on motions by Google to deny the authors the right to
proceed as a class and to dismiss the organization&#8217;s case. Chin
last year rejected a $125 million settlement between the two
sides and the parties have been unable to reach a new agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It would be a terrible burden on the court if each
individual author was forced to litigate,&#8221; Joanne Zack, a
lawyer for the Authors Guild, told the judge. &#8220;A class action
is superior.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google announced in 2004 a plan to digitally scan books
from public and university libraries to provide short snippets
of text to people who use its Internet search engine. The
Authors Guild, individual authors and publishing companies sued
in 2005, claiming Mountain View, California-based Google hadn&#8217;t
sought authorization from the owners of the works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google said in court papers that because the guild doesn&#8217;t
claim to own the copyrights at issue, it can&#8217;t sue on behalf of
authors. Google&#8217;s lawyer said yesterday that the company&#8217;s
scanning project has been an &#8220;economic benefit&#8221; to many
authors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zack, the authors&#8217; lawyer, told the judge there was &#8220;no
evidence of a conflict among class members on financial
benefits.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are fully prepared to litigate this case against the
three individual plaintiffs,&#8221; Durie said in court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge said he would rule later on the motions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors have asked for a jury trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A related lawsuit was brought by several organizations
representing visual artists. Chin also will consider a motion by
Google to dismiss their case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google said it&#8217;s still in talks about a possible settlement
with book publishers including McGraw Hill Cos., (MHP) Simon 
Schuster Inc. and John Wiley  Sons Inc. (JW/A) Yesterday&#8217;s hearing
didn&#8217;t involve the publishers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re hopeful we can reach agreement with the
publishers,&#8221; Megan Lamb, a Google spokeswoman, said after the
hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors&#8217; case is Authors Guild v. Google, 05-08136; the
visual artists&#8217; case is American Society of Media Photographers
v. Google, 10-02977; U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adult Film Company Told It Reached Too Far in Copyright Suit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal magistrate judge in New York came down hard on a
maker of adult films who sued a number of anonymous defendants
for using the BitTorrent protocol to download and share the
films without authorization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his May 1 order, U.S. Magistrate Judge Gary R. Brown
said the plaintiffs &#8220;improperly avoided&#8221; more than $25,000 in
filing fees by treating the defendants as a group rather than
individuals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that if reported estimates that hundreds of
thousands of such defendants have been sued nationally,
plaintiffs in similar cases &#8220;may be evading millions of dollars
in filing fees annually. Nationwide these plaintiffs have
availed themselves of the resources of the court system on a
scale rarely seen. It seems improper that they should profit
without paying statutorily required fees.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also questioned the inclusion of some defendants. One of
them is &#8220;an octogenarian with neither the wherewithal nor the
interest&#8221; in using BitTorrent. Another alleged defendant was
away from his home computer and at work at the time the illegal
downloading occurred, and a third defendant said that
downloading the film was contrary to her &#8220;religious, moral,
ethical and personal views.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He denied the plaintiffs the broad early discovery they
sought and barred them from obtaining the defendants&#8217; e-mail
addresses or phone numbers. The potential defendants must be
provided a copy of the subpoena and given an opportunity to
obtain counsel, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown also recommended that the judges in his district tell
plaintiffs that any future cases they file in this judicial
district be a separate action against each defendant &#8220;so as to
avoid unfair outcomes, improper joinder and waste of judicial
resources and to ensure the proper payment of filing fees.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is K-Beech v. John Does 1-37, 2:11-cv-03995, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of New York (Central Islip). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever wonder what the Incredible Hulk
smells like? Try Indian sandalwood, musk and sharp cedar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s more of an earthy fragrance,&#8221; said Andrew Levine,
chief executive officer of Jads International LLC, the Hunt
Valley, Maryland-based marketer that signed on to produce a line
of &#8220;Avengers&#8221; scents, including Smash, a cologne based on the
green superhero. &#8220;You have to mimic the character.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dozens of companies are tying in with &#8220;Marvel&#8217;s The
Avengers,&#8221; the Walt Disney Co. (DIS) action film opening today in the
U.S. With its Captain America character dating back to World War
II, &#8220;The Avengers&#8221; has an unusually broad appeal, attracting
licensing and sponsorship deals that go well beyond toys,
including ones for hotels, fragrances and luxury cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Searching for revenue beyond the box office has been a big
part of the strategy at Disney, where the Marvel division
generated $6 billion in retail merchandise sales last year,
according to License! Global magazine. Disney&#8217;s consumer
products division produced operating income of $816 million in
2011, more than the $618 million brought in by the company&#8217;s
original business, its film studio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The superhero transcends age, gender and ethnicity,&#8221;
said Robin Korman, head of loyalty marketing at hotelier Wyndham
Worldwide Corp. (WYN), which is offering a ticket giveaway for guests.
&#8220;It really is one of those genres that&#8217;s universally
embraced.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film features cars from Acura, Honda Motor Co.&#8217;s luxury
division, including customized versions of the MDX sport-utility
vehicle, which starts at $43,000, and an NSX concept car driven
by Robert Downey Jr.&#8217;s &#8220;Iron Man&#8221; Tony Stark. The picture also
includes Harley-Davidson Inc. (HOG)&#8217;s $15,500 FLS Softail Slim
motorcycle, the ride of choice for Captain America, played by
30-year-old Chris Evans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Generations of Fans &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyndham, based in Parsippany, New Jersey, made collectible
room key-cards and commissioned 400,000 copies of a comic book
from Disney&#8217;s Marvel division to distribute free at its
properties. The comic features &#8220;Avengers&#8221; characters including
Iron Man and the Black Widow enjoying loyalty program perks such
as free rooms and Internet access. The Hulk works out in a
fitness center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Please don&#8217;t blow up any of our hotels,&#8221; Korman asked
Marvel&#8217;s illustrators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Avengers&#8221; fans include men age 35 and older, with median
household incomes that exceed $75,000, making them target buyers
for Harleys, said Dino Bernacchi, director of North American
marketing communication for the Milwaukee-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Likely Bikers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;Avengers&#8221; characters, including Captain America and
Thor, have decades of history and have sold millions of comic
books, Bernacchi said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They have a built-in fan base hungry to see this concept
come to life,&#8221; Bernacchi said, adding &#8220;they are 22 percent
more likely to purchase a motorcycle.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of movie-related toys, gadgets and apparel can exceed
film receipts, Jay Rasulo, chief financial officer of Burbank,
California-based Disney said last year. The company, which
didn&#8217;t respond to requests for interviews, is scheduled to
report fiscal second-quarter earnings on May 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney rose 0.6 percent to $43.81 yesterday in New York.
The stock has gained 17 percent this year, placing seventh among
the 16 stocks in the SP 500 Media Index. (S5MEDA) Discovery
Communications Inc. (DISCA), up 35 percent, is first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hasbro Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marvel-related toys, such as Thor hammers and Hulk fists,
are expected to generate a record $400 million in revenue this
year for licensee Hasbro Inc. (HAS), according to Drew Crum, an
analyst at Stifel Nicolaus  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect Disney to push the Marvel franchise more
aggressively across international markets,&#8221; Crum wrote in an
April 27 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Avengers&#8221; is the first Marvel film Disney has
marketed since purchasing the business for $4.2 billion in 2009.
The movie has broken international box office records, grossing
more than $281 million overseas as of May 2, Disney said in a
release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levine, the cologne maker, said the response has been
&#8220;phenomenal&#8221; to his line of &#8220;Avengers&#8221; scents, which retail
for $29.99 a bottle and target customers 16 years and older. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s all about being a hero,&#8221; he said. &#8220;People want to be
part of something good.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Noah Buhayar and Hugh Son" date="May 05, 2012 11:25 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-05/buffett-calls-goldman-preferred-deal-peanuts-for-berkshire.html"><headline>Buffett Calls Goldman Preferred Deal &#8216;Peanuts&#8217; for Berkshire</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett said his deals to
inject $8 billion in Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and General
Electric Co. (GE) were &#8220;peanuts&#8221; compared with longer-term bets his
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) made with stock picks and acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Those deals have not been key to Berkshire,&#8221; Buffett
said of the 2008 investments in Goldman and GE. &#8220;They&#8217;re not
remotely as important as buying Coca-Cola stock.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett bought $5 billion of preferred shares in Goldman
Sachs and $3 billion in GE at the depths of the credit crisis,
earning a 10 percent annual coupon and getting warrants to
acquire stock in the firms. The companies have since redeemed
the preferred stock, while Berkshire continues to reap dividends
from more enduring investments, such as the purchase of 
railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The values in Berkshire that have been accumulated by
some special security transaction are really just peanuts
compared to buying businesses like Geico, or Iscar or BNSF,&#8221; he
said today at his annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. &#8220;It&#8217;s not
a key to Berkshire&#8217;s future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett accumulated a stake in beverage maker Coca-Cola (KO) Co.
for about $1.3 billion from 1988 through 1994 and the holding is
now valued at more than $15 billion. He has also acquired
businesses like car insurer Geico and Israel&#8217;s Iscar
Metalworking Cos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s Lipitor, the cholesterol
pill that generated about $10.7 billion in sales for the world&#8217;s
biggest drug maker in 2011, loses patent protection in the U.K.
this weekend, the Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generic drugs companies can begin to copy the New York-
based company&#8217;s recipe for the tablet from tomorrow, the Times
said, without saying where it got the information. Lipitor lost
marketing exclusivity in the U.S. in November and Pfizer
reported this month that first-quarter profit fell 19 percent
after revenue from the drug declined because of generic
competition. &lt;/p&gt;
