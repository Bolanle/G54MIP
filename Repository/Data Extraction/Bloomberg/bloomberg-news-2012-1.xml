&lt;p&gt;Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA), the state
oil company, said it was given 60 days to pay Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)
about $255 million in cash to settle an arbitration claim over
assets seized by Hugo Chavez in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cash payment will settle a $907 million ruling by the
New York-based International Chamber of Commerce, adding to $191
million of Exxon debt that the Venezuelan company will cancel
and $300 million from frozen funds in a New York account, PDVSA
said on its website today. The ICC deducted $160 million in
counterclaims from the ruling provided the payment is made in 60
days, PDVSA said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the world&#8217;s largest oil company by market value,
originally sought to freeze $12 billion of PDVSA assets as
compensation for the nationalization of the Cerro Negro heavy-
crude project in the Orinoco belt. The freeze was overturned by
a U.K. court in March 2009, leading Exxon to reduce its
arbitration claim to $7 billion in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The government of Venezuela has always indicated that it
is willing to compensate investors for decisions made in the
strategic interest of the country,&#8221; PDVSA said in a statement
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICC handed Exxon the ruling for a net $746.9 million
payment on Dec. 23, according to a copy of the document obtained
by Bloomberg News today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Expropriation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil was the first international oil company to
abandon Venezuela after Chavez expropriated oil assets. The
World Bank&#8217;s International Centre for Settlement of Investment
Disputes, or ICSID, is also due to rule on the claim in a suit
filed against the Venezuelan government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This ICC arbitration award represents recovery on a
limited, contractual liability of PDVSA that was provided for in
the Cerro Negro project agreement,&#8221; Exxon spokesman Patrick McGinn said today in an e-mailed response to questions. &#8220;The
larger ICSID arbitration against the government of Venezuela is
ongoing and is expected to be argued in February.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chavez forced foreign oil producers into joint ventures as
minority partners in 2007 and is in international arbitration
with Exxon and ConocoPhillips (COP), which rejected Venezuela&#8217;s
revised terms. The Cerro Negro venture refined tar-like crude
into synthetic oil from wells in the Orinoco belt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The amount awarded represents a huge success for PDVSA,
which has said all along that the amount claimed was grossly
exaggerated,&#8221; George Kahale, a lawyer who at New York-based
Curtis who represents PDVSA, said today in an e-mailed response
to questions. &#8220;Remember that this is the case that began with
the $12 billion freezing order in London.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PDVSA set aside about $1 billion to $1.5 billion in
anticipation of the judgment, Credit Suisse said in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon recognizes Venezuela&#8217;s legal right to expropriate
assets subject to compensation at fair market value, Exxon&#8217;s
McGinn said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
Chief Executive Officer Virginia &#8220;Ginni&#8221; Rometty named Bruno Di Leo sales chief and Bridget Van Kralingen senior vice president
of consulting, her first promotions after taking over Jan. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Di Leo&#8217;s title will be senior vice president of sales and
distribution, IBM said in a memo to employees today. He was
previously general manager of IBM&#8217;s growth markets unit, while
Van Kralingen was the general manager of IBM&#8217;s North America
sales and distribution unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rometty, the first woman at the helm in IBM&#8217;s 100-year
history, is starting to form her management team after taking
the reins from Sam Palmisano. By expanding in areas such as
emerging markets, cloud computing and analytics, she is
trying to meet a goal of adding $20 billion in new revenue (IBM)
between 2010 and 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van Kralingen is replacing Frank Kern, who is retiring
after 35 years at the Armonk, New York-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM also appointed James Bramante senior vice president of
the growth markets unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM rose 1.3 percent to $186.30 at the close in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest and
most profitable U.S. bank, expanded last year amid &#8220;hostility&#8221;
toward the industry and as economic growth stagnated, according
to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;2011 was another year of challenges, both for JPMorgan
Chase and for countries around the world,&#8221; Dimon wrote in a
year-end e-mail to staff. &#8220;There is a lot of frustration out
there and more than a little hostility toward our industry.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, 55, respects the right of people to &#8220;speak their
mind&#8221; and acknowledged their frustrations, he wrote in the Dec.
20 e-mail. Everyone has an interest in spurring the economy and
creating jobs, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan hired 16,000 people in the U.S. in 2011, Dimon
said in the letter, expanding its total workforce to more than
260,000 in a year when financial companies announced more than
200,000 job cuts and protests against Wall Street firms spread
worldwide. The New York-based lender is adding about 175
branches a year in the U.S., he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the face of challenges, JPMorgan Chase is doing its
part,&#8221; Dimon wrote. &#8220;We have not shrunk back.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. economy, measured by gross domestic product,
probably expanded 1.8 percent in 2011, according to economists&#8217;
estimates compiled by Bloomberg, instead of the 3.1 percent
predicted a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which took a $25 billion bailout from U.S.
taxpayers in 2008, was among the first to repay the money.
Analysts including Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s Richard Ramsden
and Ed Najarian at International Strategy  Investment Group
Inc. have said the lender is one of the strongest in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPM employs the most comprehensive and holistic approach
to risk management among the U.S. money center banks and major
brokers,&#8221; Najarian, who has a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on the firm, wrote
in a research note last month. It&#8217;s &#8220;a strong, well-capitalized
bank that is attractively valued, well-managed and will continue
to post solid earnings growth, even against a challenging
economic and interest-rate backdrop.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan climbed 5.6 percent to $35.12 at 2:51 p.m. in New
York. The shares fell 22 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s four-year hunt
for billions of dollars in nationalized Venezuelan oil profits
isn&#8217;t finished after an international panel slashed the U.S. oil
company&#8217;s claim by 89 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venezuela&#8217;s state-controlled oil producer, known by the
acronym PDVSA (PDVSA), was ordered to pay Exxon $746.9 million for the
2007 seizure of oil wells, crude-processing facilities and
related equipment, according to a copy of the International
Chamber of Commerce&#8217;s Dec. 23 ruling obtained by Bloomberg News.
The award represents 11 percent of the $7 billion sought by
Exxon, the world&#8217;s largest company (XOM) by market value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the first international energy explorer to abandon
Venezuela four-and-a-half years ago when Hugo Chavez
consolidated control of the nation&#8217;s oil industry, is counting
on a separate arbitration case overseen by the World Bank to win
billions in potential profits the company says were lost as a
result of the nationalization, said Lysle Brinker, director of
energy equity research at IHS Inc. (IHS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Initially, this looks like a pretty low number because it
does not fully reflect the value of the assets Exxon lost,&#8221;
Brinker said yesterday in a telephone interview from Norwalk,
Connecticut. &#8220;But this is not over yet.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon and the Venezuelan government are scheduled to resume
arguments before the World Bank panel in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cerro Negro &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon sought arbitration with PDVSA and the Venezuelan
government in 2007, a decade after Mobil Corp. began drilling
wells in the Orinoco River basin and building facilities to
process the region&#8217;s thick, tar-like crude. Exxon acquired (XOM) Mobil
and assumed operations of the Cerro Negro venture in 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PDVSA said yesterday on its website that it will pay $255
million in cash for the judgment, after accounting for about
$300 million in a frozen New York bank account and $191 million
in Exxon debt that the Venezuelan company will cancel. The total
amount of the International Chamber of Commerce ruling was for
$907.6 million, minus a $161 million counterclaim by PDVSA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ConocoPhillips (COP), which joined Exxon in rejecting Venezuela&#8217;s
new terms in 2007, also is awaiting a ruling in its case before
the World Bank panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the final year of operations under Exxon&#8217;s control
in 2006, the Venezuelan assets had net income of $362 million on
sales of $758 million, a profit margin that was quadruple the
company&#8217;s worldwide average. Exxon originally sought $12 billion
in compensation for the nationalization and later lowered its
demand to $7 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Fair-Market Value&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s $406 billion market value exceeds Venezuela&#8217;s total
economic output and is larger than the gross domestic products
of all but 23 of the world&#8217;s nations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chavez&#8217;s seizure of assets cost Exxon 425 million barrels
of proved reserves at the end of 2007, which had a market value
of $38 billion at the time of the nationalization, based on
Bloomberg calculations. Exxon stock rose 16 percent in 2011, the
largest annual increase since 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling by the New York-based International Chamber of
Commerce probably has few implications for foreign investment in
Venezuela&#8217;s energy sector, Brinker said. Although U.S. and
European producers such as Chevron Corp. (CVX), Total SA (FP) and Statoil
ASA (STL) yielded to the 2007 seizures that made them junior partners
to PDVSA, Chavez has been increasingly courting investments from
Russian and Chinese energy firms, Brinker said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ratings Unchanged &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard  Poor&#8217;s Ratings Services today said it won&#8217;t
change its B+ rating on PDVSA as a result of the ICC judgment.
Given that PDVSA held about $9 billion in cash as of June 30,
&#8220;the compensation amount will not effect the company&#8217;s
liquidity,&#8221; Fabiola Ortiz, an SP analyst based in Mexico City,
said today in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The separate proceeding before the World Bank&#8217;s
International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes
is &#8220;larger&#8221; than the ICC case, Patrick McGinn, an Exxon
spokesman, said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We recognize Venezuela&#8217;s legal right to expropriate
assets subject to compensation at fair-market value,&#8221; McGinn
said. &#8220;This ICC arbitration award represents recovery on a
limited, contractual liability of PDVSA that was provided for in
the Cerro Negro project agreement. Contract sanctity and respect
for the rule of law are core principles used to manage our
business over the long term.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World Bank Panel &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three-person World Bank panel was created in August
2008 and began deliberations in November 2008, according to case
documents published on the ICSID&#8217;s website. The panel was
occupied with jurisdictional arguments until June 2010 and
disputes about document production through March 2011, the
filings showed. Hearings are scheduled to resume next month,
McGinn said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel members are French jurist Gilbert Guillaume,
University of Geneva professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, and
Egyptian lawyer Ahmed Sadek El-Kosheri, according to the ICSID&#8217;s
website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guillaume, 81, adjudicated a century-old territorial
dispute between Indonesia and Malaysia when he was president of
the International Court of Justice from 2000 to 2003. He also
presided over Belgium&#8217;s unsuccessful attempt to prosecute an
African politician for war crimes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaufmann-Kohler, a former director of Zurich-based UBS AG,
was Exxon&#8217;s nominee to the panel. El-Kosheri, 79, was
Venezuela&#8217;s nominee. He&#8217;s a former legal adviser to the Kuwaiti
oil ministry and a partner in the Cairo law firm Kosheri, Rashed
 Riad. Guillaume was assigned to the case by the ICSID. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, was sued for about $95 million over
mortgage loans bundled into securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan &#8220;materially breached&#8221; representations about
loans backing the securities, a mortgage-securitization trust
said in a summons filed Dec. 30 in New York State Supreme Court
in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bear Stearns trust is seeking damages of at least
$95 million, according to the court filing. Bear Stearns Cos.,
which was acquired by JPMorgan, and EMC Mortgage Corp. are also
named as defendants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to
comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bear Stearns Asset Backed Securities Trust
2005-4 v. EMC Mortgage Corp., 650003-2012, New York State
Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Nathan Crooks" date="Jan 04, 2012  7:37 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-04/chavez-calls-exxon-s-venezuela-arbitration-demands-crazy-.html"><headline>Chavez Calls Exxon&#8217;s Venezuela Arbitration Demands &#8216;Crazy&#8217;</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said
today that Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s demand for as much as $12 billion
in international arbitration for assets seized in the South
American country in 2007 was &#8220;crazy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to the International Chamber of Commerce
arbitration court&#8217;s December decision to award Exxon a net
payment of $746.9 million, Chavez said on national television
that Venezuela is a sovereign nation and that Exxon has been
&#8220;arrogant&#8221; for not accepting a &#8220;friendly agreement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The ICC only awarded Exxon 10 percent of what they
wanted,&#8221; said Chavez. &#8220;You can make your own conclusions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil was the first international oil company to
abandon Venezuela after Chavez expropriated oil assets in the
Orinoco heavy crude belt. The World Bank&#8217;s International Centre
for Settlement of Investment Disputes, or ICSID, is also due to
rule on Exxon&#8217;s claim for its nationalized Cerro Negro project
in a suit filed against the Venezuelan government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA), the state oil company, said on
Jan. 2 that it would pay $255 million in cash for the judgment,
after accounting for about $300 million in a frozen New York
bank account and $191 million of Exxon debt that the Venezuelan
company will cancel. The total amount of the ICC ruling was for
$907.6 million, minus a $161 million counterclaim by PDVSA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freeze Sought &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The ICC decision was very limited and was only a decision
based on the contract between PDVSA and Exxon written in 1997.
The $907 million award was solely for Exxon&#8217;s missed and
expected, and heavily discounted, future revenue streams on
1997-priced oil of $27 a barrel from the project through 2035,
and not about a valuation,&#8221; said Russ Dallen, a lawyer and head
bond trader at Caracas Capital Markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the world&#8217;s largest oil company by market value,
originally sought to freeze $12 billion of PDVSA assets as
compensation for the nationalization of the Cerro Negro heavy-
crude project in the Orinoco belt. The freeze was overturned by
a U.K. court in March 2009, leading Exxon to reduce its
arbitration claim to around $7 billion in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given that the ICC award did not cover the actual
expropriation of Exxon&#8217;s investment -- merely the net present
value of its future discounted profit stream, minus Venezuelan
royalties and taxes -- I would expect the ICSID judgment to
easily come in for almost $1 billion minimum, rising to $3
billion if they use a more modest discount and higher real world
oil price than the $27 to $35 provided for in the 1997
contract,&#8221; Dallen said today in an e-mailed response to
questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proceedings before the ICSID, as the World Bank&#8217;s
arbitration court is called, is &#8220;larger&#8221; than the ICC case,
Patrick McGinn, an Exxon spokesman, said on Jan. 2 in an e-
mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Jef Feeley" date="Jan 04, 2012  5:01 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-04/pfizer-must-pay-45-million-in-prempro-cases-pennsylvania-court-rules.html"><headline>Pfizer Must Pay $45 Million in Prempro Cases, Court Rules</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) must pay more than
$45 million in damages to two women who blamed the company&#8217;s
menopause drugs for their breast cancers, an appeals court
ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connie Barton and Donna Kendall, two Illinois women who
sued Pfizer units Wyeth and Pharmacia  Upjohn over their
menopause medications, deserved both compensatory and punitive
damages over the companies&#8217; handling of the drugs, a panel of
the Pennsylvania Superior Court judge ruled yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are very disappointed with the court&#8217;s decisions in
these cases and continue to believe there was no basis in fact
or law for the jury verdicts,&#8221; Chris Loder, a spokesman for New
York-based Pfizer, said in an e-mailed statement. Pfizer
officials will ask the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to review the
lower court&#8217;s findings, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 6 million women took Prempro and related
menopause drugs to treat symptoms including hot flashes and mood
swings before a 2002 study highlighted their links to cancer. At
one point, Pfizer and its units faced more than 10,000 lawsuits
over the medications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a great way to start 2012 for these two brave
women,&#8221; Zoe Littlepage, one of Barton&#8217;s lawyers, said in a
telephone interview today. Under the appellate ruling, Barton
would get a total of $11.2 million while Kendall would get $34.3
million, Littlepage said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyeth&#8217;s sales of its Prempro and Premarin medicines, which
are still on the market, exceeded $2 billion before the release
of the Women&#8217;s Health Initiative study sponsored by the National
Institutes of Health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$840 Million Reserve &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Wyeth&#8217;s
Premarin, an estrogen-based drug, with progestin-laden Provera,
made by Pfizer&#8217;s Upjohn unit, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth
combined the two hormones in its Prempro pill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the height of the litigation, Pfizer faced more than
10,000 claims that its menopause drugs caused breast cancer,
according to lawyers for former users. Those lawsuits included
more than 8,000 cases consolidated in federal court in Arkansas
and suits in state courts in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Minnesota. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has begun settling some suits and has set aside
$840 million so far to resolve cases, officials said in
November. Pfizer has resolved about 46 percent of the pending
Prempro suits, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compensatory, Punitive Damages &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Barton&#8217;s case, a Philadelphia jury awarded the retired
records clerk $3.7 million in compensatory damages and $75
million in punitives in October 2009. A judge later reduced the
punitive award against Wyeth by more than 90 percent to $5.6
million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A month later, a separate Philadelphia jury awarded Kendall
$6.3 million in compensatory damages and $28 million in punitive
damages from both Wyeth and Pharmacia  Upjohn. A judge later
cut that punitive award to $1 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state appellate court combined the two verdicts for
review since both involved Illinois residents who brought their
suits in Pennsylvania. Wyeth has operations in the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court ruled jurors properly found that Wyeth and Upjohn
should be held liable for breast cancers tied to their menopause
drugs and both properly faced punitive damage awards over their
handling of the medication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kendall&#8217;s whole $28 million punitive award was upheld while
Barton&#8217;s final punitive award was increased by almost $2 million
to $7.4 million under the court&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There was sufficient evidence of gross negligence and
willful and wanton misconduct to support imposition of punitive
damages,&#8221; the panel said in its 46-page ruling in Barton&#8217;s
case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Extraordinary Victory&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court noted that while Kendall&#8217;s punitive award was
large, it &#8220;correlated with the enormity of the defendants&#8217;
wrongs, their clear liability and the devastating impact on the
plaintiff,&#8221; according to the 53-page decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is an extraordinary victory for Mrs. Kendall,&#8221; Tobi Millrood, one of her lawyers, said in an e-mailed statement.
&#8220;The appellate court didn&#8217;t mince words: Wyeth and Upjohn
engaged in a pattern of misconduct that was not the result of
mere accident or happenstance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Connie J. Barton v. Wyeth Pharmaceuticals
Inc., 694 EDA 2010, Superior Court of Pennsylvania; Donna
Kendall v. Wyeth Inc., 936 EDA 2010, Superior Court of
Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rometty, the first woman at the helm in IBM&#8217;s 100-year
history, is starting to form her management team after taking
the reins from Sam Palmisano. By expanding in areas such as
emerging markets, cloud computing and analytics, she&#8217;s trying to
meet a goal of adding $20 billion in new revenue between 2010
and 2015. Analysts on average estimate IBM will report $107.2
billion in sales for 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They make sure that people understand all aspects of the
company as part of the management mentoring process,&#8221; Laura D. Tyson, a business professor at the University of California,
Berkeley, said in a phone interview before the promotions were
announced. &#8220;They develop their own talent, and my sense is that
it&#8217;s done in a collegial or camaraderie fashion -- as opposed to
a very competitive, intense sort -- to keep the team together.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van Kralingen is replacing Frank Kern, who is retiring
after 35 years at the Armonk, New York-based company. IBM also
appointed James Bramante senior vice president of the growth
markets unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM fell 0.4 percent to $185.54 at the close in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van Kralingen, the new senior vice president of IBM Global
Business Services, the company&#8217;s consulting unit, is a South
African who has led turnarounds in global business services in
northeast Europe, IBM said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Di Leo, a native of Peru, joined IBM in 1975 as a software
engineer. His replacement, Bramante, will be based in Shanghai
with the elevated title of senior vice president as IBM seeks to
boost its growth markets unit to 30 percent of sales by 2015. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) reached a long-term
agreement with Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) that provides cable TV subscribers
with programs on TVs, computers and mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement comes a year before existing accords expire
and will run for a decade, according to a person with knowledge
of the situation who wasn&#8217;t authorized to speak publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney may receive $22 billion to $25 billion for ESPN
programming alone over the 10 years, said Derek Baine, an
analyst at SNL Kagan. The accord with Comcast, the largest U.S.
pay-TV company, averts fee disputes that can interrupt cable
service. For the first time, Comcast customers will be able to
watch ESPN, Disney and ABC shows live or on demand on multiple
screens, the companies said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The consumer ultimately gets more utility,&#8221; said David Bank, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in New York. &#8220;I think
it generally helps justify higher affiliate fees.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement will deliver 70 separate services from
Disney, ABC and ESPN to customers of Philadelphia-based Comcast
and includes new technologies that may arise over the period,
the companies said in the statement. Financial terms of the
arrangement weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyst Baine estimates ESPN program fees will rise 6
percent to 8 percent annually. Payments for Disney channels,
mobile applications and other services will add to the total, he
estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Inclusive &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accord includes Disney cable channels and ABC broadcast
stations owned by the Burbank, California-based company,
according to the statement. Comcast will introduce Disney
Junior, a new 24-hour basic cable channel for preschoolers, the
companies said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see this deal as a template for other deals we&#8217;re
negotiating, although there aren&#8217;t many that have the breadth
and scope that Disney brings,&#8221; Neil Smit, president of Comcast
Cable (TCOMA), said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement marks the first time Disney cable channels
will stream content to authenticated pay-TV customers using
mobile devices and computers. ESPN already had such agreements
with 40 million pay-TV homes, George Bodenheimer,
executive chairman of the sports network, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re working on more of them,&#8221; Bodenheimer said &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the theme-park and media company, rose 1.4 percent
to $38.85 at the close in New York. The shares were little
changed last year. Comcast, which had 20.3 million video
subscribers at the close of the third quarter, gained 1 percent
to $24.73 after rising 8 percent in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August 2010, Comcast signed a 10-year accord with CBS
Corp. (CBS) for access to the company&#8217;s Showtime premium cable network
and its TV stations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have similar deals in structure that we will be
pursuing,&#8221; Anne Sweeney, co-chairman of Disney Media Networks,
said in an interview. &#8220;We think that this is the future of how
viewers will be watching their TV and consuming content.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU) rose the
most since August after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. added the yoga-
wear retailer to its &#8220;Conviction List&#8221; of highly recommended
stocks, citing sales growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lululemon, based in Vancouver, advanced (LULU) 8.8 percent to
$51.15 at the close in New York for the biggest gain since Aug.
23. The shares increased 36 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The retailer&#8217;s shares could rise to $64 in the next six-
months, Michelle Tan, an analyst with Goldman Sachs, said in a
report today. Stabilizing inventory and annual sales growth of
more than 30 percent make the stock attractive, Tan wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lululemon &#8220;offers one of the most compelling stories in
retail, with continuing brand momentum,&#8221; New York-based Tan
said, adding that inventories improved in the fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Karen Gullo and Mark Chediak" date="Jan 04, 2012  3:02 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-04/chevron-loses-bid-to-throw-out-18-billion-award-in-ecuador-pollution-case.html"><headline>Chevron Bid to Dismiss $18 Billion Award Rejected in Ecuador</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) lost its challenge to
an $18 billion judgment before an Ecuador appeals court in a
lawsuit alleging the company is responsible for chemicals
spilled in the Amazon River basin more than 20 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision upholding the lower-court judgment was issued
by a panel of three judges in the Provincial Court of Justice of
Sucumbios in Lago Agrio, Ecuador, Chevron said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron appealed a February ruling that it was responsible
for chemical-laden wastewater dumped in jungle land from 1964 to
about 1992 by Texaco Inc., which Chevron acquired in 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court&#8217;s decision &#8220;gives us the ability to go
ahead and enforce the judgment in any part of the world we see
legally fit,&#8221; Pablo Fajardo, an attorney representing 30,000
Ecuadorean Amazon residents who sued, said in a conference call
from Quito. &#8220;We will investigate and look at various continents
around the world where Chevron has assets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the second-largest U.S. energy company, has no
assets or operations in Ecuador. The plaintiffs must wait until
the appeals court makes its decision final, which could take at
least a two weeks, before moving ahead with enforcement actions
in foreign courts, Fajardo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ecuador appeals court could require San Ramon,
California-based Chevron to post a bond equal to a percentage of
the $18 billion judgment, Fajardo said. Bond payment would block
the plaintiffs&#8217; ability to enforce the judgment elsewhere
pending the outcome of a further appeal by Chevron to the
country&#8217;s highest court, he said. The bond should be at least $3
billion, Fajardo said; the amount is up to the appeals court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Glaring Example&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;decision is another glaring example of the
politicization and corruption of Ecuador&#8217;s judiciary that has
plagued this fraudulent case from the start,&#8221; Chevron said in
yesterday&#8217;s statement. The company &#8220;does not believe that the
Ecuador ruling is enforceable in any court that observes the
rule of law.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court ratified the February ruling &#8220;in all of
its parts, including the conviction for moral reparation or its
alternative and costs,&#8221; according to the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron is still reviewing the ruling and hasn&#8217;t decided
what it will do next, Kent Robertson, a spokesman for the
company, said yesterday in a phone interview. He said the
company &#8220;has a procedural right to seek clarification and
amplification from the court that issued this ruling.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s Options &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron can also appeal the decision to the next level of
Ecuador&#8217;s judiciary, Robertson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karen Hinton, a spokeswoman for lawyers representing the
Ecuador residents who sued Chevron, said in an e-mailed
statement, &#8220;The decision by an independent appellate court is
yet further confirmation of Chevron&#8217;s extraordinary greed and
criminal misconduct in Ecuador.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron filed a claim in 2009 against Ecuador in the
Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague seeking orders that
it has no liability for the environmental pollution and that
PetroEcuador, the state-owned oil company that took over the
site, should pay the damage award. In those proceedings, Ecuador
was told in February to prevent enforcement of the judgment
until further order by the tribunal, Chevron said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Not Good&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September, the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York
overturned a lower-court decision blocking enforcement of the
award by the court in Ecuador. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is not good for Chevron, although it was expected,&#8221;
Fadel Gheit, an analyst at Oppenheimer  Co., said in a phone
interview today. &#8220;Chevron will exhaust all legal options, which
could drag for years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gheit said that he expected Chevron to eventually pay $2
billion to $3 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are going to have to watch this play out through the
international court system and the U.S. court system,&#8221; Brian Youngberg, an Edward Jones analyst in St. Louis, said in a phone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is going to be dragged out,&#8221; said Youngberg, who
rates Chevron shares a &#8220;buy&#8221; and doesn&#8217;t own any. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Very Content&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors still expect the ultimate outcome won&#8217;t &#8220;cost
the company,&#8221; Youngberg said. &#8220;There is really very little
that Ecuador can go after in the country and Chevron doesn&#8217;t
really have any material assets there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hinton said that the plaintiffs will seek to enforce the
judgment in countries where Chevron has assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecuador President Rafael Correa said he was &#8220;very
content&#8221; with the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I believe justice has been done,&#8221; Correa said on public
radio station Radio Publica. &#8220;More or less it&#8217;s like David
versus Goliath.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron fell 16 cents to $110.21 at 3 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) sued Kesa Electricals
Plc (KESA)&#8217;s Comet unit for allegedly selling more than 94,000
counterfeit disks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comet made fake versions of Windows Vista and Windows XP
recovery CDs at a factory in Hampshire, England, then sold them
at its retail outlets across the U.K., Microsoft said in a
statement on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Comet produced and sold thousands of counterfeit Windows
CDs to unsuspecting customers in the United Kingdom,&#8221; said
David Finn, associate general counsel in Microsoft&#8217;s anti-piracy
unit, in a statement on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has replaced Vista and Windows XP with Windows 7,
the operating system it introduced in October 2009. Together,
the Windows products run more than 90 percent of the world&#8217;s PCs
and account for 27 percent of Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft&#8217;s revenue (MSFT), according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comet said in an e-mailed statement it hadn&#8217;t infringed
Microsoft&#8217;s copyright and would defend the claim vigorously.
Kesa agreed in November to sell the money-losing Comet unit to
focus on markets such as France. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Business Software Alliance, a lobbying group whose
members include Microsoft, has estimated that piracy of computer
software cost the industry $59 billion in 2010, although the
U.S. Government Accountability Office has said the issue is too
complex to quantify. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) supplanted
Morgan Stanley (MS) as the leading adviser of mergers and
acquisitions last year in the $3.1 trillion chemical industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, based in New York, participated in 16
transactions last year with a combined value of $22.7 billion,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg, based on announced
deals and including financing and underwriting roles. Morgan
Stanley was fourth after Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Morgan Stanley was No. 1 in 2009 and 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transaction volume fell by 25 percent to $91.7 billion in
2011 from a year earlier as Europe&#8217;s debt crisis led chief
executive officers to avoid multi-billion-dollar deals in the
second half. JPMorgan&#8217;s tally includes advising potash producer
Mosaic Co. (MOS) when investor Cargill Inc. sold its stake. It worked
with DuPont Co. (DD) on its takeover of food-additives maker Danisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Once the wait-and-see mode has changed we might see some
positive surprises,&#8221; said Ken Oliver Fritz, head of investment
banking in Germany at Credit Suisse. &#8220;CEO confidence is the
most important factor and will have to improve if we want to see
more transactions in 2012.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consolidation is waiting to happen in several industries
and getting the right timing is important, Fritz said.
Opportunities abound for companies with cash on their balance
sheets as valuations are low compared to historical levels, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year&#8217;s biggest chemical deal was Warren Buffett&#8217;s
$9.22 billion acquisition of Lubrizol Corp. where advisers
included Citigroup Inc. (C) and Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR) DuPont paid
$7.1 billion for Danisco. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Datel Design and
Development Inc. settled patent-infringement and antitrust
litigation, according to Dec. 30 court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suits were related to the Xbox 360 video-game system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Datel, based in Staffordshire, England, sued Microsoft in
federal court in San Francisco in November 2009, claiming that
an upgrade issued by Microsoft was intended to disable Datel
products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft then sued Datel in federal court in Seattle in
December 2010. The Redmond, Washington-based company claimed
Datel infringed patent 7,787,411, which covers a protocol for
peripheral devices used with a wireless gaming console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Datel then redesigned its controllers and stopped importing
versions known as TurboFire2 Xbox 360 Wireless that were at the
heart of a complaint before the U.S. International Trade
Commission in Washington. In August, Microsoft withdrew its
infringement case, while still pursuing compensation for past
infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft spokesman Kevin Kutz confirmed the confidential
settlement of the litigation, saying the terms were &#8220;to the
satisfaction of both parties.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent case is Microsoft Corp. v. Datel Design and
Development Inc., 2:10-cv-02065-JLR, U.S. District Court,
Western District of Washington (Seattle). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The antitrust case is Datel Holdings Ltd. v. Microsoft
Corp., 3:09-cv-05535-EDL, U.S. District Court, Northern District
of California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tilaknagar Industries Defeats Label Trademark-Infringement Claim &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bombay&#8217;s High Court dismissed a trademark-infringement case
against Mumbai&#8217;s Tilaknagar Industries Ltd. (TLNGR) by a Dutch
distiller, India&#8217;s Economic Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was related to artwork depicting a London
building on a label used by Tilaknagar, according to the
Economic Times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UTO Nederland BV and Distilleerderji en Likeurstokerji
Herman Jansen BV had sued the Indian distiller saying its label
infringed their &#8220;Mansion House,&#8221; &#8220;MH,&#8221; &#8220;MHB&#8221; and &#8220;Savoy
Club&#8221; labels, Economic Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court said that there was no similarity between the
labels, and the depiction of the building didn&#8217;t constitute
infringement, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomingdale&#8217;s, Varvatos Accused of Infringing Musician Photos &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macy&#8217;s Inc. (M)&#8217;s Bloomingdale&#8217;s unit and clothing designer
John Varvatos were sued for copyright infringement by the estate
of photographer James Marshall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit is related to a series of photos of rock music
performers the estate claims are used in Bloomingdale&#8217;s and
Varvatos&#8217;s stores without authorization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint filed Dec. 29 in federal court
in Oakland, California, photo subjects include the Beatles, Ray
Charles, Jimi Hendrix, the Rolling Stones, John Coltrane, Jim
Morrison, Grace Slick, Janis Joplin and Miles Davis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Varvatos bought proof copies of these photos and is accused
of making unauthorized copies to display in his store in New
York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Marshall learned of this while he was still alive, he
put Varvatos on notice that it wasn&#8217;t acceptable and &#8220;did
Varvatos a favor and allowed him to keep the reproductions on
the wall in the one store and the one store only,&#8221; according to
court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Marshall&#8217;s death, Varvatos is accused of making &#8220;new
infringing reproductions&#8221; to display in additional stores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estate says it&#8217;s harmed by these actions and asked the
court for an order barring future use of the images by the
defendants, and awards of money damages, attorney fees and
litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomingdale&#8217;s spokeswoman Marissa Vitagliano said in an e-
mail that her company doesn&#8217;t comment on litigation. Varvatos
didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estate is represented by Lawrence G. Townsend of the
Law Offices of Lawrence G. Townsend in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Estate of James J. Marshall v. John Varvatos of
California Inc., 3:11-cv-06702-DMR, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of California (Oakland). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Loses Bid to Keep Software Information Under Seal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s bid to keep under seal information it called
&#8220;trade secrets,&#8221; even though it&#8217;s already available on the
Internet and in print, was denied by a federal judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because much of the information about Apple&#8217;s Mac OS X
operating systems is publicly available by examining the
software itself or through websites and a book on the
technology, it can&#8217;t be given trade-secret protection, U.S.
District Judge William Alsup said in a ruling yesterday in San
Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling came in Apple&#8217;s successful copyright-
infringement lawsuit against Psystar Corp., a maker of Macintosh
computer clones that was barred in 2009 by Alsup from selling
copies of Apple&#8217;s operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristin Huguet, a spokeswoman for Cupertino, California-
based Apple, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a voice-mail message

Psystar, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking

&lt;p&gt;Court Lets 17 Insurers Off Hook to Cover Infringement Verdict &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Pennsylvania state court judge said a group of 17
insurers has no obligation to indemnify two defendants who were
ordered to pay a $30 million judgment in a copyright-
infringement lawsuit, Pittsburgh&#8217;s Post-Gazette reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $30 million is to be paid to the William A. Graham Co.
insurance brokerage, which sued USI MidAtlantic Inc. and Thomas
P. Haughey for unauthorized use of the company&#8217;s documents,
according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Montgomery County Common Pleas Court Judge Stanley Ott said
the infringement defendants&#8217; actions didn&#8217;t fall within their
insurance policy&#8217;s &#8220;advertising injury&#8221; coverage, according to
the Post-Gazette. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defendants had argued their actions fell within their
policy&#8217;s coverage of &#8220;an offense committed in the course of
advertising your goods, products or services,&#8221; the Post-Gazette
reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Datel Design and
Development Inc. settled patent-infringement and antitrust
litigation, according to Dec. 30 court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suits were related to the Xbox 360 video-game system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Datel, based in Staffordshire, England, sued Microsoft in
federal court in San Francisco in November 2009, claiming that
an upgrade issued by Microsoft was intended to disable Datel
products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft then sued Datel in federal court in Seattle in
December 2010. The Redmond, Washington-based company claimed
Datel infringed patent 7,787,411, which covers a protocol for
peripheral devices used with a wireless gaming console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Datel then redesigned its controllers and stopped importing
versions known as TurboFire2 Xbox 360 Wireless that were at the
heart of a complaint before the U.S. International Trade
Commission in Washington. In August, Microsoft withdrew its
infringement case, while still pursuing compensation for past
infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft spokesman Kevin Kutz confirmed the confidential
settlement of the litigation, saying the terms were &#8220;to the
satisfaction of both parties.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent case is Microsoft Corp. v. Datel Design and
Development Inc., 2:10-cv-02065-JLR, U.S. District Court,
Western District of Washington (Seattle). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The antitrust case is Datel Holdings Ltd. v. Microsoft
Corp., 3:09-cv-05535-EDL, U.S. District Court, Northern District
of California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tilaknagar Industries Defeats Label Trademark-Infringement Claim &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bombay&#8217;s High Court dismissed a trademark-infringement case
against Mumbai&#8217;s Tilaknagar Industries Ltd. (TLNGR) by a Dutch
distiller, India&#8217;s Economic Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was related to artwork depicting a London
building on a label used by Tilaknagar, according to the
Economic Times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UTO Nederland BV and Distilleerderji en Likeurstokerji
Herman Jansen BV had sued the Indian distiller saying its label
infringed their &#8220;Mansion House,&#8221; &#8220;MH,&#8221; &#8220;MHB&#8221; and &#8220;Savoy
Club&#8221; labels, Economic Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court said that there was no similarity between the
labels, and the depiction of the building didn&#8217;t constitute
infringement, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomingdale&#8217;s, Varvatos Accused of Infringing Musician Photos &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macy&#8217;s Inc. (M)&#8217;s Bloomingdale&#8217;s unit and clothing designer
John Varvatos were sued for copyright infringement by the estate
of photographer James Marshall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit is related to a series of photos of rock music
performers the estate claims are used in Bloomingdale&#8217;s and
Varvatos&#8217;s stores without authorization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint filed Dec. 29 in federal court
in Oakland, California, photo subjects include the Beatles, Ray
Charles, Jimi Hendrix, the Rolling Stones, John Coltrane, Jim
Morrison, Grace Slick, Janis Joplin and Miles Davis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Varvatos bought proof copies of these photos and is accused
of making unauthorized copies to display in his store in New
York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Marshall learned of this while he was still alive, he
put Varvatos on notice that it wasn&#8217;t acceptable and &#8220;did
Varvatos a favor and allowed him to keep the reproductions on
the wall in the one store and the one store only,&#8221; according to
court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Marshall&#8217;s death, Varvatos is accused of making &#8220;new
infringing reproductions&#8221; to display in additional stores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estate says it&#8217;s harmed by these actions and asked the
court for an order barring future use of the images by the
defendants, and awards of money damages, attorney fees and
litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomingdale&#8217;s spokeswoman Marissa Vitagliano said in an e-
mail that her company doesn&#8217;t comment on litigation. Varvatos
didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estate is represented by Lawrence G. Townsend of the
Law Offices of Lawrence G. Townsend in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Estate of James J. Marshall v. John Varvatos of
California Inc., 3:11-cv-06702-DMR, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of California (Oakland). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Loses Bid to Keep Software Information Under Seal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s bid to keep under seal information it called
&#8220;trade secrets,&#8221; even though it&#8217;s already available on the
Internet and in print, was denied by a federal judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because much of the information about Apple&#8217;s Mac OS X
operating systems is publicly available by examining the
software itself or through websites and a book on the
technology, it can&#8217;t be given trade-secret protection, U.S.
District Judge William Alsup said in a ruling yesterday in San
Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling came in Apple&#8217;s successful copyright-
infringement lawsuit against Psystar Corp., a maker of Macintosh
computer clones that was barred in 2009 by Alsup from selling
copies of Apple&#8217;s operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristin Huguet, a spokeswoman for Cupertino, California-
based Apple, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a voice-mail message
seeking comment on the ruling. Kiwi Camara, an attorney for
Psystar, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Apple v. Psystar Corp., 08-cv-3251, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Court Lets 17 Insurers Off Hook to Cover Infringement Verdict &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Pennsylvania state court judge said a group of 17
insurers has no obligation to indemnify two defendants who were
ordered to pay a $30 million judgment in a copyright-
infringement lawsuit, Pittsburgh&#8217;s Post-Gazette reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $30 million is to be paid to the William A. Graham Co.
insurance brokerage, which sued USI MidAtlantic Inc. and Thomas
P. Haughey for unauthorized use of the company&#8217;s documents,
according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Montgomery County Common Pleas Court Judge Stanley Ott said
the infringement defendants&#8217; actions didn&#8217;t fall within their
insurance policy&#8217;s &#8220;advertising injury&#8221; coverage, according to
the Post-Gazette. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defendants had argued their actions fell within their
policy&#8217;s coverage of &#8220;an offense committed in the course of
advertising your goods, products or services,&#8221; the Post-Gazette
reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. (BAC) lost a ruling
in a court fight against MBIA Inc. (MBI) that will help the bond
insurer as it tries to recover losses on home loans made by the
bank&#8217;s Countrywide Financial unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MBIA, which says it was duped into guaranteeing payment on
Countrywide mortgage bonds, needs only to show the lender made
misrepresentations about the loans backing the bonds, instead of
establishing they caused the losses the insurer is seeking to
recover, New York state Judge Eileen Bransten said in a decision
issued yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No basis in law exists to mandate that MBIA establish a
direct causal link between the misrepresentations allegedly made
by Countrywide and claims made under the policy,&#8221; she wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling is among legal disputes with bond insurers and
investors that &#8220;could significantly impact&#8221; the potential
costs from loans made before the collapse of the U.S. housing
market in 2008, Bank of America said in a regulatory filing in
August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defeats on such matters may add as much as $9 billion to
what Bank of America owes bond insurers, according to an August
estimate by hedge fund Branch Hill Capital, which has bet
against the lender&#8217;s stock and has invested in MBIA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MBIA, which sued Countrywide in 2008, guarantees payments
to investors that bought securities backed by pools of the
lender&#8217;s loans. The insurer says the loans were riskier than
Countrywide promised, and as they defaulted, the Armonk, New
York-based company was forced to make payments. Through
September 2010, MBIA had paid out $2.5 billion on mortgage
securities sponsored by Countrywide, Chief Executive Officer Jay
Brown told a New York State Assembly committee in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown said in an e-mailed statement that the company is
&#8220;very pleased&#8221; with the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The ruling provides us with a straightforward path to
recovery of our losses,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America is still
reviewing the ruling, spokesman Lawrence Grayson said in a phone
interview. He pointed out that the judge denied a ruling
requested by MBIA in connection with Countrywide&#8217;s obligations
to repurchase loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is MBIA Insurance Corp. v. Countrywide Home Loans
Inc., 602825-2008, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wegelin Bankers Said to Be Charged by U.S. in Tax Crackdown &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three Swiss bankers charged with conspiring to help U.S.
clients hide more than $1.2 billion from American tax
authorities worked at Switzerland&#8217;s Wegelin  Co., a person
familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Berlinka, Urs Frei and Roger Keller told clients
that they were less vulnerable to a U.S. crackdown on offshore
tax evasion because their bank didn&#8217;t have offices outside
Switzerland, according to an indictment filed yesterday in
federal court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank was Wegelin, according to the person, who wasn&#8217;t
authorized to speak about the matter and didn&#8217;t want to be
identified. The indictment refers to &#8220;Swiss Bank A&#8221; and said
all three worked at its Zurich branch. No one answered calls
after regular business hours at Wegelin, Switzerland&#8217;s oldest
private bank. Wegelin Bank&#8217;s Thomas Tschudi didn&#8217;t respond to an
e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indictment comes amid U.S.-Swiss talks to resolve a
U.S. probe of offshore tax evasion. Officials are trying to
conclude negotiations on a civil settlement with Swiss banks, as
well as criminal probes of 11 of them, including Wegelin, based
in St. Gallen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors have filed tax charges against more than three
dozen former U.S. clients of UBS AG (UBSN) and Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN),
Switzerland&#8217;s two biggest banks, and London-based HSBC Holdings
Plc (HSBA), Europe&#8217;s biggest bank. At least 24 bankers, advisers and
attorneys also have been charged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indictment details how Berlinka, Frei and Keller helped
23 U.S. clients open undeclared accounts at their bank. Kenneth
Heller, a disbarred New York maritime attorney who pleaded
guilty on June 27 to hiding more than $26.4 million in accounts
at UBS and Wegelin, is also referred to in the indictment. He is
scheduled to be sentenced Jan. 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Berlinka, 12-cr-00002, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Sued for $95 Million Over Mortgage Securities &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S. bank by assets, was
sued for about $95 million over mortgage loans bundled into
securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan &#8220;materially breached&#8221; representations about
loans backing the securities, a mortgage-securitization trust
said in a summons filed Dec. 30 in New York State Supreme Court
in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bear Stearns trust is seeking damages of at least $95
million, according to the court filing. Bear Stearns Cos., which
was acquired by New York-based JPMorgan, and EMC Mortgage Corp.
are also named as defendants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to
comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bear Stearns Asset Backed Securities Trust
2005-4 v. EMC Mortgage Corp., 650003-2012, New York State
Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WJB Capital Group Sued by Investor Alleging Fraud &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WJB Capital Group Inc., the Wall Street firm that said it&#8217;s
shutting down its brokerage operations, was sued by an investor
over fraud allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WJB Capital and Chief Executive Officer Craig Rothfeld were
accused of fraud, breach of contract and other claims over a
$250,000 investment in the company, according to a lawsuit filed
Dec. 31 in New York State Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James McNally said that in exchange for a $250,000
investment he was promised &#8220;compensation for the duration of
the investment.&#8221; WJB Capital failed to pay and used the money
&#8220;for fraudulent purposes,&#8221; according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We deny the allegations,&#8221; Rothfeld said about McNally&#8217;s
complaint. &#8220;They are baseless and without merit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An attorney for McNally didn&#8217;t reply to a message seeking
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WJB Capital voluntarily ceased broker-dealer operations
yesterday, Rothfeld said. The company was &#8220;unable to raise
capital in a manner that would have allowed the firm to continue
its operations given the current climate and the constraints
that would have been placed on everyone,&#8221; the CEO said &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is James McNally v. WJB Capital Group Inc.,

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan May Know Soon If Lehman Lawsuit Will Be Dismissed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., fighting Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. (LEHMQ) over billions of dollars in claims and damages, may know
soon whether its bid to dismiss the defunct firm&#8217;s $8.6 billion
lawsuit will succeed, a district judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan in New York said he is
&#8220;working on&#8221; a decision on whether Lehman&#8217;s suit against the
biggest U.S. bank belongs in district court, according to court
papers. However, a bankruptcy judge may be ready to rule soon on
JPMorgan&#8217;s move to dismiss the case, and should do so first,
Sullivan told both sides, according to a transcript of a Dec. 30
court session. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be in a situation where the bankruptcy
court is just doing nothing because they&#8217;re waiting for me to
rule,&#8221; Sullivan said. &#8220;They got this thing all teed up, maybe
just ready to press a button on it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman&#8217;s suit alleges the New York-based lender helped
cause its 2008 collapse by demanding $8.6 billion in collateral.
JPMorgan has argued that the case needs a district judge because
it raises legal issues beyond the jurisdiction of a bankruptcy
judge, who can&#8217;t rule on matters including Lehman&#8217;s allegation
that JPMorgan caused monetary damage to failing Lehman in 2008.
Lehman says the suit confines itself to bankruptcy matters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, JPMorgan is defending $6 billion in claims that
Lehman says are &#8220;significantly overstated.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history in
September 2008, listing $613 billion in debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which lent $70 billion to Lehman&#8217;s brokerage
around the time of the bankruptcy, sued Lehman back after the
$8.6 billion suit, alleging Lehman defrauded its lender into
making the loan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
08-13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). The lawsuit is Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 10-03266, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The district case is
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. v. JPMorgan Chase  Bank, 11-
cv-6760, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Seeks Recovery of All Gulf Spill Costs From Halliburton &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc (BP/) seeks to have Halliburton Co. (HAL), its cement contractor
for the Macondo well project whose blowout set off the 2010 Gulf
of Mexico oil spill, pay all of the oil company&#8217;s related costs
and damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP had paid more than $21 billion in cleanup costs and
economic damages to individuals, businesses and governments
harmed by the spill as of Dec. 1, the company said on its
website. BP reserved more than $40 billion to cover costs
related to the sinking of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig (RIG). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil company seeks &#8220;the amount of costs and expenses
incurred by BP to clean up and remediate the oil spill, the lost
profits from and/or diminution in value of the Macondo prospect,
and all other costs and damages incurred by BP related to the
Deepwater Horizon incident and resulting oil spill,&#8221; Don
Haycraft, BP&#8217;s lead trial attorney, said in a filing Jan. 2 in
federal court in New Orleans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP and Halliburton accuse each other&#8217;s employees of making
critical mistakes that caused the blowout of the London-based
oil company&#8217;s well off the Louisiana coast in 2010. The
explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon killed 11 workers and
caused the worst offshore spill in U.S. history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP, which owned the Macondo lease, and Halliburton, which
provided well-completion services for the project, jointly face
more than 500 lawsuits by coastal property owners, businesses
and governments claiming billions of dollars in damages from the
drifting oil. The lawsuits have been combined for pretrial
processing in federal court in New Orleans, where a judge is
scheduled to begin a trial in February to determine liability
for the spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halliburton, based in Houston, has said in court papers
that its cementing-services contract requires BP to indemnify it
from all damage claims, even if its employees were found to have
shared blame for the disaster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP, rejecting that argument, accused Halliburton in the
Jan. 2 filing of gross negligence. That level of misconduct
&#8220;will suffice to eliminate any indemnity obligation for damages
of any kind,&#8221; Haycraft said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re Oil Spill by the Oil Rig Deepwater
Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010, MDL-2179, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coal Producers Rise on Court&#8217;s Delay of EPA Pollution Rule &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. coal producers including Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU) and
Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR) rose after a federal court ruled
that the Environmental Protection Agency must delay implementing
air-pollution regulations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peabody, the largest U.S. coal-mining company, rose as much
as 10 percent. James River Coal Co. (JRCC), which operates mines in
Kentucky, gained as much as 13 percent while Patriot Coal Corp. (PCX)
advanced as much as 9.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Appeals Court in Washington on Dec. 30 granted a
request by electric power producers and other challengers to
delay the deadline for some plants to start reducing some
polluting emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EPA&#8217;s Cross-State Air Pollution Rule seeks to impose
caps on sulfur dioxide, which can lead to acid rain, and
nitrogen dioxide, a component of smog, in Texas and 26 eastern
states. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford Seeks Trial Delay After Court Puts Expert Pay on Hold &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R. Allen Stanford, accused of running a $7 billion
investment fraud, seeks a three-month delay in his Jan. 23 trial
date after his expert witnesses quit because they weren&#8217;t being
paid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford&#8217;s experts haven&#8217;t been paid for four months, Ali
Fazel, Stanford&#8217;s lead criminal-defense lawyer, said in court
papers filed Dec. 30 in federal court in Houston. They quit last
week after the U.S. Court of Appeals, which controls budgets for
Stanford&#8217;s publicly funded defense, ruled that it will &#8220;modify
and limit the expert budget moving forward&#8221; and withhold
payments to them until after the trial, Fazel said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford, 61, has been in custody since he was indicted in
June 2009 on charges of defrauding investors through bogus
certificates of deposit at his Antigua-based Stanford
International Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford was declared mentally fit for trial on Dec. 22,
after completing eight months of rehabilitation at a federal
prison hospital in Butner, North Carolina. U.S. District Judge
David Hittner found the former financier had sufficiently
recovered from head injuries suffered in a September 2009
jailhouse assault and an addiction to anxiety drugs prescribed
by prison doctors following the attack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fazel said in the Dec. 30 filings that prosecutors didn&#8217;t
oppose a one-week delay in yesterday&#8217;s deadline for filing
expert reports in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant U.S. Attorney Gregg Costa told Hittner last month
that the government doesn&#8217;t oppose a delay of six to eight weeks
in Stanford&#8217;s trial to give him more time to review documents
with his attorneys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laura Sweeney, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined
to comment on the request for a three-month delay, citing a gag
order issued by the judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Stanford, 09-cr-00342, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s Pursuit of Venezuelan Cash &#8216;Not Over Yet&#8217; After Ruling &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s four-year hunt for billions of dollars
in nationalized Venezuelan oil profits isn&#8217;t finished after an
international panel slashed the U.S. oil company&#8217;s claim by 89
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venezuela&#8217;s state-controlled oil producer, known by the
acronym PDVSA (PDVSA), was ordered to pay Exxon $746.9 million for the
2007 seizure of oil wells, crude-processing facilities and
related equipment, according to a copy of the International
Chamber of Commerce&#8217;s Dec. 23 ruling obtained by Bloomberg News.
The award represents 11 percent of the $7 billion sought by
Exxon, the world&#8217;s largest company (XOM) by market value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the first international energy explorer to abandon
Venezuela 4 1/2 years ago when Hugo Chavez consolidated control
of the nation&#8217;s oil industry, is counting on a separate
arbitration case overseen by the World Bank to win billions in
potential profits the company says were lost as a result of the
nationalization, said Lysle Brinker, director of energy equity
research at IHS Inc. (IHS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Initially, this looks like a pretty low number because it
does not fully reflect the value of the assets Exxon lost,&#8221;
Brinker said Jan. 2 in a telephone interview from Norwalk,
Connecticut. &#8220;But this is not over yet.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon and the Venezuelan government are scheduled to resume
arguments before the World Bank panel in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon sought arbitration with PDVSA and the Venezuelan
government in 2007, a decade after Mobil Corp. began drilling
wells in the Orinoco River basin and building facilities to
process the region&#8217;s thick, tar-like crude. Exxon acquired (XOM) Mobil
and assumed operations of the Cerro Negro venture in 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PDVSA said yesterday on its website that it will pay $255
million in cash for the judgment, after accounting for about
$300 million in a frozen New York bank account and $191 million
in Exxon debt that the Venezuelan company will cancel. The total
amount of the International Chamber of Commerce ruling was for
$907.6 million, minus a $161 million counterclaim by PDVSA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The separate proceeding before the World Bank&#8217;s
International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes
is &#8220;larger&#8221; than the ICC case, Patrick McGinn, an Exxon
spokesman, said Jan. 2 in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.K. Plans Appeal to Court Ruling Against Solar Subsidy Cut &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. government will appeal a High Court ruling against
its decision to cut subsidies for solar power, a spokeswoman for
the Department of Energy and Climate Change said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the government will submit the appeal today,
the spokeswoman said by phone yesterday, asking not to be named
in line with the department&#8217;s policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The High Court in London ruled on Dec. 21 that a government
decision to cut a feed-in tariff for solar energy starting on
Dec. 12 was &#8220;unlawful.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court decision was a victory for companies including
Solarcentury Holdings Ltd., which challenged the plan to reduce
rates paid for solar by as much as 55 percent before a
consultation with the industry finished on Dec. 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barker said on Twitter yesterday he planned to publish
proposals to reform the feed-in tariff scheme this month to make
it &#8220;more like Germany.&#8221; The spokeswoman said the government
aimed to publish the proposals, a second consultation that would
consider tariffs for non-solar photovoltaic technologies, &#8220;as
soon as possible.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers in both the ruling Conservative Party and the
Labour opposition say cuts are necessary to prevent a surge in
solar power from jacking up electricity bills. Climate Change
Minister Greg Barker wrote on his Twitter feed yesterday that he
would appeal the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The current high tariffs for solar PV are not
sustainable, and changes need to be made in order to protect the
budget, which is funded by consumers through their energy
bills,&#8221; Barker said in a statement in December. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Union Carbide Asbestos Verdict Erased by Mississippi Judge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A $322 million jury verdict in an asbestos case against Dow
Chemical Co. (DOW)&#8217;s Union Carbide unit and Chevron Phillips Chemical
Co. was overturned by a Mississippi judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies asked the state Supreme Court to overturn the
verdict, saying Smith County Circuit Judge Eddie Bowen had a
conflict of interest because his parents had asbestos legal
claims, including one against Union Carbide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state&#8217;s high court removed Bowen from the case last
year. His replacement, Special Judge William F. Coleman, said on
Dec. 22 that the companies&#8217; request to remove Bowen and vacate
the verdict were &#8220;well taken and should be granted.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The May 4, 2011, verdict was the largest ever made to a
single asbestos case plaintiff, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. State punitive-damages restrictions would have
reduced the verdict by at least $260 million. Coleman&#8217;s order
doesn&#8217;t include information on a new trial. The jury award was
the ninth-largest in the U.S. overall in 2011, according to
Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dow Chemical spokesman Scot Wheeler wasn&#8217;t available to
comment on the judge&#8217;s order. Bowen&#8217;s court administrator, Judy
Herrington, said he was out of the office and wouldn&#8217;t comment
on the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plaintiff Thomas Brown claimed he developed asbestosis
after being exposed to the toxic fibers while mixing drilling
mud on oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. He claimed Union Carbide
and Chevron Phillips knew asbestos is toxic and didn&#8217;t warn him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Brown v. Phillips Co., 2006-196, Circuit Court,
Smith County, Mississippi (Raleigh). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s
largest company by market value, is in talks with its Japanese
unit TonenGeneral Sekiyu K.K. (5012) to restructure its holdings in
Japan and plans to remain in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No decisions have been made,&#8221; Kosuke Kai, a spokesman
for ExxonMobil Yugen Kaisha, which holds a 50.02 percent stake
in TonenGeneral, said by telephone today. &#8220;ExxonMobil has no
plans to exit the Japan market and our customers will continue
to enjoy ExxonMobil&#8217;s brands and products.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TonenGeneral slumped to the lowest in more than 13 months
in Tokyo trading after Reuters reported that Exxon plans to sell
the bulk of its stake in the refiner. The Irving, Texas-based
company may divest most of its holding and assets including its
distribution network in Japan for about 400 billion yen ($5.2
billion), Reuters said today, citing people it didn&#8217;t identify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If Exxon&#8217;s stake declines, the Japanese refiner will need
to draw up its own growth strategy&#8221; as domestic rivals struggle
to expand their business outside Japan, Reiji Ogino, a Tokyo-
based analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co.,
said by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese refiners including JX Holdings Inc. (5020) have been
investing upstream energy projects, overseas projects or
renewable energy as the nation&#8217;s long-term demand is forecast to
decline because of a shrinking population. Japan&#8217;s oil-product
demand may decline at a rate of 3.5 percent a year through March
2015, according to an estimate by the country&#8217;s trade ministry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Spur Consolidation&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stake reduction by Exxon &#8220;could spur consolidation in
the Japanese refining industry,&#8221; said Hidetoshi Shioda, a
Tokyo-based analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. &#8220;This would
reduce the number of domestic players and reduce excessive
competition, and all Japanese refiners would profit from it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TonenGeneral plans to fund the purchase of Exxon&#8217;s stake by
borrowing from banks, and the deal may be announced early this
month and completed in spring, Reuters said. Exxon will retain a
share in the company and supply crude oil to the refiner,
according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The report is not based on statements by ExxonMobil,&#8221;
spokesman Kai said. &#8220;We have made no announcements and, as a
matter of practice, we do not comment on market rumors or
speculation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan Assets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Exxon, the move would be part of plans to focus on
exploration and production of oil and natural gas and move away
from refining. Its unit, ExxonMobil Yugen Kaisha, also owns a 50
percent stake in Kyokuto Petroleum Industries Ltd., a joint
venture with Mitsui Oil Co., which operates a 175,000 barrel-a-
day refinery in Chiba, near Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TonenGeneral fell 5.8 percent to close at 792 yen, the
lowest since Nov. 17, 2010. The stock has slumped 12 percent in
the past year, compared with the 18 percent drop in the
benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s stake in the refiner is valued at about 238 billion
yen based on current share prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have been doing business in Japan for over 118 years.
In that time we have continuously innovated and adapted our
business to meet the needs of society and the changing business
environment,&#8221; Kai said. &#8220;In addition, we continue to look for
opportunities to strengthen our competitive position in Japan
and increase shareholder value.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rajat Gupta, the former Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) director charged with insider trading as part of the
Galleon Group LLC probe, asked a judge to dismiss some of the
counts against him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government&#8217;s indictment focuses on two instances in
which the U.S. said Galleon co-founder Raj Rajaratnam traded on
information he allegedly received from Gupta, though it
&#8220;improperly uses those two instances to create five purportedly
separate substantive securities-fraud charges,&#8221; according to
Gupta&#8217;s filing in federal court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The five substantive securities fraud counts in the
indictment, because they stem from just two purported unlawful
acts, repeatedly charge what are, at most, two alleged
offenses,&#8221; according to the filing yesterday. Gupta asked the
judge to consolidate the charges or order prosecutors to choose
which to pursue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate filing yesterday, Gupta asked that
prosecutors be barred from using wiretap evidence. The
government intends to present a &#8220;circumstantial case&#8221;
based on the timing of alleged telephone calls between Gupta
and Rajaratnam and recordings the U.S. obtained by wiretapping
Rajaratnam&#8217;s cell phone, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta&#8217;s lawyers said the court&#8217;s rejection of a similar bid
by Rajaratnam to bar the intercepts as evidence during his trial
was incorrect. Federal laws restricting use of wiretaps don&#8217;t
permit them in investigations of suspected insider trading,
according to Gupta&#8217;s filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PG (PG), McKinsey &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta, who also sat on the board of Procter  Gamble Co.
and led McKinsey  Co., was indicted by a federal grand jury in
October on five counts of securities fraud and one count of
conspiracy to commit securities fraud for passing inside
information to Rajaratnam. Gupta also faces a lawsuit filed by
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara
in Manhattan, didn&#8217;t immediately return a call seeking comment
on the filings after regular business hours yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, 54, was convicted in May of directing the
biggest insider-trading ring in a generation. His 11-year prison
term was the longest sentence ever handed down for such a crime
and the culmination of a four-year nationwide probe of insider
trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He reported to a federal medical prison in Ayer,
Massachusetts, on Dec. 5 to begin serving his term A three-judge
panel rejected Rajaratnam&#8217;s request to remain free while he
appeals his conviction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Gupta, 11-cr-00907, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Union Drilling Inc. (UDRL), the rig owner
hired by Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) to explore U.S. shale rock formations
for natural gas, toughened drug testing of rig workers in an
attempt to cut down on accidents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Union is switching to hair-follicle tests from urinalysis
to detect drug use, Chief Executive Officer Christopher Strong
said at the Pritchard Capital energy conference in San Francisco
yesterday. The new protocol already has reduced emergency calls
from its drilling sites, he said, according to a transcript of
his presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy producers exploring shale rock are facing increased
scrutiny from environmental regulators, landowners, lawmakers
and investors after intensive drilling techniques were linked to
water contamination and earthquakes. Drug abuse tends to be more
frequent among drilling crews than other oilfield workers, Roger
New, vice chairman of the Energy Training Council in Yukon,
Oklahoma, said in an interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The screening process on new hires has really been ramped
up a lot,&#8221; Strong said. &#8220;We&#8217;re just not seeing nearly as much
hotline traffic about problems on the rigs.&#8221; He didn&#8217;t return a
call to his office in Fort Worth, Texas, today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Macondo Effect &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry is &#8220;more worried&#8221; about safety and liability
since BP Plc&#8217;s 2010 rig disaster at the Macondo well in the Gulf
of Mexico killed 11 workers and provoked a safety crackdown,
John Keller, an analyst at Stephens Inc. in Houston, said today
in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a PR liability, if not a real liability, if some
guy&#8217;s stoned and messes up on a rig,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drug use historically has been a problem among rig workers,
perhaps because of the lack of outside licensing requirements
that govern other jobs, such as truck driving, New said, whose
full-time job is safety manager with Oklahoma City-based Great
White Pressure Control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s hard work,&#8221; said David Pursell, a former petroleum
engineer who&#8217;s now a managing director at Tudor Pickering Holt 
Co. in Houston. &#8220;The pool of folks who want to work in the
oilfield is narrower than a traditional manufacturing
operation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fracking Shale &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Union&#8217;s fleet of 51 land-based rigs focuses mostly on
horizontal drilling, the practice of cutting sideways through a
geologic formation to reach more gas or crude. Extracting fuel
from shale requires the use of horizontal wells and blasting
millions of gallons of high-pressure water, chemicals and sand
to break rock thousands of feet underground, a technique known
as hydraulic fracturing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of rigs drilling horizontal wells (BAKEHORZ) in the U.S.
surged 23 percent in 2011, reaching 1,184 on Dec. 16, the
highest since at least January 1991, according to Baker Hughes
Inc. (BHI), an oilfield-services provider that tracks rig activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Union drills wells in several of the major U.S. shale
formations, including the Fayetteville region of Arkansas and
Oklahoma, and the Marcellus and Utica shales in Appalachia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Holbrook, a spokesman for Irving, Texas-based
Exxon, referred Bloomberg News to the company&#8217;s employee
handbook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drug abuse is grounds for termination and outside
contractors are required to follow the same zero-tolerance
policy, according to the handbook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Union shares fell 2 percent to close at $6.43 in New York.
The stock declined 14 percent in 2011 for its largest annual
drop since 2008. The company is 23 percent-owned by Metalmark
Capital LLC, a private-equity firm owned by Citigroup Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s market share for the
cholesterol pill Lipitor (PHAM1150), now at 41 percent after losing patent
protection last year, will decline further in the next five
months, according to generic-drug maker Watson Pharmaceuticals
Inc. (WPI) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson, producer of a Pfizer-authorized copy of Lipitor,
competes with a generic version made by India&#8217;s Ranbaxy
Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Watson and Ranbaxy entered the U.S. market
on Nov. 11, and have exclusive rights for 180 days before other
manufacturers can sell copies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Bisaro, Watson&#8217;s chief executive officer, today
revised a forecast he made last year that New York-based Pfizer
would hold onto 40 percent of the market once the copycats went
on sale. Pfizer gets revenue from Parsippany, New Jersey-based
Watson&#8217;s version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Their ability to maintain that 40 percent will probably
erode,&#8221; Bisaro said at an investor conference held by Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. in New York. &#8220;History would indicate that it
would come down a little bit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s share of the market was 41 percent as of Dec. 24
for the second week in a row, according to an report from
Bloomberg Industries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer fell less than 1 percent to $21.60 at the close of
New York trading. Watson gained 2.8 percent to $61.99. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)&#8217;s rights agreement with
Walt Disney Co. (DIS) may become the template for how pay-TV companies
strike deals with programmers to defend their subscriber base
against online rivals such as Netflix Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. cable carrier and Disney yesterday reached
a 10-year accord giving Comcast&#8217;s customers access to live and
on-demand content on computers, smartphones and tablets. The
deal lets Comcast subscribers watch real-time programming on ABC
and cable networks including Disney Channel, ABC Family, ESPN
and ESPN2 outside of the home for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comcast benefits from the accord because it motivates
customers to keep their subscriptions, said Craig Moffett, a
Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. analyst in New York. The deal hurts
Netflix (NFLX) and Hulu LLC, whose competitive advantage of offering
content over the Internet will erode, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Comcast and Disney just made a lot of top-shelf content
available out of the home for &#8216;free&#8217; with a subscription to
cable,&#8221; Moffett said. &#8220;That can&#8217;t be good news for the
companies that hope to charge customers for the same
functionality.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The six largest U.S. pay-TV companies lost a net 711,000
video subscribers in the first nine months of 2011 amid gains by
Netflix, Hulu and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), which deliver movies and TV
programs over the Internet for free or a fraction of what cable
companies charge. Disney and Comcast, together with News Corp.
and Providence Equity Partners, are investors in Hulu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Logical Progression&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accord will give Comcast customers access to the Disney
content &#8220;in the coming months,&#8221; said John Demming, a Comcast
spokesman, without giving a specific date. It&#8217;s a &#8220;major step&#8221;
for the evolution of so-called TV Everywhere, a concept giving
pay-TV customers access to programming anywhere, said Bryan Kraft, an analyst at Evercore Partners Inc. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is where the industry is going,&#8221; Kraft said in an
interview. &#8220;You&#8217;re going to see more agreements that allow
distribution of content both inside and outside the home. It&#8217;s
the logical progression.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix declined (NFLX) 1.4 percent to $79.30 at the close in New
York. Comcast added 0.9 percent to $24.95. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix is a complement to cable TV, said Steve Swasey, a
spokesman for the company. Its subscribers will still be able to
&#8220;enjoy the ease of use, low cost and vast catalog of TV shows
and movies available&#8221; even as cable companies strike broader
deals for online rights, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different Apps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix ended the third quarter with 23.8 million U.S.
subscribers. The Los Gatos, California-based company will report
fourth-quarter earnings and customer totals on Jan. 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comcast had 22.4 million video subscribers and 17.8 million
broadband customers as of Sept. 30. The Philadelphia-based
company sees the agreement &#8220;as a template for other deals&#8221;
it&#8217;s negotiating, Neil Smit, president of Comcast Cable, said in
an interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comcast differentiates itself from smaller cable rivals
including Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC) and Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC)
by allowing customers to watch programming out of the home on
its Xfinity TV application. The app has been downloaded
7 million times, Chief Financial Officer Michael Angelakis
said today at a conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time Warner Cable and Cablevision&#8217;s mobile apps only give
subscribers access to in-home live viewing. Comcast is probably
paying more to give customers access anywhere, according to
analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, may receive
$22 billion to $25 billion for ESPN programming alone over the
10 years, said Derek Baine, an analyst at SNL Kagan. The deal
marks the first time Disney-branded cable channels will stream
content to pay-TV customers using mobile devices and computers.
ESPN already had such agreements with 40 million pay-TV homes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Drew Armstrong" date="Jan 05, 2012 12:44 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-05/pfizer-restructures-indian-animal-health-unit-to-prepare-for-consolidation.html"><headline>Pfizer Restructures Indian Animal-Health Unit to Prepare for Consolidation</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, said it will incorporate its Indian subsidiary&#8217;s
animal health unit into its larger animal division, signaling
the company has progressed in its push to divest the business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The action is a step toward worldwide consolidation of New
York-based Pfizer&#8217;s animal health operations under one roof, the
company said. The change was announced in a statement today by
the Bombay Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is shedding its animal health and nutrition
businesses this year as part of Chief Executive Officer Ian Read&#8217;s plan to focus on developing new drugs. The reorganization
will let potential buyers or investors assess the business unit
as a whole, said Scott Rostan, chief executive office of
Training the Street, a New York company that trains finance
professionals, and a former MA banker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is going to be part of the final stages of them
getting serious,&#8221; Rostan said in a phone interview. &#8220;This
would be a clear indication that they&#8217;re proceeding forward.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No decisions have been made as to whether the unit will be
sold, spun off or divested in some other way, said Joan Campion,
a Pfizer spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In order for any potential transaction with animal
health, in some countries the business needs to be separated out
from the legal entity that&#8217;s there,&#8221; she said today in a
telephone interview &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The animal health unit had $3.58 billion in sales in 2010.
Its Asian operations, of which the India subsidiary is part,
were responsible for 14 percent of that total, or about $500
million, according to a company presentation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Ohio&#8217;s largest
lender, said fourth-quarter income was cut by $68 million before
taxes on costs from a bet tied to Visa Inc. (V) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s liability on a swap contract related to Visa
Class B shares increased by $54 million after the card network
deposited $1.57 billion last month to an escrow account as it
prepared to resolve price-fixing accusations. Fifth Third&#8217;s own
litigation reserve is increasing by about $14 million, the
Cincinnati-based lender said today in a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifth Third entered a swap contract as part of its 2009
sale of the Class B shares. The deal required the lender to make
payments to its counterparty because Visa&#8217;s deposit reduced the
value of the shares, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C)&#8217;s Singapore unit sued
Hong Kong-based hedge fund manager Raghavendran Rajaraman,
seeking to recoup $1.03 million in trading losses the bank says
he incurred after gold fell from a record high in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaraman had $19.2 million worth of gold in his account on
Sept. 23 which the bank sold, along with other collateral, on
Sept. 26 &#8220;in the face of a rapidly deteriorating market,&#8221;
leaving a $1 million shortfall, according to a Nov. 18 lawsuit
filed with the Singapore High Court. The first closed hearing is
scheduled for Jan. 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold plunged 11 percent in September, the most since
October 2008, after futures reached a record $1,923.70 an ounce
on Sept. 6. The bank liquidated Rajaraman&#8217;s account after it
reached a so-called forced sell level and got his authorization,
according to court papers. Gold for February delivery in New
York was at $1,601.30 an ounce at 9:55 a.m. Singapore time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaraman works with hedge fund 3 Degrees Asset Management
and was a currency options trader with Citigroup in Singapore
until 2007, according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He hasn&#8217;t filed his defense and didn&#8217;t return three calls
to his mobile-phone. Richard Healy, Rajaraman&#8217;s lawyer at
Oldham, Li  Nie, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We intend to pursue the case and it&#8217;s inappropriate for
us to comment further,&#8221; said Citigroup&#8217;s Singapore-based
spokesman Adam Abdur Rahman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup breached its agreement by closing his account
without prior notice, according to an Oct. 7 letter from Oldham,
Li  Nie to the bank&#8217;s lawyers including William Ong at Allen 
Gledhill LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As a direct consequence of the bank&#8217;s breach,&#8221; Rajaraman
suffered a $1.7 million loss, representing his collateral,
according to the letter. He incurred a further $1.03 million
loss as the bank prematurely liquidated the account instead of
waiting for 24 hours after the account reached the force-sell
level, Rajaraman&#8217;s lawyers said in the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Citibank Singapore Ltd. v Raghavendran
Rajaraman S826/2011 in the Singapore High Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life Partners Sued by SEC for Fraud in Life Settlement Deals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life Partners Holdings Inc. (LPHI) and three top executives are
facing U.S. regulatory claims that they defrauded shareholders
by systematically understating risk related to the firm&#8217;s
purchases of life insurance policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan. 3 the Securities and Exchange Commission said Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Brian D. Pardo, President and
General Counsel R. Scott Peden and Chief Financial Officer David
M. Martin participated in a scheme that misled investors about
the firm&#8217;s profit potential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The senior-most executives at Life Partners concealed
significant risks to the business, manipulated financial
statements with improper accounting, and knowingly profited from
their misconduct by executing insider trades based on
information that was not available to the public,&#8221; David
Woodcock, director of the SEC&#8217;s Fort Worth Regional Office, said
in a statement Jan. 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which buys rights to death benefits from
policyholders in exchange for lump-sum payments, knowingly
underestimated life expectancies used in transactions from 2007
to 2011, the SEC said in its statement. Pardo sold $11.5 million
of stock and Peden sold shares valued at $300,000 while privy to
inside information, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is very disappointing that the SEC has chosen to
pursue litigation over issues that we believe have no merit and
financial presentation issues that we do not believe are
material,&#8221; Pardo, who owns more than 50 percent of the firm&#8217;s
shares, said in a statement. &#8220;We intend to vigorously defend
ourselves against these meritless claims.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls to the company seeking further comment Jan. 3 and
yesterday weren&#8217;t returned. Peden didn&#8217;t respond to a telephone
message left at a residential listing under his name in Woodway,
Texas. A listing couldn&#8217;t be found for Martin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quanta Sues AMD Over Microchips for Notebook Computers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quanta Computer Inc. (2382), the world&#8217;s largest contract maker of
notebook computers, sued Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) for breach
of contract, alleging the chipmaker sold defective products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD and its ATI Technologies Inc. unit sold chips that
didn&#8217;t meet heat tolerances and were unfit for particular
purposes, Taoyuan, Taiwan-based Quanta claimed Jan. 3 in a
federal court filing in San Jose, California. The chips were
used in notebooks Quanta made for NEC Corp. (6701) and caused the
computers to malfunction, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Quanta has suffered significant injury to prospective
revenue and profits,&#8221; the company said in the complaint. Quanta
is seeking a jury trial and damages, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;AMD disputes the allegations in Quanta&#8217;s complaint and
believes they are without merit,&#8221; Sunnyvale, California-based
AMD&#8217;s spokesman, Michael Silverman, said in an e-mailed message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;AMD is aware of no other customer reports of the alleged
issues with the AMD chip that Quanta used, which AMD no longer
sells,&#8221; Silverman said. &#8220;In fact, Quanta has itself
acknowledged to AMD that it used the identical chip in large
volumes in a different computer platform that it manufactured
for NEC without such issues.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Quanta v. Advanced Micro Devices, 12-cv-12,
U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halliburton Denies Destroying Evidence in BP Oil Spill Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halliburton Co. (HAL) denied BP Plc&#8217;s accusation that engineers
destroyed testing evidence to keep it from being used in
litigation over the Gulf of Mexico rig blast that triggered the
worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP and Halliburton are suing each other over whose actions
caused the Macondo well to explode off the Louisiana coast in
April 2010. BP asked U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier of New
Orleans to sanction Halliburton last month, alleging the
cementing services firm hid or destroyed unfavorable testing
evidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halliburton said in a filing yesterday that engineers
followed company policy to discard the testing results and
materials because the tests were &#8220;performed on lab stock that
remains available today.&#8221; Halliburton also said tests on cement
samples like those used in the well showed the formula was
stable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halliburton&#8217;s engineers turned over notes and testified
under oath that tests showed &#8220;a stable foam was observed after
the slurry was conditioned -- a critical fact that BP continues
to ignore,&#8221; Donald Godwin, Halliburton&#8217;s lead trial lawyer,
said in a filing in federal court in New Orleans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We stand by our motions and the arguments we made in
prior papers,&#8221; Daren Beaudo, a spokesman for BP, said in an e-
mail in response to Halliburton&#8217;s filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP and Halliburton have been fighting about the cement job
Halliburton provided to seal the well against leaks, based on
BP&#8217;s design specifications. Halliburton used an innovative
foaming cement formulation that critics claim wasn&#8217;t right for
the Macondo formation. As a result, BP claims the contractor&#8217;s
work was flawed, while Halliburton maintains BP provided faulty
information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Oil Spill by the Oil Rig Deepwater
Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010, MDL-2179, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MF Global Plaintiffs Compete to Lead Lawsuit Against Corzine &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plaintiffs including funds and retirement systems are
competing to lead a lawsuit against Jon Corzine, MF Global
Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ)&#8217;s former chief executive officer, over the
collapse of the commodity brokerage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corzine is the defendant in at least nine lawsuits before a
federal judge in Manhattan that seek compensation for losses
from the company&#8217;s bankruptcy, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero has been combining the
cases into one, saying they make similar claims that Corzine and
other company officials made misleading statements about MF
Global&#8217;s financial condition before its Oct. 31 Chapter 11
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banyon Capital Master Fund Ltd., Virginia and Arkansas
retirement systems and the Building Trades United Pension Trust
Fund all filed separate requests in court yesterday to serve as
lead plaintiff. Yesterday was the deadline for such requests,
according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Levander, a lawyer for Corzine, didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Virginia Retirement System, which wants to lead the
suit together with Canada&#8217;s Province of Alberta, said in a
filing the two together lost more than $19 million on MF Global
stock and debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They asked court approval of their hiring law firms
Bernstein Litowitz Berger  Grossman LLP (142230L), whose cases include a
shareholder suit against BP Plc (BP/) directors and managers, and
Labaton Sucharow LLP, as co-lead counsel for investors suing
Corzine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corzine, the former governor of New Jersey, and senior MF
Global officers touted the company&#8217;s internal financial controls
and liquidity levels in statements that were &#8220;materially
misleading or untrue,&#8221; according to a Nov. 3 complaint filed in
Manhattan federal court by Joseph DeAngelis on behalf of himself
and other MF Global shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeAngelis also named Henri Steenkamp, the New York-based
company&#8217;s chief financial officer, and Bradley Abelow, its
president. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global filed for bankruptcy listing $41 billion in
assets after making bets on European sovereign debt and getting
margin calls. The holding company is the parent of a futures
brokerage that is being liquidated in a separate court
proceeding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main case is DeAngelis v. Corzine, 11-cv-7866, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rajat Gupta Seeks to Have Some Insider-Trading Counts Thrown Out &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajat Gupta, the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) director
charged with insider trading as part of the Galleon Group LLC
probe, asked a judge to dismiss some of the counts against him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government&#8217;s indictment focuses on two instances in
which the U.S. said Galleon co-founder Raj Rajaratnam traded on
information he allegedly received from Gupta, though it
&#8220;improperly uses those two instances to create five purportedly
separate substantive securities-fraud charges,&#8221; according to
Gupta&#8217;s filing in federal court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The five substantive securities fraud counts in the
indictment, because they stem from just two purported unlawful
acts, repeatedly charge what are, at most, two alleged
offenses,&#8221; according to the filing Jan. 3. Gupta asked the
judge to consolidate the charges or order prosecutors to choose
which to pursue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate filing Jan. 3, Gupta asked that prosecutors
be barred from using wiretap evidence. The government intends to
present a &#8220;circumstantial case&#8221; based on the timing of alleged
telephone calls between Gupta and Rajaratnam and recordings the
U.S. obtained by wiretapping Rajaratnam&#8217;s cell phone, according
to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta&#8217;s lawyers said the court&#8217;s rejection of a similar bid
by Rajaratnam to bar the intercepts as evidence during his trial
was incorrect. Federal laws restricting use of wiretaps don&#8217;t
permit them in investigations of suspected insider trading,
according to Gupta&#8217;s filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta, who also sat on the board of Procter  Gamble Co.
and led McKinsey  Co., was indicted by a federal grand jury in
October on five counts of securities fraud and one count of
conspiracy to commit securities fraud for passing inside
information to Rajaratnam. Gupta also faces a lawsuit filed by
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara
in Manhattan, didn&#8217;t immediately return a call seeking comment
on the filings after regular business hours yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, 54, was convicted in May of directing the
biggest insider-trading ring in a generation. His 11-year prison
term was the longest sentence ever handed down for such a crime
and the culmination of a four-year nationwide probe of insider
trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Gupta, 11-cr-00907, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CFTC Asks Court to Dismiss Challenge to Position Limits Rule &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission asked a
federal appeals court to dismiss a challenge by two Wall Street
groups to its rule that limits commodity speculation, one of the
financial industry&#8217;s highest-profile efforts to weaken last
year&#8217;s Dodd-Frank law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CFTC filed its request yesterday in the U.S. Court of
Appeals in Washington, arguing the appeals court doesn&#8217;t have
jurisdiction to consider the lawsuit. The agency said that the
district court must first consider a challenge to the rule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc.
and Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association filed
lawsuits in two federal courts in Washington last month, arguing
that the CFTC used a flawed analysis of Dodd-Frank when it
decided to impose the restrictions. The associations also said
the CFTC failed to properly weigh the rule&#8217;s costs and benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to questions from the district court judge, the
groups said last month they didn&#8217;t oppose putting the district
court case on hold while the appeals court considers the
challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is International Swaps and Derivatives Association
v. CFTC, 11-01491, is U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford&#8217;s Defense Experts Paid, Ordered to Remain on Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R. Allen Stanford&#8217;s defense experts were ordered to
continue defending the former financier in a $7 billion
investment fraud case by a U.S. appellate court that also agreed
to pay their back wages, according to court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of Stanford&#8217;s non-attorney experts quit last week after
appellate judges controlling the former billionaire&#8217;s taxpayer-
funded defense budget said they would limit and withhold the
experts&#8217; compensation until after conclusion of his trial, set
to begin Jan. 23 in Houston federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It would be neither feasible nor economical to obtain a
replacement to perform the services Marcum was expected by
counsel to provide,&#8221; Circuit Judge Edith Jones, the chief of
the U.S. Court of Appeals in New Orleans, said in a letter
yesterday to Marcum LLP, one of the expert contractors that
resigned last week from Stanford&#8217;s defense team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jones issued similar orders and agreements to pay overdue
invoices to two other expert-services contractors to keep them
working on Stanford&#8217;s defense. Accumyn Consulting and the Worley
Group had also resigned last week over non-payment of bills
dating back to September, according to court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ali Fazel, Stanford&#8217;s lead criminal-defense attorney, said
the defense was hampered by the resignation of all expert-
services contractors on Dec. 30, after the appellate court
balked at paying their bills. Jones, in her letters yesterday,
said billings by Marcum and Accumyn feature &#8220;hourly rates
significantly in excess of the rates payable under the Criminal
Justice Act to even the most experienced attorneys.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford, 61, has been in custody as a flight risk since he
was indicted in June 2009 on charges of defrauding investors
through allegedly bogus certificates of deposit at his Antigua-
based Stanford International Bank. He denies any wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. Stanford, 09cr342, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston). The SEC
case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Stanford
International Bank, 09cv298, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of Texas (Dallas). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-UBS Wealth CEO Failed to Act on Risk Failures, FSA Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Pottage, the former chief executive officer of UBS
AG (UBSN)&#8217;s wealth-management unit in the U.K., didn&#8217;t heed warning
signs that risk controls in the division were ineffective before
an unauthorized trading loss was discovered, the U.K.&#8217;s finance
regulator said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pottage, now a senior executive at the bank&#8217;s headquarters
in Zurich, should have started a review of controls after a
client-money breach, a payment fraud, and other failings were
discovered, the Financial Services Authority said in court
papers. He also should have done an &#8220;adequate initial
assessment&#8221; of the unit&#8217;s controls after becoming CEO, a lawyer
for the FSA said at a trial in London yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pottage&#8217;s actions constituted a regulatory breach, FSA
lawyer Andrew Hochhauser said in the first day of closing
arguments in the case, where the ex-CEO is challenging a 100,000
pound ($156,000) fine. The case is the first time the regulator
has sought to penalize an executive for oversight failures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pottage said in court papers he worked to improve systems
and controls in the unit when he started as CEO in September
2006 and doesn&#8217;t deserve a fine. Pottage, who moved to Zurich
amid the FSA probe, denies the charge that he should&#8217;ve acted
sooner than he did to review weaknesses in the systems and
controls, and &#8220;is supported in that denial by UBS,&#8221; his
lawyers have said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pottage testified during the three-week hearing that he was
&#8220;confused&#8221; by the regulator&#8217;s attempt to fine him and that he
thought it didn&#8217;t understand his role at the bank. He said
during a meeting with the regulator in 2009 that he was
&#8220;concerned that the interviewer thought the CEO was a fully
empowered individual.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Bid to Dismiss $18 Billion Award Rejected in Ecuador &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s effort to overturn an $18 billion judgment
against it was rejected by an Ecuador appeals court in a lawsuit
alleging the company is responsible for chemicals spilled in the
Amazon River basin more than 20 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;adverse ruling&#8221; upholding the lower-court judgment
was issued by a panel of three judges in the Provincial Court of
Justice of Sucumbios in Lago Agrio, Ecuador, Chevron said in an
e-mailed statement Jan. 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron appealed a February ruling that it was responsible
for chemical-laden wastewater dumped in jungle land from 1964 to
about 1992 by Texaco Inc., which Chevron acquired in 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;decision is another glaring example of the
politicization and corruption of Ecuador&#8217;s judiciary that has
plagued this fraudulent case from the start,&#8221; Chevron said in
its statement. The company &#8220;does not believe that the Ecuador
ruling is enforceable in any court that observes the rule of
law.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court ratified the February ruling &#8220;in all of
its parts, including the conviction for moral reparation or its
alternative and costs,&#8221; according to the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron is still reviewing the ruling and hasn&#8217;t decided
what it will do next, Kent Robertson, a spokesman for the San
Ramon, California-based company, said Jan. 3 in a phone
interview. He said the company &#8220;has a procedural right to seek
clarification and amplification from the court that issued this
ruling.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron can also appeal the decision to the next level of
Ecuador&#8217;s judiciary, Robertson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karen Hinton, a spokeswoman for lawyers representing the
Ecuador residents who sued Chevron, said in an e-mailed
statement, &#8220;The decision by an independent appellate court is
yet further confirmation of Chevron&#8217;s extraordinary greed and
criminal misconduct in Ecuador.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Must Pay $45 Million in Prempro Cases, Court Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) must pay more than $45 million in damages to
two women who blamed the company&#8217;s menopause drugs for their
breast cancers, an appeals court ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connie Barton and Donna Kendall, two Illinois women who
sued Pfizer units Wyeth and Pharmacia  Upjohn over their
menopause medications, deserved both compensatory and punitive
damages over the companies&#8217; handling of the drugs, a panel of
the Pennsylvania Superior Court ruled Jan. 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are very disappointed with the court&#8217;s decisions in
these cases and continue to believe there was no basis in fact
or law for the jury verdicts,&#8221; Chris Loder, a spokesman for New
York-based Pfizer, said in an e-mailed statement. Pfizer
officials will ask the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to review the
lower court&#8217;s findings, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 6 million women took Prempro and related
menopause drugs to treat symptoms including hot flashes and mood
swings before a 2002 study highlighted their links to cancer. At
one point, Pfizer and its units faced more than 10,000 lawsuits
over the medications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a great way to start 2012 for these two brave
women,&#8221; Zoe Littlepage, one of Barton&#8217;s lawyers, said in a
telephone interview yesterday. Under the appellate ruling,
Barton would get a total of $11.2 million while Kendall would
get $34.3 million, Littlepage said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the height of the litigation, Pfizer faced more than
10,000 claims that its menopause drugs caused breast cancer,
according to lawyers for former users. Those lawsuits included
more than 8,000 cases consolidated in federal court in Arkansas
and suits in state courts in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Minnesota. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has begun settling some suits and has set aside
$840 million so far to resolve cases, officials said in
November. Pfizer has resolved about 46 percent of the pending
Prempro suits, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Barton v. Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc.,
040406301, Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County,
Pennsylvania (Philadelphia). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-LyondellBasell Employee Gets 7-Year Sentence in Kickbacks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-LyondellBasell Industries NV (LYB) employee Jonathan Paul
Barnes was sentenced to seven years in prison on fraud and
money-laundering charges in a kickback scheme involving oil
shipments to the company&#8217;s Texas refinery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnes, 56, was sentenced yesterday in Houston federal
court by U.S. District Judge Sim Lake, who also ordered Barnes
to pay $82 million in restitution, federal prosecutors said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnes pleaded guilty in March to accepting about $20
million in kickbacks while managing marine chartering for
Lyondell&#8217;s Houston refinery from 2007 to early 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He acknowledged running a scheme that overcharged
Lyondell&#8217;s Houston subsidiary roughly $82 million on oil
shipments from Venezuela, according to court papers. He was
assisted by two oil traders, Bernard Langley, 54, of the U.K.,
and Clyde Meltzer, 65, of Houston and Livingston, N.J. Both have
pleaded guilty to funneling kickbacks to Barnes and are awaiting
sentencing in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The United States has already seized assets purchased
with proceeds from the kickback fraud that are valued at
approximately $20 million,&#8221; Kenneth Magidson, the U.S. Attorney
for Houston, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seized assets included real estate in Houston, Florida
and upstate New York and &#8220;more than 15 luxury and classic
vehicles including a 1957 Cadillac once owned by Frank Sinatra,
a boat and numerous pieces of high-end jewelry,&#8221; Magidson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The kickback scheme was uncovered during an internal
audit, which raised questions about certain marine chartering
costs which appeared to deviate from the industry norm,&#8221; David
Harpole, Lyondell&#8217;s Houston spokesman, said in an e-mail in
response to yesterday&#8217;s sentencing.  He said that when an
internal investigation disclosed apparent kickbacks, the company
&#8220;took immediate steps to address the matter,&#8221; including firing
Barnes and referring the matter for criminal investigation by
the Justice Department&#8217;s Houston division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rusty Hardin, Barnes&#8217;s lawyer, didn&#8217;t respond to a call
seeking comment on yesterday&#8217;s sentence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Barnes, 4:10-cr-0787, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Florida Foreclosure Lawyer Stern Sued by DJSP Enterprises &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Stern, the Florida foreclosure lawyer who profited
off the state&#8217;s housing bust before losing his biggest clients,
was sued by a partner company that claims it was damaged by
Stern&#8217;s foreclosure practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DJSP Enterprises Inc. (DJSP), which took on the non-legal
foreclosure-processing services of Stern&#8217;s law firm and depended
on his referrals, said in a copy of a complaint included in a
regulatory filing dated Jan. 3 that Stern concealed his business
was &#8220;systematically engaging in unlawful and fraudulent
conduct&#8221; in foreclosures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those practices jeopardized Stern&#8217;s relationships with his
biggest clients, including banks and government mortgage
companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the viability of his
law firm and DJSP, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DJSP said the complaint was filed Jan. 3 in Broward County,
Florida. The filing of the suit couldn&#8217;t be immediately
confirmed with the court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Tew, a lawyer for Stern, said his client would
fight the claims. Stern&#8217;s law firm has stopped handling
foreclosure cases, according to Tew. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t think the allegations are well founded,&#8221; he
said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brokerage Trustee Seeks $24.3 Million for Four Months &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trustee liquidating the Lehman Brothers Inc. (LEHMQ) brokerage
is seeking $24.3 million in fees for himself and his law firm
for the four months through June, plus expenses of about
$299,916. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Giddens, who also is liquidating the MF Global Inc. (MF)
broker-dealer, asked a judge to approve the fees for Lehman work
Jan.3in his eighth request in the three years since the Lehman
parent filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history. Prior fees
and expenses approved for the trustee and his firm, Hughes
Hubbard  Reed LLP (1218L), total $145.6 million, according to a filing
yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giddens worked 468 hours at $891 an hour for $417,255 in
fees during the four-month period, out of more than 51,000 hours
billed by the firm, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giddens plans to start paying the Lehman brokerage&#8217;s
remaining customers, mostly hedge funds and institutions, early
next year from available assets of $18.3 billion, he said last
month. He didn&#8217;t say how much money customers can expect, only
that his goal was to make &#8220;a significant&#8221; payment. Large
payouts must await the resolution of remaining disputes over
claims filed against the defunct brokerage, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By law, Giddens must share the assets equally among
customers. He has gathered $23.7 billion to pay customers from
settlements, litigation and negotiations with banks and other
business partners, according to court records. He is holding $3
billion of the total in reserve for a court fight with Barclays
Plc (BARC), which in 2008 bought North American businesses of the
brokerage&#8217;s parent, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lehman brokerage liquidation is Securities Investor
Protection Corp. v. Lehman Brothers Inc., 08-01420, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan probably recorded its first
annual trade deficit (JNTBAL) since 1963 last year, part of a shift that
may see the world&#8217;s largest net creditor come to rely on inflows
of foreign capital by 2015, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If foreigners don&#8217;t believe Japan&#8217;s fiscal situation will
improve, Japan could become like Greece,&#8221; said Masaaki Kanno,
chief economist at JPMorgan in Tokyo. &#8220;We&#8217;re getting poorer as
the trade deficit increases.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s ability to keep borrowing costs the second lowest
in the world depends on its position as a net holder of external
assets. A drop in savings as babyboomers dip into retirement
funds and as a strong yen erodes company profits could push the
nation&#8217;s current-account surplus (JNBPAB) into a deficit, making it more
expensive for the country to borrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Japan has a shortfall, the government must reassure
investors of Japan&#8217;s creditworthiness or risk seeing an increase
in bond yields, said Kanno, a former chief foreign-exchange
dealer at the Bank of Japan. A failure by Prime Minister
Yoshihiko Noda to bolster the nation&#8217;s 5 percent sales tax could
shake investor confidence, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan retained its rank as largest net holder of external
assets for a 20th straight year in 2010, with a position of
251.5 trillion yen ($3.3 trillion), according to the finance
ministry. Figures for 2011 are due in May. Japan&#8217;s 10-year
government bond yield, at 0.985 percent today, is the
second lowest in the world after Switzerland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current Account &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s third-largest economy had a current-account
surplus of 562.4 billion yen in October, the latest data
available, while posting a trade deficit of 273.8 billion yen in
the same period. The current account tracks the flow of goods,
services and investment income between Japan and its trading
partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appreciation of the yen against the dollar also erodes
Japan&#8217;s current-account surplus by making the country&#8217;s goods
more expensive abroad. The yen has gained 8.5 percent against
the dollar in the past year and reached a postwar high of 75.35
on Oct. 31. It traded at 76.73 per dollar as of 2 p.m. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan estimates a 1 percent gain in the yen could reduce
the export volumes by 0.34 percent, damping growth for a country
that has relied on overseas demand to sustain its recovery from
last March&#8217;s earthquake. According to JPMorgan calculations, a
global expansion at 4 percent and a 5 percent drop in the yen
would be necessary to stop a future expansion of the trade
deficit, a situation that Kanno says is &#8220;unlikely.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s current-account surplus could move into a deficit
sooner than 2015 if more companies shift production abroad,
Kanno said. Over 75 percent of Japanese cars will be produced
abroad by 2014, up from 67 percent in 2011, JPMorgan estimates.
Nissan Motor Corp. and Elpida Memory Inc. indicated last year
they will increase production abroad to combat losses from a
strong yen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese authorities have signaled they are concerned about
a further appreciation of the yen. The Finance Ministry said
last month it plans to increase the funds available for currency
intervention to 195 trillion yen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Doug Alexander and Sean B. Pasternak" date="Jan 05, 2012 12:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-05/cibc-leads-canadian-banks-for-mergers-ousting-goldman-sachs.html"><headline>CIBC Leads Canadian Banks for Mergers, Ousting Goldman Sachs</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;CIBC (CM) led Canada&#8217;s investment banks in
advising on Canadian mergers last year, ousting foreign firms
such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan Stanley from the
top-three spots for the first time in at least a dozen years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce&#8217;s investment bank worked
on 38 deals valued at $36.1 billion, including advising Equinox
Minerals Ltd. on its sale to Barrick Gold Corp., according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Bank of Montreal (BMO)&#8217;s BMO Capital
Markets was second, followed by Royal Bank of Canada (RY)&#8217;s RBC
Capital Markets. JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) was fourth and Toronto-
Dominion Bank was fifth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canadian companies were involved in 2,300 announced
takeovers valued at $177.5 billion last year, down 11 percent
from almost $200 billion in 2010, according to Bloomberg data.
The figures are as of yesterday and subject to change as more
deals are recorded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was a reasonable year for MA activity, but certainly
below where we&#8217;ve seen in terms of a peak in the market,&#8221; Mike Boyd, CIBC (CM)&#8217;s head of mergers and acquisitions, said in an
interview from Toronto. &#8220;I expect we&#8217;ll see a stronger year for
MA in 2012.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year was the first time in at least a dozen years that
Canadian banks blocked foreign firms from a top-three spot for
advising on Canadian takeovers, Bloomberg data show. In 2010,
New York-based Goldman Sachs ranked first, followed by Zurich-
based UBS AG and London-based Barclays Plc (BARC), with BMO Capital
Markets in fourth. Morgan Stanley, based in New York, ranked No.
1 in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CIBC Surge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada&#8217;s dominance may be in part due to an increase in
mining deals last year, said Peter Buzzi, head of mergers in
Canada with RBC Capital, a unit of Canada&#8217;s largest bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;U.S. firms are less active on the mining side on a
relative basis to the Canadian firms because it&#8217;s never been a
sector in the U.S. that&#8217;s been significant,&#8221; said Buzzi, 51,
whose firm moved up from sixth spot in 2010. &#8220;That&#8217;s really one
industry where the Canadian investment banks dominate
globally.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrea Rachman, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, declined to comment. Pen Pendleton,
a spokesman for Morgan Stanley (MS), the sixth-largest U.S. bank,
also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barrick Takeover &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBC advised Barrick on its $7.81 billion takeover of
Equinox, Canada&#8217;s biggest mining deal in 2011 and the second-
largest takeover involving a Canadian company last year. Other
mining deals in 2011 included Cliffs Natural Resources Inc.&#8217;s
$4.48 billion agreement to buy Montreal-based Consolidated
Thompson Iron Mines Ltd., and Eldorado Gold Corp.&#8217;s agreement
last month to buy European Goldfields Ltd. for about $2.54
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CIBC, the top adviser in 2008, jumped to No. 1 from ninth
in 2010, according to Bloomberg data. BMO Capital Markets, a
unit of Canada&#8217;s fourth-biggest bank, cracked the top three for
the first time in more than a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We achieved record MA revenues in our business last year
in Canada and in the United States,&#8221; William Butt, 49, head of
global investment and corporate banking at BMO Capital, said in
an interview in Toronto. &#8220;Our overall MA revenues are the
highest we&#8217;ve ever seen in our firm.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of Canada&#8217;s three largest announced deals involved
Canadian pension funds, with Canada Pension Plan Investment
Board the country&#8217;s most acquisitive firm. Canada Pension, the
country&#8217;s second-biggest retirement fund, was involved in 19
deals valued at $15.8 billion, including a bank-and-pension
fund-led bid to buy Toronto Stock Exchange owner TMX Group Inc.
and the sale of Skype Technologies SA to Microsoft Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skype Sale &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $8.5 billion Skype sale in October was Canada&#8217;s largest
deal, according to Bloomberg. Canada Pension, which more than
tripled its $300 million Skype investment in two years, was
among a group of Skype investors that included U.S. private
equity firm Silver Lake Management LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada&#8217;s third-largest deal was the $5.73 billion takeover
of Kinetic Concepts Inc. by Apax Partners LLP, along with Canada
Pension and Public Sector Pension Investment Board, which closed
in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re going to continue to see private equity funds and
pension funds be more active, given the strength in the debt
markets and the relatively lower cost of capital for them,&#8221;
said Boyd of CIBC, a unit of Canada&#8217;s fifth-biggest bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top Acquirers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average disclosed deal size was $132 million and the
average premium was 30 percent, according to Bloomberg data.
Canadian companies were the top acquirers in their own country,
representing $118.6 billion of the deals, followed by U.S.
firms, which invested $51 billion in Canadian companies, the
data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mergers and acquisitions may pick up in 2012, with more
deals and larger transactions because corporate balance sheets
are in &#8220;good shape&#8221; and capital to fund takeovers is available
at a low cost, Boyd said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Canadian economy is still performing relatively well,
despite the challenges in Europe and elsewhere,&#8221; Boyd said.
&#8220;We&#8217;re continuing to see demand in interest for the resource
sectors in Canada, both mining and oil and gas.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year will be &#8220;a strong year&#8221; though not a record for
Canadian takeovers, Andre Hidi, head of global mergers and
acquisitions for BMO Capital Markets, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The sectors that have been busiest over the last couple
of years are, quite frankly, likely to continue, and that&#8217;s
mining and metals,&#8221; Hidi, 51, said. &#8220;There&#8217;s probably going to
be more breadth across sectors including financial services,
media, consumer, retail, industrial and power.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nokia Oyj (NOK) will unveil its first
Windows Phone for ATT Inc. (T) at the Consumer Electronics Show
Jan. 9, two people familiar with the matter said, boosting an
effort by Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) to regain market share lost to Apple
Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia and ATT, the second-largest U.S. wireless carrier,
will announce plans to begin selling the Nokia Ace in the coming
months, said the people, who declined to be identified because
the arrangements are private. The handset will be the first
Windows Phone to use the next-generation wireless technology
known as long term evolution, or LTE, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT is set to become the biggest U.S. carrier to announce
a Nokia Windows handset, underscoring the agreement&#8217;s importance
to Microsoft. Nokia is working to revive sales after it lost the
title of worldwide No. 1 smartphone maker to Samsung Electronics
Co. (005930) in the third quarter, according to researcher Gartner Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nokia Ace will run the newest version of the Windows
Phone software, one of the people said. While the price hasn&#8217;t
been finalized, the device may sell for $249 with a two-year
contract, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT is ahead of schedule expanding its LTE network, with
service in 26 U.S. cities, John Stankey, head of business
solutions at the Dallas-based company, said this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphone Buyers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, T-Mobile USA Inc. announced it would offer the
Lumia 710, the first Nokia phone to run Windows Phone software
in the U.S. The device, targeting first-time smartphone buyers,
will cost $49.99 after a $50 rebate and with a 24-month
contract. It will be available Jan. 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google&#8217;s Android boosted its share of the smartphone
operating-system market to more than 50 percent in the third
quarter, according to Gartner, more than double its share from a
year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Espoo, Finland-based Nokia has revamped its smartphone
business around the Windows Phone operating system. The company
began selling Lumia phones in Europe and Asia last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dawn Beauparlant, a spokeswoman for Redmond, Washington-
based Microsoft, declined to comment. Doug Dawson, a spokesman
for Nokia, and Mark Siegel, a spokesman for ATT, also both
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plans by Nokia and Microsoft to unveil the phone were
reported by the Supersite for Windows blog on Dec. 29. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chicago gasoline strengthened for the
first time in four days after Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) shut a coker
compressor at the Joliet (XOJOCRUD) oil refinery in Illinois. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in Chicago (CHCG87PC) jumped 6.5
cents to trade at a 2.5-cent premium to gasoline futures on the
New York Mercantile Exchange, the first premium in almost two
months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg at 4:25 p.m. in
New York. Prompt-delivery of the fuel in Chicago rose 8.01 cents
to $2.7766 a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of independents out in this area, and the
minute they hear something go down, they&#8217;re buying,&#8221; Phil Flynn, an analyst with PFGBest in Chicago, said during a
telephone interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s definitely a buy-first-and-ask-
questions-later area.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irving, Texas-based Exxon shut a compressor at the 238,000-
barrel-a-day Joliet refinery coker&#8217;s main fractionator two days
ago, according to a filing with the National Response Center.
The compressor was returned to service and production at the
plant wasn&#8217;t affected, Tricia Simpson, a spokeswoman for the
refinery, said in an e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultra-low-sulfur diesel in Chicago (CHCGUTLS) was unchanged at a
discount of 13.5 cents to heating oil futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast (MOSGC87P) widened 0.25 cent to 5 cents versus futures. The same
fuel in New York (MOSNY87P) fell 0.12 cent to a discount of 1.13 cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the Midwest (GRP3G387) gained 1.25
cents to a 19.25-cent discount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend gasoline, known as Carbob, in Los Angeles (MOGLDB85)
strengthened for the first time in four days, by 0.12 cent to a
premium of 12.25 cents against futures. The same fuel in San
Francisco (MOGSD85P) also climbed 0.12 cent to 8.25 cents above futures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s bid to protect assets
that could be seized as part of an $18 billion environmental
damages verdict against it in Ecuador was denied by a U.S.
judge, who said the request could be renewed at a later date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, asked U.S.
District Judge Lewis Kaplan in New York to block the collection
of the judgment and the &#8220;dissipating&#8221; of any proceeds pending
resolution of a lawsuit alleging that the plaintiffs engaged in
fraud to win the Ecuadorean judgment. The company sought to
&#8220;temporarily ensure the availability&#8221; of all assets while the
U.S. case proceeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron has made no effort to quantify the damages it
alleged has been sustained to date, let alone to support any
damage claim with evidence,&#8221; Kaplan said in his ruling today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron was ordered on Feb. 14 to pay as much as
$18 billion in compensatory and punitive damages for Texaco
Inc.&#8217;s alleged dumping of toxic drilling wastes in the
Ecuadorean jungle from 1964 to about 1992. The ruling came in an
18-year-old lawsuit decided by a judge in Lago Agrio, a
provincial capital near the Colombian border. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full Opinion &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Jan. 3, an Ecuadorean appeals court upheld the February
ruling &#8220;in all of its parts, including the conviction for moral
reparation or its alternative and costs,&#8221; according to the
decision. Chevron can appeal the decision to the next level of
Ecuador&#8217;s judiciary, a company spokesman said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A U.S. appeals panel in September rejected Kaplan&#8217;s March
decision blocking collection of the Ecuadorean judgment. The
appeals court hasn&#8217;t issued a full opinion in the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron denies wrongdoing in the Lago Agrio lawsuit. The
company says Texaco cleaned up its share of the pollution at its
former oil fields, which were taken over by PetroEcuador,
Ecuador&#8217;s state-owned oil company. Chevron says it was released
from any future liability by an agreement between Texaco and
Ecuador. Chevron acquired Texaco in 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The San Ramon, California-based company alleged in a U.S.
suit before Kaplan that lawyers for the Ecuadoreans conspired to
fabricate evidence. Attorneys for the Latin American plaintiffs
said the lawsuit is an unjustified attempt to derail the
pollution lawsuit damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Narrow Grounds&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kent Robertson, a spokesman for Chevron, said in an e-mail
that &#8220;we appreciate the court&#8217;s prompt response to our motion.
The court decided the motion on very narrow grounds and did not
question the strength of Chevron&#8217;s fraud evidence. Clearly the
court has left the door open to a future attachment filing. We
look forward to the balance of our racketeering case proceeding
and remain committed to holding the plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers
accountable for their misconduct.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karen Hinton, a U.S. spokeswoman for the Ecuadorean
plaintiffs, said in an e-mail that &#8220;it is clear that Chevron&#8217;s
motion had no legal basis and was designed yet again to distract
attention from the company&#8217;s fraudulent misconduct in Ecuador as
well as its obligation to clean up its toxic waste in Ecuador&#8217;s
Amazon that threatens the lives of thousands of people.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The racketeering case is Chevron v. Donziger, 11-00691,
U.S. District Court, District of New York (Manhattan). The case
in Ecuador is Maria Aquinda v. Chevron, 002-2003, Superior Court
of Nueva Loja, Lago Agrio, Ecuador. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL) is becoming a favorite of
information technology departments, with the popularity of the
iPad and Mac computers eroding what businesses are spending on
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) machines, according to a new report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cupertino, California-based company will sell $10
billion worth of iPads and $9 billion of Mac computers to
enterprise customers this year, a 58 percent jump, Forrester
Research Inc. (FORR) said in its global IT market outlook report. By
contrast, computers and tablets running Microsoft&#8217;s Windows
software will decline 3 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple is the &#8220;biggest disruptive force in the computer
equipment market,&#8221; Forrester said in the report released today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is leading the so-called consumerization of IT,
in which people use technology gadgets for both personal and
work tasks. By expanding its leadership in consumer electronics
to business customers, Apple is bucking a global slowdown in IT
spending. Forrester estimates that global IT purchases will rise
5 percent to $2.12 trillion in 2012, versus last year&#8217;s 10
percent growth rate, as companies ratchet back spending amid a
sluggish global economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple doesn&#8217;t break down how much of its sales are from
business customers, though in October it said that 92 percent of
Fortune 500 companies are testing or deploying the iPad.
Forrester said that Apple isn&#8217;t doing much to drive the sales
and that businesses are adopting its devices because of their
popularity for personal use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Apple assault on the corporate market has so far
taken place without much formal Apple support, and probably with
Apple itself understanding its full extent,&#8221; Forrester said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft software and Intel Corp. (INTC) semiconductors still
dominate the corporate market. Businesses are projected to buy
$69 billion worth of Windows-Intel PCs and tablets in 2012, and
$68 billion in 2013, the report said. Apple&#8217;s Mac and iPad sales
to businesses will total $28 billion in 2013, according to
Forrester. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stock prices are being increasingly
influenced by the trading of exchange-traded funds, with real
estate investment trusts as well as energy and consumer
companies most affected, according to a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REITs and energy companies accounted for eight of the top
10 firms in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index whose trading volume
was most driven by trading in ETFs, Robert D. Boroujerdi, a
Goldman Sachs analyst, and three colleagues wrote in a paper
released today. Consumer retailers accounted for the five most
affected companies in the Russell 2000 Index, which tracks
small-capitalization stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ETFs have come under increased scrutiny in the past two
years over whether their trading has increased market volatility
and correlation between individual stocks. The growing impact of
ETF trading on the price movements of individual stocks has
discouraged some companies from publicly listing, according to
Harold Bradley, chief investment officer at the nonprofit Ewing
Marion Kauffman Foundation, who testified in October before a
Senate subcommittee examining the impact of the products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs analysis is aimed at showing investment
managers &#8220;which sectors are most conducive to single-stock
selection and which are more macro bets,&#8221; Boroujerdi, the New
York firm&#8217;s co-director of Americas equity research, said in an
e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ETF Assets Soar &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ETFs, including exchange-traded notes and trusts, held
$1.54 trillion in assets worldwide at the end of November,
according to data compiled by New York-based BlackRock Inc. (BLK) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correlation between the share prices of companies within
the same industry groups has increased as ETF assets and trading
volume have soared, the study said. Higher correlations indicate
that stock prices are rising or falling in tandem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global ETF assets rose 70 percent from the end of 2007
through November 2011, faster than mutual fund assets, which are
roughly in line with their 2007 levels, Goldman Sachs said,
citing data from the Investment Company Institute and BlackRock.
While equity ETFs have less than 10 percent of assets held by
their mutual-fund counterparts, they account for 25 percent to
30 percent of total equity dollar trading volume. That volume is
up from 10 percent to 15 percent in 2004, according to the
study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sector ETFs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ETF investors tend to concentrate their industry-focused
bets in relatively few products, according to the study. The 20
most heavily traded ETFs that invest in a specific industry
accounted for 85 percent of the total average daily value traded
among all U.S.-listed sector ETFs with assets of at least $100
million, Goldman Sachs said, citing data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies included in three of the four most actively
traded industry ETFs showed a higher correlation at the end of
2011 than during the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, the
study said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report examines the relationship between ETFs and
correlation on an industry group level &#8220;and there is an
impact,&#8221; Boroujerdi said in the e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage Stores, FMC &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs analysts also estimated the impact of
ETFs on the trading volume of individual stocks. Smaller
companies were more affected. Among Russell 2000 companies,
three had more than 60 percent of their volume driven by ETF
trading, led by Houston-based retailer Stage Stores Inc. (SSI) at 66
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among SP 500 companies, Houston-based FMC Technologies
Inc. (FTI), an offshore-drilling technology firm, topped the list with
an estimated 23 percent of volume driven by ETF trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study didn&#8217;t examine the impact from trading in
leveraged ETFs, which make use of derivatives to amplify their
bets, or those that are predominantly based in swaps, futures or
other non-single equity securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all ETFs invest shareholder money in a basket of
stocks, bonds or commodities that tracks the performance of an
index. Unlike mutual funds, their shares trade throughout the
day on an exchange like stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Michael J. Moore" date="Jan 06, 2012 11:41 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-06/goldman-sachs-morgan-stanley-profit-estimates-reduced-on-trading-outlook.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley Profit Estimates Reduced on Trading Outlook</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan
Stanley (MS), the major U.S. banks most reliant on trading, had their
earnings estimates reduced by analysts as a weak fourth quarter
dimmed prospects for a capital-markets rebound in the first half
of 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanford C. Bernstein&#8217;s Brad Hintz cut his fourth-quarter
estimate for Goldman Sachs by 76 percent and almost quadrupled
his expected loss for Morgan Stanley as &#8220;already anxious
clients grew increasingly cautious,&#8221; he wrote in a note to
investors today. Doug Sipkin, an analyst at Ticonderoga
Securities LLC, lowered his 2012 Goldman Sachs estimate by 23
percent on a more pessimistic view of the firm&#8217;s fixed-income
trading revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two New York-based banks will probably still more than
double their earnings per share this year, according to analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. The firms&#8217; 2011 results (GS) are likely to
fall short of estimates made at the start of last year on a
decline in trading volume, concern that the European debt crisis
would spread and one-time items such as preferred-share
redemptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the threat emanating from Europe will dominate
customer activity, and we see little hope of any resolution in
the first half of the year,&#8221; Hintz wrote. &#8220;Regulatory concerns
and the overall pace of the global economic recovery pose
incremental headwinds for the large brokerage firms.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through 2013 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan (JPM) Cazenove analysts led by Kian Abouhossein cut
their earnings outlook for investment banks for 2011, 2012 and
2013, citing worsening conditions in fixed income and equities.
In a note today, the analysts lowered their Goldman Sachs 2012
estimate by 19 percent and Morgan Stanley&#8217;s figure by 17
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hintz reduced his fourth-quarter estimate for Goldman Sachs
to 77 cents a share, from $3.15, and Morgan Stanley to a loss of
75 cents, from a 19-cent loss. Sipkin dropped his Goldman Sachs
fourth-quarter estimate to 97 cents, from $4.12, and now expects
a 59-cent loss for Morgan Stanley, after previously estimating a
40-cent profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiona Swaffield, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote
in a note yesterday that she has cut her 2012 earnings estimates
for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley by 27 percent and 33
percent, respectively, since June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return on Equity &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &#8220;lackluster&#8221; estimated revenue increase has led to
concerns about the long-term return on equity investment banks
can produce, Swaffield wrote. Investment-banking divisions
likely had ROE of 5 percent to 9 percent in 2011, when measured
against risk-weighted assets calculated under new capital rules
known as Basel 3, she wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lowered earnings expectations didn&#8217;t change the
analysts&#8217; stock ratings (GS). Abouhossein rates Goldman Sachs and
Morgan Stanley &#8220;overweight.&#8221; Hintz has an &#8220;outperform&#8221;
rating on both and wrote that &#8220;current valuation levels imply a
near worst case scenario for these stocks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein,
57, said in November that global growth will &#8220;snap back&#8221;
faster than most forecasters expect. He said he didn&#8217;t know when
that will happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some analysts still see reason for optimism for a rebound
in investment-banking and trading revenue, which has likely
fallen in each of the past two years. In 2011, global stock
offerings plunged 29 percent from 2010 and U.S. bond issuance
fell 6.7 percent as companies delayed plans to raise capital,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Handful of Catalysts&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see a handful of catalysts -- like plenty of cash on
the sidelines, a pickup in MA activity, large investment-
banking backlogs&#8221; and the need for hedge funds to try to
outperform their benchmarks, Glenn Schorr, an analyst at Nomura
Holdings Inc., wrote in a note today. &#8220;That could boost
activity levels over the next few quarters.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that pickup doesn&#8217;t occur, investment banks may chop
more jobs, Abouhossein said. Morgan Stanley said last month that
it&#8217;s eliminating 1,600 positions, and Goldman Sachs said in July
it would cut headcount (GS) by about 1,000. Staffing at U.S. and
European investment banks could fall 5 percent to 10 percent by
the second half of 2012, Abouhossein wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The response of the banks to the lower revenue
environment has been less robust than we would have hoped to
date,&#8221; Swaffield wrote. &#8220;So far in 2011, headcount is down to
a limited extent versus 2007 pre-crisis, yet revenues are down
on average by a third.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rajat Gupta, the former Procter 
Gamble Co. (PG) director indicted last year for insider trading,
illegally tipped now-convicted hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam
about PG&#8217;s 2008 sale of Folgers Coffee Co. to J.M. Smucker Co. (SJM),
federal prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J.M. Smucker, the Orrville, Ohio-based maker of jams and
other food products, bought Folgers for about $3 billion in June
2008. Prosecutors told U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in
Manhattan yesterday at a pre-trial hearing that the government
may file a superseding indictment against Gupta, also a former
director of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), by the end of the month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also yesterday, Rakoff said Gupta should &#8220;not be too
optimistic&#8221; about his request to bar Rajaratnam&#8217;s wiretapped
calls as evidence in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta&#8217;s lawyer, Gary Naftalis, asked Rakoff to direct
prosecutors to provide more specific details about their case
against his client. Naftalis described as &#8220;vague&#8221; the
indictment filed in October which alleges Gupta passed tips
about Cincinnati-based Procter  Gamble, Goldman Sachs, and
other &#8220;companies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In June 2008, Procter  Gamble sold its Folgers Coffee
business to J.M. Smucker,&#8221; Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard
Tarlowe told Rakoff in court yesterday. &#8220;The allegation is that
Mr. Gupta disclosed the information about that before it was
public to Mr. Rajaratnam.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked by Naftalis to identify any other co-
conspirators in the case against Gupta or sources of illegal
tips, prosecutors said Gupta was the sole source of inside
information for any trading done by Rajaratnam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have no evidence whatsoever that anyone other than Mr.
Gupta tipped Mr. Rajaratnam,&#8221; Assistant U.S. Attorney Reed
Brodsky said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. will probably argue at the April 9 trial that
Rajaratnam told another person that Gupta gave him illegal tips,
defense lawyers said in a Jan. 3 filing. Gupta contends that
prosecutors are trying to make Rajaratnam a government witness
by using statements he made about his alleged sources of inside
information. Defense lawyers note that prosecutors at the same
time have challenged Rajaratnam&#8217;s veracity, and even called the
Galleon Group LLC co-founder a liar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta&#8217;s lawyers said they may argue that the government
can&#8217;t claim that Rajaratnam, convicted of directing the biggest
insider-trading scheme in a generation, is believable on
statements identifying Gupta as his source for illegal tips when
prosecutors have cast doubt on his truthfulness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta, 63, who also led McKinsey  Co., was indicted in
October on accusations that he passed inside information to
Rajaratnam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was charged with five counts of securities fraud and one
count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud. If convicted, he
faces as many as 20 years in prison on each of the securities
fraud counts and as long as five years on the conspiracy charge.
He denies wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, 54, who was convicted by a jury last year, is
serving an 11-year prison term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney
in Manhattan; Jim Margolin, the Federal Bureau of Investigation
spokesman; and Naftalis declined to comment on Gupta&#8217;s court
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are U.S. v. Gupta, 11-cr-00907, and SEC v. Gupta,
11-cv-07566, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lehman Seeks Option to Buy All of Archstone Company &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. told a judge it wants the
right to buy all of a 53 percent stake in Archstone held by Bank
of America Corp. (BAC) and Barclays Plc (BARC) for $2.6 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bankrupt Lehman, which has said it plans to sell Archstone
for $6 billion to help pay creditors, first seeks to gain
control by buying the banks&#8217; stake. Sam Zell&#8217;s Equity
Residential (EQR), Archstone&#8217;s rival in the apartment business, holds
an option to buy half of the banks&#8217; stake in the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the option, &#8220;EQR got the cheapest seat at the
table that it could,&#8221; Paul DeFilippo, a lawyer for Lehman, said
at a court hearing yesterday before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck in Manhattan. &#8220;It could exert leverage to buy 100 percent
of Archstone.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archstone is the largest real-estate asset of Lehman, which
is embarking on a $65 billion liquidation plan after three years
in bankruptcy court. After agreeing to pay the banks $1.3
billion for 26.5 percent of Archstone, Lehman is asking Peck to
rule that it has the right to take Zell&#8217;s option to the rest of
the banks&#8217; stake at the same price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Frank, a lawyer for London-based Barclays, told Peck
that the banks have a right to sell their Archstone stakes at a
market price. If Zell values the second piece of their holding
at more money, Lehman should match his offer, Frank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Frank, Lehman executives told directors at a
Dec. 8 board meeting that they expected to pay about $1.4
billion for the second half of the banks&#8217; stake, not $1.3
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That was before Lehman sued us,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman sued the banks on Dec. 15 for breach of contract,
saying they colluded to sell a stake to Zell&#8217;s company,
Archstone&#8217;s &#8220;largest competitor.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Lehman doesn&#8217;t like Equity Residential,&#8221; Frank said.
&#8220;If they want to keep the elephant out of the tent they can.
They just have to pony up.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ), 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). The complaint is Archstone LB Syndication Partner
LLC v. Banc of America Strategic Venture Inc. (In re Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.), 11-02928, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alabama Sheriff Can&#8217;t Halt Lawsuits, Bankruptcy Judge Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sheriff of Jefferson County, Alabama, and his deputies
can&#8217;t temporarily avoid lawsuits as a result of the county&#8217;s
bankruptcy, a judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Thomas B. Bennett said civil rights
and other suits against Sheriff Mike Hale may proceed so long as
the plaintiffs understand they won&#8217;t collect any money from the
county while it&#8217;s in bankruptcy. The sheriff&#8217;s department is
funded by the county, which may be forced to pay the sheriff&#8217;s
legal bills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plaintiffs who win a judgment against the sheriff will have
to return to court for a separate ruling after the bankruptcy is
over to collect any money from the county, Bennett said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Why would you want to go forward if you have to come back
and re-litigate?&#8221; Bennett asked lawyers for a group of people
suing the sheriff&#8217;s department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferson County filed for bankruptcy last year after the
county, state officials and bondholders failed to implement a
tentative agreement that would have cut debt by about $1
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hale asked Bennett to determine whether the sheriff&#8217;s
department is entitled to the so-called automatic stay of
lawsuits granted the county when it filed bankruptcy in
November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Jefferson County, 11-05736-9, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Alabama (Birmingham). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WikiLeaks Backers Lose Bid to Keep Twitter Data From U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three WikiLeaks backers lost their bid to keep information
on them collected from their Twitter Inc. accounts from being
turned over to U.S. prosecutors who are investigating the
group&#8217;s publication of classified information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Liam O&#8217;Grady in Alexandria, Virginia,
denied Jan. 4 a request by the backers that the information
sought by prosecutors be blocked while a federal appeals court
considers their challenge. O&#8217;Grady, in his ruling, said the
appeal has little chance of success because existing case law
&#8220;overwhelmingly&#8221; supports the government&#8217;s position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Litigation of these issues has already denied the
government lawful access to potential evidence for more than a
year,&#8221; O&#8217;Grady said in his ruling. &#8220;The public interest
therefore weighs strongly against further delay.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The litigation over the Twitter data was the first public
skirmish in the government&#8217;s criminal investigation of
WikiLeaks&#8217;s leader, Julian Assange, and others who may have
helped leak diplomatic cables and classified military documents
through the WikiLeaks website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subscribers challenging the order include Birgitta
Jonsdottir, a member of the Icelandic parliament; Jacob
Appelbaum, a computer security researcher who represented
WikiLeaks at a 2010 hacker&#8217;s conference in New York; and Rop
Gonggrijp, described in court papers as a Dutch activist and
businessman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three subscribers argued that the U.S. subpoena to
Twitter violated their privacy and their rights under the First
Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re obviously disappointed by this ruling and we think
the judge got it wrong,&#8221; said Aden Fine, a lawyer with the
American Civil Liberties Union who represents Jonsdottir. Fine
said his client is considering her options, which include asking
the appeals court to delay turning over the data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They filed an appeal with the U.S. Appeals Court in
Richmond, Virginia, last month after O&#8217;Grady upheld a magistrate
judge&#8217;s ruling that required San Francisco-based Twitter to give
investigators data on subscribers &#8220;associated with WikiLeaks,&#8221;
including Assange and Bradley Manning, a U.S. soldier charged
with leaking classified information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Carr, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride,
declined to comment on O&#8217;Grady&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The district court case is In re Application of the U.S.
for an Order Pursuant to 18 USC 2703(d), 11-dm-00003, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Virginia (Alexandria). The
appeal is In re: 2703(d) Application, 11-5151, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (Richmond). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potential Lawsuits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo Faces Scrutiny by Investors on Mortgage Bonds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bondholder group that won an $8.5 billion settlement (BAC) from
Bank of America Corp. on securities backed by soured home loans
may also seek payments from Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), the nation&#8217;s
biggest mortgage lender. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law firm Gibbs  Bruns LLP said in a statement
yesterday it&#8217;s seeking information on pools securing more than
$19 billion of residential mortgage-backed securities issued by
affiliates of Wells Fargo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faulty mortgages and foreclosures (HOMFCLOS) have cost the five
largest U.S. home lenders about $70 billion since the start of
2007 and helped drive Bank of America&#8217;s shares down almost 60
percent in the past 12 months. Gibbs  Bruns said last month it
may also seek reimbursements from JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the
biggest and most profitable U.S. bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our clients continue to seek a comprehensive solution to
the problems of ineligible mortgages in RMBS pools and deficient
servicing of those loans,&#8221; Kathy Patrick, the Houston-based law
firm&#8217;s lead counsel on the case, said in the statement. Mary
Eshet, a spokeswoman for San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, didn&#8217;t
have an immediate comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News Corp. Pushes Voicemail-Hacking Settlements as Trial Nears &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News Corp.&#8217;s (NWSA) British newspaper unit is pursuing settlements
of at least 10 lawsuits by politicians, movie-stars and other
prominent victims of phone hacking before the first civil trial
over the scandal starts next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labour party lawmaker Chris Bryant and celebrity lawyer
Graham Shear, whose phones were hacked to get stories for News
Corp.&#8217;s News of the World tabloid, are close to settling their
claims, according to documents obtained by Bloomberg News. Their
lawsuits were joined with four other &#8220;test cases&#8221; for a three-
week trial scheduled to start Feb. 13 in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some of the criticism of News Corp.&#8217;s conduct to date has
been about their use of confidential settlements in the past to
prevent facts coming into the public domain, so when it comes to
settling any of these test cases, they should tread carefully,&#8221;
said Mark Watts, a data-privacy lawyer at Bristows in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If settlements are reached, about two dozen other backup
cases are available, though several of those are also close to
settling, including suits filed by ex-lawmaker George Galloway
and former U.K. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, according
to the document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial is intended to give guidance on money damages for
70 cases and potentially hundreds of out-of-court settlements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Geoffrey Vos created the test-case procedure in May,
two months before News Corp. closed the 168-year-old News of the
World and dropped its 7.8 billion-pound ($12.1 billion) bid for
full control of British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY) to contain
public outrage over the five-year-old scandal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re trying to avoid the judge making awards that will
set a dangerous precedent for further claims,&#8221; said Niri Shan,
a media lawyer with Taylor Wessing LLP in London. &#8220;They&#8217;re
buying off the risk of that, and it&#8217;s not unheard of for cases
to settle at the last minute -- even at the door of the court.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daisy Dunlop, a spokeswoman for News International,
declined to comment on the settlement talks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tamsin Allen, the lawyer for Bryant and Prescott, confirmed
that settlement talks are under way. Shear, the celebrity
lawyer, didn&#8217;t return a call for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bayer Judge Postpones First Yaz Trial to Have Cases Mediated [bn:WBTKR=BAYN:GR]  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bayer AG (BAYN) [], Germany&#8217;s largest drugmaker, won&#8217;t face the first
trial next week over claims its birth-control pills caused blood
clots after a judge appointed a mediator in hopes of settling
the cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge David Herndon in Illinois last week
postponed the Jan. 9 trial of a lawsuit accusing Bayer and some
of its units of misleading women about the health risks of its
Yasmin family of birth-control pills. The case was the first of
more than 10,000 suits over injuries allegedly caused by the
drugs, which include the Yaz contraceptive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, Herndon ordered Bayer and lawyers for women suing
the company to meet with mediator Stephen Saltzburg, a George
Washington University law professor, to explore the possibility
of &#8220;settlements in this litigation,&#8221; the judge said in a Dec.
31 order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While continuing to defend the litigation, the company is
engaged in mediation and settlement discussions,&#8221; Rosemarie
Yancosek, a Bayer spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases filed in federal courts were consolidated before
Herndon in East St. Louis, Illinois, for pretrial information
exchanges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herndon scheduled a series of trials for early this year so
juries could begin weighing claims that Bayer and its units
marketed Yaz and other contraceptives as safer than rivals&#8217;
products while knowing they posed a higher risk of clots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Bayer officials protested that so-called bellwether
trials wouldn&#8217;t provide much guidance on the validity of
plaintiffs&#8217; claims, Herndon called in Saltzburg as a mediator,
Michael Papantonio, a Pensacola, Florida-based lawyer for women
suing Bayer, said earlier this week. He was slated to be one of
the lead lawyers for Kerry Sims, whose case was scheduled to
begin Jan. 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Bayer didn&#8217;t want to go to trial and the judge decided to
see whether they wanted to seek a solution outside the
courtroom,&#8221; Papantonio said. &#8220;He&#8217;s giving both sides a chance
to be creative.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Yasmin and Yaz (Drospirenone) Marketing,
Sales Practices and Product Liability Litigation, 09-md-02100,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of Illinois (East St.
Louis). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SK Chairman Chey Indicted by South Korean Prosecutors &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chey Tae Won, the chairman of South Korea&#8217;s third-largest
industrial group, was indicted on charges that he embezzled
funds from SK Holdings Co. (003600) affiliates to cover investment losses
by him and his younger brother. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seoul prosecutors, who held a televised briefing on Chey&#8217;s
indictment yesterday, didn&#8217;t detain the 51-year-old. The
chairman hasn&#8217;t used any company money inappropriately and will
prove his innocence in court, SK said in an e-mailed response to
questions from Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SK Holdings has businesses including oil exploration and
refining, chemicals, telecommunications and transportation. The
indictment came on the same day that SK group (SKGZ) companies said
they would more than double investment to 19 trillion won ($16.5
billion) this year from 2011 and hire 7,000 more workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation may have a &#8220;psychological&#8221; impact on SK
companies while it shouldn&#8217;t affect the day-to-day running of
individual businesses, said Lee Jin Woo, a fund manager at
Seoul-based KTB Asset Management Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chey, who in 2008 was pardoned by President Lee Myung Bak
of a fraud conviction, pledged to keep his businesses unaffected
by the current investigation, SK said in a statement on Dec. 23. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JJ Said to Agree to Pay $1 Billion in Risperdal Marketing Probe &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) will pay more than $1 billion to the U.S.
and most states to resolve a civil investigation into marketing
of the antipsychotic Risperdal, according to people familiar
with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JJ, the world&#8217;s largest health products company, reached
an agreement last week with the U.S. attorney in Philadelphia,
according to the people, who weren&#8217;t authorized to speak about
the matter. Negotiations over a possible criminal plea are still
under way, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government has been investigating Risperdal sales
practices since 2004, including allegations the company marketed
the drug for unapproved uses, JJ has said in Securities and
Exchange Commission filings (JNJ). The company said it has been in
negotiations with the U.S. to settle the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JJ, based in New Brunswick, New Jersey, disclosed in
August that it reached an agreement to settle a misdemeanor
criminal charge related to Risperdal marketing. The company is
discussing paying about $400 million more to settle that portion
of the investigation, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re not going to comment on rumor or speculation,&#8221;
Teresa Mueller, a JJ spokeswoman, said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration approved Risperdal in 1993
for psychotic disorders including schizophrenia. That market is
limited, and JJ&#8217;s Janssen unit sought to sell Risperdal for
bipolar disorder, dementia, mood and anxiety disorders and other
unapproved uses, according to documents in a lawsuit against JJ
by the state of Louisiana. It was later approved for other uses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actavis Will Pay $118.6 Million to End Drug-Pricing Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Units of Actavis Group Hf (ACT) agreed to pay $118.6 million to
resolve claims that they caused the U.S. and four state
governments to overpay for drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement, filed Dec. 29 in federal court in Boston,
followed an $84 million accord announced a day earlier in a
lawsuit by the state of Texas (STOTX1), bringing the total to $202.6
million. In February, a state court jury in Austin ordered units
of the Iceland-based company to pay $170 million for inflating
billings to the Texas Medicaid program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the larger accord, Actavis settled with the U.S., New
York, Florida, South Carolina and Iowa. The U.S., Florida and
Texas cases were filed by Ven-A-Care of the Florida Keys Inc., a
specialty pharmacy which prosecuted them civilly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ven-A-Care sued under the U.S. False Claims Act and similar
statutes in Florida and Texas, which lets whistle-blowers sue on
behalf of the government and share in any recovery. The states
pursued their cases separately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gerard Farrell, a spokesman for Actavis Inc., the U.S. unit
based in Morristown, New Jersey, had no immediate comment on the
settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ven-A-Care settled more than 20 lawsuits since 2000 that
allowed state and federal governments to collect about $3
billion. Ven-A-Care collected more than $400 million in whistle-
blower fees during that period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ven-A-Care is pleased to have resolved all of its matters
with the Actavis group of companies,&#8221; said its attorney, James
Breen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ven-A-Care claimed that Actavis defrauded the U.S. and
state governments by falsely reporting inflated prices of drugs.
Actavis knew that the governments would use those false reports
to set higher reimbursement rates for Medicaid, Ven-A-Care
claimed. Actavis denied wrongdoing in the settlements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department didn&#8217;t join the case, although it
recovered $108 million. Between the two cases, Ven-A-Care
collected $15.6 million, court records show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The U.S. declined to intervene, which means the Justice
Department didn&#8217;t invest any resources in the case,&#8221; Breen
said. &#8220;Ven-A-Care and its legal team funded and pursued the
case, took all the risks, and will return over $108 million to
the federal government. That&#8217;s exactly the way the False Claims
Act is supposed to work.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Pharmaceutical Average Wholesale Price
Litigation, MDL No. 1456, U.S. District Court, District of
Massachusetts (Boston). The Texas case is State of Texas Ex.
Rel. Ven-A-Care of the Florida Keys Inc., D-1-GV-08-1566, Texas
District Court, Travis County (Austin). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Walters Plc (RWA), a U.K.-based
international recruiting company, plans to boost hiring in China
and Indonesia as growth in profit in Asia outpaces the company&#8217;s
U.K. home market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is &#8220;huge potential&#8221; in markets including Bangkok
and Kuala Lumpur, where the company plans to focus on increasing
productivity, Chief Executive Robert Walters said in a phone
interview in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asia Pacific accounted for almost half the company&#8217;s gross
profit of 46.4 million pounds ($72 million) last year, the
London-based company said today in a Regulatory News Service
statement. Profit climbed 16 percent in the Asia Pacific region,
24 percent in Europe, 18 percent in the Americas and South
Africa, and 3 percent in the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Walters recently opened an office in Taipei, Taiwan,
and is handling &#8220;business as usual&#8221; in Australia, the
company&#8217;s biggest market, the executive said. The company has no
plans to hire in the U.K. or France, because of &#8220;weak client
confidence,&#8221; and may reduce staffing in other markets, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be tough,&#8221; Walters added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Walters shares rose as much as 3.1 percent and
traded up 1.1 percent at 164.75 pence at 10:32 a.m. in London. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A disposal of Verizon Communications
Inc. (VZ)&#8217;s fixed-line operations would clear the way for the company
to merge its wireless and enterprise units with partner Vodafone
Group Plc (VOD), analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An agreement on a frequency purchase and marketing
cooperation that Verizon&#8217;s mobile-phone unit reached in December
with U.S. cable operators led by Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) would make
separating its divisions easier, the analysts, including Tim Boddy in London, wrote in a research report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The remaining wireless and enterprise businesses would
have faster growth and a clear fit with Vodafone&#8217;s assets and
strategy, making it a more attractive merger partner,&#8221; the
analysts said in the report yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vodafone, which is based in Newbury, England, owns 45
percent of New York-based Verizon&#8217;s wireless business, the
U.S.&#8217;s largest mobile-phone operator. The companies are
tightening a partnership after Verizon agreed last year to the
first payout from the joint venture since 2005, providing the
U.K. operator with a one-time dividend of 2.8 billion pounds
($4.34 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies will focus on joint purchasing and service
agreements for their business customers in the short term, the
Goldman Sachs analysts said. Verizon Chief Financial Officer
Fran Shammo said in November that the two carriers were moving
from a financial partnership to a strategic relationship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Thonis, a spokesman for Verizon Communications,
didn&#8217;t immediately return calls seeking comment outside business
hours. Simon Gordon, a spokesman for Vodafone, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock Rises &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vodafone rose (VOD) as much as 2.1 percent to 181.1 pence and was
up 1.9 percent at 10:50 a.m. in London. The stock has gained 2.9
percent in the past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the alliance reached with with cable operators,
Basking Ridge, New Jersey-based Verizon Wireless and the
companies agreed to market and sell each other&#8217;s services, and
Verizon Wireless also bought mobile-phone frequencies for $3.6
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon will offer cable-TV products in its retail stores
and receive a percentage of revenue for every cable customer it
signs up, while the cable companies will receive fees for each
wireless customer they attract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department is investigating the deal over
concerns it may reduce competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No More &#8216;Threat&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given that it no longer faces the threat of integrated
cable competitors, Verizon could potentially spin off its
remaining Consumer Wireline assets,&#8221; along with &#8220;large&#8221;
pension and benefit liabilities, the Goldman analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vodafone may generate a total return of 55 percent over the
next two years, with 38 percent coming from a share-price
increase and 17 percent from dividends, Goldman Sachs said. At
the same time, free cash flow may rise to more than 10 billion
pounds for the 2014 fiscal year from 7 billion pounds for the
2012 period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vodafone&#8217;s stock generated a return of 10 percent (BETELES) last
year, making it the third-best performer in the 21-company
Bloomberg Europe 500 Telecom Services Index. Shares including
Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE), Royal KPN NV (KPN) and Telefonica SA (TEF) recorded
losses in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Cazenove analysts cut their
earnings outlook for investment banks for 2011, 2012 and 2013,
citing worsening conditions in fixed income and equities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS AG (UBSN) had its 2011 earnings-per-share estimate trimmed by
4 percent and the 2012 estimate by 11 percent, JPMorgan analysts
including Kian Abouhossein said in a note to clients today.
JPMorgan also curbed its Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) forecast for
2011 by 37 percent and the 2012 figure by 19 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earnings downgrades of banks including Goldman and UBS
&#8220;reflect weaker investment banking client activity and lower
volumes across the board than previously anticipated,&#8221;
JPMorgan&#8217;s analysts said. &#8220;Consensus needs to come down to
reflect the weaker-than-expected environment&#8221; in 2011&#8217;s fourth
quarter, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also cut forecasts for other banks including
Morgan Stanley (MS), whose estimates were reduced by 5 percent for
2011 and 17 percent for 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the largest
publicly traded oil company, settled its lawsuit against U.S.
Interior Secretary Kenneth Salazar over the government&#8217;s
decision to cancel offshore leases that may yield &#8220;billions of
barrels of oil.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accord &#8220;will allow ExxonMobil to develop this very
large, but technically challenging, resource as quickly as
possible using a phased approach,&#8221; Patrick McGinn, a spokesman
for Irving, Texas-based Exxon, said in an e-mail yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon sued Aug. 12 over a ruling by the department that
canceled Gulf of Mexico leases for the so-called Julia Unit. The
company and the government entered into settlement agreement on
Dec. 30, according to a filing yesterday in U.S. District Court
in Lake Charles, Louisiana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon said in its complaint that it sought a suspension for
its Julia leases in 2008 because of drilling complexity. It
cited federal regulations that allow oil oil producers to
suspend production in their fields, partly &#8220;to facilitate
proper development of a lease.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Interior Department denied the request in 2009, stating
that the company&#8220;had not demonstrated a commitment to
production&#8221; according to court papers. Unsuccessful appeals
followed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suspension of Production &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the settlement, the Interior Department granted
a suspension of production for the leases from Dec. 13, 2008, to
Oct. 31, 2013. The department will grant a second suspension
until Aug. 31, 2014, if Exxon and Statoil ASA (STL), a partner in
Exxon&#8217;s Julia fields, remains in compliance with the terms of
the agreement and takes certain steps toward production,
according to court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon and Statoil agreed to pay a yearly fee on the
original leases of $650 per acre until 87.5 million barrels of
oil are produced from the fields. The first fee will be owed for
2011, according to court documents. The minimum royalty rate for
the leases was increased to $11 per acre and the yearly rental
rate increased to $16 an acre. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Julia project will play an important role in meeting
America&#8217;s energy demand,&#8221; McGinn said in the e-mail. &#8220;The
initial phase of the project is expected to produce more than
175 million barrels of oil through six production wells.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melissa Schwartz, a spokeswoman for the Interior
Department, said in an e-mailed statement that the proposed
settlement affirms the regulatory process, &#8220;provides incentives
for timely and thorough development of the leases, and secures a
fair return on those resources to the U.S. Treasury.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Kenneth Salazar, 11-
CV-1474, U.S. District Court, Western District of Louisiana
(Lake Charles). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Target Corp. (TGT) raised $2.5 billion in
bonds, its biggest debt offering since January 2008, as the
second-largest U.S. discount retailer seeks to pay back
obligations tied to its credit-card business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company sold $1.5 billion of one-year floating-rate
debt and $1 billion of 2.9 percent, 10-year fixed-rate bonds to
buy a note issued by a Target Card Owner Trust to JPMorgan Chase
 Co., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Minneapolis-
based Target is able to prepay principal on the note until Jan.
31, it said in its most recent quarterly filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Target, which sold almost half of its credit-card loans to
JPMorgan for $3.6 billion in 2008, said in November it plans to
make an announcement regarding the sale of receivables before
Chief Financial Officer Doug Scovanner retires at the end of
March. The company said last year that the performance of the
portfolio and capital market conditions made an attractive
opportunity to sell the receivables. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The most likely form of such an announcement will be that
we&#8217;ve reached an agreement with a buyer on both the terms of
such a sale and on the nature of an ongoing arrangement with
them as well,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer Gregg Steinhafel said on
a conference call to discuss earnings in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale was Target&#8217;s biggest since the company conducted a
$4 billion offering in January 2008, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Target&#8217;s Bond Spread &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10-year notes pay 102 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. That compares with an
80 basis-point spread Target paid on $1 billion of similar-
maturity debt in July 2010, the data show. The floating-rate
notes pay 3 basis points above the three-month London interbank
offered rate, a lending benchmark (US0003M) set at 0.58 percent today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Ackman, founder of New York-based Pershing Square
Capital Management LP, lost a boardroom battle more than two
years ago in which he pushed Target to divest the card unit and
separate its land holdings into a real estate investment trust.
Excising credit cards would have stemmed the risk of rising non-
payments by consumers during the worst economic crisis since the
Great Depression, the hedge fund manager said. Target now favors
a sale to fund store expansion in Canada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Target last tapped the debt market in July, issuing $1
billion of three-year notes, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;France Telecom SA (FTE), the country&#8217;s largest phone company,
sold $900 million of 30-year bonds at a 240 basis point spread
today, Bloomberg data show. Auto and home insurer Allstate
Corp. (ALL), based in Northbrook, Illinois, sold $500 million of 5.2
percent, 30-year bonds to pay back notes that mature next month
and to buy back stock, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy Transfer Partners LP and Toyota Motor Credit Corp.
are both marketing $2 billion bond offerings today, according to
people with knowledge of the offerings, who declined to be
identified because terms aren&#8217;t set. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MetLife Inc. (MET) was upgraded to &#8220;buy&#8221;
at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) as the largest U.S. life insurer
weighs scaling back or exiting businesses to meet targets for
shareholder returns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher Giovanni, an equity analyst at Goldman Sachs,
cited the insurer&#8217;s business review and goal of reducing
variable annuity sales in a report today. He previously had a
&#8220;neutral&#8221; rating (MET) on the New York-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MetLife Chief Executive Officer Steven Kandarian, 59, has
said &#8220;everything is on the table&#8221; as he retools the insurer
after the $16 billion acquisition of American Life Insurance Co.
in 2010, which added to international operations. The firm
announced a deal with General Electric Co.&#8217;s finance unit last
month to divest most of the deposits at MetLife Bank as the
insurer seeks to limit regulation by the Federal Reserve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MetLife&#8217;s push to reduce sales of variable annuities, the
equity-linked retirement products, may &#8220;be followed by further
initiatives to increase focus on its higher returning global
initiative and return of capital when it (finally) abandons Fed
oversight,&#8221; Giovanni said in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MetLife said in October that the Fed had rejected its
proposal to raise its dividend and resume share buybacks. The
insurer is subject to the oversight because of its size and
ownership of the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MetLife rose 1.1 percent to $33.26 at 4 p.m. in New York.
The insurer has slid 28 percent in the last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, sued Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. (MMI) in London&#8217;s
High Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Court papers didn&#8217;t give details on the content of
Microsoft&#8217;s claim against Motorola Mobility, which is being
acquired by Google Inc. (GOOG), maker of the Android operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit was filed Dec. 23, three days after Microsoft won
a ruling before the U.S. International Trade Commission over
claims Android-based smartphones infringe Microsoft&#8217;s patents,
and two weeks after a hearing in Germany over similar claims
alleged by Microsoft against Motorola Mobility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ITC, which issued two findings on the matter last
month, said some features of Android phones use licensed
technology without permission, rulings which fell short of
Microsoft&#8217;s original broader claims that its inventions are
widely used in Android phones. Motorola Mobility General Counsel
Scott Offer said at the time that the majority of that ruling is
favorable to the handset maker and may provide clarity on what
Microsoft owns to avoid potential infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lacretia Taylor, a spokeswoman for Redmond, Washington-
based Microsoft, didn&#8217;t have an immediate comment on the U.K.
lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gemma Priscott and Jennifer Erickson, spokeswomen for
Motorola Mobility, didn&#8217;t immediately return calls for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google said Aug. 15 it would buy Libertyville, Illinois-
based Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion to obtain patents that
may be used to fend off suits targeting handsets and tablet
computers that use Android. Microsoft makes its own mobile-
operating system, Windows Phone 7, which competes with Android. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is: Microsoft Corporation v. Motorola Mobility
Inc., case no. HC11C04536, High Court of London, Chancery
Division (London). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is staying
&#8220;overweight&#8221; on commodities as a rebound in demand revives
speculation of shortages, with gold a favorite for 2012 as
investors seek a hedge against Europe&#8217;s debt crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold futures traded on the Comex in New York may climb to
$1,940 an ounce in 12 months as U.S. interest rates and
inflation are expected to remain low, Jeffrey Currie, head of
commodities research, said at the company&#8217;s Strategy Conference
2012 in London today, repeating the bank&#8217;s December forecast.
Gold has dropped 16 percent from a record in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand for gold strengthened most of last year as
Europe&#8217;s debt crisis widened and the U.S. Federal Reserve
pledged to keep interest rates near zero until at least mid-
2013. Low interest rates increase the appeal of bullion because
they generally reduce the prospect of returns on bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our view on gold is driven by our view on underlying real
interest rates,&#8221; Currie said in an interview at the conference.
&#8220;It is the sharp drop in price that makes it more attractive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold futures for March delivery were unchanged at $1,616.80
an ounce at 5:11 p.m. in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley also named gold among its top picks in a
report e-mailed today, saying bullion may average a record
$2,200 an ounce. Gold prices are unlikely to move higher than
$1,940 unless there is a &#8220;much weaker real rate environment&#8221;
driven by inflation, which is not embedded in Goldman&#8217;s
forecast, Currie said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central Banks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying by central banks (001.046) will continue to support gold as
emerging markets banks continue to diversify their reserves,
Currie told the conference. Goldman also favors oil and copper
on supply constraints, Currie said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The core of the commodities story is a supply-side
story,&#8221; Currie said today. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care how much demand China
may have for a commodity. If the world can produce enough of it,
I don&#8217;t want to be long.&#8221; A long position is a bet on higher
prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman correctly advised investors to sell oil and copper
in April and turned more bullish the next month before prices
rebounded. The Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index
will return 15 percent in 12 months, Currie said &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Maria Kolesnikova" date="Jan 09, 2012 12:35 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-09/goldman-says-u-s-banks-may-boost-commodity-loans-on-europe-woes.html"><headline>Goldman Says U.S. Banks May Boost Commodity Loans on Europe Woes</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said U.S.
and Asian lenders will boost their share of commodity trade
financing as European banks curb loans, making disruptions in
the markets unlikely while traders&#8217; borrowing costs may rise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Currie, head of commodities research, commented
today in an interview in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Thus far there is not much evidence of significant market
disruptions due to a lack of trade credits in Asia and America.
The core of disruptions seems to be within the European Union.
The overall stock of trade credits is unlikely to change
significantly, only the ownership, as European banks exit these
businesses and sell them to the U.S. or Asian buyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;Ultimately, after the transfers are completed, the
lasting impact is that it will likely cost more for commodity
operators to access this type of funding.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the impact of trade finance difficulties on different
markets: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;Commodities are being impacted equally by the trade
finance problems, but the price reactions have been different.
This is because size of the impact relative to the market is
different and the underlying fundamental stories are different. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;Oil has much tighter inventories and is a much larger
global market, so it&#8217;s not reacting to the same degree as the
smaller markets. Other markets, say copper or aluminum, were
much harder hit because they are smaller markets, more exposed
to Europe and they have higher inventory levels from which de-
stocking could occur.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Benjamin Harvey and Selcuk Gokoluk" date="Jan 09, 2012 10:12 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-09/turkey-s-lira-headed-for-one-month-high-as-jpmorgan-prefers-it-over-rand.html"><headline>Lira Heads for 1-Month High on Central Bank Dollar Sales, JPMorgan Praise</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The lira climbed to its highest level
in a month as the central bank sold dollars and JPMorgan Chase
 Co. said it favored Turkey&#8217;s currency over the South African
rand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turkish currency appreciated 0.5 percent to 1.8696 per
dollar at 2:54 p.m. in Istanbul, rising for a second day and
heading for the highest level since Dec. 9. The lira has gained
1.1 percent this year, making it the best-performing among
emerging-market currencies in Europe, the Middle East and
Africa, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lira weakened the most among emerging-market currencies
last year, down 18 percent, as inflation ended last year at
10.5% which was twice the central bank&#8217;s target. The bank has
spent $15 billion to prop up the lira since August. It refrained
from providing funds to banks today at its lower 5.75 percent
one-week repo funding rate, signaling continuation of tight
monetary policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The central bank&#8217;s backstop for the lira is stronger than
ever while official policy support for the rand remains weak,&#8217;
JPMorgan said in a weekly report on emerging markets published
Jan. 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy the lira at 4.33 rand per lira (TRYZAR) and
exit after the exchange rate rises 6.3 percent to 4.60,
according to JPMorgan. The central bank sold $150 million today
in two additional auctions of $50m each under a policy announced
Dec. 6 and a regular sale of $50m. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the lira price action becomes unfavorable, the
investment bank suggested investors abandon th trade at 4.15.
The lira weakened 0.2 percent against the rand to 4.3599, down
for a fifth day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on two-year Turkish debt dropped 19 basis points, or
0.19 percentage point, to 11.27 percent, in its biggest decline
since Dec. 29, a Turk Ekonomi Bankasi index of the securities
showed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Olympus Corp. (7733), the camera maker that
admitted hiding losses for over a decade, said it&#8217;s considering
suing present and past executives after receiving a report from
a panel probing management responsibility for the cover-up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will announce its response to the panel&#8217;s
report tomorrow, it said in a statement to the Tokyo Stock
Exchange yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olympus should seek damages of more than 90 billion yen
($1.2 billion) from more than 10 current and past executives,
including President Shuichi Takayama, for covering up massive
losses, according to the panel&#8217;s report, Kyodo reported
yesterday. Former Chief Executive Officer Michael Woodford, who
was fired after he questioned $1.5 billion in takeover costs, is
suing the company over his dismissal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company inflated fees to advisers on the 2008
acquisition of Gyrus Group Plc and overpaid in purchasing three
Japanese companies with the intention of increasing goodwill, a
separate independent panel investigating the fraud said last
month. The panel said it found a culture of &#8220;yes men&#8221; and a
board that failed in its duty to stop a &#8220;rotten&#8221; core of
executives from duping auditors, regulators and investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tokyo-based Olympus admitted in November that former
Chairman Tsuyoshi Kikukawa, Hisashi Mori, who was fired as
executive vice president, and Hideo Yamada, a former company
auditor, colluded to hide losses on securities investments in
the 1990s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has lost (7733) about $5 billion of market
capitalization since firing Woodford and was forced to restate
more than five years of earnings last month to avoid an
automatic delisting from the Tokyo Stock Exchange after
admitting to a 13-year cover-up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olympus declined to comment on the report, Yoshiaki Yamada,
a spokesman for the company, said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woodford filed a case in the U.K. last week seeking damages
for the remainder of his four-year contract and additional
costs. The British national said last week he may also file a
case in Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woodford, 51, also abandoned efforts to regain control of
Olympus after failing to gain support from Japanese
shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ENRC Sues Former Executive in Dispute Over &#8216;Dishonest&#8217; Raise &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. (ENRC), the producer of metals in
Kazakhstan, sued its former head of human resources Andrew
Balgarnie, accusing the ex-Morgan Stanley banker of dishonestly
giving himself a 100,000 pound ($154,500) raise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ENRC filed the counterclaim against Balgarnie last month,
according to court documents. The move follows Balgarnie&#8217;s
decision to sue ENRC for wrongful dismissal in November,
claiming he is owed 310,000 pounds in back pay and bonuses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balgarnie &#8220;is an individual who appears to operate on the
basis that wrongdoing on the part of a senior executive is
acceptable so long as he can get away with it,&#8221; ENRC said in
court papers filed on Dec. 22. The company said it is seeking
the return of 74,000 pounds which resulted from a pay increase
not properly approved by Chief Executive Officer Felix Vulis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ENRC, which held a three-month review of its corporate
governance last year amid conflicts between the board and
shareholders, agreed Jan. 5 to acquire First Quantum Minerals
Ltd.&#8217;s assets in the Democratic Republic of Congo for $1.25
billion, ending a legal dispute between the companies over the
Kolwezi copper project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The allegations of misconduct and dishonesty as set out
in ENRC&#8217;s counterclaim are vigorously resisted,&#8221; Balgarnie&#8217;s
lawyer James Cox said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vulis resigned in February of last year only to be re-
appointed as CEO seven months later following a management
review that began when shareholders voted against rehiring
independent directors Richard Sykes and Kenneth Olisa in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ENRC&#8217;s three founders, Alexander Machkevitch, Alijan
Ibragimov and Patokh Chodiev, hold 14.6 percent of the company,
which makes ferroalloys, iron ore, aluminum and power in
Kazakhstan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Balgarnie&#8217;s claims are unfounded and ENRC is
vigorously defending its position,&#8221; the company said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News Corp. (NWSA) Phone-Hacking Probe Yields New Arrest, Police Say &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;British police investigating phone-hacking by journalists
at News Corp.&#8217;s now-defunct News of the World tabloid arrested a
47-year-old woman on suspicion of attempting to pervert the
course of justice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman was detained Jan. 6 in Essex, England, the
Metropolitan Police Service said in a statement, without giving
her name. She was then bailed to return to an Essex police
station later this month, the MPS said. The BBC reported the
woman is Cheryl Carter, the ex-personal assistant of Rebekah
Brooks, who was chief executive officer of News Corp.&#8217;s U.K.
publishing unit before she resigned in July and was arrested in
the probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scandal prompted Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s News Corp. to close
the News of the World in July and drop its 7.8 billion-pound
($12.1 billion) bid for full control of British Sky Broadcasting
Group Plc. (BSY) Previous arrests also include former News of the
World editor Andy Coulson, who is free on bail until March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jan. 6 arrest is the 17th in the probe, called
Operation Weeting. Brooks, who has denied wrongdoing, is on bail
until March and hasn&#8217;t been charged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A call to Carter&#8217;s home in Essex wasn&#8217;t answered. A
spokeswoman for News Corp.&#8217;s News International unit in London
said that Carter left the company last year and declined to
comment on whether she was arrested. Carter wrote fashion
articles for News Corp.&#8217;s Sun tabloid in Britain as recently as
October 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brooks&#8217;s spokeswoman Emma Capon didn&#8217;t return a call for
comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEC Alters Settlement Policy in Cases With Criminal Convictions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has modified
its boilerplate settlement language to require that defendants
admit wrongdoing when they have already done so in parallel
criminal proceedings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change doesn&#8217;t affect the SEC&#8217;s typical approach of
settling cases without requiring the subject of the action to
admit wrongdoing when there is no criminal conviction, SEC
Enforcement Director Robert Khuzami said Jan. 6 in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The new policy does not require admissions or
adjudications of fact beyond those already made in criminal
cases, but eliminates language that may be construed as
inconsistent with admissions or findings that have already been
made in criminal cases,&#8221; Khuzami said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC has come under fire for allowing subjects of
lawsuits to settle claims without admitting to the misconduct.
U.S. District Court Judge Jed Rakoff cited that policy last
month when he rejected the agency&#8217;s proposed $285 million
settlement with Citigroup Inc. over claims the bank misled
investors in a financial product linked to risky mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policy change, which has been under consideration for
several months, is &#8220;separate and unrelated to&#8221; Rakoff&#8217;s ruling
in the Citigroup matter and has no impact on cases with no
parallel criminal proceeding, Khuzami said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Henning, a former SEC attorney who is now a law
professor at Wayne State University in Detroit, said &#8220;given the
admission of guilt in the criminal case, it&#8217;s hard to see how
this would have any impact.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung Fails to Win Sales Ban on Apple&#8217;s IPhone 4S in Italy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung Electronics Co. (005930), the maker of the Galaxy mobile
devices, failed to win a sales ban on Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s latest iPhone
in Italy, as a global patent dispute between the two companies
continues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Milan court rejected Dec. 5 the Suwon, South Korea-based
company&#8217;s bid to block the iPhone 4S in Italy, said Nam Ki Yung,
a Seoul-based spokesman for Samsung, confirming an earlier
report by Ansa news agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung, which reported a 73 percent jump in fourth-quarter
operating profit Dec. 6 after selling a record number of
handsets last year, also failed to win a sales ban on the iPhone
4S in France last month. Samsung and Apple have been suing each
other in multiple countries over patents related to mobile
technologies and designs since the iPhone maker accused the
South Korean rival of copying its products last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will review the ruling and consider all available
measures to further protect our intellectual property rights and
stop this free riding on our technology,&#8221; Samsung said in a
statement, referring to the Jan. 5 decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Park, an Apple spokesman in Seoul, reiterated the
company&#8217;s earlier statement on the dispute that Apple needs to
protect its intellectual property against &#8220;blatant copying.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Judge Refuses to Block Zell Option on Archstone &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) lost a bid to block Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) and Barclays Plc (BARC) from giving Sam Zell&#8217;s Equity
Residential (EQR) an option to buy 26.5 percent of Archstone when a
judge said Zell was entitled to the option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman tried to block the deal, saying it would be forced
to pay more than the $2.6 billion it sought to pay for the
banks&#8217; 53 percent stake in Archstone. Lehman may be insolvent,
yet it is &#8220;cash-rich&#8221; and can afford to pay a bit more, U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge James Peck said in a court hearing Jan. 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peck said he assumed the Zell company would bid about $1.4
billion for half of the banks&#8217; stake, because if Lehman matches
his offer, Equity Residential would get a so-called breakup fee
in compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks&#8217; deal with Zell is really &#8220;a disguised sale of
100 percent of the banks&#8217; stake to Lehman,&#8221; designed to get a
good price, he said. &#8220;I know it.&#8221; However, he said, the Zell
company is entitled to the benefit of exercising its option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peck said he agreed with the banks, which had argued that
the fight over Archstone &#8220;is simply about money.&#8221; Lehman
wouldn&#8217;t be harmed if the deal went forward, he said. He said he
sided with the Zell company, which argued it would be harmed if
Lehman blocked the deal because it had spent time and money on
the investment, and would end up with nothing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman, which has said it aims to sell Archstone for $6
billion to help pay creditors, is first seeking to gain control
by buying the banks&#8217; stake. Zell&#8217;s company is Archstone&#8217;s
biggest rival in the apartment business, referred to by Peck as
&#8220;the elephant in the room.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archstone is Lehman&#8217;s biggest real estate asset. It
currently owns 47 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman is embarking on a $65 billion liquidation plan after
three years in bankruptcy court, with cash of more than $20
billion raised so far. After agreeing to pay the banks $1.3
billion for 26.5 percent of Archstone, Lehman asked Peck to rule
that it has the right to take Zell&#8217;s option to the rest of the
banks&#8217; stake at the same price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman sued the banks on Dec. 15 for breach of contract,
saying they colluded to sell a stake to Zell&#8217;s company,
Archstone&#8217;s &#8220;largest competitor.&#8221; As part of the suit it asked
Peck to block the deal with Zell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). The complaint is Archstone LB Syndication Partner
LLC v. Banc of America Strategic Venture Inc. (In re Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.), 11-02928, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, Salazar Reach Accord on Offshore Oil Lease Dispute &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and U.S. Interior Secretary Kenneth
Salazar agreed to settle a lawsuit in which the world&#8217;s largest
publicly traded oil company challenged the government&#8217;s decision
to cancel offshore leases that may yield &#8220;billions of barrels
of oil,&#8221; according to a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accord &#8220;will allow ExxonMobil to develop this very
large, but technically challenging, resource as quickly as
possible using a phased approach,&#8221; Patrick McGinn, a spokesman
for Irving, Texas-based Exxon, said in an e-mail Jan. 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon sued Aug. 12 over a ruling by the department that
canceled Gulf of Mexico leases for the so-called Julia Unit. The
company and the government entered into settlement agreement on
Dec. 30, according to a filing Jan. 6 in U.S. District Court in
Lake Charles, Louisiana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon said in its complaint that it sought a suspension for
its Julia leases in 2008 because of drilling complexity. It
cited federal regulations that allow oil oil producers to
suspend production in their fields, partly &#8220;to facilitate
proper development of a lease.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Interior Department denied the request in 2009, stating
that the company&#8220;had not demonstrated a commitment to
production&#8221; according to court papers. Unsuccessful appeals
followed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the settlement, the Interior Department granted
a suspension of production for the leases from Dec. 13, 2008, to
Oct. 31, 2013. The department will grant a second suspension
until Aug. 31, 2014, if Exxon and Statoil ASA (STL), a partner in
Exxon&#8217;s Julia fields, remains in compliance with the terms of
the agreement and takes certain steps toward production,
according to court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon and Statoil agreed to pay a yearly fee on the
original leases of $650 per acre until 87.5 million barrels of
oil are produced from the fields. The first fee will be owed for
2011, according to court documents. The minimum royalty rate for
the leases was increased to $11 per acre and the yearly rental
rate increased to $16 an acre. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melissa Schwartz, a spokeswoman for the Interior
Department, said in an e-mailed statement that the proposed
settlement affirms the regulatory process, &#8220;provides incentives
for timely and thorough development of the leases, and secures a
fair return on those resources to the U.S. Treasury.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Kenneth Salazar, 11-
CV-1474, U.S. District Court, Western District of Louisiana
(Lake Charles). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s Bid to Block Ecuadorean Asset Collection Denied &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s bid to protect its assets that could be
seized as part of an $18 billion environmental damages verdict
against the company in Ecuador was denied by a U.S. judge, who
said the request could be renewed at a later date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, had asked
U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in New York to block the
collection of the judgment and the &#8220;dissipating&#8221; of any
proceeds pending resolution of the company&#8217;s racketeering
lawsuit alleging that the plaintiffs engaged in fraud to win the
Ecuadorean judgment. The company sought to &#8220;temporarily ensure
the availability&#8221; of all assets while the U.S. case proceeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron has made no effort to quantify the damages it
alleged has been sustained to date, let alone to support any
damage claim with evidence,&#8221; Kaplan said in his ruling Jan. 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron was ordered on Feb. 14 to pay as much as $18
billion in compensatory and punitive damages for Texaco Inc.&#8217;s
alleged dumping of toxic drilling wastes in the Ecuadorean
jungle from 1964 to about 1992. The ruling came in an 18-year-
old lawsuit decided by a judge in Lago Agrio, a provincial
capital near the Colombian border. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Kaplan blocked the collection of the Ecuadorean
judgment in March, a federal appeals panel in September tossed
that ruling. The appeals court hasn&#8217;t issued a full opinion in
the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron denies wrongdoing in the Lago Agrio lawsuit. The
company says Texaco cleaned up its share of the pollution at its
former oil fields, which were taken over by PetroEcuador,
Ecuador&#8217;s state-owned oil company. Chevron says it was released
from any future liability by an agreement between Texaco and
Ecuador. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kent Robertson, a spokesman for Chevron, said in an e-mail
that &#8220;we appreciate the court&#8217;s prompt response to our motion.
The court decided the motion on very narrow grounds and did not
question the strength of Chevron&#8217;s fraud evidence. Clearly the
court has left the door open to a future attachment filing.  We
look forward to the balance of our racketeering case proceeding
and remain committed to holding the plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers
accountable for their misconduct.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karen Hinton, a U.S. spokeswoman for the Ecuadorean
plaintiffs, said in an e-mail that &#8220;it is clear that Chevron&#8217;s
motion had no legal basis and was designed yet again to distract
attention from the company&#8217;s fraudulent misconduct in Ecuador as
well as its obligation to clean up its toxic waste in Ecuador&#8217;s
Amazon that threatens the lives of thousands of people.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The racketeering case is Chevron v. Donziger, 11-00691,
U.S. District Court, District of New York (Manhattan). The case
in Ecuador is Maria Aquinda v. Chevron, 002-2003, Superior Court
of Nueva Loja, Lago Agrio, Ecuador. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Koskie, Siskinds to Lead Class-Action Suit Against Sino-Forest &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koskie Minsky LLP and Siskinds LLP won approval from an
Ontario judge to lead an investor class-action lawsuit against
Sino-Forest Corp. (TRE) and its executives, according to court
documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ontario Superior Court Judge Paul Perell announced the
decision Jan. 6 in a 57-page judgment. Four firms competed to be
the lead counsel in a class action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sino-Forest, a China timber producer, dropped 74 percent in
trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange after Carson Block, a
short seller, said in June the company had overstated its forest
plantation assets. The company, with $1.8 billion in bonds
outstanding, has been suspended from share trading since August
and denies the allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Chandler, a billionaire investor whose investment
company owns 19 percent of Sino-Forest according to data
compiled by Bloomberg, said the timber company needs to change
its chief executive officer and appoint new directors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law firms are seeking damages on behalf of buyers of
Sino-Forest shares and bonds in both the primary and the
secondary markets, said Dimitri Lascaris, a lawyer at Siskinds,
by e-mail Jan. 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firms expect to present a motion for certification of
their class-action suit within three months, said Kirk Baert, a
lawyer at Koskie, in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is trustees of the Labourers&#8217; Pension Fund of
Central and Eastern Canada v. Sino-Forest, 11-CV-431153CP,
Superior Court of Justice (Ontario). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Court Filings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CMBS Holders Alleging &#8216;Brazen Scheme&#8217; Most Popular Docket &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A suit by a group of commercial-mortgage backed securities
investors accusing a junior lender and other parties, of a
&#8220;brazen scheme&#8221; to steal more than $60 million from
bondholders, was the most-read litigation docket on the
Bloomberg Law system last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investors, three collateralized debt obligations and
TCG Holdings I LLC, hold pieces of a $1.26 billion deal sold by
Credit Suisse Group AG in 2007, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
analysts led by Richard Hill wrote in a report Dec. 29. They are
seeking to block Galante Holdings Inc. from purchasing a $150
million loan on the J.W. Marriott Summerlin Hotel, Resort, Spa
and Casino in Las Vegas, according to the court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit names TriMont Real Estate Advisors as the so-
called special servicer. Special servicers, firms that handle
troubled property loans packaged into securities, have the
option to buy defaulted loans provided the value is deemed fair.
The lawsuit claims that Galante, which owns $10 million in
junior debt against the property, &#8220;conspired&#8221; with the
servicer to purchase the debt for less than it&#8217;s worth,
according to the RBS analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Cedarwoods CRE CDO II Ltd. v. Galante Holdings
Inc., 11-653624, New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan (New
York County). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said industrywide
sales of personal computers will probably be lower than analysts
had projected in the fourth quarter because supply was hurt by
flooding in Thailand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts have estimated that total PC shipments fell about
1 percent in the quarter, Tami Reller, chief financial officer
of Microsoft&#8217;s Windows unit, said an investment conference. The
actual number is probably lower, she said. Bill Koefoed,
Microsoft&#8217;s general manager of investor relations, echoed those
remarks at a separate event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As the numbers come out, you&#8217;ll likely see that number
decline further as the impact has been felt faster than people
had anticipated,&#8221; Koefoed said at a JPMorgan Chase  Co.
conference. Reller told the audience at a Nomura Holdings Inc.
event that there could potentially be more downward adjustments.
Both conferences were held in Las Vegas, where the Consumer
Electronics Show is under way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year&#8217;s flooding in Thailand, which knocked disk-drive
factories off line, took a toll on a PC market that was already
suffering from competition with smartphones and Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s
iPad. Microsoft&#8217;s Windows sales have missed estimates in three
of the past four quarters. The comments today probably mean they
will fall short again, said Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at
Pacific Crest Securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Under Siege&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Windows business is under siege,&#8221; said Barnicle, who
had estimated that PC shipments dropped 1 percent in the
quarter. He rates Microsoft shares &#8220;sector perform.&#8221; &#8220;Windows
is their most profitable business. If that&#8217;s not stable for
whatever reason -- Thailand, Apple -- it just becomes difficult
for the stock to gain momentum.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker,
slipped 1.8 percent in extended trading after the comments were
reported. The stock had closed at $27.84 earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is working to release a new operating system,
Windows 8, that&#8217;s designed to work on iPad-like tablets, helping
it compete with Apple. A public test version is set for
February, and Reller gave a preview last night during Chief
Executive Officer Steve Ballmer&#8217;s keynote address at the
Consumer Electronics Show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The executives today declined to comment on when the final
version will go on sale. Analysts expect it later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest computer-chip maker, cut
its fourth-quarter revenue forecast by $1 billion last month,
citing the disk-drive shortages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While drive manufactures are still working to recover, some
have bounced back faster than they had expected. Western Digital
Corp. (WDC), one of the harder-hit companies, has resumed production
and raised its quarterly revenue forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, these types of shortages take time to go away,
Microsoft&#8217;s Reller said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It tends to take a few quarters to work its way through
the system,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It would be naive to believe
otherwise.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said personal

&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Drew Armstrong and Robert Langreth" date="Jan 10, 2012  4:12 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-10/pfizer-s-read-says-animal-nutritional-decisions-on-track-.html"><headline>Pfizer&#8217;s Read Says Animal, Nutritional Decisions &#8216;On Track&#8217;</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chief Executive Officer
Ian Read said the company&#8217;s decision to sell or spin off its
animal and nutritional health units hasn&#8217;t reached a conclusion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is on track and we are happy with the way it is
going,&#8221; Read said today during an interview at the J.P. Morgan
Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. He also said he had no
plans for a large acquisition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestle SA (NESN), Danone, Abbott Laboratories and Heinz (HNZ) are among
potential buyers with nutrition lines of their own. Heinz has an
existing infant food business and no formula line, said Lee
Linthicum, an analyst with Euromonitor International. New York-
based Pfizer&#8217;s infant formula lines are also strong in the Asian
and Middle Eastern markets, where Danone (BN) and Nestle are weaker,
Linthicum said in a telephone interview last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The divestitures are part of Read&#8217;s plan to slim the
world&#8217;s largest drugmaker and focus on new medicines in the wake
of top-selling cholesterol pill Lipitor facing generic
competition last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those plans don&#8217;t include another &#8220;mega&#8221; merger, Read
said. &#8220;I&#8217;m very disinclined to be looking at any possibility of
a mega acquisition,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You never say never, but we
have all the science we need and we have the geographic
breadth.&#8221; Instead, the company will look at mid-size &#8220;bolt-
on&#8221; deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer didn&#8217;t make any such purchases in 2011, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The largest was a $49.8 million
purchase of the company&#8217;s remaining stake in Icagen Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Share Repurchases &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, the company authorized a $10 billion share
repurchase program. Read said the stock is undervalued, though
share buybacks &#8220;are not a growth strategy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has been fighting to hang on to sales of Lipitor (PHAM1150)
during the 180-day period in which only Ranbaxy Laboratories
Ltd. (RBXY) and Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI) can sell the copycat
versions. In the last week of 2011, it had 41 percent of the
market for the drug, according to a report by Bloomberg
Industries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is playing out how we expected,&#8221; Read said. The
company has made agreements with insurers to block sales of the
generics in return for rebates from Pfizer. The company has also
distributed cards to patients that offer a discounted copayment
at the pharmacy when they get the brand-name version of Lipitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-Pay Plan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been some hang-ups with the co-pay card plan,
Read said. &#8220;Patients are encountering resistance&#8221; when they go
to pharmacy with the card, he said. &#8220;They have to be
insistent&#8221; to get Pfizer&#8217;s brand-name version, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s nutritionals unit sells prenatal vitamins and
infant formula worldwide. The nutritionals unit had $1.87
billion in 2010 revenue. The company is also divesting its $3.56
billion animal health unit. Both transactions will be announced
this year and completed from July 2012 to July 2013, said Joan Campion, a Pfizer spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer acquired the infant nutrition business as part of
its $68 billion takeover of Wyeth in 2009. Read is shedding the
units as part of his plan to slim down Pfizer and focus on
creating new drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestle, Danone and Abbott (ABT) spoke to financial advisers about
the business, and were likely to bid, people with knowledge of
the process said in July. The people declined to be identified
because the talks are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbott Reaction &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbott, of Abbott Park, Illinois, is separating its
pharmaceuticals business from one that includes medical devices,
nutritional products and generic drugs. Chief Financial Officer
Tom Freyman said today the split wouldn&#8217;t hamper merger and
acquisition efforts if a &#8220;valuable&#8221; prospect arose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If there&#8217;s an opportunity that&#8217;s useful or valuable to
the company, certainly we would pursue it,&#8221; Freyman told
investors today at the JPMorgan (JPM) conference. &#8220;At this time there
isn&#8217;t anything of that nature out there that I&#8217;m in a position
to talk about today.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freyman said he was aware Pfizer&#8217;s looking to divest its
nutritionals unit, and declined to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re happy with our business,&#8221; Freyman said in an
interview today. &#8220;I&#8217;ll leave it at that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer gained less than 1 percent to $21.94 at 4 p.m. New
York time, and has increased 20 percent in the past 12 months.
Abbott rose less than 1 percent to $56.11, and is up 17 percent
in the last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s ABC network will
promote its new series &#8220;The River&#8221; by showing two full
episodes in movie theaters in a bid to lift ratings for the
second-place network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We love the idea and we think that the benefits of making
the show available to more viewers outweigh the impact it might
have on ratings for the show,&#8221; Paul Lee, president of ABC
Entertainment, said in an interview at a conference of TV
critics today in Pasadena, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABC, which lags behind CBS in prime-time ratings,
previously showed full episodes of &#8220;Modern Family&#8221; and &#8220;Last
Man Standing&#8221; on the ABC.com website, Lee said. Initial viewer
numbers for those shows grew beyond the network&#8217;s projections,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theatrical release will start in Los Angeles on Jan.
18, according to ABC. Later this month the episodes will appear
in cinemas in New York, Philadelphia and Austin, Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The River&#8221; is a one-hour drama that follows the story of
a wildlife expert who mysteriously goes missing while filming a
television show in the Amazon. His family and friends search for
him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show, from ABC Studios and Steven Spielberg&#8217;s
DreamWorks Television, is scheduled to begin airing on the
network starting Feb. 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, fell 0.3 percent to
$39.63 at the close in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and
Citigroup Inc. (C) are planning to market about $1 billion of bonds
backed by commercial property loans as soon as next week as
demand for the debt recovers amid optimism the U.S. economy can
withstand Europe&#8217;s fiscal crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal will probably be the first of its kind for 2012,
according to people familiar with the offering, who declined to
be identified because the transaction hasn&#8217;t been announced. The
New York-based banks last sold similar debt in September, when
they issued $1.7 billion in securities tied to shopping malls,
hotel and office mortgages, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks pulled back from making new loans to package into
bonds in July as Europe&#8217;s debt crisis roiled credit markets and
sent relative yields soaring. Originations have since picked up,
according to a Standard  Poor&#8217;s report last month. The ratings
company is forecasting $35 billion in 2012 sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York,
declined to comment. Scott Helfman of Citigroup, also in New
York, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to own top-ranked
commercial-mortgage bonds rather than Treasuries has declined 85
basis points to 238 basis points since Oct. 4, when it rose to a
20-month high, according to Barclays Capital CMBS AAA Super
Duper Index. The spread expanded from the 2011 low of 178 basis
points, or 1.78 percentage points, in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Despite global concerns, people are ready&#8221; for a new
deal, said Ed Shugrue, CEO of New York-based commercial mortgage
bond investor and special servicer Talmage LLC. &#8220;The market
wants to transact.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attracting New Buyers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bankers have retooled offerings sold since August by
boosting investor protection on the safest classes and
registering the debt with the Securities and Exchange Commission
to attract new buyers after demand shriveled amid the spreading
European debt turmoil. The AAA portion of the Goldman/Citigroup
deal should move &#8220;briskly,&#8221; Shugrue said, speaking in an
interview at the Commercial Real Estate Finance Council&#8217;s annual
convention in Miami. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank forecasts for commercial-mortgage bond sales in 2012
range from Wells Fargo Securities LLC predicting $25 billion to
UBS AG and Credit Suisse Group AG estimating as much as $45
billion. Wall Street banks arranged about $28 billion of the
debt last year, compared with $11.5 billion in 2010, Bloomberg
data show. Issuance peaked at $232 billion in 2007, the data
show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slowdown in lending was visible in the third quarter
last year as fewer loans paid off than in the first two
quarters, Standard  Poor&#8217;s said in a Dec. 19 report. About 56
percent of loans paid off at maturity in the third quarter, down
from more than 67 percent in the prior three-month period,
according to the New York-based rating company. A lack of new
sales chokes off funding to borrowers with debt coming due. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, sued Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. (MMI) in London&#8217;s
High Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Court papers didn&#8217;t give details on the content of
Microsoft&#8217;s claim against Motorola Mobility, which is being
acquired by Google Inc. (GOOG), maker of the Android operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit was filed Dec. 23, three days after Microsoft won
a ruling before the U.S. International Trade Commission over
claims Android-based smartphones infringe Microsoft&#8217;s patents,
and two weeks after a hearing in Germany over similar claims
alleged by Microsoft against Motorola Mobility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ITC, which issued two findings on the matter last
month, said some features of Android phones use licensed
technology without permission, rulings which fell short of
Microsoft&#8217;s original broader claims that its inventions are
widely used in Android phones. Motorola Mobility General Counsel
Scott Offer said at the time that the majority of that ruling is
favorable to the handset maker and may provide clarity on what
Microsoft owns to avoid potential infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lacretia Taylor, a spokeswoman for Redmond, Washington-
based Microsoft, didn&#8217;t have an immediate comment on the U.K.
lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gemma Priscott and Jennifer Erickson, spokeswomen for
Motorola Mobility, didn&#8217;t immediately return calls seeking
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google said Aug. 15 it would buy Libertyville, Illinois-
based Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion to obtain patents that
may be used to fend off suits targeting handsets and tablet
computers that use Android. Microsoft makes its own mobile-
operating system, Windows Phone 7, which competes with Android. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Microsoft Corporation v. Motorola Mobility
Inc., case no. HC11C04536, High Court of London, Chancery
Division (London). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo!, Augme Patent Infringement Case Trial Date Set for 2013 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury trial in Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)&#8217;s patent infringement case
brought by mobile-marketing company Augme Technologies Inc. is
set for January 2013, according to an Augme announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Augme sued Yahoo! in federal court in San
Francisco in November 2009, accusing the Sunnyvale, California
Internet company of infringing to patents related to web-page
functionality. In dispute are patents 6,594,691 and 7,269,636. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 2010 Yahoo asked the court to dismiss the case.
That was rejected by a magistrate judge in December of that
year. In September 2011 the magistrate judge issued a ruling on
the reach of the patent -- known as a &#8220;Markman&#8221; ruling -- that
Augme said &#8220;is believed to be favorable to the company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Augme Technologies Inc. (AUGT) v. Yahoo Inc.,
3:09-cv-05386-JCS, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Texas AM Says It Will Consider How to Enforce &#8216;12th Man&#8217; Mark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas AM University is in discussion with its lawyers over
a stunt that occurred at the National Football League playoff
game Jan. 8 between the Denver Broncos and Pittsburgh Steelers,
the Texas Tribune reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man parachuted into the stadium with a &#8220;12th Man&#8221; flag
trailing behind him, a trademark that is registered to the Texas
school, according to the Tribune. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flag was seen during the broadcast and the university
objects to the use of its marks by others without authorization,
the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase, which refers to football fans as the &#8220;12th
Man,&#8221; has previously been the subject of a dispute between the
school and the Seattle Seahawks NFL team, which was resolved by
a licensing agreement between the two entities, according to the
Tribune. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corbis Acquires Product-Placement Consulting Firm NMA Group &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corbis Corp., the Seattle-based photo archive company owned
by Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) founder Bill Gates, acquired a Los Angeles-
based product placement agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a joint company statement issued yesterday,
the GreenLight media-licensing unit of Corbis has acquired Norm
Marshall  Associates, which is also known as NMA Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NMA, founded in 1979, has coordinated &#8220;thousands of iconic
placements&#8221; in film and television productions. The company
also does &#8220;celebrity seeding,&#8221; through which it places branded
products in the hands of various celebrities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the companies for which it does celebrity-seeding
work is Dutch brewer Heineken NV. (HEIA) NMA says on its website that
it has &#8220;seeded&#8221; Heineken with Jeremy Renner, Bradley Cooper,
Ryan Reynolds, Ryan Kwanten, Ashton Kutcher, Mila Kunis,
Michelle Trachtenberg, Ian Somerhalder, John Krazinski and Chris
Pine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the other companies with which NMA works are General
Motors Co., Motorola Inc. and Puma SE (PUM). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NMA will operate as an independent business unit of
GreenLight, Corbis said in the statement. Terms of the
transaction weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yves St. Laurent&#8217;s Color Argument Supported by Legal Academics &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yves St. Laurent SAS/France has found a few friends in its
trademark battle with French shoe designer Christian Louboutin
SA over red soles for women&#8217;s shoes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of 11 law school professors submitted a brief Jan.
3 to a federal appeals court on behalf of St. Laurent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professors argued that the protection of single colors
in fashion markets &#8220;should be rejected in order to preserve
freedom of innovation and competition.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are arguing that the choice of red soles for the St.
Laurent shoes was an aesthetic determination rather than an
indicator of source. &#8220;If Louboutin had never existed, YSL would
have the same aesthetic reasons for choosing to use a red sole
on a red shoe,&#8221; they said, noting that the case record
indicated that St. Laurent used red soles for some of its shoes
as an esthetic element &#8220;long before Louboutin designed shoes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louboutin sued St. Laurent in federal court in Manhattan in
April, claiming the use of red shoe soles by St. Laurent
infringed its trademarks. The trial court rejected the
shoemaker&#8217;s request to bar St. Laurent shoes with red soles, and
Louboutin filed an appeal of that ruling in mid-October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November Tiffany  Co., the luxury jewelry company,
submitted a friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of Christian
Louboutin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Tiffany, which packages its jewelry items in
distinctive robin&#8217;s-egg blue boxes, weighed in on Louboutin&#8217;s
behalf. In its filing, Tiffany noted that it has a registered
trademark for its &#8220;Tiffany blue&#8221; color. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company argues that the lower court holding that a
single color for a fashion item can never be a valid trademark
&#8220;is not supported&#8221; by trademark law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Christian Louboutin SA v. Yves St. Laurent
America Inc, 11-3303, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower court case is Christian Louboutin SA v. Yves St.
Laurent America Inc., 1:11-cv-02381-VM, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woolworths Accused of Cloning Bottler&#8217;s Entire Product Line &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woolworths Holdings Ltd. (WHL) has become the target of a
campaign on one of Facebook Inc.&#8217;s pages following the
retailer&#8217;s adoption of a new line of soft drinks, South Africa&#8217;s
Times newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owner of Frankie&#8217;s soft drinks, a bottler in South
Africa&#8217;s Natal region, claimed the retail giant cloned his
entire product range, according to the Times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This happened after Frankie&#8217;s Mike Schmidt met with
Woolworths about carrying his products and was told they were
out of character for the chain, the Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woolworths managing director Zyda Rylands told the Times
that her company hasn&#8217;t infringed &#8220;any copyright, intellectual
property nor registered trademark.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elisa Blocks Pirate Bay Website Pending Finnish Court Appeal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elisa Oyj (ELI1V), Finland&#8217;s largest wireless carrier by
subscribers, has temporarily blocked the Pirate Bay file-sharing
website to users by court order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elisa banned access to the website after receiving an
enforcement order related to a court ruling in October, the
Helsinki-based company said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.
The Helsinki District Court ruled against Elisa based on a
complaint by the local branch of the International Federation of
the Phonographic Industry, Elisa said. The company has appealed
the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Swedish-founded Pirate Bay site enables downloading of
digitized music and films using software called BitTorrent which
enables complete works to be assembled from pieces on other
users&#8217; computers. Telenor ASA (TEL), Norway&#8217;s largest operator,
successfully argued in a Norwegian court in 2010 that the
company shouldn&#8217;t be ordered to block the website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;According to information received from the collection
authorities, we have to implement the measures requested until
the court case is completed,&#8221; Henri Korpi, Elisa&#8217;s head of
consumer subscriptions business, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The parties should now concentrate on measures that would
really reduce piracy,&#8221; Korpi said. &#8220;That includes making
digital distribution available at a reasonable price and at the
same time as releases on other media.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The block affects users of both Elisa and Saunalahti
branded services in Finland and covers more than 30 Pirate Bay
domains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IFPI and the Copyright Information and Anti-Piracy
Center also filed blocking actions against TeliaSonera AB and
DNA Oy in Finland on Nov. 25, said Antti Kotilainen, executive
director of the anti-piracy center, which represents the IFPI in
defending the copyrights of major record companies in Finland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decisions in those cases are expected in February or March,
Kotilainen said. TeliaSonera, Elisa and DNA together account for
80 percent of broadband users in Finland, Kotilainen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pirate Bay&#8217;s four founders were each sentenced to one year
in prison in 2009 by a Swedish court. Three of the men had their
jail sentences reduced on appeal in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of New York Mellon Corp. and
federal prosecutors are close to settling some claims in a
government lawsuit accusing the bank of overcharging customers
for foreign-exchange trading, according to a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan requested a one-
week extension for BNY Mellon to respond to the complaint
because the two sides &#8220;are presently close to reaching an
agreement that would resolve certain claims,&#8221; according to
letter filed yesterday with U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan.
The judge granted the request, according to the court docket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bharara sued New York-based BNY Mellon on Oct. 4, the same
day the bank was sued by New York Attorney General Eric
Schneiderman for allegedly defrauding public pension funds of $2
billion over 10 years. Attorneys general in Virginia and Florida
and some California counties filed similar complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases center on the pricing of small foreign-exchange
transactions handled automatically by the custody banks on
behalf of pension funds, a service known as standing
instruction. In some of the cases the banks have said they acted
as a principal, selling one currency for another in arms-length
transactions at a set price that customers were free to accept
or reject. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Heine, a spokesman for BNY Mellon, didn&#8217;t return a
phone call or e-mail seeking comment on the government&#8217;s court
filing after regular business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.,
11-6969, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Park City Eatery Balks at Credit Card Fines in Rare Court Fight &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen and Cissy McComb say they managed their Italian
eatery in Park City, Utah, for more than two decades without
running afoul of security rules of Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA)
-- until they were accused of mishandling data and opening the
door to $1.26 million in fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The McCombs, who opened Cisero&#8217;s in 1985, are now in a
legal fight with the bank that processed their credit charges
and, indirectly, with what they say are card networks that
change rules without notice, impose unfair one-sided contracts
and allow the taking of money from merchants&#8217; accounts with no
proof of fault, Bloomberg News&#8217;s Thom Weidlich reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The couple sued, saying they didn&#8217;t break MasterCard and
Visa rules, that there was no security lapse and that no acts of
fraud were specifically claimed. The fraud was conjured from
unexplained and unsupported data, they said in court papers
filed in state court in Park City. Their suit may be the first
court challenge to penalties under the card networks&#8217; security
procedures, said one of their lawyers, W. Stephen Cannon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The McCombs are in litigation against Elavon Inc., an
Atlanta-based payment-processing company, and US Bank. Both are
units of US Bancorp (USB), Minnesota&#8217;s largest bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US Bancorp is a middleman in Cisero&#8217;s credit business, out
of sight of customers who may be aware only of Visa, MasterCard
and the banks that issue the cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the so-called acquiring bank, US Bank provided Cisero&#8217;s
with access to payment networks and maintained an account from
which it paid the restaurant for credit-card purchases, the
McCombs said. Elavon processed the payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The McCombs countersued in August after US Bancorp sued
them for $82,692 in fines imposed by Visa and MasterCard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teri Charest, a spokeswoman for US Bancorp, said in an e-
mail that the bank denied any liability will fight the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denise Dunckel, a spokeswoman for San Francisco-based Visa,
and James Issokson, a spokesman for Purchase, New York-based
MasterCard, declined to comment on the lawsuit. Their companies
aren&#8217;t defendants in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Elavon Inc. v. Cisero&#8217;s Inc., 100500480, Utah
Third Judicial District Court, Summit County (Park City). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wall Street Groups Seek Delay of CFTC Position Limits Rule &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Wall Street groups asked a federal appeals court to
delay a U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission rule that
limits commodity speculation, saying the regulation is already
imposing &#8220;irreversible harms.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc.
and Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association filed
an emergency request yesterday in Washington urging a three-
judge panel to put the rule on hold while the court considers
their legal challenge. The groups asked the court to issue a
ruling by Jan. 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The rule will force market participants to forgo
efficient trading strategies, impair their ability to hedge
against risks, and potentially require them to restructure their
businesses,&#8221; the groups said in the filing. &#8220;These costs will
mount now absent a stay, and they would be impossible to recoup
if the rule is invalidated -- as it likely will be.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The groups, in one of the financial industry&#8217;s highest-
profile efforts to weaken last year&#8217;s Dodd-Frank law, filed
lawsuits challenging the rule in two federal courts in
Washington last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They argue that the CFTC used a flawed analysis of Dodd-
Frank when it decided to impose the restrictions. The
associations also said the CFTC failed to properly weigh the
rule&#8217;s costs and benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In yesterday&#8217;s filing with the U.S. Court of Appeals, the
groups argue that their challenge will likely succeed, noting
that a majority of commissioners concluded the rule was
unnecessary and would have rejected it &#8220;but for one
commissioner&#8217;s mistaken view that Congress required it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They said the rule will impose costs on the economy because
some companies may not invest in other companies as a way of
avoiding the aggregation requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Adamske, a CFTC spokesman, declined to comment on
the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is International Swaps and Derivatives Association
v. CFTC, 11-01491, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks Blame Countrywide for U.K. Mortgage Losses in 97 Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suninder Sandha bought his luxury apartment in Coleorton
Hall, a 19th century country mansion near Leicester in central
England, using a 1.2 million-pound loan ($1.86 million) from
Barclays Plc (BARC) in 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the property market collapsed two years later, Sandha
couldn&#8217;t make his mortgage payments and Barclays seized the
apartment, selling it for 500,000 pounds. The lender has now
sued Countrywide Plc (CWD), whose surveying unit valued it at the peak
of the boom, for its losses, according to court papers,
Bloomberg News&#8217; Kit Chellel reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit is one of 38 filed last year in London&#8217;s High
Court against Countrywide, the nation&#8217;s largest residential
property broker, by lenders including Barclays, Lloyds Banking
Group Plc (LLOY) and GMAC-RFC. That&#8217;s more claims than any of the four
largest U.K. banks faced in 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. As many as 97 lawsuits have been filed since 2007
against Countrywide, bought that year by private-equity firm
Apollo Management LP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These banks have incurred huge losses and they are
looking for someone to blame,&#8221; said Alexandra Anderson, a
partner at law firm Reynolds Porter Chamberlain LLP representing
surveyors including Countrywide. &#8220;Often the blame is
themselves, and the lending practices they had.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countrywide, now also owned by Oaktree Capital Management
LLC (OAKTRZ) and Alchemy Partners LLP, said in an e-mailed statement it
had seen a considerable increase in professional negligence
claims, particularly from now-defunct lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will continue to defend our position when we believe
we have fulfilled our responsibilities,&#8221; Countrywide said. &#8220;If
an error is made, then we do seek to settle with claimants.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The London company isn&#8217;t affiliated with Countrywide
Financial Corp., the Calabasas, California-based subprime lender
acquired by Bank of America Corp. in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays spokeswoman Emma Austin declined to comment on its
lawsuit. U.K. telephone directories online didn&#8217;t list an
address for Sandha since he left Coleorton Hall and the lawsuit
didn&#8217;t provide details of where he is now. Apollo spokesman
Charles Zehren declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clean Water Act Tool Used by EPA Questioned at High Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Supreme Court justices voiced concern that the
Environmental Protection Agency is overreaching in enforcing
federal statutes, signaling that they may blunt a favorite
agency enforcement tool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearing arguments yesterday in a case involving an Idaho
couple seeking to build a new home, the justices suggested they
are likely to rule that people accused by federal regulators of
violating environmental laws have a right to immediately take
their case to a federal judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case, which has with ramifications for energy companies
and manufacturers, may weaken the EPA&#8217;s so-called administrative
compliance orders. The agency issues as many as 3,000 such
orders each year to businesses and individuals, demanding an end
to alleged environmental violations and applying so much
pressure that those accused typically give in before the agency
has to justify the action before a judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fight involves a 0.63-acre property near the banks of
Priest Lake in northern Idaho. In 2007 Chantell and Michael
Sackett had begun preparing the land to build a three-bedroom
home, when EPA officials ordered work to halt. The agency said
that the property was a wetland and that the Sacketts couldn&#8217;t
build without obtaining a permit under the Clean Water Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EPA then ordered the Sacketts to restore the land by
removing piles of fill material and replanting the vegetation
they had cleared. The written order threatened the couple with
fines of as much as $32,500 a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sacketts contend they have a constitutional right to
seek judicial review of that administrative compliance order
right away. A federal appeals court said the couple had to wait
until regulators sought to enforce the order by asking a federal
court to impose a fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration and the EPA argue that the couple
has ample avenues short of going to court for contesting the
order without risking fines. Among other options, the Sacketts
could apply for a permit, the government said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justices from across the ideological spectrum yesterday
questioned the adequacy of those options and the government&#8217;s
contention that Congress didn&#8217;t authorize judicial review of
administrative compliance orders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Sackett v. EPA, 10-1062, U.S. Supreme Court
(Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JJ (JNJ) Opposes Texas in $1 Billion Risperdal Marketing Trial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson  Johnson, which has lost judgments of almost $660
million over the marketing of its antipsychotic drug Risperdal,
began a trial yesterday in which Texas is seeking damages of
more than $1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State Attorney General Greg Abbott accused JJ of paying
officials to get Risperdal on approved drug lists, marketing it
for unapproved uses to children and the elderly, and lying about
its effects. The case in state court in Austin was filed by a
whistle-blower and joined by the state, which is seeking
repayment of Medicaid payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas is asking for reimbursement of $579 million, said Tom
Melsheimer, a lawyer for the whistle-blower. The amount could be
tripled by jurors under state law. In addition, jurors will
decide the number of violations and set a penalty of as much as
$10,000 apiece, if the state wins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be massive,&#8221; said Patrick Burns of the
advocacy group Taxpayers Against Fraud. &#8220;They&#8217;ll lose in Texas,
and then they&#8217;re going to face litigation from stockholders for
failing to settle this.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result may be a record false-claims verdict, Burns said
by phone from Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A jury weighing only the claim that the company downplayed
the drug&#8217;s risks awarded Louisiana $257.7 million in 2010. A
judge in South Carolina last year ordered JJ to pay $327
million over Risperdal sold in the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JJ and its Janssen unit, which sold Risperdal, deny any
wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are committed to ethical business practices, and have
policies in place to ensure that our products are only promoted
for their FDA-approved indication,&#8221; Teresa Mueller, a JJ
spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. The company will fight the
allegations, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jury selection in Austin started yesterday. The trial is
scheduled to last about three weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is State of Texas ex rel. Jones v. Janssen LP, D-
1GV-04-001288, District Court, Travis County, Texas (Austin). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CVC Didn&#8217;t Know of F1 Payments to Gribkowsky, Court Told &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CVC Capital Partner Ltd.&#8217;s managing partner told a Munich
court he wasn&#8217;t informed about payments made to former
Bayerische Landesbank Chief Risk Officer Gerhard Gribkowsky over
the 2005 sale of Formula One racing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donald MacKenzie, who testified at Gribkowsky&#8217;s bribery
trial in Munich yesterday, said he and CVC only heard about the
issue when the German press reported it a year ago. MacKenzie
said Formula One Chief Executive Officer Bernie Ecclestone first
told him he didn&#8217;t know about the payments before explaining
them at a Feb. 2 meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors charged Gribkowsky, who managed Munich-based
BayernLB&#8217;s interest in Formula One, with accepting bribes,
breach of trust and tax evasion. They claim he received $44
million in bribes to facilitate the sale of the bank&#8217;s 47
percent stake in Formula One to CVC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gribkowsky demanded $50 million from Ecclestone as a reward
for consenting to the deal and threatened to disclose possible
tax violations by the Bambino family trust run by Ecclestone&#8217;s
wife at the time, prosecutors said. Gribkowsky denies the
charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MacKenzie testified he wasn&#8217;t informed about a separate
agreement under which Ecclestone would get $100 million. While
it may have been a breach of the Formula One sales agreement not
to disclose it, arrangements in which shareholders pay
executives an incentive are common, said MacKenzie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Had I known about it at the time, I would have understood
it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We would have renegotiated the terms of the
deal, though, and that would have delayed it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potential Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global U.K. Administrators Threaten Client Money Lawsuits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Administrators at MF Global Holdings Ltd (MFGLQ).&#8217;s U.K. unit said
they have threatened to sue large financial institutions who
were unwilling to release money they held for the failed
broker&#8217;s clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some companies &#8220;have a number of positions across the
group and they are generally hesitant&#8221; to hand over
unsegregated funds worth a total of more than 1 billion pounds
($1.5 billion), Richard Heis, the lead administrator at KPMG
LLP, told MF Global clients and creditors at a meeting in London
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While administrators had encountered few problems
persuading outside institutions to release segregated funds,
which are protected, unsegregated accounts were tied up because
of &#8220;legal arguments about potential set-off,&#8221; Heis said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK),
Citigroup Inc. and LCH.Clearnet Group Ltd. were among the
depository institutions holding cash and assets for MF Global
customers, according to documents released by KPMG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global Holdings Ltd., based in New York, was the fifth-
largest financial company to file for bankruptcy when it sought
protection on Oct. 31 after making losing bets on European
sovereign debt. KPMG was appointed to supervise the special
administration of the broker&#8217;s London unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for JP Morgan, Citigroup, LCH and BNY Mellon
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corzine Sued by Montana Farmers Over Futures Account Money &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Corzine, former chief executive officer of collapsed
commodity brokerage MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ), was sued for fraud
by Montana farmers who claim he oversaw the misappropriation of
their commodity trading account funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit filed yesterday by three farmers and a cattle-
raising operation in Montana seeks to represent a nationwide
group of commodities futures customers whose money went missing
amid the $41 billion bankruptcy of MF Global, parent of the
futures brokerage that is being liquidated. A trustee is looking
for $1.2 billion or more in money missing from commodity
customers&#8217; accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corzine, the former governor of New Jersey, and other
executives at MF Global made &#8220;knowingly false statements&#8221; to
induce the plaintiffs to enter into contracts with the
brokerage, according to the complaint filed in federal court in
Missoula, Montana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The executives failed to disclose to customers that their
money was used to finance MF Global&#8217;s bad bets on European
sovereign debt, the farmers said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit also names JPMorgan Chase  Co., MF Global&#8217;s
clearing broker and custodian, as a defendant, alleging it
failed to detect suspicious activity at the brokerage and aided
and abetted in the fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corzine has said he doesn&#8217;t know where the missing money is
and didn&#8217;t authorize any misuse of customer funds that may have
occurred. Corzine is the defendant in at least nine lawsuits
before a federal judge in Manhattan that seek compensation for
losses from the company&#8217;s bankruptcy, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary Sedarat, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to comment
on the lawsuit. Steven Goldberg, a spokesman for Corzine, didn&#8217;t
return an e-mail seeking comment about the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Klinker v. JPMorgan Chase., 12-0005, U.S.
District Court, District of Montana (Missoula). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olympus Sues President, 18 Other Executives Over Fraud &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olympus Corp. (7733) said it is seeking damages from its
president, Shuichi Takayama, and 18 other current and former
executives over their roles in a $1.7 billion cover-up of
losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Japanese camera maker&#8217;s auditors filed the claims at
the Tokyo District Court on Jan. 8, Olympus said in a statement
yesterday. The company&#8217;s shares surged as much as 28 percent on
investor optimism that it would keep its listing on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange that had been under threat because of the fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olympus managers involved in the scheme to hide investment
losses over more than a decade caused 86 billion yen ($1.1
billion) in damages to the company, according to the findings of
an independent panel released yesterday. Former President
Michael Woodford, who was fired after he challenged the board on
takeover and accounting practices, is also taking legal action
against the company over his dismissal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s all part of the natural fallout to be expected with
each party trying to stake their positions and to protect their
legal interests,&#8221; Eugene Tan, assistant professor of law at the
Singapore Management University, said yesterday following
Japanese media reports that the lawsuits had been filed. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
see suits and countersuits taking place in the next couple of
weeks, if not months.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is seeking as much as 3.6 billion yen ($46.8
million) in damages from executives including ex-Chairman
Tsuyoshi Kikukawa, it said. Takayama, who took over after
Woodford, is being sued for as much as 500 million yen, the
company said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former company auditor, Hideo Yamada, and Hisashi Mori,
fired as executive director over his role, are being sued for
3.01 billion yen and 2.81 billion yen, respectively, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olympus spokesmen weren&#8217;t immediately available to comment,
and repeated attempts since the scandal broke to contact
officials involved, including visits to their homes, have
failed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company inflated fees to advisers on the $2.1 billion
acquisition of Gyrus Group Plc in 2008 and overpaid in
purchasing three Japanese companies with the intention of
increasing goodwill, the independent panel investigating the
fraud said last month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-CDR Financial Executives Plead Guilty in Fraud Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former CDR Financial Products Inc. Chief Financial Officer
Z. Stewart Wolmark and Vice President Evan Zarefsky pleaded
guilty in a multimillion dollar scheme to rig municipal bond
investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pleas yesterday before U.S. District Judge Victor
Marrero in federal court in New York came a week before opening
arguments were scheduled to be heard in a trial over alleged
bid- and auction-rigging in the municipal bond market. CDR
founder and former chief executive officer David Rubin and his
Beverly Hills, California-based firm pleaded guilty on Dec. 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wolmark, 56, admitted in court yesterday to manipulating
bids during his tenure at CDR from 1998 to November 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;During that period I participated with others in an
agreement to allocate and rig bids,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I also
knowingly participated in an agreement with others to manipulate
the bids in return for inflated fees paid to CDR,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDR was hired by public entities that issue municipal bonds
to act as their broker and conduct what were to be competitive
bidding process for contracts for the investment of municipal
bond proceeds, according to prosecutors. Instead, CDR employees
allegedly took kickbacks for running sham auctions for the
investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wolmark and Zarefsky, 37, each pleaded guilty to two counts
of conspiracy and one count of wire fraud. They face as long as
35 years in prison on all counts, the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zarefsky told Marrero that soon after he joined CDR in
April 2000, he became involved in the conspiracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I knew that it was wrong but then later I subsequently
came to understand that it was unlawful,&#8221; Zarefsky said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharis Pozen, Acting Assistant Attorney General in charge
of the Justice Department&#8217;s Antitrust Division said, &#8220;Our
investigation into the municipal bond derivatives industry has
now led to guilty pleas by 12 financial executives and charges
against six others.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In court, Michael G. McGovern, a lawyer for Wolmark, and
Daniel L. Zelenko, a lawyer for Zarefsky, told the judge they
disputed the length of the sentences their clients face as
calculated by the government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Rubin/Chambers, 09-cr-1058, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Trader David Slaine Helped Lead to Rajaratnam, U.S. Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Slaine, a former Galleon Group LLC employee who
pleaded guilty to criminal charges, was crucial to the
prosecution of Zvi Goffer&#8217;s insider-trading ring and helped lead
investigators to Raj Rajaratnam and Primary Global Research LLC,
U.S. prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slaine wore a wire to record dozens of conversations with
Goffer and others, helping to spur what became the biggest probe
of insider trading at hedge funds, prosecutors from the office
of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan said yesterday in a
letter to U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan. Calling Slaine&#8217;s
cooperation &#8220;nothing short of extraordinary,&#8221; the government
asked for leniency when he&#8217;s sentenced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Evidence gathered by Slaine played a role in, among other
things, the successful prosecution of Raj Rajaratnam and his co-
conspirators, as well as the defendants in the Primary Global
Research case,&#8221; according to the letter. &#8220;His assistance was
the launching point for many successful and ongoing criminal
investigations of multiple insider trading networks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slaine, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy and securities
fraud in December 2009, testified at the trial of Goffer, his
brother Emanuel Goffer and Michael Kimelman that he cooperated
with federal agents for about 2 1/2 years to try to avoid
prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slaine faces as long as 25 years in prison when he&#8217;s
sentenced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A co-founder of Galleon Group, Rajaratnam reported to
Federal Medical Center Devens in Ayer, Massachusetts, last month
to begin an 11-year prison sentence. He was convicted by a
federal jury in May of 14 counts of conspiracy and securities
fraud for trading on inside information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Goffer, 10-cr-00056, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Refco Lawyer Collins&#8217;s Conviction Thrown Out on Appeal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conviction of Joseph Collins, Refco Inc. (RFXCQ)&#8217;s former
outside lawyer, was reversed by an appeals court that found the
trial judge improperly instructed a juror outside the presence
of his lawyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collins, convicted in 2009 of aiding Refco&#8217;s former chief
executive officer Phillip Bennett and other executives defraud
investors of $2.4 billion, is entitled to a new trial, a three-
judge panel of the New York-based federal appeals court said in
a ruling yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collins was convicted of five of 14 criminal counts against
him, including two counts of wire fraud, two counts of
securities fraud and one count of conspiracy. Jurors were unable
to reach a verdict on the other nine counts. During
deliberations in the case, jurors told the judge that there had
been threats of violence in the jury room, with one juror
threatening to cut off the finger of another one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We cannot say with fair assurance that the judgment was
not substantially swayed by the district court&#8217;s errors in this
case,&#8221; U.S. Circuit Judge Denny Chin wrote in an opinion
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;After this long fight, we are very gratified by the Court
of Appeals&#8217; decision,&#8221; William Schwartz, a lawyer for Collins,
said in an e-mailed statement. Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for
the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan, declined to comment on the
ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collins, a former corporate lawyer with the Chicago firm
Mayer Brown LLP (1120L), was accused of helping Refco&#8217;s management
conceal transactions from lenders and investors that hid losses
incurred by the New York-based firm. He was sentenced to seven
years in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Collins, 07-cr-1170, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Litigation Departments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS)&#8217;s Grossman Succeeds Barron as Chief Legal Officer &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley&#8217;s chief legal officer, Frank Barron, is
leaving this year and will be succeeded by Eric Grossman, who
was most recently global head of legal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To ensure a seamless transition, I have asked Frank to
remain &#8216;of counsel&#8217; to the firm through mid-year,&#8221; Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said yesterday in an
internal memo to employees. &#8220;Frank will step down from the
Operating Committee but remain on the Management Committee until
his departure.&#8221; Mark Lake, a spokesman for New York-based
Morgan Stanley, confirmed the memo&#8217;s contents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, the sixth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
hired Barron, 60, in July 2010 after Gary Lynch, then the firm&#8217;s
chief legal officer, said he planned to leave. Grossman, 44, had
been a candidate for Lynch&#8217;s job before Barron, a litigation
partner at Cravath, Swaine  Moore LLP, joined the bank, a
person briefed on the matter said last year. Grossman joined
Morgan Stanley in 2006 and is a former partner at Davis Polk 
Wardwell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News Corp. (NWSA) Hires Williams  Connolly&#8217;s Zweifach as Top Lawyer &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News Corp., embroiled in a hacking scandal that saw it
shutter one of its U.K. newspapers in July, hired Gerson
Zweifach, a partner with law firm Williams  Connolly LLP, as
group general counsel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zweifach, 58, will be a senior executive vice president,
reporting to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rupert
Murdoch, the New York-based company said yesterday in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are fortunate to have such a renowned attorney join
our company as we navigate the rapidly changing media
landscape,&#8221; Murdoch said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zweifach, who has worked at Washington-based Williams 
Connolly for almost 30 years managing antitrust and libel cases,
succeeds Lawrence Jacobs, who left in June to pursue other
opportunities. Janet Nova, a board member of the News
International unit, who served as interim general counsel for
the past six months, will remain with the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As top legal officer, the new general counsel will probably
become point person for News Corp.&#8217;s handling of the phone-
hacking scandal which led to the closing of the company&#8217;s News
of the World tabloid in the U.K. and at least 21 arrests. Board
member Joel Klein, a former federal prosecutor, is overseeing
the company&#8217;s internal probe of its newspaper journalists&#8217;
actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Law Firm Deacons Plans Independent Expansion in China &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deacons, Hong Kong&#8217;s oldest law firm, plans to remain
independent as it prepares for the expansion of its three
offices in China when rules are changed to let overseas firms
advise on local laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We want to replicate our Hong Kong capabilities on the
mainland when regulations permit,&#8221; Deacons Executive Partner
Jeremy Lam said in a Jan. 4 interview. Lam said he hopes Hong
Kong firms such as Deacons will be allowed to advise on Chinese
law within the next five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deacons, founded in 1851 in what was then a British colony,
was the first non-Chinese law firm to be allowed a third
representative office on the mainland in 2005, eight years after
Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule. China has given law firms
from the city, which retains a separate legal system,
preferential access to the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Deacons has been approached by U.S. law firms Lam
declined to identity, it isn&#8217;t discussing strategic alliances
with anyone and is pursuing a strategy of independence, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That contrasts with other Hong Kong firms such as Johnson
Stokes  Master which has merged with Chicago-based Mayer Brown
LLP to form the Asian city&#8217;s largest law firm with 201 fee
earners, according to trade publication Asia Legal Business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other mergers, Arculli Fong  Ng combined with Beijing-
based King  Wood&#8217;s Hong Kong office in 2009, and that
partnership will merge with the Hong Kong office of Australia&#8217;s
Mallesons Stephen Jaques to have more than 130 lawyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deacons, with 191 lawyers in Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Beijing
and Shanghai, ended alliances with San Francisco-based Graham 
James LLP in 2000 and with the 600-lawyer Australian firm
formerly known as Sly  Weigall in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong firm ended its remaining alliances with firms
in Taiwan, Malaysia and Thailand at the end of last year, Lam
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;California-blend gasoline in Los
Angeles tumbled after Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) said the Torrance (XOTOCRUD) oil
refinery in Southern California was restoring production
following two power failures Jan. 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbob in Los Angeles dropped 4 cents to a premium of 4.25
cents a gallon against gasoline futures traded on the New York
Mercantile Exchange at 5:17 p.m. New York time, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery of the fuel fell
4.95 cents to $2.8058 a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon may flare gases at the 150,000-barrel-a-day Torrance
refinery through Jan. 15 as the plant recovers from two
&#8220;external power interruptions,&#8221; according to a notice from the
Irving, Texas-based company to the South Coast Air Quality
Management District. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasoline inventories on the West Coast, known as the Padd 5
region, rose 5.4 percent to 30.2 million barrels in the week
ended Jan. 6 from a week earlier, the highest level since
August, the Energy Department said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbob in San Francisco (MOGSD85P) dropped 4.75 cents to a discount of
2.25 cents to futures, its lowest level since Aug. 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend diesel in Los Angeles (DIEILCAD) slipped 0.25 cent to
a premium of 5.5 cents against Nymex heating oil futures. The
same fuel in San Francisco (DIEISCAD) was 6 cents over futures, the highest
margin since Nov. 10, for a third straight day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West Coast stocks of distillate fuel oil jumped 11 percent
to 14.9 million barrels last week, the highest level in almost a
year, the Energy Department said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. energy company, said fourth-quarter profit was
&#8220;significantly below&#8221; third-quarter results after maintenance
work at a California refinery and the sale of a U.K. plant
curbed fuel output. The shares fell more than 2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit from the company&#8217;s oil and natural-gas wells was
comparable with third-quarter performance, the San Ramon,
California-based company said in a statement today. Chevron&#8217;s
refining business was &#8220;near break even,&#8221; according to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s U.S. refineries processed 18 percent less
crude during October and November than during the final three
months of 2010 because of maintenance work that idled part of a
California refinery, Chevron said. Processing rates at overseas
plants slumped 24 percent during the same period after the
August sale of a Welsh refinery to Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron dropped $2.22, or 2.1 percent, to $105.55 at 5:23
p.m. after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Before today, the stock had gained 21 percent in the past year.
Chevron rose 17 percent in 2011, the second-largest increase in
the NYSE Arca Oil index after Houston-based Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO),
which advanced 30 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assets Sold &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer John Watson has been selling
refining and retail-fuel assets in Europe and Africa to
concentrate on higher-profit oil production and gas liquefaction
projects. Chevron is scheduled to release full fourth-quarter
results on Jan. 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s wells pumped the equivalent of 2.64 million
barrels of crude a day on average during the first two months of
the fourth quarter, a 5.3 percent decline from the full fourth
quarter of 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to today&#8217;s announcement, Chevron was expected to
report per-share profit of $3.27 for the fourth quarter, based
on the average estimate of 18 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.
That would be a 24 percent increase from $2.64 a year-earlier.
The company has 21 buy recommendations from analysts, five holds
and one sell rating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CTC Media (CTCM) Inc., a Russian television
network traded in the U.S., slid the most this month after
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) cut its recommendation on the stock,
citing declining audience share and slowing advertising revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CTC Media sank 1.1 percent to $9.15 by 4 p.m. in New York,
the biggest one-day decline since Dec. 30. Goldman reduced the
Moscow-based company&#8217;s rating to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;buy&#8221; and
cut its 12-month target price to $12.30 from $13.60, according
to a report by analysts including Alexander Balakhnin and Daria Fomina e-mailed today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average daily share of viewers for CTC&#8217;s television
channel, the company&#8217;s biggest source of advertising revenue and
Russia&#8217;s fifth-most-popular national station, fell to below 7
percent last month, from 7.5 percent in November and 7.9 percent
in October, according to weekly data from TNS Gallup Media. CTC
uses TNS data in its financial reports. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) won a record number of U.S. patents in 2011, its 19th
straight year on top, as some Asian competitors advanced in the
rankings at the expense of Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Intel Corp. (INTC) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider, gained
6,180 patents last year, researcher IFI Claims Patent Services
said in a statement. Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) was second, its
growth outpacing IBM, and Canon Inc. replaced Microsoft as
third. Panasonic Corp. (6752) moved up to No. 4 and Toshiba Corp. (6502)
advanced to fifth spot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A patent portfolio spanning from computer memory to online
shopping provides Armonk, New York-based IBM with licensing
revenue and protection against intellectual-property
infringement lawsuits. That means IBM is spending less time in
courts than competitors, Manny Schecter, IBM&#8217;s chief patent
counsel, said in an interview before the numbers were released. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Everyone knows that if they attempt to bring their patent
portfolio against us that they will be met with an equal and
opposite force -- and it will be formidable,&#8221; Schecter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM also uses its patents to affect trends in technology:
If it wishes to promote certain standards, it may tell other
companies it won&#8217;t sue anyone innovating in that area even if
its patents are infringed. So far, the strategy has attracted
clients for consulting on intellectual property management and
requests to testify before Congress, Schecter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asian Surge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, IBM&#8217;s reign may be threatened in coming years by
Asian rivals, IFI said. Samsung&#8217;s 8 percent growth in patents
outpaced IBM&#8217;s 5 percent, and in the number of patent
applications Samsung has eclipsed IBM for two years, the
researcher said. Patent applications are an indication of future
patent grants, IFI said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;IBM seems to have a successful strategy that keeps them in
a very prominent position,&#8221; Mike Baycroft, IFI chief executive
officer, said in an interview. &#8220;It may not last. As the Asians
file more and more, especially large companies like Samsung,
there is a possibility that they will take over that No. 1
position.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung, based in Suwon, South Korea, gained 4,894 patents
last year, while Canon won 2,821. Microsoft dropped to sixth
place in the rankings, while Intel fell to 16th from eighth.
There were eight Asian and two U.S. companies in the top 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all, the U.S. issued a record 224,505 patents in 2011,
up 2 percent from 2010, Madison, Connecticut-based IFI said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perforating Machine &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patents are part of IBM Chief Executive Officer Virginia &#8220;Ginni&#8221; Rometty&#8217;s strategy as the company seeks to expand in
areas such as emerging markets, cloud computing and analytics.
Rometty, the first woman at the helm in IBM&#8217;s 100-year history,
took over from Sam Palmisano Jan. 1 and tries to meet a goal of
adding $20 billion in new revenue between 2010 and 2015.
Analysts on average estimate IBM will report $107.2 billion in
sales for 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company invests about $6 billion in research and
development each year, and makes about $1 billion in licensing
revenue, said Chris Andrews, a spokesman. IBM has a 250-person
team managing its patents, and it provides training for more
than 8,000 inventors. They record about 20,000 breakthroughs
annually, and only some are submitted for patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM rose 0.6 percent to $182.32 at the close in New York.
The stock reached a record in 2011 and advanced 25 percent for
the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM won its first patent for a perforating machine on July
25, 1911. Since then, the company&#8217;s inventors have received more
than 70,000 patents, 34,000 of which are active, Andrews said.
The company patented DRAM cells, which became the standard for
computer memory, in 1968. There are also non-computer
inventions, like a laser technique that went on to become the
foundation for LASIK eye surgery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* The Top 10 U.S. Patent Winners of 2011:
1)  IBM                       6,180
2)  Samsung                   4,894

&lt;p&gt;Yandex NV (YNDX), the operator of Russia&#8217;s
most popular Internet search engine, climbed after Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. raised its recommendation on the stock to &#8220;buy&#8221;
from &#8220;neutral&#8221; and listed the company as one of the &#8220;best buy
ideas&#8221; in the European media and telecommunications industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yandex gained 1.8 percent to $19.20 in New York, after
earlier jumping as much as 5.5 percent, the biggest intraday
advance since Dec. 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American depositary receipts of OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT),
known as MTS, advanced 3.4 percent to $16.27, a five-week high,
after Goldman Sachs reiterated its &#8220;buy&#8221; recommendation on the
stock, also making it one of its &#8220;best buy ideas,&#8221; according
to an e-mailed report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yandex is among companies that are &#8220;in the top quartile
among the European media companies as they benefit from exposure
to structural growth themes and economies that are expanding
faster,&#8221; Goldman analysts, including Moscow-based Alexander Balakhnin, Daria Fomina, Maxim Loginov and London-based Andrew Howard, said in the report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illinois&#8217;s (STOIL1) cost to borrow relative
to top-rated issuers tripled from 2009 when it sold $800 million
of bonds today, after its credit rating was cut by Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service to the lowest among U.S. states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $525 million tax-exempt part of today&#8217;s sale included
10-year general-obligation bonds priced to yield 3.1 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That&#8217;s 110 basis points
more than the 2 percent yield of top-rated 10-year debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 10-year bond sold on Sept. 16, 2009, the last time
Illinois took competitive bids for tax-exempt general
obligations, was priced at 37 basis points above top-rated debt.
A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s cited &#8220;chronic&#8221; late bill payments and unfunded
retirement obligations when it cut $32 billion of Illinois
general-obligation debt one level on Jan. 6 to A2, the sixth-
highest rating and the lowest among U.S. states. The pension has
assets to cover only 45 percent of projected liabilities, the
least of any state, according to a study by Bloomberg Rankings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale benefited from the lowest yields on AAA rated
general obligations since at least 1991, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolute rates on the tax-exempt sale for capital projects
were the lowest for Illinois since at least 1976, according to
Kelly Kraft, a spokeswoman for Governor Pat Quinn&#8217;s budget
office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These bond bids make clear that investors know we are
taking steps to correct the decades of fiscal mismanagement in
our state,&#8221; David Vaught, director of the state Office of
Management and Budget, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debt will pay for projects including schools and
transportation in the fifth-most-populous U.S. state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) beat seven other bidders for the $525
million of tax-exempt bonds. JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) outbid eight
banks for the $275 million of taxable bonds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will pay
$993,841 to settle a suit brought by a group of computer
technicians who said they weren&#8217;t paid overtime for their work
as contractors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parties asked U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley in
Manhattan in a filing today to approve the settlement. Forty-one
technicians returned claim forms, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The parties reached the settlement agreement after an
arm&#8217;s-length mediation held in March 2011,&#8221; according to the
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the lawsuit, the technicians said they deserved overtime
pay for working more than 40 hours a week. Work weeks topped 70
hours, and more than 100 employees in New York and New Jersey
were underpaid as a result, they said in the complaint filed in
May 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Wells, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to comment
on the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bardouille v. Goldman Sachs  Co., 10-cv-4285,

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is making plans for
a companywide restructuring of its marketing operations, a move
that may include hundreds of job cuts, according to people
familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plans haven&#8217;t been settled and could change, according
to the people, who asked not to be named because the review
isn&#8217;t public. Job cuts are unlikely to involve thousands of
employees, the people said. Initial steps could be announced
within the next 30 days, according to one person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes would eliminate overlap in job responsibilities
and are designed to help the company better respond to threats
from Apple Inc. (AAPL), Google (GOOG) Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., which are
increasingly targeting Microsoft&#8217;s corporate-computing
customers. Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer
doesn&#8217;t think the company is getting enough return on the
billions it spends annually on marketing, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The review is being lead by Chris Capossela, who took over
as the company&#8217;s chief marketing officer last year, according to
the people. Capossela is working with senior marketing
executives for each of Microsoft&#8217;s business groups, such as
Yusuf Mehdi from the Xbox unit and Tami Reller from Windows, one
of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving People Around &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes may include shifting some of the more technical
marketing workers to engineering groups, cutting employees who
don&#8217;t have needed skills or whose work is duplicated by other
workers, and revamping how marketing groups are organized and
where they fit into the rest of the company, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Wootton, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft spent $13.9 billion on sales and marketing in
fiscal 2011, which ended on June 30, up 5.5 percent from the
previous year. Microsoft said then that it had 25,000 workers
devoted to those tasks, without breaking out how many are
focused on marketing. The company had about 90,000 full-time
employees in total. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer-focused technology companies like Apple are making
inroads in the business world, forcing the information-
technology industry to regroup. Apple will sell $10 billion
worth of iPads and $9 billion of Mac computers to corporate
customers this year, a 58 percent jump, Forrester Research Inc. (FORR)
said in a report last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google announced a deal earlier today to supply e-mail and
business services to the Spanish bank Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
Argentaria SA, marking the biggest corporate contract for the
Internet-search company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also is facing rising costs because of a shift to
cloud software, which is stored in the company&#8217;s data centers
and delivered over the Internet. Its $8.5 billion purchase of
Skype Technologies SA and Xbox gaming products are increasing
expenses as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft announced its first-ever companywide firings in
January 2009, a move that included more than 5,000 jobs by the
time it concluded. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the U.S.
bank that gets more than 60 percent of its revenue from trading,
named James R. Paradise and Eiji Ueda co-heads of the firm&#8217;s
securities division in Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paradise, who is based in London, and Ueda, who works in
Tokyo, will move to Hong Kong to assume their new
responsibilities, according to an internal memo obtained by
Bloomberg News. They will report to Katsunori Sago, deputy
president of Goldman Sachs Japan, and to David C. Ryan,
president of Goldman Sachs Asia Pacific Ex-Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paradise and Ueda are assuming some of the responsibilities
previously held by Yusuf Alireza, who left Goldman Sachs in
November after 19 years at the company. Alireza, who oversaw the
securities division in Asia, was promoted a year ago to be co-
president of the Asia-Pacific region outside Japan with Ryan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s securities division, which handles sales
and trading of equities, fixed-income, currencies and
commodities, has been managed globally since 2008 by David B. Heller, Edward K. Eisler, Pablo J. Salame, and Harvey M. Schwartz. The company generated $14.2 billion in revenue from
its institutional client sales and trading business in the first
nine months of 2011, down 22 percent from a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paradise, 47, has been co-head of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s global
securities services, futures and execution business since 2008,
according to the memo. A British citizen, he joined the firm in
1989, was promoted to managing director in 2000 and became a
partner in 2004. In his new role he will be a member of the Asia
Pacific Management Committee as well as co-chair, with Ueda, of
the Securities Division Asia Pacific Operating Committee,
according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ueda&#8217;s Committee Memberships &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ueda, a Japanese citizen who joined Goldman Sachs in 1991
and has been a partner since 2002, has been co-head of fixed-
income, currencies and commodities in Japan since 2009,
according to the memo. He is co-chair of the Asia Pacific Risk
Committee and is a member of the Asia Pacific Management
Committee, Securities Division Asia Pacific Operating Committee,
Korea Operating Committee and Firmwide Risk Committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman in New York,
confirmed the contents of the memo, which was signed by Heller,
Eisler, Salame and Schwartz. Reuters reported Paradise and
Ueda&#8217;s new assignments earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s biggest
software company, sued Shanghai Gome Electrical Appliances Co.
in China, alleging the retailer had offered computers with
pirated versions of its Windows and Office programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit against Gome was filed at the Shanghai Huangpu
District People&#8217;s Court, the Redmond, Washington-based company
said in an e-mailed statement dated Jan. 6. Separately,
Microsoft sued Clevo Co. (2362)&#8217;s Buynow retail unit at a court in
Beijing, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is boosting efforts to counter unauthorized use
of its software in China, which surpassed the U.S. last year as
the world&#8217;s biggest market for personal computers. About 78
percent of software in China was pirated in 2010, according to
estimates by the Business Software Alliance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two computer vendors with stores in a Buynow mall in
Beijing were offering products with pirated Microsoft software,
the U.S. company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philip Cheung, an investor relations manager at Hong Kong-
listed Gome Electrical Appliances Holdings Ltd. (493), couldn&#8217;t

privately owned by founder Huang Guangyu. He declined to comment
on the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buynow has measures to curb intellectual property
infringement by vendors at its malls, and &#8220;regrets&#8221; the legal
action by Microsoft, Buynow said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong

government relaxes monetary policies, according to Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) of so-called H shares
may reach 12,200 by Dec. 31, compared with yesterday&#8217;s close of
10,413.61, Helen Zhu, a Goldman Sachs strategist, said in a
Bloomberg Television interview today. The gauge advanced 0.8
percent to 10,500.34 as of 3:17 p.m. local time. Hong Kong&#8217;s
benchmark Hang Seng Index (HSI) may reach 22,000, Zhu said. The gauge
settled yesterday at 19,004.28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The H-share index has risen 5.6 percent this year, while
the Shanghai Composite Index advanced 3.5 percent after a
weekend central bank report showed new bank lending and money
supply exceeded economist estimates in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data prompted investors to think that &#8220;the government
may have moved very preemptively,&#8221; Zhu said. China may reduce
the amount banks have to keep in reserve in the first half of
the year and any cut in interest rates would likely happen in
the second half, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The People&#8217;s Bank of China cut banks&#8217; reserve-requirement
ratios from a record high for the first time in three years on
Nov. 30. Expectations for more monetary easing escalated after
inflation cooled to the slowest pace in 14 months in November
and industrial output growth weakened. Import growth fell to a
two-year low in December, data yesterday showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CLSA Cautious &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai and H-share indexes tumbled 22 percent last
year after the PBOC raised interest rates and reserve
requirement ratios to combat rising prices. Data due tomorrow
may show inflation slowed to 4 percent in December, the lowest
level since September 2010, according to the median estimate in
a Bloomberg economist survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets has turned cautious on China&#8217;s
stocks because of &#8220;downside risk&#8221; to the economy from slumping
property prices. The CSI 300 Index may rise to 2,600 in the
first half of this year while earnings growth may slow to 5
percent compared with the consensus estimate of 19 percent,
Manop Sangiambut, CLSA&#8217;s head of China A-share research, said in
a report dated yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank may undertake &#8220;reactive&#8221; policy
loosening rather than &#8220;proactive,&#8221; he said. The CSI 300 index (SHSZ300),
the 300 most valuable companies trading in the Shanghai and
Shenzhen exchanges, retreated 0.5 percent today to 2,435.61. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New bank lending totaled 640.5 billion yuan ($101 billion)
in December, according to a statement posted on the PBOC&#8217;s
website on Jan. 8. The amount exceeded the 575 billion yuan
median estimate of 18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. M2, a
measure of money supply, rose 13.6 percent, compared with the
12.9 percent median of 18 estimates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evergreen Capital Partners Ltd.&#8217;s
Australian hedge fund, which gained 58 percent in its first 18
months by buying resource stocks and short-selling retailers,
will close to outside investors in six to 12 months to remain
focused on its investments, co-founder Tim Hannon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evergreen&#8217;s long-short equities fund will stop accepting
new money when it reaches A$200 million ($206 million) from its
current A$100 million, Hannon, a former Goldman Sachs JBWere
Ltd. asset manager, said in a telephone interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to manage a lot more money; our size is one
of our chief competitive advantages,&#8221; Hannon, 39, said. &#8220;I&#8217;m
not doing any more marketing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melbourne-based Evergreen was the best performer among 157
Australian hedge funds over the past year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. While most of the industry&#8217;s funds
stagnated or shrank amid 2011&#8217;s market turmoil, Hannon made
money by betting against Australian retailers such as Harvey
Norman Holdings Ltd. (HVN) and David Jones Ltd. (DJS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evergreen, which aims to deliver a return after fees of 15
percent per year, advanced in all but two of its first 18 months
through to the end of November, company reports show. The
benchmark SP/ASX 200 index fell 13.2 percent in the first 11
months of last year, while the fund added 19.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These guys have put Australia on the map,&#8221; said Damien Hatfield, director at Triple A Partners Australia, a Sydney-
based hedge-fund adviser. The global &#8220;hedge-fund industry is
down about 5 percent for 2011 and a strong positive returner
like Evergreen is attracting attention. As they gather assets
under management they have to pump out consistent returns to
maintain that boost.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tough Climate &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund -- founded by Hannon and Chief Operating Officer
Jo Rylance -- began trading in May 2010 as the first round of
Europe&#8217;s sovereign debt crisis roiled global stock, currency and
bond markets. Hannon and his team of five, which includes former
Goldman Sachs JBWere analyst David Tay and ex-Goldman Sachs
Asset Management Executive Director Andrew Smith, use short
sales that involve selling borrowed shares and buying them back
later to make money from stocks they expect to fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund remains &#8220;extremely bearish&#8221; on so-called
&#8220;retail landlords,&#8221; including David Jones, Australia&#8217;s second-
largest department store chain, and its larger rival Myer
Holdings Ltd. (MYR), he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 26-member Australian SP/ASX 200 Consumer Discretionary
Index tumbled 20 percent in the past year as Europe&#8217;s debt
crisis and the developed world&#8217;s highest central bank borrowing
costs prompted consumers to slash spending and increase savings
close to the highest pace in a quarter century. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resource Bets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think there&#8217;s a structural change which needs to
occur&#8221; among retailers, which &#8220;have been in a protected
industry for decades,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evergreen, whose investors include wealthy families, has
increased bets on potential gains by resource companies
including Beach Energy Ltd. (BPT), Drillsearch Energy Ltd. (DLS) and Senex
Energy Ltd (SXY)., he said. The trio search for shale gas in
Australia&#8217;s Cooper Basin, an outback region straddling the
Queensland state and South Australia state border. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If larger energy companies such as Origin Energy Ltd. (ORG) find
themselves short of gas for their LNG plans &#8220;you might see some
acquisition activity in that area,&#8221; Hannon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beach Energy rose 1.5 percent in Sydney trading today.
Senex advanced 2 percent to the highest since March 2000, while
Drillsearch slipped 3.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evergreen says it hasn&#8217;t been hurt by being domiciled far
from traditional hedge fund centers such as London and New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We hear this a lot but that&#8217;s certainly not our
experience,&#8221; said Hannon. &#8220;You really can manage as much
capital as you want. We&#8217;re getting inundated with calls from
funds-of-funds and family offices,&#8221; including from Asia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tax-free bond program that
provided below-market financing to build Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS)&#8217;s headquarters is expiring while New York developers say
the city&#8217;s commercial real estate market still needs support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress created the Liberty Bond program in March 2002
with $8 billion in tax-exempt funds to rebuild lower Manhattan
after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The allocation ran out
last month, and the tax exemption ended on Dec. 31 along with
dozens of other breaks for manufacturers, energy companies and
transit commuters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics that include affordable housing advocates say the
bonds were little more than a subsidy for fancy Manhattan
apartments and office towers for Goldman Sachs and Bank of
America Corp. Developers counter that, more than a decade after
the attacks, low-cost financing remains necessary to help lower
Manhattan&#8217;s commercial market recover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Liberty Bonds made available to the World Trade
Center site are only enough to support rebuilding a little less
than 60 percent of the office space lost on 9/11,&#8221; Larry Silverstein, the World Trade Center&#8217;s developer, said in an e-
mail. &#8220;In an ideal world, more such resources would be made
available to help jump-start construction of the remaining 40
percent of the office space that was destroyed by terrorists.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon shuffled part of his management team and
recombined oversight of retail units that was split last year at
the biggest U.S. bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon promoted Doug Petno to run commercial banking and
moved Chief Risk Officer Barry Zubrow to head regulatory, public
relations and lobbying strategy, Dimon wrote today in an
internal memo obtained by Bloomberg News. Joe Evangelisti, a
spokesman for the New York-based bank, confirmed the memo&#8217;s
contents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Hogan, who was managing risk at JPMorgan&#8217;s investment
bank, will succeed Zubrow in overseeing risk companywide,
according to the memo. Hogan also joined the firm&#8217;s 14-member
operating committee, reporting directly to Dimon, 55. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jay Mandelbaum, who ran strategy and business development,
is leaving the firm to &#8220;focus on entrepreneurial and other
interests,&#8221; Dimon wrote. &#8220;Jay has been an excellent partner of
mine since 1992, and I will miss him tremendously.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Todd Maclin, head of retail banking, and Gordon Smith, who
runs the credit-card division, now are co-CEOs of consumer
finance, according to the memo. In June, Dimon separated
management of the retail bank into three divisions -- mortgage,
retail banking and credit cards -- when the previous CEO of all
three units, Charlie Scharf, was reassigned to the private-
equity unit as a partner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It has become clear to our leadership that we should run
the Chase consumer business as one business and one brand, one
that focuses first and foremost on serving our customers in the
way they want and with the products they need,&#8221; Dimon wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frank Bisignano, who was appointed in February to oversee
the company&#8217;s mortgage division, will continue in that role,
according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dow Jones Newswires reported on the memo earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), Statoil ASA (STL) and
Repsol YPF SA (REP) agreed to jointly drill oil exploration wells off
Canada&#8217;s Arctic and Atlantic coasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Canadian division of San Ramon, California-based
Chevron will work with Stavanger, Norway-based Statoil and
Madrid-based Repsol to explore for oil in the Orphan Basin off
the coast of Newfoundland, with Chevron controlling 65 percent
of the project, the U.S. oil and gas producer said today in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies will also cooperate on drilling wells in the
Flemish Pass Basin, while Chevron and Statoil will cooperate in
the Beaufort Sea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newfoundland holds more than a quarter of Canada&#8217;s
conventional oil reserves, according to the website of the
government of Newfoundland. Offshore oil production has made the
province the fastest-growing economy in Canada, according to the
U.S. Geological Survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Arctic, including parts controlled by Canada,
companies are eyeing oil reserves that may be as large as 90
billion barrels, the U.S. Geological Survey said in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Strengthening our position in the Flemish Pass Basin and
obtaining early entrance to the Orphan Basin and Beaufort Sea
provides us access to large potential resources,&#8221; said Statoil
Vice President Tim Dodson in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Dawn Kopecki and Dakin Campbell" date="Jan 12, 2012  7:57 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-12/jpmorgan-may-report-record-earnings-as-wells-fargo-closes-gap.html"><headline>JPMorgan May Report Record Profit</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), likely to
keep the title of most profitable U.S. bank when it reports
earnings tomorrow, has a West Coast rival closing in: Wells
Fargo  Co. (WFC) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is projected to report a record $18.5 billion in
2011 earnings when adjusted for one-time items, a 6 percent
increase for the New York-based company, according to a survey
of analysts by Bloomberg. Profit at San Francisco-based Wells
Fargo is estimated to have jumped more than four times as much,
to an all-time high of $15.3 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By focusing on the U.S. and eschewing traditional Wall
Street businesses such as structured products, Wells Fargo
surpassed earnings at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Citigroup
Inc. for six consecutive quarters. Wells Fargo, whose $1.3
trillion in assets make it the fourth-largest U.S. bank, also
has higher valuations than its bigger peers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo &#8220;never really embraced investment banking as
heavily as the Wall Street crowd has,&#8221; said Paul Miller, a
former examiner for the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and
analyst at FBR Capital Markets in Arlington, Virginia. &#8220;I think
one of the reasons Wells is where they are right now is because
they did not get into that business&#8221; in a bigger way, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strains on investment banking will be apparent in
JPMorgan&#8217;s fourth-quarter profit, as well as weak trading
results predicted for its smaller competitors when they report
earnings next week, Miller said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings Ratio &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo is being rewarded for its restraint with a
market value of $156.2 billion, compared with $139.3 billion at
JPMorgan and $91.4 billion at No. 3 Citigroup. (C) Only Goldman
Sachs trades at a higher price-to-earnings ratio than Wells
Fargo among the biggest U.S. lenders, at 10.76 versus 10.25. The
higher the ratio, the faster investors think the company&#8217;s
profit will grow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Traditional banking, predominantly making loans and
taking deposits and serving both corporate and individual
consumers, is being viewed more favorably right now by the
investor community,&#8221; said Ed Najarian, who runs bank research
at International Strategy and Investment Group in New York.
&#8220;It&#8217;s considered safer and to have a steadier and more
consistent earnings outlook.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Share Performance &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo has dropped 7.5 percent in New York trading in
the past 12 months, compared with declines of 18 percent for
JPMorgan and 54 percent for Bank of America Corp. (BAC) Wells Fargo
rose to $30 at 7:37 a.m. in New York from $29.62 yesterday,
while JPMorgan climbed to $37.13 from $36.66. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo, which reports earnings on Jan. 17, owes its
relative good fortune partly to Europe&#8217;s sovereign debt crisis,
which slammed investment-banking results in the second half of
last year at JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and other firms with large
trading desks and international divisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, will probably
report a 23 percent slump in fourth-quarter adjusted profit from
the same period in 2010 to $3.74 billion, or 90 cents a share,
according to the survey. Analysts lowered their estimates after
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 55, said at a Dec. 7
investor conference that trading would be &#8220;essentially flat&#8221;
from the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banking Units &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue at the company&#8217;s investment-banking unit slid this
year from $8.2 billion in the first quarter to about $4.5
billion in the third after backing out a $1.9 billion one-time
accounting gain as concern mounted that Greece would default and
U.S. lawmakers would fail to raise the debt ceiling. JPMorgan
told investors in October that the division would face similar
market conditions for the rest of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading results got a lift in the third quarter as the
price of bank debt fell, resulting in a so-called debt-valuation
adjustment that boosted profits for JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and
Citigroup. The accounting adjustment probably hurt banks in the
fourth quarter as price of their debt rose, resulting in the
opposite effect on earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Trading and investment-banking revenue has been weak and
volatile, especially over the last two quarters, but really the
last two years,&#8221; Najarian said. Investment-banking results will
be worse for the fourth quarter than in the third quarter, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue Declines &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall revenue at JPMorgan is expected to drop 13 percent
for the quarter and 4 percent for the year, to $98.9 billion.
Fixed-income trading revenue at U.S. banks may fall 12 percent
from the third quarter, minus accounting adjustments, while
equities revenue drop 10 percent and investment-bank revenue
remains unchanged, David Trone, an analyst at JMP Securities,
wrote in a Dec. 16 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets showed little improvement in the fourth quarter, as
trading remained subdued, corporate and institutional clients
stayed out of the markets and the holidays slowed deal and
trading traffic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders will continue to face pressure from persistently
low interest rates, which have compressed profit margins on
lending. They&#8217;ll also have to contend with new restrictions on
fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called Durbin amendment, which limits what lenders
can charge merchants on debit transactions, took effect on Oct.
1, affecting almost all U.S. banks and costing the top 25 about
$1.5 billion, according to Jason Goldberg, a senior bank analyst
at Barclays Capital in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoiding &#8216;Trash&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo &#8220;avoided a lot of the trash that others kind
of fell into leading into the 2008 financial crisis,&#8221; Goldberg
said in an interview. The company, led by CEO John Stumpf, 58,
will see its fee revenue fall by about $350 million and JPMorgan
will lose roughly $300 million, Goldberg estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The big issue for the banks is, is this a cyclical or a
secular problem? And the answer is, it&#8217;s both,&#8221; said Richard Bove, an analyst at Rochdale Securities LLC in Lutz, Florida.
Bove said U.S. lenders are starting to perform more like
utilities with smaller growth rates and less leverage. Goldman
Sachs may never generate 10 percent or 12 percent growth rates
again, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not going to happen because the leverage in the
balance sheet is gone, the off-balance-sheet conduits are
illegal, the variable-interest entities are limited, the
structured-investment vehicles are gone,&#8221; Bove said, referring
to the types of securities that helped trigger the U.S. economic
crisis. &#8220;The leverage isn&#8217;t there and the market isn&#8217;t there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optimistic Outlook &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large super-regional banks such as Wells Fargo and
Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial Services Group Inc. will probably
fare better as the basic business of taking deposits and making
loans gives reason for optimism, Goldberg said. Lending at U.S.
banks was up 2.1 percent from the third to the fourth quarter
while deposits rose 5.6 percent, according to Federal Reserve
data. Goldberg said the growth offset slimmer profit margins in
the fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In this quarter you&#8217;re going to see dramatically
different results in each segment, with the traditional banks
having the best performance and the capital markets having the
worst,&#8221; Bove said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike Mayo, an analyst with independent research firm CLSA
in New York, said U.S. banks are in the middle of the industry&#8217;s
worst two years of revenue growth since the Great Depression.
Earnings for the fourth quarter will be weak and won&#8217;t see much
improvement this year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday the 13th &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Friday the 13th will live up to its name when it comes to
bank earnings,&#8221; Mayo said in an interview yesterday at
Bloomberg&#8217;s headquarters in New York promoting his new book,
&#8220;Exile on Wall Street.&#8221; When banks start reporting results
with JPMorgan tomorrow, &#8220;you&#8217;re going to see all sorts of
revenue and margin pressure and the results will be
underwhelming.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, second by assets to JPMorgan, will
probably post $5.84 billion in adjusted earnings for the year, a
63 percent plunge from 2010, according to the Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup&#8217;s 2011 profit was estimated at $11.8 billion, or
13 percent higher than the previous year, and Goldman Sachs is
projected to report a 57 percent decline to $3.35 billion.
Morgan Stanley (MS), the sixth-largest U.S. bank, may post $2.23
billion of adjusted earnings, down 28 percent. All three
companies are based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manby will become an advisory director to the firm, the New

Telekom AG and Vodafone Group Plc (VOD), the firm said in the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was the top ranked adviser for technology,

followed by Bank of America Corp. and Barclays Capital,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

region governments braced for credit downgrades by SP and after
JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s profit slumped 23 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the market close, SP said France was downgraded,
while Germany had its credit rating affirmed. All 10 groups in
the SP 500 fell as financial, industrial and technology
measures declined at least 0.7 percent. JPMorgan, the largest
U.S. bank by assets, dropped 2.5 percent. Bank of America Corp. (BAC),
Intel Corp. (INTC) and Alcoa Inc. (AA) lost more than 1.3 percent. Eastman
Kodak Co. (EK) tumbled 23 percent as it is said to be in talks with
Citigroup Inc. (C) to provide bankruptcy financing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 slid 0.5 percent to 1,289.09 as of 4 p.m. New
York time, paring a drop of as much as 1.4 percent. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average slid 48.96 points, or 0.4 percent, to
12,422.06. The market will be closed on Jan. 16 for a holiday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People are keeping a very careful eye on Europe and they
are nervous with earnings,&#8221; Mark Bronzo, who helps manage $23.4
billion at Security Global Investors in Irvington, New York,
said in a telephone interview. &#8220;Most people expected France to
be downgraded. It&#8217;s critical that any downgrades in Europe do
not involve Germany,&#8221; he said. In the U.S., &#8220;JPMorgan (JPM)&#8217;s
earnings were OK, but the quality is not good.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany, Belgium, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Luxembourg and
the Netherlands had their ratings affirmed by SP as France lost
its AAA rating. France was cut to AA+ and the rating has a
negative outlook, SP said in a statement. Cyprus, Italy,
Portugal and Spain were cut by two notches SP said. The long-
term ratings on Austria, Malta, Slovakia and Slovenia were cut
one notch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Size and Scope&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European leaders&#8217; attempts to address economic woes hasn&#8217;t
&#8220;produced a breakthrough of sufficient size and scope to fully
address the Eurozone&#8217;s financial problems,&#8221; SP said. The
region continues to face tightening credit conditions among
other problems, SP said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concern about potential downgrades overshadowed data
showing that confidence among U.S. consumers rose more than
forecast in January to the highest level in eight months, a sign
household spending may hold up early this year. Separate figures
showed that the U.S. trade deficit widened more than forecast in
November as American exports declined and companies stepped up
imports of crude oil and automobiles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 rose 0.9 percent since Jan. 6, capping the
second straight week of gains, amid lower borrowing costs at
auctions in Europe. Investors also watched fourth-quarter
results. SP 500 companies, which beat estimates in the previous
11 quarters, are forecast to report a 4.6 percent increase in
per-share profit during the September-December period, according
to projections compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Sidelines &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial companies slumped 0.8 percent, the most among 10
groups in the SP 500. JPMorgan dropped 2.5 percent to $35.92.
Investment-banking revenue declined 30 percent to $4.36 billion
from a year earlier as many clients stayed on the sidelines on
concern the European debt crisis would lead to a global economic
slowdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Financials would have to participate for the market to do
well,&#8221; James Dunigan, who helps oversee $104 billion as chief
investment officer in Philadelphia for PNC Wealth Management,
said in a telephone interview. &#8220;We&#8217;ll look to see whether all
that disruption in Europe had an effect in overall earnings
reports. If that bleeds over into our export numbers, it may
have an impact on the earnings side.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks Tumble &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America lost 2.7 percent to $6.61, while Morgan
Stanley (MS) retreated 3.2 percent to $16.63. Citigroup fell 2.7
percent to $30.74. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. slid 2.2 percent to
$98.96. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index retreated 1.1 percent
amid concern about global economic growth. The Dow Jones
Transportation Average dropped 0.6 percent. Intel, the world&#8217;s
biggest chipmaker, declined 2.4 percent to $25.14. Alcoa slumped
1.3 percent to $9.80. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kodak tumbled 23 percent to 52 cents. The imaging company
may seek protection from creditors within weeks and then hold an
auction to sell its patent portfolio, said three people familiar
with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the
talks are private. Kodak may seek about $1 billion in so-called
debtor-in-possession financing, though terms may change, two
people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weaker Coal Market &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patriot Coal Corp. (PCX) declined 13 percent to $7.87. The U.S.
mining company said it will idle production in West Virginia
because of a weaker market for coal used by steelmakers. Other
coal producers fell. Alpha Natural Resources Inc. dropped 10
percent, the most in the SP 500, to $20.19. Arch Coal Inc. (ACI)
retreated 9.8 percent to $14.13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW) lost 2.5 percent to $12.16. The
independent, San Francisco-based brokerage was downgraded to
&#8220;market perform&#8221; from &#8220;outperform&#8221; at Wells Fargo  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BankUnited Inc (BKU). rallied 5.8 percent to $24.48 as it is
exploring a sale one year after its private-equity owners took
the lender public, according to a person with knowledge of the
matter. BankUnited is working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS),
said the person, who declined to be identified because the
discussions are private. The company could still decide against
a sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock investors shouldn&#8217;t get used to the relative calm
that markets are now showing, according to Andrew Garthwaite, a
global equity strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Abnormally Sensitive&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volatility is likely to rise this year, Garthwaite wrote
yesterday in a report. He attributed the outlook to excessive
borrowing in developed economies, which ensures that investors
will be &#8220;abnormally sensitive&#8221; to shifts in economic growth
and government policy, he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sentiment in the market has clearly changed over the past
three months,&#8221; wrote Garthwaite, who is based in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, developed-country debt is still $8 trillion too
high, the report said. Garthwaite came up with that estimate by
comparing the borrowing relative to gross domestic product with
a figure based on the debt-to-GDP ratio&#8217;s trend during the past
three decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need to reduce this burden creates &#8220;a considerable
amount of tail risk,&#8221; or potential for unlikely stock-market
outcomes, the report said. He mentioned 11 possible surprises
for this year. One was a breakup of the euro region, which he
estimated would send the SP 500 falling to 800, or 38 percent
less than yesterday&#8217;s close. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Dawn Kopecki" date="Jan 13, 2012  4:16 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-13/jpmorgan-profit-falls-13-on-weak-trading-matches-estimates.html"><headline>JPMorgan Shares Drop as Stock, Bond Trading Revenue Declines</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. fell the most
in almost a month in New York trading after the bank reported a
23 percent drop in profit on lower investment-banking fees and
revenue (JPM) from trading stocks and bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, dropped 2.5
percent to $35.92 at 4:15 p.m., the steepest decline since Dec.
19. The company said fourth-quarter net income slid to $3.73
billion, or 90 cents a share, from $4.83 billion, or $1.12, in
the same period a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue in every investment-banking business fell from a
year earlier, including an 18 percent drop in trading. The
division&#8217;s total revenue declined 30 percent to $4.36 billion as
corporate clients stayed on the sidelines on concern Europe&#8217;s
debt crisis would lead to an economic slowdown. Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon said the investment-banking business is
&#8220;naturally volatile&#8221; and would eventually bounce back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that these numbers are permanent,&#8221; Dimon,
55, said on a conference call with journalists after earnings
were released. &#8220;When things come back these numbers will boom
again and we&#8217;ll be geniuses, and it won&#8217;t be because we did
anything, it will be because we stayed in the game.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s drop was the third-biggest on the KBW Bank Index (BKX)
of 24 companies, after 2.7 percent declines at both Citigroup
Inc. (C) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Job Cuts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial institutions are eliminating jobs to compensate
for falling trading revenue, disclosing plans to reduce staff by
more than 200,000 worldwide, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Britain&#8217;s biggest
government-owned bank, said this week it would cut about 4,800. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the year, JPMorgan&#8217;s net income was a record $19
billion, 9 percent higher than in 2010. Revenue for 2011
declined 5 percent to $97.2 billion, and fourth-quarter revenue
fell 18 percent, to $21.5 billion, the lowest in three years and
below the $22.6 billion estimated by analysts in the Bloomberg
survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe these returns were reasonable given the
environment, although the return for the fourth quarter was
modestly disappointing,&#8221; Dimon said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed-income and equity-markets revenue dropped to $3.27
billion from $4 billion a year earlier and $4.75 billion in the
third quarter, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retail banking earned $533 million, down 54 percent from
the third quarter and up 16 percent from a year earlier. The
division benefited from a reduction in loss provisions to $779
million from $2.42 billion in the prior year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Cards &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fewer consumers fell behind on credit-card payments in the
fourth quarter compared with the same period in 2010. Loans at
least 30 days overdue, a signal of future write-offs, fell to
1.13 percent from 1.22 percent. Write-offs dropped to 4.29
percent from 7.85 percent the prior year and 4.7 percent in the
previous quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called Durbin amendment, which limits what lenders
can charge merchants on debit transactions, took effect on Oct.
1, affecting almost all U.S. banks and costing the top 25 about
$1.5 billion, Jason Goldberg, a senior bank analyst at Barclays
Capital in New York, said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said today the new rules will reduce its net
income by about $600 million a year, and Dimon said on the call
that the Durbin amendment was a &#8220;gross miscarriage of
justice.&#8221; Chief Financial Officer Douglas Braunstein said the
Durbin amendment reduced revenue $350 million in the fourth
quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mortgage Buybacks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Losses from buying back mortgages JPMorgan previously sold
may amount to about $350 million per quarter this year, the bank
forecast today. Quarterly repurchase losses averaged $337
million last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s net income continued to benefit from releasing
back into earnings reserves previously set aside for bad
mortgages, credit cards and other loans, although it was smaller
than in previous periods. The bank released $723 million in
reserves in the fourth quarter, compared with $2.1 billion a
year earlier. The bank added $4.66 billion in net income through
reserve releases for the year, compared with $7 billion in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company continued to build its litigation reserves,
setting aside $528 million more for mortgage-related lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which has benefited from record low costs of
funding mortgages and other assets, faces a squeeze on its net
interest margin -- the difference between what it pays to borrow
money and what it gets for loans and on securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s margin narrowed to 2.7 percent from 2.88 percent
a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower Taxes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was able to boost profit last quarter by paying
less in taxes. The company&#8217;s effective tax rate was 21 percent
in the fourth quarter, compared with 31 percent a year earlier
and 27 percent in the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower tax rate contributed about 10 cents to JPMorgan&#8217;s
per-share earnings, helping it to meet or beat some analysts&#8217;
estimates, Keith Horowitz of Citigroup Investment Research, said
in a note to clients today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldberg at Barclays Capital said the fourth quarter was
probably the worst earnings period for the industry during 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A lot of it is driven by the challenging capital markets
environment,&#8221; he said in a Jan. 9 interview. &#8220;Trading revenues
started out the year off strong, and then the second half of the
year was quite challenged. That business bounces around.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. banks are in the middle of the industry&#8217;s worst two
years of revenue growth since the Great Depression, according to
Mike Mayo, an analyst with independent research firm CLSA in New
York. Earnings across the industry were weak in the fourth
quarter and won&#8217;t have much improvement this year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank Stocks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowing economic growth, mounting mortgage liabilities and
heightened concern that Europe&#8217;s debt crisis will spread have
weighed on bank stocks all year. Just two of the 24 companies in
the KBW Bank Index posted a gain in 2011, and the worst
performer, Bank of America, was down 58 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large super-regional banks such as Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) and
Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial Services Group Inc. will probably
fare better as the basic business of taking deposits and making
loans gives reason for optimism, Goldberg said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, second by assets to JPMorgan, will
probably post $5.82 billion in adjusted earnings for the year
when the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company reports next
week, according to the Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup&#8217;s 2011 profit was estimated at $11.6 billion, or
12 percent higher than the previous year, and Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) is projected to report a 62 percent decline to $2.95
billion, the Bloomberg survey shows. Morgan Stanley, the sixth-
largest U.S. bank, may post $2.22 billion of adjusted earnings,
down 29 percent. All three companies are based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Jeffrey McCracken, Jacqueline Simmons and Drew Armstrong" date="Jan 13, 2012  4:11 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-13/nestle-said-to-vie-with-danone-in-bids-to-acquire-pfizer-s-baby-food-unit.html"><headline>Nestle Said to Vie With Danone to Buy Pfizer&#8217;s Baby-Food Unit</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Nestle SA (NESN) and Danone SA (BN) made first-
round bids for Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s baby-formula unit, putting two of
Europe&#8217;s largest food companies in competition for the division,
people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tax-free spinoff is still an option for the company, said
the people, who declined to be identified as the process is
private. Pfizer had delayed sending out sale documents to
examine whether that move would be better for investors, people
with knowledge of the plans said in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestle had $8.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments as of June, more than twice as much as
Danone&#8217;s $3 billion. The sale of the infant-nutrition business,
whose revenue approached $2 billion in 2010, would allow Chief
Executive Officer Ian Read to focus more on medicine development
at Pfizer, whose drugs include the Lipitor cholesterol pill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to their cash, the companies&#8217; investment-grade
credit ratings may help them borrow funds for acquisitions. A
representative for Vevey, Switzerland-based Nestle declined to
comment, while two spokeswomen for Danone didn&#8217;t respond to
requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many drugmakers are seeking fresh sources of revenue as
their patents on top-selling drugs expire, allowing copycats to
enter the market with cheaper generic versions. Through 2015,
medicines that generate $171 billion in sales globally will lose
patent protection, according to  Gary Gatyas, a spokesman for
IMS Health in Parsippany, New Jersey, which tracks the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipitor Loss &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer lost exclusivity on its Lipitor (PHAM1150) treatment in the
U.S. last year. The company&#8217;s plan to shed its nutrition and
animal health units is part of Read&#8217;s strategy to shield against
the potential loss of more than $10 billion in sales from the
cholesterol pill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The process of exploring strategic alternatives for
Pfizer&#8217;s nutrition business is ongoing,&#8221; said Joan Campion, a
spokeswoman for Pfizer. &#8220;We&#8217;re currently pursuing the
activities associated with evaluating all options, including
sale, spinoff or other transaction.&#8221; The company expects to
announce a decision this year, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares fell less than 1 percent to $21.84 at the
close in New York. Danone declined 1.1 percent to 47.05 euros in
Paris, while Nestle slid 0.5 percent to 53.20 Swiss francs in
Zurich. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examining Options &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said in July that it would examine options for the
operations, as well as the animal-health division. The New York-
based drugmaker may fetch as much as $10.5 billion for the baby-
food unit, the people said in July. Together, the two accounted
for 8 percent of the drugmaker&#8217;s 2010 revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors will view this positively,&#8221; said Les Funtleyder, a health-care strategist and portfolio manager with
Miller Tabak  Co. in New York, whose fund owns Pfizer shares.
&#8220;The more capital return, the better,&#8221; he said of a potential
sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares gained less than 1 percent to $21.99
yesterday. They have risen 20 percent in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbott Laboratories (ABT) said this week that it isn&#8217;t
participating in the Pfizer process. The health-care company was
among the parties that had expressed interest in the division,
people with knowledge of the process said in July. The Abbott
Park, Illinois-based company, which announced its own breakup in
October, was still interested in bidding for the Pfizer unit
then, said a person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antitrust Concern? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potential buyers, notably Nestle, may encounter antitrust
issues in some markets, two of the people said. With the Pfizer
operations, the Swiss food company would hold more than 60
percent of the market for baby formula in Australia, Mexico and
elsewhere, they said. Danone would have as much as 80 percent of
markets such as the U.K., Turkey and New Zealand and more than
70 percent in Ireland and Australia, said the people. Both
companies could dispose of assets to meet antitrust
requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer gained the formula division through its $68 billion
purchase of Wyeth in 2009. The unit, which makes the SMA Gold
line of products for infants and children and Enercal
supplements for adults, offers products in more than 60
countries, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nutrition business is ranked fifth worldwide by market
share, according to Lee Linthicum, an analyst with Euromonitor
International in London. That compares with the Middle East and
Africa, and Asia, where it holds the No. 3 and No. 4 spots,
respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Sapna Maheshwari" date="Jan 13, 2012  3:46 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-13/jpmorgan-plans-bond-sale-as-relative-yields-on-bank-debt-fall.html"><headline>JPMorgan Sells $3 Billion of Debt as Bank Debt Yields Tumble</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the largest
U.S. bank by assets, sold $3 billion of bonds in its biggest
debt sale in almost a year as relative yields on bank debt fall
to an eight-week low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which said today fourth-quarter profit fell 23
percent amid declines in trading revenue and investment-banking
fees, sold 4.5 percent, 10-year notes, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. (JPM) The New York-based bank&#8217;s securities
yield 270 basis points, or 2.7 percentage points, above similar-
maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which sold almost $24 billion of bonds last year,
got the lowest interest rate since 2005 on a sale of 30-year
bonds by a bank in December, Bloomberg data show. The extra
yield investors demand to own U.S. dollar-denominated bank debt
instead of Treasuries fell to 364 basis points yesterday, the
lowest since Nov. 18, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data. That compares with average spreads of 260 basis
points on JPMorgan&#8217;s debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a hard name not to like from a credit
perspective, especially considering similarly rated names such
as Wells Fargo&#8221; trade almost 100 basis points within JPMorgan
debt, Morningstar Inc. analyst James Leonard wrote in a note
today. &#8220;Assuming investors can still buy the JPM name and are
not filled up because of diversification constraints, this new
deal is very attractive,&#8221; he wrote, using the company&#8217;s ticker
symbol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous Sale &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offering was the bank&#8217;s biggest sale since February
2011, when it issued $3 billion of five-year notes, Bloomberg
data show. It&#8217;s JPMorgan&#8217;s biggest issue of 10-year notes in the
U.S. since April 2009, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan last sold 10-year notes in October, issuing $1.75
billion of 4.35 percent securities in an add-on to a $1.25
billion offering of the debt in August, Bloomberg data show. The
securities priced at a 225 basis-point spread, Bloomberg data
show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rival Wells Fargo  Co., based in San Francisco, last sold
10-year notes in March, issuing $2.5 billion of 4.6 percent, 10-
year senior unsecured notes at a 130 basis-point spread,
Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said today that net income dropped to $3.73
billion, or 90 cents a share, from $4.83 billion, or $1.12, in
the similar period a year earlier, according to a statement.
Earnings matched the average estimate of 28 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment-Banking Results &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue in every investment-banking business fell from a
year earlier, including an 18 percent drop in trading. The
division&#8217;s total revenue fell 30 percent to $4.36 billion as
corporate clients stayed on the sidelines on concern Europe&#8217;s
debt crisis would lead to an economic slowdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drop was larger than Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon forecast in December, when he said investment-banking
revenue would be &#8220;essentially flat&#8221; from the third quarter&#8217;s
$6.37 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the drop in profit, the company&#8217;s Tier 1 common
ratio using Basel III calculations is estimated at 7.9 percent
from 7 percent last year, Morningstar&#8217;s Leonard wrote in the
note today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mexican stocks followed global equities lower as France was
stripped of its top credit rating by Standard  Poor&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grupo Modelo SA (GMODELOC) , Mexico&#8217;s largest beer maker,

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. approached
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with a bid for a block of
the mortgage bonds assumed from American International Group
Inc. (AIG), prompting the central bank to weigh an auction of the
debt, three people familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank may sell securities held by its Maiden
Lane II vehicle with a face value of about $7 billion, said the
people, who declined to be identified because the deliberations
are private. New York-based Goldman Sachs may have sought the
bonds for itself or clients, they said. Four or five dealers may
be asked to assemble bids this month, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman&#8217;s never been bashful, I call them opportunistic
as a compliment,&#8221; Steven Delaney, an analyst at San Francisco-
based JMP Securities LLC who covers real estate investment
trusts that invest in mortgages, said today on Bloomberg
Television. &#8220;But Goldman&#8217;s not the only major investor that
sees value&#8221; in U.S. home-loan bonds with government backing
after prices slumped, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs (GS), declined to
comment, as did the New York Fed&#8217;s Jack Gutt and Mark Herr of
New York-based AIG. The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday
the potential sale and Goldman Sachs&#8217;s bid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Fed halted in June a plan to sell the Maiden
Lane II assets through a series of auctions after its sales of
about $10 billion roiled markets, dragging down everything from
high-yield corporate bonds to commercial-mortgage securities as
Wall Street dealers sought to reduce risk after building their
inventories. AIG turned over the holdings to the New York Fed in
2008 as part of its rescue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Market Conditions&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank said last year it might resume selling the
bonds &#8220;individually and in segments over time as market
conditions warrant through a competitive sales process.&#8221;
Securities with a face value of $21 billion remained when the
auctions were halted. The Fed valued the Maiden Lane II (FARWML2) holdings
at about $9.1 billion as of this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Values of so-called non-agency mortgage securities fell
further and trading shriveled as Europe&#8217;s debt crisis
intensified after the end of the auctions. Paul Norris, a senior
money manager at Burlington, Vermont-based Dwight Asset
Management Co., said that because the prospect of additional Fed
sales has been weighing on the market, a successful auction
could be positive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &#8220;disaster&#8221; scenario, a Fed sale could disrupt the
market again by creating too much supply, said Norris, whose
firm manages and advises on more than $50 billion of assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The portfolio includes securities backed by the types of
home loans with some of the highest default rates, such as so-
called subprime, Alt-A and option adjustable-rate mortgage debt.
The New York Fed began unloading the bonds piecemeal in April
after rejecting a $15.7 billion bid from AIG for the entire pool
the previous month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adjustable-Rate Mortgages &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rout in the market for the bonds has eased, with typical
prices of top-ranked securities tied to Alt-A ARMs unchanged at
48 cents on the dollar in the month ended Jan. 4, according to
Barclays Capital data. The bonds had plunged from last year&#8217;s
high of 68 cents in February. Alt-A loans fall between prime and
subprime in terms of expected defaults. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Fed auction may help the $1.1 trillion market for non-
agency securities by offering new information on current values,
JMP&#8217;s Delaney said. Trading has been limited in recent months,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the portfolio is sold to an individual investor or group
assembled by dealers in an &#8220;all-or-nothing&#8221; process, that may
obscure bids on specific securities and &#8220;a lack of price
discovery is inherently not good,&#8221; said Adam Murphy, president
of Empirasign Strategies LLC, a New York-based provider of data
on securitization-market trading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Central Bank&#8217;s move to
provide three-year loans to the region&#8217;s banks and accept a
wider variety of collateral has eliminated the risk a bank runs
short of funds for at least the next year, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It eliminates bank liquidity or funding problems for at
least the next year, that&#8217;s a pretty powerful statement,&#8221; Dimon
said today after his company reported a drop in fourth-quarter
net income. &#8220;That was the biggest single risk of an
uncontrollable surprise right there, so if that&#8217;s taken off the
table, that&#8217;s a good thing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ECB President Mario Draghi last month unveiled plans to
offer banks 36-month, 1 percent loans through two so-called
longer-term refinancing operations, known as LTROs. The plan
replaced a 12-month lending facility established by the ECB in
October and also allowed banks to use a wider variety of assets
as collateral for the loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Europe is trying mightily to solve its problems. I still
think the likely outcome is they will muddle through,&#8221; Dimon
said. &#8220;The longer you wait, the higher you run the risk of
something disorderly that you can&#8217;t really control. I think the
ECB took off the worst outcome, i.e. a bank failure.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 46-member Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial Services
Index climbed 2.5 percent in December after slumping 8.3 percent
in November. So far this year, the index is up 0.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks in Europe are still shedding so-called risk-weighted
assets, or RWAs, because regulators are requiring them to
increase their ratios of equity capital to RWAs, Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re still reducing RWA by not rolling things over,
you can see them selling aircraft loans, trade finance, they&#8217;re
not participating as much in revolvers, there are certain
conduits they&#8217;re not doing anymore,&#8221; Dimon said. &#8220;But that&#8217;s
now just to create capital, not because they have a funding
problem.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Corinne Gretler" date="Jan 13, 2012 10:11 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-13/european-stocks-may-drop-10-in-next-three-months-goldman-strategist-says.html"><headline>European Stocks May Slide 10% in Next Three Months, Goldman&#8217;s Moser Says</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;European stocks may drop as much as
10 percent amid concern the region&#8217;s sovereign-debt crisis will
harm the economy, before recovering in the second half of 2012,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stoxx Europe 600 Index might decline to 225 in the next
three months, Gerald Moser, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s London-based equity
strategist, said at the bank&#8217;s Global Strategy conference in
Zurich today. He expects the gauge to recover in the second half
of the year to close at 250 to 270, a gain of as much as 20
percent from the trough. The index fell 0.6 percent to 247.97 at
3:09 p.m. in London today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It will be a difficult year to navigate,&#8221; Moser said.
&#8220;Investors are worried as there is a lot of uncertainty
regarding the short-term outcome of the crisis, but we would
expect equities to move higher on some resolution and a
narrowing of spreads on a sustainable basis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stoxx 600 has advanced 2.5 percent since the beginning
of this year as economic reports around the world exceeded
forecasts and falling bond yields in the euro area eased concern
that the debt crisis is spreading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some resolution, likely driven by an agreement between
France and Germany on how to socialize the debt burden, is
likely in the next couple of months,&#8221; Moser said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs forecast a 10 percent drop in European
profits in 2012, excluding financial companies. Moser said he
wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see analysts&#8217; earnings projections cut
by as much as 30 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valuation Discount &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stoxx 600 trades at 10 times estimated profits, a
discount of 16 percent to its average price-earnings ratio of
11.9 in the past five years, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Equities are an attractive asset class versus bonds,&#8221;
Moser said. &#8220;Although the markets are fairly cheap, valuation
is not everything. We&#8217;ll first have to see better clarity and
less uncertainty for the market to change direction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moser recommended buying shares of European companies that
rely on emerging markets for revenue rather than those mainly
exposed to the domestic economy, which will &#8220;face difficult
times in Europe.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It isn&#8217;t so much European growth that matters, but
overall global growth,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Companies with a global
reach are going to be able to generate growth in the next
years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 2012, Goldman Sachs has an &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on the
health-care, oil and gas and telecommunications industries,
citing strong dividends and cash flows that may provide a &#8220;nice
cushion if the market falls.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Moser said he is &#8220;underweight&#8221; in
financial shares as well as the food and beverage industry as
they have &#8220;structural issues and are extremely expensive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

Moore" date="Jan 13, 2012  7:45 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-13/jpmorgan-cuts-investment-bank-s-pay-pool-to-341-552-per-person-on-average.html"><headline>JPMorgan Investment-Bank Pay Pool Falls to $341,552 Per Person</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s investment
bank cut employee compensation 9 percent to $8.88 billion in
2011 as the division generated 0.2 percent more revenue last
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expense, which includes salaries, bonuses and benefits,
was enough to give each of the unit&#8217;s 25,999 employees an
average of $341,552, according to figures posted today on the
New York-based company&#8217;s website. The division set aside $9.73
billion in 2010 to pay traders, dealmakers and other personnel,
or $369,651 for each of the 26,314 people on staff (JPM) at the end of
that year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bank had 616 fewer people at the end
of the fourth quarter than at the end of the previous three-
month period and 315 fewer than a year earlier, according to the
disclosure. Staff companywide expanded 8 percent to 260,157 from
2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jes Staley, chief executive officer of JPMorgan&#8217;s
investment bank, set aside 34 percent of the division&#8217;s revenue
for pay last year, down from 37 percent in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment-bank employees were bracing for a smaller-than-
usual bonus pool even as annual net income for the unit climbed
2 percent to $6.79 billion from a year earlier. A portion of the
division&#8217;s quarterly profits came from one-time accounting
adjustments, skewing results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quarterly revenue at the investment-banking unit slid last
year from $8.23 billion in the first quarter to $4.36 billion in
the fourth quarter as concerns mounted that the debt crisis in
Greece would spread to other European nations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average compensation figures, which don&#8217;t represent
individual workers&#8217; actual pay, are derived by dividing the
overall compensation pool by the number of employees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. and Seoul-based LG

&lt;p&gt;According to a statement from Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft, the agreement provides coverage for LG tablets,

&lt;p&gt;Terms of the agreement weren&#8217;t disclosed. In the Microsoft

&lt;p&gt;EU Nations Near Agreement on Common Patent System, Barroso Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Commission President Jose Barroso said the
European Union is near agreement on the EU&#8217;s first region-wide
patent system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Frankly, we are almost there,&#8221; Barroso told reporters
yesterday in Copenhagen. &#8220;There are now some divisions between
France, Germany and Britain on things that are not so
difficult.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While governments from all but two of the 27 EU nations
have agreed on the basic structure of the patent system, discord
remains &#8220;on all points&#8221; concerning the creation of a patent
court, Pierre Delsaux, deputy director general in EU Internal
Markets Commissioner Michel Barnier&#8217;s department, said on Dec.
7. Last March, 25 EU nations agreed to move ahead with a common
patent system; Italy and Spain opted out of the plans because
they objected to the language proposals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We can finalize this community patent that we have been
discussing for 30 years,&#8221; Barroso said yesterday. &#8220;So it&#8217;s
about time to come to a solution.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AB InBev Buys Budweiser Trademark in Budejovice, HN Reports &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anheuser Busch InBev NV bought parts of Budweiser beer
trademarks from Harvestor, a company that operates a brewery in
Ceske Budejovice, the Czech city that is home to rival brewer
Budejovicky Budvar NP, Hospodarske Noviny reported, citing
Michal Donath, a Harvestor spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harvestor, which spun off the trademarks from its other
beer assets in Ceske Budejovice before the sale, will continue
to produce beer in its Samson brewery in the Czech city,
Hospodarske added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corbis&#8217; GreenLight Unit Will Represent Martin Luther King Jr. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corbis Corp.&#8217;s GreenLight unit has been selected to manage
advertising, promotion and merchandise related to the late
Martin Luther King Jr. Seattle-based Corbis is owned by
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) founder Bill Gates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement marks the first time the estate of the late
civil rights leader has worked with an external agency,
according to a GreenLight statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the years since King&#8217;s death in 1968, members of his
family have clashed over intellectual property rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October 2008, his daughter Bernice King refused to hand
over the love letters her mother received from her father. The
estate had signed a $1.4 million contract with Pearson Plc&#8217;s
Penguin Group for a biography of King&#8217;s widow, the late Coretta Scott King. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernice and her brother Martin Luther King III said they
hadn&#8217;t been included in negotiations with Steven Speilberg&#8217;s
DreamWorks SKG over the use of their father&#8217;s story in a
proposed film. That deal was put together by their brother,
Dexter King, on behalf of the estate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Destiny, Envirosight Settle &#8216;Clipstream&#8217; Trademark Dispute &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Destiny Media Technologies Inc. (DSNY) settled a trademark
infringement suit related to its &#8220;clipstream&#8221; trademark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Destiny, based in Vancouver, British Columbia, sued a New
Jersey maker of digital video software and hardware for
trademark infringement in federal court in Newark, New Jersey,
in January 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company claimed that Randolph, New Jersey-based
Envirosight was trying to trade on goodwill associated with the
mark by using it in connection with Envirosight products.
Destiny sued after a cease-and-desist letter had no effect,
according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement agreement mandated that Envirosight quit
using &#8220;clipstream&#8221; with any of its products and services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Destiny, which offers content companies a secure
distribution system for their music, had sought money damages
and attorney fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to court documents, Envirosight was ordered to
pay Destiny $3,000, and to remove a press release to which
Destiny had objected. Destiny was given permission to issue a
statement about the dispute&#8217;s settlement, containing no
reference to the monetary component of dispute or disparagement
of Envirosight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Destiny Software Productions Inc. v.
Envirosight LLC, 2:11-cv-00210-PGS-ES, U.S. District Court,

&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leahy Proposes Change to Hollywood-Backed Anti-Piracy Measure &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee proposed
changing a Hollywood-backed anti-piracy bill that has drawn
objections from Google Inc. (GOOG), Facebook Inc. and other Internet
companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, said yesterday
he would submit an amendment requiring further study on a
provision requiring Internet-service providers, when served with
a court order, to block websites selling pirated content or
counterfeit goods. The full Senate is scheduled to hold a
procedural vote on the measure, the Protect IP Act, on Jan. 24. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leahy has &#8220;continued to hear concerns about the Domain
Name provision from engineers, human rights groups and others,&#8221;
the senator said in an e-mailed statement, adding that he&#8217;s
&#8220;&#8216;prepared to recommend we give it more study before
implementing it.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill, which has more than 40 Senate co-sponsors and was
approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee in May, would still
let the Justice Department seek court orders requiring search
engines, payment services and advertising networks to block or
cease business with non-U.S. sites linked to piracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate measure and a similar House bill are backed by
the movie and music industries as a way to crack down on sales
of illegally copied content. Internet companies are waging a
campaign to block the legislation, saying it will spur online
censorship and threaten the growth of the technology industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to resume
consideration of the House version of the bill, the Stop Online
Piracy Act, when Congress returns from its recess. The committee
hasn&#8217;t set a date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taiwan Museum Employees Indicted Over Unauthorized Copying &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two employees of Taipei&#8217;s National Palace Museum were
indicted for making unauthorized copies of images belonging to
the museum, the China Post reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were accused of making unauthorized copies of almost
3,000 images of the earliest and largest Chinese Encyclopedia,
the Yongle Canon, which was compiled in 1408, according to the
China Post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were also found in possession of almost 4,000
digitized images of cultural works and publications, the
newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the copyright charges, the two ex-employees
were accused of taking bribes from a printing company that won a
bid to print ancient Buddhist texts, according to the China
Post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Persian Carpet Wins Default Judgment Over &#8216;Ginkgo&#8217; Rug Design &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Persian Carpet Co., a carpet wholesaler and manufacturer
based in Durham, North Carolina, won a copyright infringement
case against a New York-based carpet importer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit, filed in federal court in North Carolina in
August 2010, was related to &#8216;&#8216;The Ginkgo,&#8221; a rug design created
in 1997 by Persian Carpet. The company claimed that Tashi Dhan
Galaicha Udhyog had made and sold &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of copies of the
Ginkgo design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to one website through which Persian Carpet&#8217;s
products are sold, &#8220;The Ginkgo&#8221; is a carpet containing
botanical elements of a ginkgo leaf, using the symmetrical
patterns of the Prairie Style. Rugs from Persian Carpet sell for
$35 per square foot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an order signed by U.S. District Judge Thomas D.
Schroeder, Persian Carpet was awarded damages in excess of
$302,000 and another $6,000 for attorney fees and litigation
costs. The defendants were ordered to quit selling copies of the
Ginkgo carpet and to destroy all infringing rugs in their
possession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tashi Dhan Galaicha Udhyog didn&#8217;t respond to the complaint
and the court entered a default judgment against the rug
importer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Persian Carpet was represented by Larry L. Coats of Coats 
Bennett PLLC of Cary, North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is The Persian Carpet Inc. v. Tashi Dhan Galaicha
Udhyog, 1:1-cv-00604-TDS-LPW, U.S. District Court, Middle
District of North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) plans to make a final
investment decision on its offshore Bangka gas field in
Indonesia&#8217;s East Kalimantan province in 2013, according to
BPMigas, the nation&#8217;s oil and gas regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron will need to sign contracts with BPMigas including
natural gas sales accords and an extension of a production
sharing contract in the Makassar Straits before making its final
investment decision, BPMigas Chairman R. Priyono said in a
statement posted on the regulator&#8217;s website today. Gareth
Johnstone, a spokesman for Chevron in Singapore, did not
immediately comment when contacted by e-mail and phone today.
The company is &#8220;continuing to advance&#8221; the Bangka project
through its design phase, Chevron said Dec. 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia, Southeast Asia&#8217;s largest crude producer, is
struggling to stem a decline in output from aging oil and gas
fields that led to the country withdrawing from the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The project can&#8217;t be delayed because it is very
strategic,&#8221; said Priyono. &#8220;A one-day delay could cause a loss
of tens of billions rupiah for the government.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangka, which is one of three sections of Chevron&#8217;s deep
sea natural gas project off East Kalimantan, may start
production in 2015, the regulator said in a Dec. 16
presentation. The field is expected to have peak production of
110 million cubic feet a day, Gde Pradnyana, a BPMigas
spokesman, said Dec. 21. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Iusacell SA (CEL*), Mexico&#8217;s third-
largest wireless carrier, may &#8220;disappear&#8221; if antitrust
officials reject its plan to accept an investment from Grupo
Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO), the company&#8217;s top lawyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iusacell is concerned about speculation that the antitrust
agency will block Televisa&#8217;s planned $1.6 billion investment,
said Francisco Borrego, chief legal counsel for billionaire
Ricardo Salinas, who controls the wireless carrier. There are no
legal grounds to reject the deal, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If Iusacell doesn&#8217;t receive a large investment, it will
little by little lose its ability to pay its debts,&#8221; Borrego
said yesterday in a phone interview. &#8220;If they don&#8217;t attend to
us, Iusacell could disappear.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The antitrust agency has given no official indication it
will reject the agreement, which was announced in April, Borrego
said. The agency&#8217;s discussions with the companies have sometimes
echoed the arguments of critics of the deal, he said. The
companies believe the law requires the agency to approve the
deal by Feb. 7, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Federal Competition Commission official who can&#8217;t be
named under the agency&#8217;s policy declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa, the world&#8217;s largest Spanish-language broadcaster,
would acquire 50 percent of Iusacell with the investment. The
Mexico City-based company seeks to add wireless service to its
portfolio of home-phone, cable-TV and Internet plans to compete
with billionaire Carlos Slim&#8217;s America Movil SAB. (AMXL) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monopoly Risk &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iusacell is closely held by Salinas, who also controls TV
Azteca SAB, Televisa&#8217;s closest competitor in Mexico&#8217;s broadcast
television market. Allowing the two groups to work together
would risk creating a communications monopoly, the Mexican
Association for the Right to Information said in an October
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa and Azteca plan to continue competing
&#8220;ferociously&#8221; in broadcasting, Borrego said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All of the very extensive information required by the
commission has already been turned in months ago,&#8221; a Televisa
official, who can&#8217;t be named under company policy, said in an e-
mail. &#8220;Grupo Televisa is confident that it will get approval.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iusacell has less than 5 percent of the market, and the
antitrust agency has said it is working to increase competition
in the mobile-phone business, Televisa said. The agency
concluded in 2010 that America Movil, which has 70 percent of
Mexico&#8217;s wireless users, is dominant in the market for mobile-
phone plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, the antitrust agency said it had started an
investigation into agreements between phone carriers and TV
programming providers, without naming the companies. While the
agency hasn&#8217;t contacted Salinas&#8217;s companies or Televisa about
the new probe, the companies believe it is directed at them,
Borrego said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is moving
to a &#8220;should we do this&#8221; model of banking from a creed of
&#8220;can we do this,&#8221; President and Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn said in an interview with the Sunday Telegraph. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We were the best firm in the world at analyzing &#8216;can we
do something,&#8217;&#8221; Cohn said in the interview. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t have as
many checkpoints on &#8216;should we do something.&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My whole world now is &#8216;should we do something,&#8217;&#8221; said
Cohn, according to the newspaper. &#8220;Those are very difficult
issues.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has declined to sell some high-risk products
to clients even though they&#8217;re legal and the bank has turned
away business that may be connected to sanctioned countries such
as Iran and Sudan, the Sunday Telegraph reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohn said the banking industry faces &#8220;real consolidation&#8221;
and that Goldman Sachs will maintain its market share because
competitors are leaving the business, the Telegraph reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. could lose some
$5 billion from its investments in southern Europe should the
euro-region crisis deteriorate significantly, Welt am Sonntag
reported, citing an interview with the company&#8217;s chief executive
officer, Jamie Dimon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a loss, which would represent around 30 percent of its
total $16 billion invested in the region, would &#8220;damage us but
not kill us,&#8221; Welt cited Dimon as saying. The company hasn&#8217;t
reduced its investments in Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece or
Spain, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon said there was a 60 percent chance of Europe pulling
through the crisis, according to the newspaper. The euro is
Europe&#8217;s greatest achievement of the last century, he said,
urging member states not to return to their national currencies,
Welt reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Karin Matussek" date="Jan 16, 2012  9:51 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-16/jpmorgan-pforzheim-urged-to-settle-71-million-swap-lawsuit.html"><headline>JPMorgan, Pforzheim Urged to Settle $71 Million Swap Suit</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and the German
city of Pforzheim should settle a dispute over 56 million euros
($71 million) in losses on an interest-rate swap, a judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city should accept one-third of the amount, Presiding
Judge Daniel Koehler told the parties at a hearing in Frankfurt
today. While the city may win the case if it can prove that it
wasn&#8217;t properly informed about the initial market value of the
derivative, this isn&#8217;t guaranteed and proceedings may drag on
for a long time, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A settlement would pour money in the city&#8217;s coffers right
away,&#8221; Koehler said. &#8220;The amounts at stake aren&#8217;t peanuts and
both sides face considerable risks in this case.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city of Pforzheim is among several European
municipalities that lost millions of euros on derivative
transactions that went sour. After Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Germany&#8217;s
biggest bank, lost a case over interest-rate swaps at Germany&#8217;s
highest civil court last year, cities and small companies are
trying to recover their losses in court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the city said the settlement amount proposed by
the judge wouldn&#8217;t be acceptable and that the city council must
consider the issue. JPMorgan&#8217;s lawyer said he will discuss the
proposal with his client. The court scheduled a ruling for March
23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank Mirror &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pforzheim bought the swap to mirror a derivative it had
acquired from Deutsche Bank that accumulated 20 million euros of
losses. Over time, the Deutsche Bank transaction turned
positive, while the swap from JPMorgan incurred about 60 million
euros in losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under most interest-rate swap agreements sold to utilities,
medium-size companies and cities, the lender paid a fixed rate
and the customer an amount based on Euribor rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top court&#8217;s reasoning in the Deutsche Bank ruling would
apply in this case, so JPMorgan had a duty to disclose any
negative market value, Judge Koehler said. While the city had
experience with swaps and the negotiations were handled by two
women with some knowledge in the area, that didn&#8217;t exclude the
bank&#8217;s duty to advise its customer, he said. The court&#8217;s
assessment is preliminary, the judge added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty much like in the top court case, there was
also a person with some economic education on the customer
side,&#8221; Koehler said. &#8220;Our top court tends to increase the
consumer-like protection it grants cities and small business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pforzheim claims it didn&#8217;t know the negative market value
was 23 million euros instead of 20 million euros. JPMorgan
lawyer Carsten van de Sande told the court the bank always made
clear its profit margin and structuring cost for the instrument
were priced into the swap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You can&#8217; take a chance without any risk,&#8221; said van de
Sande. &#8220;Pforzheim could also have decided to simply pay back
the 20 millon euros to Deutsche Bank at the time and not buy the
swap from JPMorgan.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s case is LG Frankfurt, 2-25 O 669/10. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The service, branded ABC TV On Demand, will make shows

Lovefilm has announced at least three content deals this month

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Medivation Inc. (MDVN)
ended their collaboration on the experimental drug Dimebon for
Alzheimer&#8217;s disease after the medicine failed in another late-
stage clinical trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimebon was one of two drugs New York-based Pfizer had in
its late-stage pipeline to treat the neurodegenerative disease.
The other is bapineuzumab, which Pfizer is developing with
Johnson  Johnson. The treatments have different mechanisms of
action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimebon didn&#8217;t show statistically significant results in a
study that evaluated the compound when added to a standard
treatment in patients with mild to moderate forms of the
disease, the companies said today in a statement. The companies
will end development of the drug for all uses, and will stop a
current study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medivation, based in San Francisco, dropped 3.3 percent to
$53.90 at the close in New York. Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, gained less than 1 percent to $21.94. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimebon also failed in a late-stage trial in 2010, sending
Medivation shares down 67 percent in one day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta estimates that at least 5 million Americans have
Alzheimer&#8217;s. The disease usually begins affecting people around
age 60. There is no known cure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim O&#8217;Neill, the economist who
coined the term BRIC a decade ago, said China&#8217;s fourth-quarter
growth rate, while the slowest in more than two years, was
stronger than many analysts had forecast and was a &#8220;blow&#8221; to
those predicting a &#8220;hard landing&#8221; for the nation&#8217;s economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s economy grew 8.9 percent in the fourth quarter from
a year earlier, the statistics bureau said yesterday in Beijing.
That exceeded the 8.7 percent median estimate of 26 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News and is above the 8 percent that
signals a &#8220;soft landing&#8221; for China, according to SinoPac
Financial Holdings Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Neill, chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said
in an interview on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;InsideTrack&#8221; with
Erik Schatzker that if China grew at an annual rate of 7.5
percent this decade, as he forecast, it would contribute more to
world growth in dollar terms than the U.S. and Europe combined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s the most important thing in the world,&#8221; said
O&#8217;Neill, who last month published his new book, &#8220;The Growth
Map,&#8221; with predictions of &#8220;rosy prospects&#8221; for the BRIC
nations of Brazil, Russia, India and China and other developing
markets. &#8220;Some democracy a la Chinese style is going to
emerge,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They want more freedom but they really want
more wealth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overheated Market &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of China&#8217;s key economic challenges is its overheated
property market. Yet China&#8217;s policy makers, by tightening
monetary policy, managed to stem the property bubble, O&#8217;Neill
said, something Western policy makers had failed to do before
the subprime property meltdown that began in the U.S. in the
middle of the last decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;China&#8217;s property prices have turned because Chinese
authorities have deliberately stopped them,&#8221; he said. O&#8217;Neill
said China&#8217;s authorities were raising wages to boost the
domestic economy and move away from its dependence on exports,
while seeking to address international concerns that its yuan
currency is undervalued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are two ways of dealing with exchange-rate issues,
one is moving the nominal exchange rate; the second is to raise
your prices and wages higher than everybody else, and the
Chinese are deliberately doing that with wages,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yuan traded at 6.3150 yesterday, compared with 6.3165
Jan. 16, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
The People&#8217;s Bank of China set the yuan&#8217;s reference rate 0.09
percent stronger at 6.3250. It is allowed to trade 0.5 percent
on either side of the daily fixing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greek Concerns &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding concerns that Greece may default, O&#8217;Neill said
China&#8217;s economy generates the equivalent of Greek gross domestic
product every four months. &#8220;Greece itself is not that
important,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What is important,&#8221; according to
O&#8217;Neill, is &#8220;how Greece deals with the restructuring or a
default, which seems quite possible, and the contagion of that
through the rest of Europe is extremely important.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Neill said European markets had &#8220;sort of&#8221; shrugged off
last week&#8217;s Standard  Poor&#8217;s downgrade of France and eight
other European countries. He said it wasn&#8217;t clear whether that
was because people perceived the European Central Bank is
&#8220;going to be doing more and more&#8221; or there are &#8220;some signs of
some stabilizing in the economy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., a lender to
bankrupt MF Global Holdings Ltd., was given verbal assurance
that a transfer of segregated customer money to pay an overdraft
followed the rules governing treatment of customers&#8217; money,
according to a person familiar with the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assurance was given by an MF Global treasurer, Edith O&#8217;Brien, or someone in her office, after JPMorgan wrote asking
for confirmation that the transfer was in accordance with
regulations, said the person, who declined to be named because
the communications were private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transfer of $200 million in segregated customer money
was a subject at congressional hearings on the downfall of the
commodity firm formerly run by Jon Corzine. Corzine, a former
New Jersey governor and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. co-chairman,
said at the hearing he was assured that the transfer followed
the rules set up to protect customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reid Weingarten, a lawyer for O&#8217;Brien, declined to comment
on the case. Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for New York-based
JPMorgan, declined to comment on the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan received no written response to its letter,
probably addressed to O&#8217;Brien, in the busy days before the
bankruptcy, said the person familiar with the transfer. However,
the bank was told the transfer was proper, as Corzine testified,
the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MF Global parent filed the eighth-largest U.S.
bankruptcy on Oct. 31 after getting margin calls and other
demands for money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Liquidity Issues&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global used about $700 million of customer funds to
&#8220;meet liquidity issues&#8221; at its broker-dealer in the days
before the bankruptcy, according to CME Group Inc. (CME), which had
auditing authority over the failed futures broker. Customer
funds were also used to make a loan of about $175 million to MF
Global&#8217;s U.K. subsidiary, according to Terrence Duffy, CME
Group&#8217;s executive chairman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CME Group disclosed details of its dealings with MF Global
in documents released in December by the oversight panel of the
House Financial Services Committee. Christine Serwinski, chief
financial officer for North America at MF Global, and O&#8217;Brien
told Mike Procajlo, an exchange auditor, at around 1 a.m. on
Oct. 31 in Serwinski&#8217;s Chicago office that the customer money
was transferred on Oct. 27 and Oct. 28 and possibly Oct. 26,
according to a CME Group timeline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missing Money &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the MF Global brokerage, which is being separately
liquidated by trustee James Giddens, a spokesman said, &#8220;The
investigation being conducted by the trustee will closely
examine accounts at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) held in the name of the
broker-dealer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giddens, who has returned about 72 percent of MF Global
customers&#8217; assets, has said $1.2 billion or more is missing from
their segregated accounts. His search for missing money
coordinates with simultaneous probes by the U.S. Justice
Department, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and other
regulators, said spokesman Kent Jarrell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, was agent for a
$1.2 billion loan to the broker-dealer&#8217;s parent, and also for a
$300 million loan to the brokerage, according to court papers.
The broker-dealer paid JPMorgan and the other secured lenders
back for the $300 million loan, Giddens has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the bank received so-called preferential payments before
the brokerage went into liquidation, or other payments, Giddens
will deal &#8220;appropriately&#8221; with the transfers or other issues,
he said in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trustee was responding to a query from a judge about
whether he was disinterested enough to sue JPMorgan if
necessary, in light of his law firm&#8217;s past work for the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, with Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp.,
was also among banks that loaned the MF Global finance unit $1.5
billion, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parent&#8217;s bankruptcy case is MF Global Holdings Ltd.,

York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C) joined JPMorgan Chase
 Co. (JPM) in posting its lowest revenue since the height of 2008&#8217;s
financial crisis as trading slumped. Wells Fargo  Co.&#8217;s revenue
slid less as core lending businesses improved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup said fourth-quarter revenue fell 7 percent from a
year earlier to $17.2 billion. Net income declined 11 percent to
$1.17 billion as trading revenue dropped 37 percent, excluding
accounting adjustments, and investment banking tumbled 45
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concern that the European debt crisis would lead to a
global economic slowdown curbed trading volume and investment-
banking deals in the year&#8217;s second half. Wells Fargo, which
relies least on trading among the six biggest U.S. banks, said a
focus on loans helped soften the blow, with revenue down 4
percent to $20.6 billion. It had a record fourth-quarter profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The banks with capital markets are ugly,&#8221; said James Reynolds, chief executive officer of Loop Capital Markets LLC,
on Bloomberg Television. &#8220;Fundamental banking looks OK.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup fell 6.8 percent to $28.66 as of 12:37 p.m. in
New York, the worst performance in the 24-company KBW Bank
Index. Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, advanced 1.3 percent
to $29.98. New York-based JPMorgan declined 2.2 percent to
$35.12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. banks&#8217; revenue growth in 2011 was probably the slowest
since the Great Depression and is unlikely to improve in 2012,
Mike Mayo, an analyst at CLSA Ltd., said on Bloomberg Television
last month. JPMorgan, the nation&#8217;s largest bank by assets, said
last week that revenue fell 18 percent to $21.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cutting Jobs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup&#8217;s revenue was the lowest since the fourth quarter
of 2008, excluding a charge it took in the last period of 2009
tied to its repayment of government bailout funds. The New York-
based bank said today it would eliminate about 5,000 employees,
with about 25 percent coming from the securities and banking
business. It had disclosed plans last month to cut 4,500 jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. bank by market value, boosted
net income 20 percent to $4.11 billion, beating analysts&#8217;
estimates. Total commercial loan balances rose 7.3 percent from
the year-earlier period to $345.5 billion, while consumer loans
held on balance sheet fell 2.5 percent to $424.2 billion. The
bank also set aside less money for soured loans than a year
earlier and said it will continue seeking profits in residential
real estate, even after the U.S. housing collapse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We like the mortgage business,&#8221; Wells Fargo Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf said today on a conference
call to discuss results. &#8220;We have been taking share in that
business. For two-thirds of Americans it&#8217;s the most significant
financial asset they&#8217;ll have.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital to Shareholders &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stumpf, 58, reduced his staff by 3 percent to 264,200 and
reaffirmed plans to trim $1.5 billion in quarterly costs by the
end of this year. The bank plans on &#8220;returning even more
capital to our shareholders,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup&#8217;s earnings slump capped a year for CEO Vikram Pandit, 55, in which the shares slid 44 percent amid concern 
troubled European countries would default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s revenue from trading stocks and bonds fell 9.8
percent, including accounting adjustments, from the same period
in 2010. Earnings also declined as the company sold unwanted
assets, and expenses rose 4 percent to $12.9 billion amid a push
to expand emerging-markets businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup&#8217;s fourth-quarter results have missed analysts&#8217;
estimates in five consecutive years, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. For all quarters since 2004, Citigroup has beaten
estimates 54 percent of the time, compared with the 68 percent
average of 22 banks in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. Only 43
companies in the SP, including two lenders, have worse
negative-surprise records. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s computer-network-
management software, a product that Chief Executive Officer
Steve Ballmer once came close to scrapping, emerges today as the
cornerstone of a bid to challenge VMware Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new version of System Center 2012 will be released as
part of its final testing phase, said Brad Anderson, a vice
president in Microsoft&#8217;s management and security division. The
software is used with Windows and virtualization software,
letting companies turn their servers into so-called private
clouds. The offering is cheaper than VMware&#8217;s competing product
and has equivalent features, Anderson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies use cloud computing to store and run programs via
the Internet. While the approach spares them from having to
store data locally, many businesses want to run them in-house
for better control; hence, the appeal of private clouds. Though
VMware has an edge in this area, Microsoft should pose a
stronger challenge this year, said Al Gillen, an analyst at
Framingham, Massachusetts-based research firm IDC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The stage is being set for a very brutal competition
between Microsoft and VMware,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You are going to see
a lot of focus around price. Until now, VMware&#8217;s (VMW) functionality
has been so much better that they haven&#8217;t had to compete on
price. That&#8217;s going to change.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the goals of cloud computing is to give customers
access to a pool of computing power and storage that can easily
be assigned to a particular program, without the need for
information-technology staff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public and Private &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies like Microsoft and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) that run
public clouds use their own data centers to store and operate
programs for customers. In a private cloud, the client wants the
same flexibility, cost savings and ease of use in their own data
centers. While that requires virtualization software to combine
multiple programs on one server, it also relies on network-
management software like System Center, Anderson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud has been a key factor in the rising importance of
Microsoft&#8217;s management software. When Anderson joined the
company in 2003 from Novell Inc. (NOVL), he said the product, then
called Systems Management Server, was largely used to help
companies roll out programs and security patches to workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development was running more than two years late and
unbeknownst to Anderson at the time, Ballmer had told the
leadership team that if the schedule slipped again, he would
cancel the product. After a few weeks at Microsoft, Anderson sat
in his first meeting with Chairman Bill Gates, who asked him why
the company needed it at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billion-Dollar Sales &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, Microsoft got about $250 million in annual
sales from management software, Anderson said. Two years ago,
the business broke the $1 billion mark, he said. Anderson
declined to provide more recent revenue numbers. VMware, based
in Palo Alto, California, doesn&#8217;t break out revenue for its
equivalent business line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with the growth, Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft
hasn&#8217;t been able to compete on a par with VMware, Anderson said.
Four years ago, at meetings with customers at a Microsoft
conference in Barcelona, Spain, that message was clear, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I came away feeling we have a lot of work to do,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;That even though their price was 5X ours, we didn&#8217;t have
the capabilities to even have that conversation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, with improvements to the management tools,
as well as Windows Server and Microsoft&#8217;s Hyper-V virtualization
software, that&#8217;s starting to change. After the debut of the last
test version today, the final System Center 2012 will be
released in the first half of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unilever, Lufthansa &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker, counts
Unilever NV (UNA) among its private-cloud customers, Anderson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VMware still has an advantage because of its leading role
in virtualization software, which gives more flexibility to
servers. Microsoft&#8217;s Hyper-V product has 25 percent of the
market, according to IDC, compared with VMware&#8217;s 52 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies that already have VMware installed will stick
with it if they opt for private clouds, Gillen said. Still,
Microsoft will provide stronger competition for new projects, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is the release that gets them really into the
private-cloud conversation,&#8221; said Mary Johnston Turner, also an
analyst at IDC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks rose, giving the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index its best start to a year since 1987,
after confidence among homebuilders topped forecasts, Goldman
Sachs (GS) Group Inc. rallied and concern about Europe eased. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs climbed 6.8 percent as earnings beat
estimates amid lower compensation costs. Bank of America Corp. (BAC)
and JPMorgan (JPM) Chase  Co. jumped at least 4.6 percent, leading
the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. PulteGroup Inc. (PHM)
and Lennar Corp. added more than 4.3 percent, pacing an advance
in homebuilders. A measure of chipmakers rose the most in the
SP 500 among 24 industries, rallying 3.9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 increased 1.1 percent to 1,308.04 at 4 p.m. New
York time, closing above 1,300 for the first time since July.
The Dow advanced 96.88 points, or 0.8 percent, to 12,578.95. The
Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 1.5 percent to 2,769.71. The
Russell 2000 Index jumped 1.8 percent to 779.26. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s great to see the market up,&#8221; John Carey, a Boston-
based money manager at Pioneer Investments, said in a telephone
interview. The firm oversees about $220 billion. &#8220;People are
realizing that Europe is important, but it&#8217;s not the whole
world. They are looking at the economic numbers in the U.S. and
seeing that we&#8217;re not going back into a recession. The economy
is still growing. We might be all right at the end of the day.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 has risen 4 percent this year as measures of
commodity, financial and industrial shares rallied at least 6.4
percent. The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index of companies most-
tied to the economy has surged 11 percent in 2012, with Alcoa
Inc. (AA) and Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) soaring at least 15 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highest Since 2007 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks climbed today as confidence among U.S. homebuilders
rose in January to the highest level since 2007. Equities
extended gains as an official told reporters that Greece&#8217;s
government could forge an agreement with private creditors by
the end of this week after talks resumed in Athens today. The
International Monetary Fund is proposing to raise its lending
capacity by as much as $500 billion to safeguard the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors need a new excuse to commit more capital,&#8221;
Michael Shaoul, chairman of Marketfield Asset Management in New
York, which oversees $1.3 billion, said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;The acute stress of Europe has moderated. Given
that we already have good economic data, the most obvious new
excuse is earnings. I would expect a decent earnings season.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies in the benchmark index, which beat profit
estimates in the previous 11 quarters, probably will report a
4.6 percent increase in per-share earnings during the September-
December period, analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homebuilders Rally &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nine out of 10 industries in the SP 500 rallied as
financial and technology gauges advanced at least 1.6 percent. A
gauge of homebuilders in SP indexes climbed 4.6 percent.
PulteGroup added 5.9 percent to $7.94. Lennar (LEN) jumped 4.4 percent
to $23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs rose 6.8 percent to $104.31. Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein cut compensation 21 percent in 2011
as he reduced costs and focused on international growth to
offset a slowdown in trading, which contributes most of the
firm&#8217;s revenue. Goldman Sachs&#8217;s higher-than-estimated earnings
contrasted with previous reports from Citigroup Inc. (C), which fell
short of analysts&#8217; estimates, and JPMorgan, which matched
projections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the largest financial companies also climbed. Bank
of America advanced 4.9 percent to $6.80. JPMorgan added 4.7
percent to $36.54. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK) fell 4.6 percent to $20.30.
The world&#8217;s biggest custody bank said fourth-quarter earnings
declined 26 percent on a restructuring charge and lower revenue
from businesses tied to financial markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales Forecast &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index surged 5 percent as
all of its 30 stocks advanced. Linear Technology Corp. (LLTC) jumped 12
percent, the most in the SP 500, to $33.32. The maker of
semiconductors for industrial equipment and cars forecast fiscal
third-quarter sales that would beat analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) gained 3.2 percent to $15.92 as Jerry Yang&#8217;s
exit may remove a barrier to find a buyer or negotiate a sale of
stakes in Asian assets valued at more than $10 billion. Now that
the co-founder and one-time chief executive officer has cut his
leadership ties to Yahoo, newly appointed CEO Scott Thompson has
freer rein to unwind the company&#8217;s part-ownership of Alibaba
Group Holding Ltd. and Yahoo Japan Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. companies that beat analysts&#8217; earnings estimates are
an exception, rather than the rule, for the fourth-quarter
reporting season getting under way. Only 47.1 percent of
companies in the SP 500 that posted quarterly results between
Dec. 1 and yesterday exceeded the average projection, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial Crisis &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So-called positive surprises have surpassed 50 percent at a
comparable point in every other quarterly reporting period for
the past four years. The previous low was 51.5 percent in the
third quarter of 2008, when a global financial crisis was taking
hold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Early reporters&#8217; results&#8221; are one of two reasons to
expect the current earnings season to be disappointing, Thomas M. Doerflinger, a strategist at UBS AG, wrote yesterday in a
report. The other is that many companies are likely to cut
estimates for this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Christine Harper" date="Jan 18, 2012  4:16 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-18/goldman-sachs-profit-drops-58-beats-analyst-estimates-on-cost-reductions.html"><headline>Goldman Shares Rise as Net Tops Estimates</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) climbed 6.8
percent in New York trading after the bank reported profit that
exceeded analysts&#8217; estimates, helped by a reduction in
compensation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares rose $6.63 to $104.31 at 4:15 p.m., after
reaching $105.83 earlier today. Fourth-quarter net income at the
New York-based company dropped 58 percent to $1.01 billion, or
$1.84 a share, beating the $1.23 average estimate of 26 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 57, cut
compensation 21 percent in 2011 as he reduced costs and focused
on international growth to offset a slowdown in trading, which
contributes most of the firm&#8217;s revenue. Goldman Sachs&#8217;s higher-
than-estimated earnings contrasted with previous reports from
Citigroup Inc. (C), which fell short of analysts&#8217; estimates, and
JPMorgan Chase  Co., which matched projections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When you do have challenges on the top line, the first
thing you look at as a securities analyst is &#8216;are you managing
your costs?&#8217;&#8221; William Fitzpatrick, a Milwaukee-based financial-
services analyst at Manulife Asset Management, said on Bloomberg
Television&#8217;s &#8220;InsideTrack.&#8221; &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen a couple of the banks
who aren&#8217;t necessarily doing that very well, but Goldman Sachs
clearly has a good handle on that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs reduced the amount of revenue it paid out in
compensation during the fourth quarter to 36.5 percent, while
analysts including Ed Najarian at International Strategy 
Investment Group Inc. were expecting a ratio closer to 43
percent. The company&#8217;s tax rate fell to 28 percent for the year,
compared with 30.3 percent for the first nine months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cost Cuts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s target is to reduce annual costs by $1.4
billion, more than the initial $1.2 billion goal set in the
middle of last year, David A. Viniar, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s chief
financial officer, said on a conference call with investors
today. The company eliminated 2,400 jobs last year and reduced
the size of its balance sheet to $923 billion at the end of the
year from $949 billion three months earlier, the first quarterly
decline since the end of 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While it is not possible to cut expenses as a means to
prosperity, we understand the benefits of a proactive and
disciplined approach particularly if the operating environment
remains challenging,&#8221; Viniar said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Viniar echoed recent comments by
Blankfein that the firm expects business to rebound. He compared
the current slowdown with the collapse of hedge fund Long-Term
Capital Management LP in late 1998, the decline in technology
stocks in 2000 and the credit crisis in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different World &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen downturns before,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Every time
you&#8217;re in one if feels like it&#8217;s never going to end and that the
world is different now. I wouldn&#8217;t say, for example, that the
environment feels worse than it felt in the fall of 2008 or
necessarily after the tech bubble burst, nor necessarily after
the fall of 1998.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income for the year fell 47 percent to $4.44 billion,
the lowest since 2008. Return on average common shareholders&#8217;
equity, known as ROE, was 3.7 percent for the year, down from
11.5 percent in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Yes, we&#8217;re going to be prudent in managing our capital,
yes we&#8217;re going to be prudent in managing our expenses,&#8221; Viniar
said today. &#8220;But our ROE growth is going to largely be driven
by growing our revenues, expanding our footprint, expanding our
client base and growing the firm.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue Miss &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue for 2011 dropped 26 percent to $28.8 billion, the
lowest since 2008, and declined 30 percent in the fourth quarter
to $6.05 billion. The average estimate of 18 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg was for $6.39 billion in fourth-quarter revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compensation, the company&#8217;s biggest expense, decreased to
$12.2 billion for the full year and fell 2 percent to $2.21
billion in the fourth quarter. The cost was 42.4 percent of
total revenue for the full year. The total number of employees
fell to 33,300 at the end of December from 34,200 three months
earlier and from 35,700 a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discretionary compensation for 2011, which refers to cash
and equity bonuses, declined &#8220;significantly more&#8221; than revenue
on a full-year basis, Viniar said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s larger New York-based rivals have also
suffered from the decline in trading. Citigroup, the third-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, said yesterday that fourth-quarter
net income dropped 11 percent as lower revenue from advising
companies and trading securities led to the first quarterly loss
at its investment bank since 2008. JPMorgan, the biggest U.S.
bank, said last week that fourth-quarter net income slid 23
percent as investment bank earnings fell by half. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Encouraging Signs&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As economies and markets improve -- and we see
encouraging signs of this -- Goldman Sachs is very well
positioned to perform for our clients and our shareholders,&#8221;
Blankfein said in the company&#8217;s statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last year Goldman Sachs lost about 50 partners, the
highest rank of employees who share in a special compensation
pool and are elected every two years. Among the departures were
six members of the management committee, including trading co-
heads Edward K. Eisler, 42, and David B. Heller, 44, last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viniar said that fewer partners than normal left the firm
over the last four years because they wanted to remain loyal to
Goldman Sachs as it navigated the aftermath of the financial
crisis and blows to its reputation such as the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission&#8217;s 2010 lawsuit against the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partnership Turnover &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You tend to find 15 percent to 20 percent of our
partnership turning over every two years,&#8221; Viniar said. &#8220;It&#8217;s
been like that almost through our history, and you saw far less
than that turning over the last four years. And I think what
you&#8217;re seeing now is, as I said, normal progression.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Institutional client services, the division that handles
sales and trading for customers, generated $3.06 billion in the
fourth quarter, down 16 percent from the same period of 2010.
The business, now supervised by Isabelle Ealet, Pablo J. Salame
and Harvey M. Schwartz, made $17.3 billion in full-year revenue,
down from $21.8 billion in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed-income, currency and commodities trading contributed
$1.36 billion of revenue for the quarter and $9.02 billion for
the year, down from $1.64 billion in the fourth quarter of 2010
and $13.7 billion for that full year. JPMorgan (JPM) last week said
its investment bank produced $2.49 billion of fixed-income
trading revenue in the quarter and $15.3 billion for the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accounting Gains &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s 2011 trading revenue included about $600
million in accounting gains related to the widening of the
company&#8217;s credit spreads during the year, Goldman Sachs said in
the statement. The effect of such adjustments in the fourth
quarter was &#8220;not material,&#8221; the company added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities, the business that Heller supervised, made $1.69
billion in fourth-quarter revenue, down from $2 billion, and
$8.26 billion for the year, up from $8.1 billion in 2010. That
compares with JPMorgan&#8217;s $779 million in fourth-quarter equities
revenue and $4.83 billion for the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs boosted its value-at-risk, the maximum amount
the company estimates it could lose from trading on 95 percent
of days, to $135 million in the fourth quarter -- the highest
level since the second quarter of 2010 -- from $102 million in
the prior quarter, the statement showed. The increase was driven
by &#8220;significantly greater volatility in the interest-rate
category,&#8221; Viniar said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Investment &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing  Lending, which includes the firm&#8217;s gains and
losses on its own stakes in companies, funds and securities,
produced $872 million in fourth-quarter revenue, a 56 percent
drop, and $2.14 billion for the year, a 72 percent decline.
Gains from Goldman Sachs&#8217;s holding in Industrial  Commercial
Bank of China Ltd., the country&#8217;s biggest lender, jumped to $388
million in the quarter from $55 million a year earlier. The
investment recorded a loss of $517 million for the year,
compared with a $747 million gain in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s investment-banking division, managed
worldwide by Richard J. Gnodde, David M. Solomon and John S. Weinberg, made $857 million in revenue for the quarter, down 43
percent from $1.51 billion a year earlier. Revenue for the full
year slid 9 percent to $4.36 billion. JPMorgan made $1.12
billion in fourth-quarter investment-banking fees and a full-
year total of $5.86 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s investment-banking transaction backlog, a
measure of assignments that haven&#8217;t yet been completed, fell in
the fourth quarter compared with the third and was higher than a
year earlier, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial Advisory &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from financial advisory, which includes the mergers
and acquisitions business led globally by Gene T. Sykes in Los
Angeles and London-based Yoel Zaoui, decreased 25 percent in the
fourth quarter to $470 million and retreated 4 percent for the
year to $1.99 billion. Goldman Sachs ranked No. 1 among advisers
on global takeovers in 2011 for the first time since 2008,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter revenue from equity underwriting, led by
London-based Matthew Westerman, decreased 66 percent to $191
million and declined 26 percent to $1.09 billion for the full
year. The bank ranked No. 1 in managing equity, equity-linked
and rights sales in 2011 for the first time since 2006, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Debt-underwriting revenue was down
40 percent in the fourth quarter to $196 million and was
virtually unchanged for the year at $1.28 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment management, overseen by Timothy O&#8217;Neill and Eric S. Lane since the retirement of Edward C. Forst at year-end,
made $1.26 billion in fourth-quarter revenue and $5.03 billion
for the full year. That compares with $1.51 billion in the
fourth quarter of 2010 and $5.01 billion for the full year.
Assets under management climbed to $828 billion from $821
billion three months earlier and compared with $840 billion a
year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
reported that 2011 profit fell to the lowest level since 2008,
spent more to buy back stock than it earned in the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company spent $6.04 billion to repurchase 47 million
shares at an average price of $128.33, more than its $4.44
billion in net income, the New York-based bank said today. It
also paid $1.93 billion in preferred stock dividends during the
year, including $1.64 billion to redeem an investment by Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve and other regulators around the world
have encouraged banks to boost capital to meet requirements
established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Under
the Fed&#8217;s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR,
U.S. lenders must prove they have enough capital to withstand a
&#8220;severe&#8221; U.S. recession before they can increase dividends or
repurchase shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We put in what we want to do and the Fed tells us yes or
no,&#8221; David A. Viniar, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s chief financial officer,
told analysts when asked how the bank was able to spend more on
buybacks than it earns. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you should expect that
it will be a long-term sustainable way we do things of buying
back more than earnings.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viniar estimated that Goldman Sachs had so-called Tier 1
common equity equal to just under 8 percent of the bank&#8217;s risk-
weighted assets at the end of 2011 under the Basel III
requirements. Based on analysts&#8217; current estimates for the
bank&#8217;s earnings and the maturity of some assets, Viniar said the
capital would be &#8220;a little bit below 11 percent&#8221; of assets at
the end of 2013. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave Checketts, former Madison

chairman and chief executive officer of Legends Hospitality
Management LLC, the concessions, merchandising and management-
services company owned by the New York Yankees, Dallas Cowboys
and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checketts succeeds Michael Rawlings, who in June was
elected mayor of Dallas and is a partner of CIC Partners, whose
stake in Legends Checketts will acquire, the company said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News reported in December that a group led by
Checketts, 56, was in talks with Legends to take about a 16
percent stake in the company, which was created in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have always looked to associate myself with strong
brands and successful businesses,&#8221; Checketts said in the
statement. &#8220;In fact, between Goldman Sachs, the Dallas Cowboys
and New York Yankees, I&#8217;m sure you cannot get any better.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newark, New Jersey-based Legends supplies concessions to
Yankee Stadium and Cowboys Stadium. The Yankees are Major League
Baseball&#8217;s most valuable team and the Cowboys are the National
Football League&#8217;s most valuable club according to annual
rankings by Forbes. Each own 34 percent of Legends. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is seeking
$2 billion to $3.5 billion for its first dedicated energy
private-equity fund, according to two prospective investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund, Broad Street Energy Partners, will invest
globally in areas such as oil, gas and power, said the
investors, who asked not to be named because the information is
private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs joins a growing lineup of firms raising pools
of capital to take advantage of increased demand for energy and
commodities. Barclays Natural Resource Investments, a unit of
Barclays Capital, is raising its first dedicated private-equity
energy fund to make investments globally. Blackstone Group LP (BX),
the largest private-equity firm, and Apollo Global Management (APO)
are also marketing debut energy funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, declined
to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new fund will be managed by the principal investment
team of the bank. Kenneth Pontarelli, head of natural resources
and a managing director in the merchant-banking division at
Goldman Sachs, is heading the effort, according to the
investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs merchant-banking division has made energy
private-equity investments in the past out of its global
private-equity funds, and Pontarelli managed those energy deals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) asked a New
York state court judge to order arbitration in a lawsuit against
the investment bank by Basis Yield Alpha Fund or dismiss the
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basis Yield Alpha Fund, a unit of Australian hedge fund
Basis Capital Funds Management Ltd., sued Goldman Sachs in New
York State Supreme Court in October, accusing the bank of making
false and misleading statements and omissions in connection with
the sale of securities known as Timberwolf and Point Pleasant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basis Yield agreed that any disputes connected to the
investments would be subject to binding arbitration when it
opened its trading account, New York-based Goldman Sachs said in
court documents filed yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case should be dismissed if arbitration isn&#8217;t ordered
because it lacks a &#8220;substantial nexus&#8221; to New York, and
because the losses from the investments were caused by the
collapse of the mortgage market and not by misrepresentations,
Goldman Sachs said in the filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Not only are subjective opinions as to market direction
inactionable, but defendants had no crystal ball as to market
direction any more than did BYAFM or any other investor,&#8221;
Goldman Sachs said in the court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A June 2010 lawsuit by Basis Capital over the securities
was dismissed last year by U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones in
Manhattan, who ruled the Australian fund couldn&#8217;t use U.S.
securities laws to pursue its claims against Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Basis Yield Alpha Fund (Master) v. Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., 652996/2011, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the New
York-based bank that eliminated 2,400 jobs last year, reduced
its compensation and benefits expense 21 percent to
$12.2 billion in 2011 as revenue slid 26 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expense for salary, bonuses and benefits, the company&#8217;s
biggest cost, was enough to provide $367,057 to each of its
33,300 employees. That&#8217;s down from $430,700 for each of the
35,700 workers at the end of 2010, according to data provided
today in the firm&#8217;s fourth-quarter earnings statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which set a record for securities-firm pay
in 2007, reduced compensation for the third year in a row after
earnings skidded and protesters denounced Wall Street bonuses.
JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest and most profitable U.S. bank,
reported last week that it lowered pay at its investment bank 9
percent in 2011, enough to pay each worker an average $341,552. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Unless conditions really improve dramatically -- which I
think is unlikely -- you&#8217;re going to see a long period of
restrained wages, which we view favorably as shareholders,&#8221;
William Fitzpatrick, a Milwaukee-based financial-services
analyst at Manulife Asset Management, said before the results
were released. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The flip side is the risk that you start losing some
personnel, particularly to the hedge-fund industry,&#8221; said
Fitzpatrick, whose team oversees $800 million, including stock
in Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bulgarian lawmakers started debating
a ban on hydraulic fracturing today, threatening Chevron Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s
plans to explore shale gas deposits in the Balkan country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government withdrew a previously granted exploration
license from Chevron yesterday after hundreds of Bulgarians
marched in central Sofia last week to protest the drilling
technique known as fracking, fearing it will pollute the water
and soil in Bulgaria&#8217;s most fertile farm region of Dobrudja
where Chevron was planning to drill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulgaria would join France in banning the process, which
uses a mixture of water, sand and chemicals to open fissures in
shale rocks and release natural gas and oil. While fracking has
made the U.S the world&#8217;s largest natural-gas producer, it has
also raised concerns that the technique pollutes drinking water
and causes earthquakes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The protests show that people are not certain in the
benefits of this project,&#8221; Prime Minister Boiko Borissov said
during the Cabinet meeting yesterday. &#8220;We have to retract the
decision and start debates.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Ramon, California-based Chevron won a tender last May
to explore for natural gas in shale deposits in northeastern
Bulgaria, pledging to pay the government 30 million euros ($43
million). The company estimates it could extract as much as 25
billion cubic meters of gas in the region, almost six times
Bulgaria&#8217;s annual consumption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron could provide millions in investments in Bulgaria
and create jobs,&#8221; U.S. Ambassador to Bulgaria James Warlick
said in an interview with Nova television in Sofia today.
&#8220;Chevron has no other interests in Bulgaria besides shale gas
and would be forced to leave the country if its opportunities
are curbed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French Ban &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulgaria&#8217;s government also halted the process of issuing
permits to Texas-based Integrity Towers Inc. and Denver-based
oil producer Direct Petroleum Exploration Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;France was the first country in the world to outlaw
hydraulic fracturing of shale rocks last July. Last year
exploration was suspended in the German state of North Rhine-
Westphalia as well as in northwest England, where fracturing gas
wells caused two tremors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In eastern Europe, particularly Poland and the Ukraine,
fracking has been hailed as a means to reduce the countries&#8217;
dependence on Russian gas imports. Bulgaria may hold between 300
billion and 1 trillion cubic meters of shale gas, the Energy 
Economy Ministry estimated. The country consumes about 4 billion
cubic meters of gas a year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) lost another bid
before a U.S appeals court for an order blocking enforcement of
an Ecuadorean court&#8217;s $18 billion environmental damages verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, had asked a
panel of judges at the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York to set
aside its Sept. 19 ruling rejecting a trial judge&#8217;s decision in
March that blocked collection of the Ecuadorean judgment. The
company also asked for a rehearing on the merits of its appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a related decision, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan
this month refused Chevron&#8217;s request to restrain Ecuadorean
assets that could be seized as part of the Ecuadorean judgment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron was ordered on Feb. 14 to pay as much as $18
billion in compensatory and punitive damages for Texaco Inc.&#8217;s
alleged dumping of toxic drilling wastes in the Ecuadorean
jungle from 1964 to about 1992. The ruling came in an 18-year-
old lawsuit decided by a judge in Lago Agrio, a provincial
capital near the Colombian border. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Dumped&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karen Hinton, a spokeswoman for the plaintiffs, said that
Ecuadorean communities affected by the contamination &#8220;are one
step closer to justice as a result of today&#8217;s ruling.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For almost two decades, Chevron has stood in the way of a
comprehensive cleanup of billions of gallons of crude oil and
toxic waste water it deliberately dumped into the pristine
rainforest,&#8221; Hinton said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;Thousands
of people have died or suffered as the oil giant and its legions
of lawyers have fought to distract attention from the
overwhelming evidence against the company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Jan. 3, an Ecuadorean appeals court upheld the February
ruling &#8220;in all of its parts, including the conviction for moral
reparation or its alternative and costs,&#8221; according to the
decision. Chevron can appeal the decision to the next level of
Ecuador&#8217;s judiciary, a company spokesman said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full Opinion &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. appeals panel in September rejected Kaplan&#8217;s March
decision blocking collection of the Ecuadorean judgment pending
resolution of a lawsuit alleging that the plaintiffs engaged in
fraud to win the case. The appeals court hasn&#8217;t issued a full
opinion in the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron denies wrongdoing in the Lago Agrio lawsuit. The
company says Texaco cleaned up its share of the pollution at its
former oil fields, which were taken over by PetroEcuador,
Ecuador&#8217;s state-owned oil company. Chevron says it was released
from any future liability by an agreement between Texaco and
Ecuador. Chevron acquired Texaco in 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron filed a claim in 2009 against Ecuador in the
Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague seeking orders that
it has no liability for the environmental pollution and that
PetroEcuador should pay the damage award. In those proceedings,
Ecuador was told in February to prevent enforcement of the
judgment until further order by the tribunal, Chevron said on
Jan. 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Disappointed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron said it is disappointed with today&#8217;s decision and
awaits the court&#8217;s final ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron will also continue to prepare to resist any
efforts by the plaintiffs to enforce the judgment in other
countries in the event Ecuador chooses to defy the tribunal&#8217;s
order,&#8221; the company said in a statement. &#8220;Chevron has
uncovered overwhelming evidence of fraud and does not believe
that the Ecuador ruling is enforceable in any court that
observes the rule of law.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The San Ramon, California-based company alleged in a U.S.
suit before Kaplan that lawyers for the Ecuadoreans conspired to
fabricate evidence. Attorneys for the Latin American plaintiffs
said the lawsuit is an unjustified attempt to derail the
pollution lawsuit damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The racketeering case is Chevron v. Donziger, 11-00691,
U.S. District Court, District of New York (Manhattan). The case
in Ecuador is Maria Aquinda v. Chevron, 002-2003, Superior Court
of Nueva Loja, Lago Agrio, Ecuador. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider, forecast
2012 earnings exceeding analysts&#8217; estimates after fourth-quarter
profit rose 4.4 percent because of rising software demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings, excluding some items, will increase to at least
$14.85 a share this year, Armonk, New York-based IBM said today.
Analysts projected $14.81, the average of estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Fourth-quarter operating earnings advanced to $4.71 a
share, beating the $4.62 analysts predicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virginia &#8220;Ginni&#8221; Rometty succeeded Sam Palmisano this
month, becoming the first female chief executive officer in the
company&#8217;s 100-year history. She inherits a five-year plan that
includes boosting software to half of IBM&#8217;s earnings, with a
focus on programs that help businesses analyze and project
trends, as well as on cloud computing and emerging markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Software was a relative strength,&#8221; Shebly Seyrafi, an
analyst at FBN Securities in New York with a &#8220;sector perform&#8221;
rating on the stock, said in an interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s a bit
relieving that IBM, which is a bellwether in technology, did not
disappoint investors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales increased 1.6 percent to $29.5 billion, compared with
the $29.7 billion analysts had predicted. The euro declined 3.2
percent against the dollar last year amid Europe&#8217;s debt crisis.
The drop means revenue from Europe, which combined with Middle
East and Africa accounts for almost a third of IBM&#8217;s sales, is
worth less when converted to dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rometty&#8217;s Moves &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM gained as much as 3.9 percent to $187.50 in extended
trading, after closing at $180.52. The shares reached a record
in 2011 and rose 25 percent for the year. They had lost 1.8
percent this year as of today&#8217;s close. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rometty, 54, formerly IBM&#8217;s sales and marketing head, took
the helm Jan. 1 after the succession was announced in October.
Palmisano, who had been CEO since 2002, remains chairman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her first promotions this month, Rometty named Bruno Di Leo as sales and distribution chief and Bridget Van Kralingen as
head of consulting, replacing a retiring Frank Kern. She also
named James Bramante senior vice president of growth markets, an
elevated title as IBM seeks to boost the unit&#8217;s sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has set goals of adding $20 billion in new revenue,
including spending about $20 billion on acquisitions, from 2010
through 2015, as it expands offerings to business customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth Markets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter net income rose to $5.49 billion, or $4.62 a
share, from $5.26 billion, or $4.18 a share, a year earlier.
Operating earnings a year earlier were $4.25 a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit expansion this year will be &#8220;more skewed to the
second half,&#8221; Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on a
conference call today. IBM has said it targets annual operating
earnings of at least $20 a share by 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are well on track toward our long-term roadmap for
operating earnings,&#8221; Rometty said in the statement. &#8220;We
continued to realize the benefit of our long-term investments in
growth markets, business analytics, Smarter Planet solutions and
cloud.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales at IBM&#8217;s software unit rose about 9 percent to $7.6
billion, boosted by demand for brands such as Tivoli and Lotus.
Services revenue growth slowed to 3 percent from the third
quarter&#8217;s 8 percent, while hardware sales fell 8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backlog, which measures expected future revenue from
contracts, totaled $141 billion in the quarter, up $4 billion
from the third quarter. Contract signings for services, which
make up about 60 percent of IBM revenue, fell 8 percent from a
year earlier to $20.4 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Services revenue will rise at least 3 percent this year,
based on the backlog growth, Loughridge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to build our momentum in software,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Our services business delivered powerful margin and profit
growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from growth markets, such as Brazil, India and
China, increased 7 percent in the fourth quarter. Sales from the
regions will make up at least 30 percent of revenue by 2015, the
company has said, up from 22 percent in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft (MSFT) Corp., the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, reported second-quarter profit that beat
estimates, lifted by holiday sales of Xbox machines and Kinect
sensors, as well as corporate software demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income was $6.62 billion, or 78 cents a share, compared
with $6.63 billion, or 77 cents, a year earlier, Microsoft said
today in a statement. Sales rose to $20.9 billion, matching
estimates. Analysts had predicted 76 cents in profit on average,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox business got a boost from Christmas
shoppers, who snapped up its video-game consoles and Kinect
sensor controllers, and signed up for the Xbox Live online
service. That helped make up for Windows sales hurt by sluggish
demand for personal computers and a shortage of hard drives
stemming from floods in Thailand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Xbox looks strong and Xbox Live looks really strong,&#8221;
said Kim Caughey Forrest, an analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group
Inc., which owns Microsoft shares. Sales of Office programs also
performed well, she said. &#8220;Those were all good things to see.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares rose in extended trading after the report.
The stock, which declined 7 percent last year, had decreased
less than 1 percent to close at $28.12 in regular trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower Costs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also lowered its operating-cost projections. In
the fiscal year that began July 1, the expenses will be $28.5
billion to $28.9 billion, down from an October forecast for
$28.6 billion to $29.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unearned revenue, a measure of future sales, was $15.3
billion, above the $15.1 billion average estimate compiled by
Bloomberg. The category shows Microsoft continues to sign
multiyear agreements with corporate customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have some headwinds from a challenging PC market, but
Office and Server and Tools continue to grow very nicely,&#8221;
Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein said in an
interview. &#8220;Xbox and Xbox Live had another strong holiday
season.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The supply of computers to stores and companies was
hampered by flooding in Thailand, a disaster that wiped out
about a quarter of the world&#8217;s hard-drive manufacturing
capacity. That led PC shipments to decline 0.2 percent in the
fourth quarter, according to IDC, instead of the 5.1 percent
increase initially predicted. Gartner Inc., another research
firm, said PC shipments dropped 1.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Threat From IPad &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flooding compounded the woes of PCs, which are being
pushed off consumer wish lists in favor of smartphones and Apple
Inc.&#8217;s iPad. Heather Bellini, an analyst at Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., says Windows revenue is unlikely to recover substantially
in the next few quarters. The disk-drive shortage will continue
to hurt the industry, and customers are waiting for Microsoft&#8217;s
new Windows 8 before they buy PCs, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drive shortages and concerns about the economy are likely
to persist throughout the March quarter, Klein said. Microsoft
may have a hard time keeping some PC users from switching to
tablets and smartphones until Windows 8 goes on sale, he said.
Klein declined to provide a release date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to adding new PC features, Windows 8 will have
a touch-screen interface designed for tablets and will work with
ARM Holdings Plc chip technology. That will help manufacturers
produce machines that can rival the iPad in battery life and
speed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows Decline &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s Windows division posted a 6.3 percent decline
in sales to $4.74 billion last quarter, missing the $4.9 billion
estimated by analysts. Windows revenue has fallen short of
analysts&#8217; estimates in four of the past five quarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Business division&#8217;s sales, largely made up of Office
products such as Word and Excel, rose 2.8 percent to $6.28
billion. That beat the $6.1 billion average estimate of
analysts. Server and tools software was $4.77 billion, compared
with the $4.8 billion average estimate. The Xbox unit posted
sales of $4.24 billion, topping the projection of $4.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Xbox business had its best week ever in terms of U.S.
sales, setting a record during the seven days after
Thanksgiving. Microsoft has now sold a total of 66 million Xbox
machines and 18 million Kinect motion sensors, which let users
control games with body motion. Forty million customers have
signed up for the company&#8217;s Xbox Live online gaming and
entertainment service, the company said earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate Sales &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has relied on corporate demand for its Office and
server software, as well as business purchases of PCs, to shore
up earnings in recent quarters. Many business customers have
multiyear agreements with Microsoft, helping insulate the
company from quarterly fluctuations in demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Klein said the company hasn&#8217;t seen any weakness in
corporate demand and isn&#8217;t expecting that to change. Products
such as the SharePoint program for hosting websites and the Lync
software for messaging and teleconferencing are selling well
among businesses, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, corporate budgets for 2012 look to be
&#8220;conservative,&#8221; Bellini said in a note before the earnings
report. Outside of Germany, demand in Europe will be &#8220;soft,&#8221;
putting pressure on Microsoft&#8217;s corporate sales for the next few
quarters, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You have to be concerned about the corporate engine
running out of steam,&#8221; said Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at
Pacific Crest Securities in Portland, Oregon, who rates the
shares &#8220;sector perform.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Citigroup
Inc. (C) and Bank of America Corp. tapped the corporate bond market,
locking in reduced borrowing costs amid a rally in their debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs issued $4.5 billion of notes in its largest
offering since March 2009, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. New York-based Citigroup sold $1 billion of 30-year
bonds in its first sale of the debt in more than two years,
Bloomberg data show. Bank of America, the second-largest U.S.
lender, raised $1.5 billion in an offering of 10-year
debentures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial companies&#8217; bonds are enjoying their best
performance in back-to-back months in more than a year as
investors gain confidence that Europe&#8217;s sovereign-debt crisis
will be contained. Even as the fourth-quarter net income at
JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Citigroup dropped, the average cost to
protect debt of the largest U.S. banks using credit-default
swaps has fallen to the lowest since October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They all want to prove they have access to the market and
fewer people are buying into a &#8216;woe is me&#8217; catastrophe coming
out of Europe,&#8221; Michael Johnson, chief market strategist at the
Scottsdale, Arizona-based broker-dealer M.S. Howells  Co., said
in a telephone interview. &#8220;Investment-grade financial paper is
still cheap compared to other parts of the market, and that&#8217;s
pushing some buyers toward them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial Bond Yields &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on financial company bonds worldwide fell to 4.55
percent yesterday, the lowest since Nov. 8, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data. They have declined after
rising on Nov. 29 to 5.25 percent, the highest level since
August 2009, the index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate bonds issued by financial firms have returned 1.2
percent this month after gaining 2 percent in December, the best
performance in consecutive months since the period ended August
2010, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s $4.25 billion of 10-year, 5.75 percent
notes yield 380 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. The company sold $250 million
of additional 5.125 percent notes due in January 2015 at a
spread of 350 basis points. Goldman Sachs had $2.25 billion of
the debt outstanding after a January 2005 offering, Bloomberg
data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income in the fourth quarter decreased 58 percent to
$1.01 billion, the bank said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale was Goldman Sachs&#8217;s largest since it issued $5
billion of debt guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. on March 12, 2009, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Offering &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup&#8217;s $1 billion of 30-year, 5.875 percent bonds
yield 297 basis points more than Treasuries, Bloomberg data
show. Fourth-quarter profit fell 11 percent, missing analysts&#8217;
estimates for an increase, to $1.17 billion as trading revenue
declined, the bank said Jan. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America&#8217;s 10-year, 5.7 percent notes pay a spread
of 378 basis points, Bloomberg data show. The Charlotte, North
Carolina-based bank swung to a fourth-quarter profit as the
company sold assets and built capital faster than expected, it
said today in a statement. Net income was $1.99 billion compared
with a loss of $1.24 billion a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average of contracts on JPMorgan Chase, Bank of
America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo  Co., Goldman Sachs and Morgan
Stanley fell to 235 basis points yesterday, the lowest since
touching 222.5 basis points on Oct. 28, according to the data
provider CMA. Credit-default swaps, which investors use to hedge
against losses on the company&#8217;s debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and
Citigroup Inc. (C) are marketing $1 billion of commercial-mortgage
bonds with lower relative yields than the most recent deals as
demand for the debt recovers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A top-ranked public portion maturing in about 10 years may
yield 110 basis points more than the benchmark swap rate,
according to a person familiar with the offering who declined to
be identified because terms aren&#8217;t set. Bonds rated BBB-, being
offered privately, may pay a spread of 700 basis points more
than the benchmark, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS AG and Citigroup sold similar top-ranked debt to yield
130 basis points more than swaps in December, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman
Sachs, and Scott Helfman, a spokesman for Citigroup, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relative yields on commercial mortgage bonds determine how
attractive Wall Street rates are for property owners and drive
the velocity of new offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spread on top-ranked commercial-mortgage bonds was as
narrow as 60 basis points more than Treasuries when sales peaked
in 2007, and as wide as 14.92 percentage points in November 2008
in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks pulled back from making new loans to package into
bonds in July as Europe&#8217;s debt crisis roiled credit markets and
sent spreads soaring. Originations have since picked up,
according to a Standard  Poor&#8217;s report last month. The ratings
company is forecasting $35 billion in 2012 sales. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jefferson County (3681MF), Alabama, won
permission to review a settlement between JPMorgan Chase  Co.
and an investor who sued the bank for fraud related to the
county&#8217;s defaulted sewer bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Thomas B. Bennett in Birmingham
approved a request by the county to question the investor, James
R. Crane, and to review the settlement that ended his lawsuit
against JPMorgan, which underwrote the bonds. Bennett ordered
Crane to appear at the Houston offices of his law firm to answer
questions about the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The county is seeking information to use in its own lawsuit
against New York-based JPMorgan. Now that Crane has settled, the
county said it is concerned information he collected as part of
his case may be thrown away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If such information is discarded, destroyed or otherwise
lost, the county may be unable to obtain the documents,&#8221; the
county said in its request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferson County filed for bankruptcy in November after the
county, state officials and bondholders failed to implement a
tentative agreement to reduce its $3 billion in sewer debt by
about $1 billion, raise rates and win financial support from the
Alabama state legislature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Jefferson County, 11-05736-9, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Alabama (Birmingham). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Montagu Private Equity LLP, the
London-based buyout firm spun off from HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA),
appointed its former parent company and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
to manage the sale of the German bandages-supplier BSN Medical,
three people familiar with the decision said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An auction to sell the Hamburg-based company is scheduled
to start in the next few weeks, said the people, who declined to
be identified because the process is private. The disposal of
BSN may fetch about 2 billion euros ($2.6 billion), other people
said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Montagu, which manages a 2.5 billion euro buyout fund and
which split from HSBC in 2003, has been looking to dispose of
the German medical equipment company for more than three years.
In 2008, it hired Morgan Stanley to lead a review, which
included a possible initial public offering or a sale, people
with knowledge of the plan said at the time. The firm bought BSN
in 2006 for about 1 billion euros, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BSN makes general wound-care and orthopedics products, and
has operations in 25 countries with about 3,400 staff, according
to Montagu&#8217;s website. It had revenue of 526 million euros in
2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sky News reported earlier today that Montagu had chosen the
two banks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seven men, including fund managers
and analysts, were charged by the U.S. with forming a &#8220;criminal
club&#8221; of friends and co-workers who reaped almost $62 million
from insider trading in Dell Inc. (DELL) shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara alleged that the
scheme included one trade that earned a $53 million illegal
windfall for Level Global Investors LP co-founder Anthony
Chiasson and his fund. The insider-trading ring, which involved
five different hedge funds and investment firms, is the largest
identified by the U.S. to date to involve a single stock,
federal authorities said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiasson, Todd Newman, a portfolio manager formerly at
Diamondback Capital Management LLC, Jon Horvath, a hedge fund
analyst in New York, and Danny Kuo, a fund manager for Whittier
Trust Co. in South Pasadena, California, were taken into federal
custody yesterday, said Janice Fedarcyk, head of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation&#8217;s New York office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charges &#8220;paint a stunning portrait of organized
corruption on a grand scale,&#8221; Bharara said yesterday at a news
conference. &#8220;It describes a circle of friends who essentially
formed a criminal club, whose purpose was profit and whose
members regularly bartered lucrative inside information. It was
a club where everyone scratched everyone else&#8217;s back.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. said the illegal profits earned as a result of the
scheme were almost of the same &#8220;magnitude of fraud we proved in
the Galleon Group insider trading scheme,&#8221; Bharara said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Khuzami, the head of enforcement at the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, which filed a related suit
yesterday against the defendants, said the cases describe
actions &#8220;far more disturbing&#8221; than insider trading committed
by someone who obtains one illegal tip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horvath, 42, is an analyst at Connecticut-based hedge fund
Sigma Capital Management LLC, said a person with knowledge of
the matter who wasn&#8217;t authorized to speak because the
information wasn&#8217;t public. He was arrested by the FBI yesterday
at his home in Manhattan, the U.S. said, and released on a
$750,000 bond after a court appearance before U.S. Magistrate
Judge James Cott in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Throughout a more than 10-year career as a respected
investment analyst, Jon Horvath has conducted himself with
honesty and integrity,&#8221; Horvath&#8217;s lawyer, Steven Peikin, said
after court. &#8220;He has done nothing wrong,&#8217;&#8221; and the charges
against him  &#8220;will be shown to be meritless,&#8221; Peikin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg Morvillo, Chiasson&#8217;s lawyer, argued that client trades
made by others at Level Global were attributing to his client. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newman, 47, was released on a $3 million bond after
appearing in U.S. District Court in Boston yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuo, 36, who was arrested yesterday in California, was
released on $300,000 bond after appearing in federal court in
Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Goldberg, a spokesman for New York-based Level
Global, didn&#8217;t return a call seeking comment on the arrests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diamondback, in a letter to investors yesterday, said it
has cooperated with U.S. authorities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Neiman, of Wilmer Hale, a lawyer for Diamondback
Capital, declined to comment on the SEC lawsuit. MaryJeanette
Dee, a lawyer for Level Global, didn&#8217;t return a voice-mail
message left at her office seeking comment on the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. Newman, 12-00124, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The

&lt;p&gt;Treasury Code Stolen by New York Fed Programmer, U.S. Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Treasury Department software used to track federal
collections and payments was stolen by a government contractor&#8217;s
employee who worked at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,
federal prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bo Zhang, 32, who worked for an unidentified technology
company, was a computer programmer assigned to work on source
code at the New York Fed from May until August, the U.S. said in
a criminal complaint against him that was unsealed yesterday in
federal court in Manhattan. Zhang is a Chinese citizen, said a
person with knowledge of the matter who didn&#8217;t want to be
identified because the information wasn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software system relates to the &#8220;tracking of the
billions of dollars that are electronically transferred every
day in the U.S.&#8217;s general ledger,&#8221; prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zhang has been in the U.S. on a work visa since 2000, said
another person familiar with the matter who also didn&#8217;t want to
be identified because the information isn&#8217;t public. Zhang worked
previously at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Bank of America
Corp., the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Magistrate Judge James Cott yesterday agreed to
release Zhang on a $200,000 bond secured by a condominium
located in the Flushing, Queens, section of New York City. Cott
ordered that he surrender all of his travel documents and
restricted his movements to parts of New York and to New Jersey,
where Zhang&#8217;s lawyer said his client works. Cott set the next
court appearance in the case for Feb. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After court yesterday, Zhang&#8217;s lawyer, Joseph Grob,
declined to comment on the charges or whether his client is a
citizen of China or a naturalized U.S. citizen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt Anderson, a Treasury spokesman, said the department
has worked to strengthen security procedures for Federal Reserve
contractors working on Financial Management Service projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There was no compromise of any transaction data, personal
identifying information or federal funds,&#8221; Anderson said in an
e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Zhang, 12-mag-00108, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HUD, DOJ to Meet With States for Support on Foreclosure Deal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan
and a Justice Department official are set to meet with state
attorneys general next week to rally support for a proposed
settlement with banks over foreclosure practices, said a
spokesman for Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials about the proposed deal are being sent to all
states, and Democratic attorneys general have been invited to
meet on Monday with Miller, Donovan and Associate Attorney
General Thomas Perrelli, said Geoff Greenwood, Miller&#8217;s
spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State and federal officials have been negotiating a
settlement with the five largest mortgage servicers, including
Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), which would set
requirements for conducting foreclosures and provide relief to
homeowners. Miller, a Democrat, has been leading negotiations
for the states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorneys general from all 50 states announced in 2010 they
were investigating bank foreclosure practices after disclosures
that the companies were using faulty documents in seizing homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting, planned for Chicago, comes after about a dozen
state attorneys general met last week to discuss their mortgage
probes and how they might work together during settlement talks,
people familiar with the matter said last week. At Monday&#8217;s
meeting, the federal and state officials will answer questions
and discuss details of the potential deal in an effort to win
support, Greenwood said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group included New York Attorney General Eric
Schneiderman, California Attorney General Kamala Harris and
others who have said any deal shouldn&#8217;t protect banks from
mortgage-related investigations that haven&#8217;t yet been resolved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harris and Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto
announced in December they were collaborating in their mortgage
and foreclosure investigations. Schneiderman and Delaware
Attorney General Beau Biden are also cooperating. In December,
Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley sued Charlotte,
North Carolina-based Bank of America, New York-based JPMorgan,
Citigroup Inc. (C), Wells Fargo  Co. and Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY),
accusing them of conducting unlawful foreclosures and deceiving
homeowners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HUD spokesman Derrick L. Plummer declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asks for Arbitration in Basis Yield Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. asked a New York state court judge
to order arbitration in a lawsuit against the investment bank by
Basis Yield Alpha Fund or dismiss the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basis Yield Alpha Fund, a unit of Australian hedge fund
Basis Capital Funds Management Ltd., sued Goldman Sachs in New
York State Supreme Court in October, accusing the bank of making
false and misleading statements and omissions in connection with
the sale of securities known as Timberwolf and Point Pleasant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basis Yield agreed that any disputes connected to the
investments would be subject to binding arbitration when it
opened its trading account, New York-based Goldman Sachs said in
court documents filed Jan. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case should be dismissed if arbitration isn&#8217;t ordered
because it lacks a &#8220;substantial nexus&#8221; to New York, and
because the losses from the investments were caused by the
collapse of the mortgage market and not by misrepresentations,
Goldman Sachs said in the filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Not only are subjective opinions as to market direction
inactionable, but defendants had no crystal ball as to market
direction any more than did BYAFM or any other investor,&#8221;
Goldman Sachs said in the court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A June 2010 lawsuit by Basis Capital over the securities
was dismissed last year by U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones in
Manhattan, who ruled the Australian fund couldn&#8217;t use U.S.
securities laws to pursue its claims against Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Basis Yield Alpha Fund (Master) v. Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., 652996/2011, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlyle Seeks to Ban Shareholder Lawsuits Before Public Offering &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlyle Group LP, the Washington-based buyout company
that&#8217;s preparing to go public, is seeking to bar its future
shareholders from filing individual and class-action lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm revised its governing documents last week to say
that investors who purchase company shares must settle any
subsequent claims against Carlyle through arbitration in
Wilmington, Delaware. That could limit the ability of
stockholders to win big awards for securities-law violations
such as fraud, Bloomberg News&#8217;s Miles Weiss reported that
several attorneys said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court (1000L) has issued a series of rulings in
recent years upholding the right of companies to require the use
of arbitration to resolve disputes with consumers. Carlyle is
seeking to extend this principle to public shareholders, a move
that could run up against a bedrock of U.S. securities law, the
ability of investors to seek redress in federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What we are talking about is legally uncharted
territory,&#8221; said Donald Langevoort, a law professor at
Georgetown University in Washington who previously worked for
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. &#8220;I would be
surprised if the courts allow any company to entirely foreclose
shareholder rights to sue under federal securities laws.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Ullman, a spokesman for Carlyle, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At issue are provisions of U.S. securities laws that bar
investors from waiving their rights to seek damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC must approve Carlyle&#8217;s registration statement
before the private-equity firm can sell shares to the public.
The agency has historically refused to permit a public offering
by a company whose charter mandates arbitration and precludes
class actions, John Coffee, a professor at Columbia Law School
in New York, said in an e-mail response to questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlyle may be considered different because it&#8217;s a limited
partnership rather than a corporation, Coffee said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It will be a difficult precedent to contain if the SEC
permits this,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florence Harmon, a spokeswoman for the SEC, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financial Guaranty Suits Against Ally Moved to U.S. Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial Guaranty Insurance Co. lawsuits against Ally
Financial Inc. (ALLY) over soured mortgage loans backing securities
sold to investors were moved to federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial Guaranty filed two lawsuits against Ally
Financial in New York state Supreme Court in Manhattan on Dec.
27, accusing Ally&#8217;s Residential Funding unit of making
&#8220;material misrepresentations&#8221; about the loans, which Financial
Guaranty said were riskier than promised. Ally said there was
&#8220;no merit&#8221; to it being named in the complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases were moved to U.S. District Court in Manhattan on
Jan. 13, according to court documents filed in New York state
Supreme Court yesterday. Three other lawsuits filed by Financial
Guaranty against Ally Financial units in November were removed
to U.S. District Court earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FGIC Corp., the holding company for Financial Guaranty
Insurance Co., sought bankruptcy protection from creditors in
August 2010 after suffering losses from the drop in the U.S.
housing market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Financial Guaranty Insurance Co. v. Ally
Financial Inc., 653621-2011, and Financial Guaranty Insurance
Co. v. Ally Financial, 653623-2011, New York state Supreme Court
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JJ Hid 3 Risperdal Diabetes Studies From FDA, Texas Jury Told &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) officials hid three studies showing some
patients using Risperdal developed diabetes while claiming the
antipsychotic drug didn&#8217;t cause the disease, a witness
testified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As early as 1999, Johnson  Johnson&#8217;s Janssen unit had
researchers&#8217; findings that about half the patients taking
Risperdal in a study comparing its risks to those of Eli Lilly 
Co.&#8217;s Zyprexa antipsychotic drug developed diabetes after a year
on the medication, Joseph Glenmullen, a psychiatrist and Harvard
Medical School instructor, told a Texas jury yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That study concluded Risperdal caused &#8220;medically serious
weight gain&#8221; that led study subjects to develop diabetes,
Glenmullen testified in the trial of the state of Texas&#8217;s
lawsuit over Janssen&#8217;s marketing of the drug. At the same time,
Janssen salespeople were telling doctors that researchers
concluded the drug didn&#8217;t cause the disease, Glenmullen added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas contends New Brunswick, New Jersey-based JJ, the
world&#8217;s largest health-care products company, defrauded the
Medicaid program by promoting Risperdal for uses not approved by
U.S. regulators, including for children with psychiatric
disorders, and misleading doctors and regulators about the
drug&#8217;s risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state joined a lawsuit filed by a whistle-blower, Allen
Jones, a former Pennsylvania health-care fraud investigator.
Lawyers for Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott are asking jurors
in state court in Austin, Texas, to order JJ and Janssen to pay
at least $579 million in damages over the companies&#8217; Risperdal
marketing practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Clements, a Janssen spokesman, didn&#8217;t return a call
for comment yesterday on Glenmullen&#8217;s testimony about the
company&#8217;s handling of the studies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glenmullen, testifying as an expert for the state, told
jurors Janssen officials didn&#8217;t turn over Study 113, which found
Risperdal posed a higher diabetes risk than Zyprexa, to the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration when regulators began probing links
between anti-psychotic medications and the disease in 2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker also didn&#8217;t turn over the results of two
other later studies that found Risperdal and Zyprexa posed
comparable diabetes risks to the FDA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Texas v. Janssen LP, D-1GV-04-001288, District
Court, Travis County, Texas (Austin). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julius Baer Said to Recover $43.8 Million in Singapore Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER) won a bid in Singapore to recover
34.1 million euros ($43.8 million) from LonGains Investment Pte
for a trade involving credit-linked notes, according to two
people familiar with the dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switzerland&#8217;s biggest publicly traded private bank won the
ruling at Singapore&#8217;s High Court last week, said the people, who
weren&#8217;t authorized to speak publicly about the decision. Minutes
from the Jan. 11 closed hearing aren&#8217;t publicly available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LonGains, a Singapore-based commodities investor and
trader, had no money in its Euro and U.S. dollar accounts when
it placed the trade in August on notes issued by BNP Paribas SA,
and linked to Commerzbank AG (CBK), according to Julius Baer&#8217;s Sept.
27 lawsuit. That triggered a 34.1 million euro overdraft, the
bank said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re going to appeal the decision,&#8221; LonGains director
Magindra Raw Manian said on Jan. 18. He declined to confirm the
value of the notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tresor Anne Tan, a Singapore-based spokeswoman at Julius
Baer, declined to comment on litigation matters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s a &#8220;straightforward claim for money lent and unpaid
fees,&#8221; Michael Georg Gerny, head of legal products and services
at Julius Baer, said in a Dec. 7 court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bank Julius Baer v LonGains Investment Pte
S668/2011 in the Singapore High Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TD Bank Loses $67 Million Verdict Over Rothstein Fraud Role &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) lost a $67 million jury verdict over
claims it helped Scott Rothstein, the convicted Florida
attorney, in his $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme by telling victims
their money was safe as he depleted accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A jury in federal court in Miami returned the verdict
yesterday, in a lawsuit brought by Coquina Investments, based in
Corpus Christi, Texas. The panel deliberated about four hours
before reaching its verdict and notified U.S. District Judge
Marcia Cooke. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was clear cut for us,&#8221; the jury forewoman, Shonda
Smith, said after the verdict. &#8220;We were all surprised at how
much stuff they allowed to go through, all the deposits and
transfers. At any point, someone could have stopped it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coquina&#8217;s lawyer David Mandel on Jan. 17 urged the jury to
award $32 million in compensatory damages and $140 million in
punitive damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They didn&#8217;t lift a finger,&#8221; Mandel said in closing
arguments. &#8220;Once fraud was evident, it was their obligation to
report it and stop it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman, Rebecca Acevedo, said the bank is
disappointed with the verdict &#8220;and is considering all of its
options.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We still maintain that we were Rothstein Rosenfeldt
Adler&#8217;s bank and that it was Scott Rothstein who defrauded
investors,&#8221; she said by e-mail, referring to the confidence
man&#8217;s law firm. &#8220;We will continue to defend the bank against
claims of wrongdoing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s verdict was for $32 million in compensatory
damages and $35 million in punitive damages, the type designed
to punish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Coquina Investments v. Rothstein, 0:10-
cv-60786, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida
(Miami). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stryker Biotech Agrees to Plead Guilty to Misbranding Charge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Stryker Corp. (SYK) unit agreed to plead guilty and pay a $15
million fine while the medical-device maker was on trial on
charges it marketed an unapproved mixture of products for
strengthening human bone growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit, Stryker Biotech, and three Stryker sales
representatives were on trial in federal court in Boston on a
13-count criminal indictment claiming conspiracy and wire fraud.
The trial began Jan. 9 with jury selection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stryker Biotech agreed to plead to one misdemeanor count of
misbranding a medical device, according to a letter dated
yesterday from the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office in Boston and filed
with the federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors agreed to drop the case against Hopkinton,
Massachusetts-based Stryker Biotech and won&#8217;t call Stryker Corp.
President Stephen P. MacMillan to testify &#8220;in connection with
current or future trial proceedings&#8221; in the case before Judge
George O&#8217;Toole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government dropped charges Jan. 17 against former
regional sales manager David Ard of California, according to a
motion filed by prosecutors. Attorneys for former national sales
representative William Heppner of Illinois and ex-regional
manager Jeffrey Whitaker of North Carolina have asked the judge
to declare a mistrial. Mark Philip, former chief executive
officer of Stryker Biotech from 2004 to 2008, is scheduled to go
to trial later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Stryker Biotech LLC, 09-cr-10330, U.S.
District Court, District of Massachusetts (Boston). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Columbus Hill Capital CFO Admits Embezzling $10.4 Million &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former chief financial officer of Columbus Hill Capital
Management LP, an investment management firm based in Short
Hills, New Jersey, pleaded guilty to embezzling more than $10.4
million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Newmark, 39, admitted in federal court in Newark, New
Jersey, that he created a phony account to collect deposits that
he stole from the company. Newmark, who pleaded guilty to wire
fraud and tax evasion, agreed to forfeit $10.4 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Making personal use of company cash, it was only a matter
of time before he was caught with his hand in the piggy bank,&#8221;
U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newmark, of Towaco, New Jersey, faces as many as 20 years
in prison on the fraud charge and five years on the tax evasion
count. U.S. District Judge William Walls set sentencing for
April 24. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newmark&#8217;s attorney, Michael Himmel, didn&#8217;t immediately
return a call seeking comment on the plea. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Docket &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allen Stanford Loses Bid to Delay Jan. 23 Fraud Trial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R. Allen Stanford lost a bid to delay his $7 billion fraud
trial after a federal judge refused to wait until a digital
forensics expert on the defense team recovers from a medical
emergency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jury selection will begin as scheduled on Jan. 23,
according to court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An employee of Accumyn Consulting, which is providing
Stanford&#8217;s defense team with digital forensics and electronic-
discovery management services, was diagnosed with an illness
that will prevent her from working for at least three weeks,
U.S. District Judge David Hittner told lawyers at a hearing
yesterday in federal court in Houston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are many, many other employees at Accumyn,&#8221;
Hittner said, rejecting the defense&#8217;s request for a three-week
delay. When Stanford&#8217;s attorneys tried to debate the matter,
Hittner cut them off. &#8220;That&#8217;s it. I&#8217;ve ruled,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford, 61, has been imprisoned as a flight risk since
his June 2009 indictment on charges he defrauded investors
through allegedly bogus certificates of deposit at his Antigua-
based Stanford International Bank. Stanford denies all
wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford entered a plea of &#8220;not guilty&#8221; yesterday when
Hittner re-arraigned him on a 14-count superseding indictment
that was handed down while Stanford was in an out-of-state
prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hittner previously refused repeated requests by Stanford&#8217;s
court-appointed attorneys to delay the former financier&#8217;s trial
to give them more time to prepare. Stanford&#8217;s lawyers failed to
convince Hittner that time and budget constraints imposed by the
court infringed on their client&#8217;s constitutional right to an
adequate defense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. Stanford, 09-cr-342, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston). The SEC
case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Stanford
International Bank, 09-cv-298, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of Texas (Dallas). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Merrill Lynch, a
unit of Bank of America Corp., hired a structured product
specialist in Tokyo from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yuichiro Shinozaki joined the bank this month as a director
in charge of developing and structuring equity investments,
Tsukasa Noda, a spokesman in Tokyo at Merrill Lynch Japan
Securities Co., a unit of the Charlotte, North Carolina-based
lender, said by phone today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miyako Takebe, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in Tokyo,
declined to comment on staff moves when reached by phone today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America also hired Masahiro Oshige, previously at
Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), as a managing director in charge of
equity product sales, Noda said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isamu Kajino, a spokesman for Credit Suisse in Tokyo, said
in an e-mail today that Oshige had been head of equity
derivatives before leaving the firm last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shinozaki and Oshige started with Bank of America on Jan.
4, Noda said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these two hires, Bank of America wants to strengthen
its structuring capabilities for clients including third party
distributors, according to Noda. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structured notes are securities created by banks, which
package debt with derivatives to offer customized bets to
investors while earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are
contracts whose value is derived from stocks, bonds, currencies
and commodities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects year in last paragraph.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) awarded Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon about the same amount for 2011 as
the $23 million he received for the previous year, according to
a person with knowledge of the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person asked not to be identified because Dimon&#8217;s total
compensation for 2011 hasn&#8217;t been announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Dawn Kopecki and Michael J. Moore" date="Jan 20, 2012  7:09 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-20/jpmorgan-trims-dimon-s-stock-payout.html"><headline>JPMorgan Trims Dimon&#8217;s Stock Payout</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. left Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon&#8217;s pay package for 2011 almost
unchanged at about $23 million after trimming stock and options
awards, according to a person with knowledge of the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the largest and most profitable U.S. bank, paid
Dimon $17.3 million in restricted stock and options for 2011,
down from $17.4 million for 2010, including 337,032 restricted
shares valued at about $12.3 million, according to regulatory
filings today by the New York-based company. The package awarded
562,430 options valued by the firm at about $5 million,
according to the person, who asked for anonymity because
compensation matters are confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, 55, led JPMorgan through the financial crisis
without recording a single losing quarter and surpassed Bank of
America Corp. last year as the largest U.S. lender. Net income
advanced 9 percent to a record $19 billion in 2011, while the
stock dropped 20 percent including dividends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total compensation for the year is expected to be about the
same as 2010, the person said. Dimon may also receive a cash
bonus for 2011 that hasn&#8217;t yet been disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact total of his stock payout may differ and will be
disclosed when the company files its proxy statement later this
year. Dimon&#8217;s restricted stock may be worth as little as $12
million based on the average price of $35.61 on Jan. 18,
according to the person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A $500,000 Raise &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board raised his annual base pay for 2011 in March to
$1.5 million from $1 million. Dimon also received options
proceeds on Jan. 19 of $195,869 and sold $4 million in shares on
Jan. 13 as part of a regularly scheduled sale to cover taxes on
restricted stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon took the $1 million salary and gave up bonuses for
2008 -- the year when the financial crisis nearly toppled the
banking system -- after receiving $49.9 million in total
compensation for 2007, which included cash and restricted stock
bonuses of $14.5 million each. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon was paid $15.2 million for his work in 2009,
according to the bank&#8217;s calculations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) will stick with a
smaller board for now following the death of Steve Jobs, its
largest stockholder, and two departures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, proposed 10 current
directors for re-election at the company&#8217;s annual meeting set
for Tuesday, March 13, in Kansas City, Missouri, according to a
regulatory filing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s biggest theme park operator is preparing for
the departure of Chairman John E. Pepper, 73, who plans to hand
over that role to Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger at the
meeting. Iger will hold both titles as part of the company&#8217;s
plan to appoint a new CEO in 2015. Iger, 60, received 2011
compensation of $33.4 million, up from $29.6 million a year
earlier, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, also owner of the ABC broadcast network and the
ESPN cable channel, fell 0.3 percent to $39.31 in New York
trading. The shares were little changed last year. John Bryson
left the board in October to become U.S. Commerce Secretary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Steven P. Jobs trust owns 137.3 million Disney shares,
or almost 8 percent of the total, according the filing. The
shares are worth $5.4 billion. Previous filings listed him as
holding 138 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger&#8217;s 2011 pay included almost $2 million in salary, stock
awards of $8.1 million, option awards of $4.8 million and a
bonus of $15.5 million. A change in the value of his pension
contributed $2.07 million and other pay added almost $1 million
to the total. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, Disney raised its annual dividend by 50
percent to 60 cents a share, the biggest increase in at least 20
years, after the company reported record fiscal 2011 revenue and
profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Iger, those up for election are: Susan Arnold, John Chen, Judith Estrin, Fred Langhammer, Aylwin Lewis,
Monica Lozano, Robert Matschullat, Sheryl Sandberg and Orin Smith. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most U.S. stocks rose, erasing a
loss for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index in the final minutes of
trading, as banks gained and results from International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM) to Intel Corp. (INTC) boosted technology shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) added at
least 1.1 percent. IBM, Intel and Microsoft Corp. rose more than
2.9 percent as results beat projections. General Electric Co.
closed unchanged, rebounding from a 2.5 percent slump, as profit
topped estimates while sales were curbed by Europe. Google Inc. (GOOG)
tumbled 8.4 percent as earnings missed projections. American
Express Co. slid 1.8 percent on lower-than-forecast sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven stocks gained for every five falling on U.S.
exchanges at 4 p.m. New York time. The SP 500 rose 0.1 percent
to 1,315.38, extending its gain since Jan. 13 to 2 percent. The
index rose for a third week, capping the longest streak since
October. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 96.50 points,
or 0.8 percent, to 12,720.48. IBM (INDU), which comprises 11 percent of
the share-price weighted Dow, added 60.55 points to the index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a mixed bag of earnings,&#8221; Bruce Bittles, chief
investment strategist at Milwaukee-based Robert W. Baird  Co.,
which oversees $85 billion, said in a telephone interview.
&#8220;Earnings growth is going to decline, but that&#8217;s already built
into the market to a certain extent. If earnings don&#8217;t collapse,
it won&#8217;t be a problem.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP 500 companies, which beat profit estimates in the
previous 11 quarters, will report a 3.4 percent increase in per-
share earnings during the September-December period, analysts&#8217;
forecasts compiled by Bloomberg show. Of the 51 companies in the
SP 500 that reported results since Jan. 9, 33 posted per-share
earnings that beat projections, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic Data &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales (ETSLTOTL) of previously owned U.S. homes rose for a third month
in December to the highest level since January 2011, a sign the
housing market ended last year with momentum. Greek officials
and private creditors entered a third day of negotiations on a
debt swap deal that&#8217;s crucial to lowering the country&#8217;s
borrowings and freeing up a second round of international aid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial shares had the biggest gain among 10 SP 500
groups, adding 0.7 percent. JPMorgan rose 1.2 percent to $37.36.
Bank of America advanced 1.6 percent to $7.07. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The upturn is around the corner,&#8221; Chris Hyzy, the New
York-based chief investment officer at U.S. Trust Co., which
oversees about $325 billion, said in a telephone interview. The
rebound in banks &#8220;is a good sign. The financials have become a
more stable sector. That&#8217;s the first sign that within six to
nine months you could start to see the turnabout in the
financial sector.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM gained 4.4 percent to $188.52 after forecasting 2012
earnings that beat analysts&#8217; estimates as fourth-quarter profit
rose 4.4 percent because of rising software demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel, Microsoft (MSFT) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel increased 2.9 percent to $26.38. The chipmaker
predicted first-quarter revenue that may top analysts&#8217;
estimates, signaling that the shortage of disk drives that
throttled personal computer production may be ending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft added 5.7 percent to $29.71. The company&#8217;s Xbox
business got a boost from Christmas shoppers, who snapped up its
video-game consoles and Kinect sensor controllers, and signed up
for the Xbox Live online service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; GE (GE) closed unchanged at $19.15. Profit topped estimates
after the company&#8217;s industrial order backlog rose to a record
$200 billion even as weaker demand in Europe hindered sales in
health care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google tumbled 8.4 percent to $585.99. Chief Executive
Officer Larry Page is moving into new markets to ignite growth
outside Google&#8217;s traditional search-based business. That effort
contributed to an 8 percent drop in the average price Google
gets when users click an ad, because it charges less for ads on
mobile devices and in emerging markets, said Herman Leung, an
analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Express (AXP) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Express lost 1.8 percent to $50.04. The company
reported fourth-quarter revenue of $7.74 billion, missing the
average analyst projection of $7.9 billion, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Profit excluding some items beat analysts&#8217;
estimates as card spending reached a record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) slumped 5.6 percent to $46.03.
The credit-card issuer seeking approval to purchase ING Groep
NV&#8217;s U.S. online bank said fourth-quarter profit fell 42 percent
as expenses rose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) sank 2.9 percent to $13.17. Ohio&#8217;s
largest lender reported fourth-quarter sales of $1.46 billion,
missing the average analyst estimate of $1.52 billion, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks are caught in &#8220;a vicious circle&#8221; of slower
trading and bigger swings in prices, according to Pierre Lapointe, Brockhouse  Cooper Inc.&#8217;s global macro strategist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowest Since 2008 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading for the 50 days ended yesterday was the slowest
since at least 2008, when Bloomberg started compiling the data,
at 6.67 billion shares a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar averages for companies in the SP 500 and the Dow
declined this week to the lowest levels since 1999 and 2000,
respectively, according to Bloomberg&#8217;s figures. They reflect
trading totals for each stock on the New York Stock Exchange (MVOLNE) or
Nasdaq Stock Market, depending on where it&#8217;s listed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Getting in or out of a stock causes more price
variation&#8221; because fewer shares are trading, Lapointe and Alex Bellefleur, a financial economist, wrote yesterday in a report
from their Montreal-based firm. &#8220;This increases volatility.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or the
VIX, closed above 20 for almost six months before dropping below
the threshold yesterday. The time period was the longest for the
benchmark gauge of U.S. stock options since 2009. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donald R. Mullen Jr., who runs the
global credit and mortgage business at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS),
is leaving after 11 years at the firm, becoming the seventh
member of the management committee to depart in a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mullen, 53, will become a senior director at the New York-
based firm, according to an internal memo obtained today by
Bloomberg News. Michael DuVally, a company spokesman, confirmed
the memo&#8217;s contents and said Mullen&#8217;s successor hasn&#8217;t been
announced yet. Senior directors advise the firm on matters
related to their areas of expertise and aren&#8217;t employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, said
this week that fourth-quarter profit fell 58 percent, capping
the firm&#8217;s worst earnings year since 2008. The company said its
credit and mortgage businesses struggled in the fourth quarter
even as revenue from commodities and foreign exchange improved.
The firm doesn&#8217;t provide revenue figures for those departments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Credit and mortgages remained challenging as activity
levels declined across most products and a divergence between
cash and derivative pricing impacted hedging and inventory
management,&#8221; David A. Viniar, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s chief financial
officer, told analysts on a Jan. 18 conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The memo to employees was signed by Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd C. Blankfein, 57, and Chief Operating Officer Gary D. Cohn, 51. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s mortgage business, which outperformed
rivals in 2007, lost money in 2008. Goldman Sachs paid $550
million in 2010 to settle a lawsuit filed by the Securities and
Exchange Commission that accused the firm of misleading
investors on a mortgage-linked investment in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Departures &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mullen&#8217;s departure follows last week&#8217;s retirement by Edward K. Eisler, 42, and David B. Heller, 44, who were two of the four
co-heads of securities trading and also members of the
management committee. Other recent management committee
departures include Yusuf A. Alireza, who was co-president of the
Asia business; Edward C. Forst, who was co-head of the
investment management division; Kevin W. Kennedy, who supervised
the business in Latin America; and Richard M. Ruzika, who ran
the firm&#8217;s special-situations group before leaving at the end of
April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before joining Goldman Sachs as a partner in 2001, Mullen
was the head of credit and a board member at Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
smaller rival, Bear Stearns Cos. Prior to Bear Stearns, which
almost collapsed in March 2008 before being taken over by
JPMorgan Chase  Co., Mullen held senior positions in high-yield
sales for Salomon Brothers Inc., now part of Citigroup Inc. (C),
First Boston, now part of Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), and Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., which failed in 1990. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mullen didn&#8217;t immediately reply to a message left with his
office at Goldman Sachs. DuVally said Mullen declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mullen&#8217;s departure was reported earlier today by Reuters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. hired Marc Granetz, Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)&#8217;s former chairman of investment
banking, to lead a new unit for global finance initiatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granetz, 55, will report to Chief Financial Officer Doug Braunstein, according to a memo sent to employees of the New
York-based bank today. His group will work with executives and
businesses across JPMorgan on &#8220;critical issues related to
finance and strategy,&#8221; according to the memo. The memo&#8217;s
contents were confirmed by Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan
spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Marc will play an instrumental role in leading
initiatives that help drive sustained market leadership and
long-term profitability across the firm, such as our liquidity
project and expense management,&#8221; Braunstein said in the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan last week said fourth-quarter net income slid to
$3.73 billion, or 90 cents a share, from $4.83 billion, or
$1.12, in the same period a year earlier as revenue from
investment banking fell. Full-year profit rose 9 percent from
2010 to a record $19 billion. The shares, which fell 22 percent
last year, rose 43 cents to $37.36 at 3:25 p.m. in New York
trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse said last month that Granetz would leave the
bank &#8220;to pursue an opportunity outside investment banking.&#8221;
Switzerland&#8217;s second-biggest lender by assets named Granetz to
chairman of investment banking at the end of 2009 after he
served five years as co-head of the department, which handles
merger advice and securities underwriting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granetz has overseen global mergers and acquisitions, run
media and telecommunications banking and managed a team that
advised oil and gas companies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Nicholas Dunbar" date="Jan 20, 2012  1:34 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-20/morgan-stanley-diverged-with-goldman-sachs-on-value-at-risk-as-2011-ended.html"><headline>Morgan Stanley Diverged With Goldman Sachs on Value-at-Risk as 2011 Ended</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan
Stanley reported diverging value-at-risk in the fourth quarter
as volatility of some trading positions increased in the wake of
the euro-zone crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley said so-called VaR was reduced to $123
million from $130 million in the previous quarter, the Bloomberg
Risk newsletter reported today. Goldman Sachs said its average
daily VaR increased to $135 million from $102 million amid
heightened volatility. The firms, which released quarterly
earnings this week, define VaR as their biggest anticipated one-
day trading loss 95 percent of the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks came under increasing pressure during last year&#8217;s
second half to manage risk linked to interest rates and Europe
amid the region&#8217;s sovereign debt crisis. In the first days of
this year, New York-based Morgan Stanley (MS) took another step,
completing an amendment to derivative contracts it had with the
Italian government as a counterparty. That reduced credit
exposure by $3.38 billion before hedges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley cut its hedges against Italian default,
reporting $591 million of credit-default-swap protection, down
from $2.78 billion at the end of the third quarter. The bank
doesn&#8217;t recognize hedges on Italy purchased from Italian banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Italian treasury uses derivatives, mostly interest-rate
swaps, to reduce the cost of interest payments on the country&#8217;s
$2 trillion bond liabilities. Morgan Stanley said its net
derivatives counterparty exposure to Italy was $4.2 billion
before the restructuring, which settled on Jan. 3. Morgan
Stanley didn&#8217;t disclose the notional amounts of its derivatives
with Italy. European governments don&#8217;t normally post collateral
on swap contracts with banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French Risk &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley&#8217;s disclosures also show that the bank has a
short position on French sovereign debt, which it uses to offset
a larger long exposure to French non-sovereign institutions. The
short position was $1.7 billion on Dec. 31, down from $2.3
billion at the end of the third quarter, contributing to a net
positive French exposure of $1.7 billion. The bank has a net
$411 million short position on Portuguese sovereign debt, the
filings show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley&#8217;s chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, said
on a conference call with analysts yesterday that the fourth-
quarter decline in VaR was due to reduced activity, especially
in credit products, and the closing out of derivative positions
with MBIA Inc. as part of its settlement with the bond insurer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said its exposure to European sovereigns and
companies before hedges was $3.9 billion, down by $300 million
from the previous quarter, without providing details. The New
York-based firm&#8217;s VaR increase was caused by &#8220;significantly
greater volatility in the interest-rate category,&#8221; Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar said on a Jan. 18 conference call
with analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank includes sovereign and corporate debt within the
interest-rate category for VaR calculation purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A divergence between cash and derivative pricing impacted
hedging and inventory management,&#8221; Viniar said. &#8220;Very unusual
divergence made it very, very hard to manage.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Crayton Harrison" date="Jan 20, 2012 12:33 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-20/televisa-jumped-the-gun-on-seizing-iusacell-control-competitors-claim.html"><headline>Televisa Jumped the Gun on Iusacell Control, Competitors Claim</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVISAA), the broadcaster
buying a 50 percent stake in Mexican mobile-phone carrier Grupo
Iusacell SA, may have effectively seized control of the company
without yet obtaining antitrust approval, competitors claimed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America Movil SAB (AMXL) and NII Holdings Inc. (NIHD) filed complaints to
Mexico&#8217;s Federal Competition Commission in October asking for
sanctions, according to documents obtained by Bloomberg News.
The companies said Televisa gained representation in two of
Iusacell&#8217;s four board seats and chose a new chief financial
officer for the carrier even though the $1.6 billion investment
announced in April has yet to be approved by regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa bought a stake in a holding company in April with
special rights that let it immediately share control of Ricardo
Salinas&#8217;s Iusacell, competitors claimed. The information in the
complaints will probably be used by the commission as it
scrutinizes the deal, said Allen Grunes, an antitrust lawyer at
Brownstein, Hyatt, Farber, Schreck LLP in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be something the competition commission is
going to examine and will take very seriously,&#8221; Grunes said.
&#8220;It&#8217;s very hard to unscramble the egg once you&#8217;ve started
integrating operations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While America Movil&#8217;s complaint was dismissed in December
based on a technicality and NII withdrew the one it had filed,
just days afterwards the commission opened an investigation into
deals between unnamed phone carriers and TV-service providers.
The antitrust agency said such agreements could represent
prohibited concentrations of market power. A lawyer for Salinas
said in January that the probe likely targets the Iusacell deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;$16,000 a Day &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa doesn&#8217;t exercise control of Iusacell and doesn&#8217;t
control management, said a Televisa official who can&#8217;t be named
under company policy. An official at Salinas&#8217;s companies who
can&#8217;t be named under that group&#8217;s policy declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission&#8217;s board plans to discuss the proposed deal
on Jan. 24, agency President Eduardo Perez Motta told Mexico
City&#8217;s Radio Formula in an interview broadcast Jan. 18. The
agency has until Feb. 7 to notify the companies of its decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa, the world&#8217;s largest Spanish-language broadcaster,
is pursuing the investment in Iusacell to add mobile-phone plans
to its packages of pay-TV, home-phone and Internet service. A
finding that the two Mexico City-based companies violated an
order prohibiting them from proceeding with the transaction
while it was under review, may lead to each company being fined
as much as 8 percent of their annual sales in Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complaints by competitors don&#8217;t necessarily prove rules
were broken, Grunes said. In the U.S., &#8220;gun-jumping&#8221; a
transaction before regulators have ruled is punishable by fines
of as much as $16,000 a day, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials for America Movil and NII who can&#8217;t be named
under their companies&#8217; policies declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Potential Monopoly &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa Chief Executive Officer Emilio Azcarraga said last
year the investment in Iusacell would lead to lower prices and
better quality for consumers. That would mean more competition
for Carlos Slim&#8217;s America Movil and NII, the biggest and
smallest of Mexico&#8217;s four wireless carriers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan also would also bring Televisa closer to its major
rival in the broadcast television business. Salinas is also the
majority owner of TV Azteca SAB (AZTECACP), which shares almost all of
Mexico&#8217;s broadcast viewing audience with Televisa. Televisa and
Azteca have both said the Iusacell deal wouldn&#8217;t reduce the
intensity of competition in broadcasting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allowing the two groups to work together would risk
creating a communications monopoly, the Mexican Association for
the Right to Information said in an October statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;GSF Deal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 7, the day the Iusacell agreement was announced,
Televisa bought a 1.09 percent stake in GSF Telecom Holdings
SAPI, which controls Iusacell, according to regulatory filings.
While the stake wouldn&#8217;t normally be enough to constitute
control, America Movil and NII claimed the shares carry special
rights that gave Televisa shared control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa and Iusacell filed their application for antitrust
approval the same day as the GSF transaction, and the agency
issued an order suspending the Televisa-Iusacell deal on April
8, according to the agency&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa agreed to invest $37.5 million for 1.09 percent of
capital and $1.57 billion in convertible debt, said the Televisa
official. The acquisition of capital and convertible debt don&#8217;t
imply a concentration that would legally require requesting
approval from the competition commission, the official said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America Movil and NII argued in their complaints that based
on the bylaws of Iusacell and its holding companies and
subsidiaries, Televisa&#8217;s GSF deal gave Televisa the right to
name one of Iusacell&#8217;s four board members. Televisa was to gain
the right to appoint an additional board member once the debt it
acquired from Iusacell was converted into shares following
regulatory approval, according to the complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Board Members &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Televisa official said the company only has the right
to appoint one board member, and once the transaction is
authorized, Televisa will have the right to name half the board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iusacell&#8217;s four board members are Salinas; Pedro Padilla,
an executive in the Salinas group of companies; Jose Antonio
Lara del Olmo, Televisa&#8217;s vice president of tax; and Jaime Cortes Rocha, a lawyer who has done work for Televisa and served
on the board of airport operator Grupo Aeroportuario del
Pacifico SAB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the airport operator&#8217;s annual report, Cortes
Rocha was a partner in the law firm Mijares, Angoitia, Cortes y
Fuentes SC from 1995 to 2007. Alfonso de Angoitia, Televisa&#8217;s
executive vice president, was a founding partner of the same law
firm from 1994 to 1999 before joining Televisa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cortes Rocha declined to comment in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CFO Appointment &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those relationships show that Televisa already has
representation on half of Iusacell&#8217;s board, America Movil and
NII claimed in their complaints. Iusacell&#8217;s bylaws require a
majority of board members for major decisions such as business
plans and capital increases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bylaws also allowed Televisa to appoint Iusacell&#8217;s CFO,
America Movil and NII claim. Carlos Ferreiro Rivas, the former
finance chief of Televisa&#8217;s Sky business, is now Iusacell&#8217;s CFO,
according to a June 30 U.S. Securities  Exchange Commission
filing by Iusacell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Francisco Borrego, general counsel for Salinas&#8217;s group of
companies, said in an interview last week that it was natural
for Iusacell to hire executives from other companies in the
telecommunications industry, including Televisa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve complied thoroughly with the order not to proceed
with the investment,&#8221; Borrego said in the Jan. 12 telephone
interview. &#8220;In Iusacell there are ex-employees from Nextel,
Telefonica, Telcel, Televisa. We have employees from all of
them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Commission Probe &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NII withdrew its complaint after a December agreement with
Iusacell to drop lawsuits between the two companies, and the
antitrust agency rejected America Movil&#8217;s filing because the
transaction was still under review, according to a document
dated Dec. 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three days later, the agency began investigating agreements
between phone carriers and TV-programming providers, without
naming the companies targeted. While the agency hasn&#8217;t contacted
Salinas&#8217;s ventures or Televisa about that probe, the companies
believe the investigation is directed at them, Borrego said in
the interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An antitrust official who can&#8217;t be named under the agency&#8217;s
policy declined to comment about the review of the Televisa-Iusacell deal and about the probe that began in December. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, was sued over mortgage-backed securities
sold to Dexia SA (DEXB) because the loans underlying the securities
were allegedly riskier than promised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dexia accused JPMorgan and companies it acquired -- Bear
Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual -- of &#8220;egregious fraud,&#8221;
saying they created and sold mortgage bonds backed by loans that
they knew to be &#8220;exceptionally bad.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dexia, the Brussels-based French-Belgian lender, said the
complaint, filed yesterday in New York State Supreme Court,
involves about $1.7 billion of mortgage securities. Dexia
suffered &#8220;substantial losses&#8221; because mortgages were of poorer
quality and the risks of default and losses were much higher
than represented, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Dexia SA v. Bear Stearns  Co. Inc., 650180-
2012, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were searching for Apple
Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s European patent lawyers on a Friday, you would have
better luck looking in the German city of Mannheim than on the
golf course or in a pub. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judges in the southwest German city hold most patent
hearings on the last day of the week and will issue rulings in
smartphone disputes involving Apple, Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) and
Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. over four of the next five
Fridays starting today. The city, along with Dusseldorf and
Munich, has become the center of European patent litigation as
companies seek quick rulings from German judges that influence
courts throughout the continent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you have a big multinational corporation setting up a
patent litigation strategy for Europe, they will almost always
sue in Germany,&#8221; said Rowan Freeland, a litigator at Simmons 
Simmons LLP in London. &#8220;Maybe you add other countries as well,
but if you have to choose, it&#8217;s almost certainly Germany.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile device makers filed dozens of cases in the three
cities last year. Samsung today lost a patent-infringement suit
filed against Apple in the Mannheim court. The judges also heard
another suit between the two rivals. A hearing in two disputes
between Motorola Mobility and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) originally
scheduled for this afternoon were postponed until next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung said it was disappointed by today&#8217;s ruling and
added that the decision isn&#8217;t indicative for other pending
cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Throw in the Towel&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany&#8217;s role in the European economy is just as important
as the speed of the rulings, issued by specialist judges, said
Peter-Michael Weisse, an attorney at intellectual-property
litigation firm Wildanger in Dusseldorf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you want to conquer the European market and you&#8217;re
being stopped in Germany, most of the time that&#8217;s enough to
throw in the towel,&#8221; Weisse said. &#8220;Many companies say if they
cannot sell in Germany, it&#8217;s no use to go ahead with a product
somewhere else.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London and The Hague, Netherlands, compete with Germany as
venues for European patent litigation. The Netherlands&#8217;
disadvantage is a smaller economy, while the U.K. is hindered by
high legal costs, Freeland said. While there is no pan-European
patent, courts often look for similar rulings in other
countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Litigants want judges who know about patents, they want a
procedure which is inexpensive, one which is fast, allowing for
a ruling within a year, and one where the result will secure a
commercial advantage,&#8221; Freeland said. &#8220;Holland and the U.K.
each provide three of those. Germany provides all four.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three-Hour Hearings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany has no U.S.-style pretrial evidence exchange and
the facts are submitted in writing. In the U.K., lawyers must
present their cases at oral hearings, and a trial can take as
many as 14 days, said Thomas Bopp, a patent litigator at Gleiss
Lutz in Dusseldorf. By contrast, an average German hearing takes
three hours and the court may hear more than one suit in a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;German lawyers&#8217; rates aren&#8217;t necessarily less expensive
than those of British attorneys, but it consumes more hours if
you have to dig through floods of documents and appear for weeks
in court,&#8221; Bopp said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany has become a key venue for the lawsuits between
Apple and Samsung over mobile technologies and designs since the
iPhone maker last year accused its South Korean rival of copying
products. Samsung, also a chip supplier for Apple, edged out the
U.S. company as the top smartphone seller in the third quarter,
helped by its Galaxy products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MPEG 2-Standard &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another factor speeding German rulings is the separation of
infringement suits and actions seeking to nullify patents. While
in most jurisdictions a defendant can ask the court to rule that
the patent is invalid, a tactic that potentially can delay
proceedings, in Germany he has to go to a separate specialized
court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German judges have had an important role in intellectual
property litigation for years, said Thomas Kuehnen, presiding
judge at the Dusseldorf Higher Regional Court. He pointed to a
Dusseldorf ruling in the 2000s that led to the resolution of
hundreds of lawsuits over the MPEG 2-Standard, a technology to
store video and audio data on DVDs. The court ruling formed the
basis of a global settlement involving more than 700 patents in
54 countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuehnen says German judges develop expertise because of the
number of cases they review. While about 50 patent suits a year
are filed in the U.K. and the Netherlands, as many as 1,300
reach German courts, about half of them in Dusseldorf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expert Opinions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While patent suits can be filed in any German city, lawyers
prefer Dusseldorf and Mannheim, because the courts have
specialized patent-infringement chambers. Judges in others
cities, who rarely get these types of cases, need more time and
seek expert opinions on the technology more often than their
Dusseldorf and Mannheim colleagues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last three or four years, about 60 percent of cases
filed in Dusseldorf involve parties from outside of Germany,
Judge Kuehnen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Multinationals from Asia, the U.K. or the U.S. are
changing the litigation landscape here. It has become much more
complex,&#8221; Kuehnen said. &#8220;We see the globalization in our
courtroom.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
said it did nothing wrong when it fired a former Singapore
trader because he sought to manipulate London interbank offered
rates to boost his own profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tan Chi Min, the former trader, sued the bank over his
dismissal and is seeking to recoup $1.5 million in bonuses and
3.3 million RBS shares that he claims he&#8217;s owed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tan deserved to be fired because he was guilty of &#8220;gross
misconduct,&#8221; RBS, Britain&#8217;s biggest government-owned lender,
said in court papers filed in Singapore High Court on Jan. 18.
He tried to improperly influence RBS&#8217;s (RBS) rate setters from 2007 to
2011 and persuade them to submit Libor rates at particular
levels to his benefit, RBS said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBS is cooperating with investigations by the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, U.S. Justice Department
and European Commission into whether Libor had been manipulated.
Since as early as 2007, investors have accused several banks on
the Libor panel of distorting market prices by hiding true
borrowing costs, leading to a series of lawsuits filed in 2011
that are making their way through courts in Europe and the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tan said in his complaint dated Dec. 27 that he was in no
position to influence the rate on his own. The former head of
delta trading for RBS&#8217;s global banking and markets division in
Singapore said the bank failed to detail the allegations against
him and didn&#8217;t specify how he had improperly influenced the
setting of Libor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suresh Nair, Tan&#8217;s lawyer, declined to comment on RBS&#8217;s
filing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Megaupload Shut Down in U.S. Criminal Conspiracy Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Megaupload.com, a file-sharing website, was shut down while
companies and individuals associated with it were charged with
running a criminal enterprise that cost copyright owners more
than $500 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charges against seven individuals, Megaupload Ltd. and
Vestor Ltd. were unsealed yesterday in federal court in
Alexandria, Virginia, after four of the defendants were arrested
in Auckland, New Zealand. Three of the suspects remain at large,
according to a Justice Department statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This action is among the largest criminal copyright cases
ever brought by the United States and directly targets the
misuse of a public content storage and distribution site to
commit and facilitate intellectual property crime,&#8221; according
to the e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Megaupload indictment was filed as the U.S. Congress
considers anti-piracy legislation supported by the movie and
music industries that has prompted a backlash from companies
including Google Inc. and the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation
Inc. as well as Web consumers. The opponents say the Stop Online
Piracy Act in the House and the Protect IP Act in the Senate
would promote online censorship, disrupt the Web&#8217;s architecture
and harm their ability to innovate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About an hour after the indictments were unsealed, the
public websites of the Justice Department, the Motion Picture
Association of America, and the Recording Industry Association
of America wouldn&#8217;t load. The so-called hacker-activist group
Anonymous took credit for the disruptions, citing protest
against the Megaupload prosecutions, according to Twitter
accounts used to publicize the group&#8217;s activities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Kim Dotcom, 12-00003, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of Virginia (Alexandria). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP, Anadarko Should Be Held Liable Before Trial, U.S. Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc (BP\), Transocean Ltd. and Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC) should
be found liable before trial for violations of federal pollution
laws stemming from the April 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill,
lawyers for the U.S. argued yesterday at a hearing in federal
court in New Orleans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department is asking U.S. District Judge Carl
Barbier to find the companies violated the Clean Water Act on
the basis of so-called strict liability because they were
operators of the doomed project. Barbier, who&#8217;s overseeing much
of the spill litigation, has scheduled a nonjury trial for Feb.
27 to determine liability and apportion fault for the disaster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ruling by Barbier against the companies would mean they
couldn&#8217;t fight allegations of Clean Water Act violations at the
trial and would allow the U.S. to seek fines of as much as
$1,100 from each company per barrel of oil spilled. The
government has also asked Barbier to find Anadarko and
Transocean (RIG) liable under the Oil Pollution Act, a separate
environmental law, for cleanup costs and damages. BP already
accepted responsibility for those costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge said he wouldn&#8217;t rule yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if Barbier does rule for the U.S. on its bid for a
pretrial decision, the question of gross negligence, which will
determine whether the companies are subject to enhanced fines
under the Clean Water Act, will be considered at trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Barbier denies the U.S. motion, he&#8217;ll determine at trial
which companies can be held liable and thus subject to fines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The April 2010 Macondo well blowout and explosion killed 11
workers and caused the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history.
The accident spurred hundreds of lawsuits against BP (BP/) and its
partners, including Transocean, the Switzerland-based owner and
operator of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig that exploded,
and Anadarko, which owned 25 percent of the well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP, Anadarko and Transocean argued that they should be able
to defend themselves at trial against the federal claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Oil Spill by the Oil Rig Deepwater
Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010, MDL-2179, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News Corp. &#8216;Startling&#8217; E-Mails Trigger New U.K. Computer Search &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News Corp.&#8217;s U.K. newspaper unit must search nine more
computers for evidence ex-employees sought to cover up a scheme
to hack into celebrities&#8217; phones, a U.K. judge ruled after
seeing secret e-mails he called &#8220;startling.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The publisher&#8217;s recent &#8220;limited admission&#8221; that senior
managers knew of the voice-mail interceptions and tried to
conceal them from police by destroying e-mail archives isn&#8217;t
sufficient reason to avoid new searches that could reveal more
damaging evidence before a trial, Judge Geoffrey Vos said
yesterday in London. The order applies to three laptops used by
an unidentified former senior employee and six other computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They are to be treated as deliberate destroyers of
evidence,&#8221; Vos said of London-based News International at the
hearing. &#8220;I have been shown a number of e-mails which are
confidential. Suffice it to say they show a rather startling
approach to the e-mail&#8221; practices at the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News International&#8217;s lawyer, Dinah Rose, argued the
searches were a waste of time because there was little chance
they contained anything relevant to the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We accept we are the villains,&#8221; Rose told Vos. &#8220;We have
the horns and the tails.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

immediately returned. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese Issuer, MA Claims Boost Securities Lawsuits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Securities class-action lawsuits in the U.S. increased 6.8
percent last year, led by claims against companies involved in
mergers and acquisitions and Chinese companies listed on U.S.
exchanges through reverse mergers, a study found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuits include MA claims involving Verizon
Communications Inc. (VZ) and Terremark Worldwide Inc. (TMRK), Smurfit-Stone
Container Corp. (SSCC) and Rock-Tenn Co. (RKT), and Exelon Corp. (EXC) and
Constellation Energy Group Inc. (CEG), according to Stanford Law
School&#8217;s Securities Class Action Clearinghouse, which conducted
the study with Cornerstone Research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MA-related cases constituted almost 23 percent of the 188
total federal securities class actions filed in 2011,
Cornerstone Research said. That&#8217;s unchanged from 2010, when 176
total class actions were filed, according to the study. Overall,
the number of class actions filed last year was 3 percent below
the annual average of 194 filings from 1997 to 2010, the
report&#8217;s authors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s only the growth of merger-related litigation, which
has historically been brought in state courts, that inflates the
aggregate statistics so that they even approach historic
norms,&#8221; Joseph Grundfest, director of the Stanford
clearinghouse, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits alleging violations of accounting rules and
financial restatements by Chinese issuers comprised more than 17
percent of all federal securities class actions, according to
the report. Twenty-four of the 33 lawsuits against Chinese firms
were filed in the first half of 2011, which Grundfest said may
mean that this type of litigation is subsiding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The rapid run-up and subsequent decline of litigation
against Chinese issuers that entered the U.S. market through
reverse mergers suggest that this form of litigation may be
close to having run its course,&#8221; Grundfest said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits against Chinese issuers involved China
MediaExpress Holdings Inc. (CCME), Sino Clean Energy Inc. (SCEI) and Deer
Consumer Products Inc. (DEER), according to Stanford&#8217;s clearinghouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Judge Denies &#8216;Occupy&#8217; Request to Allow Courthouse Rally &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group calling itself &#8220;Occupy the Courts&#8221; lost a bid to
force the U.S. to issue a permit for a rally outside a New York
federal courthouse today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan yesterday denied a last-
minute request by the group and by Jarret Wolfman, an organizer
of the rally, for a court order compelling the U.S. General
Services Administration to allow it to take place today outside
the courthouse, on Pearl Street in lower Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Wolfman, go and demonstrate to your heart&#8217;s content,
but not outside the Pearl Street entrance on the federal side,&#8221;
Kaplan told Wolfman at the end of a hearing in the same
courthouse yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event, intended to coincide with similar protests
outside 120 U.S. courthouses in 46 states, was planned to begin
in the plaza outside the Daniel Patrick Moynihan U.S. Courthouse
between 4 and 6 p.m. today, then move to a march and rally at
nearby Foley Square. Organizers said they want to call attention
to a 2010 Supreme Court decision that made it easier for
corporations to spend money in election campaigns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The purpose of the day of action is to mark the second
anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court (1000L)&#8217;s infamous Citizens United
v. Federal Election Commission decision that opened the
floodgates to unlimited corporate money in elections,&#8221; Occupy
the Courts said in a complaint filed with the court last night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit was filed against two U.S. General Services
Administration officials, Wesley French and Joanna Rosato. The
GSA denied the rally permit on Jan. 13, citing a conflict with
the swearing in of new citizens and a ceremony to seat a new
judge, Occupy the Courts said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaplan ruled that the area outside the courthouse, which he
said is a potential terrorist target, isn&#8217;t a public forum. As a
result, the government may impose restrictions on free speech if
they are reasonable and content-neutral, he said. Kaplan said
that no permit has ever been issued for a demonstration outside
the courthouse. He cited the government&#8217;s security concerns in
refusing to order a permit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re considering our options,&#8221; Gideon Oliver, a lawyer
representing Occupy the Courts, said after the hearing. &#8220;The
organizers of tomorrow&#8217;s protest will have to take the court&#8217;s
decision into account and determine where and how they&#8217;ll end up
protesting.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wolfman, asked after the hearing what he planned to do in
response to Kaplan&#8217;s ruling, said &#8220;I don&#8217;t know yet.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for the Manhattan U.S.
Attorney&#8217;s office, which represented the government in the case,
declined to comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Wolfman v. French, No. 12-CV-443, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Loses Another Bid to Block $18 Billion Ecuador Award &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) lost another bid before a U.S appeals court
for an order blocking enforcement of an Ecuadorean court&#8217;s $18
billion environmental damages verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, had asked a
panel of judges at the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York to set
aside its Sept. 19 ruling rejecting a trial judge&#8217;s decision in
March that blocked collection of the Ecuadorean judgment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a related decision, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan
this month refused Chevron&#8217;s request to restrain Ecuadorean
assets that could be seized as part of the Ecuadorean judgment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron was ordered on Feb. 14 to pay as much as $18
billion in compensatory and punitive damages for Texaco Inc.&#8217;s
alleged dumping of toxic drilling wastes in the Ecuadorean
jungle from 1964 to about 1992. The ruling came in an 18-year-
old lawsuit decided by a judge in Lago Agrio, a provincial
capital near the Colombian border. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Jan. 3, an Ecuadorean appeals court upheld the February
ruling &#8220;in all of its parts, including the conviction for moral
reparation or its alternative and costs,&#8221; according to the
decision. Chevron can appeal the decision to the next level of
Ecuador&#8217;s judiciary, a company spokesman said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The racketeering case is Chevron v. Donziger, 11-00691,
U.S. District Court, District of New York (Manhattan). The case
in Ecuador is Maria Aquinda v. Chevron, 002-2003, Superior Court
of Nueva Loja, Lago Agrio, Ecuador. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jefferson County Wins Access to JPMorgan Settlement Documents &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferson County (3681MF), Alabama, won permission to review a
settlement between JPMorgan Chase  Co. and an investor who sued
the bank for fraud related to the county&#8217;s defaulted sewer
bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Thomas B. Bennett in Birmingham
approved a request by the county to question the investor, James
R. Crane, and to review the settlement that ended his lawsuit
against JPMorgan, which underwrote the bonds. Bennett ordered
Crane to appear at the Houston offices of his law firm to answer
questions about the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The county is seeking information to use in its own lawsuit
against New York-based JPMorgan. Now that Crane has settled, the
county said it is concerned information he collected as part of
his case may be thrown away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If such information is discarded, destroyed or otherwise
lost, the county may be unable to obtain the documents,&#8221; the
county said in its request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferson County filed for bankruptcy in November after the
county, state officials and bondholders failed to implement a
tentative agreement to reduce its $3 billion in sewer debt by
about $1 billion, raise rates and win financial support from the
Alabama state legislature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Jefferson County, 11-05736-9, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Alabama (Birmingham). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Cantor Hong Kong Managers Say Resignations Were Independent &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason Boyer, the former head of Cantor Fitzgerald LP&#8217;s Hong
Kong business, denied coordinating his resignation last year
with other employees of the New York brokerage or helping to
poach them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t 100 percent sure they were leaving until after I
left,&#8221; he told Hong Kong&#8217;s Court of First Instance yesterday.
Boyer and three other former managing directors are defending a
lawsuit from Cantor&#8217;s Europe and Hong Kong units accusing them
of breaching their employment contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boyer, Brett McGonegal and Bradford Ainslie -- formerly of
Cantor&#8217;s Asian cash equities desk -- and Uwe Parpart, Cantor&#8217;s
former Asia chief economist and strategist, resigned last May to
join Reorient Financial Markets Ltd., a boutique investment bank
backed by an asset manager under China&#8217;s State-owned Assets
Supervision and Administration Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ainslie, who also testified yesterday, said that his
decision to leave was &#8220;at all times&#8221; his own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicholas Cooney, Cantor&#8217;s lawyer, said the defendants&#8217;
resignation on the same day and their joint meeting with Johnson
Ko, an executive director of the Hong Kong-listed company that
owns Reorient Financial, show they were working in concert. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least three of them used the same lawyer to review their
employment contracts and Boyer&#8217;s draft contract showed edits
that were incorporated into those of his co-defendants, Cooney
said while questioning Boyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Chan, Cantor&#8217;s chief financial officer in Hong Kong,
testified Jan. 18 that the departures resulted in a 29 percent
decline in average monthly revenue for the Hong Kong cash
equities business. At least three other staff left Cantor on the
same day in July to join Reorient, Cooney said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Cantor Fitzgerald Europe, Cantor Fitzgerald
(Hong Kong) Capital Markets Ltd. and Jason Boyer, Bradford
Ainslie, Brett McGonegal, Uwe Henke von Parpart, HCA1160/2011 in
Hong Kong&#8217;s Court of First Instance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News Corp. (NWSA) Settles With Jude Law, Other Phone-Hack Victims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News Corp.&#8217;s British newspaper unit settled 36 lawsuits by
phone-hacking victims including actor Jude Law and soccer player
Ashley Cole, with compensation set on the basis that senior
managers at the company knew of the practice and tried to
conceal it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlements by London-based News International resolve
more than half of the 60 lawsuits filed by victims of voice-mail
interceptions at its now-defunct News of the World tabloid. News
International agreed to a range of cash payments to victims and
provided details about hacking, including the number of
journalists involved, three lawyers representing victims said in
a statement ahead of a hearing yesterday before Judge Geoffrey
Vos in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News International &#8220;is ready, willing and able to settle&#8221;
all the claims and a trial shouldn&#8217;t be necessary, company
lawyer Michael Silverleaf said at the hearing. The compensation
is &#8220;generous.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement amounts are larger than those normally paid
in privacy-violation cases, according to yesterday&#8217;s statement.
They range from 5,000 pounds ($7,700) for less-serious phone-
hacking instances to about 100,000 pounds for the most-offensive
cases, a person familiar with the matter said. Of the 18
settlements outlined in court yesterday, total payouts will be
at least 642,000 pounds plus legal fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreements come about a month before the first civil
trial in the matter is scheduled to begin. Vos said a trial is
still important for resolving various issues stemming from phone
hacking to help settle future cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 10 cases prepared to go to trial, including those
by sports agent Sky Andrew, comedian Steve Coogan and pop star

&lt;p&gt;JJ to Pay $158 Million to Settle Texas Risperdal Drug Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) agreed to pay $158 million to settle
Texas officials&#8217; claims that the drugmaker fraudulently marketed
its Risperdal anti-psychotic drug, ending a trial over the
allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JJ&#8217;s settlement will resolve claims it defrauded the
state&#8217;s Medicaid program by promoting Risperdal for uses not
approved by U.S. regulators, including for children with
psychiatric disorders, the company said yesterday. The state
also claimed the New Brunswick, New Jersey-based drugmaker
downplayed the health risk of Risperdal. The settlement was
about one-quarter of the $579 million the state was seeking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Under the terms of the settlement, Janssen will pay $158
million in full resolution of all claims in Texas,&#8221; Teresa
Mueller, a company spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. &#8220;This
settlement represents a resolution to claims brought by the
state in 2004 for alleged Medicaid overpayment during the years
1994-2008, and will circumvent potentially lengthy and costly
appellate activities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas settlement is the first time JJ and Janssen have
agreed to resolve a state&#8217;s claims over Risperdal, Mueller said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JJ, the world&#8217;s largest health-care products company, and
its Janssen unit agreed to the accord in the middle of a four-
week trial of the state&#8217;s lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Today&#8217;s agreement sends a strong message that the state
will pursue those who defraud Texas taxpayers,&#8221; Greg Abbott,
Texas attorney general, said in a statement. &#8220;Johnson 
Johnson&#8217;s scheme to profit from the Medicaid program by
overstating the safety and effectiveness of an expensive drug
and improperly influencing officials ended up costing taxpayers
millions of dollars.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas joined a lawsuit filed in 2004 by a whistle-blower,
Allen Jones, an ex-investigator for the Pennsylvania Office of
Inspector General. Jones said he was fired after probing company
payments to a top pharmacist in Pennsylvania&#8217;s government who
hid the money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re not disappointed at all&#8221; by the size of the
settlement, Tom Melsheimer, Jones&#8217;s lawyer, said in an interview
yesterday. The settlement is &#8220;the largest in a Texas Medicaid
fraud case brought by the state,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement will be split between the state, the federal
government, Jones and his attorneys, Mueller said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;ve no idea what the distribution of the settlement will
be,&#8221; Jones said in an interview yesterday. He said his first
reaction to the settlement was, &#8220;Damn, I wanted another two
days of testimony.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial showed that Janssen &#8220;subverted science and
induced others to betray the people they were supposed to take
care of,&#8221; Jones said. &#8220;To me, that&#8217;s reprehensible.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas case is Texas v. Janssen LP, D-1GV-04-001288,
District Court, Travis County, Texas (Austin). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;London Lawyer Pay Increases 10% as Firms Compete for Talent &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay for London lawyers rose 10 percent last year to 146,500
pounds ($225,800) as firms competed for a limited supply of
attorneys, a legal recruiter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average base pay for salaried lawyers in the British
capital rose 4 percent to 111,000 pounds and bonuses increased
to 35,500 pounds, recruiter Laurence Simons said in a statement.
In comparison, base pay rose 2.1 percent in 2011 for
accountants, and 1.2 percent for all U.K. professionals, the
recruiter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay and bonuses for lawyers have &#8220;been pushed up by the
limited supply of talent in their market, making retention the
name of the game,&#8221; said Lucinda Moule, managing director at
Laurence Simons. &#8220;A tough 2010 means employers have focused
primarily on boosting salaries rather than increasing
headcount.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least three top London-based law firms raised salaries
for lawyers last year after freezing or cutting pay by as much
as 11 percent. Clifford Chance LLP (1000L), Freshfields Bruckhaus
Deringer LLP (1002L) and Slaughter and May raised salaries and said they
would pay bonuses last June. More experienced lawyers that have
partnership interests in a firm are paid based on the firm&#8217;s
financial performance rather than receiving a set salary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top U.S. firms still offer higher salaries in London, with
Bingham McCutchen LLP and others paying 100,000 pounds to start,
to match New York levels. London legal salaries are comparable
to entry-level pay at a financial company, without the promise
of a large bonus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decline in unemployment and pickup
in manufacturing point to accelerating U.S. growth. Some
economists say the numbers may not be as good as they look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason: the severity of the economy&#8217;s plunge in late
2008 and early 2009 after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
collapsed threw a wrench into models used to smooth the data for
seasonal changes, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and Nomura Securities International Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jobless rate has dropped 0.4 percentage point over the
past two months, according to the Labor Department, and the
Institute for Supply Management&#8217;s factory index has climbed more
than three points since the end of August. Signs the world&#8217;s
largest economy was strengthening helped propel a 14 percent
gain in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index in the past eight weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The impact of the financial crisis does seem to have
affected seasonal factors for several indicators,&#8221; Andrew Tilton, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs, said in a telephone
interview from New York. It &#8220;might tend to make things look a
little better in the early winter and look a little worse in the
spring time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most economic data are adjusted for seasonal changes to
facilitate month-to-month comparisons. Without those changes,
for example, construction would always pick up in the summer,
when the weather is milder, and decline in the winter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adjustment process is unable to distinguish between a
one-time shock, like Lehman&#8217;s demise, and a recurring issue that
would need to be smoothed away. For that reason, the mechanism
gives some data a leg up from about September through about
March before turning negative the rest of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Recession &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economy contracted at an average 7.8 percent annual
pace from October 2008 through March 2009, the worst back-to-
back quarters in the post World War II era. The 18-month
recession ended in June 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adjustment process &#8220;has been knocked out of whack by
the financial crisis,&#8221; Ellen Zentner, a senior U.S. economist
at Nomura in New York, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;The
model ends up adjusting for a growth pattern that isn&#8217;t there.
The sudden drop-off in economic activity in late 2008 is not a
pattern, it doesn&#8217;t happen late every year. It was a one-off
event.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Around April the seasonal bias turns and starts working
against the data,&#8221; said Zentner, who shared her findings in
research notes issued in December and last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beating Peers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nomura was the fourth-best employment forecaster for the
two years through December, according to Bloomberg calculations.
Goldman Sachs was No. 1 among forecasters of gross domestic
product during the 12 months through June 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks were little changed today as investors weighed
developments in Europe&#8217;s efforts to take its debt crisis. The
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index closed at 1,316 in New York, up less
than 0.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French business confidence unexpectedly fell in January to
the lowest in almost two years, providing the latest sign that
Europe&#8217;s second-largest economy is mired in a recession, figures
from the statistics office Insee showed today in Paris. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, prices paid by Australian producers decelerated
in the October through December period for a third straight
quarter, boosting scope for the central bank to lower borrowing
costs next month, data from the Bureau of Statistics showed in
Sydney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jobless Rate &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. seasonal distortions are most acute for the
jobless rate, according to a report by Tilton issued Jan. 13.
The shift moves the rate by about a tenth of a point per month
on average relative to the adjustment before the crisis, he
said. The influence is most positive from November through
January, Tilton&#8217;s research showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overcompensation probably accounts for about 0.2
percentage point of the 0.4-point drop in the jobless rate over
the past two months, according to Zentner&#8217;s calculations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economists at Goldman Sachs forecast unemployment will
average 8.5 percent this year, unchanged from December&#8217;s
reading. Nomura&#8217;s estimate is 8.4 percent. Zentner and Tilton
agree that data on GDP aren&#8217;t affected by the seasonal issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the unemployment rate, the other indicators
that show a marked influence include retail sales, consumer
prices excluding food and fuel costs and the total number of
people on jobless benefit rolls, Tilton said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Rupkey is among those who are more optimistic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Optimistic &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Forecasters have moved too far to the other side of the
boat, they&#8217;ve gone too pessimistic,&#8221; said Rupkey, chief
financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in New
York, who forecasts unemployment will average 8 percent this
year. &#8220;The data is surprising to the upside and that leads us
to believe the entire year will surprise the market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ISM&#8217;s factory gauge has also been skewed by the
seasonal adjustment issues, according to Tilton&#8217;s and Zentner&#8217;s
research. Tilton estimates the deviation from the pre-crisis
adjustment averages about 0.35 point a month, and the most
positive influence occurs from September through December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manufacturing index was at 53.9 last month compared
with 50.6 in August, last year&#8217;s low point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bias stemming from the financial crisis has been
accompanied this year by warmer and drier weather than usual,
which has also boosted some data, said Tilton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The housing-related data probably benefited from the fact
that the weather was relatively nice in December,&#8221; said Tilton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Construction Gain &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-family housing starts rose in December to a 470,000
annual pace from 450,000 the prior month and the highest since
April 2010, the Commerce Department reported last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homebuilders may not be the only industry benefitting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profits at Union Pacific Corp. (UNP), the biggest U.S. railroad,
topped estimates in the fourth quarter as carloads advanced 3
percent, led by gains in autos and chemicals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shipments of chemicals improved as &#8220;favorable weather and
strong demand extended the shipping seasons,&#8221; John Koraleski,
executive vice president of marketing and sales at Union
Pacific, said on a Jan. 19 conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the seasonal adjustment may have augmented the
improvement in growth, it does not cast doubt that growth has
strengthened, said Tilton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The main driver is the fundamental state of the
economy,&#8221; said Tilton. The drop in fuel prices in the second
half of the year and the rebound in confidence from the
&#8220;uncertainty shock&#8221; caused by the debt-ceiling debate have
played a bigger role in the improvement, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. was sued by
Manulife Financial Corp.&#8217;s John Hancock Life Insurance unit,
which accused the bank of fraud in connection with the sale of
residential mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed today in New York state Supreme Court in
Manhattan, seeks unspecified damages for losses of market value
and principal and interest payments, as well as rescission and
recovery of payment for the investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Hancock bought the securities &#8220;in reliance on the
false and misleading&#8221; statements made by the defendants, which
include Bear Stearns  Co. and Washington Mutual Inc. (WAMUQ), both of
which were acquired by JPMorgan, lawyers for the Boston-based
insurer said in the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Based on these material misrepresentations and omissions,
plaintiffs purchased securities that were far riskier than had
been represented, backed by mortgage loans worth significantly
less than had been represented, and that had been made to
borrowers who were much less creditworthy than had been
represented,&#8221; attorneys for John Hancock said in the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
biggest recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
and the crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the
market for the securities evaporated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a telephone message left at her office
seeking comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) jumped the most
since May 2010 in Czech trading after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
said the valuation of the Austrian lender&#8217;s shares relative to
its peers represents a buying opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock surged for an eighth day, the longest rally since
March 2009, rising 12 percent to 425 koruna at the 4:24 p.m.
close in Prague. Almost 1.4 million shares changed hands today,
or 269 percent of the three-month daily average. The PX (PX) index,
where the bank has a 21 percent weighting, rose 2.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erste&#8217;s eight-day, 34 percent rally still leaves the stock
down by more than half compared with a year ago. That&#8217;s cut the
price to 7.8 times expected earnings from 11 and lowered the
market value to 6.5 billion euros ($8.4 billion). The market
value of the Czech Republic&#8217;s Komercni Banka AS (KOMB), which last
traded at 10.2 times expected earnings, has declined 18 percent
in the past 12 months to 134.5 billion koruna ($6.9 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A valuation opportunity has arisen in our view, with
Erste&#8217;s total market cap now broadly similar to that of
Komercni,&#8221; Goldman analysts led by Heiner Luz in New York said
in a report to clients today. The U.S. bank kept its &#8220;buy&#8221;
rating on Erste shares, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Vienna, its home market, Erste shares last traded up 11
percent to 16.875 euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European stocks and the euro rallied as finance ministers
gathered in Brussels to discuss new budget rules and a Greek
debt swap. Bondholders negotiating the swap with Greece have
made their &#8220;maximum&#8221; offer, leaving it to the European Union
and International Monetary Fund to decide whether to accept the
deal, said Charles Dallara, managing director of the Institute
of International Finance, who represents the private creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The financial sector has benefited from reports that
talks between the Greek government and its creditors on debt-
restructuring terms are successfully progressing,&#8221; Miroslav Adamkovic, an analyst at Prague-based Komercni Banka, wrote in a
report to clients today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Galleon Group LLC trader David
Slaine, who helped lead U.S. authorities to investigate the
hedge fund firm&#8217;s co-founder, Raj Rajaratnam, was sentenced to
three years of probation for securities fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slaine wore a wire to record dozens of conversations with
suspects including ex-Galleon trader Zvi Goffer who were later
charged with insider trading. He provided help that prosecutors
from the office of Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara called
&#8220;nothing short of extraordinary.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan, who sentenced Slaine
Jan. 20 in Manhattan federal court, also ordered him to perform
300 hours of community service and pay a $500,000 fine. Sullivan
praised Slaine&#8217;s cooperation, which began in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Slaine, you have your life back,&#8221; Sullivan said at
the end of the sentencing hearing. &#8220;I think you&#8217;ve earned it,
by virtue of the work you&#8217;ve done over the last five years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slaine&#8217;s evidence helped spur what became the biggest probe
of insider trading at hedge funds, prosecutors said in a letter
to Sullivan this month. His lawyer, Stephen Kaufman, said Slaine
already has paid $836,000 in criminal forfeitures and to the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slaine is now an investor at Spot, a Manhattan-based chain
that provides training, grooming and daycare for dogs, according
to Kaufman. Slaine also works there, Kaufman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These last four years have been humbling and
humiliating,&#8221; Slaine told Sullivan at his sentencing hearing.
&#8220;I am ashamed of the bad decisions that I made back in 2002,
which haunt me to this day.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slaine, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy and securities
fraud in December 2009, testified at the trial of Goffer, his
brother Emanuel Goffer and Michael Kimelman, that he cooperated
with federal agents for about 2 1/2 years to try to avoid
prison. He faced a sentence of as long as 25 years in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slaine testified that he became friends in the late 1980s
or early 1990s with Craig Drimal, another former trader who
pleaded guilty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Goffer, 10-cr-00056, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dexia Sues JPMorgan Over $1.7 Billion in Mortgage Securities &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest U.S. bank by assets, was
sued over mortgage-backed securities sold to Dexia SA (DEXB) because
the loans underlying the securities were allegedly riskier than
promised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dexia accused JPMorgan and companies it acquired -- Bear
Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual -- of &#8220;egregious fraud,&#8221;
saying they created and sold mortgage bonds backed by loans that
they knew to be &#8220;exceptionally bad.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dexia, the Brussels-based French-Belgian lender, said the
complaint, filed Jan. 19 in New York State Supreme Court,
involves about $1.7 billion of mortgage securities. Dexia
suffered &#8220;substantial losses&#8221; because mortgages were of poorer
quality and the risks of default and losses were much higher
than represented, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan, didn&#8217;t respond to an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Dexia SA v. Bear Stearns  Co. Inc.,
650180-2012, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corzine Sued for RICO Violation by MF Global Customers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Corzine, MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ)&#8217;s former chief
executive officer, was sued under U.S. racketeering law by
commodity customers alleging he and other executives
&#8220;unlawfully&#8221; took money from their accounts and failed to
segregate their money as the law requires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit alleges that hundreds of millions of dollars were
transferred from customers&#8217; accounts to other MF Global units,
at a time when the company was short of cash and faced calls for
collateral as its risky Eurobond and other investments fell in
value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Named in the suit, JPMorgan Chase  Co., the company&#8217;s
banker, should have noticed the &#8220;depletion&#8221; of customer money,
and should have investigated, according to the complaint. The
customers are seeking unspecified restitution and damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan on Jan. 20 on
behalf of Robert Marcin and other MF Global segregated account
holders by Grant  Eisenhofer PA, is one of at least 10 against
Corzine and other MF Global executives. Plaintiffs including the
Virginia Retirement System have been competing to lead a
consolidated lawsuit seeking so-called class-action status. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary Sedarat, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to comment
on the suit. Andrew Levander, a lawyer for Corzine, didn&#8217;t
respond to an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Marcin v. Corzine, 12-cv-0499, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CFTC Position Limits Rule Lawsuit Dismissed by Appeals Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Wall Street groups&#8217; challenge to a U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission rule on position limits must first be
considered in a trial court, a federal appeals court ruled,
dismissing the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals in
Washington said Jan. 20 that it doesn&#8217;t have jurisdiction to
consider the case because the Commodity Exchange Act and last
year&#8217;s Dodd-Frank law &#8220;are silent&#8221; on whether the rule can be
directly challenged to the appeals court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Initial review occurs at the appellate level only when a
direct-review statute specifically gives the court of appeals
subject-matter jurisdiction to directly review agency action,&#8221;
Judges Judith Rogers, Merrick Garland and Janice Rogers Brown
said, citing circuit precedent. &#8220;There is no express
congressional authorization of direct appellate review
applicable to the petition for review in this case.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc.
and Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association filed
an emergency request Jan. 9 urging the appeals court to put the
rule on hold while the court considers their legal challenge.
The groups asked the court to issue a ruling by Jan. 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By dismissing the case, the judges also rejected that
request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The groups, in one of the financial industry&#8217;s highest-
profile efforts to weaken last year&#8217;s Dodd-Frank law, filed
lawsuits challenging the rule in two federal courts in
Washington last month. The district court lawsuit had been put
on hold while the appeals court considered the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They argue that the CFTC used a flawed analysis of Dodd-
Frank when it decided to impose the restrictions. The
associations also said the CFTC failed to properly weigh the
rule&#8217;s costs and benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Adamske, a CFTC spokesman, declined to comment on
the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ira Hammerman, general counsel for the Securities Industry
and Financial Markets Association, said the association &#8220;will
move forward quickly in the district court.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The court&#8217;s ruling is entirely procedural, and was not a
decision about the merits of our challenge or of our request for
a stay,&#8221; Hammerman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Kennedy, a spokesman for the International Swaps and
Derivatives Association Inc., didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a
phone message seeking comment after business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two associations represent JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS), among other banks
and asset managers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is International Swaps and Derivatives Association
v. CFTC, 11-01491, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Defends Use of Wiretap Evidence in Rajat Gupta Prosecution &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. prosecutors opposed a bid by former Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. director Rajat Gupta to block use in his criminal
case of wiretap evidence obtained from the mobile phone of
convicted inside trader Raj Rajaratnam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six different judges authorized the wiretaps because they
are particularly appropriate in investigating insider trading,
which requires communication and is often difficult to detect
and prove beyond a reasonable doubt, the government said Jan. 19
in a filing opposing Gupta&#8217;s request to suppress the evidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In an effort to suppress incriminating wiretap evidence
against him, Gupta has mimicked Rajaratnam&#8217;s arguments in
Rajaratnam&#8217;s failed attempt to suppress the wiretap evidence,&#8221;
prosecutors said in the filing in federal court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta, who also sat on the board of Procter  Gamble Co.
and led McKinsey  Co., was indicted by a federal grand jury in
October on five counts of securities fraud and one count of
conspiracy to commit securities fraud for passing inside
information to Rajaratnam. Gupta also faces a lawsuit filed by
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, the former Galleon Group LLC hedge fund
manager, was convicted last year of directing the biggest
insider-trading ring in a generation. It was one of the first
insider-trading cases in which the government made extensive use
of wiretaps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary Naftalis, a lawyer for Gupta, didn&#8217;t return a call
seeking comment on the government&#8217;s filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Gupta, 11-cr-00907, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple, Microsoft Patent Lawyers Spend Fridays in Mannheim &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were searching for Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s European patent
lawyers on a Friday, you would have better luck looking in the
German city of Mannheim than on the golf course or in a pub,
Bloomberg News&#8217; Karin Matussek reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judges in the southwest German city hold most patent
hearings on the last day of the week and will issue rulings in
smartphone disputes involving Apple, Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) and
Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. over four of the five Fridays
that began Jan. 20. The city, along with Dusseldorf and Munich,
has become the center of European patent litigation as companies
seek quick rulings from German judges that influence courts
throughout the continent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you have a big multinational corporation setting up a
patent litigation strategy for Europe, they will almost always
sue in Germany,&#8221; said Rowan Freeland, a litigator at Simmons 
Simmons LLP in London. &#8220;Maybe you add other countries as well,
but if you have to choose, it&#8217;s almost certainly Germany.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile device makers filed dozens of cases in the three
cities last year. Samsung lost Jan. 20 a patent-infringement
suit filed against Apple in the Mannheim court. The judges also
heard another suit between the two rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung said it was disappointed by the Jan. 20 ruling and
added that the decision isn&#8217;t indicative for other pending
cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany&#8217;s role in the European economy is just as important
as the speed of the rulings, issued by specialist judges, said
Peter-Michael Weisse, an attorney at intellectual-property
litigation firm Wildanger in Dusseldorf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you want to conquer the European market and you&#8217;re
being stopped in Germany, most of the time that&#8217;s enough to
throw in the towel,&#8221; Weisse said. &#8220;Many companies say if they
cannot sell in Germany, it&#8217;s no use to go ahead with a product
somewhere else.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London and The Hague, Netherlands, compete with Germany as
venues for European patent litigation. The Netherlands&#8217;
disadvantage is a smaller economy, while the U.K. is hindered by
high legal costs, Freeland said. While there is no pan-European
patent, courts often look for similar rulings in other
countries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.K. Tabloid Publisher Loses Ruling Over Secret Evidence &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The publisher of the Daily Mail tabloid in Britain lost a
lawsuit to ban the use of anonymous evidence by journalists at a
judge-led inquiry into media ethics, set up after News Corp.&#8217;s
phone-hacking scandal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling Jan. 20 in London allows unnamed reporters and
editors to allege illegal practices at newspapers other than
News Corp.&#8217;s now-shuttered News of the World tabloid. Associated
Newspapers Ltd. (DMGT), a unit of Daily Mail and General Trust Plc,
sued the inquiry over claims that anonymous statements would be
unfair and risk hurting other tabloids&#8217; reputations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Associated Newspapers also publishes the Mail on Sunday and
Metro in the U.K. The Daily Mail&#8217;s editor, Paul Dacre, has been
a critic of the inquiry, saying in October that phone hacking at
the News of the World exposed police failures in past
investigations rather than a need for more industry regulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public interest in the inquiry&#8217;s chairman &#8220;being able
to pursue his terms of reference as widely and deeply as he
considers necessary is of the utmost importance,&#8221; Judge Roger
Toulson said in the judgment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for victims of phone hacking say journalists who
wish to expose wrongdoing at their newspapers should be free to
do so without fear of a backlash. The names of the newspapers
will also be left out of the statements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inquiry, led by Judge Brian Leveson, was announced in
July by U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron after revelations that
the News of the World hacked into the voice mail of a murdered
school girl in 2002, when she was missing. The probe extends
beyond News Corp. (NWSA)&#8217;s five-year-old scandal, covering the ethics
of the press and its relationship with politicians and police. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stanford Investors Endure &#8216;Living Hell&#8217; on Eve of Trial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R. Allen Stanford&#8217;s investors, after waiting three years to
see the Texas financier go to trial on charges of leading a $7
billion fraud, must hold on even longer before learning when
they will get some of their money back, Bloomberg News&#8217; Andrew
Harris and Laurel Brubaker Calkins report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford&#8217;s customers have received nothing since the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission closed his businesses in
February 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford, accused of misleading people who bought
certificates of deposit from his Antigua-based bank, spent their
money on bad investments, sports sponsorships and a lavish
lifestyle that included yachts, a fleet of jets, mansions and a
private Caribbean island, U.S. prosecutors said. Jury selection
in his criminal trial is scheduled to start Jan. 23 in federal
court in Houston. Stanford, who denies any wrongdoing, faces as
long as 20 years in prison if convicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not fair that we have to be put through this living
hell,&#8221; said Blaine Smith of Louisiana, who claims to have lost
$1 million in life savings invested with Stanford. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A court-appointed receiver for Stanford Group Co. has spent
at least $103 million on litigation, wind-down costs and other
expenses, while collecting less than $212 million in cash and
material assets since the SEC sued Stanford in February 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expenditures include professional fees and expenses of
$52.1 million through October, with $1.3 million of this going
to receiver Ralph Janvey&#8217;s firm, Dallas-based Krage  Janvey
LLP, according to a Bloomberg review of court records. That sum
covers the $21.3 million Janvey asked court permission to pay
his primary outside law firm, Houston-based Baker Botts LLP, for
work done from Feb. 17, 2009, to Sept. 30, 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Stanford, repayment processes have moved forward for
claimants in the Bernard L. Madoff fraud case and the bankruptcy
of MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ), the parent of commodities broker MF
Global Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An attorney for Janvey said that it&#8217;s too soon to say when
investors may see some of the money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC case is Securities and Exchange Commission v.
Stanford International Bank Ltd., 09-cv-00298, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of Texas (Dallas). The criminal case is
U.S. v. Stanford, 09-cr-00342, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of Texas (Houston). The receivership jurisdiction case
is In re Stanford International Bank Ltd., 3:09-cv-00721, U.S.

&lt;p&gt;U.K. Judge Tells Merrill, UBS to Seek Lombardy Swaps Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit and UBS AG (UBSN) must
try to reach an out-of-court resolution to their dispute with
the Italian Region of Lombardy over interest-rate transactions,
a London judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Nigel Teare granted an order for alternative dispute
resolution at a hearing Jan. 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merrill and UBS sued Lombardy in the U.K. in 2010 to uphold
derivatives contracts sold to the region. Lombardy, the northern
Italian region where Milan is located, accused the banks of
fraud and hidden fees, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italian local governments including Tuscany, Lazio,
Piedmont and Florence have challenged investment banks in the
courts over derivatives contracts which turned out to cost more
than expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS lawyer Sonia Tolaney said at the Jan. 20 hearing the
Zurich-based bank had restarted informal negotiations with
Lombardy in December. Richard Handyside, an attorney for New
York-based Merrill, said the bank wasn&#8217;t currently in talks with
the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Merrill case is Merrill Lynch International Bank Ltd.
v. The Region of Lombardy, 10-828, High Court of Justice,
Queen&#8217;s Bench Division, Commercial Court. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-UBS Client Heller Gets 45-Day Jail Term for Tax Evasion &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Heller, a disbarred New York maritime lawyer, was
sentenced to 45 days in jail for using an offshore UBS AG
account to hide income from U.S. tax authorities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heller, 82, who pleaded guilty in June to three counts of
tax evasion for the years 2006, 2007 and 2008, was sentenced
Jan. 20 by U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel in Manhattan. The
parties agreed that the amount of taxes Heller avoided was
between $400,000 and $1 million. He also paid a $9.8 million
penalty to the Internal Revenue Service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heller, who faced as long as 15 years in prison, has
cancer, memory loss and other physical and mental problems,
according to a defense filing in which his lawyers asked that he
not be imprisoned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heller is &#8220;an elderly man at the end of his life who is in
almost constant pain and is faced with ever-mounting physical
disability,&#8221; defense lawyers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citing Heller&#8217;s health, prosecutors recommended a sentence
shorter than the 30 to 37 months that both sides agreed would be
called for under federal sentencing guidelines, which are
nonbinding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heller was one of seven ex-clients of Zurich-based UBS
arrested on the same day in 2010 and charged with hiding more
than $100 million from the IRS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS admitted in February 2009 that it helped U.S. clients
evade taxes. The bank avoided prosecution by paying a $780
million fine and turning over the names of U.S. account holders
to investigators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Heller, 10-mg-742, U.S. District Court,

&lt;p&gt;Boeing to Pay U.S. $4.4 Million to End Chinook Billing Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boeing Co. (BA), the second-largest defense contractor, agreed
to pay the U.S. $4.4 million to resolve allegations that it
overbilled the government for work on Chinook military
helicopters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement requires Boeing to retrain its employees and
make improvements to software it uses to track its billing,
Philadelphia U.S. Attorney Zane Memeger said Jan. 20 in a
statement. A whistle-blower lawsuit alerted the government to
the issue, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some of the most important cases begin with a citizen who
sees something wrong and speaks up,&#8221; Memeger said in the
statement. &#8220;Whistle-blowers who notify the government of
possible fraud allow us both to correct that specific problem
and to prevent similar misconduct from recurring in the
future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department awarded Boeing a contract in
2003 to produce and modify new Chinook helicopters as part of
the Army&#8217;s effort to modernize its fleet. More than 100 Chinooks
were ordered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A government probe revealed that Boeing managers instructed
mechanics to perform non-billable work while separately billing
the U.S. for their time, resulting in the government being
charged for work for which it had already paid, according to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damien Mills, a spokesman at Boeing&#8217;s Chinook plant in
Ridley Park, Pennsylvania, said the company cooperated fully
with the government&#8217;s investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As the investigation revealed, this is a matter of
inadequate charging discipline in the past, not of any
deliberate wrongdoing,&#8221; Mills said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. The Boeing Co., 10-cv-00634, U.S.
District Court Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lehman Pays More Than $500 Million to Marsal Firm in 39&#189;Months &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) has paid more than $500
million in fees to restructuring firm Alvarez  Marsal LLC in 39
1/2 months, according to a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm, whose co-founder Bryan Marsal runs the defunct
investment bank, charged $504.2 million through December for
&#8220;interim management,&#8221; including $8 million last month,
according to the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman, which has spent almost $1.6 billion on fees since
filing the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history in September 2008,
paid $54.1 million to lawyers and managers in December,
according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman&#8217;s bankruptcy became America&#8217;s most costly in April
2010, when it surpassed the $757 million cost of Enron Corp. (ENRNQ)&#8217;s
three-year liquidation, according to data assembled by
bankruptcy professor Lynn LoPucki at the University of
California, Los Angeles. The failed energy trader&#8217;s investors
were paid 53 cents on the dollar, while Lehman&#8217;s $65 billion
liquidation plan would give the average creditor less than 18
cents, according to court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Weil, Gotshal  Manges LLP, Lehman&#8217;s lead
bankruptcy law firm, has earned $375.1 million, including $8.5
million in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marsal, who bills Lehman hourly, has said he will start
distributing some cash to the defunct investment bank&#8217;s
creditors by next year, more than three years after the
bankruptcy filing. He has court approval for the $65 billion
liquidation plan that intends to raise about $40 billion in the
next few years, excluding cash on hand, according to court
papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest
and most profitable U.S. bank, cut the stock awarded to Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon&#8217;s operating committee 15 percent
as the value of the firm&#8217;s shares fell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon&#8217;s top 13 executives collected $60.9 million in
restricted shares plus stock options for their performance in
2011, according to regulatory filings. That compares with $71.4
million of stock granted to 14 people who served on the
committee in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The restricted stock averaged $4.7 million per executive as
of the Jan. 18 award date, compared with $5.1 million a year
earlier when New York-based JPMorgan&#8217;s shares were higher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reductions show JPMorgan&#8217;s top managers aren&#8217;t immune
from pay cuts being felt across Wall Street, said Frank Glassner, chief executive officer of Veritas Executive
Compensation Consultants in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley is cutting pay for senior investment bankers
and traders an average of 20 percent to 30 percent, people with
knowledge of the decision said last week. Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. reduced its compensation and benefits expense 21 percent to
$12.2 billion in 2011 as revenue slid 26 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan fell 22 percent in 2011, outperforming the 25
percent decline in the KBW Bank Index. Goldman Sachs and Morgan
Stanley, both based in New York, dropped more than 40 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, whose 2011 pay held steady at about $23 million,
shrank the size of his operating committee by one as Jay Mandelbaum and Heidi Miller stepped down to pursue other
interests. Charlie Scharf, the former retail division CEO, was
removed in June when his duties were reassigned and he was
transferred to the private-equity unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petno, Hogan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doug Petno, who now runs commercial banking, and John Hogan, Dimon&#8217;s new chief risk officer, joined the committee when
they were promoted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s board increased restricted shares awarded to the
committee to 1.71 million from 1.63 million in 2010 and boosted
options to 2.05 million from 1.62 million, filings show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restricted shares encourage executives to stay at a firm
while minimizing the chances of their compensation being wiped
out, Glassner said. Options, which let executives buy shares at
pre-set prices, are riskier because they can lose all value if
the stock falls. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Citigroup Inc. sold $1 billion of commercial-mortgage bonds in
the year&#8217;s first offering, according to people familiar with the
deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top-ranked portion maturing in about 10 years yields
120 basis points more than the benchmark swap rate, said the
people, who declined to be identified because terms aren&#8217;t
public. Securities rated BBB-, the lowest investment-grade
ranking, yield 790 basis points more than the benchmark, the
people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal is the first since banks pulled back from making
new loans to package into bonds in July as Europe&#8217;s debt crisis
roiled credit markets and sent spreads soaring. Originations
have since picked up, according to a Standard  Poor&#8217;s report
last month. The ratings company is forecasting $35 billion in
2012 sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to hold top-ranked
commercial-mortgage bonds rather than Treasuries has declined to
2.3 percentage points as of yesterday from 2.61 percentage
points at the end of December, according to the Barclays Capital
CMBS AAA Super Duper Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relative yields on commercial mortgage bonds determine how
attractive Wall Street rates are for property owners and drive
the velocity of new offerings. Sales of the debt reached a
record $234 billion in 2007, Bloomberg data show. Issuance
tumbled to $12.2 billion in 2008 as credit markets seized. The
market stayed shut until November 2009. Banks arranged $28
billion in 2011, compared with $11.5 billion in 2010, Bloomberg
data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spread on top-ranked commercial-mortgage bonds was as
narrow as 60 basis points more than Treasuries when sales peaked
in 2007, and as wide as 14.92 percentage points in November 200
in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acura Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ACUR), a maker
of technology to deter drug abuse, rose after its short-acting
painkiller marketed by Pfizer Inc. (PFE) became commercially
available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acura gained 8.1 percent to $4.02 at 4 p.m. in New York.
The shares have gained 33 percent in the last 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short-acting oxycodone pill Oxecta with tamper-
resistant properties uses Acura&#8217;s Aversion Technology,
exclusively licensed to Pfizer in the U.S., Canada and Mexico,
the Palatine, Illinois-based company said yesterday in a
statement. Acura receives royalties from 5 percent to 25 percent
for the drug, which will be sold in bottles of 100 tablets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The commercial availability of Oxecta is an important
milestone and we are pleased Pfizer continues to advance the
commercialization plan for Oxecta,&#8221; said Bob Jones, chief
executive officer of Acura, in the news release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxteca acts in a manner similar to opioids and narcotics to
help ease people from addiction, the company said in a
statement. The tablet includes technology that makes it
difficult to abuse or misuse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s strategy to keep its
market share of cholesterol pill Lipitor may boost revenue
without aiding profit, said the chief executive officer of
Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI), the drugmaker&#8217;s partner on the
medicine&#8217;s generic version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s plan to hold off generic competition may be
failing, said Paul Bisaro, Watson&#8217;s CEO. Pfizer, the world&#8217;s
largest drugmaker, gave Parsippany, New Jersey-based Watson the
right to sell an &#8220;authorized&#8221; copy of Lipitor for a share of
the revenue generated by the generic drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re starting to lose market share,&#8221; Bisaro said
today at a company meeting with analysts. &#8220;It appeared they
were trying to protect revenue and not profit,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipitor (PHAM1150), with $10.7 billion in sales in 2010, began facing
generic versions made by Watson and Punjab, India-based Ranbaxy
Laboratories Ltd. (RBXY) last month in the U.S. after the medicine&#8217;s
patent protection expired. New York-based Pfizer reached
agreements with insurers such as UnitedHealth Group Inc. and
Coventry Health Care Inc. to block sales of the copycat pills in
return for rebates or price cuts on Lipitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t ever make it work that the discounts they
were doing to get market share were better than what they&#8217;d get
if they just allowed their authorized partner sell the
product,&#8221; Bisaro said. &#8220;People have to decide, on a brand
perspective, whether it was actually worth it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market Numbers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s market share has dropped to 32 percent in the
seventh week of competition from 41 percent in the second week,
according to data from IMS Health analyzed by Jami Rubin, an
analyst with Goldman Sachs in New York. &#8220;PFE&#8217;s share may be
starting to slip,&#8221; Rubin said in a note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson fell 2.3 percent to $55.89 at 4 p.m. New York time.
Pfizer declined less than 1 percent to $21.66. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s strategy &#8220;is designed to increase patient choice
and improve patient adherence by offering Lipitor patients more
support than they would receive from a company selling generic
atorvastatin,&#8221; said Mackay Jimeson, a spokesman for Pfizer, in
an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson plans to spend on acquisitions to diversify into
brand-name drugs, rather than share buybacks or a dividend,
Bisaro said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Over time our investor base will appreciate the assets we
have in our portfolio,&#8221; Bisaro said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Jan. 20, Watson failed to win the support of a panel
advising the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on the company&#8217;s
pre-term birth gel. The FDA is scheduled to decide whether to
approve the drug by Feb. 26. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s prospects
have improved as the risk of a European bank meltdown eases and
the firm adapts to structural changes in the market, JMP
Securities analyst David Trone said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a meeting yesterday with Goldman Sachs Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar, Trone said he was &#8220;more
optimistic about near-term prospects than we have been in
sometime.&#8221; He said today in a note to clients that he sees
&#8220;some upward bias&#8221; to his earnings estimates for New York-
based Goldman Sachs, which last week posted a smaller decline in
fourth-quarter profit than analysts predicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings reports from the six largest U.S. banks showed the
industry suffered a third straight quarterly drop in combined
trading and investment-banking revenue, raising concern that the
slowdown is more than just a temporary rut and may signal a
lasting shift to smaller volumes, profits and pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executives and analysts are focusing on whether stiffer
regulations, capital rules and a weak economy may solidify a
decline in revenue after the European debt crisis curbed trading
volume and corporate dealmaking in last year&#8217;s second half.
Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), UBS AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc, which are all shrinking their investment banks, have
announced plans to eliminate about 8,300 jobs since the start of
November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trone said Goldman Sachs&#8217;s &#8220;adaptability&#8221; makes him
&#8220;bullish&#8221; about the company&#8217;s long-term prospects and supports
his view that the franchise &#8220;has a competitive and profitable
future.&#8221; Goldman Sachs said revenue will rise when the markets
rebound, boosting pay for investment bankers, according to
Trone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JMP has a &#8220;market outperform&#8221; rating on Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
stock, which gained 20 percent this year through yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkish two-year bond yields
retreated to the lowest in more than five weeks as the Treasury
paid the least to borrow at an auction since October and
JPMorgan Chase  Co. upgraded local bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on two-year notes fell for a second day, slipping
six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 10.24 percent at
1:29 p.m. in Istanbul, a Turk Ekonomi Bankasi AS index of the
securities showed. That extended this year&#8217;s drop to 77 basis
points, the biggest monthly decline in five months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Treasury sold a total of 4.66 billion liras ($2.6
billion) in benchmark bonds maturing 2013 at 10.28 percent
today. This compares with two-year debt sold at 10.59 percent in
November and 10.34 percent in December. Turkey&#8217;s local bonds
were raised to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;underweight&#8221; at JPMorgan,
which cited a &#8220;favorable&#8221; domestic and global backdrop in an
e-mailed report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is a success for the Treasury,&#8221; Suha Yaygin, deputy
chief of emerging markets trading at Toronto-Dominion Bank in
London, said in e-mailed comments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on Turkey&#8217;s benchmark debt soared 390 basis points
last year, the most since 2006, as the lira weakened 18 percent
against the dollar in the biggest depreciation worldwide and a
widening current-account deficit hurt investor confidence in the
nation&#8217;s financial stability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest Rate &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkey&#8217;s central bank kept its one-week repo rate at a
record low today, maintaining the floor of the interest-rate
corridor it has used to support the lira and control inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It held the rate at 5.75 percent, the Ankara-
based lender said on its website today. That matched the
estimate of all 11 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The bank
will release minutes of the monetary policy committee&#8217;s meeting
within five working days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkey will halt sales of dollars in regular daily auctions
from tomorrow, the central bank said in an e-mailed statement.
It may hold auctions of as much as $500 million per day when
deemed necessary, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 100 bankers claim
Commerzbank AG (CBK) broke a pledge by Dresdner Bank, which it bought
in 2009, to set aside about $516 million for bonuses and are
asking a U.K. court this week to order that they be paid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the trial, scheduled to begin tomorrow in London, the
former Dresdner bankers seek about 50 million euros ($64.5
million), with individual payouts of as much as 2 million euros.
The suit is the largest in the U.K. over bonus cuts resulting
from the financial crisis following the bankruptcy of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After buying the bank, Commerzbank slashed by as much as 90
percent bonuses promised to workers by former Dresdner Chief
Executive Officer Stefan Jentzsch, the claimants said in court
papers. Germany&#8217;s second biggest lender argues it shouldn&#8217;t have
to make the payments because of record losses at Dresdner after
Lehman&#8217;s demise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Commerzbank will show that Dresdner Bank was entitled to
reduce its employees&#8217; 2008 discretionary bonuses in the light of
the significant deterioration in the investment bank&#8217;s
performance in late 2008,&#8221; it said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Witnesses at the Dresdner trial will include Jentzsch and
current Commerzbank CEO Martin Blessing, along with current and
former Dresdner employees. Commerzbank has already faced other
lawsuits in London, Germany and Singapore from workers who said
they weren&#8217;t paid what they were due after the 2009 takeover. It
won the German case and has settled others in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases include Fahmi Anar  Others v. Dresdner Kleinwort
Ltd., Commerzbank AG, High Court of Justice, Queen&#8217;s Bench
Division, HQ09X05230 and Richard Attrill  71 others v. Dresdner

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Sued by John Hancock Over Mortgage Securities &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. was sued by Manulife Financial Corp.&#8217;s
John Hancock Life Insurance unit, which accused the bank of
fraud in connection with the sale of residential mortgage-backed
securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed yesterday in New York state Supreme
Court in Manhattan, seeks unspecified damages for losses of
market value and principal and interest payments, as well as
rescission and recovery of payment for the investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Hancock bought the securities &#8220;in reliance on the
false and misleading&#8221; statements made by the defendants, which
include Bear Stearns  Co. and Washington Mutual Inc. (WAMUQ), both of
which were acquired by JPMorgan, lawyers for the Boston-based
insurer said in the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Based on these material misrepresentations and omissions,
plaintiffs purchased securities that were far riskier than had
been represented, backed by mortgage loans worth significantly
less than had been represented, and that had been made to
borrowers who were much less creditworthy than had been
represented,&#8221; attorneys for John Hancock said in the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
biggest recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
and the crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the
market for the securities evaporated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is John Hancock Life Insurance Co. v. JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM), 650195/2012, New York state Supreme Court
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) Sued by Sealink Over Mortgage Securities &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley was sued by Sealink Funding Ltd., which
accused the bank of fraud in connection with more than $556
million in residential mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sealink, a fund created to manage Landesbank Sachsen AG&#8217;s
riskiest assets after the German lender almost collapsed, filed
the lawsuit in New York state Supreme Court in Manhattan on Jan.
20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The securities were bought between 2006 and 2007 using
information provided by Morgan Stanley, which said it had
conducted due diligence on the lenders of the mortgages on which
the investments were based and assured Sealink that the loans
met underwriting standards and deserved the AAA ratings they
were assigned, lawyers for Sealink said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In truth, and as Sealink and the world would only later
discover, the originators whose loans collateralized the Morgan
Stanley RMBS at issue were among the worst of the worst culprits
in the subprime lending industry,&#8221; Sealink said in the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lauren Onis, a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley, didn&#8217;t
immediately comment on the lawsuit in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sealink filed similar suits against JPMorgan Chase  Co.
and Bank of America&#8217;s Countrywide unit in September. Pools of
home loans securitized into bonds were a central part of the
housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the biggest
recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed, and the
crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the market for
the securities evaporated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Sealink Funding Ltd. v. Morgan Stanley,
650196/2012, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macy&#8217;s Sues Martha Stewart Living Over Exclusivity Agreement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macy&#8217;s Inc. (M) sued Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc.
seeking to enforce an agreement allowing its department stores
exclusive rights to sell certain Martha Stewart-branded
products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The retailer filed a complaint in New York State Supreme
Court in Manhattan yesterday aimed at stopping New York-based
Martha Stewart Living from executing a new sales agreement with
J.C. Penney Co., according to court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macy&#8217;s, based in Cincinnati, renewed a 2006 agreement for
Martha Stewart-branded products, such as cookware, kitchen
utensils and bed and bath items, for another five years, Jim
Sluzewski, a spokesman for the retailer, said in an e-mail. It
expires in January 2018, Sluzewski said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit seeks to enforce the agreement &#8220;in which the
right for Macy&#8217;s to sell product exclusively in these categories
was clearly outlined,&#8221; Sluzewski said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Macy&#8217;s plans to fully support its exclusive Martha
Stewart-branded product going forward,&#8221; Sluzewski said.
&#8220;Martha Stewart is among a wide range of leading brands offered
in Macy&#8217;s home store and we will continue to expand and improve
our home offering based on localized customer preferences across
the country.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeanne Meyer, a Martha Stewart Living spokeswoman, said in
an e-mail that the company &#8220;typically doesn&#8217;t comment on legal
matters.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Macy&#8217;s Inc. v. Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia (MSO)
Inc., 650197/2012, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreclosure Deal Won&#8217;t Be Reached This Week, Miller Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller said a deal with the five
biggest U.S. mortgage servicers to resolve a probe of
foreclosure practices won&#8217;t be reached this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State and federal officials have been negotiating a
settlement with the five largest mortgage servicers -- Bank of
America Corp., JPMorgan Chase  Co., Citigroup Inc. (C), Wells Fargo
 Co. (WFC) and Ally Financial Inc (ALLY). Representatives of Democratic
attorney general offices met yesterday at a Chicago hotel to
discuss a proposed accord. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal with the banks would be worth about $25 billion,
two people familiar with the matter said last week. That would
drop to about $19 billion if California Attorney General Kamala
Harris decides not to sign on, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have not yet reached an agreement with the nation&#8217;s
five largest servicers, and we won&#8217;t reach a settlement any time
this week,&#8221; Miller, who has been leading the negotiations for
the states, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks would fund loan principal writedowns for homeowners
and provide refinancing, the people said. The proposal also sets
requirements for how to conduct home foreclosures. Delaware
Attorney General Beau Biden, a Democrat, won&#8217;t sign on to the
proposed foreclosure settlement as currently drafted, Deputy
Attorney General Ian McConnel said in a phone interview
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s meeting in Chicago is an opportunity for
officials at Democratic attorney general offices to ask
questions before they are asked to decide whether to sign on.
Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan, who is
also attending, declined to comment during a break. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attorneys general from all 50 states announced in 2010
they were investigating bank foreclosure practices after
disclosures that the companies were using faulty documents in
seizing homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mets Owners to Ask Judge to Decide Madoff Trustee Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owners of the New York Mets baseball team will ask a
Manhattan judge to decide remaining claims of $386 million in a
suit from Irving Picard, the trustee for Bernard Madoff&#8217;s
defunct firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff threw out most of Picard&#8217;s
$1 billion claims against the team owners and this month refused
to let the trustee appeal his ruling before a March jury trial.
The Mets owners, Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz, will ask Rakoff next
month for judgment on all remaining counts of Picard&#8217;s
complaint, they said in a Jan. 20 court filing. Picard said
separately he wants a ruling before trial on one remaining count
of his lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York lawyer Picard originally demanded $300 million in
profit and $700 million in principal from Wilpon, Katz and a
group of family members and related entities, saying they turned
a blind eye to Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme. The partners denied the
allegation. In September, Rakoff dismissed all or part of nine
out of 11 claims in Picard&#8217;s suit against Wilpon and Katz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denying Picard&#8217;s request to let him appeal this month,
Rakoff, a fan of the New York Yankees, cited a quotation usually
attributed to that team&#8217;s Hall of Fame catcher, Yogi Berra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. Katz, 11-cv-03605, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Megaupload Founder Bail Delayed After Guns, Pink Cadillac Seized &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Megaupload.com&#8217;s founder was ordered by a New Zealand judge
to remain in jail, three days after the U.S. shut down the file-
sharing website and police arrested him in his mansion, seizing
luxury cars, guns and art. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim Dotcom, the website&#8217;s German founder who legally
changed his name from Schmitz, was remanded to Jan. 25, when the
judge is scheduled to rule on his bail request, a court official
said by telephone. Dotcom and three other men appeared in court
in Albany, a suburb of Auckland, on U.S. charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police used helicopters in the raid on the so-called Dotcom
Mansion on Jan. 20, the eve of Dotcom&#8217;s 38th birthday, after the
U.S. government charged seven men in an alleged $175 million
copyright infringement conspiracy. Megaupload was advertised as
having more than 1 billion visitors, more than 150 million
users, 50 million daily visitors, and accounted for 4 percent of
Internet traffic, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When police arrived at Dotcom&#8217;s leased Auckland home, he
entered his house and activated electronic locks, New Zealand
police said in the statement. They neutralized locks and cut
their way into a safe room, where Dotcom was found with what
looked like a sawed-off shotgun, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He denied any wrong doing at yesterday&#8217;s hearing, according
to stuff.co.nz website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutor Anne Toohey urged the judge to deny Dotcom&#8217;s
request for bail, saying he was a flight risk, stuff.co.nz
reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rajat Gupta Files Demand for Jury Trial in SEC Civil Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajat Gupta, the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) director
charged with insider trading as part of the Galleon Group LLC
probe, filed a demand for a jury trial in the civil case brought
against him by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC claims Gupta, 63, gave Raj Rajaratnam, the
convicted Galleon co-founder, information about Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)&#8217;s $5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs. The
agency also alleges that Gupta told Rajaratnam about quarterly
earnings of Goldman Sachs and Procter  Gamble, where Gupta was
also a director. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta, who faces related criminal charges in a separate
case, has denied wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC filed an administrative proceeding against Gupta in
Washington on March 1, claiming he passed illegal inside
information to Rajaratnam. The agency later withdrew that action
and sued Gupta in federal court in Manhattan, after Gupta
claimed the administrative proceeding improperly deprived him of
procedural protections, including the right to have a jury,
rather than a judge, determine the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, 54, was found guilty in May of 14 criminal
counts of conspiracy and securities fraud. He is serving an 11-
year sentence in a federal medical prison in Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Gupta v. SEC, 11-cv-01900, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC Withdraws Madoff Settlement Offer After Case Dismissed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA), Europe&#8217;s largest lender, withdrew a
settlement offer with investors in a feeder fund that lost money
in Bernard Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme after a U.S. court dismissed
the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The individual investors in 2009 sued Thema International
Fund Plc and 27 other defendants, including HSBC, Thema&#8217;s
custodian bank, alleging the bank should have known of Madoff&#8217;s
fraud. HSBC asked the court to dismiss the case in October,
saying it should be heard in Ireland and Luxembourg. The court
yesterday found Ireland was a &#8220;more appropriate forum,&#8221; the
London-based lender said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 73, pleaded guilty in 2009 to orchestrating what
prosecutors called the biggest Ponzi scheme in history. He is
serving a 150-year sentence in a federal prison in North
Carolina. HSBC amended its settlement with the investors in
November after the bank&#8217;s original offer was rejected by a U.S.
judge two months earlier. The proposal offered shareholders in
Thema as much as $62.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court &#8220;declined to consider whether to grant approval
of the proposed settlement between HSBC and the plaintiff, as
was required for the settlement to become effective,&#8221; the bank
said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In light of the court&#8217;s decisions, HSBC has terminated
the settlement agreement,&#8221; the lender said. &#8220;The plaintiff
contests HSBC&#8217;s right to terminate and has appealed the court&#8217;s
decisions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venezuela Rebuffed by U.S. High Court on Bandagro Bond Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court (1000L) refused to block an Ohio investor
group from suing Venezuela over potentially $900 million in bank
notes that the South American country says are forgeries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices yesterday turned away an appeal from Hugo
Chavez&#8217;s Venezuelan government, which sought to invoke a U.S.
law that immunizes foreign sovereigns from some lawsuits in
American courts. The Supreme Court acted after the Obama
administration urged rejection of the appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit by DRFP LLC, which does business under the name
Skye Ventures, may be the first of several claims over the
disputed bearer bonds, according to Venezuela&#8217;s appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notes were allegedly issued in 1981 by the Banco de
Desarrollo Agropecuario, then a state-owned Venezuelan bank also
known as Bandagro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two Skye Ventures notes have a face value of $50
million apiece. The investor group said in 2010 that, with
interest, the bonds were worth as much as $900 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skye Ventures says it acquired its two notes only after the
Venezuelan attorney general issued a 2003 opinion declaring them
valid. The investor group then demanded payment in Columbus.
When Venezuela refused, Skye sued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal appeals court in Cincinnati ruled in 2010 that
Venezuela isn&#8217;t shielded by the U.S. Foreign Sovereign
Immunities Act. The court left open the possibility that
Venezuela could win dismissal of the case using a different line
of argument. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela v. DRFP,
10-1144, U.S. Supreme Court, (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allen Stanford&#8217;s Prospective Jurors Probed for Bias by Judge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The R. Allen Stanford who arrived at the Houston federal
courthouse in shackles to start his $7 billion investment fraud
trial yesterday is far different from the Texas billionaire
prosecutors indicted 2 1/2 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weeks before his June 2009 indictment, Stanford strode into
the same courthouse with a high-profile defense lawyer and
volunteered to surrender. U.S. marshals declined at the time to
arrest the Stanford Group Co. founder, then estimated by Forbes
to be worth $2.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m not a damn swindler,&#8221; Stanford said weeks before he
was charged. He vowed to clear his name, take back assets seized
by securities regulators, and repay more than 20,000 investors
he&#8217;s accused of defrauding through allegedly bogus certificates
of deposit at Antigua-based Stanford International Bank Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now 61 and visibly thinner, Stanford has endured a string
of setbacks since he was indicted and jailed because prosecutors
said he might try to flee. In September 2009, he suffered broken
facial bones in a beating by another inmate and became addicted
to anti-anxiety medications prescribed by prison doctors after
the attack. After eight months in a prison rehabilitation unit,
Stanford claims he still can&#8217;t remember much of his life or
details of his once far-flung business empire, according to his
lawyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge interviewed 80 prospective jurors yesterday,
questioning them to determine possible bias for or against the
former financier. About a fourth of them said they had some
familiarity with Stanford&#8217;s story. By day&#8217;s end, more than half
of the panelists had been sent home, while Hittner detained the
rest for further questioning in his chambers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge told them to return to court today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors accuse Stanford of skimming more than $1
billion in investor deposits to fund a lavish lifestyle --
including yachts, a fleet of jets, cricket teams and a private
Caribbean island -- and to support multiple women, several of
whom crowded into court almost three years ago with their
children to support the financier. The Stanford entourage has
since dwindled to occasional courtroom appearances by his mother
and a lone female admirer, who says she also visits him
regularly in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Houston attorneys Ali Fazel and Robert Scardino, Stanford&#8217;s
lead defense counsel, said they&#8217;ll use thousands of bank and
business records to show jurors the financier never intended to
defraud anyone. They claim no investor lost money until the
government stepped in and seized the businesses, destroying
their value. Stanford International Bank stumbled in the same
global financial meltdown that tripped up banks worldwide in
late 2008, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. Stanford, 09-cr-342, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston). The SEC
case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Stanford
International Bank, 09-cv-298, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of Texas (Dallas). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polly Peck Ex-CEO Nadir Accused at Trial of $233 Million Theft &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asil Nadir, the former Polly Peck International Plc chief
executive who fled Britain in 1993 following claims of fraud,
was accused at a trial in London of stealing 150 million pounds
($233.4 million) from the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount, revealed by prosecutors on the first day of a
four-month trial in London, is more than four times the figure
cited by the Serious Fraud Office since the case began nearly
two decades ago. Nadir, 70, and associates withdrew the money
from the now-defunct electronics and food-packaging firm&#8217;s U.K.
bank accounts and funneled it through companies in Switzerland
and the Bahamas between 1987 and 1990, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nadir &#8220;wielded very considerable power&#8221; over the
company&#8217;s operations and management, prosecutor Philip Shears
said at London&#8217;s Old Bailey criminal court. &#8220;We say he abused
that power and helped himself to tens of millions of pounds of
PPI&#8217;s money.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When London-based Polly Peck collapsed in 1990, its
administrators found more than 700 million pounds owed to
creditors was unrecoverable from units of the company, which
Nadir built up during the 1980s by expanding into areas such as
electronics, hotels and an acquisition of the Del Monte (DLM) fruit
brand. Nadir agreed to return to the U.K. in 2010 to face fraud
claims nearly 20 years after fleeing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SFO accused Nadir of 13 counts of theft totaling about
34 million pounds, using a selection of &#8220;sample&#8221; transfers.
Nadir denies the charges. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diamondback Avoids Prosecution, Agrees to Pay $9 Million &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diamondback Capital Management LLC won&#8217;t be criminally
prosecuted and will pay more than $9 million to end an insider-
trading investigation involving Dell Inc. (DELL) and Nvidia Corp. (NVDA)
stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said his office
agreed not to prosecute Diamondback for the actions of two
former employees, Todd Newman, a former portfolio manager, and
Jesse Tortora, a former analyst. In a complaint filed last week,
prosecutors said the pair and five other men were part of a
&#8220;criminal club&#8221; of fund managers and analysts who swapped
illegal tips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newman, who began working at Diamondback in March 2006, was
charged with conspiracy to commit securities fraud and
securities fraud in the criminal complaint filed by Bharara&#8217;s
office on Jan. 18. Tortora has pleaded guilty and is cooperating
with the U.S., Bharara said. Newman, who hasn&#8217;t entered a plea,
was released on $3 million bond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The misconduct under investigation did not, and does not,
extend beyond the statement of facts and was not known by the
firm&#8217;s co-founders,&#8221; assistant U.S. attorneys Antonia Apps and
David Leibowitz said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawyer hired by Diamondback concluded after an
investigation that certain trades by Newman and Tortora in Dell
and Nvidia resulted from material nonpublic information they
received from an unidentified expert-networking firm,
prosecutors said. The external probe found &#8220;no evidence that
either the conduct or the improper information&#8221; was known by
the firm&#8217;s co-founders, according to prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diamondback yesterday separately agreed to resolve a Jan.
18 Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit over trades made
in 2008 and 2009 by the former employees, the SEC said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC filed claims against Diamondback, Newman and
Tortora last week as part of a wider insider-trading case that
involved five different hedge funds and investment firms. The
agency claimed Newman learned inside information about Dell&#8217;s
earnings in 2008 from Tortora. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Adondakis, 12-cv-409, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;California Slaughterhouse Law Struck Down by Top U.S. Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court overturned a California law
requiring slaughterhouses to immediately euthanize animals that
are too sick to stand up, saying the measure violated a federal
meat-safety law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unanimous ruling yesterday is a victory for the
National Meat Association, an industry trade group that
challenged the California law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because federal law similarly bans the slaughter of downed
cattle for food, the California law would have had its greatest
impact on the handling of pigs. Under federal law, downed hogs
can be slaughtered after they undergo a veterinary check to
ensure they aren&#8217;t diseased. The hogs also must become
ambulatory before they can be slaughtered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state law was enacted in 2008 after the Humane Society
of the United States released a video of so-called downer cattle
being kicked, electrocuted, dragged with chains and rammed with
a forklift at a Westland/Hallmark Meat Co. slaughterhouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The California law banned slaughterhouses from buying or
selling downer animals and from butchering them for human
consumption. The measure also required humane handling of the
animals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration argued alongside the meat-industry
trade group in urging the court to declare the state law &#8220;pre-
empted&#8221; by the federal statute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is National Meat Association v. Harris, 10-224,
U.S. Supreme Court (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christie Nominees to Supreme Court Include First Asian-American &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Jersey Governor Chris Christie said he is nominating
two people to the state Supreme Court, including the first
openly gay justice and the first Asian American. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bruce Harris, a registered Republican and mayor of Chatham,
would be the first openly gay justice and the third black
justice, Christie, a first-term Republican, said yesterday at a
press conference in Trenton. Phil Kwon, who is undeclared, would
be the first Asian-American justice, Christie said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nominations need approval from the Senate, which is
controlled by Democrats. Senate President Stephen Sweeney, a
West Deptford Democrat, held up Christie&#8217;s May 2010 Supreme
Court nomination of Anne Patterson for a year, saying the
governor&#8217;s unprecedented move to deny tenure to a sitting
Supreme Court Justice, John Wallace, had politicized the court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Tara Lachapelle" date="Jan 25, 2012  7:05 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-25/walter-energy-buyers-seen-as-bhp-arcelormittal-converge-on-cheap-real-m-a.html"><headline>Walter Energy Buyer Seen as BHP-ArcelorMittal Converge: Real M&amp;amp;A</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy Inc. (WLT) may finally lure
buyers willing to bet on a recovery in coal prices with the
industry&#8217;s cheapest stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After losing almost half its value in the past year, the
producer of steelmaking coal sold for 9.3 times earnings this
week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That was less
than any North American coal-mining company with $1 billion in
market capitalization. The slide also drove down the value of
Walter Energy to 1.7 times its net assets this month, the lowest
since the last bear market in U.S. equities, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a surge in coal prices last year led to the biggest
wave of coal deals, most acquirers were left with losses as
demand for the commodity collapsed. Walter Energy, which bought
Western Coal Corp. for $5.3 billion in April, is an attractive
target because it produces high-grade steelmaking coal, Brean
Murray Carret  Co. said. A buyer could spend double Walter
Energy&#8217;s closing price of $67.54 a share yesterday and still get
the company for less relative to earnings than any coal takeover
in the past year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Now is the opportune time for a buyer to potentially
start looking at them,&#8221; J. Christopher Haberlin, a Richmond,
Virginia-based analyst at Davenport  Co., said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s some of the best coal in the world and it&#8217;s
what steelmakers want. If somebody did make a run at Walter
here, certainly they could take Walter out a price much lower
than where that valuation may have been.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy may attract interest from BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP),
Anglo American Plc (AAL) or ArcelorMittal, and could command as much
as $120 a share in an acquisition, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Today&#8217;s Trading &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Blalock, a spokesman for Birmingham, Alabama-based
Walter Energy, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kelly Quirke, a spokeswoman at BHP, declined to comment on
whether the Melbourne-based company is considering a bid for
Walter Energy, as did James Wyatt-Tilby, a spokesman for Anglo
American of London. Giles Read of Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal
didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a telephone call or an e-mail
seeking comment outside normal business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy advanced as much as 5.4 percent today before
closing 3.9 percent higher at $70.14 in New York. The shares
fell 45 percent in the past year through yesterday, the biggest
drop in the 34-stock Bloomberg World Coal Index (BWCOAL) apart from two
companies -- Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR) and Arch Coal Inc. (ACI),
the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Earnings Miss &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the decline came after Walter Energy completed its
biggest ever acquisition with its purchase of Western Coal, as
Keith Calder quit as chief executive officer in June after three
months on the job and the company&#8217;s earnings fell short of
analysts&#8217; projections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy plummeted 30 percent on Aug. 4, its biggest
drop since at least March 1995, after second-quarter revenue and
net income trailed estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s fourth-quarter profit forecast in November
also missed analysts&#8217; projections after it suffered a more than
40 percent decline in third-quarter earnings. This month, Walter
Energy cut its coal production forecast for 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The share-price slump, which erased $2.3 billion in Walter
Energy&#8217;s market capitalization in the past year and left it with
a value of $4.2 billion yesterday, pushed down its valuation and
increased speculation it could be vulnerable to a takeover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Relative Value &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 9.3 times earnings, Walter Energy was valued at a 33
percent discount to the industry average for North American coal
mining companies, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Walter Energy
also traded at 1.7 times its assets minus liabilities earlier
this month, about half its valuation in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Walter Energy&#8217;s stock has fallen, its coal is
considered better quality because it&#8217;s purer and has a so-called
higher heat rate, making it desirable for steelmakers that use
it to forge the alloy, according to T. Rowe Price Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy, which has operations in Alabama&#8217;s Blue Creek
seam and added mines in Canada when it bought Vancouver-based
Western Coal, sold its coal for a price of $223 per ton in the
third quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s more than any U.S. coal producer and three times the
average price for the industry, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With prices for steelmaking coal close to &#8220;bottoming,&#8221;
according to an estimate from Raymond James Financial Inc.,
Walter Energy makes sense as an acquisition target, said Lucas Pipes, a New York-based analyst at Brean Murray. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;No Question&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s no question that folks always have MA in the
back of their minds with Walter,&#8221; he said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;They do have high quality met coal reserves and at
least over the last couple of years have enjoyed pretty healthy
prices. Walter&#8217;s reserves definitely hit the parameters in terms
of what potential buyers are looking for.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BHP Billiton, the world&#8217;s biggest mining company, and Anglo
American, which mines for coal, iron ore and diamonds, could
gain Walter Energy&#8217;s mines in Alabama and western Canada, which
are near ports and can help any buyer cut the cost to ship coal
to South America, Europe and Asia, Davenport&#8217;s Haberlin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying Walter Energy would also help ArcelorMittal (MT), the
world&#8217;s largest steelmaker, reduce the amount of coal it needs
to purchase from suppliers, according to Malcolm Polley, who
oversees $1.1 billion as chief investment officer at Stewart
Capital in Indiana, Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It would help ArcelorMittal in terms of becoming a more
vertically integrated producer of steel,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You want
to do it in the case of ArcelorMittal because you want to lock
in a reasonable cost for your met coal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Would Emerge&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Davenport&#8217;s Haberlin estimates that Walter Energy
could command a takeover premium of more than 75 percent,
doubling yesterday&#8217;s price to $135 a share would value the
company at 14 times its earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would still be cheaper than any billion-dollar coal
acquisition last year, when a record $28 billion in company
takeovers were announced in the industry, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy is an &#8220;attractive acquisition,&#8221; said
Davenport&#8217;s Haberlin. &#8220;They do have very good quality coal. It
would be a major global miner or a global steel company that
would emerge as the bidder.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended
its clients buy the Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar versus

interest rates low reaffirms a dollar &#8220;weakening trend.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peso may advance to 12 per dollar from 13.019 today and
the Canadian currency will rise to 95 cents per U.S. dollar from
C$1.0043, analysts led by Thomas Stolper wrote in a note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have argued repeatedly that the broad dollar weakness
theme remains intact as a result of the still very weak U.S.
balance of payments and a very dovish Fed,&#8221; the analysts wrote
today. The Fed&#8217;s pledge today to keep its benchmark borrowing
costs between zero and 0.25 percent until at least late 2014
&#8220;reaffirms our view that the dollar weakening trend is not
over,&#8221; they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mexican peso remains &#8220;cheap&#8221; while the country&#8217;s
balance of payments is &#8220;solid,&#8221; the analysts wrote. In Canada,
policy makers may not follow the Fed in pursuing a more
&#8220;proactive&#8221; monetary policy, the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Treasury and
Securities Services division dismissed about 100 people, less
than 1 percent of the unit&#8217;s workforce, as part of the bank&#8217;s
periodic staff adjustments, said a person briefed on the move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit, which employed 27,825 workers at the end of 2011,
isn&#8217;t planning widespread reductions, the person said, speaking
on condition of anonymity because the move hasn&#8217;t been made
public. The bank informed employees yesterday, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The division, run by Michael Cavanagh, handles payments-
processing and cash-management services for institutional
clients such as MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ), which filed for
bankruptcy Oct. 31. Dealbreaker.com reported earlier today that
the unit was cutting jobs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Americas
Petrogas Inc. (BOE) have &#8220;phenomenal&#8221; tight natural-gas prospects in
Argentina and expect &#8220;explosive&#8221; output growth in 5 years,
said Guimar Vaca Coca, managing director of Americas Petrogas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petrogas expects shale-oil and gas output to reach at least
10,000 barrels a day by 2017, Vaca Coca said in an interview in
Buenos Aires today. The two companies are investing about $50
million to drill wells in Argentina&#8217;s southern Patagonia region
this year and expect to invest $1.5 billion to $2 billion by
that date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argentina&#8217;s shale oil and so-called tight-gas resources may
exceed the 774 trillion cubic feet (21.9 trillion cubic meters)
estimated by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, Vaca
Coca said. Argentina&#8217;s shale resources are the third-largest in
the world after China and the U.S., the EIA said in an April
2011 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the first well we drilled, we found excellent signs of
tight gas,&#8221; Vaca Coca said on the sidelines of an American
Business Conferences event. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to concentrate on
testing the shale-gas prospects first and then we&#8217;ll examine the
tight gas ones.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petrogas rose 2.2 percent to C$3.72 in Toronto. Irving,
Texas-based Exxon gained 0.1 percent to $87.22 in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YPF Discovery &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the largest U.S. oil company, and Calgary-based
Petrogas, are drilling at the same Vaca Muerta formation in the
Neuquen Basin where YPF SA (YPFD), Argentina&#8217;s largest energy company,
made its biggest discovery of 927 million barrels of shale-oil
resources on Nov. 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YPF&#8217;s discovery at the Loma La Lata field in Neuquen
province was six times more than previously estimated. At the
Vaca Muerta formation, 15 wells are producing between 200 and
600 barrels of oil a day, YPF, controlled by Madrid-based Repsol
YPF SA (REP), said in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shale producers use a technique known as hydraulic
fracturing, which involves pumping water, sand and chemicals
underground to extract gas embedded in the rock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon and Petrogas are exploring three wells this year at
the Los Toldos blocks, which cover 163,500 acres in the Neuquen
Basin, and Petrogas is drilling another well in the Yerba Buena
block, Vaca Coca said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petrogas expects to have conventional oil and gas output of
20,000 to 25,000 barrels a day and be one of Argentina&#8217;s top 10
oil producers within 5 years, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s technically recoverable shale-gas resources are
estimated at 1,275 trillion cubic feet, while the U.S. has 862
trillion cubic feet of resources, according to the EIA report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SAB&#8217;s plan to acquire
a 50 percent stake in Grupo Iusacell SA (CEL*) for $1.6 billion was
rejected by Mexico&#8217;s antitrust agency after a nine-month review,
El Universal and Dow Jones Newswires reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Competition Commission&#8217;s board voted 3-2
against the deal yesterday, the newspaper said today on its
website, citing unnamed sources close to the process. The
companies will be able to ask the agency to review its decision,
the newspaper said. Dow Jones also reported the deal was
rejected, citing an unnamed person close to the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the deal is rejected, it would hinder Televisa&#8217;s
aspirations to enter the mobile-phone market and escalate its
rivalry with billionaire Carlos Slim&#8217;s America Movil (AMXL) SAB.
Televisa also has money at stake, having already spent about
$1.2 billion as of September to acquire convertible debt it
planned to turn into Iusacell shares once the transaction was
approved by the government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There won&#8217;t be an official response until we&#8217;ve been
notified and have reviewed the result, as required by various
regulations of public companies,&#8221; Televisa said in an e-mailed
statement. An Iusacell official had no immediate comment. The
antitrust agency said last night in a statement it must notify
the parties before it can officially announce the vote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contradicting Reports &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa dropped 2.1 percent to 54.14 pesos at the close in
Mexico City, the lowest price since Nov. 29. The shares fell 8.1
percent last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two other publications contradicted the reports of the
deal&#8217;s rejection. Proceso magazine and Dario Celis, a columnist
at Excelsior newspaper, said the deal was approved with
unspecified conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iusacell, Mexico&#8217;s third-biggest mobile-phone carrier, may
not survive without the investment, its lawyer Francisco Borrego
said earlier this month. Iusacell is closely held by billionaire
Ricardo Salinas, who also controls TV Azteca SAB, the second-
biggest Mexican broadcaster behind Televisa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alliance would bring the nation&#8217;s two biggest over-the-
air TV networks closer together and could harm competition, said
critics including the Mexican Association for the Right to
Information. Televisa and Salinas&#8217;s group had said they would
continue to compete aggressively in broadcast TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By David Welch" date="Jan 25, 2012  2:32 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-25/wal-mart-pulls-greeters-from-overnight-shift-as-sam-walton-s-legacy-ebbs.html"><headline>Wal-Mart Pulls Night-Shift Greeters as Walton Legacy Ebbs</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), the world&#8217;s
largest retailer, has removed greeters from the overnight shift
at its U.S. supercenters, chipping away at a 30-year tradition
of making sure all shoppers are welcomed to the store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move will save money and ensure Wal-Mart has the right
staffing levels during peak and non-peak hours, David Tovar, a
spokesman, said in a telephone interview. For the past six
months, Wal-Mart has been reassigning greeters at the company&#8217;s
approximately 3,000 U.S. supercenters from the third shift,
which runs from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m., to other jobs, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founder Sam Walton added greeters in 1980 to make his giant
low-price stores friendly and welcoming. Cutting back, even
during the early morning hours, shows Wal-Mart is rethinking
longheld traditions to boost profit margins and guarantee low
prices, said David Strasser, an analyst with Janney Montgomery
Scott LLC in Philadelphia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s risky,&#8221; Strasser, who recommends buying Wal-Mart
shares, said in a phone interview. &#8220;Consumers have been going
to Wal-Mart for years, and greeters have become an expectation.
To a degree it defines Wal-Mart.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bruce Plummer, a greeter on the first shift at a Wal-Mart
in Fort Worth, Texas, said the company stopped scheduling third-
shift greeters at his store in recent weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s important that they have it,&#8221; Plummer said in an
interview. &#8220;Our job is to ask people if they have receipts. We
also make them feel welcome and safe.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dollar-Store Competition &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart has been minding its costs as U.S. sales growth
slows and dollar stores increase price competition, Strasser
said. Same-store sales at Wal-Mart&#8217;s namesake U.S. locations
declined for nine straight quarters before snapping the streak
with a 1.3 percent gain for the quarter ended in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protecting revenue and profit margins at Bentonville,
Arkansas-based Wal-Mart&#8217;s U.S. stores is important because they
accounted for 60 percent of total sales and 73 percent of
operating income for the nine months ended October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the former third-shift greeters are now stocking
shelves to make sure there is plenty of inventory for the busier
morning shopping hours, Tovar said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart management decided to make the change six months
ago, around the same time that the company hired consultant
Acosta Inc. to help make sure its stores had adequate inventory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wal-Mart DNA &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While greeters are an important part of Wal-Mart&#8217;s brand,
so is restraining costs and prices, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We realized that it wasn&#8217;t necessary to have people
greeting customers because it wasn&#8217;t peak shopping hours,&#8221;
Tovar said. &#8220;It was meant to operate stores as efficiently as
possible, which is also part of our DNA.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart&#8217;s competitive advantage is low pricing, so
constantly squeezing costs makes sense, said Matt Arnold, an
analyst with Edward Jones  Co. in Des Peres, Missouri. While
the company risks going too far by cutting staff, eliminating
third-shift greeters may have minimal impact, said Arnold, who
recommends buying the shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That time of night, shopping at Wal-Mart is serve-
yourself,&#8221; Arnold said in a telephone interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s
probably a minimal impact on customer service.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Debarati Roy" date="Jan 25, 2012  2:27 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-25/gold-proving-safest-commodity-as-goldman-forecasts-record-riskless-return.html"><headline>Gold Proves Safest as Goldman Forecasts Record: Riskless Return</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Gold provided the best returns of
all commodities in the past five years when adjusted for
volatility, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. says the rally will
continue as options traders signal no change in the metal&#8217;s
relatively low risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BLOOMBERG RISKLESS RETURN RANKING shows the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s GSCI Gold Total Return Index produced a 6.5 percent risk-
adjusted return in the five years ended yesterday, the highest
among 24 commodities tracked by SP, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Silver, the next-best performer, yielded a risk-adjusted
gain of 3.1 percent, while a total-return index for all raw
materials slipped 0.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullion, which has seen 11 years of gains as investors
sought a haven amid two bear markets in stocks and a sovereign
debt crisis, also posted the safest return in the past 12
months, even as it fell from a record high to a five-month low
in the second half of last year and gold investors led by John Paulson suffered losses. Goldman Sachs forecasts gold will reach
a record this year, and a gauge of future price swings is near a
five-month low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Economic problems increased globally, and gold emerged as
a safe-haven investment,&#8221; Walter &#8216;Bucky&#8217; Hellwig, who helps
manage $17 billion of assets at BBT Wealth Management in
Birmingham, Alabama. &#8220;Monetary easing by China and quantitative
easing in Europe and the U.S. will help it remain a store of
value.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk-adjusted return is calculated by dividing total
return by volatility, or the degree of daily price-swing
variation, giving a measure of income per unit of risk. The
returns are not annualized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longest Rally &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A higher volatility means the price of an asset can swing
dramatically in a short period of time, increasing the potential
for unexpected losses compared with a security whose price moves
at a steady rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold&#8217;s longest rally since at least 1920 in London has
attracted investors worldwide seeking protection from some of
the most violent market swings in stock markets on record. The
Dow Jones Industrial Average posted four consecutive days of
400-point swings last year, the longest streak since data began
in 1896. The SP 500&#8217;s average daily price move since its 2011
high in April was 1.8 percentage points, compared with an
average of 1.1 percentage points in the five years before Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed in September 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s Forecast &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risks that spurred market volatility last year will
keep swaying asset prices and the global economy, Nouriel
Roubini, the economist who predicted the 2008 financial crisis,
said in a talk at Bloomberg&#8217;s headquarters in New York on Jan.
19. Rising commodity prices, uncertainty in the Middle East, the
spreading European debt crisis, increased frequency of &#8220;extreme
weather events&#8221; and U.S. fiscal issues are &#8220;persistent&#8221;
problems, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s good news for havens such as gold. Goldman Sachs
said in a Jan. 13 report that futures will advance to $1,940 an
ounce in 12 months. Morgan Stanley forecasts the metal will
climb to a record average $2,175 in 2013, analysts Peter Richardson and Joel Crane said in a Jan. 17 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures for February delivery jumped 2.1 percent to settle
at $1,700.10 today on the Comex in New York. That&#8217;s the highest
closing price since Dec. 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traders anticipate that gold will gain at a steadier pace
again, after last year&#8217;s correction. The metal&#8217;s three-month
implied volatility, a gauge for future price swings, touched
19.04 yesterday, the lowest since early August. The most widely
held options contracts give holders the right buy at $2,000 by
June, data from the Comex exchange show. The ratio of puts per
call for the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest bullion ETF, is near
the lowest since October 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beating Gasoline &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People are still very under-invested in gold, and so
there is a huge scope of that increasing,&#8221; said Jochen Hitzfeld, the analyst at UniCredit SpA in Munich who was the
most accurate precious-metals forecaster tracked by Bloomberg in
the past two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold returned 1.1 percent in the 12 months through Jan. 24
when adjusted for price swings, compared with a 0.8 percent gain
in unleaded gasoline, the second-best performer. Stocks, as
measured by the SP 500, returned 0.2 percent over 12 months
risk-adjusted and 0.1 percent over five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold hasn&#8217;t been shielded completely from market swings
after investors accumulated more than 2,355 metric tons in
exchange-traded funds backed by bullion, an amount valued at
more than $126 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Holdings have more than doubled in the past four years and
climbed to an all-time high of 2,393 tons on Dec. 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Not Immune&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures, which rose to a record of $1,923.70 in September
on the Comex, slumped 11 percent the same month and retreated to
a five-month low of $1,523.90 on Dec. 29 as investors sold the
metal to cover losses in other markets. The risk-adjusted return
in the fourth quarter was minus 0.1 percent, while crude oil,
the best performer in the three months ended Dec. 31, returned
0.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Gold has become a mainstream alternative investment, so
rather than a store of value, it&#8217;s become a reflection of
flows,&#8221; said Michael Shaoul, chairman of New York-based
Marketfield Asset Management, which manages $1.3 billion. &#8220;It
is not immune to volatility.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson, the hedge-fund manager who suffered the worst year
of his career in 2011, lost 20 percent last month in his gold
fund, which can buy derivatives and other gold-related
securities, according to an investor update, a copy of which was
obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Tempt Fate&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most investors are sticking with the metal. David Einhorn&#8217;s
Greenlight Capital Inc. said in a Jan. 17 letter to investors
that the fund continues to hold gold and gold-mining equities
because of concern that global fiscal and monetary policies
&#8220;tempt fate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George Soros, 81, the billionaire founder of Soros Fund
Management LLC, increased his stake in SPDR Gold Trust, an
exchange-traded fund tracking the metal, to 48,350 shares as of
Sept. 30 from 42,800 and added options, according to Securities
and Exchange Commission filings. Soros, who called gold the
&#8220;ultimate asset bubble&#8221; in 2010, reinvested in gold shares
after selling 99 percent of his holding in the first quarter of
last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the start of this year, gold has been among the top
five commodities after adjusting for volatility, while zinc was
the best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central-Bank Buying &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central banks around the world added 157 tons to their
holdings in the six months through November, World Gold Council
data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China overtook India in the third quarter as the largest
gold-jewelry market, according to the World Gold Council. The
country&#8217;s consumption will continue to grow this year, according
to Albert Cheng, the Far East managing director at the council.
Mainland China imported a record 102.8 metric tons in November
from Hong Kong, trade data on Jan. 11 showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Everybody is conditioned to think of returns in a winner
fashion,&#8221; said Stanley Crouch, who helps oversee $2 billion as
chief investment officer at New York-based Aegis Capital Corp.
&#8220;During times of crisis, volatility really spooks people,
especially if it is in gold, as people look at it as a store of
value. However, I believe we have put in a bottom for gold so we
will see gold continue to climb.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Michael J. Moore" date="Jan 25, 2012 10:48 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-25/goldman-morgan-stanley-cut-by-jpmorgan-on-capital-requirements.html"><headline>Goldman, Morgan Stanley Cut by JPMorgan on Capital Requirements</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan
Stanley were cut by an analyst at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) on
concern that a U.S. regulatory proposal may make the banks&#8217;
capital requirements stricter than European rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulation draft released last month is an example that
U.S. investment banks &#8220;operate with ongoing un-coordinated
regulatory headwinds, reducing the competitiveness against
European investment-bank peers,&#8221; Kian Abouhossein wrote in a
note to investors today. He cut both New York-based firms, the
U.S. banks most reliant on trading, to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from
&#8220;overweight.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal addresses a mandate from the Dodd-Frank Act to
remove credit ratings from banking rules. Alternatives to credit
ratings could lead to increased capital requirements,
specifically from higher risk weightings for securitizations and
corporate debt exposures, Abouhossein wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulation draft would likely cut his estimate for
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Basel III Tier 1 common-equity ratio at the end
of this year to 8.5 percent from 9.7 percent, and Morgan
Stanley (MS)&#8217;s to 9.1 percent from 9.9 percent, Abouhossein wrote.
That would limit the banks&#8217; ability to repurchase shares, he
wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal was released in December by the Federal
Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency. It&#8217;s part of a U.S. effort to
implement global capital rules revised in 2009 by the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision, which coordinates global
regulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called market-risk rules, which cover assets on bank
trading books, were supposed to be in place by the end of 2011.
A European Union version went into effect Dec. 31. The Dodd-
Frank Act&#8217;s credit-ratings ban slowed the process in the U.S. as
regulators devised an alternative. Congress barred ratings after
firms including Moody&#8217;s Investor&#8217;s Service and Standard  Poor&#8217;s
gave their highest grades to mortgage-backed securities, which
allowed lenders to treat them as risk-free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed rules could be revised after a public comment
period that ends Feb. 3. A final version may be published a few
months later, according to regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Crayton Harrison" date="Jan 25, 2012  1:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-25/televisa-iusacell-await-word-after-antitrust-verdict-reached.html"><headline>Televisa, Iusacell Await Word After Antitrust Verdict Reached</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SAB, Mexico&#8217;s largest
broadcaster, is awaiting word on whether the nation&#8217;s antitrust
agency has approved its planned investment of $1.6 billion in
mobile-phone carrier Grupo Iusacell SA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Federal Competition Commission reached a decision
last night, it can&#8217;t announce the verdict until it has legally
notified the parties involved, the agency said yesterday in an
e-mailed statement. The agency has until Feb. 7 to complete that
task, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction would give Televisa entry into the market
for wireless service, escalating its rivalry with billionaire
Carlos Slim&#8217;s America Movil SAB (AMXL) in Mexico. The companies already
compete for Internet and home-phone customers. Televisa has
sought approval since April, when it announced the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the terms of the operation Televisa would get a 50
percent stake in Iusacell. Televisa agreed to pay an additional
$400 million to Iusacell shareholders if Ebitda reaches a
cumulative $3.47 billion between January 2011 and Dec. 31, 2015.
Iusacell had Ebitda of about $150 million in 2009, according to
Barclays Capital Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iusacell, owned by billionaire Ricardo Salinas, has sought
the investment to improve its coverage and services after
failing to lure customers from America Movil, which has 70
percent of Mexican subscribers. Without Televisa&#8217;s money,
Iusacell could disappear, Francisco Borrego, Salinas&#8217;s chief

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) is tackling crime in Las Vegas and Rochester, Minnesota,
where police departments have turned to high-tech analytics to
forecast crime &#8220;hot spots&#8221; and pursue leads quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software analytics is being used to help Rochester police
detect and predict crime patterns by creating a better database
with more reliable information. In Nevada&#8217;s biggest city, a
program called Coplink will organize data across four agency
databases, helping police make &#8220;non-obvious connections&#8221;
between people, places and things like mobile phones and cars,
Armonk, New York-based IBM said today in announcing the two
deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider already has
worked with police in cities such as New York, Los Angeles and
Memphis, Tennessee, to tackle crime more effectively by mining
data -- everything from arrest records and surveillance video to
unwise boasts on Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re using intelligent tools to help find things that
are hidden in the large amount of data that police already
have,&#8221; said Mark Cleverley, director of IBM&#8217;s public safety
initiatives. &#8220;We&#8217;re generating more and more quantities of
data, so you need these kinds of tools to be able to make sense
of that information.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of IBM&#8217;s policing technologies evolved from business
applications, including tools that predict what shoppers may be
tempted to buy based on their initial purchase, and identity
databases that casinos use to ensure they&#8217;re comping -- and
keeping an eye on -- the right and wrong gamblers, Cleverley
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has spent about $14 billion on 25 analytics
acquisitions in the past five years. Former Chief Executive
Officer Sam Palmisano made a priority of helping to build
&#8220;smarter&#8221; cities and businesses through software and programs
that analyze and project trends. New CEO Virginia &#8220;Ginni&#8221; Rometty, who succeeded Palmisano this month, inherits a five-
year plan that includes adding $20 billion in new revenue by
2015. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Naples Winter Wine Festival sold
out this year, thanks to Wolfgang Puck, Tony Mantuano and about
15 other chefs and a lot of wine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three-day Florida event, which raises money for
disadvantaged children, will serve high-end food and wine to 600
ticketholders who paid $8,500 to $20,000 per couple. One of the
top charity wine auctions in the U.S., it raised $12.1 million
last year and has brought in $94.6 million since it began in
2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Wolfgang Puck is a name that attracts a lot of
attention,&#8221; Robert Clifford, the event&#8217;s co-chairman and
founding partner of the Chicago-based Clifford Law Offices PC,
said by phone. &#8220;To have him throw in his time and talent for
this charity is something we&#8217;re so grateful for.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the three-day event starts, there will be a wine
tasting and lunch tomorrow (also sold out) honoring Prince
Robert of Luxembourg, the president and chief executive officer
of Domaine Clarence Dillon, parent company of Chateau Haut-Brion
and its adjoining property, Chateau La Mission Haut-Brion.
Attendees who paid $2,500 will sample wines from five of its
most acclaimed vintages: 1961, 1982, 1989, 1990 and 2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will host a Friday event that will
introduce some of the attendees to the children aided by the
event&#8217;s parent organization, the Naples Children  Education
Foundation, and nonprofits it supports. Also on Friday, Puck and
other chefs will prepare meals for groups of 40 in the homes of
the foundation&#8217;s trustees and supporters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Treasure Chest&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, wine collectors will compete for rare and
prized vintages and luxury travel experiences at an auction that
in recent years has raised an average of $8 million in five
hours, Clifford said. The highlights include prized bottles from
the Verite Vineyard in California; a Haut-Brion &#8220;Treasure
Chest&#8221; which includes a mix of reds, whites and older vintages;
and a two-week voyage for four aboard a luxury ship with a
private chef. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clifford said he hopes the event will raise the 12-year
total past the $100 million mark. (By comparison, the annual
Auction Napa Valley in California took 31 years to reach that
milestone.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mantuano of Chicago&#8217;s Spiaggia, a President Barack Obama
favorite and known for his masterful interpretations of classic
Italian dishes, is the festival&#8217;s chef de cuisine, an honor
bestowed on him for his service in five festivals. He will serve
caviar with burrata cheese and Wagyu steak with a porcini
mushroom salad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two forged diplomatic pouches
containing a total of 35 pounds (16 kilos) of cocaine were
delivered last week to the UN headquarters building in New York,
according to a UN official speaking on condition of anonymity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The packages, delivered to the mail room, were singled out
Jan. 16 by security staff during a scan, according to the
official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No recipient was identified on the shipment, which was sent
from Mexico City, and the badly forged UN logo on the parcels
was an effort to get the shipment across the border, the
official said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Two suspicious mail bags were intercepted by the Security
and Safety Service at United Nations headquarters in New York,&#8221;
according to a statement released by the UN spokesman&#8217;s office,
which declined to describe the contents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The United Nations nor anyone located in the United
Nations was the intended recipient of this delivery and the bags
were not UN bags, diplomatic or other,&#8221; according to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Browne, a spokesman for the New York Police
Department, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment on the delivery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A U.S. appeals court blocked Chevron
Corp. (CVX) from using a New York law to try to bar a group of
Ecuadorians from collecting on an $18 billion judgment in an
environmental damage lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court today reversed a lower-court order,
saying Chevron can&#8217;t use the law against the plaintiffs before
they try to collect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron will have its opportunity to challenge the
judgment&#8217;s enforcement under this act at such time, if any, as
judgment-creditors seek to enforce the judgment in New York,&#8221; a
three-judge panel of the Manhattan-based court said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan
issued a ruling that barred Ecuadorean residents in the Amazon
River Basin from enforcing an $18 billion judgment awarded by a
court in their country until a separate suit by Chevron against
the villagers and their lawyers is decided. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron believes this corrupt judgment will be
unenforceable in any country that adheres to the rule of law and
we will continue to defend Chevron&#8217;s interests against any
attempts to enforce the fraudulent judgment,&#8221; San Ramon,
California-based Chevron said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron was ordered Feb. 14 to pay as much as $18 billion
in compensatory and punitive damages for Texaco Inc.&#8217;s alleged
dumping of toxic drilling wastes in the Ecuadorian jungle from
1964 to about 1992. The ruling came in an 18-year-old lawsuit
decided by a judge in Lago Agrio, a provincial capital near the
Colombian border. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Grave Injustice&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A grave injustice against the Ecuadorians has been set
right by today&#8217;s 2nd Circuit ruling,&#8221; Karen Hinton, a
spokeswoman for the plaintiffs, said in a statement. &#8220;It
rebukes Chevron&#8217;s abusive legal tactics of the past two years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron says it cleaned up its portion of the oil fields
and was released from pollution claims against Texaco in an
agreement with the government of Ecuador. Chevron acquired
Texaco in 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Chevron Corp. v. Naranjo, 11-1150, U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission announced resolution

today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two men are jointly required to pay $57,481 in

illegal trades, according to the SEC. Spencer Mindlin is to pay
an additional $25,000 civil money penalty, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) was sued by
the Netherlands&#8217; biggest retirement fund, accusing the
investment bank of making false or misleading statements in
selling residential mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP (ADPZ) sued New York-based Goldman
Sachs in New York State Supreme Court today, saying that the
bank knew that originators of the loans underlying the
investments hadn&#8217;t followed underwriting standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman knew of, and facilitated, the wholesale and
systematic abandonment of underwriting guidelines by various
third-party originators faced with Goldman&#8217;s demands that as
many loans as possible be originated so that they could be
packaged and sold to investors like plaintiff,&#8221; lawyers for
Stichting said in the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stichting also sued Deutsche Bank AG and JPMorgan Chase 
Co. over sales of mortgage-backed securities in New York state
court last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stichting, the pension fund for Dutch public educational
and government workers, has more than
250 billion euros ($332.8 billion) in assets under management,
according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
biggest recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
and the crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the
market for the securities evaporated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Duvally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment on the lawsuit in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP v. Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., 650264/2012, New York State Supreme Court, New York
County (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Joe Carroll" date="Jan 27, 2012  5:16 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-27/chevron-posts-biggest-earnings-decline-in-two-years-correct-.html"><headline>Chevron Posts Biggest Profit Drop in Two Years on Refining</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. energy company, posted its biggest quarterly earnings
decline in two years after refining losses undercut gains from
record crude prices. The shares fell more than 3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s U.S. refineries lost an average $2.2 million
a day during the final three months of 2011 as crude-processing
margins shrank and maintenance work at a California plant curbed
fuel output, the company said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They were hit by a huge drop-off in refining margins at
the same time they had a very large maintenance project at a
California refinery,&#8221; Gianna Bern, president of Brookshire
Advisory  Research in Chicago, said today in a telephone
interview. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to see a lot more of this to come as
refining margins come under continued pressure all over the
globe.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer John Watson has been selling oil
refineries and filling stations in Europe and Africa to focus on
higher-profit crude production and natural-gas liquefaction
projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income declined to $5.1 billion, or $2.58 a share, from
$5.3 billion, or $2.64, a year earlier, San Ramon, California-
based Chevron said in its statement. Per-share profit was 32
cents below the average of five analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Production Decline &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron fell 2.5 percent to $103.96 at the close in New
York, after earlier falling to $103.12 for the biggest intraday
drop since Dec. 14. Oil and gas production from Chevron&#8217;s wells
declined 5.2 percent to the equivalent of 2.64 million barrels
of crude a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales rose 11 percent to $60 billion during the quarter.
For the full year, net income climbed 41 percent to a company
record of $26.9 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron added the equivalent of 1.67 billion barrels in
reserves last year, enough to replace 171 percent of the oil and
gas the company pumped last year, according to today&#8217;s
statement. That was the best reserves performance since 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company plans to drill exploratory wells this year in
shale formations in Poland, Canada and the Utica deposit in the
U.S. Northeast, Watson told analysts and investors during a
conference call today. Even as other international energy
companies have driven up the price of U.S. shale assets, Chevron
remains &#8220;very positive&#8221; on that facet of the business, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Brazil, Nigeria Problems &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s 2011 performance was marred by controversy over
oil seeps off the coast of Brazil and a rig fire in Nigeria that
killed two workers, Watson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron didn&#8217;t put its &#8220;best foot forward&#8221; in the days
immediately following the Brazilian seeps triggered by drilling
at the company&#8217;s Frade project, Watson said today. Since then,
the company has sought to improve communications with Brazilian
regulators incensed by the incident, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Nigeria, two rigs have been mobilized to drill a relief
well at the site of an offshore gas well that has been burning
since it erupted on Jan. 16, Watson said today. The size of the
flame has been reduced and an investigation is underway to
determine the cause, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Commodity Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent oil futures, the benchmark for two-thirds of the
world&#8217;s crude, climbed 25 percent to a record fourth-quarter
average of $109.02 a barrel. Chevron gets 74 percent of its oil
outside the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas futures traded in New York dropped 13 percent from a
year earlier to average $3.48 per million British thermal units,
the lowest fourth-quarter average since 2001. Intensive drilling
techniques that enabled explorers to tap shale formations helped
boost total U.S. gas production by 7.4 percent in 2011, swelling
supplies and depressing prices, according to Energy Department
figures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising labor and raw-material costs eroded some of
Chevron&#8217;s gains from higher crude prices during the fourth
quarter, Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones  Co. in
St. Louis, said today in an interview. Chevron&#8217;s oil and gas
business earned $23.62 per barrel of output, down from $25.94
during the July-to-October period, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), based in Irving, Texas, is the largest
U.S. energy company. Exxon Mobil will report its fourth-quarter
results Jan. 31. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SAB posted its
biggest weekly drop in almost three years as investors braced
for an antitrust ruling on the company&#8217;s plans to enter the
wireless business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa, the world&#8217;s largest Spanish-language broadcaster,
fell 9.1 percent over the past five days to 51.73 pesos for the
biggest weekly decline since March 2009. The shares closed at
their lowest level since Oct. 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico&#8217;s Federal Competition Commission voted 3-2 to block
Televisa&#8217;s planned $1.6 billion deal for a 50 percent stake in
mobile-phone provider Grupo Iusacell SA (CEL*), El Universal newspaper
reported Jan. 25, citing unidentified people. The agency said it
won&#8217;t officially disclose the ruling until the parties have been
legally notified, and Televisa has declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I see it as negative for the company,&#8221; said Jorge Lagunas, who oversees about $200 million as a money manager at
Mexico City-based Grupo Financiero Interacciones SA. &#8220;The
company needs to look for other vehicles to figure out what to
do to participate in quadruple-play more quickly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quadruple-play refers to packages of home-phone, Internet,
television and mobile services. Televisa already offers the
first three through its cable and satellite units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa had already agreed to spend $1.6 billion by the
end of last year to acquire debt in Iusacell that would be
convertible to shares when the deal was approved by the
antitrust agency. Televisa hasn&#8217;t disclosed whether it could get
its money back if the deal is rejected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lagunas sold shares this week and said he would start
buying again if the stock price dropped to 50 pesos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, won U.S. clearance to sell a new medicine for
advanced kidney cancer in patients who have failed prior
treatments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration approved the drug, Inlyta,
after concluding it helps prevent the cancer from progressing,
the agency said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug will provide a new treatment option for as many as
13,000 patients diagnosed with advanced kidney cancer in the
U.S. each year, said Subramanian Hariharan, the lead of New
York-based Pfizer&#8217;s global medical team for Inlyta. Sales of the
drug may reach $555 million in 2016, according to the average
estimate of three analysts compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re excited for patients,&#8221; Hariharan said today in an
interview. &#8220;Along with Sutent and Torisel, Pfizer now has three
drugs that will help physicians and patients with advanced
kidney cancer in the United States.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer declined less than 1 percent to $21.48 at the close
in New York. The shares have gained 16 percent in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inlyta, Sutent and Torisel are among seven drugs approved
by the FDA for metastatic or advanced kidney cancer since 2005,
Richard Pazdur, director of the FDA&#8217;s Office of Hematology and
Oncology Products, said in the statement. The others are Nexavar
from Bayer AG (BAYN) and Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ONXX), Novartis AG (NOVN)&#8217;s
Afinitor, Roche Holding AG (ROG)&#8217;s Avastin and GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)&#8217;s
Votrient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Potential Competitor &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tivozanib, a kidney-cancer drug from Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based Aveo Pharmaceuticals Inc. (AVEO) is in late-stage
clinical trials and may also compete with Inlyta if it gains FDA
approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inlyta, known chemically as axitinib, worked better than
Nexavar in a comparative study of 723 patients who had failed
one prior therapy. Those treated with Inlyta lived a median of
6.7 months before their tumors got worse, two months longer than
patients who received Nexavar, the FDA said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s drug also shrunk tumors in 19 percent of the trial
participants who received it, compared with 9 percent of
patients treated with Nexavar, Hariharan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inlyta blocks receptors in the body thought to play a role
in spreading tumors. Kidney cancer affects 296,000 people in the
U.S., according to the American Cancer Society. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Billionaire Len Blavatnik, who is
suing JPMorgan Chase  Co. over claims it lost 10 percent of the
$1 billion it managed for him, refused to extend the pre-trial
fact-gathering period as requested by a bank lawyer about to
have open-heart surgery, the lawyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bruce Birenboim, an attorney for JPMorgan, explained
Blavatnik&#8217;s refusal in a letter to a Manhattan judge yesterday.
Birenboim said Blavatnik wouldn&#8217;t extend the schedule two months
to June 29, a request Birenboim made because he will be
unavailable for six to eight weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have never in my 30 years of practice found an
adversary&#8217;s position to be so unprincipled and unprofessional,&#8221;
Birenboim, a partner at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton  Garrison
LLP, wrote to New York State Supreme Court Justice Melvin L. Schweitzer. He said Blavatnik and his lawyers &#8220;have chosen to
litigate this matter without regard&#8221; for &#8220;common civilities&#8221;
and &#8220;professional courtesies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blavatnik, 54, sued in 2009, claiming that New York-based
JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, put twice as much
money into risky mortgages as his investment guidelines allowed
while Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon was unloading such
securities from the bank&#8217;s books. Blavatnik says the bank lost
$98 million of his funds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jacques G. Maisonrouge, a French
native who became the first non-American on the board of
International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) after helping the company
expand globally, has died. He was 87. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He died at his home in Paris on Jan. 25, according to a
death notice in the New York Times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As head of IBM&#8217;s World Trade division, which managed
international expansion, Maisonrouge helped the company become
one of the first global corporations. Thomas J. Watson, IBM&#8217;s
chief executive officer from 1914 to 1956, adopted the slogan
&#8220;World Peace Through World Trade,&#8221; as a corporate mission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a company history, Maisonrouge recalled traveling in
segregated South Africa in the late 1970s, when black employees
at IBM&#8217;s Johannesburg plant lived in neighboring Soweto township
and were subject to a curfew. Maisonrouge said he won permission
to have the employees join him for dinner at a whites-only hotel
in Johannesburg. &#8220;It was beautiful,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We did things
that were progressive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maisonrouge began his 36-year career with IBM in 1948 and
became assistant to the sales manager of IBM France in 1954. By
1965, at 41, he was IBM&#8217;s top executive in Europe. &#8220;If I worked
for a European-owned company, I would not be as high as I am
now,&#8221; he told Time magazine that year. &#8220;I&#8217;m too young.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employees at Greenlight Capital Inc. (GLRE)
and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s Cazenove unit were fined in a second
wave of U.K. sanctions over Greenlight&#8217;s sale of Punch Taverns
Plc (PUB) shares in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexander Ten-Holter, the hedge fund&#8217;s former compliance
officer, was fined 130,000 pounds ($204,000) for failing to
&#8220;make reasonable enquiries&#8221; before selling the firm&#8217;s holding,
the Financial Services Authority said in a statement today.
Caspar Agnew, a Cazenove trader, was fined 65,000 pounds for
failing to identify and report a &#8220;suspicious order.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlight Capital and its chairman, David Einhorn, were
already fined 7.2 million pounds by the U.K.&#8217;s FSA, which
included the regulator&#8217;s second-largest fine for an individual.
Andrew Osborne, a former corporate broker at Bank of America
Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch, also faces a fine of 350,000 pounds in
the investigation, a person with knowledge of the matter said
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ten-Holter&#8217;s approach to compliance oversight was wholly
inadequate,&#8221; Tracey McDermott, the FSA&#8217;s acting director of
enforcement and financial crime, said in an e-mailed statement.
&#8220;Serious compliance failures of this nature can have a dramatic
effect on the orderliness and integrity of the markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Full Support &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlight said that Ten-Holter continues to have the hedge
fund&#8217;s full support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Alex is a valued member of the Greenlight team and our
trader in the U.K.,&#8221; Greenlight said in an e-mailed statement.
&#8220;We believe that the FSA&#8217;s action against him is unwarranted.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agnew didn&#8217;t &#8220;act with due skill, care and diligence,&#8221; in
failing to report the trade as suspicious, the FSA said. He
&#8220;thought that Greenlight was simply fortunate in the timing of
its transactions.&#8221; The regulator said that his &#8220;integrity is
not questioned in any way.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kate Haywood, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan in London,
declined to comment today. Agnew and Ten-Holter didn&#8217;t respond
to e-mail messages seeking comment. A number for Osborne
couldn&#8217;t be located and Bank of America declined to comment or
provide contact details for him yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Einhorn, Greenlight&#8217;s 43-year-old chairman, was told of
Punch Taverns&#8217;s plan to sell equity by a broker representing the
company, the FSA said in an e-mailed statement on Jan. 25. He
then sold more than 11 million Punch Tavern shares over the
following four days, avoiding losses of about 5.8 million pounds
for the fund, the regulator said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I didn&#8217;t believe in 2009, and I don&#8217;t believe now, that
there was anything wrong with our conduct,&#8221; Einhorn said after
the FSA fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlight, wholly owned by Einhorn, had around 31
employees in 2009, according to the FSA. The $7.8 billion
Greenlight Capital LP fund returned 2.9 percent last year and
has produced annualized returned of 20 percent since the fund
started in May 1996, according to a letter sent to investors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R. Allen Stanford, standing trial on
allegations he led a $7 billion investment fraud, appeared in an
October 2008 video shown to jurors in which he decried &#8220;damn
greed&#8221; on Wall Street as the financial crisis deepened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People are stupid, they&#8217;re greedy, they&#8217;re lazy, they
don&#8217;t stick to their core values,&#8221; he told a gathering of
Stanford Financial Group Co. executives in Miami. &#8220;We&#8217;re
different.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the video, shown yesterday in Houston federal court, the
financier told his audience that the company was &#8220;$5.5 billion
more liquid than it should have been.&#8221; Four months later, U.S.
regulators filed suit claiming his businesses were missing
billions of dollars in investor money. He was indicted in June
2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors accuse Stanford of skimming more than $1
billion in investor deposits from his Stanford International
Bank Ltd. to fund a lavish lifestyle and support real estate
developments and unrelated companies that included regional
airlines and newspapers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charged with mail fraud, wire fraud and obstructing a U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission probe, Stanford, 61, told
jurors earlier this week that he wasn&#8217;t guilty. He faces as long
as 20 years in prison if convicted on the most serious charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge David Hittner, who is overseeing
Stanford&#8217;s case, said the trial, which began Jan. 23, may last
six weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video was played as Jason Green, former president of
Stanford Group Co.&#8217;s private client group, testified against his
ex-boss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green told the jury of 10 men and five women, which
includes three alternates, about a monthly newsletter Stanford
drafted for his investors and sent to him for his input in
December 2008, the same month New York money manager Bernard
Madoff admitted to the biggest Ponzi scheme in U.S. history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. Stanford, 09-cr-342, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston). The SEC
case against Stanford is Securities and Exchange Commission v.
Stanford International Bank, 09-cv-298, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of Texas (Dallas). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New Suits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Morgan Stanley Sued Over $1.2 Billion in Mortgage Securities &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley was sued over about $1.2 billion worth of
residential mortgage-backed securities by Bayerische Landesbank
and Dexia (DEXB) SA in New York state court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bayerische Landesbank, based in Munich and the second-
biggest German state-owned lender, asserts claims on almost $486
million in residential mortgage-backed securities purchased in
22 offerings in 2006 and 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dexia asserts claims on more than $680 million worth of the
securities bought in 21 offerings in 2006 and 2007. Belgium and
France are dismantling Brussels-based Dexia, once the world&#8217;s
leading lender to municipalities, after the company could no
longer fund itself as the sovereign-debt crisis dried up short-
term financing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both banks say the loans underlying the securities were
riskier than promised and that Morgan Stanley &#8220;knew or
recklessly disregarded&#8221; that the loans didn&#8217;t conform to
underwriting standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Lake, a spokesman for New York-based Morgan Stanley (MS),
declined to comment on the lawsuits, which were both filed Jan.
25 in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, because the
company hadn&#8217;t received them yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Bayerische Landesbank, New York branch v.
Morgan Stanley, 650230/2012; and Dexia SA/NV v. Morgan Stanley,
650231/2012, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Can&#8217;t Collect Part of $40 Billion Spill Costs From Transocean &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc (BP) can&#8217;t collect from Transocean Ltd. (RIG) part of the $40
billion in cleanup costs and economic losses caused by the 2010
oil well blowout and Gulf of Mexico spill, a judge ruled,
sending Transocean shares higher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP (BP/) must indemnify Transocean for pollution-related economic
damage claims under its drilling contract, U.S. District Judge
Carl Barbier in New Orleans ruled yesterday. London-based BP (BP\)
sued Transocean in April to recover a share of its damages and
costs from the spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any awards for punitive damages against Transocean or civil
penalties under the U.S. Clean Water Act won&#8217;t have to be
covered by BP, the judge wrote in his 30-page decision. He
didn&#8217;t say whether Transocean will be liable for punitive
damages or Clean Water Act penalties. Transocean has already
accepted responsibility for equipment losses and paying personal
injury and death claims, citing contract provisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This confirms that BP is responsible for all economic
damages caused by the oil that leaked from its Macondo well, and
completely discredits BP&#8217;s ongoing attempts to evade both its
contractual and financial obligations,&#8221; Transocean said in an
e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision leaves Transocean at risk for Clean Water Act
penalties and possible punitive damages. The U.S. sued BP and
Transocean in December 2010, alleging violations of the Clean
Water Act, and seeking penalties for each barrel of oil spilled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Under the decision Transocean is, at a minimum,
financially responsible for any punitive damages, fines and
penalties flowing from its own conduct,&#8221; BP said in a
statement. &#8220;Transocean cannot avoid its responsibility for this
accident.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP argued that Transocean&#8217;s conduct voided the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The April 2010 Macondo well blowout and the explosion that
followed killed 11 workers and set off the worst offshore oil
spill in U.S. history. The sinking of Transocean&#8217;s Deepwater
Horizon drilling rig and spill led to hundreds of lawsuits
against BP and its partners and contractors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re Oil Spill by the Oil Rig Deepwater
Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010, MDL-2179, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Apple, Google Must Face Employee-Poaching Ban Antitrust Lawsuit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) and Apple Inc. (AAPL) were among seven technology
companies that must face a lawsuit claiming they violated
antitrust laws by entering into agreements not to recruit each
other&#8217;s employees, a federal judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Lucy H. Koh in San Jose, California,
said yesterday that even if she dismisses some claims, she will
give the plaintiffs a chance to amend their complaint and re-
file it. Intel Corp. (INTC), Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE), Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s
Pixar animation unit, Intuit Inc. (INTU) and Lucasfilm Ltd. are also
named as defendants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They still have an antitrust claim that&#8217;s going forward
so I don&#8217;t want to see any obstruction on discovery,&#8221; she told
lawyers during a hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is a private lawsuit brought on behalf of
employees that mirrors claims the companies settled with the
U.S. Justice Department in 2010 following a probe. The companies
agreed to refrain from placing &#8220;cold calls&#8221; to lure workers
from competitors, the government said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision yesterday requires the defendants to produce
documents describing the agreements and permits lawyers to take
depositions, Saveri said. &#8220;We get to see what really
happened,&#8221; he said, adding that damages in the case could
amount to hundreds of millions of dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google said in a statement that is has &#8220;always actively
and aggressively recruited top talent,&#8221; declining to comment
further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George Riley, a lawyer for Apple, and Robert Mittelstaedt,
an attorney for Adobe, declined to comment immediately after the
hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zenia Mucha, a Disney spokeswoman, wasn&#8217;t immediately
available for comment after regular business hours yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel spokeswoman Laura Anderson, Intuit spokeswoman Sandra
Corradetti, and a representative at Lucasfilm didn&#8217;t immediately
return calls seeking comment on Koh&#8217;s ruling after regular
business hours yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The San Jose case is In Re High-Tech Employee Antitrust
Litigation, 11-2509, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
California (San Jose). The previous case is United States v.
Adobe Systems, 10-cv-1629, U.S. District Court, District of
Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Virginia, Alberta Lead Suit Against Corzine Over MF Losses &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Virginia Retirement System and Canada&#8217;s Alberta
province will lead a group lawsuit against Jon Corzine seeking
compensation for losses from MF Global Holdings Ltd (MFGLQ).&#8217;s collapse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero in Manhattan combined 12
lawsuits against Corzine, putting Virginia and Alberta at the
head as their combined investment losses of $19 million give
them a larger stake in the suit than seven other applicants for
lead plaintiff, he said in a signed order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global executives led by Corzine, New Jersey&#8217;s former
governor, made &#8220;materially misleading&#8221; statements about
liquidity and financial controls, Joseph DeAngelis alleged in
the first of the 12 similar suits. He also named Henri
Steenkamp, the New York-based company&#8217;s chief financial officer,
and Bradley Abelow, its president. JPMorgan Chase  Co., MF
Global&#8217;s banker, should have noticed the &#8220;depletion&#8221; of
customer money, and should have investigated, commodity
customers said in a separate suit seeking unspecified
restitution and damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Levander, a lawyer for Corzine, hasn&#8217;t responded to
e-mails seeking comment on the suits and Mary Sedarat, a
JPMorgan spokeswoman, has declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main case is DeAngelis v. Corzine, 11-cv-7866, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mets Ruling Draws 34 Similar Suits by Madoff Trustee &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal judge&#8217;s ruling in a $1 billion lawsuit against
the New York Mets owners has drawn 34 suits to the judge&#8217;s door
that claim to be similar to the case brought by the liquidator
of Bernard L. Madoff&#8217;s firm against Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan threw out most
of trustee Irving Picard&#8217;s claims against the team owners and
refused to let Picard appeal his ruling before a March jury
trial on $386 million in remaining claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rakoff has accepted as related some of the 34 cases against
other defendants, while others await decisions, according to
court records. Two new suits were added to the list Jan. 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defendants in Picard&#8217;s bankruptcy court suits, including
JPMorgan Chase  Co., have asked district judges to decide
whether Picard, a New York lawyer, has the right to sue them,
and for how much. They say that Picard is straining the limits
of the law as he tries to grab back money for victims of
Madoff&#8217;s fraud -- and some of them have won initial victories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Madoff trustee calculated in October that people and
companies he sued in about 247 actions had sought an &#8220;escape
hatch&#8221; from bankruptcy court, intended by Congress to handle
such cases, he said. Judge shopping was &#8220;perverting&#8221; the law,
Picard said in the October filing. He is appealing district
court rulings in the JPMorgan and other bank cases that knocked
out more than $28 billion of his claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mets owners have said they will ask Rakoff next month
for judgment on all remaining counts of Picard&#8217;s complaint.
Picard said separately he wants a ruling before trial on one
remaining count. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard originally demanded $300 million in profit and $700
million in principal from Wilpon, Katz and a group of family
members and related entities, saying they turned a blind eye to
Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme. The partners denied the allegation. In
September, Rakoff dismissed all or part of nine of 11 claims in
Picard&#8217;s suit against Wilpon and Katz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. Katz, 11-cv-03605, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Chinese Vitamin C Makers Can Be Sued by Buyers as a Group &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North China Pharmaceutical Co. (600812) and three other Chinese
makers of vitamin C can be sued in the U.S. for alleged price-
fixing by buyers acting as a group, a federal judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Brian M. Cogan in Brooklyn, New York,
yesterday certified a class of vitamin C buyers. The buyers are
seeking triple damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Individual class members are unlikely to have sufficient
resources -- let alone fluency with federal antitrust law -- to
institute a lawsuit such as this,&#8221; Cogan wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defendants, including Aland (Jiangsu) Nutraceutical
Co., Northeast Pharmaceutical Co. and Weisheng Pharmaceutical
Co., captured more than 60 percent of the worldwide market for
vitamin C by 2001, Cogan said in a September ruling. China&#8217;s
share of vitamin C imports to the U.S. climbed to more than 80
percent in 2002 from 60 percent in 1997, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cogan appointed Ranis Co., a food company in Elizabeth, New
Jersey, to represent the group seeking damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge also certified a group of buyers asking the court
to force the Chinese companies to stop their alleged antitrust
violations. He appointed Animal Science Products Inc., a
Nacogdoches, Texas-based maker of animal-feed additives, to
represent that group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling &#8220;is important because Chinese companies selling
products in the U.S. are being treated like companies from
England and Switzerland and Japan and Korea,&#8221; William A.
Isaacson, a lawyer for the plaintiffs at Boies, Schiller 
Flexner LLP, said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North China&#8217;s unit in the case is Hebei Welcome
Pharmaceutical. Charles Critchlow, a lawyer for Hebei Welcome at
Baker  McKenzie LLP in New York, declined to comment on Cogan&#8217;s
ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Goldstein, a lawyer for Aland (Jiangsu) at Orrick,
Herrington  Sutcliffe LLP in New York; James Serota, a lawyer
for Northeast Pharmaceutical (000597) at Greenberg Traurig LLP in New
York; and Daniel Mason, a lawyer for Weisheng Pharmaceutical at
Zelle Hofmann Voelbel  Mason LLP in San Francisco, didn&#8217;t
immediately return calls for comment on the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Vitamin C Antitrust Litigation, 06-
md-1738, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York
(Brooklyn). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Perelman Trial Testimony Ends With Tale of Broken Friendship &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 2 1/2 days of testimony about contract clauses and e-
mails, jurors in Donald Drapkin&#8217;s lawsuit against Ronald
Perelman&#8217;s MacAndrews  Forbes Holdings Inc. heard a witness
recount how the $16 million breach-of-contract claim splintered
a once-close friendship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The testimony yesterday wasn&#8217;t about Perelman&#8217;s
relationship with Drapkin, a top dealmaker who worked for
Perelman at MacAndrews  Forbes for 20 years. Rather, Eric Rose,
who heads the firm&#8217;s life sciences business, testified that he
fell ill last year and that Drapkin, once a dear friend, ignored
him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think he&#8217;s been more than aware of the difficulties
I&#8217;ve had in the last six months,&#8221; said Rose, who walked into
court using two canes and wearing a cap to retain body heat.
&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t even picked up the phone and called me.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drapkin, the former vice chairman, is suing MacAndrews 
Forbes for $16 million that he says the firm failed to pay him
after he left in 2007. Lawyers for MacAndrews  Forbes called
Rose to the witness stand as their final witness yesterday to
bolster their claim that Drapkin breached a separation agreement
by trying to induce Rose to quit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rose testified about a dinner at Quality Meats in Manhattan
on May 14, 2007, three weeks after Drapkin left MacAndrews 
Forbes. Most of the dinner was about &#8220;everyday life stuff,&#8221;
said Rose, who met Drapkin on a rafting trip in the early 1990s.
Then the conversation switched to the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Drapkin told me that Mr. Perelman had little interest
in life science, and in light of that my continuation at
MacAndrews would be disastrous long-term for my future,&#8221; Rose
testified. &#8220;The implication of that was clear for me.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drapkin says he agreed to leave the firm in 2007 in return
for millions of dollars in severance and proceeds from the sale
of his stock. He has yet to be paid $16 million, money that
MacAndrews  Forbes says it withheld because Drapkin breached
the separation deal by withholding documents and trying to get
Rose to leave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Drapkin v. Mafco Consolidated Group, 09-
cv-1285, and MacAndrews  Forbes LLC v. Drapkin, 09-cv-4513,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Dresdner Banker Says Commerzbank Bonus Didn&#8217;t Match &#8216;Worth&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former manager at Commerzbank AG&#8217;s (CBK) Dresdner Bank unit
told a London court he was suing the German lender because it
hasn&#8217;t paid him the bonus his performance deserved -- $394,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desmond McNamara, who headed up risk management for
Dresdner&#8217;s capital-markets division, is one of 104 London-based
bankers who have sued claiming Commerzbank failed to honor a
bonus pledge Dresdner made before it was taken over in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m only claiming the amount my line manager determined
during the year my performance was worth,&#8221; McNamara said. While
he received salary and a guaranteed bonus worth around 400,000
pounds ($628,000) for 2008, Commerzbank didn&#8217;t pay a
discretionary bonus he was told was worth another $394,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commerzbank, Germany&#8217;s second-biggest lender, completed a
takeover of Dresdner in January 2009 then cut bonuses by 90
percent or more, according to court filings from the former
Dresdner bankers. Stefan Jentzsch, Dresdner&#8217;s former chief
executive officer, had in 2008 promised to set aside 400 million
euros ($524 million) for workers who stayed at the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commerzbank, which took an 18.2 billion-euro bailout from
Germany during the credit crunch, has been sued in London,
Germany and Singapore by workers who claim they weren&#8217;t paid
what they were owed after the buyout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier, Commerzbank lawyer Tom Linden set out the
Frankfurt-based lender&#8217;s case, saying the 400 million-euro
promise made by Jentzsch at a 2008 meeting &#8220;cannot have been
intended to be legally binding even if it genuinely represented
the intentions of the bank.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases include: Mr. Fahmi Anar  Others v. Dresdner
Kleinwort Limited, Commerzbank AG (CBK), High Court of Justice,
Queen&#8217;s Bench Division, HQ09X05230 and Richard Attrill  71
others v. Dresdner Kleinwort Limited, Commerzbank AG, HQ09X04007 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chevron Bid to Block Judgment Rejected by Appeals Court &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A U.S. appeals court blocked Chevron Corp. (CVX) from using a New
York law to try to bar a group of Ecuadoreans from collecting on
an $18 billion judgment in an environmental damage lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court yesterday reversed a lower-court order,
saying Chevron can&#8217;t use the law against the plaintiffs before
they try to collect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron will have its opportunity to challenge the
judgment&#8217;s enforcement under this act at such time, if any, as
judgment-creditors seek to enforce the judgment in New York,&#8221; a
three-judge panel of the Manhattan-based court said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan
issued a ruling that barred Ecuador residents in the Amazon
River Basin from enforcing an $18 billion judgment awarded by a
court in their country until a separate suit by Chevron against
the villagers and their lawyers is decided. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A grave injustice against the Ecuadorians has been set
right by today&#8217;s 2nd Circuit ruling,&#8221; Karen Hinton, a
spokeswoman for the plaintiffs, said in a statement. &#8220;It
rebukes Chevron&#8217;s abusive legal tactics of the past two years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron was ordered Feb. 14 to pay as much as $18 billion
in compensatory and punitive damages for Texaco Inc.&#8217;s alleged
dumping of toxic drilling wastes in the Ecuadorian jungle from
1964 to about 1992. The ruling came in an 18-year-old lawsuit
decided by a judge in Lago Agrio, a provincial capital near the
Colombian border. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron believes this corrupt judgment will be
unenforceable in any country that adheres to the rule of law and
we will continue to defend Chevron&#8217;s interests against any
attempts to enforce the fraudulent judgment,&#8221; San Ramon,
California-based Chevron said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron says it cleaned up its portion of the oil fields
and was released from pollution claims against Texaco in an
agreement with the government of Ecuador. Chevron acquired
Texaco in 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Chevron Corp. v. Naranjo, 11-1150, U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ranbaxy Violations Include Unsafe Drugs, U.S. Says in Settlement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. (RBXY) made &#8220;adulterated, potentially
unsafe&#8221; medicines that were illegal to sell, U.S. prosecutors
said in a proposed settlement with the Indian drugmaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among alleged violations, Ranbaxy failed to adequately
separate the production of penicillin and non-penicillin drugs
and failed to take adequate steps to prevent contamination of
sterile medicines, the U.S. Justice Department said in a 58-page
document filed in federal court in Maryland Jan. 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement stipulates proposed changes Ranbaxy, based
on the outskirts of New Delhi, must make to settle the three-
year-old dispute. The drugmaker set aside $500 million to
resolve all potential civil and criminal liability related to
the U.S. investigation, it said last month. The company didn&#8217;t
admit or deny the accusations detailed in the settlement, which
requires approval by a federal judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This action against Ranbaxy is groundbreaking in its
international reach -- it requires the company to make
fundamental changes to its plants in both the United States and
India,&#8221; Tony West, assistant attorney general for the Justice
Department&#8217;s Civil Division, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our commitment to ensuring that the drugs the American
people rely on are safe, effective and manufactured according to
the FDA&#8217;s standards extends beyond our borders,&#8221; West said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department in collaboration with the Food and Drug
Administration uncovered numerous problems with Ranbaxy&#8217;s drug
manufacturing and testing in India and at facilities owned by
its U.S. subsidiary, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defects led the FDA to block more than 30 generic drugs
made at the Indian drugmaker&#8217;s Paonta Sahib and Dewas plants,
the FDA said in September 2008, three months after Tokyo-based
Daiichi Sankyo Co. (4568) agreed to buy a controlling stake in Ranbaxy
for $4.6 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranbaxy consented to the proposed decree on Dec. 20 in an
agreement signed by company officials including co-defendants
Dale Adkisson, head of global quality; Managing Director Arun
Sawhney; and Venkatachalam Krishnan, the company&#8217;s regional
director for the Americas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Today&#8217;s announcement is the next step in the process of
finalizing our agreement with the FDA to resolve this legacy
issue,&#8221; Sawhney said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. &#8220;We
are pleased with the progress we have made in upgrading and
enhancing the quality of our business and manufacturing
processes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daiichi Sankyo declined to comment on the proposed
settlement until the court approves the filing, spokesman Masaya
Tamae said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd., 12-00250,
U.S. District Court, District of Maryland (Baltimore). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Johnson  Johnson Wins Jury Verdict Over Levaquin Warning &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson  Johnson can&#8217;t be held liable for the tendon
injuries to a 78-year-old man who said the company didn&#8217;t
properly warn of the risks of its antibiotic Levaquin (JNJ), a
Minnesota jury said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clifford Straka, who blew out two Achilles tendons after
taking the drug for pneumonia, sued JJ and its Ortho-McNeil
Pharmaceutical unit in 2008. Straka said his doctor wasn&#8217;t aware
when she prescribed the drug that Levaquin was linked to an
increased risk of tendon damage in elderly patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson  Johnson, based in New Brunswick, New Jersey, has
denied any failure to warn and contended that Straka needed
Levaquin to treat his pneumonia. The Minneapolis federal jury
yesterday found that JJ and its unit failed to provide
reasonably adequate warnings, while also ruling that this wasn&#8217;t
the cause of Straka&#8217;s injuries. The verdict is the companies&#8217;
third straight trial win. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are trying to understand how the jury arrived at the
verdict,&#8221; Ronald Goldser, Straka&#8217;s attorney, said in an
interview. &#8220;If the warning is inadequate, what is it the doctor
did wrong?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is &#8220;pleased with the verdict,&#8221; Foster said in
an e-mail yesterday. &#8220;When used according to the product
labeling, Levaquin has been proven to be a safe and effective
medication.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was the third federal case to go to trial in
Minnesota alleging the unit, now known as Janssen
Pharmaceuticals, downplayed the risks of the antibiotic to boost
sales. JJ lost the first, a jury verdict for $1.8 million in
2010, and won the second last year. The company also won the
first state case in October, when a New Jersey jury rejected the
claims of two plaintiffs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JJ is facing more than 3,700 claims involving Levaquin in
state and federal courts, Bill Foster, a company spokesman, said
in an e-mail. The 2010 trial loss has been appealed and 43 cases
have been dismissed, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Straka v. Johnson  Johnson, 08-05742, combined
for trial in In re Levaquin Products Liability Litigation, 08-
md-01943, U.S. District Court, District of Minnesota
(Minneapolis). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;On The Docket &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ex-UBS Municipal Derivatives Chief Faces July Criminal Trial &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Ghavami, former co-head of UBS AG&#8217;s (UBSN) municipal-
derivatives group, will go on trial July 9 along with two
colleagues, Gary Heinz and Michael Welty, in a municipal bond
bid-rigging case, a federal judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three, who have pleaded not guilty, are accused in a
six-count indictment of engaging in &#8220;complex fraud schemes and
conspiracies that subverted competition in the market for
municipal finance contracts and deprived municipal bond issuers
of the benefits of their investments,&#8221; according to court
documents. U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood in Manhattan set the
trial date yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is one of three brought by the U.S. Justice
Department&#8217;s antitrust unit in connection with a nationwide bid-
rigging probe of contracts used by states and local governments
to invest municipal-bond proceeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conspiracy included more than 200 deals involving state
agencies, local governments and non-profits across the country,
according to documents filed in federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of evidence collected in the case is massive,
Charles Stillman, a lawyer for Ghavami, said in court. The U.S.
has provided more than 600,000 audiotapes and hundreds of
millions of documents, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unidentified municipality hired Ghavami&#8217;s firm to handle
the bidding for the investment of bond proceeds, government
prosecutors allege. Ghavami preselected the winning bidder in
exchange for a kickback to his employer, whom the government
didn&#8217;t identify, in a conspiracy that began in October 2001 and
ran until February 2002, according to the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stillman, Jonathan Halpern, a lawyer for Heinz, and Gregory
Poe, a lawyer for Welty, all declined to comment after court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Ghavami, 10-cr-1217, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.K. Prosecutor&#8217;s Fraud Chief Joins Jones Day as Departures Rise &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glyn Powell, a senior attorney at the U.K. Serious Fraud
Office, left the agency to join law firm Jones Day, adding to
the number of departures under the current director. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Powell, the former head of fraud and assurance at the SFO,
joined the U.S. firm this week after eight years at the agency.
He oversaw investigations of the U.K. operations of Bernard
Madoff, who is serving a 150-year prison sentence in the U.S.
for operating the largest Ponzi scheme in history, and Asil
Nadir, the former Polly Peck International Plc chief executive
officer who went on trial this week in London accused of
stealing 150 million pounds ($235 million). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Glyn&#8217;s criminal experience is a perfect adjunct to the
civil team here,&#8221; said Craig Shuttleworth, the head of
litigation in London at Jones Day, a Washington-based firm that
according to its website has clients including Bank of America
Corp., Deutsche Bank AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Powell is being replaced on an interim basis at the SFO by
case managers Jane de Lozey and Claire Whitaker until a new
director takes over in April, David Jones, an SFO spokesman,
said. Richard Alderman, the director since 2008, will be
replaced by David Green, a barrister who was formerly the
director of the Crown Prosecution Service&#8217;s Fraud Group. &lt;/p&gt;

Stanford" date="Jan 27, 2012 12:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-27/pepsico-may-boost-marketing-budget-to-take-on-a-surging-coca-cola-retail.html"><headline>PepsiCo May Boost Marketing Budget to Take On Coca-Cola: Retail</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) Chief Executive Officer
Indra Nooyi has taken over a coconut-water company, acquired a
dairy in Russia and spent millions on a philanthropic marketing
campaign. Her next big investment has a more familiar name:
Pepsi-Cola. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest snack-food maker may boost the
advertising and marketing budget for its namesake cola and other
drinks by as much as $600 million, or 50 percent, to $1.7
billion when it announces the results of a yearlong business
review Feb. 9, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nooyi is seeking to take back market share from Coca-Cola
Co. (KO) and regain the confidence of investors who have questioned
whether she has focused too much on healthier products. Some
investors and analysts have also recommended splitting the
company. PepsiCo&#8217;s shares have risen about 2 percent during her
five-year tenure while Coke has gained more than 50 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;PepsiCo overall needs to step up investments behind their
brands to reinvigorate them,&#8221; Bonnie Herzog, a New York-based
analyst at Wells Fargo  Co., said in a telephone interview.
&#8220;If you go back 10 years, they have definitely been under-
investing relative to Coke.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nooyi took over as Purchase, New York-based PepsiCo&#8217;s CEO
in October 2006 and sped up the company&#8217;s move into healthier
snacks and drinks. She set a goal of tripling sales of what the
company calls &#8220;nutrition products,&#8221; including Gatorade,
Tropicana and Quaker, to $30 billion by the end of the decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, Nooyi, 56, has focused resources on
acquisitions, including juice producers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pepsi Neglected &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Pepsi-Cola advertised less on television and
pulled back on direct product pitches; the company&#8217;s North
American beverages unit didn&#8217;t run Super Bowl ads for its Pepsi
brand drinks in 2010, the first such absence in 23 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company spent about $100 million on its &#8220;Pepsi
Refresh&#8221; campaign -- with a heavy digital thrust -- supporting
good works proposed by customers, which did little to improve
share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A good amount of the weakness stems from the management&#8217;s
increased focus on its better-for-you portfolio,&#8221; Ann Gurkin, a
Richmond, Virginia-based analyst with Davenport  Co., said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;They took support and focus away from
their core beverages -- Pepsi-Cola, Diet Pepsi -- and spent more
time and more effort enhancing juices, waters, sports drinks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spend More &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PepsiCo as a whole should spend $579 million more this year
than in 2011 to market its products, with most of that going to
beverages in North America, estimated Ali Dibadj, a New York-
based analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. Herzog projected
between $500 million and $600 million more for beverages
overall. Mark Swartzberg, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus  Co.
in New York, estimated PepsiCo will spend an additional $200
million to advertise beverages in the Americas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North American beverages account for about a third of
PepsiCo&#8217;s global sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola has invested more than PepsiCo as a percentage of
its net sales for a decade, Herzog said. The gap widened in 2004
and averaged 5.1 percentage points through 2010, she said.
PepsiCo&#8217;s advertising spending declined to 4 percent of revenue
as of 2010 from 6 percent in 2004, according to Kaumil
Gajrawala, a New York-based analyst for UBS AG. That excluded
the impact of bottler acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s too low, and historically there&#8217;s been a clear link
between advertising spend and sales,&#8221; said Kevin Rendino,
managing director for Blackrock Basic Value Fund Inc. in
Plainsboro, New Jersey. &#8220;Nooyi may have taken her eye off the
ball on the North American beverage side.&#8221; Rendino manages
about 850,000 PepsiCo shares as part of $11.5 billion in assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lost Share &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PepsiCo lost share in the U.S. carbonated beverage market
to Atlanta-based Coca-Cola from 2008 through 2010, according to
Beverage Digest, an industry newsletter. In 2010, Diet Coke -- a
regular advertiser on programs including the Academy Awards --
overtook full-calorie Pepsi-Cola to become the second-best-
selling soft drink in the U.S. behind Coca-Cola. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nooyi started fighting back last year, boosting ad spending
for North American beverages by 30 percent and focusing on soft
drinks including Pepsi Max. The company loaded airwaves with a
new Pepsi-Cola campaign that featured Santa Claus, a regular in
Coca-Cola&#8217;s commercials, shunning the brand for a Pepsi-Cola
while on vacation at a tiki bar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;X Factor&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nooyi also signed a $60 million sponsorship deal with Simon Cowell&#8217;s &#8217;&#8217;X Factor,&#8217;&#8217; an answer to Coca-Cola&#8217;s decade-long
sponsorship of the hit show American Idol. PepsiCo also will
return to the Super Bowl next month with soft drink ads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spending hasn&#8217;t worked yet. PepsiCo&#8217;s share of dollar
sales at groceries, drug stores, convenience stores and mass
merchandisers, excluding Wal-Mart Stores Inc., for soft drinks
carrying a Pepsi trademark declined by half a percentage point
last year to 18 percent, according to data from SymphonyIRI
Group, a Chicago-based researcher. Trademark Coca-Cola grew 0.3
percentage points to 28.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PepsiCo&#8217;s struggles have led analysts including Dibadj to
suggest that the company&#8217;s beverage and snacks businesses would
be worth more separate than together. That would follow the
example of Kraft Foods Inc., which is splitting in two to help
its snack business push products into emerging markets while the
slower-growing, higher-margin grocery company returns cash to
shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dismissed Recommendations &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, Nooyi has dismissed such recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;PepsiCo&#8217;s value is maximized as one company,&#8221; she said
during an October conference call. &#8220;It was created as an
integrated stack and beverage business and its success is tied
to this combination.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help pay for a boost in marketing and advertising
spending, Nooyi may have to cut costs elsewhere, said Dave
Novosel, a food and beverage analyst at Gimme Credit in New
York. PepsiCo may fire several thousand employees this year, a
person familiar with the plans said earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rendino, who is looking for as many as 5,000 job cuts and
$500 million or so in increased advertising, said he bought
PepsiCo for the first time recently because of its depressed
value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think there&#8217;s change taking place,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Julie Bykowicz" date="Jan 27, 2012 12:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-27/gingrich-jab-at-goldman-sachs-belies-pro-bank-policy-proposals.html"><headline>Gingrich Jab at Goldman Sachs Belies Pro-Bank Policy Proposals</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Newt Gingrich took aim at Wall
Street and by extension Republican presidential opponent Mitt Romney yesterday as the former U.S. House speaker said he isn&#8217;t
running for president to &#8220;represent Goldman Sachs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the investment firm Gingrich derided and the banking
industry as a whole stand to gain from his proposals to
eliminate the capital gains tax and repeal two financial-sector
measures, four analysts said in separate phone interviews. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gingrich&#8217;s tax package, which also calls for a reduction of
the personal income and corporate tax rates, would be beneficial
to many on Wall Street, including those at Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., an investment banking firm based in New York, the analysts
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is negative political rhetoric that&#8217;s not based on
anything, either his own history or his proposed policies,&#8221;
said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economic policy adviser to
Republican presidential candidate John McCain in 2008 who is 
unaffiliated this year. &#8220;He is proposing a flat, consumption-
style tax, which gives incentives for people to use the 
financial system.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gingrich&#8217;s comments yesterday are &#8220;inconsistent with what
he&#8217;s proposing,&#8221; said Holtz-Eakin, president of the American
Action Forum, an anti-tax organization based in Washington.
&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to defend on the logic.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gingrich Proposals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In campaign speeches, Gingrich has promised voters that on
his first day as president, he&#8217;d repeal, in addition to Obama&#8217;s
health-care legislation, the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act to monitor
corporate auditing and the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act of Wall Street
regulations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He often highlights his proposal on the capital gains tax
rate, which is scheduled to rise to 20 percent from 15 percent
by 2013. Gingrich would eliminate it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Balanced budgets, streamlined government and the biggest
capital gains tax cut in history led to unemployment falling to
under 4 percent by 2000,&#8221; Gingrich, who served as House speaker
for four years until resigning in 1999, said as he released his
economic plan Sept. 29 at a town hall meeting in Des Moines,
Iowa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dodd-Frank Act, passed in the aftermath of the 2008
financial crisis, authorized hundreds of new regulations to curb
misconduct and excessive risk-taking by Wall Street financial
firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dodd-Frank Act &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It includes new rules restricting the kinds of trades banks
can make with their own money, increasing supervision and
oversight by federal regulators, and imposing new requirements
to protect consumers from unfair or complicated products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new law requires most derivatives to be traded on
exchanges, gives shareholders a say in how executives are paid,
and limits the amount merchants pay for debit-card transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which Congress passed with an
overwhelming majority in the wake of the collapse of Enron
Corp (ENRNQ)., formed a new watchdog to oversee U.S. auditing and
required managers to sign off on financial reports and internal
controls at their public companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If these laws were removed, you would see, over time, an
increase in profitability, an increase in hiring to work for
financial firms, an increase in economic activity,&#8221; said Gerard Cassidy, managing director of bank equity research RBC Capital
Markets LLC. &#8220;It would enable financial companies to become
more profitable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Not Realistic&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many in the financial industry &#8220;might like that rhetoric,
but there&#8217;s a level of skepticism of what he&#8217;d be able to
accomplish as president,&#8221; said Brian Gardner, senior vice
president of Washington research for Keefe Bruyette  Woods
Inc.. He said it&#8217;s &#8220;not realistic&#8221; to eliminate the capital
gains tax and repeal Dodd-Frank and Sarbanes-Oxley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gingrich pivoted to a different tone yesterday. He and
Romney are locked in a tight battle to win the Jan. 31 Florida
primary, registering in a tie in recent polls that put them well
ahead of Texas Representative Ron Paul and former Pennsylvania
Senator Rick Santorum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re not going to beat Barack Obama with someone who
owns Swiss bank accounts, Cayman Island accounts,&#8221; Gingrich
said during a stop yesterday in Mount Dora, Florida. &#8220;I am
running for president to represent you, not to represent the
Washington establishment, not to represent Goldman Sachs. (GS)&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gingrich again referred to New York-based Goldman Sachs
later yesterday in a meeting with reporters. He said Romney, who
released his 2010 tax returns and 2011 estimate on Jan. 24, had
personal holdings in &#8220;a part of Goldman Sachs that was
explicitly foreclosing on Floridians.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mouse or Elephant &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a debate in Jacksonville, Florida last night, Romney
pointed out that Gingrich also has invested in mutual funds that
had Wall Street and housing holdings. Gingrich, who reported
$3.1 million in 2010 gross income, tried to deflect that by
saying it was like comparing &#8220;a tiny mouse with an elephant.&#8221;
Romney&#8217;s tax returns showed his gross income of $21.6 million in
2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrea Saul, a Romney spokeswoman, said yesterday it&#8217;s
&#8220;puzzling to see Speaker Gingrich and his supporters continue
their attacks on free enterprise. Unlike President Obama and
Speaker Gingrich, Mitt Romney spent his career in business and
knows what it will take to turn around our nation&#8217;s bad
economy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contributions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217; employees and their families provided more
contributions to Romney than any other single employer through
Sept. 30, the most recent campaign finance information
available, according to the Center for Responsive Politics,
based in Washington. The contributions totaled $367,200,
according to the center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romney&#8217;s campaign collected $3.6 million from the financial
industry, according to the center. The former Massachusetts
governor, whose assets are valued at as much as $250 million,
was a co-founder of Bain Capital LLC, a Boston private-equity
firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New campaign finance reports are due out Jan. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street, generally speaking, has a &#8220;comfort level&#8221;
with Romney, Gardner said &#8220;He&#8217;s one of them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Gardner said, &#8220;there is lack of comfort with
Gingrich,&#8221; dating back to his years in the House. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
think he was ever comfortable with the New York financial crowd.
There was no real, major move on his part to reach out to the
investment and commercial banking communities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many in the financial industry have determined Gingrich is
&#8220;unelectable and volatile,&#8221; Gardner said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seeking Balance &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business leaders are concerned with the country&#8217;s financial
integrity and bringing taxes and spending into alignment more so
than their individual tax rates, said Clinton Stretch, managing
principal of tax policy at Deloitte Tax LLP in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They want a candidate whose plan makes sense and who can
get it done,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gingrich&#8217;s tax policies &#8220;aren&#8217;t so much born of Wall
Street as they are aimed at Main Street,&#8221; Stretch said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gingrich and Romney would both retain some form of special
treatment for earnings tied to investments. Capital gains and
dividends are taxed at 15 percent compared to rates on wages,
which are as high as 35 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romney would continue the 15 percent rate on dividends and
capital gains and exempt anyone with adjusted gross income of
less than $200,000 from paying the tax at all. Gingrich would
eliminate the tax for all income brackets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than half of Romney&#8217;s 2010 income of $21.6 million was
tied to capital gains or dividends, which helped lower his tax
rate to 13.9 percent. Romney has been criticized for paying a
lower rate than middle-class taxpayers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Ginsberg, national counsel for Romney&#8217;s campaign, said
Jan. 24 that the Bain founder&#8217;s tax rate would have been even
lower if Gingrich&#8217;s proposal were in effect because it doesn&#8217;t
tax capital gains at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management Ltd.
relocated its Korean unit&#8217;s stock-trading desk to the Asia-
Pacific headquarters in Singapore late last year in a bid to cut
costs and improve efficiency, the Maeil Business Newspaper
reported, citing financial industry officials that it didn&#8217;t
identify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg calls to Seoul-based Christopher Jun, a Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) spokesman, were shifted to an answering machine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Rita Nazareth" date="Jan 30, 2012  5:05 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-30/u-s-stock-futures-decline-before-eu-summit-exxon-mobil-falls-in-germany.html"><headline>U.S. Stocks Decline Amid Concern About Greek Debt Negotiations</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks fell, sending the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index lower for a third day, as European
leaders sparred with Greece over a second rescue program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities pared declines as some of the biggest technology
companies rallied. Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) added at least
1.2 percent. Bank of America Corp. (BAC) fell 3 percent after Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. cut its recommendation. Halliburton Co. (HAL) and
Chesapeake Energy Corp. dropped more than 1.1 percent as oil
slumped. Gannett Co. (GCI), the owner of 82 newspapers including USA
Today, tumbled 6.9 percent as its profit plunged 33 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 decreased 0.3 percent to 1,313.01 at 4 p.m. New
York time. The benchmark index for American equities trimmed a
decline of as much as 1.2 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average retreated 6.74 points, or 0.1 percent, to 12,653.72. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The low hanging fruit has been picked and now it&#8217;s a more
difficult slog to get substantive changes in Europe,&#8221; said
Kevin Caron, a market strategist in Florham Park, New Jersey, at
Stifel Nicolaus  Co, which has more than $107 billion in client
assets. &#8220;There are near term doubts over the willingness of
Greece and perhaps other countries to accept fiscal reforms.
Anything that could interrupt further progress in the euro area
could be met with an opportunity for traders to sell.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s decline follows a four-week rally in the SP 500,
which was driven by the Federal Reserve&#8217;s plans to keep interest
rates low through at least late 2014 and better-than-estimated
earnings. Of the 171 SP 500 companies that reported results
since Jan. 9, 113 posted per-share earnings that beat
projections, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;National Dignity&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos rejected reports
of plans to appoint a European Union commissioner to oversee the
nation&#8217;s budget, citing &#8220;national dignity.&#8221; French President
Nicolas Sarkozysaid Greek debt-swap talks with private
bondholders are &#8220;going in the right direction&#8221; and the issue
should be settled in the next few days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The question isn&#8217;t whether or not Europe goes into a
recession, but how deep that recession is going to be,&#8221; Tom Wirth, who helps manage $1.5 billion as senior investment
officer for Chemung Canal Trust Co., in Elmira, New York, said
in a telephone interview. &#8220;Greece as it stands currently is
untenable. The market is getting comfortable with some sort of
Greek default, whether it&#8217;s orderly or disorderly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial shares had the biggest decline in the SP 500
among 10 industries, falling 1 percent as a group. Bank of
America dropped 3 percent to $7.07 after Goldman Sachs cut its
recommendation for the shares to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;buy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Energy Stocks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A measure of energy shares in the SP 500 retreated 0.4
percent. Halliburton slumped 1.2 percent to $36.67. Chesapeake
decreased 1.6 percent to $21.69. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nabors Industries Ltd. (NBR) gained 3.5 percent, the most in the
SP 500, to $18.56. Traders in the options market are betting
the world&#8217;s largest land-drilling contractor may be a takeover
candidate after the departure of its 81-year-old chief executive
officer. In the past two weeks, calls priced 10 percent above
Nabors&#8217; stock rose the most in 18 months versus puts on one-
month contracts, signaling traders are anticipating an
acquisition, said JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gannett tumbled 6.9 percent to $14.17. Revenue from the
publishing division, the largest unit, declined 5.3 percent as
advertising and circulation fell. The newspaper industry overall
has continued to lose ad business to Internet companies such as
Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Staples Inc. (SPLS) declined 4.9 percent to $15.23. The world&#8217;s
largest office products company was cut to &#8220;sell&#8221; from
&#8220;neutral&#8221; by Goldman Sachs, which cited a &#8220;tough&#8221; outlook
for the global printing segment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apple Rallies &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measures of telephone and technology companies in the SP
500 rallied. Apple added 1.3 percent to $453.01. Microsoft
gained 1.3 percent to $29.61. Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) rose
1.1 percent to $37.61. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pep Boys -- Manny, Moe  Jack surged 24 percent to $14.93
after agreeing to go private in an acquisition by Gores Group
LLC valued at about $791 million. The cash offer of $15 a share
is 24 percent higher than Pep Boys&#8217; closing price on Jan. 27,
the companies said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US Airways Group Inc. (LCC) rallied 4.2 percent to $8.52. Delta
Air Lines Inc. (DAL) is studying a bid as North American carriers
assess possible combinations after the bankruptcy of American
Airlines parent AMR Corp., people familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valuations (SPX) for U.S. equities have been stuck below the
five-decade average for the longest period since Richard Nixon&#8217;s
presidency, a sign investors don&#8217;t trust earnings even after a
three-year bull market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Record Profits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts estimate profits in the SP 500 will reach a
record $104.78 this year after increasing 125 percent since the
end of 2009, the fastest expansion in a quarter century,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. American companies are
boosting income so much that even after stocks doubled, the SP
500 hasn&#8217;t traded above its 16.4 mean ratio for 446 days, the
longest stretch since the 13 years beginning in 1973. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Battered by the 14 percent decline in the SP 500 since
2000, the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression and
the flash crash 21 months ago, investors are staying away from
stocks, even after record profits, 10 quarters of U.S. economic
growth and promises by the Federal Reserve to keep interest
rates near zero through 2014. Of the $37 trillion erased from
global equities in the credit crisis, $24 trillion has been
restored. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;After two significant bear markets, the flash crash and
the lost decade, many have simply said, &#8216;No mas,&#8217;&#8221; Howard Ward,
who helps oversee $35 billion at Gamco Investors Inc. in Rye,
New York, said in an e-mail on Jan. 24. &#8220;Of course, bull
markets have a history of climbing a wall of worry. And it is
happening again.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Yuji Okada and Jacob Adelman" date="Jan 30, 2012  4:25 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-30/tonengeneral-to-buy-exxon-s-japanese-unit-for-3-9-billion-3-.html"><headline>TonenGeneral to Buy Exxon&#8217;s Japanese Unit for $3.9 Billion</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;TonenGeneral Sekiyu KK (5012) agreed to buy
partner Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s Japanese business in a $3.9 billion
deal that may force the oil refiner to seek new alliances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TonenGeneral will acquire 99 percent of Exxon Mobil Yugen
Kaisha, which produces and sells fuels, for 302 billion yen
($3.9 billion) using cash and bank loans, the Tokyo-based
company said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refiners in Japan are grappling with rising operating costs
after a 2010 order from the government to upgrade their oldest
plants to extract more fuel from crude. While Japan&#8217;s
consumption is declining due to a shrinking population and
greater use of hybrid and electric autos, the transaction also
reflects Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson&#8217;s
strategy of focusing on oil exploration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;TonenGeneral will struggle to recover their acquisition
costs unless they find a strategic partner,&#8221; said Osamu Fujisawa, an independent energy economist in Tokyo. &#8220;There are
no Japanese refiners that can partner with Tonen. So, it should
be someone from the Middle East.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia&#8217;s state oil company, the source of almost 31
percent of Japan&#8217;s crude imports during the first nine months of
2011, owns a 15 percent stake in domestic refiner Showa Shell
Sekiyu KK. (5002) The Abu Dhabi government owns a 21 percent stake in
Japanese refiner Cosmo Oil Co. (5007) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TonenGeneral Managing Director Jun Muto said at a briefing
in Tokyo today the company isn&#8217;t planning to sell a stake in the
revamped company. &#8220;We don&#8217;t have any plan to cooperate with a
company in the Middle East,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shares Fall &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TonenGeneral fell 2 percent to 733 yen at the close in
Tokyo. Exxon dropped 0.4 percent to $85.49 at the close in New
York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal, which Exxon called a &#8220;restructuring&#8221; of its
Japan business into a single asset, doesn&#8217;t involve the U.S.
company&#8217;s liquefied natural gas marketing and sales or its
specialty chemicals operations in the country. Exxon will
continue to assist TonenGeneral with crude oil and products
acquisition, both companies said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TonenGeneral will be left with 200 billion yen to 300
billion yen in net debt after the transaction, which is expected
to close in June, Muto said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company had 100 billion yen in cash at the end of 2011,
according to a presentation on its website, and its market value
was $5.5 billion as of Jan. 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stake Reduced &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Exxon, the world&#8217;s largest energy company, the
transaction is the biggest divestiture since the 1999 deal with
Mobil Corp. that created the company. Exxon will see its stake
in TonenGeneral decline to 22 percent from 50 percent and the
Japanese refiner will retain exclusive rights to use its brands,
according to statements by the two companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Reducing exposure to refining makes sense in places like
Japan, where demand isn&#8217;t growing,&#8221; said Brian Youngberg, an
analyst at Edward Jones  Co. in St. Louis, who has a &#8220;hold&#8221;
rating on Exxon Mobil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In more mature economies like Japan, the U.S. and Europe,
you are seeing demand for gasoline declining,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Most
companies are at least reviewing their position in Japan.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s fuel market changed in 2010 with a government
directive to promote increased gasoline and gasoil production
from residue, a low-grade byproduct of the refining process.
Residue-processing facilities such as coker units cost about 100
billion yen to build, according to Credit Suisse Group AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government order didn&#8217;t play a role in Exxon&#8217;s planning
and TonenGeneral has no immediate plans to reduce production,
Muto said. &#8220;The appropriate level of capacity is something
we&#8217;re going to have to study going forward,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TonenGeneral also maintained its dividend forecast of 38
yen per share for 2011 and said that it intends to repeat it
this year. In November, the company forecast full-year net
income of 133 billion yen. It hasn&#8217;t yet announced earnings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CVC Capital Partners Ltd., the
buyout firm that owns Formula One, is in exclusive talks to buy
Ahlsell AB, a Swedish construction products supplier, four
people with knowledge of the talks said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm has been granted four weeks by Ahlsell&#8217;s owners,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Cinven Ltd., to complete the
financing of its bid, said one of the people, who declined to be
identified because the talks are private. A sale may raise about
1.5 billion pounds ($2.3 billion), the people said. Reuters
reported the talks earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CVC competed with the private equity firms Nordic Capital
Svenska AB, Bain Capital LLC and BC Partners Ltd. for the asset,
people with knowledge of the process said earlier this month.
Cinven and Goldman Sachs bought Stockholm-based Ahlsell in 2006
for 1.2 billion euros ($1.6 billion), according to Cinven&#8217;s
website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials at Goldman Sachs, Cinven and CVC declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahlsell, which distributes heating and plumbing products
and other construction equipment in the Nordic region, Russia
and Eastern Europe, had revenue of 19.3 billion kronor ($2.9
billion) and earnings before interest, taxes and amortization of
1.25 billion kronor in 2010, according to the company&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanlam Ltd. (SLM), South Africa&#8217;s largest
insurer, said it&#8217;s in talks to buy U.S. lender JPMorgan Chase 
Co.&#8217;s fund administration unit to expand in its home market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insurer&#8217;s investment unit will form a joint venture
with the asset management arm of London-based Old Mutual Plc (ONL) to
buy the operation, which oversees about 1 trillion rand ($127
billion), Johan van der Merwe, head of Sanlam (SLM)&#8217;s investment unit,
said by telephone from Cape Town today. Juliana Wheeler, a
spokeswoman for JPMorgan in London, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. lender bought the South African fund-services
business, formerly called TASC Administration, from Sanlam in
2004 to provide payment-processing and cash-management services
for money managers. TASC was South Africa&#8217;s largest independent
third-party administrator, with 140 employees, 15 clients and
about 320 billion rand of assets under administration, JPMorgan
said at the time. The Sanlam and Old Mutual (OML) units are JPMorgan&#8217;s
largest fund-service clients in South Africa, according to
Sanlam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPMorgan had very good intentions when it started the
business but has strategically decided to exit,&#8221; van der Merwe
said. &#8220;JPMorgan is being very accommodating.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old TASC unit now has at least 200 employees who are
likely to be moved into Sanlam and Old Mutual&#8217;s joint-venture
company, Van der Merwe said. Diane Radley, chief executive
officer of Old Mutual Investment Group in South Africa, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to a telephone message seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Absa, Cadiz &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund administration unit is part of New York-based
JPMorgan&#8217;s treasury and securities operation, which posted a 3
percent decline in fourth-quarter profit from the year-earlier
period. The bank began offering rand-clearing services in South
Africa in November for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maitland Group, a European-based fund administrator, is
JPMorgan&#8217;s largest competitor in South Africa, according to
Andre le Roux, business development manager for Maitland, who
said his company has about 920 billion rand in funds under
administration in South Africa. His firm is seeking to win
clients from JPMorgan including Absa Asset Management Ltd., and
Cadiz Holdings Ltd. (CDZ), he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old Mutual fell 1.7 percent to 146.1 pence in London
trading today. Sanlam slid 1.2 percent to 29.95 rand by the 5
p.m. close in Johannesburg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banco Bradesco SA and Itau Unibanco
Holding SA, Brazil&#8217;s largest private banks, declined after
JPMorgan Chase  Co. scrapped an &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on the
stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bradesco fell 2.5 percent to 32.12 reais at 1:21 p.m in Sao
Paulo, while Itau lost 2.8 percent, the most since Nov. 17, to
35.11 reais. The MSCI Brazil (MXBR)/Financials Index was down 2.6
percent, the worst performance among 10 industry groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks were cut to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;overweight&#8221; by
JPMorgan equity analyst Saul Martinez, according to a note sent
to clients today. &#8220;Investors should rotate out of these
stocks&#8221; and select Banco do Brasil SA and smaller banks such as
Banco do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul SA, he wrote in the note.
&#8220;The ample valuation rerating story for Itau and Bradesco has
mostly run its course.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s central bank has cut borrowing costs for four
straight meetings since Aug. 31 to stimulate growth in the
world&#8217;s sixth-largest economy. Since then, Bradesco gained 14
percent while Itau was up 22 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banco do Brasil dropped 0.6 percent today to 26.88 reais,
and has gained 0.6 percent since the central bank began its
monetary easing cycle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chevron Corp (CVX).-led TengizChevroil
LLP project produced 0.4 percent less crude oil in 2011 than the
previous year, according to the Kazakh venture&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TengizChevroil&#8217;s output fell to 25.8 million metric tons of

&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Rajat Gupta, the former
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Procter  Gamble Co. director who
has denied U.S. charges he leaked stock tips to Raj Rajaratnam,
are investigating whether the hedge fund manager had a different
inside source at the companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a Manhattan court conference Jan. 20, defense attorney
Gary Naftalis complained federal prosecutors hadn&#8217;t turned over
documents he wanted on whether Rajaratnam or others at his hedge
fund, Galleon Group LLC, had a source inside Goldman Sachs or
PG other than Gupta, a transcript of the proceeding stated.
Gupta is accused of leaking information about both companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the hearing, Naftalis said Gupta&#8217;s defense may turn on
whether &#8220;there are people at Goldman Sachs and at Procter 
Gamble who are giving out inside information, whether it be
about Goldman or Procter  Gamble or affiliates.&#8221; That would
&#8220;constitute real exculpatory information for a real defense
that the source of any information here is not us but somebody
else.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant U.S. Attorney Reed Brodsky told the judge that
prosecutors had &#8220;no information, zero, no witness statements,
no documents, no type of any kind that anyone other than Mr.
Gupta tipped Mr. Rajaratnam or anyone at Galleon about material
nonpublic information of Goldman or of Procter  Gamble,&#8221;
according to the transcript. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the conclusion of the discussion, U.S. District Judge
Jed Rakoff told Naftalis the government is &#8220;going to give you
Mr. X, they&#8217;re going to point you to at least areas where they
think Mr. X&#8217;s possible involvement in leaking information comes
up in the stuff you have.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naftalis didn&#8217;t return a call seeking comment on the
hearing. Paul Fox, a spokesman for PG, and David Wells, a
spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a hearing Jan. 17, Brodsky said the witnesses for Gupta
may include Goldman Sachs director Claes Dahlback and Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) reinsurance chief Ajit Jain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta, who faces trial in April on five counts of
securities fraud and one count of conspiracy, faces as long as
20 years in prison if convicted on each of the securities fraud
charges and as long as five years if convicted of conspiracy,
according to the government. He also faces a fine of as much as
$5 million. Rajaratnam is serving an 11-year prison term after
being convicted of directing the biggest hedge fund insider
trading scheme in U.S. history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are U.S. v. Gupta, 11-cr-00907, and SEC v. Gupta,
11-cv-07566, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Blavatnik Opposes JPMorgan Delay Over Lawyer&#8217;s Heart Surgery &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billionaire Len Blavatnik, who is suing JPMorgan Chase 
Co. over claims it lost 10 percent of the $1 billion it managed
for him, refused to extend the fact-gathering period as
requested by a bank lawyer about to have open-heart surgery, the
lawyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bruce Birenboim, an attorney for JPMorgan, explained
Blavatnik&#8217;s refusal in a letter to a Manhattan judge Jan. 27.
Birenboim said Blavatnik wouldn&#8217;t extend the schedule two months
to June 29, a request Birenboim made because he will be
unavailable for six to eight weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have never in my 30 years of practice found an
adversary&#8217;s position to be so unprincipled and unprofessional,&#8221;
Birenboim, a partner at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton  Garrison
LLP, wrote to New York State Supreme Court Justice Melvin L.
Schweitzer. He said Blavatnik and his lawyers &#8220;have chosen to
litigate this matter without regard&#8221; for &#8220;common civilities&#8221;
and &#8220;professional courtesies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blavatnik, 54, sued in 2009, claiming that New York-based
JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, put twice as much
money into risky mortgages as his investment guidelines allowed
while Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon was unloading such
securities from the bank&#8217;s books. Blavatnik says the bank lost
$98 million of his funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blavatnik, born in Ukraine, runs New York-based Access
Industries Group, which owns energy, media and real-estate
companies. Blavatnik is worth $9.5 billion, according to Forbes.
Blavatnik bought Warner Music Group Corp. from Edgar Bronfman
last year. &lt;/p&gt;

Inc., 601924-09, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Schwab Suit Against Merrill Wins Judge&#8217;s Tentative Go-Ahead &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit, Wells Fargo Co. (WFC)
and UBS AG (UBSN) must face a lawsuit by Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW) alleging
they misled the company about the risks of $100 million worth of
mortgage-backed securities it bought from them, a California
judge ruled tentatively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Richard Kramer in San Francisco said Jan. 27 that he
intends to let claims over 46 of the 50 securitizations at issue
proceed. The four claims he rejected, because they were filed
too late, involved securities from Countrywide Financial Corp.,
the mortgage lender acquired in 2008 by Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is my tentative ruling that those four securitizations
are barred by the statute of repose,&#8221; Kramer said at a hearing
Jan. 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwab, an independent San Francisco-based brokerage,
alleged in a 2010 lawsuit that the securities dealers lied or
didn&#8217;t disclose information about loans underlying the bonds
they sold, including the loan-to-value ratios of mortgages and
the number of properties that were not primary residences,
according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is one of several pending in state courts around
the country by investors seeking repayment for mortgage-backed
securities. The Federal Home Loan Banks of Seattle, San
Francisco, Pittsburgh, Chicago and Indianapolis, as well as
companies including Schwab and Allstate Insurance Co., have sued
investment banks under state investor-protection laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Charles Schwab v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner
 Smith, 10-501151, California Superior Court (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mets Owners Ask Judge to Dismiss Madoff Trustee&#8217;s Claims &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Mets&#8217; owners asked a judge to dismiss $386
million in remaining claims brought by the trustee liquidating
Bernard Madoff&#8217;s firm, saying their &#8220;early faith&#8221; in Madoff
was well-founded because of his reputation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff threw out most of trustee
Irving Picard&#8217;s $1 billion in claims against the team owners.
The judge said Picard must prove they were willfully blind to
the convicted Ponzi schemer&#8217;s crimes if he wants to recoup money
they withdrew from their Madoff accounts, the Mets owners noted.
Since Picard hasn&#8217;t proved that, he has no case against them,
they argued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Defendants trusted their broker, Bernard L. Madoff, and
never suspected him of any fraud, let alone a Ponzi scheme,&#8221;
team owners Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz said in a court filing
Jan. 26. Picard can&#8217;t show they believed there was &#8220;a high
probability&#8221; that Madoff was running a Ponzi scheme or that
they took &#8220;deliberate action&#8221; to avoid seeing what was going
on, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mets owners, after losing money in the Ponzi scheme and
an income stream from Madoff, have said they are trying to sell
stakes in the Major League Baseball team. Picard&#8217;s claims remain
a threat to their finances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking Rakoff to rule on one of his remaining claims,
Picard said the Mets owners must return $83 million in
fictitious profits taken from Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme in the two
years before his 2008 arrest. The law allows him to take back
the money simply because the operation was a fraud, he said in a
court filing Jan. 26. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the money, Picard need only prove that Katz and
Wilpon didn&#8217;t give value in return for the money, and they can&#8217;t
possibly prove they did, as they were net winners, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the other $300 million, Picard must prove the Mets
owners were willfully blind to the fraud, Rakoff has said. s
that they didn&#8217;t know of the fraud, Wilpon and Katz attached
testimony from Arthur Friedman, a partner in their company,
Sterling Equities, who handled their investments with the Madoff
firm, depositing checks, making withdrawals and trying to
duplicate Madoff&#8217;s investment strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. Katz, 11-cv-03605, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New Suits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goldman Sued by Stichting Pensioenfonds in New York &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was sued by the Netherlands&#8217;
biggest retirement fund, accusing the investment bank of making
false or misleading statements in selling residential mortgage-
backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP (ADPZ) sued New York-based Goldman
Sachs in New York State Supreme Court Jan. 27, saying that the
bank knew that originators of the loans underlying the
investments hadn&#8217;t followed underwriting standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman knew of, and facilitated, the wholesale and
systematic abandonment of underwriting guidelines by various
third-party originators faced with Goldman&#8217;s demands that as
many loans as possible be originated so that they could be
packaged and sold to investors like plaintiff,&#8221; lawyers for
Stichting said in the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stichting also sued Deutsche Bank AG and JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) over sales of mortgage-backed securities in New York state
court last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stichting, the pension fund for Dutch public educational
and government workers, has more than 250 billion euros ($332.8
billion) in assets under management, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Duvally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment on the lawsuit in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP v. Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., 650264/2012, New York State Supreme Court, New York
County (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Carnival Sued in Miami Over Fatal Costa Concordia Shipwreck &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carnival Corp., the world&#8217;s largest cruise line owner, was
sued in Miami over the Jan. 13 wreck of the Costa Concordia off
the coast of Italy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint, which names six plaintiffs, four Americans
and two Italians, was filed Jan. 27 in state court in Miami,
said attorney Marc J. Bern, who provided Bloomberg with a copy.
The filing couldn&#8217;t be independently confirmed with the court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs were &#8220;in terror of catastrophic injury,
death, drowning, having been placed in a situation where common
sense said the vessel was sinking but the orders from the crew
were to return to their cabins,&#8221; according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bern said he&#8217;s working with an Italian consumer-law group,
Codacons, as well as the New York firm of Proner  Proner. He
said he expects to later sue on behalf of about 1,000 passengers
of the Costa Concordia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carnival Cruise lines, based in Miami, and Costa Cruise
Lines, based in Hollywood, Florida, are named as defendants in
the complaint. Vance Gulliksen, a spokesman for Carnival, said,
&#8220;Since this is pending litigation, we are not in a position to
comment at this time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Carnival ship, carrying 4,200 passengers and crew for a
Mediterranean cruise, struck rocks and ran aground leaving at
least 17 people dead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Scimone v. Carnival Cruise Lines, Circuit Court
of the 11th Judicial Circuit (Miami). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Omnicare Sued by U.S. Regulators to Block Takeover of PharMerica &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators sued Omnicare Inc. (OCR) to block its $440.8
million takeover of rival drug-supply company PharMerica Corp. (PMC),
a deal they said would increase prices for elderly nursing-home
residents covered by Medicare. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Omnicare&#8217;s acquisition of Louisville, Kentucky-based
PharMerica would give it the bargaining leverage to raise
medicine prices for those covered by Medicare prescription drug
plans, passing those costs on to U.S. taxpayers, the Federal
Trade Commission said Jan. 27 in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Omnicare offered $15 a share in August in an unsolicited
bid for PharMerica, which the Covington, Kentucky-based company
extended Jan. 27 for a fourth time before the FTC&#8217;s
announcement. The regulators&#8217; complaint leaves little room for
Omnicare to make changes or negotiate further, probably killing
the deal, said A.J. Rice, an analyst with Susquehanna Financial
Group LLP in New York. That would make PharMerica attractive to
private-equity firms, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An acquisition would give Omnicare control of as much as 60
percent of the market to distribute drugs to nursing homes,
hospitals and hospices, said Jeff Jonas, an analyst with Gabelli
 Co. in Rye, New York. Omnicare already is the largest such
supplier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If Omnicare is allowed to purchase its biggest and only
national competitor, it will diminish competition and raise
health-care costs, leaving taxpayers and patients to foot the
bill,&#8221; said Richard Feinstein, director of the FTC&#8217;s bureau of
competition, in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Omnicare said in a statement that it disagrees with the FTC
decision and the deal for PharMerica would help lower costs. The
company sought the acquisition to save money through automation
and scale amid U.S. cuts to health-care spending, Omnicare Chief
Executive Officer John Figueroa&#160;said when the bid was announced
in August. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Former Groupon Sales Reps Countersue Over &#8216;Abusive&#8217; Tactics &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Groupon Inc. (GRPN) sales managers countersued the company,
which had accused them of taking trade secrets to Google Inc. (GOOG) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groupon, the world&#8217;s largest online coupon site, sued two
former managers in October after they left to join Google
Offers, a competing venture. Lawyers for the managers accused
Groupon of using &#8220;sham litigation&#8221; to bully and silence
employees and obtain intelligence on a burgeoning competitor,
according to court papers filed Jan. 25 in an Illinois state
court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In its stop-at-nothing strategy to take itself public and
further enrich its founders, Groupon has crossed the line,&#8221;
lawyers for the managers said. &#8220;This counterclaim seeks to put
an end to that abusive and illegal behavior.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The filing accused Groupon of hiring &#8220;out-of-work young
people&#8221; based on false promises and using a complicated
compensation scale to undercut commissions and implement
unrealistic sales quotas. As morale waned among employees ahead
of the company&#8217;s initial public offering, Groupon filed the
lawsuit and several others like it in an attempt to silence
workers, lawyers for the managers said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This suit also signaled to employees that, should they
leave, Groupon would aggressively attempt to prevent them from
working for a competitor, regardless of the legality of Groupon
taking such action,&#8221; lawyers for the managers said in the
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julie Mossler, a spokeswoman for Groupon, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a phone call and e-mail seeking comment on
the counterclaims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Groupon Inc. v. Hanna, 11CH36731, Cook County,
Illinois, Circuit Court, Chancery Division (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cantor Couldn&#8217;t Mitigate Effect of Four Departures, Court Told &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cantor Fitzgerald LP, suing four managing directors in Hong
Kong who left to join a China-backed investment bank, had no
opportunity to mitigate the situation, the New York brokerage&#8217;s
lawyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Four people from an organization leave in an abrupt
manner on the same day,&#8221; Cantor&#8217;s lawyer Nicholas Cooney said
in his closing arguments Jan. 27. &#8220;They didn&#8217;t have time to
bring others up to speed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason Boyer, the former head of Cantor&#8217;s Hong Kong
business, and Bradford Ainslie - formerly of its Asian cash
equities desk - last week told Judge A.T. Reyes that their
resignations were independent of each other. Together with Brett
McGonegal and Uwe Parpart, Cantor&#8217;s former Asia chief economist
and strategist, they joined Reorient Financial Markets Ltd.,
backed by an asset manager under China&#8217;s State-owned Assets
Supervision and Administration Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Employees are allowed to discuss amongst themselves plans
for the future under the law,&#8221; Ashley Burns, a lawyer
representing McGonegal and Ainslie told the court Jan. 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cantor accuses the four defendants of breaching their
employment contracts and said the departure of the four caused a
29 percent drop in its average monthly revenue in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reyes reserved his judgment, saying he would rule as soon
as possible. He declined to seal portions of documents detailing
Cantor&#8217;s past revenue and expenses, as well as how the brokerage
calculated compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Cantor Fitzgerald Europe, Cantor Fitzgerald
(Hong Kong) Capital Markets Ltd. and Jason Boyer, Bradford
Ainslie, Brett McGonegal, Uwe Henke von Parpart, HCA1160/2011 in
Hong Kong&#8217;s Court of First Instance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;U.S. Asks Appeals Court to Affirm $7.2 Billion Picower Deal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. asked a federal appeals court to affirm a $7.2
billion forfeiture by the Jeffry Picower estate, to be used to
compensate investors who lost money in Bernard Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi
scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A challenge by Adele Fox was &#8220;frivolous,&#8221; and it wouldn&#8217;t
serve justice to let her intervene in a deal that &#8220;in no way
impairs Fox&#8217;s rights,&#8221; the U.S. said in a court filing in New
York. Fox, a former Madoff investor, sought to overturn the
settlement because it gave Madoff trustee Irving Picard priority
in dealing with the Picower estate, and barred her from suing
the estate herself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fox, in addition to making &#8220;irrelevant&#8221; arguments, is
&#8220;single-handedly holding up the distribution of more than $7.2
billion of funds to Madoff&#8217;s victims in desperate need of those
funds,&#8221; Matthew Schwartz, an assistant U.S. attorney, wrote in
a Jan. 26 filing. He asked the court to dismiss Fox&#8217;s appeal of
a lower-court ruling affirming the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fox said she is among the Ponzi scheme&#8217;s so-called net
winners, who took out more money than they put in. The trustee
and the government have determined that &#8220;not a penny of the
forfeiture&#8221; by the Picower estate will go to her and other net-
winner investors, she said in her appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picower, one of Madoff&#8217;s largest investors, may have
suspected the con man was running a Ponzi scheme, according to
Picard. Picower drowned in 2009 and his estate forfeited the
money to the U.S. and Picard to settle the trustee&#8217;s claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. $7.2 billion, 11-2898, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit (New York). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;One Stanford Client Lost $20 Million, Ex-Executive Testifies &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former Stanford Group Co. executive told a jury that one
client of R. Allen Stanford&#8217;s securities brokerage lost at least
$20 million before the business was closed by U.S. regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason Green, who led Stanford Group&#8217;s private client group,
made that statement while being cross-examined by the
financier&#8217;s lawyer on the fifth day of Stanford&#8217;s investor fraud
trial at the U.S. courthouse in Houston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford&#8217;s defense lawyers have maintained that all
purchasers of the certificates of deposit issued by his Antigua-
based Stanford International Bank Ltd. and sold by the brokerage
were able to withdraw every penny of their money until the
Securities and Exchange Commission sued in February 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked by defense attorney Ali Fazel if anybody had not
gotten their money back before then, Green replied, &#8220;Yes, one
person I know of specifically&#8221; was denied $20 million. Green
didn&#8217;t identify the client. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford, 61, who was indicted in June 2009, is accused of
leading a $7 billion investment fraud scheme centered on sales
of the CDs. Charged with 14 counts including mail fraud, wire
fraud and obstruction of an SEC probe, he told jurors earlier
this week that he&#8217;s innocent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is  U.S. v. Stanford, 09-cr-342, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston). The SEC
case against Stanford is Securities and Exchange Commission v.
Stanford International Bank, 09-cv-298, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of Texas (Dallas). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perelman&#8217;s MacAndrews  Forbes Loses $16 Million Drapkin Verdict &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ronald Perelman&#8217;s MacAndrews  Forbes Holdings Inc. was
ordered by a jury to pay $16 million to Perelman&#8217;s ex-
lieutenant, Donald Drapkin, after jurors found the billionaire&#8217;s
firm breached a separation agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jurors in Manhattan federal court deliberated for about 90
minutes before returning their verdict Jan. 27 in Drapkin&#8217;s
breach-of-contract lawsuit. They had heard three days of
testimony. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m very happy,&#8221; Drapkin said immediately after the
verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are obviously disappointed&#8221; in the outcome, Barry
Schwartz, executive vice chairman of MacAndrews  Forbes, said
in a statement. &#8220;We believe that the facts unequivocally proved
a substantial breach by Mr. Drapkin. We will review all
appropriate post-trial options.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drapkin, a dealmaker, sued MacAndrews  Forbes in 2009,
saying he was hired by Perelman in the 1980s to serve as vice
chairman and act as in-house investment banker. In court papers,
he said the relationship between the two men had deteriorated so
much by 2006 that Drapkin&#8217;s salary had been slashed and his
responsibilities cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drapkin said he agreed to leave the firm in 2007 in return
for millions of dollars in severance and proceeds from the sale
of his stock. He claimed he wasn&#8217;t paid $16 million. MacAndrews
 Forbes said it withheld the payments because Drapkin breached
the separation agreement by withholding documents and trying to
get Eric Rose, who heads the firm&#8217;s life sciences business, to
leave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge barred evidence about the soured relationship and
said the focus of the trial would be on whether the firm had
breached its contract with Drapkin. As a result, much of the
three days of testimony focused on contract clauses, document

&lt;h2&gt;Carnival Reaches Consumer Settlement as Wreck Sparks Lawsuits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carnival Corp. (CCL)&#8217;s Italian unit said it reached a damage-
settlement agreement with consumer groups, as the company was
sued for the first time in the U.S. over the wreck of the Costa
Concordia cruise ship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costa Crociere SpA agreed to pay 11,000 euros ($14,500) to
every passenger of the cruise ship that ran aground off the
Italian coast on Jan. 13, killing at least 16, plus reimburse
expenses including the cost of the cruise, according to a
statement from the Genoa-based company Jan. 27. The agreement
was reached with consumer groups in countries including Italy,
Germany, France and Spain, a company spokesman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. complaint, alleging negligence and breach of
contract, was filed Jan. 26 in federal court in Chicago by crew
member Gary Lobaton, who seeks class-action status to represent
all victims of the disaster off Giglio Island. A spokesman for
Costa, a unit of Miami-based Carnival, declined to comment on
the U.S. lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italian criminal lawyer Giulia Bongiorno next week will
file a complaint on behalf of clients with Italian prosecutors
investigating the wreck. Concordia&#8217;s Captain Francesco Schettino
was placed under house arrest on Jan. 17 for allegedly causing
the wreck and abandoning the ship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My clients aren&#8217;t happy with just a financial
compensation,&#8221; Bongiorno, who helped overturn the murder
conviction of Amanda Knox&#8217;s former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito
in October, said in a phone interview Jan. 27. The aim is to
request that prosecutors investigate all responsibilities and
not just the captain&#8217;s, she said. Bongiorno, 45, who&#8217;s also a
member of Italy&#8217;s Parliament, will represent more than 50
passengers, Corriere della Sera said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Concordia struck rocks near Giglio after Schettino
deviated from the planned route and steered close to the island,
court documents show. The accident happened hours after the
vessel left a port near Rome on a Mediterranean cruise carrying
about 4,200 passengers and crew. Eighteen are still missing,
though that number probably includes two of the dead who have
not yet been identified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compensation proposal &#8220;is higher than the current
indemnification limits that are provided for in international
conventions and the laws currently in force,&#8221; Costa Crociere
said. Families of victims and injured will be offered a separate
compensation, Costa said. A Costa spokesman declined to
immediately comment on the U.S. lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italian consumer group ADOC estimated that about 3,000
passengers would get about 14,000 euros each if they accept the
offer, including expenses, according to an e-mailed statement.
ADOC forecast 85 percent of passengers will accept the offer.
That would bring the total cost to about 42 million euros.
Carnival has liability cover of as much as $3 billion with the
Standard Club, a mutual insurance association owned by ship
owners, and the Steamship Mutual Underwriting Association Ltd.,
according to spokesmen for the two firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italian consumer group Codacons advised clients not to
accept the offer, according to a statement on its website Jan.
27. The association is putting together a class-action lawsuit
with U.S. law firms Napoli Bern Ripka Shkolnik and Proner Proner
LLP to be filed in Miami, it said. The group is seeking &#8220;at
least&#8221; 125,000 euros per passenger and more than 1 million
euros for &#8220;most serious cases,&#8221; according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) started
marketing a sale of Samurai bonds, the first such offering by a
U.S. bank since the lender&#8217;s own a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. bank will sell five-year fixed-rate bonds
yielding 80 basis points more than the yen swap rate, according
to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. The sale is
slated for Feb. 2, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will also sell same-maturity floating-rate notes
yielding 95 basis points more than the three-month London
interbank offered rate for the yen, said the person, asking not
to be identified as the information is private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank was the first U.S. financial borrower last year to
tap the yen market since the collapse of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. in September 2008. JPMorgan on Feb. 15 raised
111.1 billion yen ($1.45 billion) in Samurai bonds, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The sale was followed by Aflac Inc.
in June, and General Electric Capital Corp. in November, the
data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s last Samurai offering included a 76.9 billion
yen sale of five-year 1.05 percent bonds priced to yield 25
basis points more than the yen swap rate, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The yield premium on the notes rose to
144.7 basis points above the yen swap rate on Dec. 1, before
falling to 114 today, according to Japan Securities Dealers
Association prices on Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Silla Brush" date="Jan 30, 2012 12:01 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-30/goldman-sachs-among-banks-lobbying-to-exempt-half-of-swaps-from-dodd-frank.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Among Banks Fighting to Exempt Half of Swaps Books</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;More than half of the derivatives-
trading business of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Morgan Stanley and
three other large banks could fall largely outside the Dodd-
Frank Act if they succeed in lobbying regulators to exempt their
overseas operations, government records show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debate over the reach of Dodd-Frank has been among the
most contentious aspects of the regulatory overhaul enacted by
President Barack Obama after the 2008 credit crisis. The banks
have met with regulators, testified to Congress and filed dozens
of letters contending that they will suffer a competitive
disadvantage if the regulations apply to their foreign arms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banking lobbyists have been gaining traction with their
argument that a combination of U.S. supervision of their holding
companies and foreign supervision of their operations abroad is
sufficient to oversee risk to the financial system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the banks haven&#8217;t publicized how much of their swaps
business is overseas, they file quarterly statements to the
Federal Reserve. A Bloomberg News analysis of the filings shows
that Goldman Sachs had 62 percent of its $134 billion in fair-
value derivatives assets and liabilities in non-U.S. branches or
subsidiaries for international banking as of Sept. 30, while 77
percent of Morgan Stanley (MS)&#8217;s $101 billion was in non-U.S.
operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If overseas operations aren&#8217;t subject to U.S. rules or
equivalent regulation by other nations, it could impede the goal
of preventing another credit crisis, Darrell Duffie, professor
at Stanford University&#8217;s Graduate School of Business, said in a
telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Not only is that neglectful from a viewpoint of systemic
risk as it sits today, but it&#8217;s also an incitement to move the
risk abroad,&#8221; Duffie said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan and Citigroup &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed filings show that JPMorgan Chase  Co. had 59
percent of its $188 billion in overseas branches or
international affiliates; Citigroup Inc. (C) had 53 percent of $122
billion; and Bank of America Corp. had half of $125 billion in
non-U.S. operations in the same period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fair-value assets and liabilities include the value of
interest rate, foreign exchange, commodity, equity and credit
derivatives that are held for trading purposes and marked at
market prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan uses a different method to determine the size of
its derivatives business, according to a person familiar with
the bank&#8217;s operations. As a consolidated bank, JPMorgan
calculates that it has $30 billion in derivatives exposure once
assets and liabilities are netted. The exposure includes 53
percent, or $16 billion, in foreign branches and subsidiaries,
and 47 percent, or $14 billion, in domestic offices, said the
person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the bank has 
not authorized employees to speak publicly on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Proposed Rules &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen Michael S. Duvally of Goldman Sachs, Mary Claire Delaney of Morgan Stanley, Molly Millerwise Meiners of Citigroup
and Jerry Dubrowski of Bank of America declined to comment. Joe
Pavel, a spokesman for the Federal Reserve, declined to comment
on the reach of Dodd-Frank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks have been focused on rules that the Fed, Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. and Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency proposed in April, requiring capital and margin to be
set aside to reduce risk in non-cleared trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dodd-Frank aims to have most derivatives guaranteed by
clearinghouses that stand between buyers and sellers and traded
on public exchanges or other venues. The law requires regulators
to set capital and margin for trades that remain non-cleared, or
transacted directly between buyers and sellers. Non-cleared
trades can be more profitable for dealers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;No Lesser Risk&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulators said in their April proposal that foreign
swaps pose &#8220;no lesser risk&#8221; to a U.S. company because of their
location and noted that an exemption might allow banks to design
swaps to evade the law by using their overseas affiliates. While
global regulators are looking to establish an international
regulatory system for margin to level the playing field, they
have yet to announce a plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tension about the scope of the rules has its roots in a
part of Dodd-Frank known among lawyers and regulators as 722d,
for its section number in the law. Under the provision, the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which has authority to
regulate most of the U.S. swaps market, may apply its rules to
transactions with a &#8220;direct and significant connection with
activities in, or effect on, commerce of the United States.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dodd-Frank &#8220;expresses clear congressional intent that it
apply to certain extraterritorial activities,&#8221; Dan Berkovitz,
the CFTC&#8217;s general counsel, said last year at a day-long agency
meeting with banks, energy companies and exchanges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goldman Counterparties &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The provision raised the stakes for banks because their
swaps business is global. In 2008, Sally Davies, a Fed adviser,
said that between 55 percent and 75 percent of U.S. banks&#8217;
notional derivatives exposure was with non-U.S. residents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, New York-based Goldman Sachs&#8217;s largest
counterparty for credit derivatives on the eve of the credit
crisis in June 2008 was Deutsche Bank AG (DB)&#8217;s London branch; its
third-largest interest-rate derivatives counterparty was
JPMorgan&#8217;s London branch; and its largest counterparty for
currency products was Royal Bank of Scotland Plc&#8217;s London
branch, according to a 2010 report from the Financial Crisis
Inquiry Commission, a U.S. panel that investigated the crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selling over-the-counter derivatives is among the most
lucrative business for financial companies, with U.S. bank
holding companies reporting $14 billion in trading revenue in
the third quarter of 2011, according to the OCC. The five banks
control 95 percent of cash and derivatives trading for U.S. bank
holding companies, which had $326 trillion in notional
derivatives as of Sept. 30, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Allies in Congress &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In seeking the foreign exemption, the five banks have
enlisted H. Rodgin Cohen and Kenneth M. Raisler, among other
lawyers at New York-based Sullivan  Cromwell LLP. Edward J. Rosen, a New York-based partner at Cleary Gottlieb Steen 
Hamilton LLP, has taken a similar position as representative of
a dozen U.S. and international banks, including UBS Securities
LLC and Barclays Capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lobbying has found allies in Congress and among
regulators as agencies prepare to complete their rules before
2013. Senator Tim Johnson, a South Dakota Democrat and chairman
of the Senate Banking Committee, and Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat and namesake of the law, are
among lawmakers from both parties urging regulators to focus
their rules primarily on the banks&#8217; U.S. businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If those margin rules for foreign operations are
maintained and Europeans and other foreign jurisdictions do not
match it, that would be a significant competitive
disadvantage,&#8221; Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke testified to
Congress on July 21. John Walsh, acting Comptroller of the
Currency, said on Jan. 26 that regulators understand the
industry&#8217;s concerns and will be &#8220;carefully considering all of
the issues&#8221; raised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Edge Corporations &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derivatives, including swaps, are financial contracts tied
to interest rates, commodities or events, such as the default of
a company. The values of overseas derivatives held by individual
banks that were calculated for this story include assets and
liabilities for foreign branches and subsidiaries, including so-
called Edge corporations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edge corporations, formed under the 1919 Edge Act on
international banking, are bank subsidiaries for which Congress
granted greater leeway to compete overseas. Citibank Overseas
Investment Corp., J.P.Morgan International Finance Limited and
Bankamerica International Financial Corp. are among Edge
subsidiaries that have interest rate and equity derivatives and
could benefit from an exemption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Edge Numbers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks don&#8217;t report the holdings of Edge corporations in
their standard quarterly filings. According to documents
obtained through a public records request to the Fed, Citibank&#8217;s
Edge corporation had a combined $7.8 billion in fair-value
derivatives as trading assets and liabilities in the first
quarter of 2011, while JPMorgan&#8217;s had $88 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are seeking to have Edge corporations and other
international affiliates exempted from Dodd-Frank rules when
they have contracts with non-U.S. companies, Sullivan  Cromwell
said in a letter on June 29. The exemption should also cover the
subsidiaries&#8217; swaps with foreign-based affiliates of other U.S.
companies because the trades don&#8217;t have a direct and significant
effect on U.S. commerce, the law firm said in its letter. Under
the requested exemption, two U.S. companies could trade swaps
outside of Dodd-Frank rules so long as their overseas affiliates
engaged in the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of U.S. banking supervision at the parent
company level and foreign regulation of overseas operations is
sufficient to protect the U.S. financial system, according to
the Sullivan  Cromwell lawyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Preventing an AIG &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. and European Union regulators have said they want to
bridge international gaps to avoid disparities that helped
undermine oversight of American International Group Inc. (AIG) in 2007
and 2008 and contributed to a $180 billion taxpayer bailout. The
insurer booked many of its swaps in Europe, where regulators in
2007 decided that U.S. authorities should have oversight. That
transatlantic split &#8220;excluded any comprehensive examination and
regulation&#8221; of AIG&#8217;s credit-default swaps, the U.S.
Congressional Oversight Panel said in a June 2010 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, gaps have emerged since the heads of the G-20
countries, a group consisting of the world&#8217;s richest nations,
met in Pittsburgh in 2009 to plan financial regulatory changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the CFTC approved new limits on speculation in
oil, natural gas and other commodities, while British regulators
oppose hard government-set caps. The U.S. also aims to prohibit
a single dealer from owning and running a swaps-trading venue.
Other G-20 countries say multi-dealer platforms aren&#8217;t essential
to the market overhaul, the Financial Stability Board, an
international panel set up to monitor the implementation of
derivatives rules globally, said in an Oct. 11 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Waiting for SEC &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler said this month that his agency
won&#8217;t complete guidelines on the reach of Dodd-Frank until after
April, while the financial industry waits for a similar proposal
from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Gensler has said
the CFTC may eventually defer to foreign regulators when they
have comparable and consistent regulations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is the obvious place for harmonization -- for
regulators to get together across jurisdictions to work this
out, because otherwise you end up trampling on each other&#8217;s feet
and possibly going at cross purposes,&#8221; Duffie said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barnes  Noble Inc.&#8217;s claim that
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is misusing patents to undermine competition
from Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Android operating system was thrown out by a
U.S. trade judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. International Trade Commission Judge Theodore Essex
rejected today Barnes  Noble&#8217;s arguments the patents should be
held unenforceable, Microsoft Deputy General Counsel David
Howard said in a statement. Essex&#8217;s decision is subject to
review by the six-member commission, which has the power to
block imports of products that violate U.S. patent rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trial on whether bookseller Barnes  Noble&#8217;s Nook e-
reader infringed the four patents, and whether they are valid,
is scheduled to begin Feb. 6 in Washington. Essex separately
today declined to rule in Barnes  Noble&#8217;s favor on two of the
four Microsoft patents, according to a posting on the agency&#8217;s
website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Today&#8217;s action by the ITC makes clear that Barnes 
Noble&#8217;s patent misuse defense was meritless,&#8221; Howard said in an
e-mailed statement. &#8220;This case is only about one thing --
patent infringement by Barnes  Noble&#8217;s Android-based devices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge didn&#8217;t release a public version of his findings.
Notice of the decision was reported earlier by the Fosspatent
Web blog. Mary Ellen Keating, a spokeswoman for Barnes  Noble,
said the company had no comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Licensing Accords &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker, has said it
reached licensing agreements with makers of more than 70 percent
of the Android-based smartphones sold in the U.S. It got a mixed
ruling at the ITC in a case against Motorola Mobility Holdings
Inc., with Essex saying in December that only one of seven
patents asserted by Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft were
infringed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We remain as open as ever to extending a license to
Barnes  Noble, and invite them to join the many other major
device makers in paying for the Microsoft-developed intellectual
property they use in their devices,&#8221; Howard said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnes  Noble, based in New York, has complained to the
U.S. Justice Department that Microsoft is trying to raise costs
to drive out competition by &#8220;asserting trivial and outmoded
patents against manufacturers of Android devices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Barnes  Noble&#8217;s filing in the case, through
several meetings beginning in July 2010, Microsoft said its
patents &#8220;were sufficient to dominate and entirely preclude the
use of the Android operating system by the Nook.&#8221; An offer for
a licensing agreement would have limited Barnes  Noble&#8217;s
ability to upgrade its e-reader and set a rate that was higher
than what it costs to license Microsoft&#8217;s own operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, in its response, said its actions were
appropriate to enforce its patent rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In the Matter of Certain Handheld Electronic
Computing Devices, 337-769, U.S. International Trade Commission
(Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Valero Energy
Corp. (VLO) received notices from the United Steelworkers union of its
intent to strike at refineries in Montana and Texas if a
national labor contract expires tonight without an agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 24-hour notices were for Exxon&#8217;s Billings, Montana,
plant and Valero&#8217;s Port Arthur, Texas, refinery, according to
the companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USW negotiators and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), bargaining in
Austin, Texas, on behalf of the companies, have failed to reach
agreement on a new three-year contract after 14 days of talks.
The national contract expires at midnight Houston time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valero will continue to operate its Port Arthur refinery in
the event of a work stoppage, while closing its Memphis
refinery, Chief Executive Officer Bill Kleese said today on a
conference call with analysts and investors. He confirmed the
Port Arthur notice today at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rachel Moore, an Exxon spokeswoman in Fairfax, Virginia,
confirmed the strike notice for Billings in an e-mail. Exxon&#8217;s
labor agreements with the USW also expire tonight at its
refineries in Beaumont, Texas; Torrance, California; and
Chalmette, Louisiana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deadline Nears &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the deadline nears for contracts covering 30,000 workers
at 69 refineries, companies are deciding whether to shut
refineries or operate them with nonunion workers if the union
should declare a general strike. During negotiations three years
ago, both sides agreed to three, 24-hour rolling extensions of
the contract before a deal was finally worked out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LyondellBasell NV (LYB) will continue to run its Houston refinery
if there&#8217;s a strike, David Harpole, a spokesman for the company
in Houston, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We remain optimistic that a mutually satisfactory
agreement can be reached,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Trained personnel will be
in place at the refinery and ready to assume operations if
necessary.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc (BP/) said in a statement that it would cut output at its
Whiting, Indiana, plant to &#8220;a level that maintains safe winter
operations.&#8221; The company said it wouldn&#8217;t hire replacement
workers because &#8220;that would disrupt the progress BP has made
with the USW in continuing to improve safety and operational
performance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The USW is seeking higher wages, stronger protections for
health and safety and a safety officer assigned to each
facility. Shell has offered wage increases, changes to contract
language related to health and safety practices, while not
agreeing to have a safety process person at each plant, union
sources familiar with the negotiations have said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s
largest energy company by market value, declined after fourth-
quarter sales fell short of analysts&#8217; estimates and oil
production slumped on five continents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue rose 16 percent to $121.6 billion during the
quarter, less than the $124.4 billion average of five analysts&#8217;
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Exxon fell 2.1 percent to
$83.74 at the close in New York after earlier declining as much
as 2.4 percent, the biggest intraday drop since Dec. 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil and natural-gas production declined 8.8 percent during
the final three months of 2011 to the equivalent of 4.53 million
barrels of crude a day, the Irving, Texas-based company said in
an e-mailed statement today. Paul Cheng, a Barclays Capital Plc
analyst, had forecast daily output of 4.719 million barrels in a
Jan. 27 note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a slight negative,&#8221; Brian Youngberg, an analyst at
Edward Jones  Co. in St. Louis, said today in a telephone
interview. &#8220;The company continues to be challenged to grow
production.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income increased to $9.4 billion, or $1.97 a share,
from $9.25 billion, or $1.85, a year earlier, Exxon said. The
per-share result matched the average of eight analysts&#8217;
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asset sales added $810 million to fourth-quarter results,
the company said. Without those proceeds, profit would have
declined from a year earlier, Youngberg said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Africa, Europe &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings from Exxon&#8217;s refining and marketing unit fell 63
percent to $425 million for the quarter, down from $1.15 billion
a year earlier. Chemical profit tumbled 49 percent to $543
million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude output from Exxon&#8217;s wells declined 11 percent,
shrinking in every region where the company conducts operations
except Asia, where production was unchanged, according to
today&#8217;s statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Africa, oil production declined 24 percent. The
company&#8217;s European crude output dropped by 23 percent. Combined,
the two regions account for about one-third of Exxon&#8217;s oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas production fell 6.7 percent worldwide to 13.7 billion
cubic feet a day, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No XTO Benefit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The production declines indicate Exxon has yet to glean any
tangible benefit from its $34.9 billion purchase of XTO Energy
in June 2010, Youngberg said. The transaction was the largest of
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson&#8217;s tenure and
was intended to harness the Fort Worth, Texas-based gas
prospector&#8217;s expertise in penetrating gas- and oil-soaked shale
rock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Production continues to decline and it just shows that
the XTO deal is still not providing any growth,&#8221; Youngberg
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike rivals such as Chesapeake Energy Corp. and
ConocoPhillips, Exxon, the largest U.S. gas producer, isn&#8217;t
cutting back on gas production in response to tumbling prices,
David Rosenthal, Exxon&#8217;s vice president of investor relations,
said today during a conference call with investors and analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some rigs that had been focusing on finding gas in shale
and other unconventional formations have been shifted to
prospects laced with so-called natural-gas liquids, such as
propane and butane, Rosenthal said. Gas liquids are 10 to 15
times more valuable than the methane alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rich in Liquids &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is targeting liquids-rich prospects in Oklahoma
and West Texas this year, he said. In the Bakken shale formation
that lies beneath North Dakota and Montana, Exxon boosted
fourth-quarter oil production by 41 percent from a year earlier,
Rosenthal said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two wells drilled in Poland to test the possibility of
harvesting gas from shale in Europe were failures, Rosenthal
said. The gas discovered in both wells failed to flow, he said,
without providing details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shale and similarly dense geologic formations have flooded
North America with gas, pushing prices to a decade-low earlier
this month, thanks to advances in horizontal drilling and
hydraulic fracturing that allowed the formerly impervious rocks
to be cracked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rosneft Venture &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tillerson plans to spend as much as $37 billion this year
to drill for crude, construct gas-export terminals and expand
chemical plants. Exxon will present details next month of a $3.2
billion Arctic exploration venture with Russia&#8217;s state-
controlled OAO Rosneft, according to Eduard Khudainatov, CEO of
the Moscow-based oil producer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon agreed to sell most of its interest in a Japanese
refining business to TonenGeneral Sekiyu KK for $3.9 billion,
the Tokyo-based company said on Jan. 29. International energy
companies including Exxon, Chevron Corp. and ConocoPhillips have
been reducing their exposure to refined fuels as slipping demand
in some of the world&#8217;s largest economies curbed profits. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, reported earnings that beat analysts&#8217; estimates as
the company&#8217;s non-pharmaceutical units and cost cutting overcame
losses from generic competition to its best-seller Lipitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter earnings excluding some items were 50 cents
a share, beating by 3 cents the average of 18 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Net income fell 50 percent from a year
earlier to $1.44 billion, or 19 cents a share, after the New
York-based company lost patent exclusivity for the cholesterol
pill Lipitor, Pfizer said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decline in sales from prescription drugs was countered by
revenue increases at the animal health unit and infant nutrition
business, two divisions Chief Executive Officer Ian Read has
said are slated to be spun off or sold. The company reduced
costs by 9 percent in the quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Cost is where they can keep a grip on what operating
income will look like,&#8221; said Aparna Krishnan, an analyst with
IHS Global Insight in London. &#8220;Even 9 percent costs-down still
does not compensate for the 4 percent drop in top-line growth,&#8221;
she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s divestiture of the nutrition and animal health
units is part of Read&#8217;s strategy to shrink the company and focus
on new prescription drugs. Read said today those divestitures
are &#8220;on track,&#8221; and the company would announce them this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer fell less than 1 percent to $21.40 at 4:01 p.m. New
York time. The shares have gained 18 percent in the past 12
months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Forecast Trimmed &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer forecast 2012 profit of $2.20 to $2.30 a share, 5
cents less than the previous range of $2.25 to $2.35. &#8220;That
nickel is entirely due to foreign exchange,&#8221; said Chief
Financial Officer Frank D&#8217;Ameilio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors may disregard the reduction, since it&#8217;s
attributable to the exchange rates, Tim Anderson, an analyst
with Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. said in a note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue fell 3.5 percent to $16.7 billion, spurred by a 6
percent drop in sales from its pharmaceutical business to $14.1
billion. Revenue from the animal health unit grew 13 percent to
$1.11 billion, and sales from the infant nutrition unit rose 22
percent to $598 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lipitor Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipitor led the revenue decline. Sales of the drug fell 24
percent to $2 billion. U.S. drug sales declined 15 percent to
$5.46 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These are big blockbuster drugs for Pfizer which are
potentially not going to be growing or not growing as much in
2012,&#8221; Krishnan said in a telephone interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to
be that big gulf that&#8217;s a challenge.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read said the company probably wouldn&#8217;t replicate its
strategy of offering rebates and coupons to hold onto market
share for Lipitor even after copycats entered the market. &#8220;The
Lipitor opportunity is unique in its size,&#8221; Read said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest cuts to expenses came from research and
development spending, which fell 17 percent to $2.33 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter net income a year earlier was $2.89 billion,
or 36 cents, when the company enjoyed exclusive rights to its
best-selling product Lipitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is awaiting U.S. approval in March of its blood
thinner, Eliquis, developed with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. to
prevent stroke in heart patients, a market estimated at $7
billion to $9 billion by Leerink Swann  Co. analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, Pfizer also plans to start selling its
pneumococcal vaccine, Prevnar-13, for adults over 50 in March.
The company&#8217;s two Prevnar vaccines are Pfizer&#8217;s number-three
product, with $834 million in combined fourth-quarter sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After losing exclusive rights to sell Lipitor (PHAM1150) in the fourth
quarter, Pfizer will also face competition from copycat versions
of erectile dysfunction pill Viagra at the end of March. The
&#8220;little blue pill&#8221; was Pfizer&#8217;s sixth best-selling product in
the fourth quarter. Its sales rose 5 percent to $523 million. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian Kuritzky of Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) is among a group of Wall Street executives seeking to
raise more than $300,000 for cancer research by racing up 1,576
steps in New York City&#8217;s Empire State Building. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 35th annual Empire State Building Run-Up is scheduled
for 8 p.m. on Feb. 8. For the second straight year, the Multiple
Myeloma Research Foundation, or MMRF, is the title sponsor and
benefiting charity. Approximately 5,000 people in the race&#8217;s
history have reached the finish line on the 86th floor
observation deck, organizers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event was invitation-only before last year, with
participants selected by its organizer, the New York Road
Runners. The Empire State Building Run-Up now features a wave of
100 charity runners for competitors who have committed to raise
a minimum of $2,500 for the MMRF. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuritzky, a 25-year-old securities analyst at Goldman
Sachs, was the fastest of last year&#8217;s MMRF PowerTeam members.
His time of 13 minutes, 38 seconds earned the former Cornell
University soccer player a place in this year&#8217;s Invitational
Wave, where he&#8217;ll compete against runners from around the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The competition will be fierce, but I know that, with
every person I pass, I&#8217;m raising more money to help the MMRF
fight cancer,&#8221; Kuritzky, who is collecting pledges from
colleagues to raise $10,000 for every runner he passes, said in
a statement. &#8220;That&#8217;s all the motivation I need.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mother&#8217;s Cancer &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuritzky, whose mother died of breast cancer when he was
15, has run the New York City marathon and an 140.6-mile iron-
distance triathlon to raise funds for cancer research. He&#8217;s part
of a three-member Goldman Sachs team taking part in the MMRF
Run-Up Challenge, which presents two trophies to corporate
teams. Goldman Sachs last year won both the NYC Triumph Cup for
the fastest team and the Spirit of Giving Cup for the most funds
raised for charity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other companies in the competition include Barclays Plc (BARC),
Citigroup Inc. (C), Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), Google Inc. (GOOG), JPMorgan
Chase  Co., Morgan Stanley (MS), Royal Bank of Canada and Wells
Fargo  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christine Kenney, a 33-year-old assistant vice president in
equity capital markets for Citigroup, is defending her title
after finishing first among women in the charity division last
year with a time of 16:04. Kenney, the top-finishing female
amateur at the 2011 Cozumel Ironman triathlon, said her team has
raised more than $15,000 in donations over the past four days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Many of the people who have donated so far have told me
their personal stories and how MM has affected their loved
ones,&#8221; Kenney said in an e-mail. &#8220;I&#8217;m running in their honor.
Last year being top female was very much a surprise since I had
not done any stair training. I had no idea what to expect and
it&#8217;s definitely a challenge.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course record of 9:33 was set by Paul Crake in 2003,
according to the NYRR, which also organizes the New York City
Marathon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iraq&#8217;s legislation doesn&#8217;t prevent
oil companies from signing deals with the central government and
with semi-autonomous authorities in the North, as in the case of
Exxon Mobil Corp., said Adnan al-Janabi, chairman of the
nation&#8217;s Oil and Energy Committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country&#8217;s new energy law has been under study for about
five years amid divisions among the country&#8217;s major political
factions. Al-Janabi said yesterday he expected a first reading
of the law in Iraq&#8217;s parliament next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With or without the law, I don&#8217;t think there is anything
to constrain any company from operating anywhere in Iraq,&#8221;
Janabi told reporters in London today. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see any
legality in announcing anyone as being blacklisted.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Baghdad government has refused to recognize production-
sharing agreements signed by Kurdish regional authorities with
foreign companies without its approval. Hussain al-Shahristani,
deputy prime minister for energy affairs, said last month the
Iraqi government was &#8220;weighing measures&#8221; that may be taken
against Exxon after it signed contracts the government considers
illegal with authorities in the Kurdish region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Ercan Ersoy" date="Jan 31, 2012 10:16 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-31/glaxo-lilly-pfizer-said-to-be-interested-in-turkey-s-mn-pharma.html"><headline>Glaxo, Lilly, Pfizer Said to Eye Stake in Turkey&#8217;s MN Pharma</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK), Eli Lilly  Co.
and Pfizer Inc. (PFE) are among about half a dozen companies
interested in buying a stake in Mustafa Nevzat Ilac Sanayii AS
in a deal that may value the Turkish drugmaker at $1 billion,
three people with knowledge of the situation said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owners of Mustafa Nevzat, or MN Pharmaceuticals as the
Istanbul-based generic drugmaker is known, have hired Bank of
America Merrill Lynch to advise on the stake sale, said the
people, who declined to be identified because the plans are
confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mylan Inc (MYL). and Abbott Laboratories (ABT) are also among the
companies interested in bidding, they said. Merrill Lynch has
sent so-called teasers to potential bidders and non-binding bids
have begun to arrive, one of the people said, adding that the
process started late last year. Preliminary bidding may be
completed within two months, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two other Turkish pharmaceutical companies -- Abdi Ibrahim
Ilac Sanayi  Ticaret, the country&#8217;s largest, and Biofarma
Pharmaceutical Industry Co. -- have failed in efforts to sell
stakes over the past two years. While Glaxo is seeking deals in
emerging markets, it&#8217;s becoming harder to find acquisitions that
make &#8220;financial sense,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer Andrew Witty
said last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MN&#8217;s owners, the children and grandchildren of the founder
Mustafa Nevzat Pisak, have yet to decide whether to sell a
minority or majority stake in the closely held company, two of
the people said. The owners are seeking a price that values the
company at 15 to 20 times earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, one of the people
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Targeting Turkey &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkey has been a popular target for deals in recent years,
with companies seeking to tap its $735 billion economy, which
grew 8.2 percent in the third quarter of 2011, the fastest rate
among the Group of 20 countries after China. Zentiva NV (ZEN), a Czech
drugmaker bought by Sanofi in 2009, bought 75 percent of the
generic-drug unit of Turkey&#8217;s Eczacibasi in 2007 for 460 million
euros ($613 million), and later purchased the remaining 25
percent stake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cengiz Sezen, MN&#8217;s chairman, and Chief Executive Officer
Levent Selamoglu didn&#8217;t respond to e-mailed questions about
possible talks or return phone calls seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glaxo, the U.K.&#8217;s largest drugmaker, is interested in
acquiring a pharmaceutical company in Turkey as it struggles to
become profitable in the country, the newspaper Hurriyet said
Jan. 29, citing Abbas Hussain, the drugmaker&#8217;s emerging markets
president. Sarah Spencer, a Glaxo spokeswoman, declined to
comment on whether MN is a potential target. Spokesmen for
Abbott, Eli Lilly, Mylan and Pfizer also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;FDA License &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MN was the first Turkish pharmaceutical company to win a
license from the Food and Drug Administration to sell products
in the U.S., according to the company&#8217;s website. International
companies sought to do business with Mustafa Nevzat since it
acquired the FDA license in 2006, Selamoglu said in an interview
Sept. 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s products are largely injectable medications,
Selamoglu said. They range from antidepressants to diabetic
treatments and antipsychotic agents, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eli Lilly and MN were in negotiations that had reached an
&#8220;advanced stage&#8221; to sell drugs in 26 countries in South
America, Asia, Europe and Africa, Selamoglu said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MN generates annual revenue of about $250 million by
selling about 100 million boxes of its products in Turkey,
Selamoglu said. The country&#8217;s drug market was $9.2 billion in
2010, according to the website of the Istanbul-based
Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association of Turkey. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider, is
acquiring Worklight Inc., a closely held maker of software for
smartphones and tablets to enhance its mobile-service offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worklight&#8217;s software accelerates the delivery of employee
and consumer mobile applications to multiple devices and enables
secure connections to a company&#8217;s information-technology
systems, Armonk, New York-based IBM said today in a statement.
Terms of the deal weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the software, an organization can write single mobile
applications to operate across any device including Apple Inc.&#8217;s
iPhone, Research In Motion Ltd. (RIMM)&#8217;s BlackBerry and devices using
Google Inc.&#8217;s Android operating system. That saves time and
money while better managing employee access and creating more
consistent consumer applications, said Bob Sutor, vice president
of IBM Mobile Platform in telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has said it plans to spend about $20 billion on
acquisitions from 2011 to 2015, and has bought more than 100
companies since 2003. IBM last year acquired companies including
Tririga Inc., i2, Algorithmics, Q1 Labs, and Curam Software,
extending &#8220;Smarter Commerce&#8221; efforts, as it expands offerings
to business customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Linking to Employees &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The big difference here is the link between businesses to
employees, so they can increase their productivity and transform
the way they work,&#8221; said Marie Wieck, general manager of IBM
application and infrastructure middleware, who spoke in the same
interview. It also helps companies &#8220;reach their partners and
their customers, who are increasingly using this for their own
productivity as well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2006 by Chief Executive Officer Shahar Kaminitz,
Worklight is headquartered in New York, with research and
development in Israel, according to its Website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM today also introduced new software it calls Endpoint
Manager for Mobile Devices, which helps companies manage and
secure devices used by employees, including their personal
phones or tablets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offering allows employers to remotely set policies,
identify potential data compromises and wipe data from lost or
stolen devices, and configure and enforce password and
encryption policies, IBM said in a separate statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adrian Mowat, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s
Hong Kong-based chief Asian and emerging-market strategist,
comments on the outlook for markets. Mowat was speaking at a
press briefing in Manila today: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On emerging markets: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Emerging markets will perform very well this year. The
reason I believe that is inflation was a problem for the major
emerging markets in 2011. It is no longer the problem. We are
seeing growth slowing down, but the upside of that is we are
seeing inflation coming off. We are beginning to see quite a
number of central banks reducing interest rates. This is the
time that you buy emerging markets, which is when they are at
the end of their rising inflation cycle. Our target for the
emerging-markets index is 1,150. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mowat said he is &#8216;&#8216;overweight&#8217;&#8217; Philippines, Thailand,
Indonesia and South America, &#8216;&#8216;which is experiencing a big
reduction in interest rates and we forecast that to continue. We
are overweight Russia, where we see it as a big beneficiary in
the reduction of the global risk premium. He&#8217;s &#8216;&#8216;underweight&#8217;&#8217;
Turkey and South Africa, and &#8216;&#8216;neutral&#8217;&#8217; on China (SHCOMP) and India. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On China, India and defensive, cyclical stocks: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;We are quite bearish on the Chinese economy. Its equities
markets have done poorly and that tells you a lot of the
slowdown in the economy. There is recognition that China faces
issues with non-performing loans, that it needs to cross-
subsidize a shortage in capital at the local government level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;This year you are going to see much weaker construction
starts in China. One of the big themes we are playing this year
is &#8216;underweight&#8217; commodities because it&#8217;s quite possible that
Chinese steel and cement production will be less this year.
Within China, we have zero exposure to property and building
materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;The Indian market was one the poorest-performing markets
last year. We are beginning to see inflation coming down and we
have had an easing move by the central bank. I like Indian
financials and industrials. I am not &#8216;overweight&#8217; the market
because there&#8217;s a lot of Indian defensive stocks that did well
last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;This year you may want to be selling your defensives and
go long on cyclicals whether those be industrials, technology or
consumer discretionary.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. named Pranav
Thakur as head of fixed income for the Asian region excluding
Japan and Australia to replace Tarun Mahrotri, according to an

&lt;p&gt;Thakur will report to James Kenny, London-based head of

emerging markets alongside Kenny, who has now become the sole

&lt;p&gt;Bloomingdale&#8217;s Chief Executive
Officer Michael Gould is a fan of President Barack Obama&#8217;s
efforts to speed up tourist visas for Chinese and Brazilian
shoppers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing so would create an &#8220;immediate&#8221; surge in retail
sales as foreign shoppers clamor for Marc Jacobs and Kate Spade
designs, Gould said in a telephone interview Jan. 27. The
department store chain is preparing for a potential boom by
tailoring merchandise assortments to Brazilian and Chinese
tastes and advertising outside of the U.S. for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re expecting an enormous uptick in growth,&#8221; Gould
said from the Bloomingdale&#8217;s New York headquarters. &#8220;We have
the kind of brands that are highly respected by these visitors,
and the faster they can get here the better.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama signed an executive order Jan. 19 giving the
Department of Homeland Security and Department of State 60 days
to come up with a plan to process visa applications from China
and Brazil more quickly. The order recommends shortening the
process to three weeks from four months. Visa processing
capacity in China and Brazil must be increased by 40 percent in
the next year, according to the order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting increase in U.S. tourism could create 1.3
million jobs and add $850 billion to the economy by 2020, the
National Retail Federation said in a Jan. 19 report, citing the
U.S. Travel Association. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Washington-based Federation for American Immigration
Reform said Obama&#8217;s order, which calls for less stringent
screening, increases potential for &#8220;terrorism and visa
overstays,&#8221; the group, which advocates tougher border patrol,
said in a statement on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cautious Spending &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Americans are spending cautiously amid slow wage growth,
limited job gains and depressed real estate values. Consumer
spending stalled in December, with purchases little changed
after rising 0.1 percent the prior month, Commerce Department
figures showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, retailers from Saks Inc. to Macy&#8217;s Inc. (M)&#8217;s
Bloomingdale&#8217;s have watched as Chinese and Brazilian shoppers
traveled to cities such as Paris and Rome, where the wait time
for a visa is about 10 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s really stupefying to see the number of Chinese
tourists in Paris,&#8221; Gould said. &#8220;We find it frustrating to see
business going elsewhere.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2000 to 2010, the U.S. Share of global tourism fell to
11 percent from 17 percent, spurred by stricter security
following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, said David French,
head of government relations at the Washington-based NRF. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sagging Dollar &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama&#8217;s plan could help U.S. gain back its share of the
global tourism market, Stephen Sadove, chief executive officer
at Saks Inc. (SKS), said in an emailed statement. The New York-based
luxury department store could see quick surges in business at
its gateway city locations such as New York, San Francisco and
Chicago locations, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Currently, the process is very difficult for citizens
from countries such as China, Brazil and India to obtain tourist
visas,&#8221; Sadove said. &#8220;Additional tourists in the U.S. would
lead to increased revenues in retailing and hospitality.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sagging dollar has also attracted foreign tourists to
the U.S. as they seek to buy clothing and jewelry on the cheap,
French said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Demand for U.S. visas from Brazil, China and India have
spiked immensely as these economies boom,&#8221; French said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;This is a winning situation for retailers
because a key reason overseas visitors want to come is to
shop.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lobbying Congress &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NRF has spent the past year lobbying Congress to
support loosening the visa wait time. NRF President Matthew Shay
visited U.S. officials in Beijing in October to ask for their
help in making travel to the U.S. easier for Chinese tourists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Speeding up the visa process is one of the quickest ways
to boost the U.S. economy,&#8221; Shay said in the Jan. 19 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To appeal to overseas tourists, Bloomingdale&#8217;s is preparing
to tailor assortments to include flashier name brands and logos,
Gould said. Many tourists prefer prominent logos on iconic
American brands. Bloomingdale&#8217;s is currently planning its
overseas marketing campaign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We mainly advertise at airports and through concierge
services at various cities,&#8221; Gould said. &#8220;But we&#8217;re planning
ways to also advertise overseas.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa applications in China went up 34 percent in 2011 from
a year earlier, while Brazil&#8217;s requests went up 42 percent,
Obama said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Flashy Logos &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. brands including Tiffany  Co., Coach Inc., and
Abercrombie  Fitch Co., with flashy logos and luxury appeal,
could benefit from the boost in tourism, Omar Saad, analyst at
International Strategy and Investment Group, wrote in a report
Jan. 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mall of America, the biggest shopping center in the U.S.
with 520 stores, attracts about 3 million international tourists
annually, said Doug Killian, director of tourism marketing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average receipt for a foreign tourist is 2.5 times
higher than a domestic visitor&#8217;s, Killian said in a telephone
interview from Minneapolis, where the mall is located. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the current increase in Chinese visitors, Mall of
America has focused on opening stores for luxury brands
including Michael Kors, Armani and Hugo Boss, Killian said. The
mall has also hired staff with language fluency in Chinese,
Japanese and Spanish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Killian said the mall has also successfully worked with
airlines to offer more flights from China and Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing real increases from China and Brazil, which
would only be higher if the U.S. were to ease visas,&#8221; Killian
said. &#8220;We&#8217;re prepared to see a big boom in business if that
happens.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Rita Nazareth" date="Feb 01, 2012  5:15 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-01/u-s-stock-index-futures-gain-before-manufacturing-data-chevron-advances.html"><headline>U.S. Stocks Advance Amid Optimism About Global Manufacturing</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks advanced, snapping a
four-day decline in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index, amid signs
that manufacturing across the world is strengthening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial (S5FINL) and industrial shares in the SP 500 rose at
least 1.1 percent to lead gains among 10 groups. Morgan Stanley
and Bank of America Corp. added more than 3.2 percent. Whirlpool
Corp. surged 13 percent as the appliance maker projected
earnings that beat forecasts. Technology companies in the
benchmark index rallied to an 11 year-high. Broadcom (BRCM) Corp.
jumped 8.1 percent as it forecast sales that may top estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 increased 0.9 percent to 1,324.09 at 4 p.m. New
York time, following the biggest January advance in 15 years.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 83.55 points, or 0.7
percent, to 12,716.46, trimming an earlier 152-point gain that
sent it above its highest close since May. The Russell 2000
Index of small companies jumped 2.1 percent to 809.66. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The manufacturing is looking pretty good,&#8221; Allan Flader,
a senior vice president at RBC Wealth Management, said in a
telephone interview from Phoenix. His firm oversees $227
billion. &#8220;It shows that there&#8217;s not a contraction going on and
that we&#8217;re progressing and moving forward.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities rallied after data showing manufacturing in the
U.S. grew at the fastest pace in seven months. Factory indexes
in China improved and a U.K. manufacturing gauge jumped to an
eight-month high. In Germany, output grew for the first time
since September. Manufacturing contracted less than initially
estimated in the euro region. A spokesman said Greece expects to
complete talks on a private sector debt swap and a second
international financing deal for the country in the next days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Still Growing&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The news on the economy is better,&#8221; David Sowerby, a
Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based portfolio manager at Loomis
Sayles  Co., which oversees $150 billion, said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;The uncertainty in Europe has diminished. While
corporate profits have been less robust, they are still growing.
That&#8217;s what&#8217;s moving stock prices higher.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 rose 4.4 percent for the best January since it
gained 6.1 percent in 1997, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Earnings beat projections at 67 percent of the 209
companies in the SP 500 that reported quarterly results since
Jan. 9, the data show. Profits probably grew 4.6 percent in the
fourth quarter, according to a Bloomberg survey of analysts. The
projection has fallen from 6.2 percent at the end of last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Morgan Stanley (MS) Cyclical Index of companies most-tied to
the economy rallied 1.6 percent. A gauge of homebuilders in SP
indexes jumped 3 percent. Construction spending increased 1.5
percent in December, the biggest gain since August, Commerce
Department figures showed today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Banks Rally &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The KBW Bank Index (BKX) rose 1.7 percent as 23 of its 24 stocks
gained. Morgan Stanley climbed 4 percent to $19.39. Bank of
America added 3.2 percent, the most in the Dow, to $7.36.
Citigroup Inc. (C) advanced 2.9 percent to $31.60. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc., the social-networking website that began
about eight years ago in a Harvard University dorm, filed to
raise $5 billion in an initial public offering. The $5 billion
amount is a placeholder used to calculate fees and may change.
The company hired Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase  Co., Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America, Barclays Plc and Allen  Co.
to manage the IPO. The announcement came after the close of
regular trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whirlpool (WHR) surged 13 percent to $61.64 after also reporting
a 20 percent gain in fourth-quarter profit. Cost reductions and
price increases &#8220;positively impacted&#8221; the results last
quarter, the company said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Technology Shares &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A measure of technology shares in the SP 500 gained 0.9
percent as some of the industry&#8217;s largest companies rallied.
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the largest software maker, advanced 1.2
percent to $29.89. Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) increased 2.8 percent to
$28.76. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 2.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadcom jumped 8.1 percent to $37.13. The company is
benefiting from demand for radio chips that help Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s
smartphones and tablets connect over Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
signals. Apple&#8217;s phone sales more than doubled to 37 million in
the quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casino companies gained after revenue in Macau, the world&#8217;s
largest gambling hub, rose 35 percent in January. MGM Resorts
International (MGM) climbed 5 percent to $13.70. Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS)
increased 2.2 percent to $50.18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AOL Inc. (AOL) soared 9.6 percent to $17.76. Profit exceeded
analysts&#8217; estimates as display advertising sales gained for the
fourth straight period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) tumbled 7.7 percent, the most in the SP
500, to $179.46. Sales missed estimates, signaling that its
investments in media services, Kindle devices and shipping
promotions have been slow to pay off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Near-Monopoly&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NYSE Euronext (NYX) slid 0.5 percent to $26.43. European Union
regulators vetoed the plan by Deutsche Boerse AG and NYSE
Euronext to create the world&#8217;s biggest exchange after concluding
that the merger would have led to a &#8220;near-monopoly&#8221; in
European exchange-traded derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strategists at the biggest banks are capitulating on their
bearish forecasts after the best start to a year for global
stocks since 1994. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just two weeks after saying that investors should &#8220;remain
cautious,&#8221; Larry Hatheway, the chief economist at UBS AG,
raised his recommendations on global shares and high-yield bonds
in a Jan. 23 note to customers entitled, &#8220;Wrong, but not too
late.&#8221; Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, and Benoit Anne, the
global head of emerging-markets strategy at Societe Generale SA,
said their estimates for developing nations were proven wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI All-Country World Index (MXWD) climbed 5.7 percent in
January, surprising strategists at Bank of America Corp. (BAC),
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Barclays Plc who had forecast
first-half losses because of Europe&#8217;s debt crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In hindsight, everybody was so beared up at the end of
last year,&#8221; Mary Ann Bartels, the New York-based head of
technical and market analysis at Bank of America, who predicted
on Dec. 27 that the SP 500 would probably fall about 15 percent
in the first half before recovering, said in a Jan. 31 phone
interview. &#8220;There was nowhere for the market to go but up.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Joe Carroll" date="Feb 01, 2012  4:42 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-01/exxon-shale-failure-in-poland-may-lengthen-gazprom-s-shadow-3-.html"><headline>Exxon Shale Failure in Poland May Lengthen Gazprom&#8217;s Shadow</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s failed shale-gas
wells in Poland may hobble the nation&#8217;s effort to become one of
the world&#8217;s major energy sources and dismantle Russian dominance
of Eastern European natural-gas markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the world&#8217;s largest energy company by market value,
said two exploratory wells drilled in a Polish shale formation
last year weren&#8217;t commercially viable. The gas discovered in the
wells, Exxon&#8217;s first in Poland, failed to flow in sufficient
quantities to justify bringing them into production, David Rosenthal, vice president for investor relations, said during a
conference call yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International energy prospectors, including Marathon Oil
Corp. (MRO), Chevron Corp. (CVX) and Talisman Energy Inc. (TLM), are probing
Poland&#8217;s shale deposits to see if drilling techniques that
revolutionized U.S. gas production can unleash reserves big
enough to supply Polish demand for more than three centuries.
Exxon&#8217;s setbacks suggest Poland&#8217;s shale poses unique challenges
that may increase costs and delay output, said Gianna Bern,
founder of Brookshire Advisory  Research in Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Shale exploration is a very high-cost and high-risk
business and the Polish shale market is still in its infancy,&#8221;
Bern, who advises major oil companies on risk management and
strategy, said in a telephone interview yesterday. &#8220;It&#8217;s early
in the game for Poland, and they have significant potential
reserves over there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reduce Imports &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poland&#8217;s shale formations hold 187 trillion cubic feet of
recoverable gas, according to an April 2011 assessment by the
U.S. Energy Department. Those resources are 32 times larger than
the country&#8217;s conventional gas reserves and enough to supply
domestic consumption for 322 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Poland, successfully unlocking gas from shale would be
a boon to domestic manufacturers and power producers by
diminishing the need for Russian imports that now supply two-
thirds of demand, said Benjamin Schlesinger, president of
Benjamin Schlesinger and Associates Inc., a Bethesda, Maryland-
based adviser to gas producers, utilities, regulators and
financial-services firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poland&#8217;s dominant gas company, Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i
Gazownictwo, pays Russia&#8217;s state gas company Gazprom OAO (OGZD) $500
for 1,000 cubic meters ($14.16 per million British thermal
units) of gas. That&#8217;s six times the benchmark U.S. price for the
fuel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Poor Wells &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Poland&#8217;s shale resources are enormous,&#8221; said
Schlesinger, a Stanford University-trained engineer who helped
the New York Mercantile Exchange design its gas futures
contract. &#8220;Poland should be able to capture a good deal of
those resources and reduce reliance on the Russian Federation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gazprom&#8217;s depositary receipts rose 2.5 percent to $12.40,
the highest closing price since Oct. 28. The London-listed
receipts each are worth two ordinary shares in the Moscow-based
company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s failures followed disappointing results at Polish
wells drilled last year by 3Legs Resources Plc and BNK Petroleum
Inc. (BKX) London-based 3Legs&#8217;s Lebien well and BNK&#8217;s Lebork well
flowed at lower rates than similar prospects in the Barnett and
Fayetteville shale regions in the U.S., Sanford C. Bernstein 
Co. said in a Nov. 10 note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Poland is cited among Europe&#8217;s best shale prospects, but
Exxon&#8217;s result supports our caution on achieving material near-
term volumes,&#8221; Oswald Clint, a London-based analyst at
Bernstein, said in a note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, it may be too early to draw any firm conclusions
from Exxon&#8217;s drilling failure, said Pawel Poprawa, who
specializes in shale at the Polish Geological Institute in
Warsaw. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Technological Problem&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If we look at the experience from the U.S. or Canada, no
single well can provide the answer if the basin has potential or
not,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Low flows seem to be a technological
problem.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marathon Oil said today that it&#8217;s evaluating data after
finishing its first well in a Polish shale formation. The
Houston-based company said in a statement that it intends to
drill three more wells during the next few months and withdraw
rock samples for testing. Marathon plans a total of six to seven
Polish shale wells this year, according to the release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Polish shale results come after Exxon encountered a dry
hole in Hungary in late 2009 drilled in a tight-sand deposit
similar to shale. Exxon walked away from the $75 million project
after striking more water than gas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon and other major North American energy producers have
been lured to explore shale prospects from Germany to Argentina
after largely missing out on the boom in shale extraction in the
U.S. that began in the middle of the last decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Smaller Explorers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smaller explorers such as EOG Resources Inc. (EOG), Chesapeake
Energy Corp. (CHK) and Range Resources Corp. (RRC) came to dominate the U.S.
shale industry by default as the biggest international companies
focused on locating billion-barrel offshore crude fields in
places like the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shale formations were ignored by much of the energy
industry for most of the past century because the rocks were
considered too hard to crack using traditional drilling
techniques. That began to change in the late 1990s with the
development of new horizontal drilling practices and more-
intensive hydraulic fracturing that succeeded in unlocking gas
and crude from shale and similarly dense geologic deposits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Attractive Fiscal Terms&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon sought to jump-start its shale program in June 2010
with the $34.9 billion acquisition of XTO Energy, a Fort Worth,
Texas-based pioneer of shale development. In addition to shale
wells and undrilled prospects that stretch from the Mexican
border to Canada, Exxon wanted to transfer XTO&#8217;s in-house
expertise to foreign shale fields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon hasn&#8217;t disclosed its plans for further drilling in
Poland. The shares rose 0.6 percent to $84.23 at 10:44 a.m. in
New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poland has led European shale exploration by virtue of its
tempting geology and by offering &#8220;attractive fiscal terms&#8221; to
prospectors, the Energy Department in Washington said in a
September report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, a &#8220;likely aggressive tax burden&#8221; to be imposed on
shale-gas producers may damp investor enthusiasm, analysts at
Bank Zachodni WBK SA, based in Wroclaw, Poland, said yesterday
in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polish drilling also has been hindered by a scarcity of
rigs, water and specialized equipment needed for shale wells,
Bern said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Getting the things you need to drill these wells is much
more difficult in Poland than in the United States, where the
shale industry is very well-developed,&#8221; Bern said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, said it&#8217;s eliminating a &#8220;small percentage&#8221; of
marketing jobs as part of a previously reported reorganization
of the department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given the rapid changes in technology and the shifts in
how our customers connect with Microsoft, great marketing is
more important than ever to Microsoft&#8217;s future success,&#8221; the
company said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We&#8217;re taking steps to
improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cuts follow a marketing review aimed at reducing
overlapping jobs and better responding to competitors like Apple
Inc. and Google Inc., people with knowledge of the matter told
Bloomberg last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, spent $13.9
billion on sales and marketing in fiscal 2011, a 5.5 percent
increase from the previous year. Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer, who named Chris Capossela as his new marketing chief
last year, didn&#8217;t think the company was getting enough return on
those marketing dollars, the people said in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software maker had 25,000 sales and marketing workers
as of June 30, the end of its fiscal year, the company said in a
filing, without specifying how many focused on marketing. The
company had a total of about 90,000 full-time employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares rose 1.2 percent to $29.89 at the close in
New York. The stock has gained 6.8 percent in the past 12
months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), aiming to take
advantage of a backlash against Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s policy changes, is
rolling out new ads that say its rival is risking users&#8217; privacy
to squeeze more revenue out of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three-day print campaign started today in the Wall
Street Journal, New York Times and USA Today. A blog posting
with the title &#8220;Gone Google? Got Concerns? We Have
Alternatives,&#8221; written by Microsoft spokesman Frank Shaw, was
posted on the company&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google tweaked its Internet search engine last month to
elevate results from friends and its Google+ social network,
irking some rivals, partners and users. Separately, Google
altered its privacy guidelines to create a uniform set of
policies for more than 60 products, unleashing a fresh wave of
criticism from regulators and consumer advocates concerned the
company isn&#8217;t protecting the user information it collects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Every data point Google collects and connects to you
increases how valuable you are to an advertiser,&#8221; Microsoft
says in the first ad of the new campaign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ad also tells readers that &#8220;if these changes rub you
the wrong way, please consider using our portfolio of award-
winning products and services.&#8221; The Redmond, Washington-based
company cited its Hotmail e-mail service, Bing search engine,
Office 365 for online word-processing and spreadsheets, and the
Internet Explorer browser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harder to Control? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The changes Google announced make it harder, not easier,
for people to stay in control of their own information,&#8221; Shaw
wrote in his post. &#8220;We take a different approach.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, based in Mountain View, California, responded to
the remarks today in its own blog posting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Fact: Our privacy controls have not changed. Period,&#8221;
the company said. &#8220;Our users can: edit and delete their search
history; edit and delete their YouTube viewing history; use many
of our services signed in or out; use Google Dashboard and our
Ads Preferences Manager to see what data we collect and manage
the way it is used; and take advantage of our data liberation
efforts if they want to remove information from our services.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also said Microsoft&#8217;s assertion that the
privacy changes were designed to squeeze more ad revenue from
users is false. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The vast majority of the product personalization Google
does is unrelated to ads -- it&#8217;s about making our services
better for users,&#8221; Google said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Social Data &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google&#8217;s search changes were designed to include more data
from a user&#8217;s social circle in query results. That helps the
company promote Google+ and counter features from Microsoft&#8217;s
Bing search, which displays data from Facebook Inc. Facebook has
more than 800 million members, compared with 90 million for
Google+. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Google remains dominant in Internet searches,
Microsoft has gained ground. In December, Bing had 15.1 percent
of U.S. Internet queries, up from 13.9 percent last March,
according to ComScore Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google said the privacy-policy changes were meant to make
the procedures simpler by having a consistent approach across
its services. Data-protection agencies in Ireland and France
have said they will assess the changes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) unit will
take a stake in Lee Robinson&#8217;s Altana Wealth Ltd. after holding
an earlier investment in his previous hedge fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s Petershill fund has exercised its right to invest
in Monaco-based Altana, which Robinson started last year after
leaving Trafalgar Asset Managers, Altana said today in a
statement. Petershill was given the right to invest in any new
venture set up by Robinson, 42, when it bought a 20 percent
stake in Trafalgar in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altana runs three hedge funds, including the Altana
Sovereign Diversity fund, which tries to profit from movement of
wealth to emerging markets from the U.S. and Europe. Trafalgar,
which Robinson founded with former Deutsche Bank AG executive
Theo Phanos, oversaw about $2.8 billion at its peak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robinson, who serves as Altana&#8217;s chief investment officer,
is personally managing a hedge fund at the firm that will invest
in distressed debt, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs started the $1 billion Petershill fund in
2007 to make minority investments in about 15 hedge funds. Its
best investments include buying stakes in Winton Capital
Management, a London-based hedge fund that manages about $26
billion, and Capula Investment Management LLP, a London-based
fund that oversees $12.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2010, Petershill bought a stake in Level Global
Investors LP that became worthless after the $4 billion hedge
fund was shut down following a raid by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation over an insider-trading investigation. Jonathan Sorrell, who oversaw Petershill, stepped down in August to join
Man Group Plc (EMG), the world&#8217;s biggest publicly traded hedge fund,
as head of strategy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s chief
equity trader in Moscow, Peter Kizenko, said he quit to return
to New Jersey and finish building a commercial Russian sauna. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kizenko, who was born in New York, said he decided to
return after 18 years in Moscow because of the growth of
electronic trading and declining compensation in the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fun element has been taken out of it,&#8221; the 45-year-
old said in a telephone interview today. &#8220;The golf course just
got harder, and Moscow is no longer like Chicago in the 1920s
where anything goes. Russia is becoming more refined.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&#8217;s leaving the industry at a time when regulators are
forcing banks to cut back their proprietary trading activities
and lenders themselves are cutting pay. Goldman Sachs, which set
a record for securities-firm pay in 2007, reduced compensation
for the third year in a row after earnings skidded and
protesters denounced Wall Street bonuses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kizenko joined Goldman Sachs in 2006 from UBS AG, where he
was the Swiss bank&#8217;s lead trader in Moscow. Kizenko, whose
parents emigrated from the former Soviet Union, said he is
leaving the company today before returning to the U.S. and the
banya&#8217;s opening next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I am no longer the oldest trader on the Russian market,&#8221;
Kizenko, said. &#8220;Now I can finish building up a Russian banya in
New Jersey.&#8221; He didn&#8217;t rule out a return to the financial
industry at a later date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Banya Tradition &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banya tradition dates to the 11th century in Russia. A
wooden log shed is heated by an electric or wood-burning stove
to more than 80 degrees Celsius (176 degrees Fahrenheit). Copious
amounts of water are poured on the heat source to bring the
humidity to about the same level. A visit to a banya begins with
several rotations in and out of the steam room to allow the body
to warm up. Naked bathers typically beat one another with birch
or pine branches before plunging into cold water or rolling in
snow to cool down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are about five to seven banyas already in the New
York, area according to Kizenko, who considered opening one in
London until he saw how expensive the rents are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are a few in Brooklyn and Manhattan, but the
aesthetics are not up to scratch,&#8221; Kizenko said by phone today.
&#8220;We are going for a mixture of the contemporary and the
classical of Sanduny in Moscow.&#8221; Kizenko had his banya, called
Bear and Birch, made in Russia and shipped to the U.S., he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Built in the 19th century for nobles, the Sanduny baths
near the Kremlin are Moscow&#8217;s fanciest. The poet Alexander Pushkin and the writer Leo Tolstoy are said to have bathed
there. More recent visitors include the actors John Travolta,
Dolph Lundgren and the billionaire Roman Abramovich. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs reduced its compensation and benefits expense
21 percent to $12.2 billion in 2011 as revenue slid 26 percent.
The expense for salary, bonuses and benefits, the company&#8217;s
biggest cost, was enough to provide $367,057 to each of its
33,300 employees, down from $430,700 for each of its 35,700
workers at the end of 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, the firm said today Paolo Zannoni, chairman of
Italian investment banking, will take over as chief of Russian
operations from co-heads Chris Barter and Jean Raby in the third
leadership change in as many years. Barter is leaving Goldman
after 19 years to start his own investment firm while Raby will
remain and work with investment-banking clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Jason Corcoran" date="Feb 01, 2012 11:29 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-01/goldman-sachs-names-italy-chairman-zannoni-head-of-moscow-office.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Names Italy Chairman Zannoni Head of Russia</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said Paolo Zannoni, chairman of Italian investment banking, will take over
as chief of Russian operations from co-heads Chris Barter and
Jean Raby in the third leadership change in as many years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barter, who joined the Moscow office in 2007, will retire
after 19 years while Raby will work with investment-banking
clients, the New York-based firm said in a statement today.
Massimo Della Ragione and Francesco Pascuzzi will continue as
co-heads of investment banking in Italy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank, led by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein,
has struggled after opening its first office in Moscow in 1994.
It scaled back soon after as part of a worldwide retrenchment,
returned in 1998 weeks before Russia defaulted, withdrew almost
entirely after the crisis and ramped up again in 2006. The firm
has since then more than tripled its Moscow workforce to 150. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The old perception of Goldman Sachs in Russia is that we
haven&#8217;t been consistent in our efforts in this country,&#8221; Barter
said in an interview May 12. &#8220;This is not the reality today.&#8221;
Barter was named sole head in January 2010 after sharing the job
with David Schwimmer. A year later, Raby was named co-head. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barter is quitting to set up an investment firm with two
former colleagues, Ed Eisler and Sam Wisnia, City A.M. reported
today, without saying where it got the information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rankings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs tumbled to 16th place in the rankings of
advisers on Russia mergers and acquisitions last year from
second spot in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The bank didn&#8217;t rank in domestic Russian equities in 2011 after
coming sixth in 2010, the data show. The firm was the sixth-
placed arranger of foreign debt sales, up from 13th in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein is pushing to win mandates for the Kremlin&#8217;s $30
billion privatization program and, along with executives from
other firms, is advising Russia on how to turn Moscow into a
global financial center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government&#8217;s asset-sale plans have been delayed by the
financial crisis, and Goldman Sachs lost out in December to
Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, BNP Paribas, OAO Sberbank (SBER03) and
VTB Capital to organize the sovereign&#8217;s first foreign bond sale
since 2010. VTB and Sberbank, Russia&#8217;s two largest lenders, are
also boosting their investment banking business and are eating
into market share of domestic and foreign competitors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rajat Gupta, the former Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) director accused of giving inside information to fund
manager Raj Rajaratnam, faces new allegations he passed tips
about earnings of Goldman Sachs in 2007 and Procter  Gamble Co. (PG)
in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a superseding indictment filed yesterday in federal
court in Manhattan, the U.S. broadened its description of the
insider-trading scheme, saying it began in March 2007 not in
2008 as alleged in October. Prosecutors also said Gupta tipped
Galleon Group LLC co-founder Rajaratnam about Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
first quarter 2007 earnings and while at Galleon&#8217;s offices
listened to a Goldman Sachs board meeting where earnings were
disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;During that call, the audit committee discussed the
company&#8217;s quarterly earnings announcement that would be made the
following day,&#8221; assistant U.S. attorneys Reed Brodsky and
Richard Tarlowe said in the indictment. &#8220;Gupta participated in
the audit committee call from the premises of Galleon.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta, 63, who also led McKinsey  Co. and was a PG
director, was accused in October of passing inside information
to Rajaratnam from 2008 to January 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. said yesterday Gupta&#8217;s investments with
Rajaratnam, which included $10 million invested in funds and an
ownership stake in at least two other funds, were a motive for
him to engage in the insider-trading scheme. Gupta made a
commitment to invest about $22.5 million in a private-equity
fund focusing on Asia, the U.S. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an e-mailed statement, Gupta&#8217;s lawyer, Gary Naftalis,
called the government&#8217;s allegations &#8220;totally baseless&#8221; and
said that his client &#8220;did not trade in any securities, did not
tip Mr. Rajaratnam so he could trade, and did not share in any
profits as part of any quid pro quo.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The newly added charges -- like the ones brought last
year -- are not based on any direct evidence, but rely on
supposed circumstantial evidence,&#8221; Naftalis said. &#8220;The facts
in this case demonstrate that Mr. Gupta is innocent of all of
these charges, and that he has always acted with honesty and
integrity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, who was convicted by a jury last year, is
serving an 11-year prison term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Gupta, 11-cr-00907, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;BP Must Cover Some Halliburton Gulf Spill Costs, Judge Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP (BP/) Plc must cover some of any direct damage claims awarded
against Halliburton Co. (HAL) for the $40 billion in cleanup costs and
economic losses caused by the 2010 oil-well blowout and Gulf of
Mexico spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP must indemnify Halliburton for compensatory damage
claims under its drilling contract, U.S. District Judge Carl
Barbier in New Orleans ruled yesterday. London-based BP sued
Halliburton, which provided cementing services for the project,
in April to recover a share of any damages and costs from the
spill. Any punitive damages awarded against Halliburton don&#8217;t
have to be paid by BP, the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;BP is required to indemnify Halliburton for third-party
compensatory claims that arise from pollution or contamination
that did not originate from the property or equipment of
Halliburton located above the surface of the land or water, even
if Halliburton&#8217;s gross negligence caused the pollution,&#8221;
Barbier wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any civil penalties under the Clean Water Act against
Houston-based Halliburton also won&#8217;t have to be covered by BP,
Barbier said. The judge said he wouldn&#8217;t express an opinion on
whether Halliburton would be held liable for punitive damages or
Clean Water Act fines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barbier has scheduled a nonjury trial to begin Feb. 27 to
determine fault for the explosion. Trials to determine damages
haven&#8217;t been scheduled yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s decision follows an earlier ruling that BP must
indemnify Transocean Ltd. (RIG), owner of the Deepwater Horizon rig
that exploded and sank. The Transocean ruling also didn&#8217;t cover
fines or punitive damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barbier said he wouldn&#8217;t rule yet on BP&#8217;s claim that
Halliburton committed fraud by concealing material information
about the cement tests it conducted. A ruling against
Halliburton on this issue may put the company back on the hook
for damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Fraud could void an indemnity clause on public policy
grounds, given that it necessarily includes intentional
wrongdoing,&#8221; Barbier said. &#8220;There are material issues of fact
that preclude summary judgment on this issue.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two indemnity rulings &#8220;should put an end to the
attempts by Transocean and Halliburton to avoid their
obligations,&#8221; BP said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Halliburton is, at a minimum, responsible for any
punitive damages as well as civil penalties to the extent that
they may apply under the Clean Water Act,&#8221; BP said. &#8220;Moreover,
the court determined that if Halliburton is found to have
committed fraud, then the indemnity could be void.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Halliburton agrees with the ruling to the extent that it
requires BP to honor its contractual indemnity obligations,&#8221;
Beverly Stafford, a spokeswoman for Halliburton, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The April 2010 Macondo well blowout and the explosion that
followed killed 11 workers and set off the worst offshore oil
spill in U.S. history. The sinking of Transocean&#8217;s Deepwater
Horizon drilling rig and the spill led to hundreds of lawsuits
against BP and its partners and contractors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Oil Spill by the Oil Rig Deepwater
Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010, MDL-2179, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tainted-Well Lawsuits Mount Against Gas Frackers Led by Cabot &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 36 years, Norma Fiorentino drew water from a well near
her home in Dimock, Pennsylvania. &#8220;It was the best water in
town,&#8221; she says. Then on Jan. 1, 2009, she says her well blew
up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State regulators later blamed natural gas drilling by Cabot
Oil  Gas Corp. (COG) for elevating methane levels in Dimock wells.
Fiorentino and her neighbors sued, alleging Cabot&#8217;s activities
caused contamination and, in Fiorentino&#8217;s case, an explosion
that cracked a concrete cap into three pieces. Cabot has denied
responsibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dimock case, in federal court in Scranton,
Pennsylvania, is among a batch of claims that aim to put
hydraulic fracturing, the process that injects a mix of water,
sand and chemicals underground to free gas trapped there, on
trial, Bloomberg News&#8217; Jim Snyder reports. The suits could lead
to payouts to plaintiffs and stricter government regulations,
raising costs on an industry President Barack Obama says can
boost the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The plaintiffs bar is always looking for the next big
thing,&#8221; said Jennifer Quinn-Barabanov, a partner at Washington-based Steptoe  Johnson LLP, which has represented oil and gas
companies. &#8220;There were a number of lawsuits filed, and now
everyone is kind of waiting and seeing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stuart Smith, a New Orleans-based plaintiffs&#8217; attorney,
said the number of cases will increase as fracking expands into
more populated areas and complaints grow. More drilling may also
create new routes for the chemicals to migrate, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least 23 cases involving fracking have been filed since
August 2009 by landowners from Arkansas to New York, according
to an analysis by Fulbright  Jaworski LLP, a Houston-based
firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides Cabot, Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) and Southwestern
Energy Co. (SWN) have faced lawsuits claiming harm, according to the
summary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dimock case is Fiorentino v. Cabot Oil  Gas Corp., 09-02284, U.S. District Court for the Middle District of
Pennsylvania (Scranton). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hewlett-Packard Wins Dismissal of Oracle Fraud Claim Over Hurd &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) won dismissal of Oracle Corp. (ORCL)&#8217;s claim
that it was duped into settling a dispute over its hiring of
HP&#8217;s former chief executive officer, Mark Hurd,. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle alleged that HP fraudulently hid that it was
planning to hire Leo Apotheker as CEO and board chairman Ray
Lane, who were &#8220;toxic&#8221; to any partnership with Oracle, when it
forged a settlement with Oracle over its hiring of Hurd. Oracle
also claimed that HP concealed that it was secretly paying Intel
Corp. (INTC) $88 million a year to &#8220;artificially continue&#8221; the
Itanium chip&#8217;s lifespan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A state judge in San Jose, California, said in a ruling
Jan. 30 that HP&#8217;s alleged misrepresentations &#8220;did not prevent
Oracle from participating in the negotiations&#8221; over the Hurd
settlement  &#8220;or deprive Oracle of the opportunity to
negotiate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge James Kleinberg also rejected bids by both companies
to seal documents in the case that they argued contain sensitive
business information that that might harm them or their
customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HP said yesterday in an e-mailed statement that the fraud
claim dismissed by the court &#8220;was another attempt by Oracle to
get out of the contract it entered into with HP, wherein it
continued to offer its product suite on HP&#8217;s server platform.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle said in an e-mailed statement that it&#8217;s pleased with
the judge&#8217;s refusal to seal HP documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court &#8220;has rejected HP&#8217;s attempt to hide the truth
about Itanium&#8217;s certain end of life from its customers, partners
and own employees,&#8221; Oracle said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deborah Hellinger, a spokeswoman for Redwood City,
California-based Oracle, declined to comment on the dismissal of
the fraud claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Oracle Corp., 11-cv-203163, California Superior Court, Santa Clara County. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;EchoStar Loses Appeal of Sanctions for E-Mail Destruction &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A New York State appeals court affirmed a decision to
impose sanctions on EchoStar (SATS) Satellite LLC for destroying e-mail
evidence in a Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC) contract suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Manhattan court yesterday upheld a decision by the
trial judge, Richard Lowe. The judge found in November 2010 that
EchoStar &#8220;systematically destroyed evidence in direct violation
of the law.&#8221; He said he will tell jurors that the company did
so and that the jury may assume the evidence would have been
helpful to the plaintiffs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sanction was &#8220;appropriate and proportionate,&#8221; Judge
Sallie Manzanet-Daniels wrote in a unanimous appeals court
opinion on the suit by Cablevision&#8217;s Voom HD Holdings unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Although Voom may have other evidence to point to, the
missing evidence is from a crucial time period during which
EchoStar appears to have been searching for a way out of its
contract,&#8221; Manzanet-Daniels wrote. &#8220;Evidence from this vital
time period is not entirely duplicative of other evidence.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voom sued in 2008, accusing EchoStar of breaching a
distribution agreement that called for Voom to provide 21 high-definition television channels to EchoStar, which at the time
operated the Dish satellite-television network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Today&#8217;s ruling confirms that EchoStar destroyed evidence
in blatant violation of the law and will now be held accountable
for its misconduct,&#8221; Orin Snyder, an attorney representing
Cablevision, wrote in an e-mail. &#8220;We look forward to trial.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roy Reardon, an attorney representing EchoStar, didn&#8217;t
return a phone message left at his office seeking comment on
whether the decision will be appealed to the state&#8217;s highest
court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deepak Dutt, a spokesman for EchoStar, had no immediate
comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Voom HD Holdings LLC v. EchoStar Satellite LLC,
600292/2008, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New Suits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DZ Bank Sues JPMorgan and HSBC Over Mortgage Securities &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DZ Bank AG sued JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA),
accusing the banks of making false and misleading statements in
connection with the sale of residential mortgage-backed
securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DZ Bank, Germany&#8217;s largest cooperative lender, sued
JPMorgan in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan Jan. 30,
saying it bought about $85 million of the securities based on
flawed offering materials. DZ Bank filed a similar suit
yesterday against HSBC, Europe&#8217;s biggest bank, in the same
court, over $122 million worth of the investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Plaintiff did not know the true facts regarding
defendants&#8217; misrepresentations and omissions in the offering
materials, and justifiably relied on those misrepresentations
and omissions,&#8221; Frankfurt-based DZ Bank said in court
documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
biggest recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
and the crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the
market for the securities evaporated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tasha Pelio, a spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment on DZ Bank&#8217;s lawsuit. Neil Brazil, a
spokesman for London-based HSBC, said the company doesn&#8217;t
comment on pending litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan case is Deutsche Zentral-Genossenschaftsbank
AG v. JPMorgan Chase  Co, 650293/2012, New York State Supreme
Court (Manhattan). The HSBC case is Deutsche Zentral-Genossenschaftsbank  AG v. HSBC North America Holdings Inc.,
650303/2012, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cameron Sues Insurer Over Refusal It Says Threatened BP Deal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameron International Corp. (CAM), facing thousands of claims
from the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, sued one of its insurers
for allegedly refusing to pay $50 million in coverage, a move
the manufacturer says threatened a $250 million settlement with
BP Plc. (BP) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameron, in a complaint filed Jan. 30 in federal court in
New Orleans, accused a Liberty Mutual Holding Co. unit of breach
of contract and of acting in bad faith by holding the settlement
with BP &#8220;hostage&#8221; so the insurer could negotiate a &#8220;steep
discount&#8221; on the amount it owed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When Cameron needed it the most, Liberty refused to
provide Cameron the $50 million in insurance limits it sold
Cameron,&#8221; according to the complaint. &#8220;Instead, Liberty
offered Cameron a choice: either continue the Gulf oil spill
litigation and face potentially crippling liability, or agree to
accept much less than what Liberty was contractually obligated
to pay under its insurance policy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameron, which said it paid the $50 million from its own
funds, seeks a court order requiring Liberty Insurance
Underwriters to indemnify it for that amount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameron said it has now paid $250 million to BP. The
settlement proceeds are to be contributed by BP into a fund for
the victims of the spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameron manufactured the blow-out preventer, the subsea
device that failed to stop the BP well explosion on April 20,
2010, that killed 11 workers aboard the Deepwater Horizon oil
rig. The rig burned and sank, triggering the worst offshore oil
spill in U.S. history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adrianne Kaufmann, a Liberty spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t return a
phone call after regular business hours Jan. 30 seeking comment
on the lawsuit. Rhonda Barnat, a spokeswoman for Houston-based
Cameron, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Cameron International Corp. v. Liberty
Insurance Underwriters, 2:12-cv-0311, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of Louisiana (New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Micromet Investor Calls Amgen&#8217;s $1 Billion Bid Too Low &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Micromet Inc. was sued by a shareholder who said Amgen
Inc. (AMGN)&#8217;s $1 billion takeover offer for the drugmaker undervalues
his stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Micromet&#8217;s board failed in its duty to get the best price,
the investor, Bernard Passes, said in a complaint filed Jan. 30
in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington. Amgen, based in
Thousand Oaks, California, announced a deal on Jan. 26 to buy
Micromet for $11 a share to gain an experimental leukemia drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given the company&#8217;s growth prospects and potential for
significant income,&#8221; the transaction is inadequate, Passes said
in his complaint. He said Micromet stock is worth at least $12 a
share &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Neiman, a spokeswoman for Rockville, Maryland-based Micromet, declined to comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Passes v. Micromet, CA7198, Delaware Chancery
Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Stanford World&#8217; Built With Investors&#8217; Funds, Prosecutor Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A $330 million promissory note signed by R. Allen Stanford
was introduced at his criminal trial as evidence that the
financier secretly borrowed money from his bank to build a
lavish &#8220;Stanford World in Antigua&#8221; and lure rich new clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Rich people do not get impressed very easily,&#8221; Stanford
said in an undated video clip shown to his jury yesterday in
Houston federal court. &#8220;They have to go back literally blown
away, saying &#8216;I have a confidence and a trust that I will do
business in that part of the world.&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford, videotaped while speaking to a gathering in
Antigua, said his goal in building the private airplane hangar,
restaurants, cricket grounds and banking facilities on 20 acres
surrounding Stanford International Bank Ltd. was to convince the
&#8220;richest people in the world&#8221; it was safe to invest there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford, 61, was indicted in June 2009 on charges he led a
$7 billion investment fraud based on certificates of deposit
issued by the Antiguan bank. He&#8217;s accused of 14 counts including
mail fraud, wire fraud and obstruction of a probe by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. He denies the allegations.
If convicted on the most serious charges, he could be imprisoned
for 20 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant U.S. Attorney Gregg Costa asked government
witness Arnold Knoche, a former president of Stanford
Development Corp., if he knew where the money came from for
&#8220;Stanford World in Antigua.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He told me he had his personal resources, that he&#8217;d take
care of it,&#8221; Knoche testified in the second week of trial. &#8220;I
always wondered where the money was coming from because it was a
huge amount.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knoche testified that Stanford never said he used
depositors&#8217; funds on real estate developments in the Caribbean
or elsewhere. He also said he never suspected illegal activity
during his 16 years with Stanford&#8217;s organization. Knoche said he
resigned in 2003 because he was tired of the constant travel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. Stanford, 09-cr-342, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston). The SEC
case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Stanford
International Bank, 09-cv-298, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of Texas (Dallas). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Commerzbank CEO Testifies He Wanted Loyalty Not Bonus Demands &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commerzbank AG (CBK) Chief Executive Officer Martin Blessing said
bankers whose bonuses were cut after the German lender&#8217;s buyout
of Dresdner Bank would have accepted it if they were motivated
by loyalty rather than money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 100 bankers are suing Commerzbank in the U.K. for
cutting bonuses by 90 percent or more following the takeover of
Dresdner in 2009. Stefan Jentzsch, then-CEO of Dresdner, had
promised to set aside 400 million euros ($523 million) for the
awards the previous year, the bankers claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his final day of witness testimony, Blessing said he
believed employees would &#8220;understand the circumstances we were
in&#8221; and say to themselves, &#8220;I&#8217;m not working here only for
money. I also have loyalty.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commerzbank argues it was reasonable to reduce
discretionary pay following a record loss by Dresdner&#8217;s
investment-banking unit in 2008. Blessing, who oversaw
Commerzbank&#8217;s January 2009 acquisition of Dresdner and its 18.2
billion-euro bailout during the credit crunch, said during two
days of testimony he had to consider the interests of other
employees, shareholders and the general public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 104 bankers, who are seeking individual payouts of as
much as 2 million euros, claim Jentzsch&#8217;s pledge is a binding
legal commitment that Commerzbank must honor. Jentzsch, now a
partner at Perella Weinberg Partners LP&#8217;s U.K. unit, is
scheduled to appear later in the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases include: Mr. Fahmi Anar  Others v. Dresdner
Kleinwort Ltd., Commerzbank AG, High Court of Justice, Queen&#8217;s
Bench Division, HQ09X05230 and Richard Attrill  71 others v.
Dresdner Kleinwort Limited, Commerzbank  AG, HQ09X04007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ex-FrontPoint Manager Skowron Calls Morgan Stanley No Victim &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former FrontPoint Partners LLC fund manager Joseph F.
&#8220;Chip&#8221; Skowron, sentenced to five years in prison for an
insider-trading scheme, says that Morgan Stanley (MS) isn&#8217;t a victim
of his crimes and doesn&#8217;t deserve restitution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skowron, 42, who began serving his term at the Federal
Correctional Institution Schuylkill in Pennsylvania last month,
said that Morgan Stanley shouldn&#8217;t collect any funds under the
Mandatory Victims Restitution Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He pleaded guilty to getting illegal tips from a former
adviser for Human Genome Sciences Inc. that trials of the
company&#8217;s hepatitis C drug were being halted. FrontPoint sold
its stock before the announcement was made public, avoiding $30
million in losses, the U.S. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, which acquired FrontPoint in 2006 and spun
it off in February, has submitted the largest restitution
request to the court, saying it should be paid $37.4 million
after sustaining &#8220;very substantial damages&#8221; as a result of
Skowron&#8217;s conduct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skowron&#8217;s lawyer, Joshua Epstein, disputed Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
assertion Jan. 30 in a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Morgan Stanley is not a victim,&#8221; he said, &#8220;because its
purported losses were not directly and proximately caused by the
conduct underlying the offense of conviction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt Burkhard, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley, declined to
comment on the filing. Peter White, a lawyer for FrontPoint,
didn&#8217;t return a call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Skowron, 11-cr-699, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JC Flowers Ex-U.K. Chief Won&#8217;t Be Investigated by London Police &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London police chose not to investigate JC Flowers  Co.&#8217;s
former U.K. chief executive officer after regulators fined him
for faking invoices to take money from a company the private
equity firm invested in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;City of London Police didn&#8217;t open a formal probe after JC
Flowers declined to assist an informal inquiry and told them
there was no actual victim in light of its reimbursement of the
company&#8217;s losses, according to two people familiar with the
matter who asked not to be identified because they weren&#8217;t
authorized to speak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. finance regulator yesterday fined Ravi Shankar
Sinha, JC Flowers&#8217;s former U.K. chief executive, 2.87 million
pounds ($4.5 million) and banned him from working in finance in
the country. Sinha defrauded a company in which New York-based
JC Flowers invested 1.37 million pounds by submitting falsified
invoices, lying to the company CEO and saying the firm had
authorized him to charge advisory fees, the FSA said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The public will have difficulty understanding why it is a
checkout girl who steals 10,000 pounds from her employer who
should go to prison but a phenomenally wealthy individual who
steals millions should not,&#8221; said Sara George, a regulatory
lawyer at the London-based law firm Stephenson Harwood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JC Flowers told the police that, given their reimbursement
of the unidentified company&#8217;s losses, there was no victim that
had suffered and there was no reason to prosecute when the
Financial Services Authority was handling the matter, the people
said. The private equity firm had reported the incident to the
FSA and cooperated with the civil investigation, the regulator
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Had the police chosen to launch a criminal investigation,
then JC Flowers would have cooperated fully, and indeed would
today cooperate with any investigation should the police decide
to mount an inquiry,&#8221; Michael Harrison, an outside spokesman
for the firm at Brunswick Group, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The City of London Police said in a statement that it
received details of the case from the FSA and, after discussions
with the affected company, decided not to prosecute Sinha.
Because the police never opened a formal probe, JC Flowers
didn&#8217;t obstruct an investigation, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FSA spokesman Joseph Eyre declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sinha committed the fraud because of his deteriorating
finances, the FSA said. Between May and July 2008, Sinha
borrowed around 9 million euros ($11.9 million) to invest in
companies in which JC Flowers funds had invested. The funds&#8217;
performance declined, and he was left unable to pay his debt,
the regulator said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSA &#8220;has made it clear that it makes no criticism of
JC Flowers&#8217; systems and controls,&#8221; the firm said in a
statement. The firm fired Sinha in 2009 after it discovered the
fake invoices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Second Trial in Foreign Bribe Sting Case Ends With Hung Jury &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second trial in the biggest U.S. prosecution of
individuals accused of foreign bribery ended with acquittals and
a hung jury. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Richard Leon in Washington yesterday
declared a mistrial after jurors said they couldn&#8217;t agree on
charges alleging three security industry executives planned to
make payments to a federal agent posing as a representative of
the west African country of Gabon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling came one day after the same jury acquitted two
others in the case, including a former deputy assistant director
of the U.S. Secret Service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three remaining defendants in the trial were John
Mushriqui and his sister, Jeana Mushriqui, and Marc Morales.
Each was charged with two to three counts of violating the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which has a maximum penalty of
five years in prison. They pleaded not guilty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laura Sweeney, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said she
couldn&#8217;t immediately comment on the ruling or whether
prosecutors plan to retry Morales and the Mushriquis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the three defendants didn&#8217;t immediately return
e-mail messages seeking comment on the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial, which opened Sept. 28, was the second in a 22-defendant kickback conspiracy case stemming from a fake $15
million weapons deal. A trial of four others arrested in the
sting ended in a mistrial in July after a jury failed to agree
on a verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Goncalves, 09-cr-00335, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM Reaches $23.8 Million Pollution Settlement With U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Motors Corp. (GM) agreed to pay as much as $23.8 million
to settle liability for environmental cleanup costs in New
Jersey, Maryland and Missouri, the U.S. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement resolves Detroit-based GM&#8217;s pre-bankruptcy
liability for U.S. claims filed under the federal Superfund
statute, according to a statement yesterday by the office of
U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan. Under the settlement,
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will receive allowed
claims of $20.9 million in GM&#8217;s bankruptcy proceeding, plus
$2.89 million of cleanup work at the sites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM, which filed for bankruptcy in June 2009, sold assets to
a new company that went public as General Motors Co. The allowed
bankruptcy claim will be paid in stock and warrants of &#8220;New
GM.&#8221; The cash value of the allowed claim probably will be less
than $20.9 million, the U.S. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three polluted sites covered by the agreement include
the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site, which comprises parts of the
Passaic and Hackensack Rivers, Newark Bay, the Arthur Kill and
the Kill Van Kull in New Jersey. Also covered are the Kane 
Lombard Superfund Site in Baltimore County, Maryland, and the
Hayford Bridge Superfund Site in St. Charles, Missouri. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Motors Liquidation Co., 09-50026, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Litigation Departments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Facebook Lawyers Want &#8216;Stratospheric&#8217; Fee, Ceglia Claims &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Ceglia, who was fined for failing to turn over
evidence in his ownership suit against Facebook Inc. (FB), said he
shouldn&#8217;t also have to reimburse the company for
&#8220;stratospheric&#8221; legal fees of as much as $716 an hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Magistrate Judge Leslie Foschio on Jan. 10 fined
Ceglia $5,000 after ruling the New York man had ignored a court
order requiring him to give Facebook access to his e-mail
accounts. The judge also ordered Ceglia to reimburse the company
for the legal fees it incurred in pursuing the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ceglia&#8217;s lawyer, Dean Boland of Lakewood, Ohio, objected to
the size of the fees in court papers filed in federal court in
Buffalo, New York, Jan. 30, saying they&#8217;re not justified by the
&#8220;garden-variety&#8221; issues presented by the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the suit, Ceglia claims he has a 2003 contract signed by
Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg that gave him half-ownership
of the company, now worth an estimated $74.3 billion, according
to Sharespost.com, which tracks nonpublic companies. Facebook,
based in Menlo Park, California, operates the most popular
social-networking site in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boland also argued that Facebook&#8217;s lawyers, from Gibson,
Dunn  Crutcher LLP, shouldn&#8217;t charge New York City prices for
Buffalo work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orin Snyder, the lead Gibson Dunn partner on the case, had
a billing rate of $955 an hour in 2011, according to papers
filed by Facebook. Two other Gibson Dunn partners cost their
clients $850 and $825 an hour. They were assisted by two
associates, at $670 and $450 an hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snyder declined to comment on the firm&#8217;s fee request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Ceglia v. Zuckerberg, 1:10-cv-00569, U.S.
District Court, Western District of New York (Buffalo). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;WikiLeaks&#8217;s Assange Sued on Eve of U.K. Extradition Appeal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who will ask the U.K.
Supreme Court today to block his extradition to Sweden in a rape
case, was sued by the British law firm he hired after his 2010
arrest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finers Stephens Innocent LLP, which specializes in
commercial litigation, sued the 40-year-old Australian yesterday
in London over legal fees, according to court records. Assange
replaced the firm last year after a U.K. judge rejected his
defense and upheld the Swedish arrest warrant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s always regrettable when we find ourselves in a
dispute with a former client about fees,&#8221; Tim Bignell, a lawyer
at the firm, said in a phone interview. &#8220;We tried to resolve
this amicably with Mr. Assange and we still hope to be able
to.&#8221; He didn&#8217;t say how much the firm is owed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assange, now represented by human-rights lawyer Gareth
Peirce, denies the rape claims by two supporters of the anti-secrecy website who let him stay at their homes in 2010. Assange
argues Sweden&#8217;s arrest warrant is invalid because the prosecutor
who issued it isn&#8217;t a &#8220;judicial authority,&#8221; as required under
European Union law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peirce didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a message seeking
comment about the lawsuit over fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assange, who hasn&#8217;t been charged with a crime, is accused
of failing to use a condom with one of the Swedish women and
having sex with the other while she was asleep. The claims
became public around the same time Assange was condemned by U.S.
officials for posting classified military and diplomatic cables
on the WikiLeaks website and he claimed the case was politically
motivated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
may cut as many as 8,000 jobs from a total of 20,000 positions
in Germany, Handelsblatt reported, citing unidentified people
from the company&#8217;s local board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s German division, which generates about 5 billion
euros ($6.5 billion) in annual sales, missed targets set by
headquarters, the German newspaper said. IBM&#8217;s management team
is working on a reorganization which includes contracting out
some tasks, Handelsblatt reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embotelladora Andina SA (AKO/A), Chile&#8217;s
largest Coca-Cola (KO) bottler, will take over rival Embotelladora
Coca-Cola Polar SA in an all-stock transaction agreed to by the
two companies&#8217; controllers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andina will swap 0.33 new share for each existing Coca-Cola
Polar share, giving the latter&#8217;s shareholders 20 percent of the
combined company, under a memorandum of understanding signed by
the controllers, according to a statement posted on the
securities regulator&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction would create one of Latin America&#8217;s biggest
Coca-Cola bottlers, with operations in Argentina, Brazil, Chile
and Paraguay and sales of $2.56 billion, according to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two companies&#8217; controllers are scheduled to sign a
merger contract by March 15, they said in the statement. The
transaction is subject to regulatory approval. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the cafeteria of Hurley Medical
Center, in Flint, Michigan, a doctor walks up to the steam trays
at the Cafe Spice kiosk, takes a spoon, and flicks two grains of
rice pulao into his mouth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He chews for several seconds, then walks to the other side
of the counter and samples another batch. After careful
deliberation, the doctor forgets the rice, takes two naan
breads, douses his plate with mint chutney, and sits at a table
with his colleagues -- doctors from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh,
and Nepal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of them have been eating curries, biryanis, and other
Indian staples every day for lunch and dinner since the Cafe
Spice kiosk opened here last summer, Bloomberg Businessweek
reports in its Feb. 6 issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Before, we were eating a lot of mac and cheese,&#8221; groans
Dr. Rao Mushtaq, a general practitioner originally from
Pakistan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My first year here my cholesterol shot up dangerously
high,&#8221; Dr. Vishwas Vaniawala, an Indian pediatrician, says.
&#8220;Honestly, I used to skip lunches because I was sick of eating
salads and sandwiches and chips.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The South Asian doctors, who, as at many U.S. teaching
hospitals, make up the majority of residents at Hurley,
eventually demanded more familiar food from Steve Dunn, the
cafeteria&#8217;s executive chef. While Dunn, an employee of the
French catering company Sodexo (SW), had never even tasted Indian
food, he made samosas, saag paneer, and chickpea masala from
scratch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not Uncle Ben&#8217;s &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t do it every day,&#8221; he says, even though
doctors responded enthusiastically.  &#8220;I mean, it takes a hell
of a lot of time and knowledge. It took my staff three weeks to
learn how to make basmati rice, because they were used to Uncle
Ben&#8217;s.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Dunn turned to Cafe Spice, America&#8217;s largest Indian
food-service company, which has a branded partnership with
Sodexo, an Issy-les-Moulineaux, France-based company. Each month
he receives a shipment of frozen Indian dishes that his staff
heats and serves in a kiosk designed and installed by Cafe
Spice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#8217;s happening in Flint is spreading across the nation as
Cafe Spice owners Sushil Malhotra and his son Sameer place their
curries in supermarkets, hospitals, colleges, and corporate
cafeterias. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goldman, Morgan Stanley &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cafe Spice&#8217;s 17 current locations include Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, New York University, and the New York
headquarters of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan Stanley. (MS) The
company&#8217;s food is sold without the brand name in another 400
cafeterias and in more than 250 Whole Foods Market Inc. (WFM) stores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past year, Cafe Spice&#8217;s revenue grew 40 percent, to
about $20 million. While that&#8217;s tiny compared with sales at a
food giant like McDonald&#8217;s Corp., which moves $20&#160;million worth
of product about every six-and-a-half hours, should Cafe Spice&#8217;s
expansion continue, Sushil Malhotra may fulfill a dream he&#8217;s had
for 40 years: To make his beloved Indian cuisine mainstream in
the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It could be as big as the sushi invasion,&#8221; he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malhotra, 63, moved to New York from Bombay in 1966 to
study engineering at City College, and later worked at Shell Oil
and American Electric Power Co. (AEP) In 1970 he and his father opened
a spice trading shop, supplying New York&#8217;s curry houses with
spices, chutneys, and papadums. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Indian Fine Dining &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he and his wife, Lata, had American friends over to
their house for dinner, the guests would ask him why they
couldn&#8217;t get food this simple and fresh at Indian restaurants
around town. Neighborhood Indian restaurants, their decor
inevitably designed to evoke the Taj Mahal, tend to serve
identical menus, often from a buffet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There was, and is, no professionalism to these places,&#8221;
Sushil says in his Irvington, New York, living room, which has
carved elephants, heaps of embroidered cushions, and a formal
waiter serving onion bhaji. &#8220;They bastardized the food.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To showcase Indian cooking, Sushil opened a fine-dining
restaurant in Manhattan called Akbar in 1976, and another,
Dawat, eight years later. He brought in cookbook author Madhur
Jaffrey -- the Julia Child of Indian food -- to design the menu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Dawat was a critical and financial success, Sushil
wanted to emulate what was happening in the U.K., where curry
was supplanting fish and chips as the national food. He dabbled
in other mass-market concepts, including a takeout spot called
Curry in a Hurry, before opening Cafe Spice near NYU in 1998. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Grand Central &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The restaurant, since sold, was revolutionary in its design
and simplicity: a modern Indian bistro, priced between the
greasy buffets and Dawat. A year later the company opened its
first Cafe Spice Express in Grand Central Terminal. Sushil soon
saw the potential to put these quick-serve counters where Indian
restaurants had never ventured. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sushil&#8217;s at the cutting edge of getting the message
out,&#8221; says restaurateur Drew Nieporent, who changed the image
of Japanese food in America with his Manhattan restaurant Nobu.
&#8220;By bringing Indian food to supermarkets and cafeterias,
Sushil&#8217;s also made it more acceptable and accessible.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American taste buds have proven resistant to curry&#8217;s
charms. There may be more than one reason. Indian isn&#8217;t the
prettiest of cuisines: A tray of chickpea curry doesn&#8217;t have the
same visual appeal as, say, a California roll. Fairly or not,
Americans also seem to associate it with indigestion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 2011 survey of chefs by the National Restaurant
Association, the No. 1 hot gastronomic trend is &#8220;locally
sourced meats and seafood.&#8221; Indian food ranked No. 173, between
absinthe and kimchi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bharath M. Josiam, an Indian-born professor of hospitality
management at the University of North Texas, is confident,
however, that a change in attitudes is underway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Mexican Effect &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Indian food is now very much in sync with major trends in
American food,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Thanks to the proliferation of
authentic Mexican restaurants and products, Americans are
consuming a greater variety of spices and are more willing to
try new foods.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brad Edmondson, a demographics consultant based in Ithaca,
New York, explains why he thinks Indian food will finally hit it
big in a video recently posted on the website of the Private
Label Manufacturers Association. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ethnic food is successful when immigration combines with
international travel and restaurants to create a buzz loud
enough for food manufacturers to hear,&#8221; Edmondson says, holding
up a plate of samosas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cultural exposure has directly affected America&#8217;s
taste for Indian food. According to research provided by the
Mintel Group, 13 percent of U.S. consumers surveyed in 2010
prepared Indian meals in their homes at least once a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More Like &#8216;England&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sukhi Singh, founder of Bay Area-based Sukhi&#8217;s Gourmet
Indian Foods, Cafe Spice&#8217;s main competitor, says her company
recently introduced its frozen meals at a Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST)
store in a Hispanic neighborhood of Los Angeles. She&#8217;s delighted
with the results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s barriers in any places now,&#8221; Singh
adds. &#8220;It&#8217;s kind of snowballing, and, say, maybe in 10 years,
it&#8217;ll be like it is in England.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cafe Spice&#8217;s food is prepared in a 50,000-square-foot
industrial kitchen in New Windsor, New York, just up the Hudson
River from West Point. Inside, more than a hundred workers fold
samosas, fry potato pakoras, grind spices, and stir giant vats
of curry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At the end of the day, I&#8217;m not making one batch for the
University of Massachusetts, one for Goldman Sachs, and one for
Whole Foods,&#8221; says Sameer Malhotra, 33, who runs the day-to-day
business with his wife, Payal. &#8220;It&#8217;s all the same 300-pound
batch, and the Indian grad student at Georgia Tech is getting
the same spice level as someone in Tulsa.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It&#8217;s the Spice &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spice is a delicate issue. It&#8217;s the main reason Americans
will, or won&#8217;t, try Indian food. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If I don&#8217;t spice it enough,&#8221; Sushil says he&#8217;ll get a
call from someone who has been to India who&#8217;ll say &#8220; This isn&#8217;t
a vindaloo! If you say it&#8217;s a vindaloo, it better damn well be
hot.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than lower the heat on its entire menu, Cafe Spice
bases its dishes on four main simmering sauces. Malhotra says
that variety is enough to satisfy 90 percent of diners. To cover
everyone else, the company has installed condiment bars with
chutneys -- the hottest being sriracha-spiked tomato --customers
can add to taste. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ghee-Free &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s one of several adjustments the Malhotras have had to
make to broaden the food&#8217;s appeal and streamline production.
Curries are usually made with ghee, the clarified butter at the
heart of Indian cooking; Cafe Spice is ghee-free. Using
vegetable oil instead is cheaper, meets the low-fat requirements
of Whole Foods, and opens up sales to vegans -- a key
demographic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While traditional Indian restaurants typically bake naan
and roast meats in cylindrical tandoor ovens, the techniques are
difficult to teach and thus too costly to scale. Instead, frozen
naan is imported from Toronto, and the chicken tikka is baked in
a convection oven. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s chefs have begun experimenting with less-
traditional fare, such as naan sandwiches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s catered to the global palate,&#8221; says Payal one
morning in a small office at the processing plant. She&#8217;s taste-
testing sandwiches -- potato with turmeric, chicken tikka, and
crumbled paneer cheese with Monterey Jack. After she picks a
chunk of green chili out of the paneer sandwich, she makes a
note to have the workers chop the chilies into smaller pieces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Entry-Level Naan &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If someone bites into that,&#8221; she frowns, &#8220;they might be
put off our food for a while.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She describes the naan sandwich as Cafe Spice&#8217;s entry-level
item. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To the consumer, it&#8217;s just another flatbread sandwich
with a different filling,&#8221; says Payal. &#8220;People eat it, and
then say, &#8216;This sandwich had chicken tikka in it, and I like
that, so what else is comparable?&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sameer envisions 50 Cafe Spice-branded kiosks in campus and
corporate cafeterias nationwide by 2016. The new locations will
be designed to resemble a market stall, complete with faux-worn
wooden trim. Customers will be able to build plates, bowls, or
sandwiches around base entrees. It&#8217;s like an Indian version of
the Mexican chain Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (CMG) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;ve tried everything,&#8221; says Sushil Malhotra, animating
his words with a flurry of hand gestures. &#8220;This will be my
final project.&#8221; Capturing the American appetite, he feels, is
finally within reach. &#8220;It&#8217;s there, it&#8217;s there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Winning Over Nurses &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Hurley Medical Center cafeteria in Flint, it&#8217;s clear
Cafe Spice has won over Tracy Daviek, a nurse who had never
tried Indian food until Cafe Spice opened this summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I tried it on the first day,&#8221; she says, dipping a piece
of naan into bhindi okra masala. &#8220;My favorite is the chicken,&#8221;
she says, and turns to Steve Dunn. &#8220;You know, the one in the
red sauce?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chicken tikka masala,&#8221; Dunn says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Yeah, and the mango smoothies,&#8221; Daviek says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Lassi,&#8221; Dunn says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another nurse comes and eyes Dunn&#8217;s plate of chicken
vindaloo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Hey Steve,&#8221; she says, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what it is, but I
want a taste of that tomorrow.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Crayton Harrison" date="Feb 02, 2012  4:20 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-02/televisa-may-seek-review-after-1-6-billion-iusacell-phone-deal-blocked.html"><headline>Televisa May Seek Review After $1.6 Billion Iusacell Phone Deal Blocked</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO), the world&#8217;s
largest Spanish-language broadcaster, fell for the 10th time in
11 days after Mexico&#8217;s antitrust agency rejected its $1.6
billion plan to enter the nation&#8217;s mobile-phone market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa dropped 3.9 percent to 50.86 pesos at the close in
Mexico City for the biggest daily slide since Sept. 5. The stock
has declined 6.1 percent since Jan. 25, the day El Universal
newspaper reported the antitrust decision, citing unnamed
sources. That compares to a 1.3 percent gain for Mexico&#8217;s
benchmark IPC index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision by the antitrust agency, known as Cofeco,
prevents Televisa from converting the debt it holds from mobile-
phone carrier Grupo Iusacell SA (CEL*) into shares representing a 50
percent stake. Televisa hasn&#8217;t disclosed whether its agreement
with Iusacell includes a way it could get its money back if the
deal is rejected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is negative news for Televisa, in our view, assuming
that Cofeco&#8217;s decision is upheld following the appeal process,&#8221;
said Gregorio Tomassi, an analyst at Banco Santander SA, today
in a research note. &#8220;Televisa&#8217;s collection rights to the
already disbursed loan are not clear.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3-2 vote by Cofeco to block the merger will hurt
efforts to bring down prices in the mobile-phone business,
Televisa said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. The first step
to overturn the decision may be to ask Cofeco to review its
ruling, Mexico City-based Televisa said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This decision taken by Cofeco damages the potential for
competition in a key sector for Mexico&#8217;s development,&#8221; Televisa
said in the statement. &#8220;The lack of competition has deeply
affected the degree of adoption of these services and the
development of Mexico&#8217;s telecommunications infrastructure.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ruling Review &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A government-commissioned study published by the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development concluded
Mexico&#8217;s phone industry overcharged consumers $13.4 billion a
year between 2005 and 2009. The study called for greater
competition in mobile-phone and high-speed Internet services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Mexican law, companies have 30 business days to ask
the antitrust agency to review a ruling. The agency then has 60
business days to answer the request. An antitrust official who
can&#8217;t be named under the agency&#8217;s policy declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closely held Iusacell&#8217;s debt owned by Televisa has an
interest rate of 2 percent, Televisa said yesterday. The mobile-
phone carrier, which is third in the market behind America Movil
SAB and Telefonica SA (TEF), sought a restructuring plan with
creditors in 2010 for the second time in four years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two antitrust commissioners who voted to allow the deal
affirmed that with a stake in Iusacell, Televisa could improve
competition in the mobile-phone market, Televisa said, citing
the ruling, which Cofeco hasn&#8217;t yet made public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Alliance of Rivals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commissioners also said the antitrust agency could
prevent any negative effects from the transaction by imposing
specific conditions, Televisa said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision was based on &#8220;suspicions and hypothetical
assumptions,&#8221; Mexico City-based Iusacell said in a separate
statement, without providing details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iusacell is owned by billionaire Ricardo Salinas, who also
controls TV Azteca SAB, Televisa&#8217;s chief competitor in Mexico&#8217;s
broadcast television business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alliance would bring the nation&#8217;s two biggest over-the-
air TV networks closer together and could harm competition, said
critics including the Mexican Association for the Right to
Information. Televisa and Salinas&#8217;s group had said they would
continue to compete aggressively in broadcast TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overturning the Decision &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa will eventually succeed in overturning the
decision, Tomas Lajous, an analyst at UBS AG in Mexico City,
said today in a research note. Cofeco commissioners might
reconsider their decision if Televisa and Azteca agree to
conditions to ensure they don&#8217;t collaborate, such as offering
their video programming to other wireless carriers, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America Movil (AMXL) SAB and NII Holdings Inc. (NIHD) asked the antitrust
agency last year to look into whether Televisa and Iusacell had
already cemented the deal without waiting for antitrust
approval, which would be punishable by a fine of as much as 8
percent of each company&#8217;s Mexican sales. The complaints cited
Televisa&#8217;s appointment of at least one board member for Iusacell
and the investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa already has the right to name one of Iusacell&#8217;s
four board members and can add a second when it converts the
wireless carrier&#8217;s debt into shares, the company confirmed last
month. The acquisition of debt isn&#8217;t a transaction that requires
the antitrust agency&#8217;s review, Televisa said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Investigation Open &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The antitrust agency still has an open investigation,
started in December, into agreements between companies in the
mobile-phone and broadcasting businesses. While the agency
hasn&#8217;t said which companies it&#8217;s probing, Televisa and Iusacell
believe they are being targeted, Francisco Borrego, a lawyer for
Iusacell, said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antitrust representatives delivered documents related to
the decision yesterday to Iusacell after a physical
confrontation. Guards punched and shoved antitrust lawyers
trying to enter Iusacell&#8217;s building in Mexico City, according to
a government official who asked not to be named because of the
antitrust agency&#8217;s policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iusacell plans to file a complaint with Mexico&#8217;s attorney
general because of the incident because unidentified people
accompanying the antitrust officials were &#8220;aggressive,&#8221; the
company said in an e-mail yesterday. The company is reviewing
security footage of the incident, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Chris Dolmetsch" date="Feb 02, 2012  3:11 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-02/jpmorgan-sued-over-515-6-million-of-mortgage-backed-securities.html"><headline>JPMorgan Sued by Asset Management Fund Over Securities</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. was sued by
Asset Management Fund over claims it gave faulty information
involving $515.6 million in residential mortgage-backed
securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit, filed in New York state Supreme Court in
Manhattan yesterday, accuses JPMorgan of making &#8220;material
representations and omissions&#8221; regarding underwriting standards
used to make mortgage loans that were pooled into the
securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asset Management Fund, based in Chicago, said it bought the
securities from May 2003 to May 2007, from the defendants, which
also include Bear Stearns  Co. and Washington Mutual Inc. (WAMUQ), both
of which were acquired by JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Plaintiffs did not know the true facts regarding
defendants&#8217; misrepresentations and omissions in the offering
materials, and justifiably relied on those misrepresentations
and omissions,&#8221; lawyers for Asset Management Funds said in
court documents. &#8220;Defendants&#8217; wrongdoing has led directly to
plaintiffs&#8217; damages, which include loss of market value on the
securities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
biggest recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
and the crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the
market for the securities evaporated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Lawsuits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tasha Pelio, a spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment on the lawsuit in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DZ Bank AG, Dexia SA and Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC)&#8217;s John
Hancock Life Insurance unit are among companies that have also
sued JPMorgan over residential mortgage-backed securities in New
York state Supreme Court this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asset Management Fund does business as AMF Funds, according
to court documents. The firm, which is managed by Shay Assets

&lt;p&gt;The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Mexico trading. Stock symbols are in

&lt;p&gt;The IPC index was little changed at 37,705.73. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexican equities were little changed in line with U.S.
stocks as investors await tomorrow&#8217;s U.S. jobs data to gauge the
economic outlook. Mexico sends about 80 percent of its exports
to the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grupo Famsa SAB (GMFAMSAA) (GFAMSAA MM), a Mexican retailer, gained
5.4 percent to 12.69 pesos. Gruma SAB (GRUMAB) , Mexico&#8217;s
largest maker of corn flour for tortillas, gained 1.7 percent to
29.65 pesos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cemex SAB (CEMEXCPO) , the largest cement maker in the
Americas, rose 7.3 percent to 9.76 pesos. The company said its
fourth-quarter loss narrowed to 14 cents per American depositary
receipt today in a statement, beating the average estimate of 17
cents in a survey of eight analysts compiled by Bloomberg. The
company&#8217;s shares rose for a fourth consecutive day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO) , the world&#8217;s largest
Spanish-language broadcaster, fell 3.6 percent to 51.01 pesos.
Televisa fell for the 10th time in 11 days after Mexico&#8217;s
antitrust agency rejected its $1.6 billion plan to enter the
nation&#8217;s mobile-phone market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France&#8217;s National Institute for
Agricultural Research said it signed an agreement with Pfizer
Inc. to boost research cooperation in veterinary medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement will make it easier to set up future
partnerships and research contracts, and includes plans to share
knowledge and expertise, the Paris-based researcher, known by
its acronym INRA, wrote today in an online statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research cooperation could lead to jointly filed and
owned patents, INRA said. The institute said it already works
with Pfizer on finding treatments for bacteria that cause
mammary infections in cows and new ways to treat parasitic
infections in cattle, sheep and goats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This agreement is expected to facilitate cooperation
between the institute and the leading company in veterinary
pharmaceuticals in the framework of future research contracts,&#8221;
INRA said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claire Lauvernier, a Pfizer spokeswoman, confirmed the
cooperation agreement today. She did not provide further
details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;INRA and Pfizer may work together on developing vaccines
and treatments for infectious diseases, knowledge about viruses,
bacteria and parasites that cause illnesses, as well as genetics
and animal immunity, the French researcher wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., conceding
arguments it should recoup losses suffered by fund affiliates on
investments in Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ), will drop a $700
million claim against the bankrupt firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement, filed yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan, ends JPMorgan&#8217;s claim that the affiliates lost the
money on bonds and other investments with Lehman entities, and
have valid claims on the defunct firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the agreement, the funds&#8217; claims will be
reassigned &#8220;free and clear of any adverse claims&#8221; brought by
Lehman, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Rather than litigate the issues,&#8221; Lehman and the funds
&#8220;have agreed to settle their dispute,&#8221; lawyers for Lehman
wrote in the filing. The agreement requires court approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, is receiving the rights to
claims in return and there will be no financial impact on the
company, Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for the New York-based
bank, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimberly Macleod, a Lehman spokeswoman, declined to comment
on the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the funds in December asked the court to
overrule Lehman&#8217;s objection to the claims and allow the funds to
recoup the losses by using some of the $8.6 billion in
collateral that Lehman deposited with the bank before it failed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman argued the funds aren&#8217;t affiliates, &#8220;merely
investment vehicles&#8221; for JPMorgan clients who bore the losses,
and can&#8217;t use the collateral to repay themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history in
2008, listing $613 billion in debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

promoting her as the chief executive officer of the world&#8217;s
largest computer-services provider at the start of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rometty, 54, will receive a salary of $1.5 million this
year, up from $800,000 last year, the Armonk, New York-based
company said today in a regulatory filing. Her cash-incentive
target for 2012 is $3.5 million, compared with $1.47 million she
received for 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rometty become the first female CEO in the company&#8217;s 100-
year history. She inherits a five-year plan that includes
boosting software to half of IBM&#8217;s earnings, with a focus on
programs that help businesses analyze and project trends, as
well as on cloud computing and emerging markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rometty&#8217;s predecessor, Samuel Palmisano, got a bonus of
$6.5 million for 2011, IBM said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM rose 1.1 percent to $193.64 at the close in New York.

&lt;p&gt;Kareem Serageldin, the ex-global head
of Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)&#8217;s CDO business charged in a bonus-
boosting fraud tied to a $5.35 billion trading book, was
surprised by the U.S. indictment since he has been cooperating
with investigators for four years, his lawyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serageldin, 38, a U.S. citizen who lives in England, was
charged in Manhattan federal court for masterminding a scheme to
fake collateralized debt obligation data to meet targets and
protect end-of-year bonuses. Two of his former subordinates,
David Higgs, 42, and Salmaan Siddiqui, 36, pleaded guilty Feb. 1
in New York to manipulating prices at Serageldin&#8217;s direction.
The men were also sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, whose office is
prosecuting the case, urged Serageldin after the indictment was
unsealed to come to the U.S. to face the charges. Serageldin&#8217;s
lawyer said his client was blindsided by Bharara&#8217;s prosecution
because he has been fully cooperating with U.K. and U.S.
investigators, including Bharara. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have been in touch with the government to discuss the
matter,&#8221; James McGuire, a lawyer for Serageldin in New York,
said yesterday in a phone interview. &#8220;He&#8217;s studying his
options.&#8221; Serageldin denied any wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higgs and Siddiqui both implicated their former boss,
saying Serageldin told them to overstate the value of mortgage-
backed assets in a Credit Suisse trading book after the collapse
of the U.S. housing market. Both men, who have plea agreements
with the government, face sentences of as long as five years in
prison on one count of conspiracy, the U.S. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serageldin was charged with conspiracy, falsification of
books and records and wire fraud. While the conspiracy charge
carries a maximum five-year term, the wire fraud and
falsification of books and records counts each carry a term of
as long as 20 years in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We were surprised by the indictment if not the SEC
complaint,&#8221; McGuire said in the interview yesterday. &#8220;We only
learned of this last night for the first time. As you can
imagine, my client is studying the complaint, conferring with
counsel and considering his options.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bharara said at a Feb. 1 news conference announcing the
case that his office didn&#8217;t consider Serageldin a fugitive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Serageldin doesn&#8217;t come to New York, Bharara said the
U.S. will seek to extradite him. Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for
Bharara, declined to comment on McGuire&#8217;s statement about
Serageldin&#8217;s cooperation with the U.S. attorney&#8217;s office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are U.S. v. Higgs, 12-cr-00088, and U.S. v.
Siddiqui, 12-cr-00089, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan). The SEC case is U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission v. Serageldin, 12-cv-00796, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New Suits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Swiss Bank Wegelin Charged With Helping U.S. Clients Evade Taxes &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wegelin  Co., the 270-year-old private bank, became the
first Swiss lender to face criminal charges in a broadening U.S.
crackdown on offshore firms suspected of helping Americans evade
taxes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wegelin helped Americans hide more than $1.2 billion in
assets and evade U.S. taxes, according to an indictment filed
yesterday in federal court in New York. The new charges expand
on earlier ones filed Jan. 3 against three bankers at Wegelin&#8217;s
Zurich branch accused of conspiring to help U.S. clients cheat
on their taxes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said that from 2002 to 2011, more than 100 U.S.
taxpayers conspired with Wegelin, the three Zurich bankers --
Michael Berlinka, Urs Frei and Roger Keller -- and others. The
bank held more than $1.2 billion in assets not declared to the
Internal Revenue Service, according to the indictment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Wegelin Bank aided and abetted U.S. taxpayers who were in
flagrant violation of the tax code,&#8221; Manhattan U.S. Attorney
Preet Bharara said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. and Switzerland are in talks to resolve a U.S.
probe of offshore tax evasion. Wegelin was one of at least 11
banks under criminal investigation by the Justice Department&#8217;s
tax division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wegelin announced on Jan. 27 that it agreed to a sale to
Switzerland&#8217;s Raiffeisen Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal authorities yesterday also seized $16 million in
Wegelin&#8217;s correspondent bank account in the U.S. at UBS AG. (UBSN) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Strassberg, a lawyer who represents the bank in the
U.S., declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said that Wegelin and the three bankers wooed
U.S. clients fleeing UBS, the largest Swiss bank. UBS avoided
U.S. prosecution in 2009 by admitting it aided tax evasion,
paying $780 million and handing over data on 250 accounts. It
later disclosed information on about 4,450 more accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Berlinka, 12-cr-00002, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Sued by Asset Management Fund Over Securities &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. was sued by Asset Management Fund over
claims it gave faulty information involving $515.6 million in
residential mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint, filed in New York state Supreme Court in
Manhattan on Feb. 1, accuses JPMorgan of making &#8220;material
representations and omissions&#8221; regarding underwriting standards
used to make mortgage loans that were pooled into the
securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asset Management Fund, based in Chicago, said it bought the
securities from May 2003 to May 2007 from the defendants, which
also include Bear Stearns  Co. and Washington Mutual Inc. (WAMUQ), both
of which were acquired by JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Plaintiffs did not know the true facts regarding
defendants&#8217; misrepresentations and omissions in the offering
materials, and justifiably relied on those misrepresentations
and omissions,&#8221; lawyers for Asset Management Fund said in court
documents. &#8220;Defendants&#8217; wrongdoing has led directly to
plaintiffs&#8217; damages, which include loss of market value on the
securities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tasha Pelio, a spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment on the lawsuit in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Asset Management Fund v. JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
650320/2012, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nationwide Title Clearing Sued by Illinois Over Documents &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan sued Nationwide
Title Clearing Inc., a Florida company she claims caused the
filing of faulty documents with county clerks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The practices that NTC used were a key contributor to the
mortgage crisis by undermining the integrity and accuracy of the
mortgage servicing and foreclosure process,&#8221; Madigan said
yesterday in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nationwide Title Clearing prepares documents for mortgage
servicers to use against borrowers in default, foreclosure and
bankruptcy, Madigan said. Among the documents are mortgage
assignments used by lenders in foreclosures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NTC employees signed forms used in Illinois foreclosures as
officers of the foreclosing financial institutions and not
Nationwide, often without reading or verifying the documents
they signed, Madigan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;NTC creates documents through an assembly-line process,&#8221;
Madigan said. &#8220;NTC signers typically have little or no role in
the actual creation of documents that they sign.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint, which accuses the Palm Harbor, Florida-based
company of unfair and deceptive acts, was filed yesterday in
state court in Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diane Stein, a spokeswoman for Nationwide, said she
couldn&#8217;t immediately comment on the allegations because company
officials hadn&#8217;t yet seen the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Illinois v. Nationwide Title Clearing Inc.,
12CH03602, Illinois Circuit Court, Cook County, Chancery
Division (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bank of America Wins Dismissal From Allstate Countrywide Suit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. won dismissal from Allstate Corp. (ALL)&#8217;s
lawsuit over the insurer&#8217;s alleged losses from $700 million in
mortgage-backed securities purchased from Countrywide Financial
Corp (CFC). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, as a corporate parent, isn&#8217;t responsible
for the liabilities of Countrywide, the mortgage lender it
acquired in 2008, U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer in Los
Angeles said yesterday. The judge found that the evidence
Allstate provided wasn&#8217;t sufficient to support its allegations
that Bank of America set out to defraud Countrywide&#8217;s creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfaelzer in October had granted Bank of America&#8217;s request
to be dismissed from the case and gave Allstate permission to
amend its claims to address the deficiencies she identified.
Allstate argued in its revised complaint that Bank of America
structured the Countrywide acquisition so as to strip the unit
of all its valuable assets and leave a &#8220;raided&#8221; shell for
creditors to sue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is significant for settlement negotiations,&#8221; James
Kwak, a law professor at the University of Connecticut, said in
a phone interview before the ruling was filed. &#8220;It gives Bank
of America a card to play in negotiations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America merged Countrywide with a subsidiary and
subsequently transferred most of the mortgage lender&#8217;s assets
from that unit, Countrywide Financial, to other Bank of America
operations and retired the Countrywide brand. Allstate claimed
that the asset transfers should be treated as a so-called de
facto merger under Delaware law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfaelzer previously said that under Delaware law an asset
transfer can&#8217;t be treated as a de facto merger, which would make
Bank of America liable as the successor of Countrywide, unless
there was fraud involved. Allstate argued that the consideration
Bank of America paid the Countrywide subsidiary for the assets
was insufficient and was evidence of fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maryellen Thielen, a spokeswoman for Northbrook, Illinois-
based Allstate, didn&#8217;t return a phone call seeking comment on
the decision after regular business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Allstate v. Countrywide, 11-05236, U.S.
District Court, Central District of California (Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MF Futures Customers Compete to Lead Lawsuit Against Corzine &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global Inc. futures customers are competing to lead a
lawsuit against Jon Corzine, the parent company&#8217;s former chief
executive officer, over the alleged theft of $1.2 billion of
their assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Court filings show at least seven actions against Corzine
by futures customers in Manhattan federal court. Plaintiffs who
have nominated themselves to lead a potential group lawsuit
include Sapere CTA Fund LP, which sued Corzine and other former
MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ) executives for $90 million; Seattle
money manager William Fleckenstein, along with Kay P. Tee LLC, a
firm with a trading account at MF Global; and, together, Davide
Accomazzo and Roberto Calle Gracey, who said in court papers
they filed the first action on behalf of futures customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures customers currently are trying to persuade a judge
that their suits shouldn&#8217;t be consolidated with an investor suit
led by the Virginia Retirement System. While investors allege
that Corzine made misleading statements that inflated the prices
of MF Global securities, futures customers allege that he and
other executives misappropriated customer funds, according to
court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the defendants and the laws they are alleged to have
violated are different, lawyers for Kay P. Tee said in a letter
filed in court Feb. 1. Investors allege securities fraud, while
futures customers file claims under commodity and U.S.
racketeering law, they said. Exchange CME Group Inc. and
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), banker to MF Global, are named in futures
customer suits, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Levander, a lawyer for Corzine, didn&#8217;t respond to an
e-mail seeking comment on the lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main investor case is DeAngelis v. Corzine, 11-cv-7866,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Barclays, UniCredit Bankers Should Face Trial, Prosecutor Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former UniCredit SpA (UCG) Chief Executive Officer Alessandro
Profumo is among 20 UniCredit and Barclays Plc (BARC) executives facing
fraud charges in a tax-evasion probe led by a Milan prosecutor,
according to court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutor Alfredo Robledo asked a court in the city to put
the 20 individuals on trial for fraudulent representation in
relation to an international investment plan known as Brontos,
he said in a court filing yesterday. A judge will rule on the
prosecutor&#8217;s request at a later date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UniCredit, Italy&#8217;s largest bank, used the tax vehicle to
increase the bank&#8217;s &#8220;economic benefits,&#8221; Profumo said at the
company&#8217;s annual meeting in April 2010. Prosecutors have been
investigating Brontos since last year when they seized 246
million euros ($321 million) in bank assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profumo, 54, said in a statement yesterday that he welcomes
the chance to be heard in court and he is convinced he acted
correctly. He stepped down as UniCredit CEO in September 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for UniCredit declined to comment, as did a
spokesman for Barclays in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brontos was conceived to mask interest on a deposit account
into dividends earned on fictitious securities, Robledo has said
in court documents. Interest earned on deposits is taxed in full
while dividends are taxed at 5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UniCredit in a November appeal won the return of the assets
that were seized as part of the probe, according to court
documents. UniCredit &#8220;remains convinced that both it and its
employees acted correctly,&#8221; the Milan-based lender said in an
October statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vittorio Ogliengo, UniCredit&#8217;s co-head of financing and
advisory, and Barclays bankers Rupak Chandra and Stefano Filippi
are among those who may go to trial, court documents show.
Ogliengo, Chandra and Filippi didn&#8217;t return e-mails seeking
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Group of 500 Female Wal-Mart Workers File U.S. Bias Claims &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 500 former and current female Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. (WMT) employees filed sex-discrimination claims with the U.S.
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, their attorneys said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The filings were made to preserve the women&#8217;s claims over
pay and promotions against the world&#8217;s largest retailer after
the U.S. Supreme Court last year said their cases couldn&#8217;t be
litigated in a nationwide class-action, or group, lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fight continues to seek justice for the women
employees of Wal-Mart,&#8221; two of their lawyers, Joseph M. Sellers
and Brad Seligman, said in a statement announcing the number of
EEOC claims filed through Jan. 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision June 20, said the
women failed to show a common corporate policy that led to
discrimination against workers at thousands of Wal-Mart and
Sam&#8217;s Club stores across the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workers &#8220;provide no convincing proof of a company-wide
discriminatory pay and promotion policy,&#8221; said Justice Antonin
Scalia in the court&#8217;s majority opinion. Such a policy would help
justify allowing the claims to proceed as one lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the justices voted to reverse a lower-court ruling
allowing the women to sue as a group, four members of the high
court said they&#8217;d have ordered further proceedings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Anyone with a legitimate claim should have their day in
court,&#8221; Greg Rossiter, a spokesman for Bentonville, Arkansas-
based Wal-Mart, said yesterday in a telephone interview. &#8220;These
claims have never been heard on their merits.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court case was Wal-Mart Stores Inc. v. Dukes,
10-277, U.S. Supreme Court (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Stryker President&#8217;s Criminal Charges Dropped by Prosecutors &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former president at Stryker Corp. (SYK) won&#8217;t be prosecuted on
charges of marketing an unapproved mixture of two products for
strengthening human bone growth, U.S. lawyers told a judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government will abandon its 2009 indictment of Mark
Philip, who ran Stryker Biotech LLC, prosecutors said yesterday
in federal court in Boston. The move follows the government&#8217;s
decision last month to drop charges during the trial of three
former Stryker sales representatives. During that trial, Stryker
pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and paid a $15 million fine in
connection with the unapproved marketing of the drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Earlier today, the government had an opportunity to
review some documents that had previously been withheld as
privileged,&#8221; Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeremy M. Sternberg told
U.S. District Judge George O&#8217;Toole Jr. yesterday at a pre-trial
hearing. &#8220;After reviewing the documents, it&#8217;s the government&#8217;s
plan to file a motion to dismiss in the case against Mr.
Philip.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to drop charges against the fourth and final
defendant in the case marks a setback for the U.S. attorney&#8217;s
office in Massachusetts, which has led the nation in health-care
prosecutions in recent years. Philip, the president from 2004 to
2008, was charged with wire fraud and conspiracy. He faced as
long as 20 years in prison if convicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We were able to give the government documents they had
not seen before that showed Mark acted in good faith,&#8221; said
Philip&#8217;s attorney, Stephen G. Huggard of Edwards Wildman Palmer
LLP. &#8220;We showed some of our defense.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huggard wouldn&#8217;t specify what the documents were. He said
the government hadn&#8217;t agreed to drop the case until an hour
before the hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Stryker Biotech LLC, 09-cr-10330, U.S.
District Court, District of Massachusetts (Boston). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Macy&#8217;s Seeks Injunction in Martha Stewart Contract Suit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macy&#8217;s Inc. (M) asked a New York state Supreme Court justice to
issue a preliminary injunction against Martha Stewart Living
Omnimedia Inc. (MSO) in a filing Feb. 1 in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The retailer sued in New York state Supreme Court on Jan.
23 seeking to stop New York-based Martha Stewart Living from
executing a new sales agreement with J.C. Penney Co. (JCP) Macy&#8217;s,
based in Cincinnati, said it renewed a 2006 agreement for Martha
Stewart-branded products that expires in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In court documents filed Feb. 1, lawyers for Macy&#8217;s asked
Justice Jeffery K. Oing to issue the injunction, saying that the
agreement grants the retailer an exclusive right to make and
sell Martha Stewart products in certain categories and the right
to refuse to make and sell other products that are within Macy&#8217;s
product line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An injunction is necessary to prevent Macy&#8217;s from
&#8220;suffering immediate, continuing and incalculable harm as a
result of the unexplained and unlawful breach by defendant
Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. of its exclusive license to
Macy&#8217;s,&#8221; lawyers for Macy&#8217;s said in the court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We value our relationship with Macy&#8217;s and are confident
that we are not breaching the terms of our agreement, Jeanne
Meyer, a spokeswoman for Martha Stewart Living, said in an e-
mail. &#8216;&#8216;MSLO believes it&#8217;s good for our partners, our consumers
and our brand to have a wide range of Martha Stewart products
available in a variety of top retailers and we structure all of
our commercial agreements with this strategy in mind.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Macy&#8217;s Inc. v. Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia
Inc., 650197/2012, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Primary Global&#8217;s Fleishman Asks to Stay Free During Appeal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Primary Global Research LLC executive James
Fleishman, sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison for his role in an
insider-trading scheme, is asking a federal appeals court in New
York to allow him to remain free on appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fleishman was convicted in September of two separate
conspiracy charges for what the U.S. said was a scheme to obtain
and pass along confidential information from technology company
employees who moonlighted as consultants for Mountain View,
California-based Primary Global, a so-called expert-networking
firm. The tips were given to fund managers who paid Primary
Global for consultation calls, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan
denied Fleishman&#8217;s request to dismiss his conviction or grant
him a new trial. Rakoff ordered Fleishman to surrender to U.S.
Bureau of Prisons officials by Feb.7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Fleishman will present substantial questions on
appeal, and therefore this court should order bail pending
appeal,&#8221; his lawyer, Ethan Balogh, said in court papers filed
Jan. 31 with the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balogh said prosecutors failed to establish that any acts
committed to further the conspiracy occurred in New York. He
also said Fleishman, of Santa Clara, California, was improperly
barred from testifying in his own defense after he was directed
to turn over his personal diaries to prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This appeal will present a novel question, and the
government&#8217;s analysis reveals the weakness of its position,&#8221;
Balogh said in court papers. He didn&#8217;t return a voice-mail
message seeking comment on the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Nguyen, 11-cr-32, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;JJ Hid Risperdal Studies to Boost Drug Sales, Lawyer Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson  Johnson hid studies showing its Risperdal anti-
psychotic drug caused diabetes to protect billions of dollars in
sales, a lawyer said in the first personal-injury claim over the
medication to go to trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at JJ&#8217;s Janssen unit knew as early as 1999
that a study found Risperdal caused diabetes at a higher rate
than a competing drug and failed to hand over the results to
regulators probing links between the disease and anti-psychotic
medicines, Fletch Trammell, a lawyer for a former Risperdal
user, told a New Jersey jury yesterday in opening statements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The evidence will show Janssen buried studies for a
competitive advantage,&#8221; Trammell told jurors in state court in
New Brunswick, New Jersey. JJ, the world&#8217;s second-largest
health-products maker, is based in the city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial of Gary Skala&#8217;s claims that his 14 years&#8217; worth
of Risperdal use caused his diabetes began two weeks after JJ
agreed to pay $158 million to settle Texas officials&#8217; claims
that it fraudulently marketed the drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While JJ has faced four states&#8217; claims that it defrauded
Medicaid programs by misleading doctors and regulators about
Risperdal&#8217;s diabetes risks, Skala&#8217;s case is the first brought by
an individual patient to be presented to a jury. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker contends that the study evaluating
Risperdal&#8217;s diabetes risk against that posed by Eli Lilly 
Co.&#8217;s Zyprexa anti-psychotic medication was flawed and that&#8217;s
why it wasn&#8217;t made public, one of the company&#8217;s lawyers told
jurors yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nothing was buried, nothing was hidden and no one was
tricked,&#8221; Jeffrey Peck, a lawyer for JJ, said in his opening
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Jersey case is Skala v. Johnson  Johnson (JNJ), MID-
L-6820-06 (MT), Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division,
Middlesex County (New Brunswick). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Stanford Financial&#8217;s Davis Says Founder Conspired in Fraud &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Stanford Financial Group Co. finance chief James
Davis, testifying as a U.S. government witness, said company
founder R. Allen Stanford conspired with him in an investment
fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis, who pleaded guilty to three felony charges in August
2009 and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors, began testifying
yesterday against his former boss and Baylor University roommate
at Stanford&#8217;s criminal trial in federal court in Houston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked by Assistant U.S. Attorney William Stellmach if he
committed any crimes at Houston-based Stanford Financial Group,
Davis replied, &#8220;Yes sir, I did.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis told the court he lied about the truthfulness of the
statements of Stanford International Bank Ltd., the Antigua-
based financial institution prosecutors say sold fraudulent
certificates of deposit to investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I lied about the nature of these investments,&#8221; Davis
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stellmach then asked, &#8220;Who conspired with you to commit
those crimes?&#8221; Davis replied, &#8220;Mr. Allen Stanford and
others.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford, 61, is accused of leading a $7 billion investment
fraud scheme. Charged with 14 criminal counts including mail
fraud, wire fraud and obstruction of a U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission probe, the financier maintains he isn&#8217;t
guilty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. Stanford, 09-cr-342, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deutsche Bank Told to Pay $19.7 Million Over Currency Option &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Germany&#8217;s biggest bank, was ordered to
pay 15 million euros ($19.7 million) in a lawsuit over a
currency option product it sold to a client. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Frankfurt Regional Court yesterday ruled partly in
favor of German travel company Schauinsland-Reisen GmbH, which
had sought 30 million euros. The judges ruled the company was
experienced in using options to hedge currency risks, so it was
partly responsible for its losses, court spokesman Arne Hasse
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When Deutsche Bank first sold the product it didn&#8217;t have
to warn about risks, as the structure of the option could be
easily understood,&#8221; Hasse said. &#8220;But when additional options
were bought after first losses and the risks increased, the bank
at some point should have warned its customer about the risk
accumulation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany&#8217;s highest civil court last year said the Frankfurt-
based lender had to cover losses caused by a product it called a
&#8220;CMS Spread Ladder Swap&#8221; because the bank didn&#8217;t disclose the
product had an initial negative market value. The judges
yesterday didn&#8217;t adopt the top court&#8217;s reasoning because the
currency derivatives weren&#8217;t as complicated as the CMS swaps,
Hasse said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank failed to prove that it properly warned
Schauinsland-Reisen as the risks increased, Hasse said. About 60
follow-up derivatives were sold, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank spokesman Christian Streckert said the lender
will only comment when it&#8217;s received the written judgment. It
will then decide whether to appeal, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s case is LG Frankfurt am Main, 3-04 O 50/10. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;India&#8217;s Supreme Court Scraps Mobile Licenses Amid 2G Probe &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s Supreme Court canceled 122 mobile-phone permits
whose sale in 2008 sparked the nation&#8217;s biggest corruption
investigation and led to the jailing of a former minister. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Unitech Ltd. (UT), part of the group that bought
licenses used by Norway&#8217;s Telenor ASA (TEL) for its operations in
India, slumped in Mumbai as the court scrapped the permits and
ordered operators to pay as much as 50 million rupees ($1
million) as penalty, according to the ruling by judges G.S.
Singhvi and A.K. Ganguly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s auditor said in a 2010 report the sale of the
airwaves lacked transparency and ineligible bidders bought them
at &#8220;unbelievably low&#8221; prices, denying the treasury of as much
as $31 billion. Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI), India&#8217;s largest wireless
operator, surged the most in 19 months on speculation the
carrier may win more spectrum when the government reallocates
the frequencies released by the cancellations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Finally, some action is being taken on the scam,&#8221; said
Deepti Chaturvedi, executive director of equity research at CLSA
India Ltd. in Mumbai. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t jump to the conclusion&#8221; the
cancellations would help incumbents like Bharti, since the
spectrum would likely be auctioned, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former telecommunications minister Andimuthu Raja, who has
denied all wrongdoing, is in jail in New Delhi facing trial,
while former officials in his ministry and a lawmaker got bail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uninor, the Indian venture between Telenor and Unitech
Group, said it had been &#8220;unfairly treated,&#8221; according to an e-
mailed statement yesterday. It will continue operations for the
time being and &#8220;exercise all options available to ensure that
Uninor continues to operate in India.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tata Teleservices Ltd., Unitech Wireless, and DB Realty
Ltd. have each been ordered to pay 50 million rupees in
penalties, while Loop Telecom and Sistema Shyam Teleservices
have been ordered to pay 20 million rupees each. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government will abide by the court&#8217;s verdict and
prepare rules for auctioning the airwaves, Kapil Sibal, minister
of communications and information technology, told reporters in
New Delhi yesterday. The ministry will &#8220;delink&#8221; the spectrum
it provides to carriers from the permits, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Dow, DuPont, Denki Lose EU Appeal to Cut Rubber Cartel Fines &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DuPont Co. (DD), Dow Chemical Co. (DOW), and Denki Kagaku Kogyo KK (4061)
lost bids to overturn antitrust fines by the European Union for
claims they colluded to fix prices in the rubber chemical
industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission was right in the findings and fines
it imposed for the cartel, the EU&#8217;s General Court said in three
separate rulings for the companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU&#8217;s antitrust regulator has &#8220;wide discretion as
regards the methods of calculating fines&#8221; and didn&#8217;t err in the
amounts or the fines themselves, the Luxembourg-based tribunal
said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five companies were fined a total of 247.6 million euros
($325 million) in 2007 by the commission, the European Union&#8217;s
antitrust regulator, for colluding on prices for chloroprene
rubber, used to make latex rubber, from at least 1993 to 2002,
the commission said. Bayer AG, Germany&#8217;s largest drugmaker and
another repeat offender, escaped a 201 million euro fine, as it
had told the regulator about the cartel. An appeal by Eni SpA (ENI),
which received the heaviest fine, is pending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;DuPont is disappointed with the decision&#8221; and is
considering whether to appeal, Eduardo Menchaca, a spokesman for
the company, said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dow will appeal the ruling &#8220;as we continue to remain
convinced of the correctness of our position,&#8221; the company said
in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naoshi Fukawa, a spokesman for Denki Kagaku in Tokyo, said
the company can&#8217;t comment until it has read the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DuPont received a 15 million-euro fine and Dow was fined
4.4 million euros individually. The commission fined their
former joint venture 44.3 million euros, to be shared by the two
companies. Dow transferred its stake in the joint venture to
Wilmington, Delaware-based DuPont in 2005 and it was renamed
DuPont Performance Elastomers LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eni, Italy&#8217;s largest oil company, got a 60 percent fine
increase to 132.2 million euros for being a repeat offender. Its
appeal is being reviewed separately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tosoh Corp. (4042), a Japan petrochemical maker, didn&#8217;t fight the
decision after receiving a 50 percent cut in its fine for
cooperating with the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are T-76/08 Pending Case, E.I. du Pont de Nemours
and others v Commission; T-77/08 Pending Case, Dow Chemical v
Commission; T-83/08 Pending Case, Denki Kagaku Kogyo and Denka
Chemicals v Commission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bonus for Sherwood, co-chief of the bank in London, was
34 percent down on last year and will be transferred to him over
three years, the Times said. The bonus is in addition to $2.5
million in shares that Sherwood received last week, the
