<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)''s four-year hunt
for billions of dollars in nationalized Venezuelan oil profits
isn''t finished after an international panel slashed the U.S. oil
company''s claim by 89 percent. </p>
<p>Venezuela''s state-controlled oil producer, known by the
acronym PDVSA (PDVSA), was ordered to pay Exxon $746.9 million for the
2007 seizure of oil wells, crude-processing facilities and
related equipment, according to a copy of the International
Chamber of Commerce''s Dec. 23 ruling obtained by Bloomberg News.
The award represents 11 percent of the $7 billion sought by
Exxon, the world''s largest company (XOM) by market value. </p>
<p>Exxon, the first international energy explorer to abandon
Venezuela four-and-a-half years ago when Hugo Chavez
consolidated control of the nation''s oil industry, is counting
on a separate arbitration case overseen by the World Bank to win
billions in potential profits the company says were lost as a
result of the nationalization, said Lysle Brinker, director of
energy equity research at IHS Inc. (IHS) </p>
<p>Initially, this looks like a pretty low number because it
does not fully reflect the value of the assets Exxon lost,
Brinker said yesterday in a telephone interview from Norwalk,
Connecticut. But this is not over yet. </p>
<p>Exxon and the Venezuelan government are scheduled to resume
arguments before the World Bank panel in February. </p>
<p>Cerro Negro </p>
<p>Exxon sought arbitration with PDVSA and the Venezuelan
government in 2007, a decade after Mobil Corp. began drilling
wells in the Orinoco River basin and building facilities to
process the region''s thick, tar-like crude. Exxon acquired (XOM) Mobil
and assumed operations of the Cerro Negro venture in 1999. </p>
<p>PDVSA said yesterday on its website that it will pay $255
million in cash for the judgment, after accounting for about
$300 million in a frozen New York bank account and $191 million
in Exxon debt that the Venezuelan company will cancel. The total
amount of the International Chamber of Commerce ruling was for
$907.6 million, minus a $161 million counterclaim by PDVSA. </p>
<p>ConocoPhillips (COP), which joined Exxon in rejecting Venezuela''s
new terms in 2007, also is awaiting a ruling in its case before
the World Bank panel. </p>
<p>During the final year of operations under Exxon''s control
in 2006, the Venezuelan assets had net income of $362 million on
sales of $758 million, a profit margin that was quadruple the
company''s worldwide average. Exxon originally sought $12 billion
in compensation for the nationalization and later lowered its
demand to $7 billion. </p>
<p>Fair-Market Value'' </p>
<p>Exxon''s $406 billion market value exceeds Venezuela''s total
economic output and is larger than the gross domestic products
of all but 23 of the world''s nations. </p>
<p>Chavez''s seizure of assets cost Exxon 425 million barrels
of proved reserves at the end of 2007, which had a market value
of $38 billion at the time of the nationalization, based on
Bloomberg calculations. Exxon stock rose 16 percent in 2011, the
largest annual increase since 2007. </p>
<p>The ruling by the New York-based International Chamber of
Commerce probably has few implications for foreign investment in
Venezuela''s energy sector, Brinker said. Although U.S. and
European producers such as Chevron Corp. (CVX), Total SA (FP) and Statoil
ASA (STL) yielded to the 2007 seizures that made them junior partners
to PDVSA, Chavez has been increasingly courting investments from
Russian and Chinese energy firms, Brinker said. </p>
<p>Ratings Unchanged </p>
<p>Standard  Poor''s Ratings Services today said it won''t
change its B+ rating on PDVSA as a result of the ICC judgment.
Given that PDVSA held about $9 billion in cash as of June 30,
the compensation amount will not effect the company''s
liquidity, Fabiola Ortiz, an SP analyst based in Mexico City,
said today in a note to clients. </p>
<p>The separate proceeding before the World Bank''s
International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes
is larger than the ICC case, Patrick McGinn, an Exxon
spokesman, said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>We recognize Venezuela''s legal right to expropriate
assets subject to compensation at fair-market value, McGinn
said. This ICC arbitration award represents recovery on a
limited, contractual liability of PDVSA that was provided for in
the Cerro Negro project agreement. Contract sanctity and respect
for the rule of law are core principles used to manage our
business over the long term. </p>
<p>World Bank Panel </p>
<p>The three-person World Bank panel was created in August
2008 and began deliberations in November 2008, according to case
documents published on the ICSID''s website. The panel was
occupied with jurisdictional arguments until June 2010 and
disputes about document production through March 2011, the
filings showed. Hearings are scheduled to resume next month,
McGinn said. </p>
<p>The panel members are French jurist Gilbert Guillaume,
University of Geneva professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, and
Egyptian lawyer Ahmed Sadek El-Kosheri, according to the ICSID''s
website. </p>
<p>Guillaume, 81, adjudicated a century-old territorial
dispute between Indonesia and Malaysia when he was president of
the International Court of Justice from 2000 to 2003. He also
presided over Belgium''s unsuccessful attempt to prosecute an
African politician for war crimes. </p>
<p>Kaufmann-Kohler, a former director of Zurich-based UBS AG,
was Exxon''s nominee to the panel. El-Kosheri, 79, was
Venezuela''s nominee. He''s a former legal adviser to the Kuwaiti
oil ministry and a partner in the Cairo law firm Kosheri, Rashed
 Riad. Guillaume was assigned to the case by the ICSID. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) must pay more than
$45 million in damages to two women who blamed the company''s
menopause drugs for their breast cancers, an appeals court
ruled. </p>
<p>Connie Barton and Donna Kendall, two Illinois women who
sued Pfizer units Wyeth and Pharmacia  Upjohn over their
menopause medications, deserved both compensatory and punitive
damages over the companies'' handling of the drugs, a panel of
the Pennsylvania Superior Court judge ruled yesterday. </p>
<p>We are very disappointed with the court''s decisions in
these cases and continue to believe there was no basis in fact
or law for the jury verdicts, Chris Loder, a spokesman for New
York-based Pfizer, said in an e-mailed statement. Pfizer
officials will ask the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to review the
lower court''s findings, he said. </p>
<p>More than 6 million women took Prempro and related
menopause drugs to treat symptoms including hot flashes and mood
swings before a 2002 study highlighted their links to cancer. At
one point, Pfizer and its units faced more than 10,000 lawsuits
over the medications. </p>
<p>This is a great way to start 2012 for these two brave
women, Zoe Littlepage, one of Barton''s lawyers, said in a
telephone interview today. Under the appellate ruling, Barton
would get a total of $11.2 million while Kendall would get $34.3
million, Littlepage said. </p>
<p>Wyeth''s sales of its Prempro and Premarin medicines, which
are still on the market, exceeded $2 billion before the release
of the Women''s Health Initiative study sponsored by the National
Institutes of Health. </p>
<p>$840 Million Reserve </p>
<p>Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Wyeth''s
Premarin, an estrogen-based drug, with progestin-laden Provera,
made by Pfizer''s Upjohn unit, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth
combined the two hormones in its Prempro pill. </p>
<p>At the height of the litigation, Pfizer faced more than
10,000 claims that its menopause drugs caused breast cancer,
according to lawyers for former users. Those lawsuits included
more than 8,000 cases consolidated in federal court in Arkansas
and suits in state courts in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Minnesota. </p>
<p>The company has begun settling some suits and has set aside
$840 million so far to resolve cases, officials said in
November. Pfizer has resolved about 46 percent of the pending
Prempro suits, officials said. </p>
<p>Compensatory, Punitive Damages </p>
<p>In Barton''s case, a Philadelphia jury awarded the retired
records clerk $3.7 million in compensatory damages and $75
million in punitives in October 2009. A judge later reduced the
punitive award against Wyeth by more than 90 percent to $5.6
million. </p>
<p>A month later, a separate Philadelphia jury awarded Kendall
$6.3 million in compensatory damages and $28 million in punitive
damages from both Wyeth and Pharmacia  Upjohn. A judge later
cut that punitive award to $1 million. </p>
<p>The state appellate court combined the two verdicts for
review since both involved Illinois residents who brought their
suits in Pennsylvania. Wyeth has operations in the state. </p>
<p>The court ruled jurors properly found that Wyeth and Upjohn
should be held liable for breast cancers tied to their menopause
drugs and both properly faced punitive damage awards over their
handling of the medication. </p>
<p>Kendall''s whole $28 million punitive award was upheld while
Barton''s final punitive award was increased by almost $2 million
to $7.4 million under the court''s ruling. </p>
<p>There was sufficient evidence of gross negligence and
willful and wanton misconduct to support imposition of punitive
damages, the panel said in its 46-page ruling in Barton''s
case. </p>
<p>Extraordinary Victory'' </p>
<p>The court noted that while Kendall''s punitive award was
large, it correlated with the enormity of the defendants''
wrongs, their clear liability and the devastating impact on the
plaintiff, according to the 53-page decision. </p>
<p>This is an extraordinary victory for Mrs. Kendall, Tobi Millrood, one of her lawyers, said in an e-mailed statement.
The appellate court didn''t mince words: Wyeth and Upjohn
engaged in a pattern of misconduct that was not the result of
mere accident or happenstance. </p>
<p>The cases are Connie J. Barton v. Wyeth Pharmaceuticals
Inc., 694 EDA 2010, Superior Court of Pennsylvania; Donna
Kendall v. Wyeth Inc., 936 EDA 2010, Superior Court of
Pennsylvania. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) reached a long-term
agreement with Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) that provides cable TV subscribers
with programs on TVs, computers and mobile devices. </p>
<p>The agreement comes a year before existing accords expire
and will run for a decade, according to a person with knowledge
of the situation who wasn''t authorized to speak publicly. </p>
<p>Disney may receive $22 billion to $25 billion for ESPN
programming alone over the 10 years, said Derek Baine, an
analyst at SNL Kagan. The accord with Comcast, the largest U.S.
pay-TV company, averts fee disputes that can interrupt cable
service. For the first time, Comcast customers will be able to
watch ESPN, Disney and ABC shows live or on demand on multiple
screens, the companies said in a statement today. </p>
<p>The consumer ultimately gets more utility, said David Bank, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in New York. I think
it generally helps justify higher affiliate fees. </p>
<p>The agreement will deliver 70 separate services from
Disney, ABC and ESPN to customers of Philadelphia-based Comcast
and includes new technologies that may arise over the period,
the companies said in the statement. Financial terms of the
arrangement weren''t disclosed. </p>
<p>Analyst Baine estimates ESPN program fees will rise 6
percent to 8 percent annually. Payments for Disney channels,
mobile applications and other services will add to the total, he
estimated. </p>
<p>All Inclusive </p>
<p>The accord includes Disney cable channels and ABC broadcast
stations owned by the Burbank, California-based company,
according to the statement. Comcast will introduce Disney
Junior, a new 24-hour basic cable channel for preschoolers, the
companies said. </p>
<p>We see this deal as a template for other deals we''re
negotiating, although there aren''t many that have the breadth
and scope that Disney brings, Neil Smit, president of Comcast
Cable (TCOMA), said in an interview. </p>
<p>The agreement marks the first time Disney cable channels
will stream content to authenticated pay-TV customers using
mobile devices and computers. ESPN already had such agreements
with 40 million pay-TV homes, George Bodenheimer,
executive chairman of the sports network, said in an interview. </p>
<p>We''re working on more of them, Bodenheimer said </p>
<p>Disney, the theme-park and media company, rose 1.4 percent
to $38.85 at the close in New York. The shares were little
changed last year. Comcast, which had 20.3 million video
subscribers at the close of the third quarter, gained 1 percent
to $24.73 after rising 8 percent in 2011. </p>
<p>In August 2010, Comcast signed a 10-year accord with CBS
Corp. (CBS) for access to the company''s Showtime premium cable network
and its TV stations. </p>
<p>We have similar deals in structure that we will be
pursuing, Anne Sweeney, co-chairman of Disney Media Networks,
said in an interview. We think that this is the future of how
viewers will be watching their TV and consuming content. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX) lost its challenge to
an $18 billion judgment before an Ecuador appeals court in a
lawsuit alleging the company is responsible for chemicals
spilled in the Amazon River basin more than 20 years ago. </p>
<p>The decision upholding the lower-court judgment was issued
by a panel of three judges in the Provincial Court of Justice of
Sucumbios in Lago Agrio, Ecuador, Chevron said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday. </p>
<p>Chevron appealed a February ruling that it was responsible
for chemical-laden wastewater dumped in jungle land from 1964 to
about 1992 by Texaco Inc., which Chevron acquired in 2001. </p>
<p>The appeals court''s decision gives us the ability to go
ahead and enforce the judgment in any part of the world we see
legally fit, Pablo Fajardo, an attorney representing 30,000
Ecuadorean Amazon residents who sued, said in a conference call
from Quito. We will investigate and look at various continents
around the world where Chevron has assets. </p>
<p>Chevron, the second-largest U.S. energy company, has no
assets or operations in Ecuador. The plaintiffs must wait until
the appeals court makes its decision final, which could take at
least a two weeks, before moving ahead with enforcement actions
in foreign courts, Fajardo said. </p>
<p>The Ecuador appeals court could require San Ramon,
California-based Chevron to post a bond equal to a percentage of
the $18 billion judgment, Fajardo said. Bond payment would block
the plaintiffs'' ability to enforce the judgment elsewhere
pending the outcome of a further appeal by Chevron to the
country''s highest court, he said. The bond should be at least $3
billion, Fajardo said; the amount is up to the appeals court. </p>
<p>Glaring Example'' </p>
<p>The decision is another glaring example of the
politicization and corruption of Ecuador''s judiciary that has
plagued this fraudulent case from the start, Chevron said in
yesterday''s statement. The company does not believe that the
Ecuador ruling is enforceable in any court that observes the
rule of law. </p>
<p>The appeals court ratified the February ruling in all of
its parts, including the conviction for moral reparation or its
alternative and costs, according to the decision. </p>
<p>Chevron is still reviewing the ruling and hasn''t decided
what it will do next, Kent Robertson, a spokesman for the
company, said yesterday in a phone interview. He said the
company has a procedural right to seek clarification and
amplification from the court that issued this ruling. </p>
<p>Chevron''s Options </p>
<p>Chevron can also appeal the decision to the next level of
Ecuador''s judiciary, Robertson said. </p>
<p>Karen Hinton, a spokeswoman for lawyers representing the
Ecuador residents who sued Chevron, said in an e-mailed
statement, The decision by an independent appellate court is
yet further confirmation of Chevron''s extraordinary greed and
criminal misconduct in Ecuador. </p>
<p>Chevron filed a claim in 2009 against Ecuador in the
Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague seeking orders that
it has no liability for the environmental pollution and that
PetroEcuador, the state-owned oil company that took over the
site, should pay the damage award. In those proceedings, Ecuador
was told in February to prevent enforcement of the judgment
until further order by the tribunal, Chevron said yesterday. </p>
<p>Not Good'' </p>
<p>In September, the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York
overturned a lower-court decision blocking enforcement of the
award by the court in Ecuador. </p>
<p>This is not good for Chevron, although it was expected,
Fadel Gheit, an analyst at Oppenheimer  Co., said in a phone
interview today. Chevron will exhaust all legal options, which
could drag for years. </p>
<p>Gheit said that he expected Chevron to eventually pay $2
billion to $3 billion. </p>
<p>We are going to have to watch this play out through the
international court system and the U.S. court system, Brian Youngberg, an Edward Jones analyst in St. Louis, said in a phone
interview. </p>
<p>It is going to be dragged out, said Youngberg, who
rates Chevron shares a buy and doesn''t own any. </p>
<p>Very Content'' </p>
<p>Investors still expect the ultimate outcome won''t cost
the company, Youngberg said. There is really very little
that Ecuador can go after in the country and Chevron doesn''t
really have any material assets there. </p>
<p>Hinton said that the plaintiffs will seek to enforce the
judgment in countries where Chevron has assets. </p>
<p>Ecuador President Rafael Correa said he was very
content with the ruling. </p>
<p>I believe justice has been done, Correa said on public
radio station Radio Publica. More or less it''s like David
versus Goliath. </p>
<p>Chevron fell 16 cents to $110.21 at 3 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) sued Kesa Electricals
Plc (KESA)''s Comet unit for allegedly selling more than 94,000
counterfeit disks. </p>
<p>Comet made fake versions of Windows Vista and Windows XP
recovery CDs at a factory in Hampshire, England, then sold them
at its retail outlets across the U.K., Microsoft said in a
statement on its website. </p>
<p>Comet produced and sold thousands of counterfeit Windows
CDs to unsuspecting customers in the United Kingdom, said
David Finn, associate general counsel in Microsoft''s anti-piracy
unit, in a statement on its website. </p>
<p>Microsoft has replaced Vista and Windows XP with Windows 7,
the operating system it introduced in October 2009. Together,
the Windows products run more than 90 percent of the world''s PCs
and account for 27 percent of Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft''s revenue (MSFT), according to Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>Comet said in an e-mailed statement it hadn''t infringed
Microsoft''s copyright and would defend the claim vigorously.
Kesa agreed in November to sell the money-losing Comet unit to
focus on markets such as France. </p>
<p>The Business Software Alliance, a lobbying group whose

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) supplanted
Morgan Stanley (MS) as the leading adviser of mergers and
acquisitions last year in the $3.1 trillion chemical industry. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, based in New York, participated in 16
transactions last year with a combined value of $22.7 billion,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg, based on announced
deals and including financing and underwriting roles. Morgan
Stanley was fourth after Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Morgan Stanley was No. 1 in 2009 and 2010. </p>
<p>Transaction volume fell by 25 percent to $91.7 billion in
2011 from a year earlier as Europe''s debt crisis led chief
executive officers to avoid multi-billion-dollar deals in the
second half. JPMorgan''s tally includes advising potash producer
Mosaic Co. (MOS) when investor Cargill Inc. sold its stake. It worked
with DuPont Co. (DD) on its takeover of food-additives maker Danisco. </p>
<p>Once the wait-and-see mode has changed we might see some
positive surprises, said Ken Oliver Fritz, head of investment
banking in Germany at Credit Suisse. CEO confidence is the
most important factor and will have to improve if we want to see
more transactions in 2012. </p>
<p>Consolidation is waiting to happen in several industries
and getting the right timing is important, Fritz said.
Opportunities abound for companies with cash on their balance
sheets as valuations are low compared to historical levels, he
said. </p>
<p>Last year''s biggest chemical deal was Warren Buffett''s
$9.22 billion acquisition of Lubrizol Corp. where advisers
included Citigroup Inc. (C) and Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR) DuPont paid
$7.1 billion for Danisco. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Datel Design and
Development Inc. settled patent-infringement and antitrust
litigation, according to Dec. 30 court filings. </p>
<p>The suits were related to the Xbox 360 video-game system. </p>
<p>Datel, based in Staffordshire, England, sued Microsoft in
federal court in San Francisco in November 2009, claiming that
an upgrade issued by Microsoft was intended to disable Datel
products. </p>
<p>Microsoft then sued Datel in federal court in Seattle in

of photographer James Marshall. </p>
<p>The suit is related to a series of photos of rock music
performers the estate claims are used in Bloomingdale''s and

<p>According to the complaint filed Dec. 29 in federal court

<p>Varvatos bought proof copies of these photos and is accused
of making unauthorized copies to display in his store in New
York. </p>
<p>When Marshall learned of this while he was still alive, he
put Varvatos on notice that it wasn''t acceptable and did
Varvatos a favor and allowed him to keep the reproductions on
the wall in the one store and the one store only, according to
court papers. </p>
<p>After Marshall''s death, Varvatos is accused of making new
infringing reproductions to display in additional stores. </p>

court for an order barring future use of the images by the
defendants, and awards of money damages, attorney fees and
litigation costs. </p>

<p>Apple Loses Bid to Keep Software Information Under Seal </p>
<p>Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s bid to keep under seal information it called
trade secrets, even though it''s already available on the

<p>Bank of America Corp. (BAC) lost a ruling
in a court fight against MBIA Inc. (MBI) that will help the bond
insurer as it tries to recover losses on home loans made by the
bank''s Countrywide Financial unit. </p>
<p>MBIA, which says it was duped into guaranteeing payment on
Countrywide mortgage bonds, needs only to show the lender made
misrepresentations about the loans backing the bonds, instead of
establishing they caused the losses the insurer is seeking to
recover, New York state Judge Eileen Bransten said in a decision
issued yesterday. </p>
<p>No basis in law exists to mandate that MBIA establish a
direct causal link between the misrepresentations allegedly made
by Countrywide and claims made under the policy, she wrote. </p>
<p>The ruling is among legal disputes with bond insurers and
investors that could significantly impact the potential
costs from loans made before the collapse of the U.S. housing
market in 2008, Bank of America said in a regulatory filing in
August. </p>
<p>Defeats on such matters may add as much as $9 billion to
what Bank of America owes bond insurers, according to an August
estimate by hedge fund Branch Hill Capital, which has bet
against the lender''s stock and has invested in MBIA. </p>
<p>MBIA, which sued Countrywide in 2008, guarantees payments
to investors that bought securities backed by pools of the
lender''s loans. The insurer says the loans were riskier than
Countrywide promised, and as they defaulted, the Armonk, New
York-based company was forced to make payments. Through
September 2010, MBIA had paid out $2.5 billion on mortgage
securities sponsored by Countrywide, Chief Executive Officer Jay
Brown told a New York State Assembly committee in February. </p>
<p>Brown said in an e-mailed statement that the company is
very pleased with the decision. </p>
<p>The ruling provides us with a straightforward path to
recovery of our losses, he said. </p>
<p>Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America is still
reviewing the ruling, spokesman Lawrence Grayson said in a phone
interview. He pointed out that the judge denied a ruling
requested by MBIA in connection with Countrywide''s obligations
to repurchase loans. </p>

Inc., 602825-2008, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). </p>

<p>New Suits </p>
<p>Wegelin Bankers Said to Be Charged by U.S. in Tax Crackdown </p>
<p>Three Swiss bankers charged with conspiring to help U.S.
clients hide more than $1.2 billion from American tax
authorities worked at Switzerland''s Wegelin  Co., a person
familiar with the matter said. </p>
<p>Michael Berlinka, Urs Frei and Roger Keller told clients
that they were less vulnerable to a U.S. crackdown on offshore
tax evasion because their bank didn''t have offices outside
Switzerland, according to an indictment filed yesterday in
federal court in Manhattan. </p>
<p>The bank was Wegelin, according to the person, who wasn''t
authorized to speak about the matter and didn''t want to be
identified. The indictment refers to Swiss Bank A and said
all three worked at its Zurich branch. No one answered calls
after regular business hours at Wegelin, Switzerland''s oldest
private bank. Wegelin Bank''s Thomas Tschudi didn''t respond to an
e-mail seeking comment. </p>
<p>The indictment comes amid U.S.-Swiss talks to resolve a
U.S. probe of offshore tax evasion. Officials are trying to
conclude negotiations on a civil settlement with Swiss banks, as
well as criminal probes of 11 of them, including Wegelin, based
in St. Gallen. </p>
<p>Prosecutors have filed tax charges against more than three
dozen former U.S. clients of UBS AG (UBSN) and Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN),
Switzerland''s two biggest banks, and London-based HSBC Holdings
Plc (HSBA), Europe''s biggest bank. At least 24 bankers, advisers and
attorneys also have been charged. </p>
<p>The indictment details how Berlinka, Frei and Keller helped
23 U.S. clients open undeclared accounts at their bank. Kenneth
Heller, a disbarred New York maritime attorney who pleaded
guilty on June 27 to hiding more than $26.4 million in accounts
at UBS and Wegelin, is also referred to in the indictment. He is
scheduled to be sentenced Jan. 20. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Sued for $95 Million Over Mortgage Securities </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S. bank by assets, was
sued for about $95 million over mortgage loans bundled into
securities. </p>
<p>JPMorgan materially breached representations about
loans backing the securities, a mortgage-securitization trust
said in a summons filed Dec. 30 in New York State Supreme Court
in Manhattan. </p>
<p>The Bear Stearns trust is seeking damages of at least $95
million, according to the court filing. Bear Stearns Cos., which
was acquired by New York-based JPMorgan, and EMC Mortgage Corp.
are also named as defendants. </p>
<p>Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to
comment on the lawsuit. </p>

Supreme Court (Manhattan). </p>
<p>WJB Capital Group Sued by Investor Alleging Fraud </p>
<p>WJB Capital Group Inc., the Wall Street firm that said it''s
shutting down its brokerage operations, was sued by an investor
over fraud allegations. </p>
<p>WJB Capital and Chief Executive Officer Craig Rothfeld were
accused of fraud, breach of contract and other claims over a
$250,000 investment in the company, according to a lawsuit filed
Dec. 31 in New York State Supreme Court. </p>
<p>James McNally said that in exchange for a $250,000
investment he was promised compensation for the duration of
the investment. WJB Capital failed to pay and used the money
for fraudulent purposes, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>We deny the allegations, Rothfeld said about McNally''s
complaint. They are baseless and without merit. </p>
<p>An attorney for McNally didn''t reply to a message seeking
comment. </p>
<p>WJB Capital voluntarily ceased broker-dealer operations
yesterday, Rothfeld said. The company was unable to raise
capital in a manner that would have allowed the firm to continue
its operations given the current climate and the constraints
that would have been placed on everyone, the CEO said </p>

<p>Lawsuits/Pretrial </p>
<p>JPMorgan May Know Soon If Lehman Lawsuit Will Be Dismissed </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., fighting Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. (LEHMQ) over billions of dollars in claims and damages, may know
soon whether its bid to dismiss the defunct firm''s $8.6 billion
lawsuit will succeed, a district judge said. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan in New York said he is
working on a decision on whether Lehman''s suit against the
biggest U.S. bank belongs in district court, according to court
papers. However, a bankruptcy judge may be ready to rule soon on
JPMorgan''s move to dismiss the case, and should do so first,
Sullivan told both sides, according to a transcript of a Dec. 30
court session. </p>
<p>I don''t want to be in a situation where the bankruptcy
court is just doing nothing because they''re waiting for me to
rule, Sullivan said. They got this thing all teed up, maybe
just ready to press a button on it. </p>
<p>Lehman''s suit alleges the New York-based lender helped
cause its 2008 collapse by demanding $8.6 billion in collateral.
JPMorgan has argued that the case needs a district judge because
it raises legal issues beyond the jurisdiction of a bankruptcy
judge, who can''t rule on matters including Lehman''s allegation
that JPMorgan caused monetary damage to failing Lehman in 2008.
Lehman says the suit confines itself to bankruptcy matters. </p>
<p>Separately, JPMorgan is defending $6 billion in claims that
Lehman says are significantly overstated. </p>
<p>Lehman filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history in
September 2008, listing $613 billion in debt. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, which lent $70 billion to Lehman''s brokerage
around the time of the bankruptcy, sued Lehman back after the
$8.6 billion suit, alleging Lehman defrauded its lender into
making the loan. </p>
<p>The main case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
08-13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). The lawsuit is Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 10-03266, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The district case is
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. v. JPMorgan Chase  Bank, 11-
cv-6760, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>
<p>BP Seeks Recovery of All Gulf Spill Costs From Halliburton </p>
<p>BP Plc (BP/) seeks to have Halliburton Co. (HAL), its cement contractor
for the Macondo well project whose blowout set off the 2010 Gulf
of Mexico oil spill, pay all of the oil company''s related costs
and damages. </p>
<p>BP had paid more than $21 billion in cleanup costs and
economic damages to individuals, businesses and governments
harmed by the spill as of Dec. 1, the company said on its
website. BP reserved more than $40 billion to cover costs
related to the sinking of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig (RIG). </p>
<p>The oil company seeks the amount of costs and expenses
incurred by BP to clean up and remediate the oil spill, the lost
profits from and/or diminution in value of the Macondo prospect,
and all other costs and damages incurred by BP related to the
Deepwater Horizon incident and resulting oil spill, Don
Haycraft, BP''s lead trial attorney, said in a filing Jan. 2 in
federal court in New Orleans. </p>
<p>BP and Halliburton accuse each other''s employees of making
critical mistakes that caused the blowout of the London-based
oil company''s well off the Louisiana coast in 2010. The
explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon killed 11 workers and
caused the worst offshore spill in U.S. history. </p>
<p>BP, which owned the Macondo lease, and Halliburton, which
provided well-completion services for the project, jointly face
more than 500 lawsuits by coastal property owners, businesses
and governments claiming billions of dollars in damages from the
drifting oil. The lawsuits have been combined for pretrial
processing in federal court in New Orleans, where a judge is
scheduled to begin a trial in February to determine liability
for the spill. </p>
<p>Halliburton, based in Houston, has said in court papers
that its cementing-services contract requires BP to indemnify it
from all damage claims, even if its employees were found to have
shared blame for the disaster. </p>
<p>BP, rejecting that argument, accused Halliburton in the
Jan. 2 filing of gross negligence. That level of misconduct
will suffice to eliminate any indemnity obligation for damages
of any kind, Haycraft said in the filing. </p>
<p>The case is In Re Oil Spill by the Oil Rig Deepwater
Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010, MDL-2179, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New Orleans). </p>

<p>Coal Producers Rise on Court''s Delay of EPA Pollution Rule </p>
<p>U.S. coal producers including Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU) and
Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR) rose after a federal court ruled
that the Environmental Protection Agency must delay implementing
air-pollution regulations. </p>
<p>Peabody, the largest U.S. coal-mining company, rose as much
as 10 percent. James River Coal Co. (JRCC), which operates mines in
Kentucky, gained as much as 13 percent while Patriot Coal Corp. (PCX)
advanced as much as 9.1 percent. </p>
<p>The U.S. Appeals Court in Washington on Dec. 30 granted a
request by electric power producers and other challengers to
delay the deadline for some plants to start reducing some
polluting emissions. </p>
<p>The EPA''s Cross-State Air Pollution Rule seeks to impose
caps on sulfur dioxide, which can lead to acid rain, and
nitrogen dioxide, a component of smog, in Texas and 26 eastern
states. </p>

<p>Stanford Seeks Trial Delay After Court Puts Expert Pay on Hold </p>
<p>R. Allen Stanford, accused of running a $7 billion
investment fraud, seeks a three-month delay in his Jan. 23 trial
date after his expert witnesses quit because they weren''t being
paid. </p>
<p>Stanford''s experts haven''t been paid for four months, Ali
Fazel, Stanford''s lead criminal-defense lawyer, said in court
papers filed Dec. 30 in federal court in Houston. They quit last
week after the U.S. Court of Appeals, which controls budgets for
Stanford''s publicly funded defense, ruled that it will modify
and limit the expert budget moving forward and withhold
payments to them until after the trial, Fazel said. </p>
<p>Stanford, 61, has been in custody since he was indicted in
June 2009 on charges of defrauding investors through bogus
certificates of deposit at his Antigua-based Stanford
International Bank. </p>
<p>Stanford was declared mentally fit for trial on Dec. 22,
after completing eight months of rehabilitation at a federal
prison hospital in Butner, North Carolina. U.S. District Judge
David Hittner found the former financier had sufficiently
recovered from head injuries suffered in a September 2009
jailhouse assault and an addiction to anxiety drugs prescribed
by prison doctors following the attack. </p>
<p>Fazel said in the Dec. 30 filings that prosecutors didn''t
oppose a one-week delay in yesterday''s deadline for filing
expert reports in the case. </p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Gregg Costa told Hittner last month
that the government doesn''t oppose a delay of six to eight weeks
in Stanford''s trial to give him more time to review documents
with his attorneys. </p>
<p>Laura Sweeney, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined
to comment on the request for a three-month delay, citing a gag
order issued by the judge. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Stanford, 09-cr-00342, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston). </p>
<p>Exxon''s Pursuit of Venezuelan Cash Not Over Yet'' After Ruling </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)''s four-year hunt for billions of dollars
in nationalized Venezuelan oil profits isn''t finished after an
international panel slashed the U.S. oil company''s claim by 89
percent. </p>
<p>Venezuela''s state-controlled oil producer, known by the
acronym PDVSA (PDVSA), was ordered to pay Exxon $746.9 million for the
2007 seizure of oil wells, crude-processing facilities and
related equipment, according to a copy of the International
Chamber of Commerce''s Dec. 23 ruling obtained by Bloomberg News.
The award represents 11 percent of the $7 billion sought by
Exxon, the world''s largest company (XOM) by market value. </p>
<p>Exxon, the first international energy explorer to abandon
Venezuela 4 1/2 years ago when Hugo Chavez consolidated control
of the nation''s oil industry, is counting on a separate
arbitration case overseen by the World Bank to win billions in
potential profits the company says were lost as a result of the
nationalization, said Lysle Brinker, director of energy equity
research at IHS Inc. (IHS) </p>
<p>Initially, this looks like a pretty low number because it
does not fully reflect the value of the assets Exxon lost,
Brinker said Jan. 2 in a telephone interview from Norwalk,
Connecticut. But this is not over yet. </p>
<p>Exxon and the Venezuelan government are scheduled to resume
arguments before the World Bank panel in February. </p>
<p>Exxon sought arbitration with PDVSA and the Venezuelan
government in 2007, a decade after Mobil Corp. began drilling
wells in the Orinoco River basin and building facilities to
process the region''s thick, tar-like crude. Exxon acquired (XOM) Mobil
and assumed operations of the Cerro Negro venture in 1999. </p>
<p>PDVSA said yesterday on its website that it will pay $255
million in cash for the judgment, after accounting for about
$300 million in a frozen New York bank account and $191 million
in Exxon debt that the Venezuelan company will cancel. The total
amount of the International Chamber of Commerce ruling was for
$907.6 million, minus a $161 million counterclaim by PDVSA. </p>
<p>The separate proceeding before the World Bank''s
International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes
is larger than the ICC case, Patrick McGinn, an Exxon
spokesman, said Jan. 2 in an e-mailed statement. </p>

<p>U.K. Plans Appeal to Court Ruling Against Solar Subsidy Cut </p>
<p>The U.K. government will appeal a High Court ruling against
its decision to cut subsidies for solar power, a spokeswoman for
the Department of Energy and Climate Change said. </p>
<p>Lawyers for the government will submit the appeal today,
the spokeswoman said by phone yesterday, asking not to be named
in line with the department''s policy. </p>
<p>The High Court in London ruled on Dec. 21 that a government
decision to cut a feed-in tariff for solar energy starting on
Dec. 12 was unlawful. </p>
<p>The court decision was a victory for companies including
Solarcentury Holdings Ltd., which challenged the plan to reduce
rates paid for solar by as much as 55 percent before a
consultation with the industry finished on Dec. 23. </p>
<p>Barker said on Twitter yesterday he planned to publish
proposals to reform the feed-in tariff scheme this month to make
it more like Germany. The spokeswoman said the government
aimed to publish the proposals, a second consultation that would
consider tariffs for non-solar photovoltaic technologies, as
soon as possible. </p>
<p>Lawmakers in both the ruling Conservative Party and the
Labour opposition say cuts are necessary to prevent a surge in
solar power from jacking up electricity bills. Climate Change
Minister Greg Barker wrote on his Twitter feed yesterday that he
would appeal the decision. </p>
<p>The current high tariffs for solar PV are not
sustainable, and changes need to be made in order to protect the
budget, which is funded by consumers through their energy
bills, Barker said in a statement in December. </p>

<p>Verdicts/Settlements </p>
<p>Union Carbide Asbestos Verdict Erased by Mississippi Judge </p>
<p>A $322 million jury verdict in an asbestos case against Dow
Chemical Co. (DOW)''s Union Carbide unit and Chevron Phillips Chemical
Co. was overturned by a Mississippi judge. </p>
<p>The companies asked the state Supreme Court to overturn the
verdict, saying Smith County Circuit Judge Eddie Bowen had a
conflict of interest because his parents had asbestos legal
claims, including one against Union Carbide. </p>
<p>The state''s high court removed Bowen from the case last
year. His replacement, Special Judge William F. Coleman, said on
Dec. 22 that the companies'' request to remove Bowen and vacate
the verdict were well taken and should be granted. </p>
<p>The May 4, 2011, verdict was the largest ever made to a
single asbestos case plaintiff, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. State punitive-damages restrictions would have
reduced the verdict by at least $260 million. Coleman''s order
doesn''t include information on a new trial. The jury award was
the ninth-largest in the U.S. overall in 2011, according to
Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>Dow Chemical spokesman Scot Wheeler wasn''t available to
comment on the judge''s order. Bowen''s court administrator, Judy
Herrington, said he was out of the office and wouldn''t comment
on the case. </p>
<p>Plaintiff Thomas Brown claimed he developed asbestosis
after being exposed to the toxic fibers while mixing drilling
mud on oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. He claimed Union Carbide
and Chevron Phillips knew asbestos is toxic and didn''t warn him. </p>
<p>The case is Brown v. Phillips Co., 2006-196, Circuit Court,
Smith County, Mississippi (Raleigh). </p>

<p>Union Drilling Inc. (UDRL), the rig owner
hired by Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) to explore U.S. shale rock formations
for natural gas, toughened drug testing of rig workers in an
attempt to cut down on accidents. </p>
<p>Union is switching to hair-follicle tests from urinalysis
to detect drug use, Chief Executive Officer Christopher Strong
said at the Pritchard Capital energy conference in San Francisco
yesterday. The new protocol already has reduced emergency calls
from its drilling sites, he said, according to a transcript of
his presentation. </p>
<p>Energy producers exploring shale rock are facing increased
scrutiny from environmental regulators, landowners, lawmakers
and investors after intensive drilling techniques were linked to
water contamination and earthquakes. Drug abuse tends to be more
frequent among drilling crews than other oilfield workers, Roger
New, vice chairman of the Energy Training Council in Yukon,
Oklahoma, said in an interview today. </p>
<p>The screening process on new hires has really been ramped
up a lot, Strong said. We''re just not seeing nearly as much
hotline traffic about problems on the rigs. He didn''t return a
call to his office in Fort Worth, Texas, today. </p>
<p>The Macondo Effect </p>
<p>The industry is more worried about safety and liability
since BP Plc''s 2010 rig disaster at the Macondo well in the Gulf
of Mexico killed 11 workers and provoked a safety crackdown,
John Keller, an analyst at Stephens Inc. in Houston, said today
in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>There''s a PR liability, if not a real liability, if some
guy''s stoned and messes up on a rig, he said. </p>
<p>Drug use historically has been a problem among rig workers,
perhaps because of the lack of outside licensing requirements
that govern other jobs, such as truck driving, New said, whose
full-time job is safety manager with Oklahoma City-based Great
White Pressure Control. </p>
<p>It''s hard work, said David Pursell, a former petroleum
engineer who''s now a managing director at Tudor Pickering Holt 
Co. in Houston. The pool of folks who want to work in the
oilfield is narrower than a traditional manufacturing
operation. </p>
<p>Fracking Shale </p>
<p>Union''s fleet of 51 land-based rigs focuses mostly on
horizontal drilling, the practice of cutting sideways through a
geologic formation to reach more gas or crude. Extracting fuel
from shale requires the use of horizontal wells and blasting
millions of gallons of high-pressure water, chemicals and sand
to break rock thousands of feet underground, a technique known
as hydraulic fracturing. </p>
<p>The number of rigs drilling horizontal wells (BAKEHORZ) in the U.S.
surged 23 percent in 2011, reaching 1,184 on Dec. 16, the
highest since at least January 1991, according to Baker Hughes
Inc. (BHI), an oilfield-services provider that tracks rig activity. </p>
<p>Union drills wells in several of the major U.S. shale
formations, including the Fayetteville region of Arkansas and
Oklahoma, and the Marcellus and Utica shales in Appalachia. </p>
<p>William Holbrook, a spokesman for Irving, Texas-based
Exxon, referred Bloomberg News to the company''s employee
handbook. </p>
<p>Drug abuse is grounds for termination and outside
contractors are required to follow the same zero-tolerance
policy, according to the handbook. </p>
<p>Union shares fell 2 percent to close at $6.43 in New York.
The stock declined 14 percent in 2011 for its largest annual
drop since 2008. The company is 23 percent-owned by Metalmark
Capital LLC, a private-equity firm owned by Citigroup Inc. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE)''s market share for the
cholesterol pill Lipitor (PHAM1150), now at 41 percent after losing patent
protection last year, will decline further in the next five
months, according to generic-drug maker Watson Pharmaceuticals
Inc. (WPI) </p>
<p>Watson, producer of a Pfizer-authorized copy of Lipitor,
competes with a generic version made by India''s Ranbaxy
Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Watson and Ranbaxy entered the U.S. market
on Nov. 11, and have exclusive rights for 180 days before other
manufacturers can sell copies. </p>
<p>Paul Bisaro, Watson''s chief executive officer, today
revised a forecast he made last year that New York-based Pfizer
would hold onto 40 percent of the market once the copycats went
on sale. Pfizer gets revenue from Parsippany, New Jersey-based
Watson''s version. </p>
<p>Their ability to maintain that 40 percent will probably
erode, Bisaro said at an investor conference held by Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. in New York. History would indicate that it
would come down a little bit. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s share of the market was 41 percent as of Dec. 24
for the second week in a row, according to an report from
Bloomberg Industries. </p>
<p>Pfizer fell less than 1 percent to $21.60 at the close of
New York trading. Watson gained 2.8 percent to $61.99. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s largest
drugmaker, said it will incorporate its Indian subsidiary''s
animal health unit into its larger animal division, signaling
the company has progressed in its push to divest the business. </p>
<p>The action is a step toward worldwide consolidation of New
York-based Pfizer''s animal health operations under one roof, the
company said. The change was announced in a statement today by
the Bombay Stock Exchange. </p>
<p>Pfizer is shedding its animal health and nutrition
businesses this year as part of Chief Executive Officer Ian Read''s plan to focus on developing new drugs. The reorganization
will let potential buyers or investors assess the business unit
as a whole, said Scott Rostan, chief executive office of
Training the Street, a New York company that trains finance
professionals, and a former MA banker. </p>
<p>This is going to be part of the final stages of them
getting serious, Rostan said in a phone interview. This
would be a clear indication that they''re proceeding forward. </p>
<p>No decisions have been made as to whether the unit will be
sold, spun off or divested in some other way, said Joan Campion,
a Pfizer spokeswoman. </p>
<p>In order for any potential transaction with animal
health, in some countries the business needs to be separated out
from the legal entity that''s there, she said today in a
telephone interview </p>
<p>The animal health unit had $3.58 billion in sales in 2010.
Its Asian operations, of which the India subsidiary is part,
were responsible for 14 percent of that total, or about $500
million, according to a company presentation. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX)''s bid to protect assets
that could be seized as part of an $18 billion environmental
damages verdict against it in Ecuador was denied by a U.S.
judge, who said the request could be renewed at a later date. </p>
<p>Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, asked U.S.
District Judge Lewis Kaplan in New York to block the collection
of the judgment and the dissipating of any proceeds pending
resolution of a lawsuit alleging that the plaintiffs engaged in
fraud to win the Ecuadorean judgment. The company sought to
temporarily ensure the availability of all assets while the
U.S. case proceeds. </p>
<p>Chevron has made no effort to quantify the damages it
alleged has been sustained to date, let alone to support any
damage claim with evidence, Kaplan said in his ruling today. </p>
<p>Chevron was ordered on Feb. 14 to pay as much as
$18 billion in compensatory and punitive damages for Texaco
Inc.''s alleged dumping of toxic drilling wastes in the
Ecuadorean jungle from 1964 to about 1992. The ruling came in an
18-year-old lawsuit decided by a judge in Lago Agrio, a
provincial capital near the Colombian border. </p>
<p>Full Opinion </p>
<p>On Jan. 3, an Ecuadorean appeals court upheld the February
ruling in all of its parts, including the conviction for moral
reparation or its alternative and costs, according to the
decision. Chevron can appeal the decision to the next level of
Ecuador''s judiciary, a company spokesman said at the time. </p>
<p>A U.S. appeals panel in September rejected Kaplan''s March
decision blocking collection of the Ecuadorean judgment. The
appeals court hasn''t issued a full opinion in the matter. </p>
<p>Chevron denies wrongdoing in the Lago Agrio lawsuit. The
company says Texaco cleaned up its share of the pollution at its
former oil fields, which were taken over by PetroEcuador,
Ecuador''s state-owned oil company. Chevron says it was released
from any future liability by an agreement between Texaco and
Ecuador. Chevron acquired Texaco in 2001. </p>
<p>The San Ramon, California-based company alleged in a U.S.
suit before Kaplan that lawyers for the Ecuadoreans conspired to
fabricate evidence. Attorneys for the Latin American plaintiffs
said the lawsuit is an unjustified attempt to derail the
pollution lawsuit damages. </p>
<p>Narrow Grounds'' </p>
<p>Kent Robertson, a spokesman for Chevron, said in an e-mail
that we appreciate the court''s prompt response to our motion.
The court decided the motion on very narrow grounds and did not
question the strength of Chevron''s fraud evidence. Clearly the
court has left the door open to a future attachment filing. We
look forward to the balance of our racketeering case proceeding
and remain committed to holding the plaintiffs'' lawyers
accountable for their misconduct. </p>
<p>Karen Hinton, a U.S. spokeswoman for the Ecuadorean
plaintiffs, said in an e-mail that it is clear that Chevron''s
motion had no legal basis and was designed yet again to distract
attention from the company''s fraudulent misconduct in Ecuador as
well as its obligation to clean up its toxic waste in Ecuador''s
Amazon that threatens the lives of thousands of people. </p>
<p>The racketeering case is Chevron v. Donziger, 11-00691,
U.S. District Court, District of New York (Manhattan). The case
in Ecuador is Maria Aquinda v. Chevron, 002-2003, Superior Court
of Nueva Loja, Lago Agrio, Ecuador. </p>

<p>Stock prices are being increasingly
influenced by the trading of exchange-traded funds, with real
estate investment trusts as well as energy and consumer
companies most affected, according to a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
study. </p>
<p>REITs and energy companies accounted for eight of the top
10 firms in the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index whose trading volume
was most driven by trading in ETFs, Robert D. Boroujerdi, a
Goldman Sachs analyst, and three colleagues wrote in a paper
released today. Consumer retailers accounted for the five most
affected companies in the Russell 2000 Index, which tracks
small-capitalization stocks. </p>
<p>ETFs have come under increased scrutiny in the past two
years over whether their trading has increased market volatility
and correlation between individual stocks. The growing impact of
ETF trading on the price movements of individual stocks has
discouraged some companies from publicly listing, according to
Harold Bradley, chief investment officer at the nonprofit Ewing
Marion Kauffman Foundation, who testified in October before a
Senate subcommittee examining the impact of the products. </p>
<p>The Goldman Sachs analysis is aimed at showing investment
managers which sectors are most conducive to single-stock
selection and which are more macro bets, Boroujerdi, the New
York firm''s co-director of Americas equity research, said in an
e-mail. </p>
<p>ETF Assets Soar </p>
<p>ETFs, including exchange-traded notes and trusts, held
$1.54 trillion in assets worldwide at the end of November,
according to data compiled by New York-based BlackRock Inc. (BLK) </p>
<p>Correlation between the share prices of companies within
the same industry groups has increased as ETF assets and trading
volume have soared, the study said. Higher correlations indicate
that stock prices are rising or falling in tandem. </p>
<p>Global ETF assets rose 70 percent from the end of 2007
through November 2011, faster than mutual fund assets, which are
roughly in line with their 2007 levels, Goldman Sachs said,
citing data from the Investment Company Institute and BlackRock.
While equity ETFs have less than 10 percent of assets held by
their mutual-fund counterparts, they account for 25 percent to
30 percent of total equity dollar trading volume. That volume is
up from 10 percent to 15 percent in 2004, according to the
study. </p>
<p>Sector ETFs </p>
<p>ETF investors tend to concentrate their industry-focused
bets in relatively few products, according to the study. The 20
most heavily traded ETFs that invest in a specific industry
accounted for 85 percent of the total average daily value traded
among all U.S.-listed sector ETFs with assets of at least $100
million, Goldman Sachs said, citing data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Companies included in three of the four most actively
traded industry ETFs showed a higher correlation at the end of
2011 than during the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, the
study said. </p>
<p>The report examines the relationship between ETFs and
correlation on an industry group level and there is an
impact, Boroujerdi said in the e-mail. </p>
<p>Stage Stores, FMC </p>
<p>The Goldman Sachs analysts also estimated the impact of
ETFs on the trading volume of individual stocks. Smaller
companies were more affected. Among Russell 2000 companies,
three had more than 60 percent of their volume driven by ETF
trading, led by Houston-based retailer Stage Stores Inc. (SSI) at 66
percent. </p>
<p>Among SP 500 companies, Houston-based FMC Technologies
Inc. (FTI), an offshore-drilling technology firm, topped the list with
an estimated 23 percent of volume driven by ETF trades. </p>
<p>The study didn''t examine the impact from trading in
leveraged ETFs, which make use of derivatives to amplify their
bets, or those that are predominantly based in swaps, futures or
other non-single equity securities. </p>
<p>Almost all ETFs invest shareholder money in a basket of
stocks, bonds or commodities that tracks the performance of an
index. Unlike mutual funds, their shares trade throughout the
day on an exchange like stocks. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan
Stanley (MS), the major U.S. banks most reliant on trading, had their
earnings estimates reduced by analysts as a weak fourth quarter
dimmed prospects for a capital-markets rebound in the first half
of 2012. </p>
<p>Sanford C. Bernstein''s Brad Hintz cut his fourth-quarter
estimate for Goldman Sachs by 76 percent and almost quadrupled
his expected loss for Morgan Stanley as already anxious
clients grew increasingly cautious, he wrote in a note to
investors today. Doug Sipkin, an analyst at Ticonderoga
Securities LLC, lowered his 2012 Goldman Sachs estimate by 23
percent on a more pessimistic view of the firm''s fixed-income
trading revenue. </p>
<p>The two New York-based banks will probably still more than
double their earnings per share this year, according to analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. The firms'' 2011 results (GS) are likely to
fall short of estimates made at the start of last year on a
decline in trading volume, concern that the European debt crisis
would spread and one-time items such as preferred-share
redemptions. </p>
<p>We believe the threat emanating from Europe will dominate
customer activity, and we see little hope of any resolution in
the first half of the year, Hintz wrote. Regulatory concerns
and the overall pace of the global economic recovery pose
incremental headwinds for the large brokerage firms. </p>
<p>Through 2013 </p>
<p>JPMorgan (JPM) Cazenove analysts led by Kian Abouhossein cut
their earnings outlook for investment banks for 2011, 2012 and
2013, citing worsening conditions in fixed income and equities.
In a note today, the analysts lowered their Goldman Sachs 2012
estimate by 19 percent and Morgan Stanley''s figure by 17
percent. </p>
<p>Hintz reduced his fourth-quarter estimate for Goldman Sachs
to 77 cents a share, from $3.15, and Morgan Stanley to a loss of
75 cents, from a 19-cent loss. Sipkin dropped his Goldman Sachs
fourth-quarter estimate to 97 cents, from $4.12, and now expects
a 59-cent loss for Morgan Stanley, after previously estimating a
40-cent profit. </p>
<p>Fiona Swaffield, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote
in a note yesterday that she has cut her 2012 earnings estimates
for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley by 27 percent and 33
percent, respectively, since June. </p>
<p>Return on Equity </p>
<p>A lackluster estimated revenue increase has led to
concerns about the long-term return on equity investment banks
can produce, Swaffield wrote. Investment-banking divisions
likely had ROE of 5 percent to 9 percent in 2011, when measured
against risk-weighted assets calculated under new capital rules
known as Basel 3, she wrote. </p>
<p>The lowered earnings expectations didn''t change the
analysts'' stock ratings (GS). Abouhossein rates Goldman Sachs and
Morgan Stanley overweight. Hintz has an outperform
rating on both and wrote that current valuation levels imply a
near worst case scenario for these stocks. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein,
57, said in November that global growth will snap back
faster than most forecasters expect. He said he didn''t know when
that will happen. </p>
<p>Some analysts still see reason for optimism for a rebound
in investment-banking and trading revenue, which has likely
fallen in each of the past two years. In 2011, global stock
offerings plunged 29 percent from 2010 and U.S. bond issuance
fell 6.7 percent as companies delayed plans to raise capital,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Handful of Catalysts'' </p>
<p>We see a handful of catalysts -- like plenty of cash on
the sidelines, a pickup in MA activity, large investment-
banking backlogs and the need for hedge funds to try to
outperform their benchmarks, Glenn Schorr, an analyst at Nomura
Holdings Inc., wrote in a note today. That could boost
activity levels over the next few quarters. </p>
<p>If that pickup doesn''t occur, investment banks may chop
more jobs, Abouhossein said. Morgan Stanley said last month that
it''s eliminating 1,600 positions, and Goldman Sachs said in July
it would cut headcount (GS) by about 1,000. Staffing at U.S. and
European investment banks could fall 5 percent to 10 percent by
the second half of 2012, Abouhossein wrote. </p>
<p>The response of the banks to the lower revenue
environment has been less robust than we would have hoped to
date, Swaffield wrote. So far in 2011, headcount is down to
a limited extent versus 2007 pre-crisis, yet revenues are down
on average by a third. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the largest
publicly traded oil company, settled its lawsuit against U.S.
Interior Secretary Kenneth Salazar over the government''s
decision to cancel offshore leases that may yield billions of
barrels of oil. </p>
<p>The accord will allow ExxonMobil to develop this very
large, but technically challenging, resource as quickly as
possible using a phased approach, Patrick McGinn, a spokesman
for Irving, Texas-based Exxon, said in an e-mail yesterday. </p>
<p>Exxon sued Aug. 12 over a ruling by the department that
canceled Gulf of Mexico leases for the so-called Julia Unit. The
company and the government entered into settlement agreement on
Dec. 30, according to a filing yesterday in U.S. District Court
in Lake Charles, Louisiana. </p>
<p>Exxon said in its complaint that it sought a suspension for
its Julia leases in 2008 because of drilling complexity. It
cited federal regulations that allow oil oil producers to
suspend production in their fields, partly to facilitate
proper development of a lease. </p>
<p>The Interior Department denied the request in 2009, stating
that the companyhad not demonstrated a commitment to
production according to court papers. Unsuccessful appeals
followed. </p>
<p>Suspension of Production </p>
<p>As part of the settlement, the Interior Department granted
a suspension of production for the leases from Dec. 13, 2008, to
Oct. 31, 2013. The department will grant a second suspension
until Aug. 31, 2014, if Exxon and Statoil ASA (STL), a partner in
Exxon''s Julia fields, remains in compliance with the terms of
the agreement and takes certain steps toward production,
according to court documents. </p>
<p>Exxon and Statoil agreed to pay a yearly fee on the
original leases of $650 per acre until 87.5 million barrels of
oil are produced from the fields. The first fee will be owed for
2011, according to court documents. The minimum royalty rate for
the leases was increased to $11 per acre and the yearly rental
rate increased to $16 an acre. </p>
<p>The Julia project will play an important role in meeting
America''s energy demand, McGinn said in the e-mail. The
initial phase of the project is expected to produce more than
175 million barrels of oil through six production wells. </p>
<p>Melissa Schwartz, a spokeswoman for the Interior
Department, said in an e-mailed statement that the proposed
settlement affirms the regulatory process, provides incentives
for timely and thorough development of the leases, and secures a
fair return on those resources to the U.S. Treasury. </p>
<p>The case is Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Kenneth Salazar, 11-
CV-1474, U.S. District Court, Western District of Louisiana
(Lake Charles). </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS)''s chief legal officer,
Frank Barron, is leaving this year and will be succeeded by Eric Grossman, who was most recently global head of legal. </p>
<p>To ensure a seamless transition, I have asked Frank to
remain of counsel'' to the firm through mid-year, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said today in an internal
memo to employees. Frank will step down from the Operating
Committee but remain on the Management Committee until his
departure. Mark Lake, a spokesman for New York-based Morgan
Stanley, confirmed the memo''s contents. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, the sixth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
hired Barron, 60, in July 2010 after Gary Lynch, then the firm''s
chief legal officer, said he planned to leave. Grossman, 44, had
been a candidate for Lynch''s job before Barron, a litigation
partner at Cravath, Swaine  Moore LLP (1187L), joined the bank, a
person briefed on the matter said last year. Grossman joined
Morgan Stanley in 2006 and is a former partner at Davis Polk 
Wardwell (1149L). </p>
<p>Michael Stein, the Washington-based global head of
government relations, will report to Chief Operating Officer Jim Rosenthal instead of to Barron, according to the memo.
Rosenthal''s responsibilities include corporate communications
and community affairs, Gorman said in the memo. </p>
<p>Grossman worked in Davis Polk  Wardwell''s litigation
department, where he helped defend financial institutions
accused of violating securities laws, said Lynch, now Bank of
America Corp.''s head of legal, compliance and regulatory
relation. The two worked together at the law firm before Lynch
became Morgan Stanley''s chief legal officer, later hiring
Grossman. </p>
<p>Darryl Strawberry''s Agent </p>
<p>At Morgan Stanley, Grossman and Lynch worked together on
Morgan Stanley''s lawsuit over its separation agreement with
Discover Financial Services, which the bank spun off in 2007.
They also defended the lender in an almost $1.6 billion lawsuit
by financier Ron Perelman over the sale of Coleman Co. to one of
the firm''s clients, Lynch said in a phone interview. </p>
<p>Grossman also moonlighted as an agent for former Major
League Baseball player Darryl Strawberry shortly after he joined
Davis Polk  Wardwell in 1994, according to Robert Fiske, a
partner at the firm. </p>
<p>He has a very good ability to take a very difficult
complex situation and analyze it and figure out what are the
important issues that will come out of that, Fiske said in a
phone interview. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley is a client of Davis Polk  Wardwell, Fiske
said. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world''s largest

High Court. </p>
<p>Court papers didn''t give details on the content of
Microsoft''s claim against Motorola Mobility, which is being
acquired by Google Inc. (GOOG), maker of the Android operating system. </p>
<p>The suit was filed Dec. 23, three days after Microsoft won
a ruling before the U.S. International Trade Commission over
claims Android-based smartphones infringe Microsoft''s patents,
and two weeks after a hearing in Germany over similar claims
alleged by Microsoft against Motorola Mobility. </p>
<p>The ITC, which issued two findings on the matter last
month, said some features of Android phones use licensed
technology without permission, rulings which fell short of
Microsoft''s original broader claims that its inventions are
widely used in Android phones. Motorola Mobility General Counsel
Scott Offer said at the time that the majority of that ruling is
favorable to the handset maker and may provide clarity on what
Microsoft owns to avoid potential infringement. </p>
<p>Lacretia Taylor, a spokeswoman for Redmond, Washington-
based Microsoft, didn''t have an immediate comment on the U.K.
lawsuit. </p>
<p>Gemma Priscott and Jennifer Erickson, spokeswomen for
Motorola Mobility, didn''t immediately return calls for comment. </p>
<p>Google said Aug. 15 it would buy Libertyville, Illinois-
based Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion to obtain patents that
may be used to fend off suits targeting handsets and tablet
computers that use Android. Microsoft makes its own mobile-
operating system, Windows Phone 7, which competes with Android. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is staying
overweight on commodities as a rebound in demand revives
speculation of shortages, with gold a favorite for 2012 as
investors seek a hedge against Europe''s debt crisis. </p>
<p>Gold futures traded on the Comex in New York may climb to
$1,940 an ounce in 12 months as U.S. interest rates and
inflation are expected to remain low, Jeffrey Currie, head of
commodities research, said at the company''s Strategy Conference
2012 in London today, repeating the bank''s December forecast.
Gold has dropped 16 percent from a record in September. </p>
<p>Demand for gold strengthened most of last year as
Europe''s debt crisis widened and the U.S. Federal Reserve
pledged to keep interest rates near zero until at least mid-
2013. Low interest rates increase the appeal of bullion because
they generally reduce the prospect of returns on bonds. </p>
<p>Our view on gold is driven by our view on underlying real
interest rates, Currie said in an interview at the conference.
It is the sharp drop in price that makes it more attractive. </p>
<p>Gold futures for March delivery were unchanged at $1,616.80
an ounce at 5:11 p.m. in London. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley also named gold among its top picks in a
report e-mailed today, saying bullion may average a record
$2,200 an ounce. Gold prices are unlikely to move higher than
$1,940 unless there is a much weaker real rate environment
driven by inflation, which is not embedded in Goldman''s
forecast, Currie said. </p>
<p>Central Banks </p>
<p>Buying by central banks (001.046) will continue to support gold as
emerging markets banks continue to diversify their reserves,
Currie told the conference. Goldman also favors oil and copper
on supply constraints, Currie said. </p>
<p>The core of the commodities story is a supply-side
story, Currie said today. I don''t care how much demand China
may have for a commodity. If the world can produce enough of it,
I don''t want to be long. A long position is a bet on higher
prices. </p>
<p>Goldman correctly advised investors to sell oil and copper
in April and turned more bullish the next month before prices
rebounded. The Standard  Poor''s GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index
will return 15 percent in 12 months, Currie said </p>

<p>Patrick Lynch, the head of European
credit sales and trading at Morgan Stanley, (MS) was among a number
of departures at the bank in London, two people with knowledge
of the matter said. </p>
<p>Fernando Ortega, the head of emerging-market fixed-income
sales and trading, Amanda Webb on the securitization sales desk
and Janko Nedic, a salesman for collateralized loan obligations,
also left, two other people said separately. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, the sixth-biggest U.S. lender by assets,
said last month it planned to cut 1,600 jobs amid an
industrywide drop in revenue from investment banking and
trading. The figure amounts to about 2.6 percent of the New
York-based bank''s employees at the end of September, and the job
losses will take place in the first quarter at all levels. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley after 2008 really hasn''t come back, said
Jason Kennedy, the chief executive officer of London-based
recruiter the Kennedy Group. The big salaries are so high at
that level. They''ve got to thin out and they''re cleaning house
of the old regime. </p>
<p>Lynch didn''t reply to a text message to his cell phone.
Calls to Webb, Nedic and Ortega at Morgan Stanley''s offices
weren''t returned. </p>
<p>Sebastian Howell and Hugh Fraser, spokesmen for the U.S.
bank in London, declined to comment. </p>
<p>High-Yield Desk </p>
<p>Lynch, 42, moved to London from the bank''s high-yield desk
in New York to help build Morgan Stanley''s European distressed
debt group before the subprime crisis. He was relocated to Hong
Kong in 2007 to head the Asian corporate credit group, before
coming back to London in 2008. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s revenue from trading and investment-
banking dropped 36 percent in the third quarter from the
previous three months, excluding accounting adjustments. The
bank lost (MS) 34 percent of its market value since July 21, with its
shares ending last week at $15.90. </p>
<p>We will continue to see job cuts in the banking sector
this year as cost control will be one of the top priorities,
said Simon Adamson, an analyst at CreditSights Inc. in London.
Investment banking will be a high-risk area because it''s
facing cyclical pressure and a permanent shift in its business
model. </p>
<p>The cost of insuring Morgan Stanley''s debt more than
doubled in the same period, with credit-default swaps tied to
the lender jumping to 380 basis points, from 169, according to
CMA. The contracts climbed to a three-year high of 583 Oct. 3. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said U.S.
and Asian lenders will boost their share of commodity trade
financing as European banks curb loans, making disruptions in
the markets unlikely while traders'' borrowing costs may rise. </p>
<p>Jeffrey Currie, head of commodities research, commented
today in an interview in London. </p>
<p>Thus far there is not much evidence of significant market
disruptions due to a lack of trade credits in Asia and America.
The core of disruptions seems to be within the European Union.
The overall stock of trade credits is unlikely to change
significantly, only the ownership, as European banks exit these
businesses and sell them to the U.S. or Asian buyers. </p>
<p>Ultimately, after the transfers are completed, the
lasting impact is that it will likely cost more for commodity
operators to access this type of funding.'''' </p>
<p>On the impact of trade finance difficulties on different
markets: </p>
<p>Commodities are being impacted equally by the trade
finance problems, but the price reactions have been different.
This is because size of the impact relative to the market is
different and the underlying fundamental stories are different. </p>
<p>Oil has much tighter inventories and is a much larger
global market, so it''s not reacting to the same degree as the
smaller markets. Other markets, say copper or aluminum, were
much harder hit because they are smaller markets, more exposed
to Europe and they have higher inventory levels from which de-
stocking could occur.'''' </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said industrywide
sales of personal computers will probably be lower than analysts
had projected in the fourth quarter because supply was hurt by
flooding in Thailand. </p>
<p>Analysts have estimated that total PC shipments fell about
1 percent in the quarter, Tami Reller, chief financial officer
of Microsoft''s Windows unit, said an investment conference. The
actual number is probably lower, she said. Bill Koefoed,
Microsoft''s general manager of investor relations, echoed those
remarks at a separate event. </p>
<p>As the numbers come out, you''ll likely see that number
decline further as the impact has been felt faster than people
had anticipated, Koefoed said at a JPMorgan Chase  Co.
conference. Reller told the audience at a Nomura Holdings Inc.
event that there could potentially be more downward adjustments.
Both conferences were held in Las Vegas, where the Consumer
Electronics Show is under way. </p>
<p>Last year''s flooding in Thailand, which knocked disk-drive
factories off line, took a toll on a PC market that was already
suffering from competition with smartphones and Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s
iPad. Microsoft''s Windows sales have missed estimates in three
of the past four quarters. The comments today probably mean they
will fall short again, said Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at
Pacific Crest Securities. </p>
<p>Under Siege'' </p>
<p>The Windows business is under siege, said Barnicle, who
had estimated that PC shipments dropped 1 percent in the
quarter. He rates Microsoft shares sector perform. Windows
is their most profitable business. If that''s not stable for
whatever reason -- Thailand, Apple -- it just becomes difficult
for the stock to gain momentum. </p>
<p>Shares of Microsoft, the world''s largest software maker,
slipped 1.8 percent in extended trading after the comments were
reported. The stock had closed at $27.84 earlier today. </p>
<p>Microsoft is working to release a new operating system,
Windows 8, that''s designed to work on iPad-like tablets, helping
it compete with Apple. A public test version is set for
February, and Reller gave a preview last night during Chief
Executive Officer Steve Ballmer''s keynote address at the
Consumer Electronics Show. </p>
<p>The executives today declined to comment on when the final
version will go on sale. Analysts expect it later this year. </p>
<p>Intel Corp., the world''s biggest computer-chip maker, cut
its fourth-quarter revenue forecast by $1 billion last month,
citing the disk-drive shortages. </p>
<p>While drive manufactures are still working to recover, some
have bounced back faster than they had expected. Western Digital
Corp. (WDC), one of the harder-hit companies, has resumed production
and raised its quarterly revenue forecast. </p>
<p>Still, these types of shortages take time to go away,
Microsoft''s Reller said. </p>
<p>It tends to take a few quarters to work its way through
the system, she said. It would be naive to believe
otherwise. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chief Executive Officer
Ian Read said the company''s decision to sell or spin off its
animal and nutritional health units hasn''t reached a conclusion. </p>
<p>It is on track and we are happy with the way it is
going, Read said today during an interview at the J.P. Morgan
Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. He also said he had no
plans for a large acquisition. </p>
<p>Nestle SA (NESN), Danone, Abbott Laboratories and Heinz (HNZ) are among
potential buyers with nutrition lines of their own. Heinz has an
existing infant food business and no formula line, said Lee
Linthicum, an analyst with Euromonitor International. New York-
based Pfizer''s infant formula lines are also strong in the Asian
and Middle Eastern markets, where Danone (BN) and Nestle are weaker,
Linthicum said in a telephone interview last month. </p>
<p>The divestitures are part of Read''s plan to slim the
world''s largest drugmaker and focus on new medicines in the wake
of top-selling cholesterol pill Lipitor facing generic
competition last month. </p>
<p>Those plans don''t include another mega merger, Read
said. I''m very disinclined to be looking at any possibility of
a mega acquisition, he said. You never say never, but we
have all the science we need and we have the geographic
breadth. Instead, the company will look at mid-size bolt-
on deals. </p>
<p>Pfizer didn''t make any such purchases in 2011, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The largest was a $49.8 million
purchase of the company''s remaining stake in Icagen Inc. </p>
<p>Share Repurchases </p>
<p>Instead, the company authorized a $10 billion share
repurchase program. Read said the stock is undervalued, though
share buybacks are not a growth strategy. </p>
<p>Pfizer has been fighting to hang on to sales of Lipitor (PHAM1150)
during the 180-day period in which only Ranbaxy Laboratories
Ltd. (RBXY) and Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI) can sell the copycat
versions. In the last week of 2011, it had 41 percent of the
market for the drug, according to a report by Bloomberg
Industries. </p>
<p>It is playing out how we expected, Read said. The
company has made agreements with insurers to block sales of the
generics in return for rebates from Pfizer. The company has also
distributed cards to patients that offer a discounted copayment
at the pharmacy when they get the brand-name version of Lipitor. </p>
<p>Co-Pay Plan </p>
<p>There have been some hang-ups with the co-pay card plan,
Read said. Patients are encountering resistance when they go
to pharmacy with the card, he said. They have to be
insistent to get Pfizer''s brand-name version, he said. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s nutritionals unit sells prenatal vitamins and
infant formula worldwide. The nutritionals unit had $1.87
billion in 2010 revenue. The company is also divesting its $3.56
billion animal health unit. Both transactions will be announced
this year and completed from July 2012 to July 2013, said Joan Campion, a Pfizer spokeswoman. </p>
<p>Pfizer acquired the infant nutrition business as part of
its $68 billion takeover of Wyeth in 2009. Read is shedding the
units as part of his plan to slim down Pfizer and focus on
creating new drugs. </p>
<p>Nestle, Danone and Abbott (ABT) spoke to financial advisers about
the business, and were likely to bid, people with knowledge of
the process said in July. The people declined to be identified
because the talks are private. </p>
<p>Abbott Reaction </p>
<p>Abbott, of Abbott Park, Illinois, is separating its
pharmaceuticals business from one that includes medical devices,
nutritional products and generic drugs. Chief Financial Officer
Tom Freyman said today the split wouldn''t hamper merger and
acquisition efforts if a valuable prospect arose. </p>
<p>If there''s an opportunity that''s useful or valuable to
the company, certainly we would pursue it, Freyman told
investors today at the JPMorgan (JPM) conference. At this time there
isn''t anything of that nature out there that I''m in a position
to talk about today. </p>
<p>Freyman said he was aware Pfizer''s looking to divest its
nutritionals unit, and declined to comment further. </p>
<p>We''re happy with our business, Freyman said in an
interview today. I''ll leave it at that. </p>
<p>Pfizer gained less than 1 percent to $21.94 at 4 p.m. New
York time, and has increased 20 percent in the past 12 months.
Abbott rose less than 1 percent to $56.11, and is up 17 percent
in the last year. </p>

<p>We love the idea and we think that the benefits of making
the show available to more viewers outweigh the impact it might
have on ratings for the show, Paul Lee, president of ABC
Entertainment, said in an interview at a conference of TV
critics today in Pasadena, California. </p>
<p>ABC, which lags behind CBS in prime-time ratings,
previously showed full episodes of Modern Family and Last
Man Standing on the ABC.com website, Lee said. Initial viewer
numbers for those shows grew beyond the network''s projections,
he said. </p>
<p>The theatrical release will start in Los Angeles on Jan.
18, according to ABC. Later this month the episodes will appear
in cinemas in New York, Philadelphia and Austin, Texas. </p>
<p>The River is a one-hour drama that follows the story of
a wildlife expert who mysteriously goes missing while filming a
television show in the Amazon. His family and friends search for
him. </p>
<p>The show, from ABC Studios and Steven Spielberg''s
DreamWorks Television, is scheduled to begin airing on the
network starting Feb. 7. </p>
<p>Disney, based in Burbank, California, fell 0.3 percent to
$39.63 at the close in New York. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley said James Caron,
head of U.S. interest-rate strategy, has left the primary dealer
and his responsibilities will be assumed by Laurence Mutkin. </p>
<p>Mutkin, head of European fixed-income strategy in London,
will become global head of interest-rate strategy, according to
Sandra Hernandez, a New York-based spokeswoman at Morgan
Stanley. Mutkin has worked at the owner of the world''s largest
brokerage since February 2006. </p>
<p>Caron, 42, joined Morgan Stanley in July 2006 from Merrill
Lynch  Co., where he worked as head of cross-rates strategy,
generating trading ideas for U.S. and foreign government bonds
and derivatives. Caron, who was based in New York, did not
immediately return calls requesting comment. </p>
<p>In a Nov. 23 telephone interview, Caron said the Federal
Reserve would begin purchasing mortgage securities as soon as
June because fiscal policy makers would be unable to agree on
programs to boost the economy. Morgan Stanley is one of the 21
primary dealers that trade directly with the central bank. </p>
<p>Fed officials can only urge fiscal policy makers to do
the right thing, Caron said. If fiscal policy makers screw
it up, then that just means the Fed has to be more aggressive in
terms of what they''re doing. </p>
<p>Greater Communication </p>
<p>Caron forecast in a Dec. 8 note to clients that the Fed
would step up efforts to communicate its intention to keep
monetary policy accommodative further into the future in order
to spur growth and inflation. Our core view is that the Fed
will act aggressively to ease financial conditions in the months
ahead, he wrote. </p>
<p>After Morgan Stanley began 2010 with a forecast that the
U.S. economy would strengthen, lead to private credit demand,
higher stock prices and diminish the refuge appeal of
Treasuries, pushing 10-year yields to 5.5 percent, Caron
apologized to clients in a note published Aug. 19, 2010. The 10-
year yield was 2.58 percent at the time. </p>
<p>Caron has undergraduate degrees in physics and aeronautical
engineering from Bowdoin College in Maine and California
Institute of Technology, and a Master of Business Administration
from New York University. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and
Citigroup Inc. (C) are planning to market about $1 billion of bonds
backed by commercial property loans as soon as next week as
demand for the debt recovers amid optimism the U.S. economy can
withstand Europe''s fiscal crisis. </p>
<p>The deal will probably be the first of its kind for 2012,
according to people familiar with the offering, who declined to
be identified because the transaction hasn''t been announced. The
New York-based banks last sold similar debt in September, when
they issued $1.7 billion in securities tied to shopping malls,
hotel and office mortgages, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Banks pulled back from making new loans to package into
bonds in July as Europe''s debt crisis roiled credit markets and
sent relative yields soaring. Originations have since picked up,
according to a Standard  Poor''s report last month. The ratings
company is forecasting $35 billion in 2012 sales. </p>
<p>Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York,
declined to comment. Scott Helfman of Citigroup, also in New
York, declined to comment. </p>
<p>The extra yield investors demand to own top-ranked
commercial-mortgage bonds rather than Treasuries has declined 85
basis points to 238 basis points since Oct. 4, when it rose to a
20-month high, according to Barclays Capital CMBS AAA Super
Duper Index. The spread expanded from the 2011 low of 178 basis
points, or 1.78 percentage points, in April. </p>
<p>Despite global concerns, people are ready for a new
deal, said Ed Shugrue, CEO of New York-based commercial mortgage
bond investor and special servicer Talmage LLC. The market
wants to transact. </p>
<p>Attracting New Buyers </p>
<p>Bankers have retooled offerings sold since August by
boosting investor protection on the safest classes and
registering the debt with the Securities and Exchange Commission
to attract new buyers after demand shriveled amid the spreading
European debt turmoil. The AAA portion of the Goldman/Citigroup
deal should move briskly, Shugrue said, speaking in an
interview at the Commercial Real Estate Finance Council''s annual
convention in Miami. </p>
<p>Bank forecasts for commercial-mortgage bond sales in 2012
range from Wells Fargo Securities LLC predicting $25 billion to
UBS AG and Credit Suisse Group AG estimating as much as $45
billion. Wall Street banks arranged about $28 billion of the
debt last year, compared with $11.5 billion in 2010, Bloomberg
data show. Issuance peaked at $232 billion in 2007, the data
show. </p>
<p>The slowdown in lending was visible in the third quarter
last year as fewer loans paid off than in the first two
quarters, Standard  Poor''s said in a Dec. 19 report. About 56
percent of loans paid off at maturity in the third quarter, down
from more than 67 percent in the prior three-month period,
according to the New York-based rating company. A lack of new
sales chokes off funding to borrowers with debt coming due. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp., the world''s largest
software maker, sued Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. (MMI) in London''s
High Court. </p>
<p>Court papers didn''t give details on the content of
Microsoft''s claim against Motorola Mobility, which is being
acquired by Google Inc. (GOOG), maker of the Android operating system. </p>
<p>The suit was filed Dec. 23, three days after Microsoft won
a ruling before the U.S. International Trade Commission over
claims Android-based smartphones infringe Microsoft''s patents,
and two weeks after a hearing in Germany over similar claims
alleged by Microsoft against Motorola Mobility. </p>
<p>The ITC, which issued two findings on the matter last
month, said some features of Android phones use licensed
technology without permission, rulings which fell short of
Microsoft''s original broader claims that its inventions are
widely used in Android phones. Motorola Mobility General Counsel
Scott Offer said at the time that the majority of that ruling is
favorable to the handset maker and may provide clarity on what
Microsoft owns to avoid potential infringement. </p>
<p>Lacretia Taylor, a spokeswoman for Redmond, Washington-
based Microsoft, didn''t have an immediate comment on the U.K.
lawsuit. </p>
<p>Gemma Priscott and Jennifer Erickson, spokeswomen for
Motorola Mobility, didn''t immediately return calls seeking
comment. </p>
<p>Google said Aug. 15 it would buy Libertyville, Illinois-
based Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion to obtain patents that
may be used to fend off suits targeting handsets and tablet
computers that use Android. Microsoft makes its own mobile-
operating system, Windows Phone 7, which competes with Android. </p>
<p>The case is Microsoft Corporation v. Motorola Mobility
Inc., case no. HC11C04536, High Court of London, Chancery
Division (London). </p>
<p>Yahoo!, Augme Patent Infringement Case Trial Date Set for 2013 </p>
<p>The jury trial in Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)''s patent infringement case
brought by mobile-marketing company Augme Technologies Inc. is
set for January 2013, according to an Augme announcement. </p>
<p>New York-based Augme sued Yahoo! in federal court in San
Francisco in November 2009, accusing the Sunnyvale, California
Internet company of infringing to patents related to web-page
functionality. In dispute are patents 6,594,691 and 7,269,636. </p>
<p>In November 2010 Yahoo asked the court to dismiss the case.
That was rejected by a magistrate judge in December of that
year. In September 2011 the magistrate judge issued a ruling on
the reach of the patent -- known as a Markman ruling -- that
Augme said is believed to be favorable to the company. </p>
<p>The case is Augme Technologies Inc. (AUGT) v. Yahoo Inc.,

<p>Texas AM Says It Will Consider How to Enforce 12th Man'' Mark </p>
<p>Texas AM University is in discussion with its lawyers over
a stunt that occurred at the National Football League playoff
game Jan. 8 between the Denver Broncos and Pittsburgh Steelers,
the Texas Tribune reported. </p>
<p>A man parachuted into the stadium with a 12th Man flag
trailing behind him, a trademark that is registered to the Texas
school, according to the Tribune. </p>
<p>The flag was seen during the broadcast and the university
objects to the use of its marks by others without authorization,
the newspaper reported. </p>
<p>The phrase, which refers to football fans as the 12th
Man, has previously been the subject of a dispute between the
school and the Seattle Seahawks NFL team, which was resolved by
a licensing agreement between the two entities, according to the
Tribune. </p>
<p>Corbis Acquires Product-Placement Consulting Firm NMA Group </p>
<p>Corbis Corp., the Seattle-based photo archive company owned
by Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) founder Bill Gates, acquired a Los Angeles-
based product placement agency. </p>
<p>According to a joint company statement issued yesterday,
the GreenLight media-licensing unit of Corbis has acquired Norm
Marshall  Associates, which is also known as NMA Group. </p>
<p>NMA, founded in 1979, has coordinated thousands of iconic
placements in film and television productions. The company
also does celebrity seeding, through which it places branded
products in the hands of various celebrities. </p>
<p>One of the companies for which it does celebrity-seeding
work is Dutch brewer Heineken NV. (HEIA) NMA says on its website that
it has seeded Heineken with Jeremy Renner, Bradley Cooper,
Ryan Reynolds, Ryan Kwanten, Ashton Kutcher, Mila Kunis,
Michelle Trachtenberg, Ian Somerhalder, John Krazinski and Chris
Pine. </p>
<p>Among the other companies with which NMA works are General
Motors Co., Motorola Inc. and Puma SE (PUM). </p>
<p>NMA will operate as an independent business unit of
GreenLight, Corbis said in the statement. Terms of the
transaction weren''t disclosed. </p>
<p>Yves St. Laurent''s Color Argument Supported by Legal Academics </p>
<p>Yves St. Laurent SAS/France has found a few friends in its
trademark battle with French shoe designer Christian Louboutin
SA over red soles for women''s shoes. </p>
<p>A group of 11 law school professors submitted a brief Jan.
3 to a federal appeals court on behalf of St. Laurent. </p>
<p>The professors argued that the protection of single colors
in fashion markets should be rejected in order to preserve
freedom of innovation and competition. </p>
<p>They are arguing that the choice of red soles for the St.
Laurent shoes was an aesthetic determination rather than an
indicator of source. If Louboutin had never existed, YSL would
have the same aesthetic reasons for choosing to use a red sole
on a red shoe, they said, noting that the case record
indicated that St. Laurent used red soles for some of its shoes
as an esthetic element long before Louboutin designed shoes. </p>
<p>Louboutin sued St. Laurent in federal court in Manhattan in
April, claiming the use of red shoe soles by St. Laurent
infringed its trademarks. The trial court rejected the
shoemaker''s request to bar St. Laurent shoes with red soles, and
Louboutin filed an appeal of that ruling in mid-October. </p>
<p>In November Tiffany  Co., the luxury jewelry company,
submitted a friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of Christian
Louboutin. </p>
<p>New York-based Tiffany, which packages its jewelry items in
distinctive robin''s-egg blue boxes, weighed in on Louboutin''s
behalf. In its filing, Tiffany noted that it has a registered
trademark for its Tiffany blue color. </p>
<p>The company argues that the lower court holding that a
single color for a fashion item can never be a valid trademark
is not supported by trademark law. </p>
<p>The case is Christian Louboutin SA v. Yves St. Laurent
America Inc, 11-3303, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit. </p>

<p>Woolworths Accused of Cloning Bottler''s Entire Product Line </p>
<p>Woolworths Holdings Ltd. (WHL) has become the target of a
campaign on one of Facebook Inc.''s pages following the
retailer''s adoption of a new line of soft drinks, South Africa''s
Times newspaper reported. </p>
<p>The owner of Frankie''s soft drinks, a bottler in South
Africa''s Natal region, claimed the retail giant cloned his
entire product range, according to the Times. </p>
<p>This happened after Frankie''s Mike Schmidt met with
Woolworths about carrying his products and was told they were
out of character for the chain, the Times reported. </p>
<p>Woolworths managing director Zyda Rylands told the Times
that her company hasn''t infringed any copyright, intellectual

<p>Elisa Blocks Pirate Bay Website Pending Finnish Court Appeal </p>
<p>Elisa Oyj (ELI1V), Finland''s largest wireless carrier by
subscribers, has temporarily blocked the Pirate Bay file-sharing
website to users by court order. </p>
<p>Elisa banned access to the website after receiving an
enforcement order related to a court ruling in October, the
Helsinki-based company said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.
The Helsinki District Court ruled against Elisa based on a
complaint by the local branch of the International Federation of
the Phonographic Industry, Elisa said. The company has appealed
the decision. </p>
<p>The Swedish-founded Pirate Bay site enables downloading of
digitized music and films using software called BitTorrent which
enables complete works to be assembled from pieces on other
users'' computers. Telenor ASA (TEL), Norway''s largest operator,
successfully argued in a Norwegian court in 2010 that the
company shouldn''t be ordered to block the website. </p>
<p>According to information received from the collection
authorities, we have to implement the measures requested until
the court case is completed, Henri Korpi, Elisa''s head of
consumer subscriptions business, said in the statement. </p>
<p>The parties should now concentrate on measures that would
really reduce piracy, Korpi said. That includes making
digital distribution available at a reasonable price and at the
same time as releases on other media. </p>
<p>The block affects users of both Elisa and Saunalahti
branded services in Finland and covers more than 30 Pirate Bay
domains. </p>
<p>The IFPI and the Copyright Information and Anti-Piracy
Center also filed blocking actions against TeliaSonera AB and
DNA Oy in Finland on Nov. 25, said Antti Kotilainen, executive
director of the anti-piracy center, which represents the IFPI in
defending the copyrights of major record companies in Finland. </p>
<p>Decisions in those cases are expected in February or March,
Kotilainen said. TeliaSonera, Elisa and DNA together account for
80 percent of broadband users in Finland, Kotilainen said. </p>
<p>Pirate Bay''s four founders were each sentenced to one year
in prison in 2009 by a Swedish court. Three of the men had their
jail sentences reduced on appeal in 2010. </p>

<p>Bank of New York Mellon Corp. and
federal prosecutors are close to settling some claims in a
government lawsuit accusing the bank of overcharging customers
for foreign-exchange trading, according to a court filing. </p>
<p>U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan requested a one-
week extension for BNY Mellon to respond to the complaint
because the two sides are presently close to reaching an
agreement that would resolve certain claims, according to
letter filed yesterday with U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan.
The judge granted the request, according to the court docket. </p>
<p>Bharara sued New York-based BNY Mellon on Oct. 4, the same
day the bank was sued by New York Attorney General Eric
Schneiderman for allegedly defrauding public pension funds of $2
billion over 10 years. Attorneys general in Virginia and Florida
and some California counties filed similar complaints. </p>
<p>The cases center on the pricing of small foreign-exchange
transactions handled automatically by the custody banks on
behalf of pension funds, a service known as standing
instruction. In some of the cases the banks have said they acted
as a principal, selling one currency for another in arms-length
transactions at a set price that customers were free to accept
or reject. </p>
<p>Kevin Heine, a spokesman for BNY Mellon, didn''t return a
phone call or e-mail seeking comment on the government''s court
filing after regular business hours. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.,
11-6969, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>
<p>Park City Eatery Balks at Credit Card Fines in Rare Court Fight </p>
<p>Stephen and Cissy McComb say they managed their Italian
eatery in Park City, Utah, for more than two decades without
running afoul of security rules of Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA)
-- until they were accused of mishandling data and opening the
door to $1.26 million in fraud. </p>
<p>The McCombs, who opened Cisero''s in 1985, are now in a
legal fight with the bank that processed their credit charges
and, indirectly, with what they say are card networks that
change rules without notice, impose unfair one-sided contracts
and allow the taking of money from merchants'' accounts with no
proof of fault, Bloomberg News''s Thom Weidlich reports. </p>
<p>The couple sued, saying they didn''t break MasterCard and
Visa rules, that there was no security lapse and that no acts of
fraud were specifically claimed. The fraud was conjured from
unexplained and unsupported data, they said in court papers
filed in state court in Park City. Their suit may be the first
court challenge to penalties under the card networks'' security
procedures, said one of their lawyers, W. Stephen Cannon. </p>
<p>The McCombs are in litigation against Elavon Inc., an
Atlanta-based payment-processing company, and US Bank. Both are
units of US Bancorp (USB), Minnesota''s largest bank. </p>
<p>US Bancorp is a middleman in Cisero''s credit business, out
of sight of customers who may be aware only of Visa, MasterCard
and the banks that issue the cards. </p>
<p>As the so-called acquiring bank, US Bank provided Cisero''s
with access to payment networks and maintained an account from
which it paid the restaurant for credit-card purchases, the
McCombs said. Elavon processed the payments. </p>
<p>The McCombs countersued in August after US Bancorp sued
them for $82,692 in fines imposed by Visa and MasterCard. </p>
<p>Teri Charest, a spokeswoman for US Bancorp, said in an e-
mail that the bank denied any liability will fight the lawsuit. </p>
<p>Denise Dunckel, a spokeswoman for San Francisco-based Visa,
and James Issokson, a spokesman for Purchase, New York-based
MasterCard, declined to comment on the lawsuit. Their companies
aren''t defendants in the case. </p>

<p>Wall Street Groups Seek Delay of CFTC Position Limits Rule </p>
<p>Two Wall Street groups asked a federal appeals court to
delay a U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission rule that
limits commodity speculation, saying the regulation is already
imposing irreversible harms. </p>
<p>The International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc.
and Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association filed
an emergency request yesterday in Washington urging a three-
judge panel to put the rule on hold while the court considers
their legal challenge. The groups asked the court to issue a
ruling by Jan. 27. </p>
<p>The rule will force market participants to forgo
efficient trading strategies, impair their ability to hedge
against risks, and potentially require them to restructure their
businesses, the groups said in the filing. These costs will
mount now absent a stay, and they would be impossible to recoup
if the rule is invalidated -- as it likely will be. </p>
<p>The groups, in one of the financial industry''s highest-
profile efforts to weaken last year''s Dodd-Frank law, filed
lawsuits challenging the rule in two federal courts in
Washington last month. </p>
<p>They argue that the CFTC used a flawed analysis of Dodd-
Frank when it decided to impose the restrictions. The
associations also said the CFTC failed to properly weigh the
rule''s costs and benefits. </p>
<p>In yesterday''s filing with the U.S. Court of Appeals, the
groups argue that their challenge will likely succeed, noting
that a majority of commissioners concluded the rule was
unnecessary and would have rejected it but for one
commissioner''s mistaken view that Congress required it. </p>
<p>They said the rule will impose costs on the economy because
some companies may not invest in other companies as a way of
avoiding the aggregation requirements. </p>
<p>Steven Adamske, a CFTC spokesman, declined to comment on
the filing. </p>

<p>Banks Blame Countrywide for U.K. Mortgage Losses in 97 Suits </p>
<p>Suninder Sandha bought his luxury apartment in Coleorton
Hall, a 19th century country mansion near Leicester in central
England, using a 1.2 million-pound loan ($1.86 million) from
Barclays Plc (BARC) in 2005. </p>
<p>When the property market collapsed two years later, Sandha
couldn''t make his mortgage payments and Barclays seized the
apartment, selling it for 500,000 pounds. The lender has now
sued Countrywide Plc (CWD), whose surveying unit valued it at the peak
of the boom, for its losses, according to court papers,
Bloomberg News'' Kit Chellel reports. </p>
<p>The suit is one of 38 filed last year in London''s High
Court against Countrywide, the nation''s largest residential
property broker, by lenders including Barclays, Lloyds Banking
Group Plc (LLOY) and GMAC-RFC. That''s more claims than any of the four
largest U.K. banks faced in 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. As many as 97 lawsuits have been filed since 2007
against Countrywide, bought that year by private-equity firm
Apollo Management LP. </p>
<p>These banks have incurred huge losses and they are
looking for someone to blame, said Alexandra Anderson, a
partner at law firm Reynolds Porter Chamberlain LLP representing
surveyors including Countrywide. Often the blame is
themselves, and the lending practices they had. </p>
<p>Countrywide, now also owned by Oaktree Capital Management
LLC (OAKTRZ) and Alchemy Partners LLP, said in an e-mailed statement it
had seen a considerable increase in professional negligence
claims, particularly from now-defunct lenders. </p>
<p>We will continue to defend our position when we believe
we have fulfilled our responsibilities, Countrywide said. If
an error is made, then we do seek to settle with claimants. </p>
<p>The London company isn''t affiliated with Countrywide
Financial Corp., the Calabasas, California-based subprime lender
acquired by Bank of America Corp. in 2008. </p>
<p>Barclays spokeswoman Emma Austin declined to comment on its
lawsuit. U.K. telephone directories online didn''t list an
address for Sandha since he left Coleorton Hall and the lawsuit
didn''t provide details of where he is now. Apollo spokesman
Charles Zehren declined to comment. </p>

<p>Trials/Appeals </p>
<p>Clean Water Act Tool Used by EPA Questioned at High Court </p>
<p>U.S. Supreme Court justices voiced concern that the
Environmental Protection Agency is overreaching in enforcing
federal statutes, signaling that they may blunt a favorite
agency enforcement tool. </p>
<p>Hearing arguments yesterday in a case involving an Idaho
couple seeking to build a new home, the justices suggested they
are likely to rule that people accused by federal regulators of
violating environmental laws have a right to immediately take
their case to a federal judge. </p>
<p>The case, which has with ramifications for energy companies
and manufacturers, may weaken the EPA''s so-called administrative
compliance orders. The agency issues as many as 3,000 such
orders each year to businesses and individuals, demanding an end
to alleged environmental violations and applying so much
pressure that those accused typically give in before the agency
has to justify the action before a judge. </p>
<p>The fight involves a 0.63-acre property near the banks of
Priest Lake in northern Idaho. In 2007 Chantell and Michael
Sackett had begun preparing the land to build a three-bedroom
home, when EPA officials ordered work to halt. The agency said
that the property was a wetland and that the Sacketts couldn''t
build without obtaining a permit under the Clean Water Act. </p>
<p>The EPA then ordered the Sacketts to restore the land by
removing piles of fill material and replanting the vegetation
they had cleared. The written order threatened the couple with
fines of as much as $32,500 a day. </p>
<p>The Sacketts contend they have a constitutional right to
seek judicial review of that administrative compliance order
right away. A federal appeals court said the couple had to wait
until regulators sought to enforce the order by asking a federal
court to impose a fine. </p>
<p>The Obama administration and the EPA argue that the couple
has ample avenues short of going to court for contesting the
order without risking fines. Among other options, the Sacketts
could apply for a permit, the government said. </p>
<p>Justices from across the ideological spectrum yesterday
questioned the adequacy of those options and the government''s
contention that Congress didn''t authorize judicial review of
administrative compliance orders. </p>
<p>The case is Sackett v. EPA, 10-1062, U.S. Supreme Court
(Washington). </p>

<p>JJ (JNJ) Opposes Texas in $1 Billion Risperdal Marketing Trial </p>
<p>Johnson  Johnson, which has lost judgments of almost $660
million over the marketing of its antipsychotic drug Risperdal,
began a trial yesterday in which Texas is seeking damages of
more than $1 billion. </p>
<p>State Attorney General Greg Abbott accused JJ of paying
officials to get Risperdal on approved drug lists, marketing it
for unapproved uses to children and the elderly, and lying about
its effects. The case in state court in Austin was filed by a
whistle-blower and joined by the state, which is seeking
repayment of Medicaid payments. </p>
<p>Texas is asking for reimbursement of $579 million, said Tom
Melsheimer, a lawyer for the whistle-blower. The amount could be
tripled by jurors under state law. In addition, jurors will
decide the number of violations and set a penalty of as much as
$10,000 apiece, if the state wins. </p>
<p>It''s going to be massive, said Patrick Burns of the
advocacy group Taxpayers Against Fraud. They''ll lose in Texas,
and then they''re going to face litigation from stockholders for

<p>The result may be a record false-claims verdict, Burns said
by phone from Washington. </p>
<p>A jury weighing only the claim that the company downplayed
the drug''s risks awarded Louisiana $257.7 million in 2010. A
judge in South Carolina last year ordered JJ to pay $327
million over Risperdal sold in the state. </p>
<p>JJ and its Janssen unit, which sold Risperdal, deny any
wrongdoing. </p>
<p>We are committed to ethical business practices, and have
policies in place to ensure that our products are only promoted
for their FDA-approved indication, Teresa Mueller, a JJ
spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. The company will fight the
allegations, she said. </p>
<p>Jury selection in Austin started yesterday. The trial is
scheduled to last about three weeks. </p>

<p>CVC Didn''t Know of F1 Payments to Gribkowsky, Court Told </p>
<p>CVC Capital Partner Ltd.''s managing partner told a Munich
court he wasn''t informed about payments made to former
Bayerische Landesbank Chief Risk Officer Gerhard Gribkowsky over
the 2005 sale of Formula One racing. </p>
<p>Donald MacKenzie, who testified at Gribkowsky''s bribery
trial in Munich yesterday, said he and CVC only heard about the
issue when the German press reported it a year ago. MacKenzie
said Formula One Chief Executive Officer Bernie Ecclestone first
told him he didn''t know about the payments before explaining
them at a Feb. 2 meeting. </p>
<p>Prosecutors charged Gribkowsky, who managed Munich-based
BayernLB''s interest in Formula One, with accepting bribes,
breach of trust and tax evasion. They claim he received $44
million in bribes to facilitate the sale of the bank''s 47
percent stake in Formula One to CVC. </p>
<p>Gribkowsky demanded $50 million from Ecclestone as a reward
for consenting to the deal and threatened to disclose possible
tax violations by the Bambino family trust run by Ecclestone''s
wife at the time, prosecutors said. Gribkowsky denies the
charges. </p>
<p>MacKenzie testified he wasn''t informed about a separate
agreement under which Ecclestone would get $100 million. While
it may have been a breach of the Formula One sales agreement not
to disclose it, arrangements in which shareholders pay
executives an incentive are common, said MacKenzie. </p>
<p>Had I known about it at the time, I would have understood
it, he said. We would have renegotiated the terms of the
deal, though, and that would have delayed it. </p>

<p>Potential Suits </p>
<p>MF Global U.K. Administrators Threaten Client Money Lawsuits </p>
<p>Administrators at MF Global Holdings Ltd (MFGLQ).''s U.K. unit said
they have threatened to sue large financial institutions who
were unwilling to release money they held for the failed
broker''s clients. </p>
<p>Some companies have a number of positions across the
group and they are generally hesitant to hand over
unsegregated funds worth a total of more than 1 billion pounds
($1.5 billion), Richard Heis, the lead administrator at KPMG
LLP, told MF Global clients and creditors at a meeting in London
yesterday. </p>
<p>While administrators had encountered few problems
persuading outside institutions to release segregated funds,
which are protected, unsegregated accounts were tied up because
of legal arguments about potential set-off, Heis said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK),
Citigroup Inc. and LCH.Clearnet Group Ltd. were among the
depository institutions holding cash and assets for MF Global
customers, according to documents released by KPMG. </p>
<p>MF Global Holdings Ltd., based in New York, was the fifth-
largest financial company to file for bankruptcy when it sought
protection on Oct. 31 after making losing bets on European
sovereign debt. KPMG was appointed to supervise the special
administration of the broker''s London unit. </p>
<p>Spokesmen for JP Morgan, Citigroup, LCH and BNY Mellon

<p>New Suits </p>
<p>Corzine Sued by Montana Farmers Over Futures Account Money </p>
<p>Jon Corzine, former chief executive officer of collapsed
commodity brokerage MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ), was sued for fraud
by Montana farmers who claim he oversaw the misappropriation of
their commodity trading account funds. </p>
<p>The lawsuit filed yesterday by three farmers and a cattle-
raising operation in Montana seeks to represent a nationwide
group of commodities futures customers whose money went missing
amid the $41 billion bankruptcy of MF Global, parent of the
futures brokerage that is being liquidated. A trustee is looking
for $1.2 billion or more in money missing from commodity
customers'' accounts. </p>
<p>Corzine, the former governor of New Jersey, and other
executives at MF Global made knowingly false statements to
induce the plaintiffs to enter into contracts with the
brokerage, according to the complaint filed in federal court in
Missoula, Montana. </p>
<p>The executives failed to disclose to customers that their
money was used to finance MF Global''s bad bets on European
sovereign debt, the farmers said in the complaint. </p>
<p>The lawsuit also names JPMorgan Chase  Co., MF Global''s
clearing broker and custodian, as a defendant, alleging it
failed to detect suspicious activity at the brokerage and aided
and abetted in the fraud. </p>
<p>Corzine has said he doesn''t know where the missing money is
and didn''t authorize any misuse of customer funds that may have
occurred. Corzine is the defendant in at least nine lawsuits
before a federal judge in Manhattan that seek compensation for
losses from the company''s bankruptcy, according to court papers. </p>
<p>Mary Sedarat, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to comment
on the lawsuit. Steven Goldberg, a spokesman for Corzine, didn''t
return an e-mail seeking comment about the complaint. </p>
<p>The case is Klinker v. JPMorgan Chase., 12-0005, U.S.
District Court, District of Montana (Missoula). </p>
<p>Olympus Sues President, 18 Other Executives Over Fraud </p>
<p>Olympus Corp. (7733) said it is seeking damages from its
president, Shuichi Takayama, and 18 other current and former
executives over their roles in a $1.7 billion cover-up of
losses. </p>
<p>The Japanese camera maker''s auditors filed the claims at
the Tokyo District Court on Jan. 8, Olympus said in a statement
yesterday. The company''s shares surged as much as 28 percent on
investor optimism that it would keep its listing on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange that had been under threat because of the fraud. </p>
<p>Olympus managers involved in the scheme to hide investment
losses over more than a decade caused 86 billion yen ($1.1
billion) in damages to the company, according to the findings of
an independent panel released yesterday. Former President
Michael Woodford, who was fired after he challenged the board on
takeover and accounting practices, is also taking legal action
against the company over his dismissal. </p>
<p>It''s all part of the natural fallout to be expected with
each party trying to stake their positions and to protect their
legal interests, Eugene Tan, assistant professor of law at the
Singapore Management University, said yesterday following
Japanese media reports that the lawsuits had been filed. We''ll
see suits and countersuits taking place in the next couple of
weeks, if not months. </p>
<p>The company is seeking as much as 3.6 billion yen ($46.8
million) in damages from executives including ex-Chairman
Tsuyoshi Kikukawa, it said. Takayama, who took over after
Woodford, is being sued for as much as 500 million yen, the
company said in a statement yesterday. </p>
<p>Former company auditor, Hideo Yamada, and Hisashi Mori,
fired as executive director over his role, are being sued for
3.01 billion yen and 2.81 billion yen, respectively, it said. </p>
<p>Olympus spokesmen weren''t immediately available to comment,
and repeated attempts since the scandal broke to contact
officials involved, including visits to their homes, have
failed. </p>
<p>The company inflated fees to advisers on the $2.1 billion
acquisition of Gyrus Group Plc in 2008 and overpaid in
purchasing three Japanese companies with the intention of
increasing goodwill, the independent panel investigating the
fraud said last month. </p>

<p>Verdicts/Settlements </p>
<p>Ex-CDR Financial Executives Plead Guilty in Fraud Case </p>
<p>Former CDR Financial Products Inc. Chief Financial Officer
Z. Stewart Wolmark and Vice President Evan Zarefsky pleaded
guilty in a multimillion dollar scheme to rig municipal bond
investments. </p>
<p>The pleas yesterday before U.S. District Judge Victor
Marrero in federal court in New York came a week before opening
arguments were scheduled to be heard in a trial over alleged
bid- and auction-rigging in the municipal bond market. CDR
founder and former chief executive officer David Rubin and his
Beverly Hills, California-based firm pleaded guilty on Dec. 30. </p>
<p>Wolmark, 56, admitted in court yesterday to manipulating
bids during his tenure at CDR from 1998 to November 2006. </p>
<p>During that period I participated with others in an
agreement to allocate and rig bids, he said. I also
knowingly participated in an agreement with others to manipulate
the bids in return for inflated fees paid to CDR, he said. </p>
<p>CDR was hired by public entities that issue municipal bonds
to act as their broker and conduct what were to be competitive
bidding process for contracts for the investment of municipal
bond proceeds, according to prosecutors. Instead, CDR employees
allegedly took kickbacks for running sham auctions for the
investments. </p>
<p>Wolmark and Zarefsky, 37, each pleaded guilty to two counts
of conspiracy and one count of wire fraud. They face as long as
35 years in prison on all counts, the judge said. </p>
<p>Zarefsky told Marrero that soon after he joined CDR in
April 2000, he became involved in the conspiracy. </p>
<p>I knew that it was wrong but then later I subsequently
came to understand that it was unlawful, Zarefsky said. </p>
<p>Sharis Pozen, Acting Assistant Attorney General in charge
of the Justice Department''s Antitrust Division said, Our
investigation into the municipal bond derivatives industry has
now led to guilty pleas by 12 financial executives and charges
against six others. </p>
<p>In court, Michael G. McGovern, a lawyer for Wolmark, and
Daniel L. Zelenko, a lawyer for Zarefsky, told the judge they
disputed the length of the sentences their clients face as
calculated by the government. </p>

<p>Ex-Trader David Slaine Helped Lead to Rajaratnam, U.S. Says </p>
<p>David Slaine, a former Galleon Group LLC employee who
pleaded guilty to criminal charges, was crucial to the
prosecution of Zvi Goffer''s insider-trading ring and helped lead
investigators to Raj Rajaratnam and Primary Global Research LLC,
U.S. prosecutors said. </p>
<p>Slaine wore a wire to record dozens of conversations with
Goffer and others, helping to spur what became the biggest probe
of insider trading at hedge funds, prosecutors from the office
of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan said yesterday in a
letter to U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan. Calling Slaine''s
cooperation nothing short of extraordinary, the government
asked for leniency when he''s sentenced. </p>
<p>Evidence gathered by Slaine played a role in, among other
things, the successful prosecution of Raj Rajaratnam and his co-
conspirators, as well as the defendants in the Primary Global
Research case, according to the letter. His assistance was
the launching point for many successful and ongoing criminal
investigations of multiple insider trading networks. </p>
<p>Slaine, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy and securities
fraud in December 2009, testified at the trial of Goffer, his
brother Emanuel Goffer and Michael Kimelman that he cooperated
with federal agents for about 2 1/2 years to try to avoid
prison. </p>
<p>Slaine faces as long as 25 years in prison when he''s
sentenced. </p>
<p>A co-founder of Galleon Group, Rajaratnam reported to
Federal Medical Center Devens in Ayer, Massachusetts, last month
to begin an 11-year prison sentence. He was convicted by a
federal jury in May of 14 counts of conspiracy and securities
fraud for trading on inside information. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Goffer, 10-cr-00056, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Ex-Refco Lawyer Collins''s Conviction Thrown Out on Appeal </p>
<p>The conviction of Joseph Collins, Refco Inc. (RFXCQ)''s former
outside lawyer, was reversed by an appeals court that found the
trial judge improperly instructed a juror outside the presence
of his lawyers. </p>
<p>Collins, convicted in 2009 of aiding Refco''s former chief
executive officer Phillip Bennett and other executives defraud
investors of $2.4 billion, is entitled to a new trial, a three-
judge panel of the New York-based federal appeals court said in
a ruling yesterday. </p>
<p>Collins was convicted of five of 14 criminal counts against
him, including two counts of wire fraud, two counts of
securities fraud and one count of conspiracy. Jurors were unable
to reach a verdict on the other nine counts. During
deliberations in the case, jurors told the judge that there had
been threats of violence in the jury room, with one juror
threatening to cut off the finger of another one. </p>
<p>We cannot say with fair assurance that the judgment was
not substantially swayed by the district court''s errors in this
case, U.S. Circuit Judge Denny Chin wrote in an opinion
yesterday. </p>
<p>After this long fight, we are very gratified by the Court
of Appeals'' decision, William Schwartz, a lawyer for Collins,
said in an e-mailed statement. Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for
the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan, declined to comment on the
ruling. </p>
<p>Collins, a former corporate lawyer with the Chicago firm
Mayer Brown LLP (1120L), was accused of helping Refco''s management
conceal transactions from lenders and investors that hid losses
incurred by the New York-based firm. He was sentenced to seven
years in prison. </p>

Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Litigation Departments </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS)''s Grossman Succeeds Barron as Chief Legal Officer </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s chief legal officer, Frank Barron, is
leaving this year and will be succeeded by Eric Grossman, who
was most recently global head of legal. </p>
<p>To ensure a seamless transition, I have asked Frank to
remain of counsel'' to the firm through mid-year, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said yesterday in an
internal memo to employees. Frank will step down from the
Operating Committee but remain on the Management Committee until
his departure. Mark Lake, a spokesman for New York-based
Morgan Stanley, confirmed the memo''s contents. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, the sixth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
hired Barron, 60, in July 2010 after Gary Lynch, then the firm''s
chief legal officer, said he planned to leave. Grossman, 44, had
been a candidate for Lynch''s job before Barron, a litigation
partner at Cravath, Swaine  Moore LLP, joined the bank, a
person briefed on the matter said last year. Grossman joined
Morgan Stanley in 2006 and is a former partner at Davis Polk 
Wardwell. </p>
<p>News Corp. (NWSA) Hires Williams  Connolly''s Zweifach as Top Lawyer </p>
<p>News Corp., embroiled in a hacking scandal that saw it
shutter one of its U.K. newspapers in July, hired Gerson
Zweifach, a partner with law firm Williams  Connolly LLP, as
group general counsel. </p>
<p>Zweifach, 58, will be a senior executive vice president,
reporting to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rupert
Murdoch, the New York-based company said yesterday in a
statement. </p>
<p>We are fortunate to have such a renowned attorney join
our company as we navigate the rapidly changing media
landscape, Murdoch said in the statement. </p>
<p>Zweifach, who has worked at Washington-based Williams 
Connolly for almost 30 years managing antitrust and libel cases,
succeeds Lawrence Jacobs, who left in June to pursue other
opportunities. Janet Nova, a board member of the News
International unit, who served as interim general counsel for
the past six months, will remain with the company. </p>
<p>As top legal officer, the new general counsel will probably
become point person for News Corp.''s handling of the phone-
hacking scandal which led to the closing of the company''s News
of the World tabloid in the U.K. and at least 21 arrests. Board
member Joel Klein, a former federal prosecutor, is overseeing
the company''s internal probe of its newspaper journalists''
actions. </p>
<p>Hong Kong Law Firm Deacons Plans Independent Expansion in China </p>
<p>Deacons, Hong Kong''s oldest law firm, plans to remain
independent as it prepares for the expansion of its three
offices in China when rules are changed to let overseas firms
advise on local laws. </p>
<p>We want to replicate our Hong Kong capabilities on the
mainland when regulations permit, Deacons Executive Partner
Jeremy Lam said in a Jan. 4 interview. Lam said he hopes Hong
Kong firms such as Deacons will be allowed to advise on Chinese
law within the next five years. </p>
<p>Deacons, founded in 1851 in what was then a British colony,
was the first non-Chinese law firm to be allowed a third
representative office on the mainland in 2005, eight years after
Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule. China has given law firms
from the city, which retains a separate legal system,
preferential access to the country. </p>
<p>While Deacons has been approached by U.S. law firms Lam
declined to identity, it isn''t discussing strategic alliances
with anyone and is pursuing a strategy of independence, he said. </p>
<p>That contrasts with other Hong Kong firms such as Johnson
Stokes  Master which has merged with Chicago-based Mayer Brown
LLP to form the Asian city''s largest law firm with 201 fee
earners, according to trade publication Asia Legal Business. </p>
<p>In other mergers, Arculli Fong  Ng combined with Beijing-
based King  Wood''s Hong Kong office in 2009, and that
partnership will merge with the Hong Kong office of Australia''s
Mallesons Stephen Jaques to have more than 130 lawyers. </p>
<p>Deacons, with 191 lawyers in Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Beijing
and Shanghai, ended alliances with San Francisco-based Graham 
James LLP in 2000 and with the 600-lawyer Australian firm
formerly known as Sly  Weigall in 2009. </p>
<p>The Hong Kong firm ended its remaining alliances with firms
in Taiwan, Malaysia and Thailand at the end of last year, Lam
said. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. energy company, said fourth-quarter profit was
significantly below third-quarter results after maintenance
work at a California refinery and the sale of a U.K. plant
curbed fuel output. The shares fell more than 2 percent. </p>
<p>Profit from the company''s oil and natural-gas wells was
comparable with third-quarter performance, the San Ramon,
California-based company said in a statement today. Chevron''s
refining business was near break even, according to the
statement. </p>
<p>The company''s U.S. refineries processed 18 percent less
crude during October and November than during the final three
months of 2010 because of maintenance work that idled part of a
California refinery, Chevron said. Processing rates at overseas
plants slumped 24 percent during the same period after the
August sale of a Welsh refinery to Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) </p>
<p>Chevron dropped $2.22, or 2.1 percent, to $105.55 at 5:23
p.m. after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Before today, the stock had gained 21 percent in the past year.
Chevron rose 17 percent in 2011, the second-largest increase in
the NYSE Arca Oil index after Houston-based Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO),
which advanced 30 percent. </p>
<p>Assets Sold </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer John Watson has been selling
refining and retail-fuel assets in Europe and Africa to
concentrate on higher-profit oil production and gas liquefaction
projects. Chevron is scheduled to release full fourth-quarter
results on Jan. 27. </p>
<p>The company''s wells pumped the equivalent of 2.64 million
barrels of crude a day on average during the first two months of
the fourth quarter, a 5.3 percent decline from the full fourth
quarter of 2010. </p>
<p>Prior to today''s announcement, Chevron was expected to
report per-share profit of $3.27 for the fourth quarter, based
on the average estimate of 18 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.
That would be a 24 percent increase from $2.64 a year-earlier.
The company has 21 buy recommendations from analysts, five holds
and one sell rating. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) won a record number of U.S. patents in 2011, its 19th
straight year on top, as some Asian competitors advanced in the
rankings at the expense of Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Intel Corp. (INTC) </p>
<p>IBM, the world''s biggest computer-services provider, gained
6,180 patents last year, researcher IFI Claims Patent Services
said in a statement. Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) was second, its
growth outpacing IBM, and Canon Inc. replaced Microsoft as
third. Panasonic Corp. (6752) moved up to No. 4 and Toshiba Corp. (6502)
advanced to fifth spot. </p>
<p>A patent portfolio spanning from computer memory to online
shopping provides Armonk, New York-based IBM with licensing
revenue and protection against intellectual-property
infringement lawsuits. That means IBM is spending less time in
courts than competitors, Manny Schecter, IBM''s chief patent
counsel, said in an interview before the numbers were released. </p>
<p>Everyone knows that if they attempt to bring their patent
portfolio against us that they will be met with an equal and
opposite force -- and it will be formidable, Schecter said. </p>
<p>IBM also uses its patents to affect trends in technology:
If it wishes to promote certain standards, it may tell other
companies it won''t sue anyone innovating in that area even if
its patents are infringed. So far, the strategy has attracted
clients for consulting on intellectual property management and
requests to testify before Congress, Schecter said. </p>
<p>Asian Surge </p>
<p>Still, IBM''s reign may be threatened in coming years by
Asian rivals, IFI said. Samsung''s 8 percent growth in patents
outpaced IBM''s 5 percent, and in the number of patent
applications Samsung has eclipsed IBM for two years, the
researcher said. Patent applications are an indication of future
patent grants, IFI said. </p>
<p>IBM seems to have a successful strategy that keeps them in
a very prominent position, Mike Baycroft, IFI chief executive
officer, said in an interview. It may not last. As the Asians
file more and more, especially large companies like Samsung,
there is a possibility that they will take over that No. 1
position. </p>
<p>Samsung, based in Suwon, South Korea, gained 4,894 patents
last year, while Canon won 2,821. Microsoft dropped to sixth
place in the rankings, while Intel fell to 16th from eighth.
There were eight Asian and two U.S. companies in the top 10. </p>
<p>In all, the U.S. issued a record 224,505 patents in 2011,
up 2 percent from 2010, Madison, Connecticut-based IFI said. </p>
<p>Perforating Machine </p>
<p>Patents are part of IBM Chief Executive Officer Virginia Ginni Rometty''s strategy as the company seeks to expand in

Rometty, the first woman at the helm in IBM''s 100-year history,
took over from Sam Palmisano Jan. 1 and tries to meet a goal of
adding $20 billion in new revenue between 2010 and 2015.
Analysts on average estimate IBM will report $107.2 billion in
sales for 2011. </p>
<p>The company invests about $6 billion in research and
development each year, and makes about $1 billion in licensing
revenue, said Chris Andrews, a spokesman. IBM has a 250-person
team managing its patents, and it provides training for more
than 8,000 inventors. They record about 20,000 breakthroughs
annually, and only some are submitted for patents. </p>
<p>IBM rose 0.6 percent to $182.32 at the close in New York.
The stock reached a record in 2011 and advanced 25 percent for
the year. </p>
<p>IBM won its first patent for a perforating machine on July
25, 1911. Since then, the company''s inventors have received more
than 70,000 patents, 34,000 of which are active, Andrews said.
The company patented DRAM cells, which became the standard for
computer memory, in 1968. There are also non-computer
inventions, like a laser technique that went on to become the
foundation for LASIK eye surgery. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will pay
$993,841 to settle a suit brought by a group of computer
technicians who said they weren''t paid overtime for their work
as contractors. </p>
<p>The parties asked U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley in
Manhattan in a filing today to approve the settlement. Forty-one
technicians returned claim forms, according to the filing. </p>
<p>The parties reached the settlement agreement after an
arm''s-length mediation held in March 2011, according to the
filing. </p>
<p>In the lawsuit, the technicians said they deserved overtime
pay for working more than 40 hours a week. Work weeks topped 70
hours, and more than 100 employees in New York and New Jersey
were underpaid as a result, they said in the complaint filed in
May 2010. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is making plans for
a companywide restructuring of its marketing operations, a move
that may include hundreds of job cuts, according to people
familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>The plans haven''t been settled and could change, according
to the people, who asked not to be named because the review
isn''t public. Job cuts are unlikely to involve thousands of
employees, the people said. Initial steps could be announced
within the next 30 days, according to one person. </p>
<p>The changes would eliminate overlap in job responsibilities
and are designed to help the company better respond to threats
from Apple Inc. (AAPL), Google (GOOG) Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., which are
increasingly targeting Microsoft''s corporate-computing
customers. Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer
doesn''t think the company is getting enough return on the
billions it spends annually on marketing, the people said. </p>
<p>The review is being lead by Chris Capossela, who took over
as the company''s chief marketing officer last year, according to
the people. Capossela is working with senior marketing
executives for each of Microsoft''s business groups, such as
Yusuf Mehdi from the Xbox unit and Tami Reller from Windows, one
of the people said. </p>
<p>Moving People Around </p>
<p>Changes may include shifting some of the more technical
marketing workers to engineering groups, cutting employees who
don''t have needed skills or whose work is duplicated by other
workers, and revamping how marketing groups are organized and
where they fit into the rest of the company, the people said. </p>
<p>Peter Wootton, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Microsoft spent $13.9 billion on sales and marketing in
fiscal 2011, which ended on June 30, up 5.5 percent from the
previous year. Microsoft said then that it had 25,000 workers
devoted to those tasks, without breaking out how many are
focused on marketing. The company had about 90,000 full-time
employees in total. </p>
<p>Consumer-focused technology companies like Apple are making
inroads in the business world, forcing the information-
technology industry to regroup. Apple will sell $10 billion
worth of iPads and $9 billion of Mac computers to corporate
customers this year, a 58 percent jump, Forrester Research Inc. (FORR)
said in a report last week. </p>
<p>Google announced a deal earlier today to supply e-mail and
business services to the Spanish bank Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
Argentaria SA, marking the biggest corporate contract for the
Internet-search company. </p>
<p>Microsoft also is facing rising costs because of a shift to
cloud software, which is stored in the company''s data centers
and delivered over the Internet. Its $8.5 billion purchase of
Skype Technologies SA and Xbox gaming products are increasing
expenses as well. </p>
<p>Microsoft announced its first-ever companywide firings in
January 2009, a move that included more than 5,000 jobs by the
time it concluded. </p>

<p>Bill Templer and Richard Evans,
managing directors at Morgan Stanley''s equities unit in London
were among bankers who left the firm this week, a person with
knowledge of the matter said, as the sovereign debt crisis
erodes trading profit in the industry. </p>
<p>Templer was the co-head of listed derivatives and Evans
worked for Delta One strategy, the person said, declining to be
identified as the details aren''t public. The Delta One desk
handles trades for clients, typically helping them to speculate
on, or hedge the performance of, a basket of securities. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley said last month it planned to eliminate
1,600 jobs because of an industrywide drop in revenue from
investment banking and trading. The cuts amount to about 2.6
percent of the New York-based bank''s employees at the end of
September. The job losses will take place in the first quarter
at all levels, Morgan Stanley (MS) said. </p>
<p>A spokesman for the bank in London declined to comment on
the departures today. Templer and Evans didn''t pick up calls to
their office. The Financial Times reported the story earlier
today. </p>
<p>Financial-services firms have scaled back and shut
divisions that trade equities in Europe as the region''s debt
crisis trimmed profitability last year. UniCredit SpA, Italy''s
largest bank, shuttered its western European equities unit in
November, joining at least five other firms including, Nomura
Holdings Inc., that eliminated equities staff in Europe last
year. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the U.S.
bank that gets more than 60 percent of its revenue from trading,
named James R. Paradise and Eiji Ueda co-heads of the firm''s
securities division in Asia. </p>
<p>Paradise, who is based in London, and Ueda, who works in
Tokyo, will move to Hong Kong to assume their new
responsibilities, according to an internal memo obtained by
Bloomberg News. They will report to Katsunori Sago, deputy
president of Goldman Sachs Japan, and to David C. Ryan,
president of Goldman Sachs Asia Pacific Ex-Japan. </p>
<p>Paradise and Ueda are assuming some of the responsibilities
previously held by Yusuf Alireza, who left Goldman Sachs in
November after 19 years at the company. Alireza, who oversaw the
securities division in Asia, was promoted a year ago to be co-
president of the Asia-Pacific region outside Japan with Ryan. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s securities division, which handles sales
and trading of equities, fixed-income, currencies and
commodities, has been managed globally since 2008 by David B. Heller, Edward K. Eisler, Pablo J. Salame, and Harvey M. Schwartz. The company generated $14.2 billion in revenue from
its institutional client sales and trading business in the first
nine months of 2011, down 22 percent from a year earlier. </p>
<p>Paradise, 47, has been co-head of Goldman Sachs''s global
securities services, futures and execution business since 2008,
according to the memo. A British citizen, he joined the firm in
1989, was promoted to managing director in 2000 and became a
partner in 2004. In his new role he will be a member of the Asia
Pacific Management Committee as well as co-chair, with Ueda, of
the Securities Division Asia Pacific Operating Committee,
according to the memo. </p>
<p>Ueda''s Committee Memberships </p>
<p>Ueda, a Japanese citizen who joined Goldman Sachs in 1991
and has been a partner since 2002, has been co-head of fixed-
income, currencies and commodities in Japan since 2009,
according to the memo. He is co-chair of the Asia Pacific Risk
Committee and is a member of the Asia Pacific Management
Committee, Securities Division Asia Pacific Operating Committee,
Korea Operating Committee and Firmwide Risk Committee. </p>
<p>Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman in New York,
confirmed the contents of the memo, which was signed by Heller,
Eisler, Salame and Schwartz. Reuters reported Paradise and
Ueda''s new assignments earlier today. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world''s biggest
software company, sued Shanghai Gome Electrical Appliances Co.
in China, alleging the retailer had offered computers with
pirated versions of its Windows and Office programs. </p>
<p>The lawsuit against Gome was filed at the Shanghai Huangpu
District People''s Court, the Redmond, Washington-based company
said in an e-mailed statement dated Jan. 6. Separately,
Microsoft sued Clevo Co. (2362)''s Buynow retail unit at a court in
Beijing, according to the statement. </p>
<p>Microsoft is boosting efforts to counter unauthorized use
of its software in China, which surpassed the U.S. last year as
the world''s biggest market for personal computers. About 78
percent of software in China was pirated in 2010, according to
estimates by the Business Software Alliance. </p>
<p>Two computer vendors with stores in a Buynow mall in
Beijing were offering products with pirated Microsoft software,

<p>Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong
may rise about 17 percent by the end of the year as China''s
government relaxes monetary policies, according to Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) </p>
<p>The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) of so-called H shares
may reach 12,200 by Dec. 31, compared with yesterday''s close of
10,413.61, Helen Zhu, a Goldman Sachs strategist, said in a
Bloomberg Television interview today. The gauge advanced 0.8
percent to 10,500.34 as of 3:17 p.m. local time. Hong Kong''s
benchmark Hang Seng Index (HSI) may reach 22,000, Zhu said. The gauge
settled yesterday at 19,004.28. </p>
<p>The H-share index has risen 5.6 percent this year, while
the Shanghai Composite Index advanced 3.5 percent after a
weekend central bank report showed new bank lending and money
supply exceeded economist estimates in December. </p>
<p>The data prompted investors to think that the government
may have moved very preemptively, Zhu said. China may reduce
the amount banks have to keep in reserve in the first half of
the year and any cut in interest rates would likely happen in
the second half, she said. </p>
<p>The People''s Bank of China cut banks'' reserve-requirement
ratios from a record high for the first time in three years on
Nov. 30. Expectations for more monetary easing escalated after
inflation cooled to the slowest pace in 14 months in November
and industrial output growth weakened. Import growth fell to a
two-year low in December, data yesterday showed. </p>
<p>CLSA Cautious </p>
<p>The Shanghai and H-share indexes tumbled 22 percent last
year after the PBOC raised interest rates and reserve
requirement ratios to combat rising prices. Data due tomorrow
may show inflation slowed to 4 percent in December, the lowest
level since September 2010, according to the median estimate in
a Bloomberg economist survey. </p>
<p>CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets has turned cautious on China''s
stocks because of downside risk to the economy from slumping
property prices. The CSI 300 Index may rise to 2,600 in the
first half of this year while earnings growth may slow to 5
percent compared with the consensus estimate of 19 percent,
Manop Sangiambut, CLSA''s head of China A-share research, said in
a report dated yesterday. </p>
<p>The central bank may undertake reactive policy
loosening rather than proactive, he said. The CSI 300 index (SHSZ300),
the 300 most valuable companies trading in the Shanghai and
Shenzhen exchanges, retreated 0.5 percent today to 2,435.61. </p>
<p>New bank lending totaled 640.5 billion yuan ($101 billion)
in December, according to a statement posted on the PBOC''s
website on Jan. 8. The amount exceeded the 575 billion yuan
median estimate of 18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. M2, a
measure of money supply, rose 13.6 percent, compared with the
12.9 percent median of 18 estimates. </p>

<p>A tax-free bond program that
provided below-market financing to build Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS)''s headquarters is expiring while New York developers say
the city''s commercial real estate market still needs support. </p>
<p>Congress created the Liberty Bond program in March 2002
with $8 billion in tax-exempt funds to rebuild lower Manhattan
after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The allocation ran out
last month, and the tax exemption ended on Dec. 31 along with
dozens of other breaks for manufacturers, energy companies and
transit commuters. </p>
<p>Critics that include affordable housing advocates say the
bonds were little more than a subsidy for fancy Manhattan
apartments and office towers for Goldman Sachs and Bank of
America Corp. Developers counter that, more than a decade after
the attacks, low-cost financing remains necessary to help lower
Manhattan''s commercial market recover. </p>
<p>The Liberty Bonds made available to the World Trade
Center site are only enough to support rebuilding a little less
than 60 percent of the office space lost on 9/11, Larry Silverstein, the World Trade Center''s developer, said in an e-
mail. In an ideal world, more such resources would be made
available to help jump-start construction of the remaining 40
percent of the office space that was destroyed by terrorists. </p>

<p>General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP)
completed its spinoff of 30 retail properties into a publicly
traded company, allowing the second-largest U.S. mall owner to
focus on better-performing centers. </p>
<p>The portfolio was spun off to shareholders as Rouse
Properties Inc. (RSE-W), a real estate investment trust based in New
York, Rouse said today in a statement. The name of the new REIT
comes from General Growth''s $11.3 billion purchase of
commercial-property developer Rouse Co. in 2004. </p>
<p>General Growth, based in Chicago, divested itself of the
malls to concentrate on properties with higher rents and tenant
sales and to reduce debt. Rouse''s malls are either the main
shopping center in smaller U.S. cities or are second-tier
properties in major markets. </p>
<p>It''s not a troubled portfolio, Craig Guttenplan, an
analyst at CreditSights Inc. in London, said in a telephone
interview before the spinoff was completed. It''s just
properties with less growth potential. </p>
<p>Rouse''s 30 malls are 88 percent occupied and generate sales
of about $280 per square foot, Nathan Isbee, an analyst at
Stifel Nicolaus  Co., wrote in a Nov. 11 report. General Growth
had tenant sales of $471 a square foot on a trailing 12-month
basis as of Sept. 30, and a 92.7 percent occupancy rate for its
regional malls, the company said on Nov. 9. </p>
<p>Rouse plans to spend $200 million on property redevelopment
by the end of 2015 to boost net operating income, the company
said in a regulatory filing last month. </p>
<p>Rouse was expected to have about $1.16 billion of debt with
a weighted average interest rate of about 5.6 percent at the
time of the spinoff, General Growth said on Dec. 20. </p>
<p>Andrew Silberfein took over as chief executive officer of
Rouse on Jan. 2, according to a regulatory filing. Silberfein
previously was executive vice president of retail and finance at
Forest City Ratner Cos., where he worked since 1995. </p>
<p>Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG), based in Indianapolis, is the
only U.S. mall owner larger than General Growth. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon shuffled part of his management team and
recombined oversight of retail units that was split last year at
the biggest U.S. bank. </p>
<p>Dimon promoted Doug Petno to run commercial banking and
moved Chief Risk Officer Barry Zubrow to head regulatory, public
relations and lobbying strategy, Dimon wrote today in an
internal memo obtained by Bloomberg News. Joe Evangelisti, a
spokesman for the New York-based bank, confirmed the memo''s
contents. </p>
<p>John Hogan, who was managing risk at JPMorgan''s investment
bank, will succeed Zubrow in overseeing risk companywide,
according to the memo. Hogan also joined the firm''s 14-member
operating committee, reporting directly to Dimon, 55. </p>
<p>Jay Mandelbaum, who ran strategy and business development,
is leaving the firm to focus on entrepreneurial and other
interests, Dimon wrote. Jay has been an excellent partner of
mine since 1992, and I will miss him tremendously. </p>
<p>Todd Maclin, head of retail banking, and Gordon Smith, who
runs the credit-card division, now are co-CEOs of consumer
finance, according to the memo. In June, Dimon separated
management of the retail bank into three divisions -- mortgage,
retail banking and credit cards -- when the previous CEO of all
three units, Charlie Scharf, was reassigned to the private-
equity unit as a partner. </p>
<p>It has become clear to our leadership that we should run
the Chase consumer business as one business and one brand, one
that focuses first and foremost on serving our customers in the
way they want and with the products they need, Dimon wrote. </p>
<p>Frank Bisignano, who was appointed in February to oversee
the company''s mortgage division, will continue in that role,
according to the memo. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), likely to
keep the title of most profitable U.S. bank when it reports
earnings tomorrow, has a West Coast rival closing in: Wells
Fargo  Co. (WFC) </p>
<p>JPMorgan is projected to report a record $18.5 billion in
2011 earnings when adjusted for one-time items, a 6 percent
increase for the New York-based company, according to a survey
of analysts by Bloomberg. Profit at San Francisco-based Wells
Fargo is estimated to have jumped more than four times as much,
to an all-time high of $15.3 billion. </p>
<p>By focusing on the U.S. and eschewing traditional Wall
Street businesses such as structured products, Wells Fargo
surpassed earnings at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Citigroup
Inc. for six consecutive quarters. Wells Fargo, whose $1.3
trillion in assets make it the fourth-largest U.S. bank, also
has higher valuations than its bigger peers. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo never really embraced investment banking as
heavily as the Wall Street crowd has, said Paul Miller, a
former examiner for the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and
analyst at FBR Capital Markets in Arlington, Virginia. I think
one of the reasons Wells is where they are right now is because
they did not get into that business in a bigger way, he said. </p>
<p>The strains on investment banking will be apparent in
JPMorgan''s fourth-quarter profit, as well as weak trading
results predicted for its smaller competitors when they report
earnings next week, Miller said. </p>
<p>Earnings Ratio </p>
<p>Wells Fargo is being rewarded for its restraint with a
market value of $156.2 billion, compared with $139.3 billion at
JPMorgan and $91.4 billion at No. 3 Citigroup. (C) Only Goldman
Sachs trades at a higher price-to-earnings ratio than Wells
Fargo among the biggest U.S. lenders, at 10.76 versus 10.25. The
higher the ratio, the faster investors think the company''s
profit will grow. </p>
<p>Traditional banking, predominantly making loans and
taking deposits and serving both corporate and individual
consumers, is being viewed more favorably right now by the
investor community, said Ed Najarian, who runs bank research
at International Strategy and Investment Group in New York.
It''s considered safer and to have a steadier and more
consistent earnings outlook. </p>
<p>Share Performance </p>
<p>Wells Fargo has dropped 7.5 percent in New York trading in
the past 12 months, compared with declines of 18 percent for
JPMorgan and 54 percent for Bank of America Corp. (BAC) Wells Fargo
rose to $30 at 7:37 a.m. in New York from $29.62 yesterday,
while JPMorgan climbed to $37.13 from $36.66. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo, which reports earnings on Jan. 17, owes its
relative good fortune partly to Europe''s sovereign debt crisis,
which slammed investment-banking results in the second half of
last year at JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and other firms with large
trading desks and international divisions. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, will probably
report a 23 percent slump in fourth-quarter adjusted profit from
the same period in 2010 to $3.74 billion, or 90 cents a share,
according to the survey. Analysts lowered their estimates after
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 55, said at a Dec. 7
investor conference that trading would be essentially flat
from the third quarter. </p>
<p>Banking Units </p>
<p>Revenue at the company''s investment-banking unit slid this
year from $8.2 billion in the first quarter to about $4.5
billion in the third after backing out a $1.9 billion one-time
accounting gain as concern mounted that Greece would default and
U.S. lawmakers would fail to raise the debt ceiling. JPMorgan
told investors in October that the division would face similar
market conditions for the rest of the year. </p>
<p>Trading results got a lift in the third quarter as the
price of bank debt fell, resulting in a so-called debt-valuation
adjustment that boosted profits for JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and
Citigroup. The accounting adjustment probably hurt banks in the
fourth quarter as price of their debt rose, resulting in the
opposite effect on earnings. </p>
<p>Trading and investment-banking revenue has been weak and
volatile, especially over the last two quarters, but really the
last two years, Najarian said. Investment-banking results will
be worse for the fourth quarter than in the third quarter, he
said. </p>
<p>Revenue Declines </p>
<p>Overall revenue at JPMorgan is expected to drop 13 percent
for the quarter and 4 percent for the year, to $98.9 billion.
Fixed-income trading revenue at U.S. banks may fall 12 percent
from the third quarter, minus accounting adjustments, while
equities revenue drop 10 percent and investment-bank revenue
remains unchanged, David Trone, an analyst at JMP Securities,
wrote in a Dec. 16 report. </p>
<p>Markets showed little improvement in the fourth quarter, as
trading remained subdued, corporate and institutional clients
stayed out of the markets and the holidays slowed deal and
trading traffic. </p>
<p>Lenders will continue to face pressure from persistently
low interest rates, which have compressed profit margins on
lending. They''ll also have to contend with new restrictions on
fees. </p>
<p>The so-called Durbin amendment, which limits what lenders
can charge merchants on debit transactions, took effect on Oct.
1, affecting almost all U.S. banks and costing the top 25 about
$1.5 billion, according to Jason Goldberg, a senior bank analyst
at Barclays Capital in New York. </p>
<p>Avoiding Trash'' </p>
<p>Wells Fargo avoided a lot of the trash that others kind
of fell into leading into the 2008 financial crisis, Goldberg
said in an interview. The company, led by CEO John Stumpf, 58,
will see its fee revenue fall by about $350 million and JPMorgan
will lose roughly $300 million, Goldberg estimated. </p>
<p>The big issue for the banks is, is this a cyclical or a
secular problem? And the answer is, it''s both, said Richard Bove, an analyst at Rochdale Securities LLC in Lutz, Florida.
Bove said U.S. lenders are starting to perform more like
utilities with smaller growth rates and less leverage. Goldman
Sachs may never generate 10 percent or 12 percent growth rates
again, he said. </p>
<p>It''s not going to happen because the leverage in the
balance sheet is gone, the off-balance-sheet conduits are
illegal, the variable-interest entities are limited, the
structured-investment vehicles are gone, Bove said, referring
to the types of securities that helped trigger the U.S. economic
crisis. The leverage isn''t there and the market isn''t there. </p>
<p>Optimistic Outlook </p>
<p>Large super-regional banks such as Wells Fargo and
Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial Services Group Inc. will probably
fare better as the basic business of taking deposits and making
loans gives reason for optimism, Goldberg said. Lending at U.S.
banks was up 2.1 percent from the third to the fourth quarter
while deposits rose 5.6 percent, according to Federal Reserve
data. Goldberg said the growth offset slimmer profit margins in
the fourth quarter. </p>
<p>In this quarter you''re going to see dramatically
different results in each segment, with the traditional banks
having the best performance and the capital markets having the
worst, Bove said. </p>
<p>Mike Mayo, an analyst with independent research firm CLSA
in New York, said U.S. banks are in the middle of the industry''s
worst two years of revenue growth since the Great Depression.
Earnings for the fourth quarter will be weak and won''t see much
improvement this year, he said. </p>
<p>Friday the 13th </p>
<p>Friday the 13th will live up to its name when it comes to
bank earnings, Mayo said in an interview yesterday at
Bloomberg''s headquarters in New York promoting his new book,
Exile on Wall Street. When banks start reporting results
with JPMorgan tomorrow, you''re going to see all sorts of
revenue and margin pressure and the results will be
underwhelming. </p>
<p>Bank of America, second by assets to JPMorgan, will
probably post $5.84 billion in adjusted earnings for the year, a
63 percent plunge from 2010, according to the Bloomberg survey. </p>
<p>Citigroup''s 2011 profit was estimated at $11.8 billion, or
13 percent higher than the previous year, and Goldman Sachs is
projected to report a 57 percent decline to $3.35 billion.
Morgan Stanley (MS), the sixth-largest U.S. bank, may post $2.23
billion of adjusted earnings, down 28 percent. All three
companies are based in New York. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. fell the most
in almost a month in New York trading after the bank reported a
23 percent drop in profit on lower investment-banking fees and
revenue (JPM) from trading stocks and bonds. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, dropped 2.5
percent to $35.92 at 4:15 p.m., the steepest decline since Dec.
19. The company said fourth-quarter net income slid to $3.73
billion, or 90 cents a share, from $4.83 billion, or $1.12, in
the same period a year earlier. </p>
<p>Revenue in every investment-banking business fell from a
year earlier, including an 18 percent drop in trading. The
division''s total revenue declined 30 percent to $4.36 billion as
corporate clients stayed on the sidelines on concern Europe''s
debt crisis would lead to an economic slowdown. Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon said the investment-banking business is
naturally volatile and would eventually bounce back. </p>
<p>I don''t think that these numbers are permanent, Dimon,
55, said on a conference call with journalists after earnings
were released. When things come back these numbers will boom
again and we''ll be geniuses, and it won''t be because we did
anything, it will be because we stayed in the game. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s drop was the third-biggest on the KBW Bank Index (BKX)
of 24 companies, after 2.7 percent declines at both Citigroup
Inc. (C) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) </p>
<p>Job Cuts </p>
<p>Financial institutions are eliminating jobs to compensate
for falling trading revenue, disclosing plans to reduce staff by
more than 200,000 worldwide, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Britain''s biggest
government-owned bank, said this week it would cut about 4,800. </p>
<p>For the year, JPMorgan''s net income was a record $19
billion, 9 percent higher than in 2010. Revenue for 2011
declined 5 percent to $97.2 billion, and fourth-quarter revenue
fell 18 percent, to $21.5 billion, the lowest in three years and
below the $22.6 billion estimated by analysts in the Bloomberg
survey. </p>
<p>We believe these returns were reasonable given the
environment, although the return for the fourth quarter was
modestly disappointing, Dimon said in the statement. </p>
<p>Fixed-income and equity-markets revenue dropped to $3.27
billion from $4 billion a year earlier and $4.75 billion in the
third quarter, the company said. </p>
<p>Retail banking earned $533 million, down 54 percent from
the third quarter and up 16 percent from a year earlier. The
division benefited from a reduction in loss provisions to $779
million from $2.42 billion in the prior year. </p>
<p>Credit Cards </p>
<p>Fewer consumers fell behind on credit-card payments in the
fourth quarter compared with the same period in 2010. Loans at
least 30 days overdue, a signal of future write-offs, fell to
1.13 percent from 1.22 percent. Write-offs dropped to 4.29
percent from 7.85 percent the prior year and 4.7 percent in the
previous quarter. </p>
<p>The so-called Durbin amendment, which limits what lenders
can charge merchants on debit transactions, took effect on Oct.
1, affecting almost all U.S. banks and costing the top 25 about
$1.5 billion, Jason Goldberg, a senior bank analyst at Barclays
Capital in New York, said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan said today the new rules will reduce its net
income by about $600 million a year, and Dimon said on the call
that the Durbin amendment was a gross miscarriage of
justice. Chief Financial Officer Douglas Braunstein said the
Durbin amendment reduced revenue $350 million in the fourth
quarter. </p>
<p>Mortgage Buybacks </p>
<p>Losses from buying back mortgages JPMorgan previously sold
may amount to about $350 million per quarter this year, the bank
forecast today. Quarterly repurchase losses averaged $337
million last year. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s net income continued to benefit from releasing
back into earnings reserves previously set aside for bad
mortgages, credit cards and other loans, although it was smaller
than in previous periods. The bank released $723 million in
reserves in the fourth quarter, compared with $2.1 billion a
year earlier. The bank added $4.66 billion in net income through
reserve releases for the year, compared with $7 billion in 2010. </p>
<p>The company continued to build its litigation reserves,
setting aside $528 million more for mortgage-related lawsuits. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, which has benefited from record low costs of
funding mortgages and other assets, faces a squeeze on its net
interest margin -- the difference between what it pays to borrow
money and what it gets for loans and on securities. </p>
<p>The bank''s margin narrowed to 2.7 percent from 2.88 percent
a year earlier. </p>
<p>Lower Taxes </p>
<p>JPMorgan was able to boost profit last quarter by paying
less in taxes. The company''s effective tax rate was 21 percent
in the fourth quarter, compared with 31 percent a year earlier
and 27 percent in the third quarter. </p>
<p>The lower tax rate contributed about 10 cents to JPMorgan''s
per-share earnings, helping it to meet or beat some analysts''
estimates, Keith Horowitz of Citigroup Investment Research, said
in a note to clients today. </p>
<p>Goldberg at Barclays Capital said the fourth quarter was
probably the worst earnings period for the industry during 2011. </p>
<p>A lot of it is driven by the challenging capital markets
environment, he said in a Jan. 9 interview. Trading revenues
started out the year off strong, and then the second half of the
year was quite challenged. That business bounces around. </p>
<p>U.S. banks are in the middle of the industry''s worst two
years of revenue growth since the Great Depression, according to
Mike Mayo, an analyst with independent research firm CLSA in New
York. Earnings across the industry were weak in the fourth
quarter and won''t have much improvement this year, he said. </p>
<p>Bank Stocks </p>
<p>Slowing economic growth, mounting mortgage liabilities and
heightened concern that Europe''s debt crisis will spread have
weighed on bank stocks all year. Just two of the 24 companies in
the KBW Bank Index posted a gain in 2011, and the worst
performer, Bank of America, was down 58 percent. </p>
<p>Large super-regional banks such as Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) and
Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial Services Group Inc. will probably
fare better as the basic business of taking deposits and making
loans gives reason for optimism, Goldberg said. </p>
<p>Bank of America, second by assets to JPMorgan, will
probably post $5.82 billion in adjusted earnings for the year
when the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company reports next
week, according to the Bloomberg survey. </p>
<p>Citigroup''s 2011 profit was estimated at $11.6 billion, or
12 percent higher than the previous year, and Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) is projected to report a 62 percent decline to $2.95
billion, the Bloomberg survey shows. Morgan Stanley, the sixth-
largest U.S. bank, may post $2.22 billion of adjusted earnings,
down 29 percent. All three companies are based in New York. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., the largest
U.S. bank by assets, sold $3 billion of bonds in its biggest
debt sale in almost a year as relative yields on bank debt fall
to an eight-week low. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, which said today fourth-quarter profit fell 23
percent amid declines in trading revenue and investment-banking
fees, sold 4.5 percent, 10-year notes, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. (JPM) The New York-based bank''s securities
yield 270 basis points, or 2.7 percentage points, above similar-
maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, which sold almost $24 billion of bonds last year,
got the lowest interest rate since 2005 on a sale of 30-year
bonds by a bank in December, Bloomberg data show. The extra
yield investors demand to own U.S. dollar-denominated bank debt
instead of Treasuries fell to 364 basis points yesterday, the
lowest since Nov. 18, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data. That compares with average spreads of 260 basis
points on JPMorgan''s debt. </p>
<p>This is a hard name not to like from a credit
perspective, especially considering similarly rated names such
as Wells Fargo trade almost 100 basis points within JPMorgan
debt, Morningstar Inc. analyst James Leonard wrote in a note
today. Assuming investors can still buy the JPM name and are
not filled up because of diversification constraints, this new
deal is very attractive, he wrote, using the company''s ticker
symbol. </p>
<p>Previous Sale </p>
<p>The offering was the bank''s biggest sale since February
2011, when it issued $3 billion of five-year notes, Bloomberg
data show. It''s JPMorgan''s biggest issue of 10-year notes in the
U.S. since April 2009, the data show. </p>
<p>JPMorgan last sold 10-year notes in October, issuing $1.75
billion of 4.35 percent securities in an add-on to a $1.25
billion offering of the debt in August, Bloomberg data show. The
securities priced at a 225 basis-point spread, Bloomberg data
show. </p>
<p>Rival Wells Fargo  Co., based in San Francisco, last sold
10-year notes in March, issuing $2.5 billion of 4.6 percent, 10-
year senior unsecured notes at a 130 basis-point spread,
Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>JPMorgan said today that net income dropped to $3.73
billion, or 90 cents a share, from $4.83 billion, or $1.12, in
the similar period a year earlier, according to a statement.
Earnings matched the average estimate of 28 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Investment-Banking Results </p>
<p>Revenue in every investment-banking business fell from a
year earlier, including an 18 percent drop in trading. The
division''s total revenue fell 30 percent to $4.36 billion as
corporate clients stayed on the sidelines on concern Europe''s
debt crisis would lead to an economic slowdown. </p>
<p>The drop was larger than Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon forecast in December, when he said investment-banking
revenue would be essentially flat from the third quarter''s
$6.37 billion. </p>
<p>Despite the drop in profit, the company''s Tier 1 common
ratio using Basel III calculations is estimated at 7.9 percent
from 7 percent last year, Morningstar''s Leonard wrote in the
note today. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. approached
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with a bid for a block of
the mortgage bonds assumed from American International Group
Inc. (AIG), prompting the central bank to weigh an auction of the
debt, three people familiar with the matter said. </p>
<p>The central bank may sell securities held by its Maiden
Lane II vehicle with a face value of about $7 billion, said the
people, who declined to be identified because the deliberations
are private. New York-based Goldman Sachs may have sought the
bonds for itself or clients, they said. Four or five dealers may
be asked to assemble bids this month, they said. </p>
<p>Goldman''s never been bashful, I call them opportunistic
as a compliment, Steven Delaney, an analyst at San Francisco-
based JMP Securities LLC who covers real estate investment
trusts that invest in mortgages, said today on Bloomberg
Television. But Goldman''s not the only major investor that
sees value in U.S. home-loan bonds with government backing
after prices slumped, he said. </p>
<p>Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs (GS), declined to
comment, as did the New York Fed''s Jack Gutt and Mark Herr of
New York-based AIG. The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday
the potential sale and Goldman Sachs''s bid. </p>
<p>The New York Fed halted in June a plan to sell the Maiden
Lane II assets through a series of auctions after its sales of
about $10 billion roiled markets, dragging down everything from
high-yield corporate bonds to commercial-mortgage securities as
Wall Street dealers sought to reduce risk after building their
inventories. AIG turned over the holdings to the New York Fed in
2008 as part of its rescue. </p>
<p>Market Conditions'' </p>
<p>The central bank said last year it might resume selling the
bonds individually and in segments over time as market
conditions warrant through a competitive sales process.
Securities with a face value of $21 billion remained when the
auctions were halted. The Fed valued the Maiden Lane II (FARWML2) holdings
at about $9.1 billion as of this week. </p>
<p>Values of so-called non-agency mortgage securities fell
further and trading shriveled as Europe''s debt crisis
intensified after the end of the auctions. Paul Norris, a senior
money manager at Burlington, Vermont-based Dwight Asset
Management Co., said that because the prospect of additional Fed
sales has been weighing on the market, a successful auction
could be positive. </p>
<p>In a disaster scenario, a Fed sale could disrupt the
market again by creating too much supply, said Norris, whose
firm manages and advises on more than $50 billion of assets. </p>
<p>The portfolio includes securities backed by the types of
home loans with some of the highest default rates, such as so-
called subprime, Alt-A and option adjustable-rate mortgage debt.
The New York Fed began unloading the bonds piecemeal in April
after rejecting a $15.7 billion bid from AIG for the entire pool
the previous month. </p>
<p>Adjustable-Rate Mortgages </p>
<p>A rout in the market for the bonds has eased, with typical
prices of top-ranked securities tied to Alt-A ARMs unchanged at
48 cents on the dollar in the month ended Jan. 4, according to
Barclays Capital data. The bonds had plunged from last year''s
high of 68 cents in February. Alt-A loans fall between prime and
subprime in terms of expected defaults. </p>
<p>A Fed auction may help the $1.1 trillion market for non-
agency securities by offering new information on current values,
JMP''s Delaney said. Trading has been limited in recent months,
he said. </p>
<p>If the portfolio is sold to an individual investor or group
assembled by dealers in an all-or-nothing process, that may
obscure bids on specific securities and a lack of price
discovery is inherently not good, said Adam Murphy, president
of Empirasign Strategies LLC, a New York-based provider of data
on securitization-market trading. </p>

<p>The European Central Bank''s move to
provide three-year loans to the region''s banks and accept a
wider variety of collateral has eliminated the risk a bank runs
short of funds for at least the next year, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said. </p>
<p>It eliminates bank liquidity or funding problems for at
least the next year, that''s a pretty powerful statement, Dimon
said today after his company reported a drop in fourth-quarter
net income. That was the biggest single risk of an
uncontrollable surprise right there, so if that''s taken off the
table, that''s a good thing. </p>
<p>ECB President Mario Draghi last month unveiled plans to
offer banks 36-month, 1 percent loans through two so-called
longer-term refinancing operations, known as LTROs. The plan
replaced a 12-month lending facility established by the ECB in
October and also allowed banks to use a wider variety of assets
as collateral for the loans. </p>
<p>Europe is trying mightily to solve its problems. I still
think the likely outcome is they will muddle through, Dimon
said. The longer you wait, the higher you run the risk of
something disorderly that you can''t really control. I think the
ECB took off the worst outcome, i.e. a bank failure. </p>
<p>The 46-member Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial Services
Index climbed 2.5 percent in December after slumping 8.3 percent
in November. So far this year, the index is up 0.3 percent. </p>
<p>Banks in Europe are still shedding so-called risk-weighted
assets, or RWAs, because regulators are requiring them to
increase their ratios of equity capital to RWAs, Dimon said. </p>
<p>They''re still reducing RWA by not rolling things over,
you can see them selling aircraft loans, trade finance, they''re
not participating as much in revolvers, there are certain
conduits they''re not doing anymore, Dimon said. But that''s
now just to create capital, not because they have a funding
problem. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s investment
bank cut employee compensation 9 percent to $8.88 billion in
2011 as the division generated 0.2 percent more revenue last
year. </p>
<p>The expense, which includes salaries, bonuses and benefits,
was enough to give each of the unit''s 25,999 employees an
average of $341,552, according to figures posted today on the
New York-based company''s website. The division set aside $9.73
billion in 2010 to pay traders, dealmakers and other personnel,
or $369,651 for each of the 26,314 people on staff (JPM) at the end of
that year. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s investment bank had 616 fewer people at the end
of the fourth quarter than at the end of the previous three-
month period and 315 fewer than a year earlier, according to the
disclosure. Staff companywide expanded 8 percent to 260,157 from
2010. </p>
<p>Jes Staley, chief executive officer of JPMorgan''s
investment bank, set aside 34 percent of the division''s revenue
for pay last year, down from 37 percent in 2010. </p>
<p>Investment-bank employees were bracing for a smaller-than-
usual bonus pool even as annual net income for the unit climbed
2 percent to $6.79 billion from a year earlier. A portion of the
division''s quarterly profits came from one-time accounting
adjustments, skewing results. </p>
<p>Quarterly revenue at the investment-banking unit slid last
year from $8.23 billion in the first quarter to $4.36 billion in
the fourth quarter as concerns mounted that the debt crisis in
Greece would spread to other European nations. </p>
<p>The average compensation figures, which don''t represent
individual workers'' actual pay, are derived by dividing the
overall compensation pool by the number of employees. </p>

yesterday in Copenhagen. There are now some divisions between
France, Germany and Britain on things that are not so
difficult. </p>
<p>While governments from all but two of the 27 EU nations
have agreed on the basic structure of the patent system, discord
remains on all points concerning the creation of a patent
court, Pierre Delsaux, deputy director general in EU Internal
Markets Commissioner Michel Barnier''s department, said on Dec.
7. Last March, 25 EU nations agreed to move ahead with a common
patent system; Italy and Spain opted out of the plans because
they objected to the language proposals. </p>
<p>We can finalize this community patent that we have been
discussing for 30 years, Barroso said yesterday. So it''s
about time to come to a solution. </p>

<p>Corbis'' GreenLight Unit Will Represent Martin Luther King Jr. </p>
<p>Corbis Corp.''s GreenLight unit has been selected to manage
advertising, promotion and merchandise related to the late
Martin Luther King Jr. Seattle-based Corbis is owned by
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) founder Bill Gates. </p>
<p>The agreement marks the first time the estate of the late
civil rights leader has worked with an external agency,
according to a GreenLight statement. </p>
<p>In the years since King''s death in 1968, members of his
family have clashed over intellectual property rights. </p>
<p>In October 2008, his daughter Bernice King refused to hand
over the love letters her mother received from her father. The
estate had signed a $1.4 million contract with Pearson Plc''s
Penguin Group for a biography of King''s widow, the late Coretta Scott King. </p>
<p>Bernice and her brother Martin Luther King III said they
hadn''t been included in negotiations with Steven Speilberg''s
DreamWorks SKG over the use of their father''s story in a
proposed film. That deal was put together by their brother,
Dexter King, on behalf of the estate. </p>
<p>Destiny, Envirosight Settle Clipstream'' Trademark Dispute </p>
<p>Destiny Media Technologies Inc. (DSNY) settled a trademark
infringement suit related to its clipstream trademark. </p>
<p>Destiny, based in Vancouver, British Columbia, sued a New
Jersey maker of digital video software and hardware for
trademark infringement in federal court in Newark, New Jersey,
in January 2011. </p>
<p>The company claimed that Randolph, New Jersey-based
Envirosight was trying to trade on goodwill associated with the
mark by using it in connection with Envirosight products.
Destiny sued after a cease-and-desist letter had no effect,
according to court papers. </p>
<p>The settlement agreement mandated that Envirosight quit
using clipstream with any of its products and services. </p>
<p>Destiny, which offers content companies a secure
distribution system for their music, had sought money damages
and attorney fees. </p>
<p>According to court documents, Envirosight was ordered to
pay Destiny $3,000, and to remove a press release to which
Destiny had objected. Destiny was given permission to issue a
statement about the dispute''s settlement, containing no
reference to the monetary component of dispute or disparagement
of Envirosight. </p>
<p>The case is Destiny Software Productions Inc. v.
Envirosight LLC, 2:11-cv-00210-PGS-ES, U.S. District Court,
District of New Jersey (Newark). </p>

<p>Leahy Proposes Change to Hollywood-Backed Anti-Piracy Measure </p>
<p>The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee proposed
changing a Hollywood-backed anti-piracy bill that has drawn
objections from Google Inc. (GOOG), Facebook Inc. and other Internet
companies. </p>
<p>Senator Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, said yesterday
he would submit an amendment requiring further study on a
provision requiring Internet-service providers, when served with
a court order, to block websites selling pirated content or
counterfeit goods. The full Senate is scheduled to hold a
procedural vote on the measure, the Protect IP Act, on Jan. 24. </p>
<p>Leahy has continued to hear concerns about the Domain
Name provision from engineers, human rights groups and others,
the senator said in an e-mailed statement, adding that he''s
prepared to recommend we give it more study before
implementing it.'''' </p>
<p>The bill, which has more than 40 Senate co-sponsors and was
approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee in May, would still
let the Justice Department seek court orders requiring search
engines, payment services and advertising networks to block or
cease business with non-U.S. sites linked to piracy. </p>
<p>The Senate measure and a similar House bill are backed by
the movie and music industries as a way to crack down on sales
of illegally copied content. Internet companies are waging a
campaign to block the legislation, saying it will spur online
censorship and threaten the growth of the technology industry. </p>
<p>The House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to resume
consideration of the House version of the bill, the Stop Online
Piracy Act, when Congress returns from its recess. The committee
hasn''t set a date. </p>
<p>Taiwan Museum Employees Indicted Over Unauthorized Copying </p>

<p>Persian Carpet Wins Default Judgment Over Ginkgo'' Rug Design </p>
<p>Persian Carpet Co., a carpet wholesaler and manufacturer
based in Durham, North Carolina, won a copyright infringement
case against a New York-based carpet importer. </p>
<p>The suit, filed in federal court in North Carolina in
August 2010, was related to The Ginkgo, a rug design created
in 1997 by Persian Carpet. The company claimed that Tashi Dhan
Galaicha Udhyog had made and sold hundreds of copies of the
Ginkgo design. </p>
<p>According to one website through which Persian Carpet''s
products are sold, The Ginkgo is a carpet containing
botanical elements of a ginkgo leaf, using the symmetrical
patterns of the Prairie Style. Rugs from Persian Carpet sell for
$35 per square foot. </p>
<p>In an order signed by U.S. District Judge Thomas D.
Schroeder, Persian Carpet was awarded damages in excess of
$302,000 and another $6,000 for attorney fees and litigation
costs. The defendants were ordered to quit selling copies of the
Ginkgo carpet and to destroy all infringing rugs in their
possession. </p>
<p>Tashi Dhan Galaicha Udhyog didn''t respond to the complaint
and the court entered a default judgment against the rug
importer. </p>
<p>Persian Carpet was represented by Larry L. Coats of Coats 
Bennett PLLC of Cary, North Carolina. </p>
<p>The case is The Persian Carpet Inc. v. Tashi Dhan Galaicha

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX) plans to make a final
investment decision on its offshore Bangka gas field in
Indonesia''s East Kalimantan province in 2013, according to
BPMigas, the nation''s oil and gas regulator. </p>
<p>Chevron will need to sign contracts with BPMigas including
natural gas sales accords and an extension of a production
sharing contract in the Makassar Straits before making its final
investment decision, BPMigas Chairman R. Priyono said in a
statement posted on the regulator''s website today. Gareth
Johnstone, a spokesman for Chevron in Singapore, did not
immediately comment when contacted by e-mail and phone today.
The company is continuing to advance the Bangka project
through its design phase, Chevron said Dec. 21. </p>
<p>Indonesia, Southeast Asia''s largest crude producer, is
struggling to stem a decline in output from aging oil and gas
fields that led to the country withdrawing from the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries in 2008. </p>
<p>The project can''t be delayed because it is very
strategic, said Priyono. A one-day delay could cause a loss
of tens of billions rupiah for the government. </p>
<p>Bangka, which is one of three sections of Chevron''s deep
sea natural gas project off East Kalimantan, may start
production in 2015, the regulator said in a Dec. 16
presentation. The field is expected to have peak production of
110 million cubic feet a day, Gde Pradnyana, a BPMigas
spokesman, said Dec. 21. </p>

<p>A Morgan Stanley (MS) real estate fund
agreed to buy the largest mall in central St. Petersburg,
Russia, for about $1.1 billion, according to two people with
knowledge of the transaction. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund VII will purchase the
Galeria center from Meridian Capital CIS Fund, which is run by a
buyout firm backed by a group of Kazakh investors including
Askar Alshinbaev, the people said. They declined to be
identified because the transaction is private and won''t be
completed until later this month. </p>
<p>Galeria, which cost $380 million to build and opened in
November 2010, has 250 stores occupying 93,000 square meters (1
million square feet) over five floors, according to Mace, one of
the construction companies that built the facility. The mall,
located on the intersection of Logovsky Prospekt and Nevsky
Prospekt near the city''s Moscow railroad station, features a
multi-screen movie theater, a 27-lane bowling alley plus
underground parking for 1,200 vehicles. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley spokesman Tom Walton declined to comment.
Meridian Capital didn''t return a call seeking comment and its
broker, Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. (JLL), also declined to comment
through Moscow-based spokeswoman Natalia Kopeychenko. </p>
<p>The purchase takes the Morgan Stanley fund a step closer to
investing money that its backers committed in June 2010. So far,
the fund has invested less than half of the $4 billion currently
at its disposal. </p>
<p>China Investment </p>
<p>MSREF VII''s backers, which include China Investment Corp.,
Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Government of Singapore
Investment Corp., extended the deadline for the fund to invest
all the money it raised by a year to June 2013. They also
negotiated lower management fees and a $700 million reduction in
their commitments to the fund. </p>
<p>Russian commercial real-estate sales totaled about 5
billion euros ($6.3 billion) last year, 15 percent less than in
2010, according to data compiled by Real Capital Analytics Inc.,
a New York-based research firm. That''s 48 percent less than the
investment in 2008, the data show. </p>
<p>Rising retail sales and Russia''s lack of modern mall space
has fueled a boom in shopping centers in Russia. </p>
<p>Wage Increases </p>
<p>Russians'' wages rose by an annual 7.1 percent after
inflation in November, the biggest increase in more than three
years, the Federal Statistics Service said last month. This
contributed to an 8.6 percent increase in retail sales, separate
figures showed. </p>
<p>Russia''s economy may have grown by 4.5 percent last year,
exceeding the government''s official forecast, because of the
strength of consumer spending, Deputy Economy Minister Andrei Klepach said Dec. 12. </p>
<p>That increase in demand is persuading owners of
international brands, seeking sales growth outside western
Europe and the U.S., to open stores in Russia. Developers will
open almost 3 million square meters of mall space in the country
in the 18 months to the end of 2012, according to research by
Cushman  Wakefield Inc. </p>
<p>The broker estimates that Russia has about 80.5 square
meters of mall space per 1,000 inhabitants, compared with an
average 240.3 square meters in the European Union. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and the German
city of Pforzheim should settle a dispute over 56 million euros
($71 million) in losses on an interest-rate swap, a judge said. </p>
<p>The city should accept one-third of the amount, Presiding
Judge Daniel Koehler told the parties at a hearing in Frankfurt
today. While the city may win the case if it can prove that it
wasn''t properly informed about the initial market value of the
derivative, this isn''t guaranteed and proceedings may drag on
for a long time, he said. </p>
<p>A settlement would pour money in the city''s coffers right
away, Koehler said. The amounts at stake aren''t peanuts and
both sides face considerable risks in this case. </p>
<p>The city of Pforzheim is among several European
municipalities that lost millions of euros on derivative
transactions that went sour. After Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Germany''s
biggest bank, lost a case over interest-rate swaps at Germany''s
highest civil court last year, cities and small companies are
trying to recover their losses in court. </p>
<p>Lawyers for the city said the settlement amount proposed by
the judge wouldn''t be acceptable and that the city council must
consider the issue. JPMorgan''s lawyer said he will discuss the
proposal with his client. The court scheduled a ruling for March
23. </p>
<p>Deutsche Bank Mirror </p>
<p>Pforzheim bought the swap to mirror a derivative it had
acquired from Deutsche Bank that accumulated 20 million euros of
losses. Over time, the Deutsche Bank transaction turned
positive, while the swap from JPMorgan incurred about 60 million
euros in losses. </p>
<p>Under most interest-rate swap agreements sold to utilities,
medium-size companies and cities, the lender paid a fixed rate
and the customer an amount based on Euribor rates. </p>
<p>The top court''s reasoning in the Deutsche Bank ruling would
apply in this case, so JPMorgan had a duty to disclose any
negative market value, Judge Koehler said. While the city had
experience with swaps and the negotiations were handled by two
women with some knowledge in the area, that didn''t exclude the
bank''s duty to advise its customer, he said. The court''s
assessment is preliminary, the judge added. </p>
<p>It''s pretty much like in the top court case, there was
also a person with some economic education on the customer
side, Koehler said. Our top court tends to increase the
consumer-like protection it grants cities and small business. </p>
<p>Pforzheim claims it didn''t know the negative market value
was 23 million euros instead of 20 million euros. JPMorgan
lawyer Carsten van de Sande told the court the bank always made
clear its profit margin and structuring cost for the instrument
were priced into the swap. </p>
<p>You can'' take a chance without any risk, said van de
Sande. Pforzheim could also have decided to simply pay back
the 20 millon euros to Deutsche Bank at the time and not buy the
swap from JPMorgan. </p>
<p>Today''s case is LG Frankfurt, 2-25 O 669/10. </p>

<p>A shale-driven glut of natural gas
has cut electricity prices for the U.S. power industry by 50
percent and reduced investment in costlier sources of energy. </p>
<p>With abundant new supplies of gas making it the cheapest
option for new power generation, the largest U.S. wind-energy
producer, NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE), has shelved plans for new U.S.
wind projects next year and Exelon Corp. (EXC) called off plans to
expand two nuclear plants. Michigan utility CMS Energy Corp. (CMS)
canceled a $2 billion coal plant after deciding it wasn''t
financially viable in a time of low natural-gas prices linked
to expanded shale-gas supplies, according to a company
statement. </p>
<p>Mirroring the gas market, wholesale electricity prices have
dropped more than 50 percent on average since 2008, and about 10
percent during the fourth quarter of 2011, according to a   Jan.
11 research report by Aneesh Prabhu, a New York-based credit
analyst with Standard  Poor''s Financial Services LLC. Prices in
the west hub of PJM Interconnection LLC, the largest wholesale
market in the U.S., declined to about $39 per megawatt hour by
December 2011 from $87 in the first quarter of 2008. </p>
<p>Power producers'' profits are deflated by cheap gas because
electricity pricing historically has been linked to the gas
market. As profit margins shrink from falling prices, more
generators are expected to postpone or abandon coal, nuclear and
wind projects, decisions that may slow the shift to cleaner
forms of energy and shape the industry for decades to come, Mark
Pruitt, a Chicago-based independent industry consultant, said in
a telephone interview. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)''s computer-network-
management software, a product that Chief Executive Officer
Steve Ballmer once came close to scrapping, emerges today as the
cornerstone of a bid to challenge VMware Inc. </p>
<p>A new version of System Center 2012 will be released as
part of its final testing phase, said Brad Anderson, a vice
president in Microsoft''s management and security division. The
software is used with Windows and virtualization software,
letting companies turn their servers into so-called private
clouds. The offering is cheaper than VMware''s competing product
and has equivalent features, Anderson said. </p>
<p>Companies use cloud computing to store and run programs via
the Internet. While the approach spares them from having to
store data locally, many businesses want to run them in-house
for better control; hence, the appeal of private clouds. Though
VMware has an edge in this area, Microsoft should pose a
stronger challenge this year, said Al Gillen, an analyst at
Framingham, Massachusetts-based research firm IDC. </p>
<p>The stage is being set for a very brutal competition
between Microsoft and VMware, he said. You are going to see
a lot of focus around price. Until now, VMware''s (VMW) functionality
has been so much better that they haven''t had to compete on
price. That''s going to change. </p>
<p>One of the goals of cloud computing is to give customers
access to a pool of computing power and storage that can easily
be assigned to a particular program, without the need for
information-technology staff. </p>
<p>Public and Private </p>
<p>Companies like Microsoft and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) that run
public clouds use their own data centers to store and operate
programs for customers. In a private cloud, the client wants the
same flexibility, cost savings and ease of use in their own data
centers. While that requires virtualization software to combine
multiple programs on one server, it also relies on network-
management software like System Center, Anderson said. </p>
<p>Cloud has been a key factor in the rising importance of
Microsoft''s management software. When Anderson joined the
company in 2003 from Novell Inc. (NOVL), he said the product, then
called Systems Management Server, was largely used to help
companies roll out programs and security patches to workers. </p>
<p>Development was running more than two years late and
unbeknownst to Anderson at the time, Ballmer had told the
leadership team that if the schedule slipped again, he would
cancel the product. After a few weeks at Microsoft, Anderson sat
in his first meeting with Chairman Bill Gates, who asked him why
the company needed it at all. </p>
<p>Billion-Dollar Sales </p>
<p>At the time, Microsoft got about $250 million in annual
sales from management software, Anderson said. Two years ago,
the business broke the $1 billion mark, he said. Anderson
declined to provide more recent revenue numbers. VMware, based
in Palo Alto, California, doesn''t break out revenue for its
equivalent business line. </p>
<p>Even with the growth, Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft
hasn''t been able to compete on a par with VMware, Anderson said.
Four years ago, at meetings with customers at a Microsoft
conference in Barcelona, Spain, that message was clear, he said. </p>
<p>I came away feeling we have a lot of work to do, he
said. That even though their price was 5X ours, we didn''t have
the capabilities to even have that conversation. </p>
<p>In recent years, with improvements to the management tools,
as well as Windows Server and Microsoft''s Hyper-V virtualization
software, that''s starting to change. After the debut of the last
test version today, the final System Center 2012 will be
released in the first half of the year. </p>
<p>Unilever, Lufthansa </p>
<p>Microsoft, the world''s largest software maker, counts
Unilever NV (UNA) among its private-cloud customers, Anderson said. </p>
<p>VMware still has an advantage because of its leading role
in virtualization software, which gives more flexibility to
servers. Microsoft''s Hyper-V product has 25 percent of the
market, according to IDC, compared with VMware''s 52 percent. </p>
<p>Companies that already have VMware installed will stick
with it if they opt for private clouds, Gillen said. Still,
Microsoft will provide stronger competition for new projects, he
said. </p>
<p>This is the release that gets them really into the
private-cloud conversation, said Mary Johnston Turner, also an
analyst at IDC. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) climbed 6.8
percent in New York trading after the bank reported profit that
exceeded analysts'' estimates, helped by a reduction in
compensation costs. </p>
<p>The shares rose $6.63 to $104.31 at 4:15 p.m., after
reaching $105.83 earlier today. Fourth-quarter net income at the
New York-based company dropped 58 percent to $1.01 billion, or
$1.84 a share, beating the $1.23 average estimate of 26 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 57, cut
compensation 21 percent in 2011 as he reduced costs and focused
on international growth to offset a slowdown in trading, which
contributes most of the firm''s revenue. Goldman Sachs''s higher-
than-estimated earnings contrasted with previous reports from
Citigroup Inc. (C), which fell short of analysts'' estimates, and
JPMorgan Chase  Co., which matched projections. </p>
<p>When you do have challenges on the top line, the first
thing you look at as a securities analyst is are you managing
your costs?'' William Fitzpatrick, a Milwaukee-based financial-
services analyst at Manulife Asset Management, said on Bloomberg
Television''s InsideTrack. We''ve seen a couple of the banks
who aren''t necessarily doing that very well, but Goldman Sachs
clearly has a good handle on that. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs reduced the amount of revenue it paid out in
compensation during the fourth quarter to 36.5 percent, while
analysts including Ed Najarian at International Strategy 
Investment Group Inc. were expecting a ratio closer to 43
percent. The company''s tax rate fell to 28 percent for the year,
compared with 30.3 percent for the first nine months. </p>
<p>Cost Cuts </p>
<p>The firm''s target is to reduce annual costs by $1.4
billion, more than the initial $1.2 billion goal set in the
middle of last year, David A. Viniar, Goldman Sachs''s chief
financial officer, said on a conference call with investors
today. The company eliminated 2,400 jobs last year and reduced
the size of its balance sheet to $923 billion at the end of the
year from $949 billion three months earlier, the first quarterly
decline since the end of 2009. </p>
<p>While it is not possible to cut expenses as a means to
prosperity, we understand the benefits of a proactive and
disciplined approach particularly if the operating environment
remains challenging, Viniar said. </p>
<p>At the same time, Viniar echoed recent comments by
Blankfein that the firm expects business to rebound. He compared
the current slowdown with the collapse of hedge fund Long-Term
Capital Management LP in late 1998, the decline in technology
stocks in 2000 and the credit crisis in 2008. </p>
<p>Different World </p>
<p>We''ve seen downturns before, he said. Every time
you''re in one if feels like it''s never going to end and that the
world is different now. I wouldn''t say, for example, that the
environment feels worse than it felt in the fall of 2008 or
necessarily after the tech bubble burst, nor necessarily after
the fall of 1998. </p>
<p>Net income for the year fell 47 percent to $4.44 billion,
the lowest since 2008. Return on average common shareholders''
equity, known as ROE, was 3.7 percent for the year, down from
11.5 percent in 2010. </p>
<p>Yes, we''re going to be prudent in managing our capital,
yes we''re going to be prudent in managing our expenses, Viniar
said today. But our ROE growth is going to largely be driven
by growing our revenues, expanding our footprint, expanding our
client base and growing the firm. </p>
<p>Revenue Miss </p>
<p>Revenue for 2011 dropped 26 percent to $28.8 billion, the
lowest since 2008, and declined 30 percent in the fourth quarter
to $6.05 billion. The average estimate of 18 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg was for $6.39 billion in fourth-quarter revenue. </p>
<p>Compensation, the company''s biggest expense, decreased to
$12.2 billion for the full year and fell 2 percent to $2.21
billion in the fourth quarter. The cost was 42.4 percent of
total revenue for the full year. The total number of employees
fell to 33,300 at the end of December from 34,200 three months
earlier and from 35,700 a year earlier. </p>
<p>Discretionary compensation for 2011, which refers to cash
and equity bonuses, declined significantly more than revenue
on a full-year basis, Viniar said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s larger New York-based rivals have also
suffered from the decline in trading. Citigroup, the third-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, said yesterday that fourth-quarter
net income dropped 11 percent as lower revenue from advising
companies and trading securities led to the first quarterly loss
at its investment bank since 2008. JPMorgan, the biggest U.S.
bank, said last week that fourth-quarter net income slid 23
percent as investment bank earnings fell by half. </p>
<p>Encouraging Signs'' </p>
<p>As economies and markets improve -- and we see
encouraging signs of this -- Goldman Sachs is very well
positioned to perform for our clients and our shareholders,
Blankfein said in the company''s statement today. </p>
<p>In the last year Goldman Sachs lost about 50 partners, the
highest rank of employees who share in a special compensation
pool and are elected every two years. Among the departures were
six members of the management committee, including trading co-
heads Edward K. Eisler, 42, and David B. Heller, 44, last week. </p>
<p>Viniar said that fewer partners than normal left the firm
over the last four years because they wanted to remain loyal to
Goldman Sachs as it navigated the aftermath of the financial
crisis and blows to its reputation such as the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission''s 2010 lawsuit against the firm. </p>
<p>Partnership Turnover </p>
<p>You tend to find 15 percent to 20 percent of our
partnership turning over every two years, Viniar said. It''s
been like that almost through our history, and you saw far less
than that turning over the last four years. And I think what
you''re seeing now is, as I said, normal progression. </p>
<p>Institutional client services, the division that handles
sales and trading for customers, generated $3.06 billion in the
fourth quarter, down 16 percent from the same period of 2010.
The business, now supervised by Isabelle Ealet, Pablo J. Salame
and Harvey M. Schwartz, made $17.3 billion in full-year revenue,
down from $21.8 billion in 2010. </p>
<p>Fixed-income, currency and commodities trading contributed
$1.36 billion of revenue for the quarter and $9.02 billion for
the year, down from $1.64 billion in the fourth quarter of 2010
and $13.7 billion for that full year. JPMorgan (JPM) last week said
its investment bank produced $2.49 billion of fixed-income
trading revenue in the quarter and $15.3 billion for the year. </p>
<p>Accounting Gains </p>
<p>The company''s 2011 trading revenue included about $600
million in accounting gains related to the widening of the
company''s credit spreads during the year, Goldman Sachs said in
the statement. The effect of such adjustments in the fourth
quarter was not material, the company added. </p>
<p>Equities, the business that Heller supervised, made $1.69
billion in fourth-quarter revenue, down from $2 billion, and
$8.26 billion for the year, up from $8.1 billion in 2010. That
compares with JPMorgan''s $779 million in fourth-quarter equities
revenue and $4.83 billion for the year. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs boosted its value-at-risk, the maximum amount
the company estimates it could lose from trading on 95 percent
of days, to $135 million in the fourth quarter -- the highest
level since the second quarter of 2010 -- from $102 million in
the prior quarter, the statement showed. The increase was driven
by significantly greater volatility in the interest-rate
category, Viniar said. </p>
<p>China Investment </p>
<p>Investing  Lending, which includes the firm''s gains and
losses on its own stakes in companies, funds and securities,
produced $872 million in fourth-quarter revenue, a 56 percent
drop, and $2.14 billion for the year, a 72 percent decline.
Gains from Goldman Sachs''s holding in Industrial  Commercial
Bank of China Ltd., the country''s biggest lender, jumped to $388
million in the quarter from $55 million a year earlier. The
investment recorded a loss of $517 million for the year,
compared with a $747 million gain in 2010. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s investment-banking division, managed
worldwide by Richard J. Gnodde, David M. Solomon and John S. Weinberg, made $857 million in revenue for the quarter, down 43
percent from $1.51 billion a year earlier. Revenue for the full
year slid 9 percent to $4.36 billion. JPMorgan made $1.12
billion in fourth-quarter investment-banking fees and a full-
year total of $5.86 billion. </p>
<p>The company''s investment-banking transaction backlog, a
measure of assignments that haven''t yet been completed, fell in
the fourth quarter compared with the third and was higher than a
year earlier, according to the statement. </p>
<p>Financial Advisory </p>
<p>Revenue from financial advisory, which includes the mergers
and acquisitions business led globally by Gene T. Sykes in Los
Angeles and London-based Yoel Zaoui, decreased 25 percent in the
fourth quarter to $470 million and retreated 4 percent for the
year to $1.99 billion. Goldman Sachs ranked No. 1 among advisers
on global takeovers in 2011 for the first time since 2008,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Fourth-quarter revenue from equity underwriting, led by
London-based Matthew Westerman, decreased 66 percent to $191
million and declined 26 percent to $1.09 billion for the full
year. The bank ranked No. 1 in managing equity, equity-linked
and rights sales in 2011 for the first time since 2006, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Debt-underwriting revenue was down
40 percent in the fourth quarter to $196 million and was
virtually unchanged for the year at $1.28 billion. </p>
<p>Investment management, overseen by Timothy O''Neill and Eric S. Lane since the retirement of Edward C. Forst at year-end,
made $1.26 billion in fourth-quarter revenue and $5.03 billion
for the full year. That compares with $1.51 billion in the
fourth quarter of 2010 and $5.01 billion for the full year.
Assets under management climbed to $828 billion from $821
billion three months earlier and compared with $840 billion a
year earlier. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
reported that 2011 profit fell to the lowest level since 2008,
spent more to buy back stock than it earned in the year. </p>
<p>The company spent $6.04 billion to repurchase 47 million
shares at an average price of $128.33, more than its $4.44
billion in net income, the New York-based bank said today. It
also paid $1.93 billion in preferred stock dividends during the
year, including $1.64 billion to redeem an investment by Warren Buffett''s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. </p>
<p>The Federal Reserve and other regulators around the world
have encouraged banks to boost capital to meet requirements
established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Under
the Fed''s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR,
U.S. lenders must prove they have enough capital to withstand a
severe U.S. recession before they can increase dividends or
repurchase shares. </p>
<p>We put in what we want to do and the Fed tells us yes or
no, David A. Viniar, Goldman Sachs''s chief financial officer,
told analysts when asked how the bank was able to spend more on
buybacks than it earns. I don''t think you should expect that
it will be a long-term sustainable way we do things of buying
back more than earnings. </p>
<p>Viniar estimated that Goldman Sachs had so-called Tier 1
common equity equal to just under 8 percent of the bank''s risk-
weighted assets at the end of 2011 under the Basel III
requirements. Based on analysts'' current estimates for the
bank''s earnings and the maturity of some assets, Viniar said the
capital would be a little bit below 11 percent of assets at
the end of 2013. </p>

<p>The fund, Broad Street Energy Partners, will invest

<p>Goldman Sachs joins a growing lineup of firms raising pools
of capital to take advantage of increased demand for energy and

are also marketing debut energy funds. </p>
<p>Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, declined

<p>The new fund will be managed by the principal investment

and a managing director in the merchant-banking division at
Goldman Sachs, is heading the effort, according to the
investors. </p>
<p>The Goldman Sachs merchant-banking division has made energy

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) asked a New

complaint. </p>
<p>Basis Yield Alpha Fund, a unit of Australian hedge fund
Basis Capital Funds Management Ltd., sued Goldman Sachs in New
York State Supreme Court in October, accusing the bank of making
false and misleading statements and omissions in connection with
the sale of securities known as Timberwolf and Point Pleasant. </p>
<p>Basis Yield agreed that any disputes connected to the
investments would be subject to binding arbitration when it
opened its trading account, New York-based Goldman Sachs said in
court documents filed yesterday. </p>
<p>The case should be dismissed if arbitration isn''t ordered
because it lacks a substantial nexus to New York, and
because the losses from the investments were caused by the
collapse of the mortgage market and not by misrepresentations,
Goldman Sachs said in the filings. </p>
<p>Not only are subjective opinions as to market direction
inactionable, but defendants had no crystal ball as to market
direction any more than did BYAFM or any other investor,
Goldman Sachs said in the court documents. </p>
<p>A June 2010 lawsuit by Basis Capital over the securities
was dismissed last year by U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones in
Manhattan, who ruled the Australian fund couldn''t use U.S.

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the New

its compensation and benefits expense 21 percent to
$12.2 billion in 2011 as revenue slid 26 percent. </p>
<p>The expense for salary, bonuses and benefits, the company''s
biggest cost, was enough to provide $367,057 to each of its
33,300 employees. That''s down from $430,700 for each of the
35,700 workers at the end of 2010, according to data provided
today in the firm''s fourth-quarter earnings statement. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which set a record for securities-firm pay
in 2007, reduced compensation for the third year in a row after
earnings skidded and protesters denounced Wall Street bonuses.
JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest and most profitable U.S. bank,

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX) lost another bid
before a U.S appeals court for an order blocking enforcement of
an Ecuadorean court''s $18 billion environmental damages verdict. </p>
<p>Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, had asked a
panel of judges at the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York to set
aside its Sept. 19 ruling rejecting a trial judge''s decision in
March that blocked collection of the Ecuadorean judgment. The
company also asked for a rehearing on the merits of its appeal. </p>
<p>In a related decision, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan
this month refused Chevron''s request to restrain Ecuadorean
assets that could be seized as part of the Ecuadorean judgment. </p>
<p>Chevron was ordered on Feb. 14 to pay as much as $18
billion in compensatory and punitive damages for Texaco Inc.''s
alleged dumping of toxic drilling wastes in the Ecuadorean
jungle from 1964 to about 1992. The ruling came in an 18-year-
old lawsuit decided by a judge in Lago Agrio, a provincial
capital near the Colombian border. </p>
<p>Dumped'' </p>
<p>Karen Hinton, a spokeswoman for the plaintiffs, said that
Ecuadorean communities affected by the contamination are one
step closer to justice as a result of today''s ruling. </p>
<p>For almost two decades, Chevron has stood in the way of a
comprehensive cleanup of billions of gallons of crude oil and
toxic waste water it deliberately dumped into the pristine
rainforest, Hinton said in an e-mailed statement. Thousands
of people have died or suffered as the oil giant and its legions
of lawyers have fought to distract attention from the
overwhelming evidence against the company. </p>
<p>On Jan. 3, an Ecuadorean appeals court upheld the February
ruling in all of its parts, including the conviction for moral
reparation or its alternative and costs, according to the
decision. Chevron can appeal the decision to the next level of
Ecuador''s judiciary, a company spokesman said at the time. </p>
<p>Full Opinion </p>
<p>The U.S. appeals panel in September rejected Kaplan''s March
decision blocking collection of the Ecuadorean judgment pending
resolution of a lawsuit alleging that the plaintiffs engaged in
fraud to win the case. The appeals court hasn''t issued a full
opinion in the matter. </p>
<p>Chevron denies wrongdoing in the Lago Agrio lawsuit. The
company says Texaco cleaned up its share of the pollution at its
former oil fields, which were taken over by PetroEcuador,
Ecuador''s state-owned oil company. Chevron says it was released
from any future liability by an agreement between Texaco and
Ecuador. Chevron acquired Texaco in 2001. </p>
<p>Chevron filed a claim in 2009 against Ecuador in the
Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague seeking orders that
it has no liability for the environmental pollution and that
PetroEcuador should pay the damage award. In those proceedings,
Ecuador was told in February to prevent enforcement of the
judgment until further order by the tribunal, Chevron said on
Jan. 3. </p>
<p>Chevron Disappointed </p>
<p>Chevron said it is disappointed with today''s decision and
awaits the court''s final ruling. </p>
<p>Chevron will also continue to prepare to resist any
efforts by the plaintiffs to enforce the judgment in other
countries in the event Ecuador chooses to defy the tribunal''s
order, the company said in a statement. Chevron has
uncovered overwhelming evidence of fraud and does not believe
that the Ecuador ruling is enforceable in any court that
observes the rule of law. </p>
<p>The San Ramon, California-based company alleged in a U.S.
suit before Kaplan that lawyers for the Ecuadoreans conspired to
fabricate evidence. Attorneys for the Latin American plaintiffs
said the lawsuit is an unjustified attempt to derail the
pollution lawsuit damages. </p>
<p>The racketeering case is Chevron v. Donziger, 11-00691,
U.S. District Court, District of New York (Manhattan). The case
in Ecuador is Maria Aquinda v. Chevron, 002-2003, Superior Court
of Nueva Loja, Lago Agrio, Ecuador. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world''s biggest computer-services provider, forecast
2012 earnings exceeding analysts'' estimates after fourth-quarter
profit rose 4.4 percent because of rising software demand. </p>
<p>Earnings, excluding some items, will increase to at least
$14.85 a share this year, Armonk, New York-based IBM said today.
Analysts projected $14.81, the average of estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Fourth-quarter operating earnings advanced to $4.71 a
share, beating the $4.62 analysts predicted. </p>
<p>Virginia Ginni Rometty succeeded Sam Palmisano this
month, becoming the first female chief executive officer in the
company''s 100-year history. She inherits a five-year plan that
includes boosting software to half of IBM''s earnings, with a
focus on programs that help businesses analyze and project
trends, as well as on cloud computing and emerging markets. </p>
<p>Software was a relative strength, Shebly Seyrafi, an
analyst at FBN Securities in New York with a sector perform
rating on the stock, said in an interview. It''s a bit
relieving that IBM, which is a bellwether in technology, did not
disappoint investors. </p>
<p>Sales increased 1.6 percent to $29.5 billion, compared with
the $29.7 billion analysts had predicted. The euro declined 3.2
percent against the dollar last year amid Europe''s debt crisis.
The drop means revenue from Europe, which combined with Middle
East and Africa accounts for almost a third of IBM''s sales, is
worth less when converted to dollars. </p>
<p>Rometty''s Moves </p>
<p>IBM gained as much as 3.9 percent to $187.50 in extended
trading, after closing at $180.52. The shares reached a record
in 2011 and rose 25 percent for the year. They had lost 1.8
percent this year as of today''s close. </p>
<p>Rometty, 54, formerly IBM''s sales and marketing head, took
the helm Jan. 1 after the succession was announced in October.
Palmisano, who had been CEO since 2002, remains chairman. </p>
<p>In her first promotions this month, Rometty named Bruno Di Leo as sales and distribution chief and Bridget Van Kralingen as
head of consulting, replacing a retiring Frank Kern. She also
named James Bramante senior vice president of growth markets, an
elevated title as IBM seeks to boost the unit''s sales. </p>
<p>IBM has set goals of adding $20 billion in new revenue,
including spending about $20 billion on acquisitions, from 2010
through 2015, as it expands offerings to business customers. </p>
<p>Growth Markets </p>
<p>Fourth-quarter net income rose to $5.49 billion, or $4.62 a
share, from $5.26 billion, or $4.18 a share, a year earlier.
Operating earnings a year earlier were $4.25 a share. </p>
<p>Profit expansion this year will be more skewed to the
second half, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on a
conference call today. IBM has said it targets annual operating
earnings of at least $20 a share by 2015. </p>
<p>We are well on track toward our long-term roadmap for
operating earnings, Rometty said in the statement. We
continued to realize the benefit of our long-term investments in
growth markets, business analytics, Smarter Planet solutions and
cloud. </p>
<p>Sales at IBM''s software unit rose about 9 percent to $7.6
billion, boosted by demand for brands such as Tivoli and Lotus.
Services revenue growth slowed to 3 percent from the third
quarter''s 8 percent, while hardware sales fell 8 percent. </p>
<p>Backlog, which measures expected future revenue from
contracts, totaled $141 billion in the quarter, up $4 billion
from the third quarter. Contract signings for services, which
make up about 60 percent of IBM revenue, fell 8 percent from a
year earlier to $20.4 billion. </p>
<p>Services revenue will rise at least 3 percent this year,
based on the backlog growth, Loughridge said. </p>
<p>We continue to build our momentum in software, he said.
Our services business delivered powerful margin and profit
growth. </p>
<p>Revenue from growth markets, such as Brazil, India and
China, increased 7 percent in the fourth quarter. Sales from the
regions will make up at least 30 percent of revenue by 2015, the
company has said, up from 22 percent in 2011. </p>

<p>Microsoft (MSFT) Corp., the world''s largest
software maker, reported second-quarter profit that beat
estimates, lifted by holiday sales of Xbox machines and Kinect
sensors, as well as corporate software demand. </p>
<p>Net income was $6.62 billion, or 78 cents a share, compared
with $6.63 billion, or 77 cents, a year earlier, Microsoft said
today in a statement. Sales rose to $20.9 billion, matching
estimates. Analysts had predicted 76 cents in profit on average,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s Xbox business got a boost from Christmas
shoppers, who snapped up its video-game consoles and Kinect
sensor controllers, and signed up for the Xbox Live online
service. That helped make up for Windows sales hurt by sluggish
demand for personal computers and a shortage of hard drives
stemming from floods in Thailand. </p>
<p>Xbox looks strong and Xbox Live looks really strong,
said Kim Caughey Forrest, an analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group
Inc., which owns Microsoft shares. Sales of Office programs also
performed well, she said. Those were all good things to see. </p>
<p>Microsoft shares rose in extended trading after the report.
The stock, which declined 7 percent last year, had decreased
less than 1 percent to close at $28.12 in regular trading. </p>
<p>Lower Costs </p>
<p>Microsoft also lowered its operating-cost projections. In
the fiscal year that began July 1, the expenses will be $28.5
billion to $28.9 billion, down from an October forecast for
$28.6 billion to $29.2 billion. </p>
<p>Unearned revenue, a measure of future sales, was $15.3
billion, above the $15.1 billion average estimate compiled by
Bloomberg. The category shows Microsoft continues to sign
multiyear agreements with corporate customers. </p>
<p>We have some headwinds from a challenging PC market, but
Office and Server and Tools continue to grow very nicely,
Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein said in an
interview. Xbox and Xbox Live had another strong holiday
season. </p>
<p>The supply of computers to stores and companies was
hampered by flooding in Thailand, a disaster that wiped out
about a quarter of the world''s hard-drive manufacturing
capacity. That led PC shipments to decline 0.2 percent in the
fourth quarter, according to IDC, instead of the 5.1 percent
increase initially predicted. Gartner Inc., another research
firm, said PC shipments dropped 1.4 percent. </p>
<p>Threat From IPad </p>
<p>The flooding compounded the woes of PCs, which are being
pushed off consumer wish lists in favor of smartphones and Apple
Inc.''s iPad. Heather Bellini, an analyst at Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., says Windows revenue is unlikely to recover substantially
in the next few quarters. The disk-drive shortage will continue
to hurt the industry, and customers are waiting for Microsoft''s
new Windows 8 before they buy PCs, she said. </p>
<p>Drive shortages and concerns about the economy are likely
to persist throughout the March quarter, Klein said. Microsoft
may have a hard time keeping some PC users from switching to
tablets and smartphones until Windows 8 goes on sale, he said.
Klein declined to provide a release date. </p>
<p>In addition to adding new PC features, Windows 8 will have
a touch-screen interface designed for tablets and will work with
ARM Holdings Plc chip technology. That will help manufacturers
produce machines that can rival the iPad in battery life and
speed. </p>
<p>Windows Decline </p>
<p>Microsoft''s Windows division posted a 6.3 percent decline
in sales to $4.74 billion last quarter, missing the $4.9 billion
estimated by analysts. Windows revenue has fallen short of
analysts'' estimates in four of the past five quarters. </p>
<p>The Business division''s sales, largely made up of Office
products such as Word and Excel, rose 2.8 percent to $6.28
billion. That beat the $6.1 billion average estimate of
analysts. Server and tools software was $4.77 billion, compared
with the $4.8 billion average estimate. The Xbox unit posted
sales of $4.24 billion, topping the projection of $4.2 billion. </p>
<p>The Xbox business had its best week ever in terms of U.S.
sales, setting a record during the seven days after
Thanksgiving. Microsoft has now sold a total of 66 million Xbox
machines and 18 million Kinect motion sensors, which let users
control games with body motion. Forty million customers have
signed up for the company''s Xbox Live online gaming and
entertainment service, the company said earlier this month. </p>
<p>Corporate Sales </p>
<p>Microsoft has relied on corporate demand for its Office and
server software, as well as business purchases of PCs, to shore
up earnings in recent quarters. Many business customers have
multiyear agreements with Microsoft, helping insulate the
company from quarterly fluctuations in demand. </p>
<p>Klein said the company hasn''t seen any weakness in
corporate demand and isn''t expecting that to change. Products
such as the SharePoint program for hosting websites and the Lync
software for messaging and teleconferencing are selling well
among businesses, he said. </p>
<p>Even so, corporate budgets for 2012 look to be
conservative, Bellini said in a note before the earnings
report. Outside of Germany, demand in Europe will be soft,
putting pressure on Microsoft''s corporate sales for the next few
quarters, she said. </p>
<p>You have to be concerned about the corporate engine
running out of steam, said Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at
Pacific Crest Securities in Portland, Oregon, who rates the
shares sector perform. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) rose to the highest
in almost three months in New York trading after reporting a
smaller fourth-quarter loss than analysts estimated on gains in
equities trading. </p>
<p>The shares climbed 93 cents, or 5.4 percent, to $18.28 at 4
p.m., the highest since Oct. 28. The firm''s net loss was $250
million, or 15 cents a share, compared with profit of $836
million, or 41 cents, a year earlier, the New York-based company
said today in a statement. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley posted the only increase in trading revenue
excluding accounting gains among the five largest Wall Street
banks in 2011, making progress toward Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer James Gorman''s goal of boosting market share.
The firm still had per-share losses in two of the past three
quarters as it took charges to eliminate swap contracts
purchased from MBIA Inc. (MBI) and to convert Mitsubishi UFJ Financial
Group Inc.''s preferred stake to common shares. </p>
<p>Their institutional business is performing quite well
relative to the other firms, Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford
C. Bernstein  Co., said in an interview on Bloomberg
Television''s InBusiness. On the trading side, their equity
business was very strong. </p>
<p>The loss from continuing operations was 14 cents, compared
with the 57-cent average estimate of 22 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s shares gained 6.8 percent yesterday after
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reported profit that beat estimates on
compensation cuts. JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest U.S. bank
by assets, fell 2.5 percent on Jan. 13, when it reported trading
revenue dropped 11 percent from the third quarter, excluding
accounting adjustments. </p>
<p>The bar is pretty low for Morgan Stanley, said Ralph Cole, a senior vice president in research at Ferguson Wellman
Inc. in Portland, Oregon, which manages $2.8 billion. It''s
partly how they look compared to competitors. If they can show
less weakness than their peers, that appears to be strength. </p>
<p>Revenue at Morgan Stanley dropped 26 percent to $5.71
billion from a year earlier. Book value per share rose to $31.42
from $31.29 at the end of September. </p>
<p>Fourth-quarter revenue from fixed-income sales and trading,
which is run by Ken deRegt along with commodity trading co-heads
Colin Bryce and Simon Greenshields, was negative $257 million.
Excluding the MBIA charge and the effect of accounting gains
tied to the firm''s credit spreads, revenue was about $1.2
billion. That was higher than the $1.09 billion posted in the
third quarter and $813 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. </p>
<p>Fixed Income </p>
<p>Fixed-income trading revenue included about $600 million
related to the restructuring of derivatives tied to so-called
peripheral European countries. The transaction reduced the
firm''s risks before hedges by $3.38 billion, by lowering net
counterparty exposure related to Italian sovereigns, Morgan
Stanley Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in an interview. </p>
<p>Fixed-income revenue, excluding accounting gains and losses
known as DVA, was $2.63 billion at JPMorgan, $1.72 billion at
Citigroup Inc. and $1.36 billion at Goldman Sachs. All three
firms are based in New York. </p>
<p>In equities trading, headed by Ted Pick, Morgan Stanley''s
revenue was $1.28 billion, excluding DVA, up from $1.18 billion
in the fourth-quarter of 2010. That compared with the third
quarter''s $1.34 billion, and with $1.69 billion at Goldman Sachs
and $806 million at JPMorgan. </p>
<p>Broad-Based Gains </p>
<p>We had broad-based market-share gains in equities, and
very strong performance this quarter in cash equities and
electronic trading, Porat said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley generated $883 million in fourth-quarter
revenue from investment banking, which is overseen by Paul J. Taubman. That figure, down 42 percent from a year earlier,
included $406 million from financial advisory, $189 million from
equity underwriting and $288 million from debt underwriting. </p>
<p>Global wealth management, overseen by Greg Fleming, posted
pretax income of $244 million, down from $390 million in the
fourth quarter of 2010. The division''s pretax profit margin fell
to 8 percent from 10 percent in the first nine months of 2011.
Gorman has said the unit should eventually post a pretax profit
margin of more than 20 percent. </p>
<p>Smith Barney </p>
<p>Purchasing an additional 14 percent stake in the Morgan
Stanley Smith Barney brokerage joint venture with Citigroup is a
core plank of the firm''s strategy, Gorman said today on a
conference call with analysts. Whether the firm moves
immediately on that purchase when it becomes available later
this year will partly depend on price, he said. </p>
<p>Asset management reported a pretax gain of $78 million,
down from $353 million in the previous year''s period. </p>
<p>We ended the year in better shape than where we started
and we are well positioned to deliver improved returns to
shareholders in 2012 and beyond, Gorman, 53, said in the
statement. </p>
<p>Compensation and benefits decreased 6 percent from the
year-earlier quarter to $3.81 billion, or 67 percent of the
firm''s overall revenue. The ratio was higher than in the fourth
quarter of 2010, when the bank set aside 52 percent of revenue. </p>
<p>Concern that Europe''s sovereign-debt crisis would spread
led to lower trading and fewer deals in the fourth quarter.
While the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index rose 11 percent in the
period, the biggest jump in more than two years, average daily
volume on major U.S. exchanges dropped 15 percent from the third
quarter. </p>
<p>Headcount Reductions </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley responded by cutting headcount and deferring
more employee compensation, including a December announcement
that it''s eliminating 1,600 jobs. It told employees this week
that immediate cash bonuses would be capped at $125,000, with
amounts beyond that deferred over two years, according to a
person briefed on the plans. </p>
<p>Compensation and costs are things that they have some
control over, and they''re doing what they can in this tough
revenue environment, Roger Freeman, an analyst at Barclays
Capital, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television''s
InBusiness before earnings were released. Freeman has a
neutral rating on Morgan Stanley''s stock. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley took a pretax charge of $1.74 billion
related to a settlement reached last month with bond insurer
MBIA. The settlement canceled credit-default swaps bought by
Morgan Stanley from MBIA and ended lawsuits between the two
firms. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s exposure to MBIA, and its attempts to
hedge those risks, resulted in losses of about $3 billion since
the start of 2008, not including the charge taken in the fourth
quarter. The settlement will increase Morgan Stanley''s capital,
boosting the Tier 1 common ratio under new rules by about 75
basis points, the bank said last month. </p>
<p>The settlement with MBIA put our last major legacy issue
behind us while freeing up $5 billion in capital, Porat said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and
Citigroup Inc. (C) are marketing $1 billion of commercial-mortgage
bonds with lower relative yields than the most recent deals as
demand for the debt recovers. </p>
<p>A top-ranked public portion maturing in about 10 years may
yield 110 basis points more than the benchmark swap rate,
according to a person familiar with the offering who declined to
be identified because terms aren''t set. Bonds rated BBB-, being
offered privately, may pay a spread of 700 basis points more
than the benchmark, the person said. </p>
<p>UBS AG and Citigroup sold similar top-ranked debt to yield
130 basis points more than swaps in December, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman
Sachs, and Scott Helfman, a spokesman for Citigroup, declined to
comment. </p>
<p>Relative yields on commercial mortgage bonds determine how
attractive Wall Street rates are for property owners and drive
the velocity of new offerings. </p>
<p>The spread on top-ranked commercial-mortgage bonds was as
narrow as 60 basis points more than Treasuries when sales peaked
in 2007, and as wide as 14.92 percentage points in November 2008
in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point. </p>
<p>Banks pulled back from making new loans to package into
bonds in July as Europe''s debt crisis roiled credit markets and
sent spreads soaring. Originations have since picked up,
according to a Standard  Poor''s report last month. The ratings
company is forecasting $35 billion in 2012 sales. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) is reducing pay for
senior investment bankers and traders by an average of 20
percent to 30 percent for 2011 as it seeks to curb mounting
compensation costs, people with knowledge of the decision said. </p>
<p>The cuts affect employees on the executive director level
and above, one of the people said, declining to be identified
because the pay policy isn''t public. Some bankers were informed
this week, two of the people said. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, 53, vowed after
taking over in 2010 to shrink the portion of revenue devoted to
paying employees after the ratio reached 62 percent the previous
year. Excluding accounting adjustments and one-time items,
revenue at the New York-based company''s investment-banking
division fell about 2 percent last year. </p>
<p>The unit''s compensation expenses rose 3 percent, according
to figures released today. Deferred pay awarded in previous
years helped boost costs in 2011, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in an interview. Mark Lake, a spokesman for the bank,
said he couldn''t comment on pay decisions. </p>
<p>Banks worldwide have been cutting and deferring
compensation and overhauling policies for clawing back payouts
to traders and investment bankers over the past two years as
firms succumb to revenue and regulatory pressures in the wake of
2008''s financial crisis. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar said yesterday that discretionary
compensation declined significantly more than the firm''s
annual revenue, which dropped 26 percent. </p>
<p>Deferred Payouts </p>
<p>Bonuses, which are awarded early in the year for the
previous year''s performance, make up a large portion of total
pay for Wall Street employees. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, owner of the world''s largest brokerage,
told staff this month that it''s capping immediate cash bonuses
at $125,000 as the firm defers a greater share of awards to
senior executives, a person briefed on the plans said earlier
this week. </p>
<p>That decision will increase the average amount of pay
deferred to about 75 percent, the person said. That''s up from an
average of 60 percent in 2010 and 40 percent in 2009. Deferred
cash for 2011 performance will be paid out in two equal
installments in the final month of 2012 and 2013, a change from
the previous deferral plan that paid out in thirds over 18
months, the person had said. </p>
<p>Average Payouts </p>
<p>Companywide compensation and benefits at Morgan Stanley
rose 3 percent to $16.4 billion as revenue climbed at the same
rate. That was enough to pay each of the firm''s 61,899 employees
$264,996 on average for the year, more than the $254,596 it set
aside for each of the 62,542 employees at the end of 2010,
according to figures released today. The bank doesn''t report how
many people work in institutional securities. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs reduced its compensation and benefits expense
21 percent to $12.2 billion in 2011. The expense was enough to
provide $367,057 to each of its 33,300 employees, down from
$430,700 for each of the 35,700 workers at the end of 2010. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest and most profitable U.S.
bank, reported last week that it lowered pay at its investment
bank 9 percent in 2011, enough to pay each worker an average
$341,552. </p>

the overall compensation pool by the number of employees, and
they don''t represent individual workers'' actual pay. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, set aside $7.2 billion to pay employees at
its investment banking division in 2011, 3 percent more than a
year earlier, as the unit''s revenue climbed 6 percent. </p>
<p>Compensation at the institutional-securities unit, which
includes salaries, bonuses and benefits for traders and bankers,
was 42 percent of revenue, down from 43 percent in 2010 and from
56 percent in 2009, according to figures posted on the New York-
based firm''s website. </p>
<p>The division''s fourth-quarter pay expense fell 12 percent
from a year earlier, following rivals Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
and JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s investment bank in lowering costs.
Morgan Stanley said last month it plans to cut 1,600 jobs.
Goldman Sachs disclosed yesterday that it eliminated 2,400
positions and reduced full-year compensation 21 percent in 2011. </p>
<p>I think there''s more to come, William Fitzpatrick, a
Milwaukee-based financial-services analyst at Manulife Asset
Management, said on Bloomberg Television''s InsideTrack
before the results were released. The industry is undergoing
some changes here, and some are more structural than cyclical. </p>
<p>Companywide compensation and benefits at Morgan Stanley
rose 3 percent to $16.4 billion as revenue climbed at the same
rate. That was enough to pay each of the firm''s 61,899 employees

<p>Brokerage Unit </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s brokerage division, which employed 17,156
financial advisers at the end of December, down from 18,043 a
year earlier, set aside $8.35 billion for pay, 6 percent more
than in 2010. The unit''s compensation cost, which is set by a
fixed grid for many employees, was 62 percent of its revenue,
unchanged from a year earlier. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs said yesterday that it reduced its
compensation and benefits expense to $12.2 billion in 2011 as
revenue slid 26 percent. The expense was enough to provide
$367,057 to each of its 33,300 employees, down from $430,700 for

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. left Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon''s pay package for 2011 almost
unchanged at about $23 million after trimming stock and options
awards, according to a person with knowledge of the decision. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the largest and most profitable U.S. bank, paid
Dimon $17.3 million in restricted stock and options for 2011,
down from $17.4 million for 2010, including 337,032 restricted
shares valued at about $12.3 million, according to regulatory
filings today by the New York-based company. The package awarded
562,430 options valued by the firm at about $5 million,
according to the person, who asked for anonymity because
compensation matters are confidential. </p>
<p>Dimon, 55, led JPMorgan through the financial crisis
without recording a single losing quarter and surpassed Bank of
America Corp. last year as the largest U.S. lender. Net income
advanced 9 percent to a record $19 billion in 2011, while the
stock dropped 20 percent including dividends. </p>
<p>Total compensation for the year is expected to be about the
same as 2010, the person said. Dimon may also receive a cash
bonus for 2011 that hasn''t yet been disclosed. </p>
<p>The exact total of his stock payout may differ and will be
disclosed when the company files its proxy statement later this
year. Dimon''s restricted stock may be worth as little as $12
million based on the average price of $35.61 on Jan. 18,
according to the person. </p>
<p>A $500,000 Raise </p>
<p>The board raised his annual base pay for 2011 in March to
$1.5 million from $1 million. Dimon also received options
proceeds on Jan. 19 of $195,869 and sold $4 million in shares on
Jan. 13 as part of a regularly scheduled sale to cover taxes on
restricted stock. </p>
<p>Dimon took the $1 million salary and gave up bonuses for
2008 -- the year when the financial crisis nearly toppled the
banking system -- after receiving $49.9 million in total
compensation for 2007, which included cash and restricted stock
bonuses of $14.5 million each. </p>
<p>Dimon was paid $15.2 million for his work in 2009,
according to the bank''s calculations. </p>

$5.1 million at today''s closing price of $18.39, according to a
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. He
won''t receive an immediate cash bonus, and the rest of his pay

company performance measures, said the person, who asked not to
be identified because Gorman''s total pay hasn''t been announced. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley is cutting pay for senior investment bankers

knowledge of the decision said this week. The New York-based
firm is capping immediate cash bonuses at $125,000 as it defers
a greater share of awards, a person briefed on the plan said. </p>
<p>Gorman''s pay for 2010 was $14 million, including 129,809
shares with a total value of $3.9 million at the time, and $3.5
million of stock options. He wasn''t awarded options for 2011. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s shares fell 44 percent in 2011, the
biggest annual decline since 2008. The firm rose 5.4 percent
yesterday after reporting a narrower fourth-quarter loss than
analysts estimated, and has gained 22 percent this year. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) will stick with a
smaller board for now following the death of Steve Jobs, its
largest stockholder, and two departures. </p>
<p>Disney, based in Burbank, California, proposed 10 current
directors for re-election at the company''s annual meeting set
for Tuesday, March 13, in Kansas City, Missouri, according to a
regulatory filing today. </p>
<p>The world''s biggest theme park operator is preparing for
the departure of Chairman John E. Pepper, 73, who plans to hand
over that role to Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger at the
meeting. Iger will hold both titles as part of the company''s
plan to appoint a new CEO in 2015. Iger, 60, received 2011
compensation of $33.4 million, up from $29.6 million a year
earlier, according to the filing. </p>
<p>Disney, also owner of the ABC broadcast network and the
ESPN cable channel, fell 0.3 percent to $39.31 in New York
trading. The shares were little changed last year. John Bryson
left the board in October to become U.S. Commerce Secretary. </p>
<p>The Steven P. Jobs trust owns 137.3 million Disney shares,
or almost 8 percent of the total, according the filing. The
shares are worth $5.4 billion. Previous filings listed him as
holding 138 million. </p>
<p>Iger''s 2011 pay included almost $2 million in salary, stock
awards of $8.1 million, option awards of $4.8 million and a
bonus of $15.5 million. A change in the value of his pension
contributed $2.07 million and other pay added almost $1 million
to the total. </p>
<p>In November, Disney raised its annual dividend by 50
percent to 60 cents a share, the biggest increase in at least 20
years, after the company reported record fiscal 2011 revenue and
profit. </p>
<p>In addition to Iger, those up for election are: Susan Arnold, John Chen, Judith Estrin, Fred Langhammer, Aylwin Lewis,
Monica Lozano, Robert Matschullat, Sheryl Sandberg and Orin Smith. </p>

<p>Donald R. Mullen Jr., who runs the
global credit and mortgage business at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS),
is leaving after 11 years at the firm, becoming the seventh
member of the management committee to depart in a year. </p>
<p>Mullen, 53, will become a senior director at the New York-
based firm, according to an internal memo obtained today by
Bloomberg News. Michael DuVally, a company spokesman, confirmed
the memo''s contents and said Mullen''s successor hasn''t been
announced yet. Senior directors advise the firm on matters
related to their areas of expertise and aren''t employees. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, said
this week that fourth-quarter profit fell 58 percent, capping
the firm''s worst earnings year since 2008. The company said its
credit and mortgage businesses struggled in the fourth quarter
even as revenue from commodities and foreign exchange improved.
The firm doesn''t provide revenue figures for those departments. </p>
<p>Credit and mortgages remained challenging as activity
levels declined across most products and a divergence between
cash and derivative pricing impacted hedging and inventory
management, David A. Viniar, Goldman Sachs''s chief financial
officer, told analysts on a Jan. 18 conference call. </p>
<p>The memo to employees was signed by Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd C. Blankfein, 57, and Chief Operating Officer Gary D. Cohn, 51. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s mortgage business, which outperformed
rivals in 2007, lost money in 2008. Goldman Sachs paid $550
million in 2010 to settle a lawsuit filed by the Securities and
Exchange Commission that accused the firm of misleading
investors on a mortgage-linked investment in 2007. </p>
<p>Other Departures </p>
<p>Mullen''s departure follows last week''s retirement by Edward K. Eisler, 42, and David B. Heller, 44, who were two of the four
co-heads of securities trading and also members of the
management committee. Other recent management committee
departures include Yusuf A. Alireza, who was co-president of the
Asia business; Edward C. Forst, who was co-head of the
investment management division; Kevin W. Kennedy, who supervised
the business in Latin America; and Richard M. Ruzika, who ran
the firm''s special-situations group before leaving at the end of
April. </p>
<p>Before joining Goldman Sachs as a partner in 2001, Mullen
was the head of credit and a board member at Goldman Sachs''s
smaller rival, Bear Stearns Cos. Prior to Bear Stearns, which
almost collapsed in March 2008 before being taken over by
JPMorgan Chase  Co., Mullen held senior positions in high-yield
sales for Salomon Brothers Inc., now part of Citigroup Inc. (C),
First Boston, now part of Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), and Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., which failed in 1990. </p>
<p>Mullen didn''t immediately reply to a message left with his
office at Goldman Sachs. DuVally said Mullen declined to
comment. </p>
<p>Mullen''s departure was reported earlier today by Reuters. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. hired Marc Granetz, Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)''s former chairman of investment
banking, to lead a new unit for global finance initiatives. </p>
<p>Granetz, 55, will report to Chief Financial Officer Doug Braunstein, according to a memo sent to employees of the New
York-based bank today. His group will work with executives and
businesses across JPMorgan on critical issues related to
finance and strategy, according to the memo. The memo''s
contents were confirmed by Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan
spokeswoman. </p>
<p>Marc will play an instrumental role in leading
initiatives that help drive sustained market leadership and
long-term profitability across the firm, such as our liquidity
project and expense management, Braunstein said in the memo. </p>
<p>JPMorgan last week said fourth-quarter net income slid to
$3.73 billion, or 90 cents a share, from $4.83 billion, or
$1.12, in the same period a year earlier as revenue from
investment banking fell. Full-year profit rose 9 percent from
2010 to a record $19 billion. The shares, which fell 22 percent
last year, rose 43 cents to $37.36 at 3:25 p.m. in New York
trading. </p>
<p>Credit Suisse said last month that Granetz would leave the
bank to pursue an opportunity outside investment banking.
Switzerland''s second-biggest lender by assets named Granetz to
chairman of investment banking at the end of 2009 after he
served five years as co-head of the department, which handles
merger advice and securities underwriting. </p>
<p>Granetz has overseen global mergers and acquisitions, run
media and telecommunications banking and managed a team that
advised oil and gas companies. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan
Stanley reported diverging value-at-risk in the fourth quarter
as volatility of some trading positions increased in the wake of
the euro-zone crisis. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley said so-called VaR was reduced to $123
million from $130 million in the previous quarter, the Bloomberg
Risk newsletter reported today. Goldman Sachs said its average
daily VaR increased to $135 million from $102 million amid
heightened volatility. The firms, which released quarterly
earnings this week, define VaR as their biggest anticipated one-
day trading loss 95 percent of the time. </p>
<p>Banks came under increasing pressure during last year''s
second half to manage risk linked to interest rates and Europe
amid the region''s sovereign debt crisis. In the first days of
this year, New York-based Morgan Stanley (MS) took another step,
completing an amendment to derivative contracts it had with the
Italian government as a counterparty. That reduced credit
exposure by $3.38 billion before hedges. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley cut its hedges against Italian default,
reporting $591 million of credit-default-swap protection, down
from $2.78 billion at the end of the third quarter. The bank
doesn''t recognize hedges on Italy purchased from Italian banks. </p>
<p>The Italian treasury uses derivatives, mostly interest-rate
swaps, to reduce the cost of interest payments on the country''s
$2 trillion bond liabilities. Morgan Stanley said its net
derivatives counterparty exposure to Italy was $4.2 billion
before the restructuring, which settled on Jan. 3. Morgan
Stanley didn''t disclose the notional amounts of its derivatives
with Italy. European governments don''t normally post collateral
on swap contracts with banks. </p>
<p>French Risk </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s disclosures also show that the bank has a
short position on French sovereign debt, which it uses to offset
a larger long exposure to French non-sovereign institutions. The
short position was $1.7 billion on Dec. 31, down from $2.3
billion at the end of the third quarter, contributing to a net
positive French exposure of $1.7 billion. The bank has a net
$411 million short position on Portuguese sovereign debt, the
filings show. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, said
on a conference call with analysts yesterday that the fourth-
quarter decline in VaR was due to reduced activity, especially
in credit products, and the closing out of derivative positions
with MBIA Inc. as part of its settlement with the bond insurer. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs said its exposure to European sovereigns and
companies before hedges was $3.9 billion, down by $300 million
from the previous quarter, without providing details. The New
York-based firm''s VaR increase was caused by significantly
greater volatility in the interest-rate category, Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar said on a Jan. 18 conference call
with analysts. </p>
<p>The bank includes sovereign and corporate debt within the
interest-rate category for VaR calculation purposes. </p>
<p>A divergence between cash and derivative pricing impacted
hedging and inventory management, Viniar said. Very unusual
divergence made it very, very hard to manage. </p>

Africa, according to a company memo obtained by Bloomberg News. </p>

<p>A decline in unemployment and pickup
in manufacturing point to accelerating U.S. growth. Some
economists say the numbers may not be as good as they look. </p>
<p>One reason: the severity of the economy''s plunge in late
2008 and early 2009 after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
collapsed threw a wrench into models used to smooth the data for
seasonal changes, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and Nomura Securities International Inc. </p>
<p>The jobless rate has dropped 0.4 percentage point over the
past two months, according to the Labor Department, and the
Institute for Supply Management''s factory index has climbed more
than three points since the end of August. Signs the world''s
largest economy was strengthening helped propel a 14 percent
gain in the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index in the past eight weeks. </p>
<p>The impact of the financial crisis does seem to have
affected seasonal factors for several indicators, Andrew Tilton, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs, said in a telephone
interview from New York. It might tend to make things look a
little better in the early winter and look a little worse in the
spring time. </p>
<p>Most economic data are adjusted for seasonal changes to
facilitate month-to-month comparisons. Without those changes,
for example, construction would always pick up in the summer,
when the weather is milder, and decline in the winter. </p>
<p>The adjustment process is unable to distinguish between a
one-time shock, like Lehman''s demise, and a recurring issue that
would need to be smoothed away. For that reason, the mechanism
gives some data a leg up from about September through about
March before turning negative the rest of the year. </p>
<p>The Recession </p>
<p>The economy contracted at an average 7.8 percent annual
pace from October 2008 through March 2009, the worst back-to-
back quarters in the post World War II era. The 18-month
recession ended in June 2009. </p>
<p>The adjustment process has been knocked out of whack by
the financial crisis, Ellen Zentner, a senior U.S. economist
at Nomura in New York, said in a telephone interview. The
model ends up adjusting for a growth pattern that isn''t there.
The sudden drop-off in economic activity in late 2008 is not a
pattern, it doesn''t happen late every year. It was a one-off
event. </p>
<p>Around April the seasonal bias turns and starts working
against the data, said Zentner, who shared her findings in
research notes issued in December and last week. </p>
<p>Beating Peers </p>
<p>Nomura was the fourth-best employment forecaster for the
two years through December, according to Bloomberg calculations.
Goldman Sachs was No. 1 among forecasters of gross domestic
product during the 12 months through June 2009. </p>
<p>Stocks were little changed today as investors weighed
developments in Europe''s efforts to take its debt crisis. The
Standard  Poor''s 500 Index closed at 1,316 in New York, up less
than 0.1 percent. </p>
<p>French business confidence unexpectedly fell in January to
the lowest in almost two years, providing the latest sign that
Europe''s second-largest economy is mired in a recession, figures
from the statistics office Insee showed today in Paris. </p>
<p>Elsewhere, prices paid by Australian producers decelerated
in the October through December period for a third straight
quarter, boosting scope for the central bank to lower borrowing
costs next month, data from the Bureau of Statistics showed in
Sydney. </p>
<p>Jobless Rate </p>
<p>The U.S. seasonal distortions are most acute for the
jobless rate, according to a report by Tilton issued Jan. 13.
The shift moves the rate by about a tenth of a point per month
on average relative to the adjustment before the crisis, he
said. The influence is most positive from November through
January, Tilton''s research showed. </p>
<p>The overcompensation probably accounts for about 0.2
percentage point of the 0.4-point drop in the jobless rate over
the past two months, according to Zentner''s calculations. </p>
<p>Economists at Goldman Sachs forecast unemployment will
average 8.5 percent this year, unchanged from December''s
reading. Nomura''s estimate is 8.4 percent. Zentner and Tilton
agree that data on GDP aren''t affected by the seasonal issues. </p>
<p>In addition to the unemployment rate, the other indicators
that show a marked influence include retail sales, consumer
prices excluding food and fuel costs and the total number of
people on jobless benefit rolls, Tilton said. </p>
<p>Chris Rupkey is among those who are more optimistic. </p>
<p>More Optimistic </p>
<p>Forecasters have moved too far to the other side of the
boat, they''ve gone too pessimistic, said Rupkey, chief
financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in New
York, who forecasts unemployment will average 8 percent this
year. The data is surprising to the upside and that leads us
to believe the entire year will surprise the market. </p>
<p>The ISM''s factory gauge has also been skewed by the
seasonal adjustment issues, according to Tilton''s and Zentner''s
research. Tilton estimates the deviation from the pre-crisis
adjustment averages about 0.35 point a month, and the most
positive influence occurs from September through December. </p>
<p>The manufacturing index was at 53.9 last month compared
with 50.6 in August, last year''s low point. </p>
<p>The bias stemming from the financial crisis has been
accompanied this year by warmer and drier weather than usual,
which has also boosted some data, said Tilton. </p>
<p>The housing-related data probably benefited from the fact
that the weather was relatively nice in December, said Tilton. </p>
<p>Construction Gain </p>
<p>Single-family housing starts rose in December to a 470,000
annual pace from 450,000 the prior month and the highest since
April 2010, the Commerce Department reported last week. </p>
<p>Homebuilders may not be the only industry benefitting. </p>
<p>Profits at Union Pacific Corp. (UNP), the biggest U.S. railroad,
topped estimates in the fourth quarter as carloads advanced 3
percent, led by gains in autos and chemicals. </p>
<p>Shipments of chemicals improved as favorable weather and
strong demand extended the shipping seasons, John Koraleski,
executive vice president of marketing and sales at Union
Pacific, said on a Jan. 19 conference call. </p>
<p>While the seasonal adjustment may have augmented the
improvement in growth, it does not cast doubt that growth has
strengthened, said Tilton. </p>
<p>The main driver is the fundamental state of the
economy, said Tilton. The drop in fuel prices in the second
half of the year and the rebound in confidence from the
uncertainty shock caused by the debt-ceiling debate have
played a bigger role in the improvement, he said. </p>

more than $556 million in residential mortgage-backed
securities. </p>
<p>Sealink, a fund created to manage Landesbank Sachsen AG''s
riskiest assets after the German lender almost collapsed, filed
the lawsuit in New York state Supreme Court in Manhattan on Jan.
20. </p>
<p>The securities were bought between 2006 and 2007 using
information provided by Morgan Stanley, which said it had
conducted due diligence on the lenders of the mortgages on which
the investments were based and assured Sealink that the loans
met underwriting standards and deserved the AAA ratings they
were assigned, lawyers for Sealink said in a statement. </p>
<p>In truth, and as Sealink and the world would only later
discover, the originators whose loans collateralized the Morgan
Stanley RMBS at issue were among the worst of the worst culprits
in the subprime lending industry, Sealink said in the lawsuit. </p>
<p>Lauren Onis, a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley, didn''t
immediately comment on the lawsuit in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>Sealink filed similar suits against JPMorgan Chase  Co.
and Bank of America''s Countrywide unit in September. Pools of
home loans securitized into bonds were a central part of the
housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the biggest
recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed, and the
crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the market for
the securities evaporated. </p>

<p>The lawsuit, filed today in New York state Supreme Court in
Manhattan, seeks unspecified damages for losses of market value
and principal and interest payments, as well as rescission and
recovery of payment for the investments. </p>
<p>John Hancock bought the securities in reliance on the
false and misleading statements made by the defendants, which
include Bear Stearns  Co. and Washington Mutual Inc. (WAMUQ), both of
which were acquired by JPMorgan, lawyers for the Boston-based
insurer said in the lawsuit. </p>
<p>Based on these material misrepresentations and omissions,
plaintiffs purchased securities that were far riskier than had
been represented, backed by mortgage loans worth significantly
less than had been represented, and that had been made to
borrowers who were much less creditworthy than had been

<p>Ex-Galleon Group LLC trader David
Slaine, who helped lead U.S. authorities to investigate the
hedge fund firm''s co-founder, Raj Rajaratnam, was sentenced to
three years of probation for securities fraud. </p>
<p>Slaine wore a wire to record dozens of conversations with
suspects including ex-Galleon trader Zvi Goffer who were later
charged with insider trading. He provided help that prosecutors
from the office of Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara called
nothing short of extraordinary. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan, who sentenced Slaine
Jan. 20 in Manhattan federal court, also ordered him to perform
300 hours of community service and pay a $500,000 fine. Sullivan
praised Slaine''s cooperation, which began in 2007. </p>
<p>Mr. Slaine, you have your life back, Sullivan said at
the end of the sentencing hearing. I think you''ve earned it,
by virtue of the work you''ve done over the last five years. </p>
<p>Slaine''s evidence helped spur what became the biggest probe
of insider trading at hedge funds, prosecutors said in a letter
to Sullivan this month. His lawyer, Stephen Kaufman, said Slaine
already has paid $836,000 in criminal forfeitures and to the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>
<p>Slaine is now an investor at Spot, a Manhattan-based chain
that provides training, grooming and daycare for dogs, according
to Kaufman. Slaine also works there, Kaufman said. </p>
<p>These last four years have been humbling and
humiliating, Slaine told Sullivan at his sentencing hearing.
I am ashamed of the bad decisions that I made back in 2002,
which haunt me to this day. </p>
<p>Slaine, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy and securities
fraud in December 2009, testified at the trial of Goffer, his
brother Emanuel Goffer and Michael Kimelman, that he cooperated
with federal agents for about 2 1/2 years to try to avoid
prison. He faced a sentence of as long as 25 years in prison. </p>

<p>Dexia Sues JPMorgan Over $1.7 Billion in Mortgage Securities </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest U.S. bank by assets, was
sued over mortgage-backed securities sold to Dexia SA (DEXB) because
the loans underlying the securities were allegedly riskier than
promised. </p>
<p>Dexia accused JPMorgan and companies it acquired -- Bear
Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual -- of egregious fraud,
saying they created and sold mortgage bonds backed by loans that
they knew to be exceptionally bad. </p>
<p>Dexia, the Brussels-based French-Belgian lender, said the
complaint, filed Jan. 19 in New York State Supreme Court,
involves about $1.7 billion of mortgage securities. Dexia
suffered substantial losses because mortgages were of poorer
quality and the risks of default and losses were much higher
than represented, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan, didn''t respond to an e-mail seeking comment. </p>
<p>The case is Dexia SA v. Bear Stearns  Co. Inc.,
650180-2012, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). </p>
<p>Corzine Sued for RICO Violation by MF Global Customers </p>
<p>Jon Corzine, MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ)''s former chief
executive officer, was sued under U.S. racketeering law by
commodity customers alleging he and other executives
unlawfully took money from their accounts and failed to
segregate their money as the law requires. </p>
<p>The suit alleges that hundreds of millions of dollars were
transferred from customers'' accounts to other MF Global units,
at a time when the company was short of cash and faced calls for
collateral as its risky Eurobond and other investments fell in
value. </p>
<p>Named in the suit, JPMorgan Chase  Co., the company''s
banker, should have noticed the depletion of customer money,
and should have investigated, according to the complaint. The
customers are seeking unspecified restitution and damages. </p>
<p>The suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan on Jan. 20 on
behalf of Robert Marcin and other MF Global segregated account
holders by Grant  Eisenhofer PA, is one of at least 10 against
Corzine and other MF Global executives. Plaintiffs including the
Virginia Retirement System have been competing to lead a
consolidated lawsuit seeking so-called class-action status. </p>
<p>Mary Sedarat, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to comment
on the suit. Andrew Levander, a lawyer for Corzine, didn''t
respond to an e-mail seeking comment. </p>
<p>The case is Marcin v. Corzine, 12-cv-0499, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Lawsuits/Pretrial </p>
<p>CFTC Position Limits Rule Lawsuit Dismissed by Appeals Court </p>
<p>Two Wall Street groups'' challenge to a U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission rule on position limits must first be
considered in a trial court, a federal appeals court ruled,
dismissing the case. </p>
<p>A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals in
Washington said Jan. 20 that it doesn''t have jurisdiction to
consider the case because the Commodity Exchange Act and last
year''s Dodd-Frank law are silent on whether the rule can be
directly challenged to the appeals court. </p>
<p>Initial review occurs at the appellate level only when a
direct-review statute specifically gives the court of appeals
subject-matter jurisdiction to directly review agency action,
Judges Judith Rogers, Merrick Garland and Janice Rogers Brown
said, citing circuit precedent. There is no express
congressional authorization of direct appellate review
applicable to the petition for review in this case. </p>
<p>The International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc.
and Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association filed
an emergency request Jan. 9 urging the appeals court to put the
rule on hold while the court considers their legal challenge.
The groups asked the court to issue a ruling by Jan. 27. </p>
<p>By dismissing the case, the judges also rejected that
request. </p>
<p>The groups, in one of the financial industry''s highest-
profile efforts to weaken last year''s Dodd-Frank law, filed
lawsuits challenging the rule in two federal courts in
Washington last month. The district court lawsuit had been put
on hold while the appeals court considered the case. </p>
<p>They argue that the CFTC used a flawed analysis of Dodd-
Frank when it decided to impose the restrictions. The
associations also said the CFTC failed to properly weigh the
rule''s costs and benefits. </p>
<p>Steven Adamske, a CFTC spokesman, declined to comment on
the ruling. </p>
<p>Ira Hammerman, general counsel for the Securities Industry
and Financial Markets Association, said the association will
move forward quickly in the district court. </p>
<p>The court''s ruling is entirely procedural, and was not a
decision about the merits of our challenge or of our request for
a stay, Hammerman said. </p>
<p>Steve Kennedy, a spokesman for the International Swaps and
Derivatives Association Inc., didn''t immediately respond to a
phone message seeking comment after business hours. </p>
<p>The two associations represent JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS), among other banks
and asset managers. </p>
<p>The case is International Swaps and Derivatives Association
v. CFTC, 11-01491, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia (Washington). </p>
<p>U.S. Defends Use of Wiretap Evidence in Rajat Gupta Prosecution </p>
<p>U.S. prosecutors opposed a bid by former Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. director Rajat Gupta to block use in his criminal
case of wiretap evidence obtained from the mobile phone of
convicted inside trader Raj Rajaratnam. </p>
<p>Six different judges authorized the wiretaps because they
are particularly appropriate in investigating insider trading,
which requires communication and is often difficult to detect
and prove beyond a reasonable doubt, the government said Jan. 19
in a filing opposing Gupta''s request to suppress the evidence. </p>
<p>In an effort to suppress incriminating wiretap evidence
against him, Gupta has mimicked Rajaratnam''s arguments in
Rajaratnam''s failed attempt to suppress the wiretap evidence,
prosecutors said in the filing in federal court in Manhattan. </p>
<p>Gupta, who also sat on the board of Procter  Gamble Co.
and led McKinsey  Co., was indicted by a federal grand jury in
October on five counts of securities fraud and one count of
conspiracy to commit securities fraud for passing inside
information to Rajaratnam. Gupta also faces a lawsuit filed by
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>
<p>Rajaratnam, the former Galleon Group LLC hedge fund
manager, was convicted last year of directing the biggest
insider-trading ring in a generation. It was one of the first
insider-trading cases in which the government made extensive use
of wiretaps. </p>
<p>Gary Naftalis, a lawyer for Gupta, didn''t return a call
seeking comment on the government''s filing. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Gupta, 11-cr-00907, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<p>Apple, Microsoft Patent Lawyers Spend Fridays in Mannheim </p>
<p>If you were searching for Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s European patent
lawyers on a Friday, you would have better luck looking in the
German city of Mannheim than on the golf course or in a pub,
Bloomberg News'' Karin Matussek reports. </p>
<p>Judges in the southwest German city hold most patent
hearings on the last day of the week and will issue rulings in
smartphone disputes involving Apple, Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) and
Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. over four of the five Fridays
that began Jan. 20. The city, along with Dusseldorf and Munich,
has become the center of European patent litigation as companies
seek quick rulings from German judges that influence courts
throughout the continent. </p>
<p>If you have a big multinational corporation setting up a
patent litigation strategy for Europe, they will almost always
sue in Germany, said Rowan Freeland, a litigator at Simmons 
Simmons LLP in London. Maybe you add other countries as well,
but if you have to choose, it''s almost certainly Germany. </p>
<p>Mobile device makers filed dozens of cases in the three
cities last year. Samsung lost Jan. 20 a patent-infringement
suit filed against Apple in the Mannheim court. The judges also
heard another suit between the two rivals. </p>
<p>Samsung said it was disappointed by the Jan. 20 ruling and
added that the decision isn''t indicative for other pending
cases. </p>
<p>Germany''s role in the European economy is just as important
as the speed of the rulings, issued by specialist judges, said
Peter-Michael Weisse, an attorney at intellectual-property
litigation firm Wildanger in Dusseldorf. </p>
<p>If you want to conquer the European market and you''re
being stopped in Germany, most of the time that''s enough to
throw in the towel, Weisse said. Many companies say if they
cannot sell in Germany, it''s no use to go ahead with a product
somewhere else. </p>
<p>London and The Hague, Netherlands, compete with Germany as
venues for European patent litigation. The Netherlands''
disadvantage is a smaller economy, while the U.K. is hindered by
high legal costs, Freeland said. While there is no pan-European
patent, courts often look for similar rulings in other
countries. </p>

<p>U.K. Tabloid Publisher Loses Ruling Over Secret Evidence </p>
<p>The publisher of the Daily Mail tabloid in Britain lost a
lawsuit to ban the use of anonymous evidence by journalists at a
judge-led inquiry into media ethics, set up after News Corp.''s
phone-hacking scandal. </p>
<p>The ruling Jan. 20 in London allows unnamed reporters and
editors to allege illegal practices at newspapers other than
News Corp.''s now-shuttered News of the World tabloid. Associated
Newspapers Ltd. (DMGT), a unit of Daily Mail and General Trust Plc,
sued the inquiry over claims that anonymous statements would be
unfair and risk hurting other tabloids'' reputations. </p>
<p>Associated Newspapers also publishes the Mail on Sunday and
Metro in the U.K. The Daily Mail''s editor, Paul Dacre, has been
a critic of the inquiry, saying in October that phone hacking at
the News of the World exposed police failures in past
investigations rather than a need for more industry regulation. </p>
<p>The public interest in the inquiry''s chairman being able
to pursue his terms of reference as widely and deeply as he
considers necessary is of the utmost importance, Judge Roger
Toulson said in the judgment. </p>
<p>Lawyers for victims of phone hacking say journalists who
wish to expose wrongdoing at their newspapers should be free to
do so without fear of a backlash. The names of the newspapers
will also be left out of the statements. </p>
<p>The inquiry, led by Judge Brian Leveson, was announced in
July by U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron after revelations that
the News of the World hacked into the voice mail of a murdered
school girl in 2002, when she was missing. The probe extends
beyond News Corp. (NWSA)''s five-year-old scandal, covering the ethics
of the press and its relationship with politicians and police. </p>

<p>Trials/Appeals </p>
<p>Stanford Investors Endure Living Hell'' on Eve of Trial </p>
<p>R. Allen Stanford''s investors, after waiting three years to
see the Texas financier go to trial on charges of leading a $7
billion fraud, must hold on even longer before learning when
they will get some of their money back, Bloomberg News'' Andrew
Harris and Laurel Brubaker Calkins report. </p>
<p>Stanford''s customers have received nothing since the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission closed his businesses in
February 2009. </p>
<p>Stanford, accused of misleading people who bought
certificates of deposit from his Antigua-based bank, spent their
money on bad investments, sports sponsorships and a lavish
lifestyle that included yachts, a fleet of jets, mansions and a
private Caribbean island, U.S. prosecutors said. Jury selection
in his criminal trial is scheduled to start Jan. 23 in federal
court in Houston. Stanford, who denies any wrongdoing, faces as
long as 20 years in prison if convicted. </p>
<p>It''s not fair that we have to be put through this living
hell, said Blaine Smith of Louisiana, who claims to have lost
$1 million in life savings invested with Stanford. </p>
<p>A court-appointed receiver for Stanford Group Co. has spent
at least $103 million on litigation, wind-down costs and other
expenses, while collecting less than $212 million in cash and
material assets since the SEC sued Stanford in February 2009. </p>
<p>The expenditures include professional fees and expenses of
$52.1 million through October, with $1.3 million of this going
to receiver Ralph Janvey''s firm, Dallas-based Krage  Janvey
LLP, according to a Bloomberg review of court records. That sum
covers the $21.3 million Janvey asked court permission to pay
his primary outside law firm, Houston-based Baker Botts LLP, for
work done from Feb. 17, 2009, to Sept. 30, 2011. </p>
<p>Unlike Stanford, repayment processes have moved forward for
claimants in the Bernard L. Madoff fraud case and the bankruptcy
of MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ), the parent of commodities broker MF
Global Inc. </p>
<p>An attorney for Janvey said that it''s too soon to say when
investors may see some of the money. </p>
<p>The SEC case is Securities and Exchange Commission v.
Stanford International Bank Ltd., 09-cv-00298, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of Texas (Dallas). The criminal case is
U.S. v. Stanford, 09-cr-00342, U.S. District Court, Southern

<p>U.K. Judge Tells Merrill, UBS to Seek Lombardy Swaps Settlement </p>
<p>Bank of America Corp.''s Merrill Lynch unit and UBS AG (UBSN) must
try to reach an out-of-court resolution to their dispute with
the Italian Region of Lombardy over interest-rate transactions,
a London judge ruled. </p>
<p>Judge Nigel Teare granted an order for alternative dispute
resolution at a hearing Jan. 20. </p>
<p>Merrill and UBS sued Lombardy in the U.K. in 2010 to uphold
derivatives contracts sold to the region. Lombardy, the northern
Italian region where Milan is located, accused the banks of
fraud and hidden fees, according to court papers. </p>
<p>Italian local governments including Tuscany, Lazio,
Piedmont and Florence have challenged investment banks in the
courts over derivatives contracts which turned out to cost more
than expected. </p>
<p>UBS lawyer Sonia Tolaney said at the Jan. 20 hearing the
Zurich-based bank had restarted informal negotiations with
Lombardy in December. Richard Handyside, an attorney for New
York-based Merrill, said the bank wasn''t currently in talks with
the region. </p>
<p>The Merrill case is Merrill Lynch International Bank Ltd.

<p>Ex-UBS Client Heller Gets 45-Day Jail Term for Tax Evasion </p>
<p>Kenneth Heller, a disbarred New York maritime lawyer, was
sentenced to 45 days in jail for using an offshore UBS AG
account to hide income from U.S. tax authorities. </p>
<p>Heller, 82, who pleaded guilty in June to three counts of
tax evasion for the years 2006, 2007 and 2008, was sentenced
Jan. 20 by U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel in Manhattan. The
parties agreed that the amount of taxes Heller avoided was
between $400,000 and $1 million. He also paid a $9.8 million
penalty to the Internal Revenue Service. </p>
<p>Heller, who faced as long as 15 years in prison, has
cancer, memory loss and other physical and mental problems,
according to a defense filing in which his lawyers asked that he
not be imprisoned. </p>
<p>Heller is an elderly man at the end of his life who is in
almost constant pain and is faced with ever-mounting physical
disability, defense lawyers said. </p>
<p>Citing Heller''s health, prosecutors recommended a sentence
shorter than the 30 to 37 months that both sides agreed would be
called for under federal sentencing guidelines, which are
nonbinding. </p>
<p>Heller was one of seven ex-clients of Zurich-based UBS
arrested on the same day in 2010 and charged with hiding more
than $100 million from the IRS. </p>
<p>UBS admitted in February 2009 that it helped U.S. clients
evade taxes. The bank avoided prosecution by paying a $780
million fine and turning over the names of U.S. account holders
to investigators. </p>

<p>Boeing to Pay U.S. $4.4 Million to End Chinook Billing Case </p>
<p>Boeing Co. (BA), the second-largest defense contractor, agreed
to pay the U.S. $4.4 million to resolve allegations that it
overbilled the government for work on Chinook military
helicopters. </p>
<p>The settlement requires Boeing to retrain its employees and
make improvements to software it uses to track its billing,
Philadelphia U.S. Attorney Zane Memeger said Jan. 20 in a
statement. A whistle-blower lawsuit alerted the government to
the issue, according to the statement. </p>
<p>Some of the most important cases begin with a citizen who
sees something wrong and speaks up, Memeger said in the
statement. Whistle-blowers who notify the government of
possible fraud allow us both to correct that specific problem
and to prevent similar misconduct from recurring in the
future. </p>
<p>The U.S. Justice Department awarded Boeing a contract in
2003 to produce and modify new Chinook helicopters as part of
the Army''s effort to modernize its fleet. More than 100 Chinooks
were ordered. </p>
<p>A government probe revealed that Boeing managers instructed
mechanics to perform non-billable work while separately billing
the U.S. for their time, resulting in the government being
charged for work for which it had already paid, according to the
statement. </p>
<p>Damien Mills, a spokesman at Boeing''s Chinook plant in
Ridley Park, Pennsylvania, said the company cooperated fully
with the government''s investigation. </p>
<p>As the investigation revealed, this is a matter of
inadequate charging discipline in the past, not of any
deliberate wrongdoing, Mills said in an e-mailed statement. </p>

<p>Lehman Pays More Than $500 Million to Marsal Firm in 39Months </p>
<p>Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) has paid more than $500
million in fees to restructuring firm Alvarez  Marsal LLC in 39
1/2 months, according to a court filing. </p>
<p>The firm, whose co-founder Bryan Marsal runs the defunct
investment bank, charged $504.2 million through December for
interim management, including $8 million last month,
according to the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. </p>
<p>Lehman, which has spent almost $1.6 billion on fees since
filing the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history in September 2008,
paid $54.1 million to lawyers and managers in December,
according to the filing. </p>
<p>Lehman''s bankruptcy became America''s most costly in April
2010, when it surpassed the $757 million cost of Enron Corp. (ENRNQ)''s
three-year liquidation, according to data assembled by
bankruptcy professor Lynn LoPucki at the University of
California, Los Angeles. The failed energy trader''s investors
were paid 53 cents on the dollar, while Lehman''s $65 billion
liquidation plan would give the average creditor less than 18
cents, according to court documents. </p>
<p>New York-based Weil, Gotshal  Manges LLP, Lehman''s lead
bankruptcy law firm, has earned $375.1 million, including $8.5
million in December. </p>
<p>Marsal, who bills Lehman hourly, has said he will start
distributing some cash to the defunct investment bank''s
creditors by next year, more than three years after the
bankruptcy filing. He has court approval for the $65 billion
liquidation plan that intends to raise about $40 billion in the
next few years, excluding cash on hand, according to court
papers. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest
and most profitable U.S. bank, cut the stock awarded to Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon''s operating committee 15 percent
as the value of the firm''s shares fell. </p>
<p>Dimon''s top 13 executives collected $60.9 million in
restricted shares plus stock options for their performance in
2011, according to regulatory filings. That compares with $71.4
million of stock granted to 14 people who served on the
committee in 2010. </p>
<p>The restricted stock averaged $4.7 million per executive as
of the Jan. 18 award date, compared with $5.1 million a year
earlier when New York-based JPMorgan''s shares were higher. </p>
<p>The reductions show JPMorgan''s top managers aren''t immune
from pay cuts being felt across Wall Street, said Frank Glassner, chief executive officer of Veritas Executive
Compensation Consultants in San Francisco. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley is cutting pay for senior investment bankers
and traders an average of 20 percent to 30 percent, people with
knowledge of the decision said last week. Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. reduced its compensation and benefits expense 21 percent to
$12.2 billion in 2011 as revenue slid 26 percent. </p>
<p>JPMorgan fell 22 percent in 2011, outperforming the 25
percent decline in the KBW Bank Index. Goldman Sachs and Morgan
Stanley, both based in New York, dropped more than 40 percent. </p>
<p>Dimon, whose 2011 pay held steady at about $23 million,
shrank the size of his operating committee by one as Jay Mandelbaum and Heidi Miller stepped down to pursue other
interests. Charlie Scharf, the former retail division CEO, was
removed in June when his duties were reassigned and he was
transferred to the private-equity unit. </p>
<p>Petno, Hogan </p>
<p>Doug Petno, who now runs commercial banking, and John Hogan, Dimon''s new chief risk officer, joined the committee when
they were promoted. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s board increased restricted shares awarded to the
committee to 1.71 million from 1.63 million in 2010 and boosted
options to 2.05 million from 1.62 million, filings show. </p>
<p>Restricted shares encourage executives to stay at a firm
while minimizing the chances of their compensation being wiped
out, Glassner said. Options, which let executives buy shares at
pre-set prices, are riskier because they can lose all value if
the stock falls. </p>
<p>The following table shows stock awards for Dimon''s current
operating committee and the value of their restricted stock

<p>General Electric Co. (GE) lost a U.S.
challenge of its 2009 victory in a battle with the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service over tax benefits from a partnership structure
with Dutch banks. </p>
<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals in New York today reversed an
October 2009 ruling by a federal judge in Connecticut that
concluded GE''s arrangement with a group of Dutch banks in the
1990s was legitimate. In its ruling today, the court said that
the IRS properly imposed a monetary penalty against a General
Electric subsidiary for substantially understating its income
taxes for 1997 and 1998. </p>
<p>GE, the world''s largest lessor of aircraft, set up the
Castle Harbour partnership in 1993 with Dutch banks including
ING Bank NV and Rabo Merchant Bank NV. Under the terms of the
transaction, the GE subsidiary received most of the actual
leasing income. For tax purposes, 98 percent of the taxable
income was allocated to the banks and was not subject to U.S.
income taxes. </p>
<p>The Court of Appeals holds that the evidence compels the
conclusion that the banks do not qualify, the three-judge
appeals panel said in today''s ruling. The government is
entitled to impose a penalty on the taxpayer for substantial
understatement of income. </p>
<p>Airplanes </p>
<p>The arrangement shifted about $310 million in income from
leases on old airplanes to the banks and saved GE about $62
million over a five-year period. </p>
<p>The IRS subsequently determined that the arrangement was a
sham, and Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE paid the
government the $62 million, according to a 2009 ruling. The
partnership then sued to challenge the IRS claim that the
partnership structure had no business purpose other than
reducing tax expenses. </p>
<p>The federal appeals court has twice rejected the lower
court''s view of the case. In 2006, the panel reversed U.S.
District Judge Stefan R. Underhill''s 2004 ruling that concluded
the banks were valid partners and sent the case back to him for
reconsideration. </p>
<p>Underhill also found in favor of GE in 2009, ruling that
the IRS couldn''t impose a penalty upon the subsidiary. The IRS
appealed. </p>
<p>Complex Disguises'' </p>
<p>In today''s ruling, the federal appeals court panel said the
Dutch banks weren''t valid partners in Castle Harbour under the
tax code. The federal appeals court also said the IRS could
impose penalties against the GE subsidiary, known as TIFD III-E. </p>
<p>This decision shows that our courts will not allow large
corporations to use complex disguises to get improper tax
breaks, John DiCicco, acting assistant attorney general for
the Justice Department''s Tax Division, said in a statement. In
fact, companies that avoid paying their fair share of the tax
burden by engaging in these types of games are setting
themselves up for substantial penalties in addition to the taxes
they should have paid in the first place. </p>
<p>We are disappointed that the Court of Appeals overturned
the trial court''s most recent favorable decision, GE said in
an e-mailed statement. This new ruling has no impact on GE''s
current operations, nor will it have any adverse financial
impact. We continue to analyze the court''s opinion and our
options. </p>
<p>The case is TIFD II-D Inc. v. United States of America, 10-
70, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (New York). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Citigroup Inc. sold $1 billion of commercial-mortgage bonds in
the year''s first offering, according to people familiar with the
deal. </p>
<p>The top-ranked portion maturing in about 10 years yields
120 basis points more than the benchmark swap rate, said the
people, who declined to be identified because terms aren''t
public. Securities rated BBB-, the lowest investment-grade
ranking, yield 790 basis points more than the benchmark, the
people said. </p>
<p>The deal is the first since banks pulled back from making
new loans to package into bonds in July as Europe''s debt crisis
roiled credit markets and sent spreads soaring. Originations
have since picked up, according to a Standard  Poor''s report
last month. The ratings company is forecasting $35 billion in
2012 sales. </p>
<p>The extra yield investors demand to hold top-ranked
commercial-mortgage bonds rather than Treasuries has declined to
2.3 percentage points as of yesterday from 2.61 percentage
points at the end of December, according to the Barclays Capital
CMBS AAA Super Duper Index. </p>
<p>Relative yields on commercial mortgage bonds determine how
attractive Wall Street rates are for property owners and drive
the velocity of new offerings. Sales of the debt reached a
record $234 billion in 2007, Bloomberg data show. Issuance
tumbled to $12.2 billion in 2008 as credit markets seized. The
market stayed shut until November 2009. Banks arranged $28
billion in 2011, compared with $11.5 billion in 2010, Bloomberg
data show. </p>
<p>The spread on top-ranked commercial-mortgage bonds was as
narrow as 60 basis points more than Treasuries when sales peaked
in 2007, and as wide as 14.92 percentage points in November 200
in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE)''s strategy to keep its
market share of cholesterol pill Lipitor may boost revenue
without aiding profit, said the chief executive officer of
Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI), the drugmaker''s partner on the
medicine''s generic version. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s plan to hold off generic competition may be
failing, said Paul Bisaro, Watson''s CEO. Pfizer, the world''s
largest drugmaker, gave Parsippany, New Jersey-based Watson the
right to sell an authorized copy of Lipitor for a share of
the revenue generated by the generic drug. </p>
<p>They''re starting to lose market share, Bisaro said
today at a company meeting with analysts. It appeared they
were trying to protect revenue and not profit, he said. </p>
<p>Lipitor (PHAM1150), with $10.7 billion in sales in 2010, began facing
generic versions made by Watson and Punjab, India-based Ranbaxy
Laboratories Ltd. (RBXY) last month in the U.S. after the medicine''s
patent protection expired. New York-based Pfizer reached
agreements with insurers such as UnitedHealth Group Inc. and
Coventry Health Care Inc. to block sales of the copycat pills in
return for rebates or price cuts on Lipitor. </p>
<p>We couldn''t ever make it work that the discounts they
were doing to get market share were better than what they''d get
if they just allowed their authorized partner sell the
product, Bisaro said. People have to decide, on a brand
perspective, whether it was actually worth it. </p>
<p>Market Numbers </p>
<p>Pfizer''s market share has dropped to 32 percent in the
seventh week of competition from 41 percent in the second week,
according to data from IMS Health analyzed by Jami Rubin, an
analyst with Goldman Sachs in New York. PFE''s share may be
starting to slip, Rubin said in a note. </p>
<p>Watson fell 2.3 percent to $55.89 at 4 p.m. New York time.
Pfizer declined less than 1 percent to $21.66. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s strategy is designed to increase patient choice
and improve patient adherence by offering Lipitor patients more
support than they would receive from a company selling generic
atorvastatin, said Mackay Jimeson, a spokesman for Pfizer, in
an e-mail. </p>
<p>Watson plans to spend on acquisitions to diversify into
brand-name drugs, rather than share buybacks or a dividend,
Bisaro said today. </p>
<p>Over time our investor base will appreciate the assets we
have in our portfolio, Bisaro said. </p>
<p>On Jan. 20, Watson failed to win the support of a panel
advising the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on the company''s
pre-term birth gel. The FDA is scheduled to decide whether to
approve the drug by Feb. 26. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s prospects
have improved as the risk of a European bank meltdown eases and
the firm adapts to structural changes in the market, JMP
Securities analyst David Trone said. </p>
<p>After a meeting yesterday with Goldman Sachs Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar, Trone said he was more
optimistic about near-term prospects than we have been in
sometime. He said today in a note to clients that he sees
some upward bias to his earnings estimates for New York-
based Goldman Sachs, which last week posted a smaller decline in
fourth-quarter profit than analysts predicted. </p>
<p>Earnings reports from the six largest U.S. banks showed the
industry suffered a third straight quarterly drop in combined
trading and investment-banking revenue, raising concern that the
slowdown is more than just a temporary rut and may signal a
lasting shift to smaller volumes, profits and pay. </p>
<p>Executives and analysts are focusing on whether stiffer
regulations, capital rules and a weak economy may solidify a
decline in revenue after the European debt crisis curbed trading
volume and corporate dealmaking in last year''s second half.
Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), UBS AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc, which are all shrinking their investment banks, have
announced plans to eliminate about 8,300 jobs since the start of
November. </p>
<p>Trone said Goldman Sachs''s adaptability makes him
bullish about the company''s long-term prospects and supports
his view that the franchise has a competitive and profitable
future. Goldman Sachs said revenue will rise when the markets
rebound, boosting pay for investment bankers, according to
Trone. </p>

<p>Walter Energy Inc. (WLT) may finally lure
buyers willing to bet on a recovery in coal prices with the
industry''s cheapest stock. </p>
<p>After losing almost half its value in the past year, the
producer of steelmaking coal sold for 9.3 times earnings this
week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That was less
than any North American coal-mining company with $1 billion in
market capitalization. The slide also drove down the value of
Walter Energy to 1.7 times its net assets this month, the lowest
since the last bear market in U.S. equities, the data show. </p>
<p>While a surge in coal prices last year led to the biggest
wave of coal deals, most acquirers were left with losses as
demand for the commodity collapsed. Walter Energy, which bought
Western Coal Corp. for $5.3 billion in April, is an attractive
target because it produces high-grade steelmaking coal, Brean
Murray Carret  Co. said. A buyer could spend double Walter
Energy''s closing price of $67.54 a share yesterday and still get
the company for less relative to earnings than any coal takeover
in the past year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Now is the opportune time for a buyer to potentially
start looking at them, J. Christopher Haberlin, a Richmond,
Virginia-based analyst at Davenport  Co., said in a telephone
interview. It''s some of the best coal in the world and it''s
what steelmakers want. If somebody did make a run at Walter
here, certainly they could take Walter out a price much lower
than where that valuation may have been. </p>
<p>Walter Energy may attract interest from BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP),
Anglo American Plc (AAL) or ArcelorMittal, and could command as much
as $120 a share in an acquisition, he said. </p>
<h2>Today''s Trading </h2>
<p>Paul Blalock, a spokesman for Birmingham, Alabama-based
Walter Energy, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Kelly Quirke, a spokeswoman at BHP, declined to comment on
whether the Melbourne-based company is considering a bid for
Walter Energy, as did James Wyatt-Tilby, a spokesman for Anglo
American of London. Giles Read of Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal
didn''t immediately respond to a telephone call or an e-mail
seeking comment outside normal business hours. </p>
<p>Walter Energy advanced as much as 5.4 percent today before
closing 3.9 percent higher at $70.14 in New York. The shares
fell 45 percent in the past year through yesterday, the biggest
drop in the 34-stock Bloomberg World Coal Index (BWCOAL) apart from two
companies -- Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR) and Arch Coal Inc. (ACI),
the data show. </p>
<h2>Earnings Miss </h2>
<p>Most of the decline came after Walter Energy completed its
biggest ever acquisition with its purchase of Western Coal, as
Keith Calder quit as chief executive officer in June after three
months on the job and the company''s earnings fell short of
analysts'' projections. </p>
<p>Walter Energy plummeted 30 percent on Aug. 4, its biggest
drop since at least March 1995, after second-quarter revenue and
net income trailed estimates. </p>
<p>The company''s fourth-quarter profit forecast in November
also missed analysts'' projections after it suffered a more than
40 percent decline in third-quarter earnings. This month, Walter
Energy cut its coal production forecast for 2012. </p>
<p>The share-price slump, which erased $2.3 billion in Walter
Energy''s market capitalization in the past year and left it with
a value of $4.2 billion yesterday, pushed down its valuation and
increased speculation it could be vulnerable to a takeover. </p>
<h2>Relative Value </h2>
<p>At 9.3 times earnings, Walter Energy was valued at a 33
percent discount to the industry average for North American coal
mining companies, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Walter Energy
also traded at 1.7 times its assets minus liabilities earlier
this month, about half its valuation in August. </p>
<p>While Walter Energy''s stock has fallen, its coal is
considered better quality because it''s purer and has a so-called
higher heat rate, making it desirable for steelmakers that use
it to forge the alloy, according to T. Rowe Price Group Inc. </p>
<p>Walter Energy, which has operations in Alabama''s Blue Creek
seam and added mines in Canada when it bought Vancouver-based
Western Coal, sold its coal for a price of $223 per ton in the
third quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>That''s more than any U.S. coal producer and three times the
average price for the industry, the data show. </p>
<p>With prices for steelmaking coal close to bottoming,
according to an estimate from Raymond James Financial Inc.,
Walter Energy makes sense as an acquisition target, said Lucas Pipes, a New York-based analyst at Brean Murray. </p>
<h2>No Question'' </h2>
<p>There''s no question that folks always have MA in the
back of their minds with Walter, he said in a telephone
interview. They do have high quality met coal reserves and at
least over the last couple of years have enjoyed pretty healthy
prices. Walter''s reserves definitely hit the parameters in terms
of what potential buyers are looking for. </p>
<p>BHP Billiton, the world''s biggest mining company, and Anglo
American, which mines for coal, iron ore and diamonds, could
gain Walter Energy''s mines in Alabama and western Canada, which
are near ports and can help any buyer cut the cost to ship coal
to South America, Europe and Asia, Davenport''s Haberlin said. </p>
<p>Buying Walter Energy would also help ArcelorMittal (MT), the
world''s largest steelmaker, reduce the amount of coal it needs
to purchase from suppliers, according to Malcolm Polley, who
oversees $1.1 billion as chief investment officer at Stewart
Capital in Indiana, Pennsylvania. </p>
<p>It would help ArcelorMittal in terms of becoming a more
vertically integrated producer of steel, he said. You want
to do it in the case of ArcelorMittal because you want to lock
in a reasonable cost for your met coal. </p>
<h2>Would Emerge'' </h2>
<p>While Davenport''s Haberlin estimates that Walter Energy
could command a takeover premium of more than 75 percent,
doubling yesterday''s price to $135 a share would value the
company at 14 times its earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>That would still be cheaper than any billion-dollar coal
acquisition last year, when a record $28 billion in company
takeovers were announced in the industry, the data show. </p>
<p>Walter Energy is an attractive acquisition, said
Davenport''s Haberlin. They do have very good quality coal. It
would be a major global miner or a global steel company that
would emerge as the bidder. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended
its clients buy the Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar versus
the U.S. currency, saying the Federal Reserve''s pledge to keep
interest rates low reaffirms a dollar weakening trend. </p>
<p>The peso may advance to 12 per dollar from 13.019 today and
the Canadian currency will rise to 95 cents per U.S. dollar from
C$1.0043, analysts led by Thomas Stolper wrote in a note. </p>
<p>We have argued repeatedly that the broad dollar weakness
theme remains intact as a result of the still very weak U.S.
balance of payments and a very dovish Fed, the analysts wrote
today. The Fed''s pledge today to keep its benchmark borrowing
costs between zero and 0.25 percent until at least late 2014
reaffirms our view that the dollar weakening trend is not
over, they wrote. </p>
<p>The Mexican peso remains cheap while the country''s
balance of payments is solid, the analysts wrote. In Canada,
policy makers may not follow the Fed in pursuing a more
proactive monetary policy, the analysts said. </p>

<p>General Dynamics Corp. (GD), citing
weakening defense sales, forecast 2012 earnings below analysts''
estimates. </p>
<p>The maker of Abrams battle tanks and Gulfstream business
aircraft estimates its full-year net income from continuing
operations at $7.10 to $7.20 a share, Jay Johnson, the chairman
and chief executive officer, said today. The average estimate of
25 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was $7.62 a share. </p>
<p>General Dynamics'' defense sales may fall 1 percent to 2
percent this year amid uncertainty about the U.S. defense
budget, Johnson said on a conference call with analysts. He
cited presidential and congressional elections and the looming
shadow of automatic budget cuts, known as sequestration, that
might lead to Pentagon spending cuts of as much as $1 billion
over a decade. </p>
<p>If sequestration were to occur as laid out today. it
would be very bad for defense and frankly for our country,
Johnson said today. He said the decline in defense sales may be
offset by sales in the company''s aerospace unit, the maker of
Gulfstream business jets. </p>
<p>General Dynamics rose 23 cents to $71.57 at the close in
New York. </p>
<p>Fourth-quarter profit declined 17.3 percent because
performance fell short of expectations at a unit that outfits
and overhauls business jets, the Falls Church, Virginia-based
company said earlier today. </p>
<p>Net Income Fell </p>
<p>Net income fell to $603 million, or $1.68 a share, from
$729 million, or $1.91 a share, a year earlier, General Dynamics
said in a statement. It missed the profit estimate of $1.99 a
share, the average of 23 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales
rose 6.3 percent to $9.15 billion. </p>
<p>The company said the quarter''s earnings were reduced by
charges of $189 million at the company''s Switzerland-based Jet
Aviation unit, which maintains and refurbishes business jets
other than the company''s own Gulfstream aircraft. The company
took a writedown reflecting a loss of contracts and an outlook
with substantially fewer business jets than projected when it
acquired Jet Aviation in 2008, Johnson said. </p>
<p>The company''s defense business, which provided about 82
percent of its revenue last year, may be at risk because it is
more dependent on U.S. Army programs than its peers as defense
spending declines, Douglas Harned, an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein LLC in New York, wrote in a Jan. 20 note to clients.
Harned rates the stock market-perform. </p>
<p>Pentagon Cuts </p>
<p>The Pentagon must cut about $490 billion from its planned
spending over the next 10 years under budget-reduction
legislation, with an additional $500 billion if the automatic
cuts go through. </p>
<p>To counter the Pentagon''s budget reductions, Johnson has
said he has stepped up acquisitions to expand the company''s
reach beyond defense and aerospace. </p>
<p>In September, the Falls Church, Virginia-based company
spent $960 million to acquire Vangent Inc., a provider of
health-care information technology services. In December,
General Dynamics bought Force Protection Inc. (FRPT), a maker of mine-
clearing vehicles and armored trucks, in a deal valued at $360
million. </p>
<p>General Dynamics sees opportunities for more acquisitions
of defense companies at good value, Johnson said today on
the conference call. </p>
<p>Gulfstream Jets </p>
<p>Sales at the Aerospace unit, which makes Gulfstream jets
and also includes Jet Aviation, rose 47 percent to $1.86 billion
in the fourth quarter, while income fell 65 percent to $73
million. </p>
<p>Gulfstream deliveries of so-called green, or unfinished,
airplanes rose 75 percent, to 35 units, during the quarter
compared with the same period last year, the company said. </p>
<p>Johnson said he expected Gulfstream''s G650 and G280
business jets to win Federal Aviation Administration
certification and go into service by midyear. </p>
<p>Revenue at the Marine Systems unit, which builds nuclear-
powered submarines and U.S. Navy destroyers, rose 3.4 percent to
$1.76 billion. Profit rose 7.3 percent to $190 million. The unit
received a $280 million order from the U.S. Navy to convert
nuclear submarines for use in training. </p>
<p>Revenue at the Combat Systems unit, which manufactures
Abrams tanks and Stryker vehicles, fell 3.2 percent to $2.6
billion, and profit fell 3 percent to $388 million. The unit
received a $950 million order from Canada to upgrade that
country''s fleet of LAV III light armored vehicles. </p>
<p>Sales at the Information Systems and Technology unit fell
0.5 percent to $2.9 billion, and profit rose 1.3 percent to $315
million. </p>
<p>For 2011, sales rose less than 1 percent to $32.7 billion,
aided by a 13.2 percent increase in the Aerospace unit. Sales at
the three other units fell. Profit from continuing operations
declined 2.9 percent for the year to $2.55 billion, or $6.94 a
share. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Americas
Petrogas Inc. (BOE) have phenomenal tight natural-gas prospects in
Argentina and expect explosive output growth in 5 years,
said Guimar Vaca Coca, managing director of Americas Petrogas. </p>
<p>Petrogas expects shale-oil and gas output to reach at least
10,000 barrels a day by 2017, Vaca Coca said in an interview in
Buenos Aires today. The two companies are investing about $50
million to drill wells in Argentina''s southern Patagonia region
this year and expect to invest $1.5 billion to $2 billion by
that date. </p>
<p>Argentina''s shale oil and so-called tight-gas resources may
exceed the 774 trillion cubic feet (21.9 trillion cubic meters)
estimated by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, Vaca
Coca said. Argentina''s shale resources are the third-largest in
the world after China and the U.S., the EIA said in an April
2011 report. </p>
<p>In the first well we drilled, we found excellent signs of
tight gas, Vaca Coca said on the sidelines of an American
Business Conferences event. We''re going to concentrate on
testing the shale-gas prospects first and then we''ll examine the
tight gas ones. </p>
<p>Petrogas rose 2.2 percent to C$3.72 in Toronto. Irving,
Texas-based Exxon gained 0.1 percent to $87.22 in New York. </p>
<p>YPF Discovery </p>
<p>Exxon, the largest U.S. oil company, and Calgary-based
Petrogas, are drilling at the same Vaca Muerta formation in the
Neuquen Basin where YPF SA (YPFD), Argentina''s largest energy company,
made its biggest discovery of 927 million barrels of shale-oil
resources on Nov. 7. </p>
<p>YPF''s discovery at the Loma La Lata field in Neuquen
province was six times more than previously estimated. At the
Vaca Muerta formation, 15 wells are producing between 200 and
600 barrels of oil a day, YPF, controlled by Madrid-based Repsol
YPF SA (REP), said in November. </p>
<p>Shale producers use a technique known as hydraulic
fracturing, which involves pumping water, sand and chemicals
underground to extract gas embedded in the rock. </p>
<p>Exxon and Petrogas are exploring three wells this year at
the Los Toldos blocks, which cover 163,500 acres in the Neuquen
Basin, and Petrogas is drilling another well in the Yerba Buena
block, Vaca Coca said today. </p>
<p>Petrogas expects to have conventional oil and gas output of
20,000 to 25,000 barrels a day and be one of Argentina''s top 10
oil producers within 5 years, he said. </p>
<p>China''s technically recoverable shale-gas resources are
estimated at 1,275 trillion cubic feet, while the U.S. has 862
trillion cubic feet of resources, according to the EIA report. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer James Gorman said employees understand why the
investment bank had to cut pay, and those who don''t grasp the
reasoning need to adjust their attitude. </p>
<p>You''re naive, read the newspaper, No. 1, Gorman said he
would tell miffed employees, speaking in an interview on
Bloomberg Television. No. 2, if you put your compensation in a
one-year context to define your overall level of happiness, you
have a problem which is much bigger than the job. And No. 3, if
you''re really unhappy, just leave. I mean, life''s too short. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley is reducing pay for senior investment
bankers and traders by an average of 20 percent to 30 percent,
people with knowledge of the decision said last week. The New
York-based firm is also capping immediate cash bonuses at
$125,000 as it defers a greater share of awards, a person
briefed on the plan said. </p>
<p>The world has changed and the banking industry has gone
through a fundamental change, and we have to readjust, Gorman
said from Davos, Switzerland, where he''s attending the World
Economic Forum''s annual meeting. When we come out of this and
we start re-performing, obviously compensation will reflect
that. Until then, we have to respect the fact that shareholders
have to get paid, too. </p>
<p>Earnings Decline </p>
<p>Profit fell 13 percent last year to $4.11 billion as the
firm had a 4 percent return on equity, below Gorman''s goal of
the mid-teens. While Morgan Stanley posted the only trading-
revenue increase among the major U.S. banks, excluding
accounting gains, the firm had per-share losses in two of the
past three quarters. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said last week that discretionary compensation declined
significantly more than the firm''s 26 percent drop in
revenue. Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the second-biggest U.S. lender
by assets, told its investment bankers to expect compensation
packages that average 25 percent less than last year, said two
people with knowledge of the discussions. </p>
<p>Gorman''s own pay for 2011 fell 25 percent from a year
earlier to $10.5 million, according to a person briefed on the
figures. </p>
<p>Shareholders Matter </p>
<p>Gorman said his employees understand the need to reward
shareholders with higher returns and he hasn''t seen signs of
defections. The pay is not as much as everyone would wish for,
and it''s probably more than some of them expected in the world
and turmoil that we''re in, Gorman said. They''re loyal. We''ve
had very little turnover, no turnover of the top management
committee at all. </p>

<p>Europe did not get worse, it hasn''t gotten a lot

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan
Stanley were cut by an analyst at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) on
concern that a U.S. regulatory proposal may make the banks''
capital requirements stricter than European rivals. </p>
<p>The regulation draft released last month is an example that
U.S. investment banks operate with ongoing un-coordinated
regulatory headwinds, reducing the competitiveness against
European investment-bank peers, Kian Abouhossein wrote in a
note to investors today. He cut both New York-based firms, the
U.S. banks most reliant on trading, to neutral from
overweight. </p>
<p>The proposal addresses a mandate from the Dodd-Frank Act to
remove credit ratings from banking rules. Alternatives to credit
ratings could lead to increased capital requirements,
specifically from higher risk weightings for securitizations and
corporate debt exposures, Abouhossein wrote. </p>
<p>The regulation draft would likely cut his estimate for
Goldman Sachs''s Basel III Tier 1 common-equity ratio at the end
of this year to 8.5 percent from 9.7 percent, and Morgan
Stanley (MS)''s to 9.1 percent from 9.9 percent, Abouhossein wrote.
That would limit the banks'' ability to repurchase shares, he
wrote. </p>
<p>The proposal was released in December by the Federal
Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency. It''s part of a U.S. effort to
implement global capital rules revised in 2009 by the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision, which coordinates global
regulation. </p>
<p>The so-called market-risk rules, which cover assets on bank
trading books, were supposed to be in place by the end of 2011.
A European Union version went into effect Dec. 31. The Dodd-
Frank Act''s credit-ratings ban slowed the process in the U.S. as
regulators devised an alternative. Congress barred ratings after
firms including Moody''s Investor''s Service and Standard  Poor''s
gave their highest grades to mortgage-backed securities, which
allowed lenders to treat them as risk-free. </p>
<p>The proposed rules could be revised after a public comment
period that ends Feb. 3. A final version may be published a few
months later, according to regulators. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) is tackling crime in Las Vegas and Rochester, Minnesota,
where police departments have turned to high-tech analytics to
forecast crime hot spots and pursue leads quickly. </p>
<p>Software analytics is being used to help Rochester police
detect and predict crime patterns by creating a better database
with more reliable information. In Nevada''s biggest city, a
program called Coplink will organize data across four agency
databases, helping police make non-obvious connections
between people, places and things like mobile phones and cars,
Armonk, New York-based IBM said today in announcing the two
deals. </p>
<p>The world''s biggest computer-services provider already has
worked with police in cities such as New York, Los Angeles and
Memphis, Tennessee, to tackle crime more effectively by mining
data -- everything from arrest records and surveillance video to
unwise boasts on Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. </p>
<p>We''re using intelligent tools to help find things that
are hidden in the large amount of data that police already
have, said Mark Cleverley, director of IBM''s public safety
initiatives. We''re generating more and more quantities of
data, so you need these kinds of tools to be able to make sense
of that information. </p>
<p>Some of IBM''s policing technologies evolved from business
applications, including tools that predict what shoppers may be
tempted to buy based on their initial purchase, and identity
databases that casinos use to ensure they''re comping -- and
keeping an eye on -- the right and wrong gamblers, Cleverley
said. </p>
<p>IBM has spent about $14 billion on 25 analytics
acquisitions in the past five years. Former Chief Executive
Officer Sam Palmisano made a priority of helping to build
smarter cities and businesses through software and programs
that analyze and project trends. New CEO Virginia Ginni Rometty, who succeeded Palmisano this month, inherits a five-
year plan that includes adding $20 billion in new revenue by
2015. </p>

<p>The Naples Winter Wine Festival sold
out this year, thanks to Wolfgang Puck, Tony Mantuano and about
15 other chefs and a lot of wine. </p>
<p>The three-day Florida event, which raises money for
disadvantaged children, will serve high-end food and wine to 600
ticketholders who paid $8,500 to $20,000 per couple. One of the
top charity wine auctions in the U.S., it raised $12.1 million
last year and has brought in $94.6 million since it began in
2000. </p>
<p>Wolfgang Puck is a name that attracts a lot of
attention, Robert Clifford, the event''s co-chairman and
founding partner of the Chicago-based Clifford Law Offices PC,
said by phone. To have him throw in his time and talent for
this charity is something we''re so grateful for. </p>
<p>Before the three-day event starts, there will be a wine
tasting and lunch tomorrow (also sold out) honoring Prince
Robert of Luxembourg, the president and chief executive officer
of Domaine Clarence Dillon, parent company of Chateau Haut-Brion
and its adjoining property, Chateau La Mission Haut-Brion.
Attendees who paid $2,500 will sample wines from five of its
most acclaimed vintages: 1961, 1982, 1989, 1990 and 2000. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will host a Friday event that will
introduce some of the attendees to the children aided by the
event''s parent organization, the Naples Children  Education
Foundation, and nonprofits it supports. Also on Friday, Puck and
other chefs will prepare meals for groups of 40 in the homes of
the foundation''s trustees and supporters. </p>
<p>Treasure Chest'' </p>
<p>On Saturday, wine collectors will compete for rare and
prized vintages and luxury travel experiences at an auction that
in recent years has raised an average of $8 million in five
hours, Clifford said. The highlights include prized bottles from
the Verite Vineyard in California; a Haut-Brion Treasure
Chest which includes a mix of reds, whites and older vintages;
and a two-week voyage for four aboard a luxury ship with a
private chef. </p>
<p>Clifford said he hopes the event will raise the 12-year
total past the $100 million mark. (By comparison, the annual
Auction Napa Valley in California took 31 years to reach that
milestone.) </p>
<p>Mantuano of Chicago''s Spiaggia, a President Barack Obama
favorite and known for his masterful interpretations of classic
Italian dishes, is the festival''s chef de cuisine, an honor
bestowed on him for his service in five festivals. He will serve
caviar with burrata cheese and Wagyu steak with a porcini
mushroom salad. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley was sued over about
$1.2 billion worth of residential mortgage-backed securities by
Bayerische Landesbank and Dexia (DEXB) SA in New York state court. </p>
<p>Bayerische Landesbank, based in Munich and the second-
biggest German state-owned lender, asserts claims on almost
$486 million in residential mortgage-backed securities purchased
in 22 offerings in 2006 and 2007. </p>
<p>Dexia asserts claims on more than $680 million worth of the
securities bought in 21 offerings in 2006 and 2007. Belgium and
France are dismantling Brussels-based Dexia, once the world''s
leading lender to municipalities, after the company could no
longer fund itself as the sovereign-debt crisis dried up short-
term financing. </p>
<p>Both banks say in their complaints that the loans
underlying the securities were riskier than promised and that
Morgan Stanley knew or recklessly disregarded that the loans
didn''t conform to underwriting standards. </p>
<p>Mark Lake, a spokesman for New York-based Morgan Stanley (MS),
declined to comment on the lawsuits, which were both filed
yesterday in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, because
the company hadn''t received them yet. </p>
<p>Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
biggest recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
and the crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the

an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg News. Mary Claire Delaney, a spokeswoman for the New York-based company that owns
the world''s largest brokerage, confirmed the memo''s contents. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, 53, said a year ago
the firm needed to gain share in interest rates and foreign-
exchange to turn around the fixed-income trading unit. The
company had increased headcount by about 40 percent in foreign
exchange and 20 percent in interest rates in 2010, Gorman said. </p>
<p>Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said last week that
fourth-quarter revenue from foreign-exchange trading was up
significantly from a year earlier, while down from the third

from the third quarter and materially from a year earlier,
she said. </p>
<p>Mettler held roles including global head of foreign-

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. energy company, posted its biggest quarterly earnings
decline in two years after refining losses undercut gains from
record crude prices. The shares fell more than 3 percent. </p>
<p>The company''s U.S. refineries lost an average $2.2 million
a day during the final three months of 2011 as crude-processing
margins shrank and maintenance work at a California plant curbed
fuel output, the company said in a statement today. </p>
<p>They were hit by a huge drop-off in refining margins at
the same time they had a very large maintenance project at a
California refinery, Gianna Bern, president of Brookshire
Advisory  Research in Chicago, said today in a telephone
interview. We''re going to see a lot more of this to come as
refining margins come under continued pressure all over the
globe. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer John Watson has been selling oil
refineries and filling stations in Europe and Africa to focus on
higher-profit crude production and natural-gas liquefaction
projects. </p>
<p>Net income declined to $5.1 billion, or $2.58 a share, from
$5.3 billion, or $2.64, a year earlier, San Ramon, California-
based Chevron said in its statement. Per-share profit was 32
cents below the average of five analysts'' estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Production Decline </h2>
<p>Chevron fell 2.5 percent to $103.96 at the close in New
York, after earlier falling to $103.12 for the biggest intraday
drop since Dec. 14. Oil and gas production from Chevron''s wells
declined 5.2 percent to the equivalent of 2.64 million barrels
of crude a day. </p>
<p>Sales rose 11 percent to $60 billion during the quarter.
For the full year, net income climbed 41 percent to a company
record of $26.9 billion. </p>
<p>Chevron added the equivalent of 1.67 billion barrels in
reserves last year, enough to replace 171 percent of the oil and
gas the company pumped last year, according to today''s
statement. That was the best reserves performance since 2005. </p>
<p>The company plans to drill exploratory wells this year in
shale formations in Poland, Canada and the Utica deposit in the
U.S. Northeast, Watson told analysts and investors during a
conference call today. Even as other international energy
companies have driven up the price of U.S. shale assets, Chevron
remains very positive on that facet of the business, he
said. </p>
<h2>Brazil, Nigeria Problems </h2>
<p>Chevron''s 2011 performance was marred by controversy over
oil seeps off the coast of Brazil and a rig fire in Nigeria that
killed two workers, Watson said. </p>
<p>Chevron didn''t put its best foot forward in the days
immediately following the Brazilian seeps triggered by drilling
at the company''s Frade project, Watson said today. Since then,
the company has sought to improve communications with Brazilian
regulators incensed by the incident, he said. </p>
<p>In Nigeria, two rigs have been mobilized to drill a relief
well at the site of an offshore gas well that has been burning
since it erupted on Jan. 16, Watson said today. The size of the
flame has been reduced and an investigation is underway to
determine the cause, he said. </p>
<h2>Commodity Prices </h2>
<p>Brent oil futures, the benchmark for two-thirds of the
world''s crude, climbed 25 percent to a record fourth-quarter
average of $109.02 a barrel. Chevron gets 74 percent of its oil
outside the U.S. </p>
<p>Gas futures traded in New York dropped 13 percent from a
year earlier to average $3.48 per million British thermal units,
the lowest fourth-quarter average since 2001. Intensive drilling
techniques that enabled explorers to tap shale formations helped
boost total U.S. gas production by 7.4 percent in 2011, swelling
supplies and depressing prices, according to Energy Department
figures. </p>
<p>Rising labor and raw-material costs eroded some of
Chevron''s gains from higher crude prices during the fourth
quarter, Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones  Co. in
St. Louis, said today in an interview. Chevron''s oil and gas
business earned $23.62 per barrel of output, down from $25.94
during the July-to-October period, he said. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), based in Irving, Texas, is the largest
U.S. energy company. Exxon Mobil will report its fourth-quarter

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s biggest
drugmaker, won U.S. clearance to sell a new medicine for
advanced kidney cancer in patients who have failed prior
treatments. </p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration approved the drug, Inlyta,
after concluding it helps prevent the cancer from progressing,
the agency said today in a statement. </p>
<p>The drug will provide a new treatment option for as many as
13,000 patients diagnosed with advanced kidney cancer in the
U.S. each year, said Subramanian Hariharan, the lead of New
York-based Pfizer''s global medical team for Inlyta. Sales of the
drug may reach $555 million in 2016, according to the average
estimate of three analysts compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>We''re excited for patients, Hariharan said today in an
interview. Along with Sutent and Torisel, Pfizer now has three
drugs that will help physicians and patients with advanced
kidney cancer in the United States. </p>
<p>Pfizer declined less than 1 percent to $21.48 at the close
in New York. The shares have gained 16 percent in the past year. </p>
<p>Inlyta, Sutent and Torisel are among seven drugs approved
by the FDA for metastatic or advanced kidney cancer since 2005,
Richard Pazdur, director of the FDA''s Office of Hematology and
Oncology Products, said in the statement. The others are Nexavar
from Bayer AG (BAYN) and Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ONXX), Novartis AG (NOVN)''s
Afinitor, Roche Holding AG (ROG)''s Avastin and GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)''s
Votrient. </p>
<h2>Potential Competitor </h2>
<p>Tivozanib, a kidney-cancer drug from Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based Aveo Pharmaceuticals Inc. (AVEO) is in late-stage
clinical trials and may also compete with Inlyta if it gains FDA
approval. </p>
<p>Inlyta, known chemically as axitinib, worked better than
Nexavar in a comparative study of 723 patients who had failed
one prior therapy. Those treated with Inlyta lived a median of
6.7 months before their tumors got worse, two months longer than
patients who received Nexavar, the FDA said. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s drug also shrunk tumors in 19 percent of the trial
participants who received it, compared with 9 percent of
patients treated with Nexavar, Hariharan said. </p>
<p>Inlyta blocks receptors in the body thought to play a role

<p>R. Allen Stanford, standing trial on
allegations he led a $7 billion investment fraud, appeared in an
October 2008 video shown to jurors in which he decried damn
greed on Wall Street as the financial crisis deepened. </p>
<p>People are stupid, they''re greedy, they''re lazy, they
don''t stick to their core values, he told a gathering of
Stanford Financial Group Co. executives in Miami. We''re
different. </p>
<p>In the video, shown yesterday in Houston federal court, the
financier told his audience that the company was $5.5 billion
more liquid than it should have been. Four months later, U.S.
regulators filed suit claiming his businesses were missing
billions of dollars in investor money. He was indicted in June
2009. </p>
<p>Prosecutors accuse Stanford of skimming more than $1
billion in investor deposits from his Stanford International
Bank Ltd. to fund a lavish lifestyle and support real estate
developments and unrelated companies that included regional
airlines and newspapers. </p>
<p>Charged with mail fraud, wire fraud and obstructing a U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission probe, Stanford, 61, told
jurors earlier this week that he wasn''t guilty. He faces as long
as 20 years in prison if convicted on the most serious charges. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge David Hittner, who is overseeing
Stanford''s case, said the trial, which began Jan. 23, may last
six weeks. </p>
<p>The video was played as Jason Green, former president of
Stanford Group Co.''s private client group, testified against his
ex-boss. </p>
<p>Green told the jury of 10 men and five women, which
includes three alternates, about a monthly newsletter Stanford
drafted for his investors and sent to him for his input in
December 2008, the same month New York money manager Bernard
Madoff admitted to the biggest Ponzi scheme in U.S. history. </p>
<p>The criminal case is U.S. v. Stanford, 09-cr-342, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston). The SEC
case against Stanford is Securities and Exchange Commission v.
Stanford International Bank, 09-cv-298, U.S. District Court,

<h2>New Suits </h2>
<h2>Morgan Stanley Sued Over $1.2 Billion in Mortgage Securities </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley was sued over about $1.2 billion worth of
residential mortgage-backed securities by Bayerische Landesbank
and Dexia (DEXB) SA in New York state court. </p>
<p>Bayerische Landesbank, based in Munich and the second-
biggest German state-owned lender, asserts claims on almost $486
million in residential mortgage-backed securities purchased in
22 offerings in 2006 and 2007. </p>
<p>Dexia asserts claims on more than $680 million worth of the
securities bought in 21 offerings in 2006 and 2007. Belgium and
France are dismantling Brussels-based Dexia, once the world''s
leading lender to municipalities, after the company could no
longer fund itself as the sovereign-debt crisis dried up short-
term financing. </p>
<p>Both banks say the loans underlying the securities were
riskier than promised and that Morgan Stanley knew or
recklessly disregarded that the loans didn''t conform to
underwriting standards. </p>
<p>Mark Lake, a spokesman for New York-based Morgan Stanley (MS),
declined to comment on the lawsuits, which were both filed Jan.
25 in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, because the
company hadn''t received them yet. </p>
<p>The cases are Bayerische Landesbank, New York branch v.
Morgan Stanley, 650230/2012; and Dexia SA/NV v. Morgan Stanley,
650231/2012, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). </p>

<h2>Lawsuits/Pretrial </h2>
<p>BP Can''t Collect Part of $40 Billion Spill Costs From Transocean </p>
<p>BP Plc (BP) can''t collect from Transocean Ltd. (RIG) part of the $40
billion in cleanup costs and economic losses caused by the 2010
oil well blowout and Gulf of Mexico spill, a judge ruled,
sending Transocean shares higher. </p>
<p>BP (BP/) must indemnify Transocean for pollution-related economic
damage claims under its drilling contract, U.S. District Judge
Carl Barbier in New Orleans ruled yesterday. London-based BP (BP\)
sued Transocean in April to recover a share of its damages and
costs from the spill. </p>
<p>Any awards for punitive damages against Transocean or civil
penalties under the U.S. Clean Water Act won''t have to be
covered by BP, the judge wrote in his 30-page decision. He
didn''t say whether Transocean will be liable for punitive
damages or Clean Water Act penalties. Transocean has already
accepted responsibility for equipment losses and paying personal
injury and death claims, citing contract provisions. </p>
<p>This confirms that BP is responsible for all economic
damages caused by the oil that leaked from its Macondo well, and
completely discredits BP''s ongoing attempts to evade both its
contractual and financial obligations, Transocean said in an
e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>The decision leaves Transocean at risk for Clean Water Act
penalties and possible punitive damages. The U.S. sued BP and
Transocean in December 2010, alleging violations of the Clean
Water Act, and seeking penalties for each barrel of oil spilled. </p>
<p>Under the decision Transocean is, at a minimum,
financially responsible for any punitive damages, fines and
penalties flowing from its own conduct, BP said in a
statement. Transocean cannot avoid its responsibility for this
accident. </p>
<p>BP argued that Transocean''s conduct voided the agreement. </p>
<p>The April 2010 Macondo well blowout and the explosion that
followed killed 11 workers and set off the worst offshore oil
spill in U.S. history. The sinking of Transocean''s Deepwater
Horizon drilling rig and spill led to hundreds of lawsuits
against BP and its partners and contractors. </p>
<p>The case is In Re Oil Spill by the Oil Rig Deepwater
Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010, MDL-2179, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New Orleans). </p>

<h2>Apple, Google Must Face Employee-Poaching Ban Antitrust Lawsuit </h2>
<p>Google Inc. (GOOG) and Apple Inc. (AAPL) were among seven technology
companies that must face a lawsuit claiming they violated
antitrust laws by entering into agreements not to recruit each
other''s employees, a federal judge said. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Lucy H. Koh in San Jose, California,
said yesterday that even if she dismisses some claims, she will
give the plaintiffs a chance to amend their complaint and re-
file it. Intel Corp. (INTC), Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE), Walt Disney Co. (DIS)''s
Pixar animation unit, Intuit Inc. (INTU) and Lucasfilm Ltd. are also
named as defendants. </p>
<p>They still have an antitrust claim that''s going forward
so I don''t want to see any obstruction on discovery, she told
lawyers during a hearing. </p>
<p>The case is a private lawsuit brought on behalf of
employees that mirrors claims the companies settled with the
U.S. Justice Department in 2010 following a probe. The companies
agreed to refrain from placing cold calls to lure workers
from competitors, the government said at the time. </p>
<p>The decision yesterday requires the defendants to produce
documents describing the agreements and permits lawyers to take
depositions, Saveri said. We get to see what really
happened, he said, adding that damages in the case could
amount to hundreds of millions of dollars. </p>
<p>Google said in a statement that is has always actively
and aggressively recruited top talent, declining to comment
further. </p>
<p>George Riley, a lawyer for Apple, and Robert Mittelstaedt,
an attorney for Adobe, declined to comment immediately after the
hearing. </p>
<p>Zenia Mucha, a Disney spokeswoman, wasn''t immediately
available for comment after regular business hours yesterday. </p>
<p>Intel spokeswoman Laura Anderson, Intuit spokeswoman Sandra
Corradetti, and a representative at Lucasfilm didn''t immediately
return calls seeking comment on Koh''s ruling after regular
business hours yesterday. </p>
<p>The San Jose case is In Re High-Tech Employee Antitrust
Litigation, 11-2509, U.S. District Court, Northern District of

<h2>Virginia, Alberta Lead Suit Against Corzine Over MF Losses </h2>
<p>The Virginia Retirement System and Canada''s Alberta
province will lead a group lawsuit against Jon Corzine seeking
compensation for losses from MF Global Holdings Ltd (MFGLQ).''s collapse. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero in Manhattan combined 12
lawsuits against Corzine, putting Virginia and Alberta at the
head as their combined investment losses of $19 million give
them a larger stake in the suit than seven other applicants for
lead plaintiff, he said in a signed order. </p>
<p>MF Global executives led by Corzine, New Jersey''s former
governor, made materially misleading statements about
liquidity and financial controls, Joseph DeAngelis alleged in
the first of the 12 similar suits. He also named Henri
Steenkamp, the New York-based company''s chief financial officer,
and Bradley Abelow, its president. JPMorgan Chase  Co., MF
Global''s banker, should have noticed the depletion of
customer money, and should have investigated, commodity
customers said in a separate suit seeking unspecified
restitution and damages. </p>
<p>Andrew Levander, a lawyer for Corzine, hasn''t responded to
e-mails seeking comment on the suits and Mary Sedarat, a
JPMorgan spokeswoman, has declined to comment. </p>
<p>The main case is DeAngelis v. Corzine, 11-cv-7866, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<h2>Mets Ruling Draws 34 Similar Suits by Madoff Trustee </h2>
<p>A federal judge''s ruling in a $1 billion lawsuit against
the New York Mets owners has drawn 34 suits to the judge''s door
that claim to be similar to the case brought by the liquidator
of Bernard L. Madoff''s firm against Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan threw out most
of trustee Irving Picard''s claims against the team owners and
refused to let Picard appeal his ruling before a March jury
trial on $386 million in remaining claims. </p>
<p>Rakoff has accepted as related some of the 34 cases against
other defendants, while others await decisions, according to
court records. Two new suits were added to the list Jan. 25. </p>
<p>Defendants in Picard''s bankruptcy court suits, including
JPMorgan Chase  Co., have asked district judges to decide
whether Picard, a New York lawyer, has the right to sue them,
and for how much. They say that Picard is straining the limits
of the law as he tries to grab back money for victims of
Madoff''s fraud -- and some of them have won initial victories. </p>
<p>The Madoff trustee calculated in October that people and
companies he sued in about 247 actions had sought an escape
hatch from bankruptcy court, intended by Congress to handle
such cases, he said. Judge shopping was perverting the law,
Picard said in the October filing. He is appealing district
court rulings in the JPMorgan and other bank cases that knocked
out more than $28 billion of his claims. </p>
<p>The Mets owners have said they will ask Rakoff next month
for judgment on all remaining counts of Picard''s complaint.
Picard said separately he wants a ruling before trial on one
remaining count. </p>
<p>Picard originally demanded $300 million in profit and $700
million in principal from Wilpon, Katz and a group of family
members and related entities, saying they turned a blind eye to
Madoff''s Ponzi scheme. The partners denied the allegation. In
September, Rakoff dismissed all or part of nine of 11 claims in
Picard''s suit against Wilpon and Katz. </p>
<p>The case is Picard v. Katz, 11-cv-03605, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<h2>Chinese Vitamin C Makers Can Be Sued by Buyers as a Group </h2>
<p>North China Pharmaceutical Co. (600812) and three other Chinese
makers of vitamin C can be sued in the U.S. for alleged price-
fixing by buyers acting as a group, a federal judge ruled. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Brian M. Cogan in Brooklyn, New York,
yesterday certified a class of vitamin C buyers. The buyers are
seeking triple damages. </p>
<p>Individual class members are unlikely to have sufficient
resources -- let alone fluency with federal antitrust law -- to
institute a lawsuit such as this, Cogan wrote. </p>
<p>The defendants, including Aland (Jiangsu) Nutraceutical
Co., Northeast Pharmaceutical Co. and Weisheng Pharmaceutical
Co., captured more than 60 percent of the worldwide market for
vitamin C by 2001, Cogan said in a September ruling. China''s
share of vitamin C imports to the U.S. climbed to more than 80
percent in 2002 from 60 percent in 1997, he wrote. </p>
<p>Cogan appointed Ranis Co., a food company in Elizabeth, New
Jersey, to represent the group seeking damages. </p>
<p>The judge also certified a group of buyers asking the court
to force the Chinese companies to stop their alleged antitrust
violations. He appointed Animal Science Products Inc., a
Nacogdoches, Texas-based maker of animal-feed additives, to
represent that group. </p>
<p>The ruling is important because Chinese companies selling
products in the U.S. are being treated like companies from
England and Switzerland and Japan and Korea, William A.
Isaacson, a lawyer for the plaintiffs at Boies, Schiller 
Flexner LLP, said in a phone interview. </p>
<p>North China''s unit in the case is Hebei Welcome
Pharmaceutical. Charles Critchlow, a lawyer for Hebei Welcome at
Baker  McKenzie LLP in New York, declined to comment on Cogan''s
ruling. </p>
<p>Richard Goldstein, a lawyer for Aland (Jiangsu) at Orrick,
Herrington  Sutcliffe LLP in New York; James Serota, a lawyer
for Northeast Pharmaceutical (000597) at Greenberg Traurig LLP in New
York; and Daniel Mason, a lawyer for Weisheng Pharmaceutical at
Zelle Hofmann Voelbel  Mason LLP in San Francisco, didn''t
immediately return calls for comment on the decision. </p>

<h2>Trials/Appeals </h2>
<h2>Perelman Trial Testimony Ends With Tale of Broken Friendship </h2>
<p>After 2 1/2 days of testimony about contract clauses and e-
mails, jurors in Donald Drapkin''s lawsuit against Ronald
Perelman''s MacAndrews  Forbes Holdings Inc. heard a witness
recount how the $16 million breach-of-contract claim splintered
a once-close friendship. </p>
<p>The testimony yesterday wasn''t about Perelman''s
relationship with Drapkin, a top dealmaker who worked for
Perelman at MacAndrews  Forbes for 20 years. Rather, Eric Rose,
who heads the firm''s life sciences business, testified that he
fell ill last year and that Drapkin, once a dear friend, ignored
him. </p>
<p>I think he''s been more than aware of the difficulties
I''ve had in the last six months, said Rose, who walked into
court using two canes and wearing a cap to retain body heat.
He hasn''t even picked up the phone and called me. </p>
<p>Drapkin, the former vice chairman, is suing MacAndrews 
Forbes for $16 million that he says the firm failed to pay him
after he left in 2007. Lawyers for MacAndrews  Forbes called
Rose to the witness stand as their final witness yesterday to
bolster their claim that Drapkin breached a separation agreement
by trying to induce Rose to quit. </p>
<p>Rose testified about a dinner at Quality Meats in Manhattan
on May 14, 2007, three weeks after Drapkin left MacAndrews 
Forbes. Most of the dinner was about everyday life stuff,
said Rose, who met Drapkin on a rafting trip in the early 1990s.
Then the conversation switched to the firm. </p>
<p>Mr. Drapkin told me that Mr. Perelman had little interest
in life science, and in light of that my continuation at
MacAndrews would be disastrous long-term for my future, Rose
testified. The implication of that was clear for me. </p>
<p>Drapkin says he agreed to leave the firm in 2007 in return
for millions of dollars in severance and proceeds from the sale
of his stock. He has yet to be paid $16 million, money that
MacAndrews  Forbes says it withheld because Drapkin breached
the separation deal by withholding documents and trying to get
Rose to leave. </p>
<p>The cases are Drapkin v. Mafco Consolidated Group, 09-
cv-1285, and MacAndrews  Forbes LLC v. Drapkin, 09-cv-4513,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<h2>Dresdner Banker Says Commerzbank Bonus Didn''t Match Worth'' </h2>
<p>A former manager at Commerzbank AG''s (CBK) Dresdner Bank unit
told a London court he was suing the German lender because it
hasn''t paid him the bonus his performance deserved -- $394,000. </p>
<p>Desmond McNamara, who headed up risk management for
Dresdner''s capital-markets division, is one of 104 London-based
bankers who have sued claiming Commerzbank failed to honor a
bonus pledge Dresdner made before it was taken over in 2009. </p>
<p>I''m only claiming the amount my line manager determined
during the year my performance was worth, McNamara said. While
he received salary and a guaranteed bonus worth around 400,000
pounds ($628,000) for 2008, Commerzbank didn''t pay a
discretionary bonus he was told was worth another $394,000. </p>
<p>Commerzbank, Germany''s second-biggest lender, completed a
takeover of Dresdner in January 2009 then cut bonuses by 90
percent or more, according to court filings from the former
Dresdner bankers. Stefan Jentzsch, Dresdner''s former chief
executive officer, had in 2008 promised to set aside 400 million
euros ($524 million) for workers who stayed at the bank. </p>
<p>Commerzbank, which took an 18.2 billion-euro bailout from
Germany during the credit crunch, has been sued in London,
Germany and Singapore by workers who claim they weren''t paid
what they were owed after the buyout. </p>
<p>Earlier, Commerzbank lawyer Tom Linden set out the
Frankfurt-based lender''s case, saying the 400 million-euro
promise made by Jentzsch at a 2008 meeting cannot have been
intended to be legally binding even if it genuinely represented
the intentions of the bank. </p>
<p>The cases include: Mr. Fahmi Anar  Others v. Dresdner
Kleinwort Limited, Commerzbank AG (CBK), High Court of Justice,
Queen''s Bench Division, HQ09X05230 and Richard Attrill  71
others v. Dresdner Kleinwort Limited, Commerzbank AG, HQ09X04007 </p>
<h2>Chevron Bid to Block Judgment Rejected by Appeals Court </h2>
<p>A U.S. appeals court blocked Chevron Corp. (CVX) from using a New
York law to try to bar a group of Ecuadoreans from collecting on
an $18 billion judgment in an environmental damage lawsuit. </p>
<p>The appeals court yesterday reversed a lower-court order,
saying Chevron can''t use the law against the plaintiffs before
they try to collect. </p>
<p>Chevron will have its opportunity to challenge the
judgment''s enforcement under this act at such time, if any, as
judgment-creditors seek to enforce the judgment in New York, a
three-judge panel of the Manhattan-based court said yesterday. </p>
<p>In March, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan
issued a ruling that barred Ecuador residents in the Amazon
River Basin from enforcing an $18 billion judgment awarded by a
court in their country until a separate suit by Chevron against
the villagers and their lawyers is decided. </p>
<p>A grave injustice against the Ecuadorians has been set
right by today''s 2nd Circuit ruling, Karen Hinton, a
spokeswoman for the plaintiffs, said in a statement. It
rebukes Chevron''s abusive legal tactics of the past two years. </p>
<p>Chevron was ordered Feb. 14 to pay as much as $18 billion
in compensatory and punitive damages for Texaco Inc.''s alleged
dumping of toxic drilling wastes in the Ecuadorian jungle from
1964 to about 1992. The ruling came in an 18-year-old lawsuit
decided by a judge in Lago Agrio, a provincial capital near the
Colombian border. </p>
<p>Chevron believes this corrupt judgment will be
unenforceable in any country that adheres to the rule of law and
we will continue to defend Chevron''s interests against any
attempts to enforce the fraudulent judgment, San Ramon,
California-based Chevron said in a statement yesterday. </p>
<p>Chevron says it cleaned up its portion of the oil fields
and was released from pollution claims against Texaco in an
agreement with the government of Ecuador. Chevron acquired
Texaco in 2001. </p>
<p>The case is Chevron Corp. v. Naranjo, 11-1150, U.S. Court

<h2>Verdicts/Settlements </h2>
<h2>Ranbaxy Violations Include Unsafe Drugs, U.S. Says in Settlement </h2>
<p>Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. (RBXY) made adulterated, potentially
unsafe medicines that were illegal to sell, U.S. prosecutors
said in a proposed settlement with the Indian drugmaker. </p>
<p>Among alleged violations, Ranbaxy failed to adequately
separate the production of penicillin and non-penicillin drugs
and failed to take adequate steps to prevent contamination of
sterile medicines, the U.S. Justice Department said in a 58-page
document filed in federal court in Maryland Jan. 25. </p>
<p>The settlement stipulates proposed changes Ranbaxy, based
on the outskirts of New Delhi, must make to settle the three-
year-old dispute. The drugmaker set aside $500 million to
resolve all potential civil and criminal liability related to
the U.S. investigation, it said last month. The company didn''t
admit or deny the accusations detailed in the settlement, which
requires approval by a federal judge. </p>
<p>This action against Ranbaxy is groundbreaking in its
international reach -- it requires the company to make
fundamental changes to its plants in both the United States and
India, Tony West, assistant attorney general for the Justice
Department''s Civil Division, said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Our commitment to ensuring that the drugs the American
people rely on are safe, effective and manufactured according to
the FDA''s standards extends beyond our borders, West said. </p>
<p>The department in collaboration with the Food and Drug
Administration uncovered numerous problems with Ranbaxy''s drug
manufacturing and testing in India and at facilities owned by
its U.S. subsidiary, according to the statement. </p>
<p>The defects led the FDA to block more than 30 generic drugs
made at the Indian drugmaker''s Paonta Sahib and Dewas plants,
the FDA said in September 2008, three months after Tokyo-based
Daiichi Sankyo Co. (4568) agreed to buy a controlling stake in Ranbaxy
for $4.6 billion. </p>
<p>Ranbaxy consented to the proposed decree on Dec. 20 in an
agreement signed by company officials including co-defendants
Dale Adkisson, head of global quality; Managing Director Arun
Sawhney; and Venkatachalam Krishnan, the company''s regional
director for the Americas. </p>
<p>Today''s announcement is the next step in the process of
finalizing our agreement with the FDA to resolve this legacy
issue, Sawhney said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. We
are pleased with the progress we have made in upgrading and
enhancing the quality of our business and manufacturing
processes. </p>
<p>Daiichi Sankyo declined to comment on the proposed
settlement until the court approves the filing, spokesman Masaya
Tamae said. </p>

<h2>Johnson  Johnson Wins Jury Verdict Over Levaquin Warning </h2>
<p>Johnson  Johnson can''t be held liable for the tendon
injuries to a 78-year-old man who said the company didn''t
properly warn of the risks of its antibiotic Levaquin (JNJ), a
Minnesota jury said. </p>
<p>Clifford Straka, who blew out two Achilles tendons after
taking the drug for pneumonia, sued JJ and its Ortho-McNeil
Pharmaceutical unit in 2008. Straka said his doctor wasn''t aware
when she prescribed the drug that Levaquin was linked to an
increased risk of tendon damage in elderly patients. </p>
<p>Johnson  Johnson, based in New Brunswick, New Jersey, has
denied any failure to warn and contended that Straka needed
Levaquin to treat his pneumonia. The Minneapolis federal jury
yesterday found that JJ and its unit failed to provide
reasonably adequate warnings, while also ruling that this wasn''t
the cause of Straka''s injuries. The verdict is the companies''
third straight trial win. </p>
<p>We are trying to understand how the jury arrived at the
verdict, Ronald Goldser, Straka''s attorney, said in an
interview. If the warning is inadequate, what is it the doctor
did wrong? </p>
<p>The company is pleased with the verdict, Foster said in
an e-mail yesterday. When used according to the product
labeling, Levaquin has been proven to be a safe and effective
medication. </p>
<p>The lawsuit was the third federal case to go to trial in
Minnesota alleging the unit, now known as Janssen
Pharmaceuticals, downplayed the risks of the antibiotic to boost
sales. JJ lost the first, a jury verdict for $1.8 million in
2010, and won the second last year. The company also won the
first state case in October, when a New Jersey jury rejected the
claims of two plaintiffs. </p>
<p>JJ is facing more than 3,700 claims involving Levaquin in
state and federal courts, Bill Foster, a company spokesman, said
in an e-mail. The 2010 trial loss has been appealed and 43 cases
have been dismissed, he said. </p>
<p>The case is Straka v. Johnson  Johnson, 08-05742, combined
for trial in In re Levaquin Products Liability Litigation, 08-
md-01943, U.S. District Court, District of Minnesota
(Minneapolis). </p>

<h2>On The Docket </h2>
<h2>Ex-UBS Municipal Derivatives Chief Faces July Criminal Trial </h2>
<p>Peter Ghavami, former co-head of UBS AG''s (UBSN) municipal-
derivatives group, will go on trial July 9 along with two
colleagues, Gary Heinz and Michael Welty, in a municipal bond
bid-rigging case, a federal judge said. </p>
<p>The three, who have pleaded not guilty, are accused in a
six-count indictment of engaging in complex fraud schemes and
conspiracies that subverted competition in the market for
municipal finance contracts and deprived municipal bond issuers
of the benefits of their investments, according to court
documents. U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood in Manhattan set the
trial date yesterday. </p>
<p>The case is one of three brought by the U.S. Justice
Department''s antitrust unit in connection with a nationwide bid-
rigging probe of contracts used by states and local governments
to invest municipal-bond proceeds. </p>
<p>The conspiracy included more than 200 deals involving state
agencies, local governments and non-profits across the country,
according to documents filed in federal court. </p>
<p>The amount of evidence collected in the case is massive,
Charles Stillman, a lawyer for Ghavami, said in court. The U.S.
has provided more than 600,000 audiotapes and hundreds of
millions of documents, he said. </p>
<p>An unidentified municipality hired Ghavami''s firm to handle
the bidding for the investment of bond proceeds, government
prosecutors allege. Ghavami preselected the winning bidder in
exchange for a kickback to his employer, whom the government
didn''t identify, in a conspiracy that began in October 2001 and
ran until February 2002, according to the U.S. </p>
<p>Stillman, Jonathan Halpern, a lawyer for Heinz, and Gregory
Poe, a lawyer for Welty, all declined to comment after court. </p>

<p>U.K. Prosecutor''s Fraud Chief Joins Jones Day as Departures Rise </p>
<p>Glyn Powell, a senior attorney at the U.K. Serious Fraud

the number of departures under the current director. </p>
<p>Powell, the former head of fraud and assurance at the SFO,

<p>Better Place LLC, a U.S. startup
developing charging stations for electric vehicles, predicts the
tipping point for electric car use will come as soon as
2015, Chairman Idan Ofer said today. </p>
<p>The fact is that because we are making it convenient for
customers and the moment people realize there is no disadvantage
to owning an electric car they will buy the models, Ofer said
in an interview with Bloomberg TV in Davos, Switzerland. </p>
<p>Better Place, based in Palo Alto, California, started
putting its first cars on the road in Israel this week and
expects to go public in the next two years, Chief Executive
Officer Shai Agassi said on Jan. 24. </p>
<p>The company has raised $750 million since it was founded
four years ago and is in partnership with Renault SA (RNO) to install
electric-car charging systems in Israel (ILCO), Denmark and Australia.
Cars are expected to start using the company network in Denmark
within weeks and in Australia later this year. </p>
<p>Ofer''s family owns Israel Corp., which has a stake of about
30 percent in Better Place. Ofer said the company''s largest
potential market is China, where Better Place opened a visitors''
center in the southern city of Guangzhou last month. </p>
<h2>China Growth </h2>
<p>That is no question that China will go electric, Ofer
said. By 2015, their government policy is to have 1 million
cars on the road. China is definitely the target. In fact, the
main reason I invested in this company is because I was thinking
China. </p>
<p>Plug-in hybrids and all-electric vehicles have the
potential to make up 9 percent of auto sales in 2020, according
to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. That could rise to 22 percent
of sales by 2030, or 4 million vehicles. </p>
<p>At the same time, their high price and low performance
compared with conventional vehicles may be a hurdle to growth,
U.K. market-research company Technavio said in an August 2011
report. </p>
<p>The tipping point? said Ofer. I would say it''s 2015,
2016. </p>

<p>Sanlam Ltd. (SLM), South Africa''s largest
insurer, said it''s in talks to buy U.S. lender JPMorgan Chase 
Co.''s fund administration unit to expand in its home market. </p>
<p>The insurer''s investment unit will form a joint venture
with the asset management arm of London-based Old Mutual Plc (ONL) to
buy the operation, which oversees about 1 trillion rand ($127
billion), Johan van der Merwe, head of Sanlam (SLM)''s investment unit,
said by telephone from Cape Town today. Juliana Wheeler, a
spokeswoman for JPMorgan in London, declined to comment. </p>
<p>The U.S. lender bought the South African fund-services
business, formerly called TASC Administration, from Sanlam in
2004 to provide payment-processing and cash-management services
for money managers. TASC was South Africa''s largest independent
third-party administrator, with 140 employees, 15 clients and
about 320 billion rand of assets under administration, JPMorgan
said at the time. The Sanlam and Old Mutual (OML) units are JPMorgan''s
largest fund-service clients in South Africa, according to
Sanlam. </p>
<p>JPMorgan had very good intentions when it started the
business but has strategically decided to exit, van der Merwe
said. JPMorgan is being very accommodating. </p>
<p>The old TASC unit now has at least 200 employees who are
likely to be moved into Sanlam and Old Mutual''s joint-venture
company, Van der Merwe said. Diane Radley, chief executive
officer of Old Mutual Investment Group in South Africa, didn''t
immediately respond to a telephone message seeking comment. </p>
<h2>Absa, Cadiz </h2>
<p>The fund administration unit is part of New York-based
JPMorgan''s treasury and securities operation, which posted a 3
percent decline in fourth-quarter profit from the year-earlier
period. The bank began offering rand-clearing services in South
Africa in November for the first time. </p>
<p>Maitland Group, a European-based fund administrator, is
JPMorgan''s largest competitor in South Africa, according to
Andre le Roux, business development manager for Maitland, who
said his company has about 920 billion rand in funds under
administration in South Africa. His firm is seeking to win
clients from JPMorgan including Absa Asset Management Ltd., and
Cadiz Holdings Ltd. (CDZ), he said. </p>
<p>Old Mutual fell 1.7 percent to 146.1 pence in London
trading today. Sanlam slid 1.2 percent to 29.95 rand by the 5
p.m. close in Johannesburg. </p>

U.S. bank since the lender''s own a year ago. </p>
<p>The biggest U.S. bank will sell five-year fixed-rate bonds
yielding 80 basis points more than the yen swap rate, according
to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. The sale is
slated for Feb. 2, the person said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan will also sell same-maturity floating-rate notes
yielding 95 basis points more than the three-month London

<p>The bank was the first U.S. financial borrower last year to
tap the yen market since the collapse of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. in September 2008. JPMorgan on Feb. 15 raised
111.1 billion yen ($1.45 billion) in Samurai bonds, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The sale was followed by Aflac Inc.
in June, and General Electric Capital Corp. in November, the
data show. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s last Samurai offering included a 76.9 billion
yen sale of five-year 1.05 percent bonds priced to yield 25
basis points more than the yen swap rate, according to data

<p>More than half of the derivatives-
trading business of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Morgan Stanley and
three other large banks could fall largely outside the Dodd-
Frank Act if they succeed in lobbying regulators to exempt their
overseas operations, government records show. </p>
<p>The debate over the reach of Dodd-Frank has been among the
most contentious aspects of the regulatory overhaul enacted by
President Barack Obama after the 2008 credit crisis. The banks
have met with regulators, testified to Congress and filed dozens
of letters contending that they will suffer a competitive
disadvantage if the regulations apply to their foreign arms. </p>
<p>Banking lobbyists have been gaining traction with their
argument that a combination of U.S. supervision of their holding
companies and foreign supervision of their operations abroad is
sufficient to oversee risk to the financial system. </p>
<p>While the banks haven''t publicized how much of their swaps
business is overseas, they file quarterly statements to the
Federal Reserve. A Bloomberg News analysis of the filings shows
that Goldman Sachs had 62 percent of its $134 billion in fair-
value derivatives assets and liabilities in non-U.S. branches or
subsidiaries for international banking as of Sept. 30, while 77
percent of Morgan Stanley (MS)''s $101 billion was in non-U.S.
operations. </p>
<p>If overseas operations aren''t subject to U.S. rules or
equivalent regulation by other nations, it could impede the goal
of preventing another credit crisis, Darrell Duffie, professor
at Stanford University''s Graduate School of Business, said in a
telephone interview. </p>
<p>Not only is that neglectful from a viewpoint of systemic
risk as it sits today, but it''s also an incitement to move the
risk abroad, Duffie said. </p>
<h2>JPMorgan and Citigroup </h2>
<p>The Fed filings show that JPMorgan Chase  Co. had 59
percent of its $188 billion in overseas branches or
international affiliates; Citigroup Inc. (C) had 53 percent of $122
billion; and Bank of America Corp. had half of $125 billion in
non-U.S. operations in the same period. </p>
<p>The fair-value assets and liabilities include the value of
interest rate, foreign exchange, commodity, equity and credit
derivatives that are held for trading purposes and marked at
market prices. </p>
<p>JPMorgan uses a different method to determine the size of
its derivatives business, according to a person familiar with
the bank''s operations. As a consolidated bank, JPMorgan
calculates that it has $30 billion in derivatives exposure once
assets and liabilities are netted. The exposure includes 53
percent, or $16 billion, in foreign branches and subsidiaries,
and 47 percent, or $14 billion, in domestic offices, said the
person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the bank has 
not authorized employees to speak publicly on the matter. </p>
<h2>Proposed Rules </h2>
<p>Spokesmen Michael S. Duvally of Goldman Sachs, Mary Claire Delaney of Morgan Stanley, Molly Millerwise Meiners of Citigroup
and Jerry Dubrowski of Bank of America declined to comment. Joe
Pavel, a spokesman for the Federal Reserve, declined to comment
on the reach of Dodd-Frank. </p>
<p>The banks have been focused on rules that the Fed, Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. and Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency proposed in April, requiring capital and margin to be
set aside to reduce risk in non-cleared trades. </p>
<p>Dodd-Frank aims to have most derivatives guaranteed by
clearinghouses that stand between buyers and sellers and traded
on public exchanges or other venues. The law requires regulators
to set capital and margin for trades that remain non-cleared, or
transacted directly between buyers and sellers. Non-cleared
trades can be more profitable for dealers. </p>
<h2>No Lesser Risk'' </h2>
<p>The regulators said in their April proposal that foreign
swaps pose no lesser risk to a U.S. company because of their
location and noted that an exemption might allow banks to design
swaps to evade the law by using their overseas affiliates. While
global regulators are looking to establish an international
regulatory system for margin to level the playing field, they
have yet to announce a plan. </p>
<p>The tension about the scope of the rules has its roots in a
part of Dodd-Frank known among lawyers and regulators as 722d,
for its section number in the law. Under the provision, the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which has authority to
regulate most of the U.S. swaps market, may apply its rules to
transactions with a direct and significant connection with
activities in, or effect on, commerce of the United States. </p>
<p>Dodd-Frank expresses clear congressional intent that it
apply to certain extraterritorial activities, Dan Berkovitz,
the CFTC''s general counsel, said last year at a day-long agency
meeting with banks, energy companies and exchanges. </p>
<h2>Goldman Counterparties </h2>
<p>The provision raised the stakes for banks because their
swaps business is global. In 2008, Sally Davies, a Fed adviser,
said that between 55 percent and 75 percent of U.S. banks''
notional derivatives exposure was with non-U.S. residents. </p>
<p>For example, New York-based Goldman Sachs''s largest
counterparty for credit derivatives on the eve of the credit
crisis in June 2008 was Deutsche Bank AG (DB)''s London branch; its
third-largest interest-rate derivatives counterparty was
JPMorgan''s London branch; and its largest counterparty for
currency products was Royal Bank of Scotland Plc''s London
branch, according to a 2010 report from the Financial Crisis
Inquiry Commission, a U.S. panel that investigated the crisis. </p>
<p>Selling over-the-counter derivatives is among the most
lucrative business for financial companies, with U.S. bank
holding companies reporting $14 billion in trading revenue in
the third quarter of 2011, according to the OCC. The five banks
control 95 percent of cash and derivatives trading for U.S. bank
holding companies, which had $326 trillion in notional
derivatives as of Sept. 30, the agency said. </p>
<h2>Allies in Congress </h2>
<p>In seeking the foreign exemption, the five banks have
enlisted H. Rodgin Cohen and Kenneth M. Raisler, among other
lawyers at New York-based Sullivan  Cromwell LLP. Edward J. Rosen, a New York-based partner at Cleary Gottlieb Steen 
Hamilton LLP, has taken a similar position as representative of
a dozen U.S. and international banks, including UBS Securities
LLC and Barclays Capital. </p>
<p>The lobbying has found allies in Congress and among
regulators as agencies prepare to complete their rules before
2013. Senator Tim Johnson, a South Dakota Democrat and chairman
of the Senate Banking Committee, and Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat and namesake of the law, are
among lawmakers from both parties urging regulators to focus
their rules primarily on the banks'' U.S. businesses. </p>
<p>If those margin rules for foreign operations are
maintained and Europeans and other foreign jurisdictions do not
match it, that would be a significant competitive
disadvantage, Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke testified to
Congress on July 21. John Walsh, acting Comptroller of the
Currency, said on Jan. 26 that regulators understand the
industry''s concerns and will be carefully considering all of
the issues raised. </p>
<h2>Edge Corporations </h2>
<p>Derivatives, including swaps, are financial contracts tied
to interest rates, commodities or events, such as the default of
a company. The values of overseas derivatives held by individual
banks that were calculated for this story include assets and
liabilities for foreign branches and subsidiaries, including so-
called Edge corporations. </p>
<p>Edge corporations, formed under the 1919 Edge Act on
international banking, are bank subsidiaries for which Congress
granted greater leeway to compete overseas. Citibank Overseas
Investment Corp., J.P.Morgan International Finance Limited and
Bankamerica International Financial Corp. are among Edge
subsidiaries that have interest rate and equity derivatives and
could benefit from an exemption. </p>
<h2>Edge Numbers </h2>
<p>The banks don''t report the holdings of Edge corporations in
their standard quarterly filings. According to documents
obtained through a public records request to the Fed, Citibank''s
Edge corporation had a combined $7.8 billion in fair-value
derivatives as trading assets and liabilities in the first
quarter of 2011, while JPMorgan''s had $88 billion. </p>
<p>Banks are seeking to have Edge corporations and other
international affiliates exempted from Dodd-Frank rules when
they have contracts with non-U.S. companies, Sullivan  Cromwell
said in a letter on June 29. The exemption should also cover the
subsidiaries'' swaps with foreign-based affiliates of other U.S.
companies because the trades don''t have a direct and significant
effect on U.S. commerce, the law firm said in its letter. Under
the requested exemption, two U.S. companies could trade swaps
outside of Dodd-Frank rules so long as their overseas affiliates
engaged in the transaction. </p>
<p>The combination of U.S. banking supervision at the parent
company level and foreign regulation of overseas operations is
sufficient to protect the U.S. financial system, according to
the Sullivan  Cromwell lawyers. </p>
<h2>Preventing an AIG </h2>
<p>U.S. and European Union regulators have said they want to
bridge international gaps to avoid disparities that helped
undermine oversight of American International Group Inc. (AIG) in 2007
and 2008 and contributed to a $180 billion taxpayer bailout. The
insurer booked many of its swaps in Europe, where regulators in
2007 decided that U.S. authorities should have oversight. That
transatlantic split excluded any comprehensive examination and
regulation of AIG''s credit-default swaps, the U.S.
Congressional Oversight Panel said in a June 2010 report. </p>
<p>Still, gaps have emerged since the heads of the G-20
countries, a group consisting of the world''s richest nations,
met in Pittsburgh in 2009 to plan financial regulatory changes. </p>
<p>For example, the CFTC approved new limits on speculation in
oil, natural gas and other commodities, while British regulators
oppose hard government-set caps. The U.S. also aims to prohibit
a single dealer from owning and running a swaps-trading venue.
Other G-20 countries say multi-dealer platforms aren''t essential
to the market overhaul, the Financial Stability Board, an
international panel set up to monitor the implementation of
derivatives rules globally, said in an Oct. 11 report. </p>
<h2>Waiting for SEC </h2>
<p>CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler said this month that his agency
won''t complete guidelines on the reach of Dodd-Frank until after
April, while the financial industry waits for a similar proposal
from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Gensler has said
the CFTC may eventually defer to foreign regulators when they
have comparable and consistent regulations. </p>
<p>This is the obvious place for harmonization -- for
regulators to get together across jurisdictions to work this
out, because otherwise you end up trampling on each other''s feet
and possibly going at cross purposes, Duffie said. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Valero Energy
Corp. (VLO) received notices from the United Steelworkers union of its
intent to strike at refineries in Montana and Texas if a
national labor contract expires tonight without an agreement. </p>
<p>The 24-hour notices were for Exxon''s Billings, Montana,
plant and Valero''s Port Arthur, Texas, refinery, according to
the companies. </p>
<p>USW negotiators and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), bargaining in
Austin, Texas, on behalf of the companies, have failed to reach
agreement on a new three-year contract after 14 days of talks.
The national contract expires at midnight Houston time. </p>
<p>Valero will continue to operate its Port Arthur refinery in
the event of a work stoppage, while closing its Memphis
refinery, Chief Executive Officer Bill Kleese said today on a
conference call with analysts and investors. He confirmed the
Port Arthur notice today at the same time. </p>
<p>Rachel Moore, an Exxon spokeswoman in Fairfax, Virginia,
confirmed the strike notice for Billings in an e-mail. Exxon''s
labor agreements with the USW also expire tonight at its
refineries in Beaumont, Texas; Torrance, California; and
Chalmette, Louisiana. </p>
<h2>Deadline Nears </h2>
<p>As the deadline nears for contracts covering 30,000 workers
at 69 refineries, companies are deciding whether to shut
refineries or operate them with nonunion workers if the union
should declare a general strike. During negotiations three years
ago, both sides agreed to three, 24-hour rolling extensions of
the contract before a deal was finally worked out. </p>
<p>LyondellBasell NV (LYB) will continue to run its Houston refinery
if there''s a strike, David Harpole, a spokesman for the company
in Houston, said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>We remain optimistic that a mutually satisfactory
agreement can be reached, he said. Trained personnel will be
in place at the refinery and ready to assume operations if
necessary. </p>
<p>BP Plc (BP/) said in a statement that it would cut output at its
Whiting, Indiana, plant to a level that maintains safe winter
operations. The company said it wouldn''t hire replacement
workers because that would disrupt the progress BP has made
with the USW in continuing to improve safety and operational
performance. </p>
<p>The USW is seeking higher wages, stronger protections for
health and safety and a safety officer assigned to each
facility. Shell has offered wage increases, changes to contract
language related to health and safety practices, while not
agreeing to have a safety process person at each plant, union
sources familiar with the negotiations have said. </p>

<p>It''s a slight negative, Brian Youngberg, an analyst at
Edward Jones  Co. in St. Louis, said today in a telephone
interview. The company continues to be challenged to grow
production. </p>
<p>Net income increased to $9.4 billion, or $1.97 a share,
from $9.25 billion, or $1.85, a year earlier, Exxon said. The
per-share result matched the average of eight analysts''
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Asset sales added $810 million to fourth-quarter results,
the company said. Without those proceeds, profit would have
declined from a year earlier, Youngberg said. </p>
<h2>Africa, Europe </h2>
<p>Earnings from Exxon''s refining and marketing unit fell 63
percent to $425 million for the quarter, down from $1.15 billion
a year earlier. Chemical profit tumbled 49 percent to $543
million. </p>
<p>Crude output from Exxon''s wells declined 11 percent,
shrinking in every region where the company conducts operations
except Asia, where production was unchanged, according to
today''s statement. </p>
<p>In Africa, oil production declined 24 percent. The
company''s European crude output dropped by 23 percent. Combined,
the two regions account for about one-third of Exxon''s oil. </p>
<p>Gas production fell 6.7 percent worldwide to 13.7 billion
cubic feet a day, the company said. </p>
<h2>No XTO Benefit </h2>
<p>The production declines indicate Exxon has yet to glean any
tangible benefit from its $34.9 billion purchase of XTO Energy
in June 2010, Youngberg said. The transaction was the largest of
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson''s tenure and
was intended to harness the Fort Worth, Texas-based gas
prospector''s expertise in penetrating gas- and oil-soaked shale
rock. </p>
<p>Production continues to decline and it just shows that
the XTO deal is still not providing any growth, Youngberg
said. </p>
<p>Unlike rivals such as Chesapeake Energy Corp. and
ConocoPhillips, Exxon, the largest U.S. gas producer, isn''t
cutting back on gas production in response to tumbling prices,
David Rosenthal, Exxon''s vice president of investor relations,
said today during a conference call with investors and analysts. </p>
<p>Some rigs that had been focusing on finding gas in shale
and other unconventional formations have been shifted to
prospects laced with so-called natural-gas liquids, such as
propane and butane, Rosenthal said. Gas liquids are 10 to 15
times more valuable than the methane alone. </p>
<h2>Rich in Liquids </h2>
<p>The company is targeting liquids-rich prospects in Oklahoma
and West Texas this year, he said. In the Bakken shale formation
that lies beneath North Dakota and Montana, Exxon boosted
fourth-quarter oil production by 41 percent from a year earlier,
Rosenthal said. </p>
<p>Two wells drilled in Poland to test the possibility of
harvesting gas from shale in Europe were failures, Rosenthal
said. The gas discovered in both wells failed to flow, he said,
without providing details. </p>
<p>Shale and similarly dense geologic formations have flooded
North America with gas, pushing prices to a decade-low earlier
this month, thanks to advances in horizontal drilling and
hydraulic fracturing that allowed the formerly impervious rocks
to be cracked. </p>
<h2>Rosneft Venture </h2>
<p>Tillerson plans to spend as much as $37 billion this year
to drill for crude, construct gas-export terminals and expand
chemical plants. Exxon will present details next month of a $3.2
billion Arctic exploration venture with Russia''s state-
controlled OAO Rosneft, according to Eduard Khudainatov, CEO of
the Moscow-based oil producer. </p>
<p>Exxon agreed to sell most of its interest in a Japanese
refining business to TonenGeneral Sekiyu KK for $3.9 billion,
the Tokyo-based company said on Jan. 29. International energy
companies including Exxon, Chevron Corp. and ConocoPhillips have
been reducing their exposure to refined fuels as slipping demand
in some of the world''s largest economies curbed profits. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s largest
drugmaker, reported earnings that beat analysts'' estimates as
the company''s non-pharmaceutical units and cost cutting overcame
losses from generic competition to its best-seller Lipitor. </p>
<p>Fourth-quarter earnings excluding some items were 50 cents
a share, beating by 3 cents the average of 18 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Net income fell 50 percent from a year
earlier to $1.44 billion, or 19 cents a share, after the New
York-based company lost patent exclusivity for the cholesterol
pill Lipitor, Pfizer said in a statement today. </p>
<p>A decline in sales from prescription drugs was countered by
revenue increases at the animal health unit and infant nutrition
business, two divisions Chief Executive Officer Ian Read has
said are slated to be spun off or sold. The company reduced
costs by 9 percent in the quarter. </p>
<p>Cost is where they can keep a grip on what operating
income will look like, said Aparna Krishnan, an analyst with
IHS Global Insight in London. Even 9 percent costs-down still
does not compensate for the 4 percent drop in top-line growth,
she said. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s divestiture of the nutrition and animal health
units is part of Read''s strategy to shrink the company and focus
on new prescription drugs. Read said today those divestitures
are on track, and the company would announce them this year. </p>
<p>Pfizer fell less than 1 percent to $21.40 at 4:01 p.m. New
York time. The shares have gained 18 percent in the past 12
months. </p>
<h2>Forecast Trimmed </h2>
<p>Pfizer forecast 2012 profit of $2.20 to $2.30 a share, 5
cents less than the previous range of $2.25 to $2.35. That
nickel is entirely due to foreign exchange, said Chief
Financial Officer Frank D''Ameilio. </p>
<p>Investors may disregard the reduction, since it''s
attributable to the exchange rates, Tim Anderson, an analyst
with Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. said in a note today. </p>
<p>Revenue fell 3.5 percent to $16.7 billion, spurred by a 6
percent drop in sales from its pharmaceutical business to $14.1
billion. Revenue from the animal health unit grew 13 percent to
$1.11 billion, and sales from the infant nutrition unit rose 22
percent to $598 million. </p>
<h2>Lipitor Sales </h2>
<p>Lipitor led the revenue decline. Sales of the drug fell 24
percent to $2 billion. U.S. drug sales declined 15 percent to
$5.46 billion. </p>
<p>These are big blockbuster drugs for Pfizer which are
potentially not going to be growing or not growing as much in
2012, Krishnan said in a telephone interview. It''s going to
be that big gulf that''s a challenge. </p>
<p>Read said the company probably wouldn''t replicate its
strategy of offering rebates and coupons to hold onto market
share for Lipitor even after copycats entered the market. The
Lipitor opportunity is unique in its size, Read said. </p>
<p>The biggest cuts to expenses came from research and
development spending, which fell 17 percent to $2.33 billion. </p>
<p>Fourth-quarter net income a year earlier was $2.89 billion,
or 36 cents, when the company enjoyed exclusive rights to its
best-selling product Lipitor. </p>
<p>The company is awaiting U.S. approval in March of its blood
thinner, Eliquis, developed with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. to
prevent stroke in heart patients, a market estimated at $7
billion to $9 billion by Leerink Swann  Co. analysts. </p>
<p>In March, Pfizer also plans to start selling its
pneumococcal vaccine, Prevnar-13, for adults over 50 in March.
The company''s two Prevnar vaccines are Pfizer''s number-three
product, with $834 million in combined fourth-quarter sales. </p>
<p>After losing exclusive rights to sell Lipitor (PHAM1150) in the fourth
quarter, Pfizer will also face competition from copycat versions
of erectile dysfunction pill Viagra at the end of March. The
little blue pill was Pfizer''s sixth best-selling product in
the fourth quarter. Its sales rose 5 percent to $523 million. </p>

<p>Brian Kuritzky of Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) is among a group of Wall Street executives seeking to
raise more than $300,000 for cancer research by racing up 1,576
steps in New York City''s Empire State Building. </p>
<p>The 35th annual Empire State Building Run-Up is scheduled
for 8 p.m. on Feb. 8. For the second straight year, the Multiple
Myeloma Research Foundation, or MMRF, is the title sponsor and
benefiting charity. Approximately 5,000 people in the race''s
history have reached the finish line on the 86th floor
observation deck, organizers said. </p>
<p>The event was invitation-only before last year, with
participants selected by its organizer, the New York Road
Runners. The Empire State Building Run-Up now features a wave of
100 charity runners for competitors who have committed to raise
a minimum of $2,500 for the MMRF. </p>
<p>Kuritzky, a 25-year-old securities analyst at Goldman
Sachs, was the fastest of last year''s MMRF PowerTeam members.
His time of 13 minutes, 38 seconds earned the former Cornell
University soccer player a place in this year''s Invitational
Wave, where he''ll compete against runners from around the world. </p>
<p>The competition will be fierce, but I know that, with
every person I pass, I''m raising more money to help the MMRF
fight cancer, Kuritzky, who is collecting pledges from
colleagues to raise $10,000 for every runner he passes, said in
a statement. That''s all the motivation I need. </p>
<h2>Mother''s Cancer </h2>
<p>Kuritzky, whose mother died of breast cancer when he was
15, has run the New York City marathon and an 140.6-mile iron-
distance triathlon to raise funds for cancer research. He''s part
of a three-member Goldman Sachs team taking part in the MMRF
Run-Up Challenge, which presents two trophies to corporate
teams. Goldman Sachs last year won both the NYC Triumph Cup for
the fastest team and the Spirit of Giving Cup for the most funds
raised for charity. </p>
<p>Other companies in the competition include Barclays Plc (BARC),
Citigroup Inc. (C), Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), Google Inc. (GOOG), JPMorgan
Chase  Co., Morgan Stanley (MS), Royal Bank of Canada and Wells
Fargo  Co. </p>
<p>Christine Kenney, a 33-year-old assistant vice president in
equity capital markets for Citigroup, is defending her title
after finishing first among women in the charity division last
year with a time of 16:04. Kenney, the top-finishing female
amateur at the 2011 Cozumel Ironman triathlon, said her team has
raised more than $15,000 in donations over the past four days. </p>
<p>Many of the people who have donated so far have told me
their personal stories and how MM has affected their loved
ones, Kenney said in an e-mail. I''m running in their honor.
Last year being top female was very much a surprise since I had
not done any stair training. I had no idea what to expect and
it''s definitely a challenge. </p>
<p>The course record of 9:33 was set by Paul Crake in 2003,
according to the NYRR, which also organizes the New York City
Marathon. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world''s biggest computer-services provider, is
acquiring Worklight Inc., a closely held maker of software for
smartphones and tablets to enhance its mobile-service offerings. </p>
<p>Worklight''s software accelerates the delivery of employee
and consumer mobile applications to multiple devices and enables
secure connections to a company''s information-technology
systems, Armonk, New York-based IBM said today in a statement.
Terms of the deal weren''t disclosed. </p>
<p>Using the software, an organization can write single mobile
applications to operate across any device including Apple Inc.''s
iPhone, Research In Motion Ltd. (RIMM)''s BlackBerry and devices using
Google Inc.''s Android operating system. That saves time and
money while better managing employee access and creating more
consistent consumer applications, said Bob Sutor, vice president
of IBM Mobile Platform in telephone interview. </p>
<p>IBM has said it plans to spend about $20 billion on
acquisitions from 2011 to 2015, and has bought more than 100
companies since 2003. IBM last year acquired companies including
Tririga Inc., i2, Algorithmics, Q1 Labs, and Curam Software,
extending Smarter Commerce efforts, as it expands offerings
to business customers. </p>
<h2>Linking to Employees </h2>
<p>The big difference here is the link between businesses to
employees, so they can increase their productivity and transform
the way they work, said Marie Wieck, general manager of IBM
application and infrastructure middleware, who spoke in the same
interview. It also helps companies reach their partners and
their customers, who are increasingly using this for their own
productivity as well. </p>
<p>Founded in 2006 by Chief Executive Officer Shahar Kaminitz,
Worklight is headquartered in New York, with research and
development in Israel, according to its Website. </p>
<p>IBM today also introduced new software it calls Endpoint
Manager for Mobile Devices, which helps companies manage and
secure devices used by employees, including their personal
phones or tablets. </p>
<p>The offering allows employers to remotely set policies,
identify potential data compromises and wipe data from lost or
stolen devices, and configure and enforce password and
encryption policies, IBM said in a separate statement. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)''s failed shale-gas
wells in Poland may hobble the nation''s effort to become one of
the world''s major energy sources and dismantle Russian dominance
of Eastern European natural-gas markets. </p>
<p>Exxon, the world''s largest energy company by market value,
said two exploratory wells drilled in a Polish shale formation
last year weren''t commercially viable. The gas discovered in the
wells, Exxon''s first in Poland, failed to flow in sufficient
quantities to justify bringing them into production, David Rosenthal, vice president for investor relations, said during a
conference call yesterday. </p>
<p>International energy prospectors, including Marathon Oil
Corp. (MRO), Chevron Corp. (CVX) and Talisman Energy Inc. (TLM), are probing
Poland''s shale deposits to see if drilling techniques that
revolutionized U.S. gas production can unleash reserves big
enough to supply Polish demand for more than three centuries.
Exxon''s setbacks suggest Poland''s shale poses unique challenges
that may increase costs and delay output, said Gianna Bern,
founder of Brookshire Advisory  Research in Chicago. </p>
<p>Shale exploration is a very high-cost and high-risk
business and the Polish shale market is still in its infancy,
Bern, who advises major oil companies on risk management and
strategy, said in a telephone interview yesterday. It''s early
in the game for Poland, and they have significant potential
reserves over there. </p>
<h2>Reduce Imports </h2>
<p>Poland''s shale formations hold 187 trillion cubic feet of
recoverable gas, according to an April 2011 assessment by the
U.S. Energy Department. Those resources are 32 times larger than
the country''s conventional gas reserves and enough to supply
domestic consumption for 322 years. </p>
<p>For Poland, successfully unlocking gas from shale would be
a boon to domestic manufacturers and power producers by
diminishing the need for Russian imports that now supply two-
thirds of demand, said Benjamin Schlesinger, president of
Benjamin Schlesinger and Associates Inc., a Bethesda, Maryland-
based adviser to gas producers, utilities, regulators and
financial-services firms. </p>
<p>Poland''s dominant gas company, Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i
Gazownictwo, pays Russia''s state gas company Gazprom OAO (OGZD) $500
for 1,000 cubic meters ($14.16 per million British thermal
units) of gas. That''s six times the benchmark U.S. price for the
fuel. </p>
<h2>Poor Wells </h2>
<p>Poland''s shale resources are enormous, said
Schlesinger, a Stanford University-trained engineer who helped
the New York Mercantile Exchange design its gas futures
contract. Poland should be able to capture a good deal of
those resources and reduce reliance on the Russian Federation. </p>
<p>Gazprom''s depositary receipts rose 2.5 percent to $12.40,
the highest closing price since Oct. 28. The London-listed
receipts each are worth two ordinary shares in the Moscow-based
company. </p>
<p>Exxon''s failures followed disappointing results at Polish
wells drilled last year by 3Legs Resources Plc and BNK Petroleum
Inc. (BKX) London-based 3Legs''s Lebien well and BNK''s Lebork well
flowed at lower rates than similar prospects in the Barnett and
Fayetteville shale regions in the U.S., Sanford C. Bernstein 
Co. said in a Nov. 10 note to clients. </p>
<p>Poland is cited among Europe''s best shale prospects, but
Exxon''s result supports our caution on achieving material near-
term volumes, Oswald Clint, a London-based analyst at
Bernstein, said in a note today. </p>
<p>Even so, it may be too early to draw any firm conclusions
from Exxon''s drilling failure, said Pawel Poprawa, who
specializes in shale at the Polish Geological Institute in
Warsaw. </p>
<h2>Technological Problem'' </h2>
<p>If we look at the experience from the U.S. or Canada, no
single well can provide the answer if the basin has potential or
not, he said. Low flows seem to be a technological
problem. </p>
<p>Marathon Oil said today that it''s evaluating data after
finishing its first well in a Polish shale formation. The
Houston-based company said in a statement that it intends to
drill three more wells during the next few months and withdraw
rock samples for testing. Marathon plans a total of six to seven
Polish shale wells this year, according to the release. </p>
<p>The Polish shale results come after Exxon encountered a dry
hole in Hungary in late 2009 drilled in a tight-sand deposit
similar to shale. Exxon walked away from the $75 million project
after striking more water than gas. </p>
<p>Exxon and other major North American energy producers have
been lured to explore shale prospects from Germany to Argentina
after largely missing out on the boom in shale extraction in the
U.S. that began in the middle of the last decade. </p>
<h2>Smaller Explorers </h2>
<p>Smaller explorers such as EOG Resources Inc. (EOG), Chesapeake
Energy Corp. (CHK) and Range Resources Corp. (RRC) came to dominate the U.S.
shale industry by default as the biggest international companies
focused on locating billion-barrel offshore crude fields in
places like the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa. </p>
<p>Shale formations were ignored by much of the energy
industry for most of the past century because the rocks were
considered too hard to crack using traditional drilling
techniques. That began to change in the late 1990s with the
development of new horizontal drilling practices and more-
intensive hydraulic fracturing that succeeded in unlocking gas
and crude from shale and similarly dense geologic deposits. </p>
<h2>Attractive Fiscal Terms'' </h2>
<p>Exxon sought to jump-start its shale program in June 2010
with the $34.9 billion acquisition of XTO Energy, a Fort Worth,
Texas-based pioneer of shale development. In addition to shale
wells and undrilled prospects that stretch from the Mexican
border to Canada, Exxon wanted to transfer XTO''s in-house
expertise to foreign shale fields. </p>
<p>Exxon hasn''t disclosed its plans for further drilling in
Poland. The shares rose 0.6 percent to $84.23 at 10:44 a.m. in
New York. </p>
<p>Poland has led European shale exploration by virtue of its
tempting geology and by offering attractive fiscal terms to
prospectors, the Energy Department in Washington said in a
September report. </p>
<p>Still, a likely aggressive tax burden to be imposed on
shale-gas producers may damp investor enthusiasm, analysts at
Bank Zachodni WBK SA, based in Wroclaw, Poland, said yesterday
in a note to clients. </p>
<p>Polish drilling also has been hindered by a scarcity of
rigs, water and specialized equipment needed for shale wells,
Bern said. </p>
<p>Getting the things you need to drill these wells is much
more difficult in Poland than in the United States, where the
shale industry is very well-developed, Bern said. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world''s largest
software maker, said it''s eliminating a small percentage of
marketing jobs as part of a previously reported reorganization
of the department. </p>
<p>Given the rapid changes in technology and the shifts in
how our customers connect with Microsoft, great marketing is
more important than ever to Microsoft''s future success, the
company said in an e-mailed statement. We''re taking steps to
improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing. </p>
<p>The cuts follow a marketing review aimed at reducing
overlapping jobs and better responding to competitors like Apple
Inc. and Google Inc., people with knowledge of the matter told
Bloomberg last month. </p>
<p>Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, spent $13.9
billion on sales and marketing in fiscal 2011, a 5.5 percent
increase from the previous year. Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer, who named Chris Capossela as his new marketing chief
last year, didn''t think the company was getting enough return on
those marketing dollars, the people said in January. </p>
<p>The software maker had 25,000 sales and marketing workers
as of June 30, the end of its fiscal year, the company said in a
filing, without specifying how many focused on marketing. The
company had a total of about 90,000 full-time employees. </p>
<p>Microsoft shares rose 1.2 percent to $29.89 at the close in
New York. The stock has gained 6.8 percent in the past 12
months. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), aiming to take
advantage of a backlash against Google Inc. (GOOG)''s policy changes, is
rolling out new ads that say its rival is risking users'' privacy
to squeeze more revenue out of them. </p>
<p>The three-day print campaign started today in the Wall
Street Journal, New York Times and USA Today. A blog posting
with the title Gone Google? Got Concerns? We Have
Alternatives, written by Microsoft spokesman Frank Shaw, was
posted on the company''s website. </p>
<p>Google tweaked its Internet search engine last month to
elevate results from friends and its Google+ social network,
irking some rivals, partners and users. Separately, Google
altered its privacy guidelines to create a uniform set of
policies for more than 60 products, unleashing a fresh wave of
criticism from regulators and consumer advocates concerned the
company isn''t protecting the user information it collects. </p>
<p>Every data point Google collects and connects to you
increases how valuable you are to an advertiser, Microsoft
says in the first ad of the new campaign. </p>
<p>The ad also tells readers that if these changes rub you
the wrong way, please consider using our portfolio of award-
winning products and services. The Redmond, Washington-based
company cited its Hotmail e-mail service, Bing search engine,
Office 365 for online word-processing and spreadsheets, and the
Internet Explorer browser. </p>
<p>Harder to Control? </p>
<p>The changes Google announced make it harder, not easier,
for people to stay in control of their own information, Shaw
wrote in his post. We take a different approach. </p>
<p>Google, based in Mountain View, California, responded to
the remarks today in its own blog posting. </p>
<p>Fact: Our privacy controls have not changed. Period,
the company said. Our users can: edit and delete their search
history; edit and delete their YouTube viewing history; use many
of our services signed in or out; use Google Dashboard and our
Ads Preferences Manager to see what data we collect and manage
the way it is used; and take advantage of our data liberation
efforts if they want to remove information from our services. </p>
<p>The company also said Microsoft''s assertion that the
privacy changes were designed to squeeze more ad revenue from
users is false. </p>
<p>The vast majority of the product personalization Google
does is unrelated to ads -- it''s about making our services
better for users, Google said. </p>
<h2>Social Data </h2>
<p>Google''s search changes were designed to include more data
from a user''s social circle in query results. That helps the
company promote Google+ and counter features from Microsoft''s
Bing search, which displays data from Facebook Inc. Facebook has
more than 800 million members, compared with 90 million for
Google+. </p>
<p>While Google remains dominant in Internet searches,
Microsoft has gained ground. In December, Bing had 15.1 percent
of U.S. Internet queries, up from 13.9 percent last March,
according to ComScore Inc. </p>
<p>Google said the privacy-policy changes were meant to make
the procedures simpler by having a consistent approach across
its services. Data-protection agencies in Ireland and France
have said they will assess the changes. </p>

<p>A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) unit will
take a stake in Lee Robinson''s Altana Wealth Ltd. after holding
an earlier investment in his previous hedge fund. </p>
<p>Goldman''s Petershill fund has exercised its right to invest
in Monaco-based Altana, which Robinson started last year after
leaving Trafalgar Asset Managers, Altana said today in a
statement. Petershill was given the right to invest in any new
venture set up by Robinson, 42, when it bought a 20 percent
stake in Trafalgar in 2008. </p>
<p>Altana runs three hedge funds, including the Altana
Sovereign Diversity fund, which tries to profit from movement of
wealth to emerging markets from the U.S. and Europe. Trafalgar,
which Robinson founded with former Deutsche Bank AG executive
Theo Phanos, oversaw about $2.8 billion at its peak. </p>
<p>Robinson, who serves as Altana''s chief investment officer,
is personally managing a hedge fund at the firm that will invest
in distressed debt, according to the statement. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs started the $1 billion Petershill fund in
2007 to make minority investments in about 15 hedge funds. Its
best investments include buying stakes in Winton Capital
Management, a London-based hedge fund that manages about $26
billion, and Capula Investment Management LLP, a London-based
fund that oversees $12.5 billion. </p>
<p>In April 2010, Petershill bought a stake in Level Global
Investors LP that became worthless after the $4 billion hedge
fund was shut down following a raid by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation over an insider-trading investigation. Jonathan Sorrell, who oversaw Petershill, stepped down in August to join
Man Group Plc (EMG), the world''s biggest publicly traded hedge fund,
as head of strategy. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s chief
equity trader in Moscow, Peter Kizenko, said he quit to return
to New Jersey and finish building a commercial Russian sauna. </p>
<p>Kizenko, who was born in New York, said he decided to
return after 18 years in Moscow because of the growth of
electronic trading and declining compensation in the industry. </p>
<p>The fun element has been taken out of it, the 45-year-
old said in a telephone interview today. The golf course just
got harder, and Moscow is no longer like Chicago in the 1920s
where anything goes. Russia is becoming more refined. </p>
<p>He''s leaving the industry at a time when regulators are
forcing banks to cut back their proprietary trading activities
and lenders themselves are cutting pay. Goldman Sachs, which set
a record for securities-firm pay in 2007, reduced compensation
for the third year in a row after earnings skidded and
protesters denounced Wall Street bonuses. </p>
<p>Kizenko joined Goldman Sachs in 2006 from UBS AG, where he
was the Swiss bank''s lead trader in Moscow. Kizenko, whose
parents emigrated from the former Soviet Union, said he is
leaving the company today before returning to the U.S. and the
banya''s opening next month. </p>
<p>I am no longer the oldest trader on the Russian market,
Kizenko, said. Now I can finish building up a Russian banya in
New Jersey. He didn''t rule out a return to the financial
industry at a later date. </p>
<h2>Banya Tradition </h2>
<p>The banya tradition dates to the 11th century in Russia. A
wooden log shed is heated by an electric or wood-burning stove
to more than 80 degrees Celsius (176 degrees Fahrenheit). Copious
amounts of water are poured on the heat source to bring the
humidity to about the same level. A visit to a banya begins with
several rotations in and out of the steam room to allow the body
to warm up. Naked bathers typically beat one another with birch
or pine branches before plunging into cold water or rolling in
snow to cool down. </p>
<p>There are about five to seven banyas already in the New
York, area according to Kizenko, who considered opening one in
London until he saw how expensive the rents are. </p>
<p>There are a few in Brooklyn and Manhattan, but the
aesthetics are not up to scratch, Kizenko said by phone today.
We are going for a mixture of the contemporary and the
classical of Sanduny in Moscow. Kizenko had his banya, called
Bear and Birch, made in Russia and shipped to the U.S., he said. </p>
<p>Built in the 19th century for nobles, the Sanduny baths
near the Kremlin are Moscow''s fanciest. The poet Alexander Pushkin and the writer Leo Tolstoy are said to have bathed
there. More recent visitors include the actors John Travolta,
Dolph Lundgren and the billionaire Roman Abramovich. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs reduced its compensation and benefits expense
21 percent to $12.2 billion in 2011 as revenue slid 26 percent.
The expense for salary, bonuses and benefits, the company''s
biggest cost, was enough to provide $367,057 to each of its
33,300 employees, down from $430,700 for each of its 35,700
workers at the end of 2010. </p>
<p>Separately, the firm said today Paolo Zannoni, chairman of
Italian investment banking, will take over as chief of Russian
operations from co-heads Chris Barter and Jean Raby in the third
leadership change in as many years. Barter is leaving Goldman
after 19 years to start his own investment firm while Raby will
remain and work with investment-banking clients. </p>
<p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Jason Corcoran" date="Feb 01, 2012 11:29 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-01/goldman-sachs-names-italy-chairman-zannoni-head-of-moscow-office.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Names Italy Chairman Zannoni Head of Russia</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said Paolo Zannoni, chairman of Italian investment banking, will take over
as chief of Russian operations from co-heads Chris Barter and
Jean Raby in the third leadership change in as many years. </p>
<p>Barter, who joined the Moscow office in 2007, will retire
after 19 years while Raby will work with investment-banking
clients, the New York-based firm said in a statement today.
Massimo Della Ragione and Francesco Pascuzzi will continue as
co-heads of investment banking in Italy. </p>
<p>The bank, led by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein,
has struggled after opening its first office in Moscow in 1994.
It scaled back soon after as part of a worldwide retrenchment,
returned in 1998 weeks before Russia defaulted, withdrew almost
entirely after the crisis and ramped up again in 2006. The firm
has since then more than tripled its Moscow workforce to 150. </p>
<p>The old perception of Goldman Sachs in Russia is that we
haven''t been consistent in our efforts in this country, Barter
said in an interview May 12. This is not the reality today.
Barter was named sole head in January 2010 after sharing the job
with David Schwimmer. A year later, Raby was named co-head. </p>
<p>Barter is quitting to set up an investment firm with two
former colleagues, Ed Eisler and Sam Wisnia, City A.M. reported
today, without saying where it got the information. </p>
<h2>Rankings </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs tumbled to 16th place in the rankings of
advisers on Russia mergers and acquisitions last year from
second spot in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The bank didn''t rank in domestic Russian equities in 2011 after
coming sixth in 2010, the data show. The firm was the sixth-
placed arranger of foreign debt sales, up from 13th in 2010. </p>
<p>Blankfein is pushing to win mandates for the Kremlin''s $30
billion privatization program and, along with executives from
other firms, is advising Russia on how to turn Moscow into a
global financial center. </p>
<p>The government''s asset-sale plans have been delayed by the
financial crisis, and Goldman Sachs lost out in December to
Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, BNP Paribas, OAO Sberbank (SBER03) and
VTB Capital to organize the sovereign''s first foreign bond sale
since 2010. VTB and Sberbank, Russia''s two largest lenders, are
also boosting their investment banking business and are eating
into market share of domestic and foreign competitors. </p>

<p>In the cafeteria of Hurley Medical
Center, in Flint, Michigan, a doctor walks up to the steam trays
at the Cafe Spice kiosk, takes a spoon, and flicks two grains of
rice pulao into his mouth. </p>
<p>He chews for several seconds, then walks to the other side
of the counter and samples another batch. After careful
deliberation, the doctor forgets the rice, takes two naan
breads, douses his plate with mint chutney, and sits at a table
with his colleagues -- doctors from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh,
and Nepal. </p>
<p>All of them have been eating curries, biryanis, and other
Indian staples every day for lunch and dinner since the Cafe
Spice kiosk opened here last summer, Bloomberg Businessweek
reports in its Feb. 6 issue. </p>
<p>Before, we were eating a lot of mac and cheese, groans
Dr. Rao Mushtaq, a general practitioner originally from
Pakistan. </p>
<p>My first year here my cholesterol shot up dangerously
high, Dr. Vishwas Vaniawala, an Indian pediatrician, says.
Honestly, I used to skip lunches because I was sick of eating
salads and sandwiches and chips. </p>
<p>The South Asian doctors, who, as at many U.S. teaching
hospitals, make up the majority of residents at Hurley,
eventually demanded more familiar food from Steve Dunn, the
cafeteria''s executive chef. While Dunn, an employee of the
French catering company Sodexo (SW), had never even tasted Indian
food, he made samosas, saag paneer, and chickpea masala from
scratch. </p>
<h2>Not Uncle Ben''s </h2>
<p>I couldn''t do it every day, he says, even though
doctors responded enthusiastically.  I mean, it takes a hell
of a lot of time and knowledge. It took my staff three weeks to
learn how to make basmati rice, because they were used to Uncle
Ben''s. </p>
<p>So Dunn turned to Cafe Spice, America''s largest Indian
food-service company, which has a branded partnership with
Sodexo, an Issy-les-Moulineaux, France-based company. Each month
he receives a shipment of frozen Indian dishes that his staff
heats and serves in a kiosk designed and installed by Cafe
Spice. </p>
<p>What''s happening in Flint is spreading across the nation as
Cafe Spice owners Sushil Malhotra and his son Sameer place their
curries in supermarkets, hospitals, colleges, and corporate
cafeterias. </p>
<h2>Goldman, Morgan Stanley </h2>
<p>Cafe Spice''s 17 current locations include Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, New York University, and the New York
headquarters of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan Stanley. (MS) The
company''s food is sold without the brand name in another 400
cafeterias and in more than 250 Whole Foods Market Inc. (WFM) stores. </p>
<p>In the past year, Cafe Spice''s revenue grew 40 percent, to
about $20 million. While that''s tiny compared with sales at a
food giant like McDonald''s Corp., which moves $20million worth
of product about every six-and-a-half hours, should Cafe Spice''s
expansion continue, Sushil Malhotra may fulfill a dream he''s had
for 40 years: To make his beloved Indian cuisine mainstream in
the U.S. </p>
<p>It could be as big as the sushi invasion, he says. </p>
<p>Malhotra, 63, moved to New York from Bombay in 1966 to
study engineering at City College, and later worked at Shell Oil
and American Electric Power Co. (AEP) In 1970 he and his father opened
a spice trading shop, supplying New York''s curry houses with
spices, chutneys, and papadums. </p>
<h2>Indian Fine Dining </h2>
<p>When he and his wife, Lata, had American friends over to
their house for dinner, the guests would ask him why they
couldn''t get food this simple and fresh at Indian restaurants
around town. Neighborhood Indian restaurants, their decor
inevitably designed to evoke the Taj Mahal, tend to serve
identical menus, often from a buffet. </p>
<p>There was, and is, no professionalism to these places,
Sushil says in his Irvington, New York, living room, which has
carved elephants, heaps of embroidered cushions, and a formal
waiter serving onion bhaji. They bastardized the food. </p>
<p>To showcase Indian cooking, Sushil opened a fine-dining
restaurant in Manhattan called Akbar in 1976, and another,
Dawat, eight years later. He brought in cookbook author Madhur
Jaffrey -- the Julia Child of Indian food -- to design the menu. </p>
<p>While Dawat was a critical and financial success, Sushil
wanted to emulate what was happening in the U.K., where curry
was supplanting fish and chips as the national food. He dabbled
in other mass-market concepts, including a takeout spot called
Curry in a Hurry, before opening Cafe Spice near NYU in 1998. </p>
<h2>Grand Central </h2>
<p>The restaurant, since sold, was revolutionary in its design
and simplicity: a modern Indian bistro, priced between the
greasy buffets and Dawat. A year later the company opened its
first Cafe Spice Express in Grand Central Terminal. Sushil soon
saw the potential to put these quick-serve counters where Indian
restaurants had never ventured. </p>
<p>Sushil''s at the cutting edge of getting the message
out, says restaurateur Drew Nieporent, who changed the image
of Japanese food in America with his Manhattan restaurant Nobu.
By bringing Indian food to supermarkets and cafeterias,
Sushil''s also made it more acceptable and accessible. </p>
<p>American taste buds have proven resistant to curry''s
charms. There may be more than one reason. Indian isn''t the
prettiest of cuisines: A tray of chickpea curry doesn''t have the
same visual appeal as, say, a California roll. Fairly or not,
Americans also seem to associate it with indigestion. </p>
<p>In the 2011 survey of chefs by the National Restaurant
Association, the No. 1 hot gastronomic trend is locally
sourced meats and seafood. Indian food ranked No. 173, between
absinthe and kimchi. </p>
<p>Bharath M. Josiam, an Indian-born professor of hospitality
management at the University of North Texas, is confident,
however, that a change in attitudes is underway. </p>
<h2>The Mexican Effect </h2>
<p>Indian food is now very much in sync with major trends in
American food, he says. Thanks to the proliferation of
authentic Mexican restaurants and products, Americans are
consuming a greater variety of spices and are more willing to
try new foods. </p>
<p>Brad Edmondson, a demographics consultant based in Ithaca,
New York, explains why he thinks Indian food will finally hit it
big in a video recently posted on the website of the Private
Label Manufacturers Association. </p>
<p>Ethnic food is successful when immigration combines with
international travel and restaurants to create a buzz loud
enough for food manufacturers to hear, Edmondson says, holding
up a plate of samosas. </p>
<p>This cultural exposure has directly affected America''s
taste for Indian food. According to research provided by the
Mintel Group, 13 percent of U.S. consumers surveyed in 2010
prepared Indian meals in their homes at least once a month. </p>
<h2>More Like England'' </h2>
<p>Sukhi Singh, founder of Bay Area-based Sukhi''s Gourmet
Indian Foods, Cafe Spice''s main competitor, says her company
recently introduced its frozen meals at a Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST)
store in a Hispanic neighborhood of Los Angeles. She''s delighted
with the results. </p>
<p>I don''t think there''s barriers in any places now, Singh
adds. It''s kind of snowballing, and, say, maybe in 10 years,
it''ll be like it is in England. </p>
<p>Cafe Spice''s food is prepared in a 50,000-square-foot
industrial kitchen in New Windsor, New York, just up the Hudson
River from West Point. Inside, more than a hundred workers fold
samosas, fry potato pakoras, grind spices, and stir giant vats
of curry. </p>
<p>At the end of the day, I''m not making one batch for the
University of Massachusetts, one for Goldman Sachs, and one for
Whole Foods, says Sameer Malhotra, 33, who runs the day-to-day
business with his wife, Payal. It''s all the same 300-pound
batch, and the Indian grad student at Georgia Tech is getting
the same spice level as someone in Tulsa. </p>
<h2>It''s the Spice </h2>
<p>Spice is a delicate issue. It''s the main reason Americans
will, or won''t, try Indian food. </p>
<p>If I don''t spice it enough, Sushil says he''ll get a
call from someone who has been to India who''ll say  This isn''t
a vindaloo! If you say it''s a vindaloo, it better damn well be
hot. </p>
<p>Rather than lower the heat on its entire menu, Cafe Spice
bases its dishes on four main simmering sauces. Malhotra says
that variety is enough to satisfy 90 percent of diners. To cover
everyone else, the company has installed condiment bars with
chutneys -- the hottest being sriracha-spiked tomato --customers
can add to taste. </p>
<h2>Ghee-Free </h2>
<p>That''s one of several adjustments the Malhotras have had to
make to broaden the food''s appeal and streamline production.
Curries are usually made with ghee, the clarified butter at the
heart of Indian cooking; Cafe Spice is ghee-free. Using
vegetable oil instead is cheaper, meets the low-fat requirements
of Whole Foods, and opens up sales to vegans -- a key
demographic. </p>
<p>While traditional Indian restaurants typically bake naan
and roast meats in cylindrical tandoor ovens, the techniques are
difficult to teach and thus too costly to scale. Instead, frozen
naan is imported from Toronto, and the chicken tikka is baked in
a convection oven. </p>
<p>The company''s chefs have begun experimenting with less-
traditional fare, such as naan sandwiches. </p>
<p>It''s catered to the global palate, says Payal one
morning in a small office at the processing plant. She''s taste-
testing sandwiches -- potato with turmeric, chicken tikka, and
crumbled paneer cheese with Monterey Jack. After she picks a
chunk of green chili out of the paneer sandwich, she makes a
note to have the workers chop the chilies into smaller pieces. </p>
<h2>Entry-Level Naan </h2>
<p>If someone bites into that, she frowns, they might be
put off our food for a while. </p>
<p>She describes the naan sandwich as Cafe Spice''s entry-level
item. </p>
<p>To the consumer, it''s just another flatbread sandwich
with a different filling, says Payal. People eat it, and
then say, This sandwich had chicken tikka in it, and I like
that, so what else is comparable?'' </p>
<p>Sameer envisions 50 Cafe Spice-branded kiosks in campus and
corporate cafeterias nationwide by 2016. The new locations will
be designed to resemble a market stall, complete with faux-worn
wooden trim. Customers will be able to build plates, bowls, or
sandwiches around base entrees. It''s like an Indian version of
the Mexican chain Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (CMG) </p>
<p>I''ve tried everything, says Sushil Malhotra, animating
his words with a flurry of hand gestures. This will be my
final project. Capturing the American appetite, he feels, is
finally within reach. It''s there, it''s there. </p>
<h2>Winning Over Nurses </h2>
<p>At the Hurley Medical Center cafeteria in Flint, it''s clear
Cafe Spice has won over Tracy Daviek, a nurse who had never
tried Indian food until Cafe Spice opened this summer. </p>
<p>I tried it on the first day, she says, dipping a piece
of naan into bhindi okra masala. My favorite is the chicken,
she says, and turns to Steve Dunn. You know, the one in the
red sauce? </p>
<p>Chicken tikka masala, Dunn says. </p>
<p>Yeah, and the mango smoothies, Daviek says. </p>
<p>Lassi, Dunn says. </p>
<p>Another nurse comes and eyes Dunn''s plate of chicken
vindaloo. </p>
<p>Hey Steve, she says, I don''t know what it is, but I
want a taste of that tomorrow. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. was sued by
Asset Management Fund over claims it gave faulty information
involving $515.6 million in residential mortgage-backed
securities. </p>
<p>The suit, filed in New York state Supreme Court in
Manhattan yesterday, accuses JPMorgan of making material
representations and omissions regarding underwriting standards
used to make mortgage loans that were pooled into the
securities. </p>
<p>Asset Management Fund, based in Chicago, said it bought the
securities from May 2003 to May 2007, from the defendants, which
also include Bear Stearns  Co. and Washington Mutual Inc. (WAMUQ), both
of which were acquired by JPMorgan. </p>
<p>Plaintiffs did not know the true facts regarding
defendants'' misrepresentations and omissions in the offering
materials, and justifiably relied on those misrepresentations
and omissions, lawyers for Asset Management Funds said in
court documents. Defendants'' wrongdoing has led directly to
plaintiffs'' damages, which include loss of market value on the
securities. </p>
<p>Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
biggest recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
and the crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the
market for the securities evaporated. </p>
<h2>Other Lawsuits </h2>
<p>Tasha Pelio, a spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment on the lawsuit in an e-mail. </p>
<p>DZ Bank AG, Dexia SA and Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC)''s John
Hancock Life Insurance unit are among companies that have also
sued JPMorgan over residential mortgage-backed securities in New
York state Supreme Court this year. </p>
<p>Asset Management Fund does business as AMF Funds, according
to court documents. The firm, which is managed by Shay Assets
Management Inc., had about $590 million in assets under
management in 2011, according to its website. </p>
<p>The case is Asset Management Fund v. JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM),

its acronym INRA, wrote today in an online statement. </p>
<p>The research cooperation could lead to jointly filed and
owned patents, INRA said. The institute said it already works
with Pfizer on finding treatments for bacteria that cause
mammary infections in cows and new ways to treat parasitic
infections in cattle, sheep and goats. </p>
<p>This agreement is expected to facilitate cooperation
between the institute and the leading company in veterinary
pharmaceuticals in the framework of future research contracts,
INRA said. </p>
<p>Claire Lauvernier, a Pfizer spokeswoman, confirmed the
cooperation agreement today. She did not provide further
details. </p>
<p>INRA and Pfizer may work together on developing vaccines
and treatments for infectious diseases, knowledge about viruses,
bacteria and parasites that cause illnesses, as well as genetics
and animal immunity, the French researcher wrote. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., conceding
arguments it should recoup losses suffered by fund affiliates on
investments in Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ), will drop a $700
million claim against the bankrupt firm. </p>
<p>The agreement, filed yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan, ends JPMorgan''s claim that the affiliates lost the
money on bonds and other investments with Lehman entities, and
have valid claims on the defunct firm. </p>
<p>As part of the agreement, the funds'' claims will be
reassigned free and clear of any adverse claims brought by
Lehman, according to the filing. </p>
<p>Rather than litigate the issues, Lehman and the funds
have agreed to settle their dispute, lawyers for Lehman
wrote in the filing. The agreement requires court approval. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, is receiving the rights to
claims in return and there will be no financial impact on the
company, Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for the New York-based
bank, said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>Kimberly Macleod, a Lehman spokeswoman, declined to comment
on the filing. </p>
<p>Lawyers for the funds in December asked the court to
overrule Lehman''s objection to the claims and allow the funds to
recoup the losses by using some of the $8.6 billion in
collateral that Lehman deposited with the bank before it failed. </p>
<p>Lehman argued the funds aren''t affiliates, merely
investment vehicles for JPMorgan clients who bore the losses,
and can''t use the collateral to repay themselves. </p>
<p>Lehman filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history in
2008, listing $613 billion in debt. </p>
<p>The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>

<p>Kareem Serageldin, the ex-global head
of Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)''s CDO business charged in a bonus-
boosting fraud tied to a $5.35 billion trading book, was
surprised by the U.S. indictment since he has been cooperating
with investigators for four years, his lawyer said. </p>
<p>Serageldin, 38, a U.S. citizen who lives in England, was
charged in Manhattan federal court for masterminding a scheme to
fake collateralized debt obligation data to meet targets and
protect end-of-year bonuses. Two of his former subordinates,
David Higgs, 42, and Salmaan Siddiqui, 36, pleaded guilty Feb. 1
in New York to manipulating prices at Serageldin''s direction.
The men were also sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. </p>
<p>Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, whose office is
prosecuting the case, urged Serageldin after the indictment was
unsealed to come to the U.S. to face the charges. Serageldin''s
lawyer said his client was blindsided by Bharara''s prosecution
because he has been fully cooperating with U.K. and U.S.
investigators, including Bharara. </p>
<p>I have been in touch with the government to discuss the
matter, James McGuire, a lawyer for Serageldin in New York,
said yesterday in a phone interview. He''s studying his
options. Serageldin denied any wrongdoing. </p>
<p>Higgs and Siddiqui both implicated their former boss,
saying Serageldin told them to overstate the value of mortgage-
backed assets in a Credit Suisse trading book after the collapse
of the U.S. housing market. Both men, who have plea agreements
with the government, face sentences of as long as five years in
prison on one count of conspiracy, the U.S. said. </p>
<p>Serageldin was charged with conspiracy, falsification of
books and records and wire fraud. While the conspiracy charge
carries a maximum five-year term, the wire fraud and
falsification of books and records counts each carry a term of
as long as 20 years in prison. </p>
<p>We were surprised by the indictment if not the SEC
complaint, McGuire said in the interview yesterday. We only
learned of this last night for the first time. As you can
imagine, my client is studying the complaint, conferring with
counsel and considering his options. </p>
<p>Bharara said at a Feb. 1 news conference announcing the
case that his office didn''t consider Serageldin a fugitive. </p>
<p>If Serageldin doesn''t come to New York, Bharara said the
U.S. will seek to extradite him. Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for
Bharara, declined to comment on McGuire''s statement about
Serageldin''s cooperation with the U.S. attorney''s office. </p>
<p>The cases are U.S. v. Higgs, 12-cr-00088, and U.S. v.
Siddiqui, 12-cr-00089, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan). The SEC case is U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission v. Serageldin, 12-cv-00796, U.S. District

<h2>New Suits </h2>
<h2>Swiss Bank Wegelin Charged With Helping U.S. Clients Evade Taxes </h2>
<p>Wegelin  Co., the 270-year-old private bank, became the
first Swiss lender to face criminal charges in a broadening U.S.
crackdown on offshore firms suspected of helping Americans evade
taxes. </p>
<p>Wegelin helped Americans hide more than $1.2 billion in
assets and evade U.S. taxes, according to an indictment filed
yesterday in federal court in New York. The new charges expand
on earlier ones filed Jan. 3 against three bankers at Wegelin''s
Zurich branch accused of conspiring to help U.S. clients cheat
on their taxes. </p>
<p>Prosecutors said that from 2002 to 2011, more than 100 U.S.
taxpayers conspired with Wegelin, the three Zurich bankers --
Michael Berlinka, Urs Frei and Roger Keller -- and others. The
bank held more than $1.2 billion in assets not declared to the
Internal Revenue Service, according to the indictment. </p>
<p>Wegelin Bank aided and abetted U.S. taxpayers who were in
flagrant violation of the tax code, Manhattan U.S. Attorney
Preet Bharara said in a statement. </p>
<p>The U.S. and Switzerland are in talks to resolve a U.S.
probe of offshore tax evasion. Wegelin was one of at least 11
banks under criminal investigation by the Justice Department''s
tax division. </p>
<p>Wegelin announced on Jan. 27 that it agreed to a sale to
Switzerland''s Raiffeisen Group. </p>
<p>Federal authorities yesterday also seized $16 million in
Wegelin''s correspondent bank account in the U.S. at UBS AG. (UBSN) </p>
<p>Richard Strassberg, a lawyer who represents the bank in the
U.S., declined to comment. </p>
<p>Prosecutors said that Wegelin and the three bankers wooed
U.S. clients fleeing UBS, the largest Swiss bank. UBS avoided
U.S. prosecution in 2009 by admitting it aided tax evasion,
paying $780 million and handing over data on 250 accounts. It
later disclosed information on about 4,450 more accounts. </p>

<h2>JPMorgan Sued by Asset Management Fund Over Securities </h2>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. was sued by Asset Management Fund over
claims it gave faulty information involving $515.6 million in
residential mortgage-backed securities. </p>
<p>The complaint, filed in New York state Supreme Court in
Manhattan on Feb. 1, accuses JPMorgan of making material
representations and omissions regarding underwriting standards
used to make mortgage loans that were pooled into the
securities. </p>
<p>Asset Management Fund, based in Chicago, said it bought the
securities from May 2003 to May 2007 from the defendants, which
also include Bear Stearns  Co. and Washington Mutual Inc. (WAMUQ), both
of which were acquired by JPMorgan. </p>
<p>Plaintiffs did not know the true facts regarding
defendants'' misrepresentations and omissions in the offering
materials, and justifiably relied on those misrepresentations
and omissions, lawyers for Asset Management Fund said in court
documents. Defendants'' wrongdoing has led directly to
plaintiffs'' damages, which include loss of market value on the
securities. </p>
<p>Tasha Pelio, a spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment on the lawsuit in an e-mail. </p>
<p>The case is Asset Management Fund v. JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
650320/2012, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan). </p>
<h2>Nationwide Title Clearing Sued by Illinois Over Documents </h2>
<p>Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan sued Nationwide
Title Clearing Inc., a Florida company she claims caused the
filing of faulty documents with county clerks. </p>
<p>The practices that NTC used were a key contributor to the
mortgage crisis by undermining the integrity and accuracy of the
mortgage servicing and foreclosure process, Madigan said
yesterday in a statement. </p>
<p>Nationwide Title Clearing prepares documents for mortgage
servicers to use against borrowers in default, foreclosure and
bankruptcy, Madigan said. Among the documents are mortgage
assignments used by lenders in foreclosures. </p>
<p>NTC employees signed forms used in Illinois foreclosures as
officers of the foreclosing financial institutions and not
Nationwide, often without reading or verifying the documents
they signed, Madigan said. </p>
<p>NTC creates documents through an assembly-line process,
Madigan said. NTC signers typically have little or no role in
the actual creation of documents that they sign. </p>
<p>The complaint, which accuses the Palm Harbor, Florida-based
company of unfair and deceptive acts, was filed yesterday in
state court in Chicago. </p>
<p>Diane Stein, a spokeswoman for Nationwide, said she
couldn''t immediately comment on the allegations because company
officials hadn''t yet seen the complaint. </p>
<p>The case is Illinois v. Nationwide Title Clearing Inc.,
12CH03602, Illinois Circuit Court, Cook County, Chancery
Division (Chicago). </p>

<h2>Lawsuits/Pretrial </h2>
<h2>Bank of America Wins Dismissal From Allstate Countrywide Suit </h2>
<p>Bank of America Corp. won dismissal from Allstate Corp. (ALL)''s
lawsuit over the insurer''s alleged losses from $700 million in
mortgage-backed securities purchased from Countrywide Financial
Corp (CFC). </p>
<p>Bank of America, as a corporate parent, isn''t responsible
for the liabilities of Countrywide, the mortgage lender it
acquired in 2008, U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer in Los
Angeles said yesterday. The judge found that the evidence
Allstate provided wasn''t sufficient to support its allegations
that Bank of America set out to defraud Countrywide''s creditors. </p>
<p>Pfaelzer in October had granted Bank of America''s request
to be dismissed from the case and gave Allstate permission to
amend its claims to address the deficiencies she identified.
Allstate argued in its revised complaint that Bank of America
structured the Countrywide acquisition so as to strip the unit
of all its valuable assets and leave a raided shell for
creditors to sue. </p>
<p>This is significant for settlement negotiations, James
Kwak, a law professor at the University of Connecticut, said in
a phone interview before the ruling was filed. It gives Bank
of America a card to play in negotiations. </p>
<p>Bank of America merged Countrywide with a subsidiary and
subsequently transferred most of the mortgage lender''s assets
from that unit, Countrywide Financial, to other Bank of America
operations and retired the Countrywide brand. Allstate claimed
that the asset transfers should be treated as a so-called de
facto merger under Delaware law. </p>
<p>Pfaelzer previously said that under Delaware law an asset
transfer can''t be treated as a de facto merger, which would make
Bank of America liable as the successor of Countrywide, unless
there was fraud involved. Allstate argued that the consideration
Bank of America paid the Countrywide subsidiary for the assets
was insufficient and was evidence of fraud. </p>
<p>Maryellen Thielen, a spokeswoman for Northbrook, Illinois-
based Allstate, didn''t return a phone call seeking comment on
the decision after regular business hours. </p>
<p>The case is Allstate v. Countrywide, 11-05236, U.S.
District Court, Central District of California (Los Angeles). </p>
<h2>MF Futures Customers Compete to Lead Lawsuit Against Corzine </h2>
<p>MF Global Inc. futures customers are competing to lead a
lawsuit against Jon Corzine, the parent company''s former chief
executive officer, over the alleged theft of $1.2 billion of
their assets. </p>
<p>Court filings show at least seven actions against Corzine
by futures customers in Manhattan federal court. Plaintiffs who
have nominated themselves to lead a potential group lawsuit
include Sapere CTA Fund LP, which sued Corzine and other former
MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ) executives for $90 million; Seattle
money manager William Fleckenstein, along with Kay P. Tee LLC, a
firm with a trading account at MF Global; and, together, Davide
Accomazzo and Roberto Calle Gracey, who said in court papers
they filed the first action on behalf of futures customers. </p>
<p>Futures customers currently are trying to persuade a judge
that their suits shouldn''t be consolidated with an investor suit
led by the Virginia Retirement System. While investors allege
that Corzine made misleading statements that inflated the prices
of MF Global securities, futures customers allege that he and
other executives misappropriated customer funds, according to
court papers. </p>
<p>Even the defendants and the laws they are alleged to have
violated are different, lawyers for Kay P. Tee said in a letter
filed in court Feb. 1. Investors allege securities fraud, while
futures customers file claims under commodity and U.S.
racketeering law, they said. Exchange CME Group Inc. and
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), banker to MF Global, are named in futures
customer suits, they said. </p>
<p>Andrew Levander, a lawyer for Corzine, didn''t respond to an
e-mail seeking comment on the lawsuits. </p>
<p>The main investor case is DeAngelis v. Corzine, 11-cv-7866,

<h2>Barclays, UniCredit Bankers Should Face Trial, Prosecutor Says </h2>
<p>Former UniCredit SpA (UCG) Chief Executive Officer Alessandro
Profumo is among 20 UniCredit and Barclays Plc (BARC) executives facing
fraud charges in a tax-evasion probe led by a Milan prosecutor,
according to court documents. </p>
<p>Prosecutor Alfredo Robledo asked a court in the city to put
the 20 individuals on trial for fraudulent representation in
relation to an international investment plan known as Brontos,
he said in a court filing yesterday. A judge will rule on the
prosecutor''s request at a later date. </p>
<p>UniCredit, Italy''s largest bank, used the tax vehicle to
increase the bank''s economic benefits, Profumo said at the
company''s annual meeting in April 2010. Prosecutors have been
investigating Brontos since last year when they seized 246
million euros ($321 million) in bank assets. </p>
<p>Profumo, 54, said in a statement yesterday that he welcomes
the chance to be heard in court and he is convinced he acted
correctly. He stepped down as UniCredit CEO in September 2010. </p>
<p>A spokesman for UniCredit declined to comment, as did a
spokesman for Barclays in London. </p>
<p>Brontos was conceived to mask interest on a deposit account
into dividends earned on fictitious securities, Robledo has said
in court documents. Interest earned on deposits is taxed in full
while dividends are taxed at 5 percent. </p>
<p>UniCredit in a November appeal won the return of the assets
that were seized as part of the probe, according to court
documents. UniCredit remains convinced that both it and its
employees acted correctly, the Milan-based lender said in an
October statement. </p>
<p>Vittorio Ogliengo, UniCredit''s co-head of financing and
advisory, and Barclays bankers Rupak Chandra and Stefano Filippi
are among those who may go to trial, court documents show.
Ogliengo, Chandra and Filippi didn''t return e-mails seeking
comment. </p>
<h2>Group of 500 Female Wal-Mart Workers File U.S. Bias Claims </h2>
<p>More than 500 former and current female Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. (WMT) employees filed sex-discrimination claims with the U.S.
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, their attorneys said. </p>
<p>The filings were made to preserve the women''s claims over
pay and promotions against the world''s largest retailer after
the U.S. Supreme Court last year said their cases couldn''t be
litigated in a nationwide class-action, or group, lawsuit. </p>
<p>The fight continues to seek justice for the women
employees of Wal-Mart, two of their lawyers, Joseph M. Sellers
and Brad Seligman, said in a statement announcing the number of
EEOC claims filed through Jan. 27. </p>
<p>The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision June 20, said the
women failed to show a common corporate policy that led to
discrimination against workers at thousands of Wal-Mart and
Sam''s Club stores across the U.S. </p>
<p>The workers provide no convincing proof of a company-wide
discriminatory pay and promotion policy, said Justice Antonin
Scalia in the court''s majority opinion. Such a policy would help
justify allowing the claims to proceed as one lawsuit. </p>
<p>While the justices voted to reverse a lower-court ruling
allowing the women to sue as a group, four members of the high
court said they''d have ordered further proceedings. </p>
<p>Anyone with a legitimate claim should have their day in
court, Greg Rossiter, a spokesman for Bentonville, Arkansas-
based Wal-Mart, said yesterday in a telephone interview. These
claims have never been heard on their merits. </p>
<p>The Supreme Court case was Wal-Mart Stores Inc. v. Dukes,

<h2>Stryker President''s Criminal Charges Dropped by Prosecutors </h2>
<p>A former president at Stryker Corp. (SYK) won''t be prosecuted on
charges of marketing an unapproved mixture of two products for
strengthening human bone growth, U.S. lawyers told a judge. </p>
<p>The government will abandon its 2009 indictment of Mark
Philip, who ran Stryker Biotech LLC, prosecutors said yesterday
in federal court in Boston. The move follows the government''s
decision last month to drop charges during the trial of three
former Stryker sales representatives. During that trial, Stryker
pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and paid a $15 million fine in
connection with the unapproved marketing of the drugs. </p>
<p>Earlier today, the government had an opportunity to
review some documents that had previously been withheld as
privileged, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeremy M. Sternberg told
U.S. District Judge George O''Toole Jr. yesterday at a pre-trial
hearing. After reviewing the documents, it''s the government''s
plan to file a motion to dismiss in the case against Mr.
Philip. </p>
<p>The decision to drop charges against the fourth and final
defendant in the case marks a setback for the U.S. attorney''s
office in Massachusetts, which has led the nation in health-care
prosecutions in recent years. Philip, the president from 2004 to
2008, was charged with wire fraud and conspiracy. He faced as
long as 20 years in prison if convicted. </p>
<p>We were able to give the government documents they had
not seen before that showed Mark acted in good faith, said
Philip''s attorney, Stephen G. Huggard of Edwards Wildman Palmer
LLP. We showed some of our defense. </p>
<p>Huggard wouldn''t specify what the documents were. He said
the government hadn''t agreed to drop the case until an hour
before the hearing. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Stryker Biotech LLC, 09-cr-10330, U.S.
District Court, District of Massachusetts (Boston). </p>

<h2>Macy''s Seeks Injunction in Martha Stewart Contract Suit </h2>
<p>Macy''s Inc. (M) asked a New York state Supreme Court justice to
issue a preliminary injunction against Martha Stewart Living
Omnimedia Inc. (MSO) in a filing Feb. 1 in Manhattan. </p>
<p>The retailer sued in New York state Supreme Court on Jan.
23 seeking to stop New York-based Martha Stewart Living from
executing a new sales agreement with J.C. Penney Co. (JCP) Macy''s,
based in Cincinnati, said it renewed a 2006 agreement for Martha
Stewart-branded products that expires in 2018. </p>
<p>In court documents filed Feb. 1, lawyers for Macy''s asked
Justice Jeffery K. Oing to issue the injunction, saying that the
agreement grants the retailer an exclusive right to make and
sell Martha Stewart products in certain categories and the right
to refuse to make and sell other products that are within Macy''s
product line. </p>
<p>An injunction is necessary to prevent Macy''s from
suffering immediate, continuing and incalculable harm as a
result of the unexplained and unlawful breach by defendant
Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. of its exclusive license to
Macy''s, lawyers for Macy''s said in the court documents. </p>
<p>We value our relationship with Macy''s and are confident
that we are not breaching the terms of our agreement, Jeanne
Meyer, a spokeswoman for Martha Stewart Living, said in an e-
mail. MSLO believes it''s good for our partners, our consumers
and our brand to have a wide range of Martha Stewart products
available in a variety of top retailers and we structure all of
our commercial agreements with this strategy in mind. </p>

<h2>Trials/Appeals </h2>
<h2>Primary Global''s Fleishman Asks to Stay Free During Appeal </h2>
<p>Former Primary Global Research LLC executive James
Fleishman, sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison for his role in an
insider-trading scheme, is asking a federal appeals court in New
York to allow him to remain free on appeal. </p>
<p>Fleishman was convicted in September of two separate
conspiracy charges for what the U.S. said was a scheme to obtain
and pass along confidential information from technology company
employees who moonlighted as consultants for Mountain View,
California-based Primary Global, a so-called expert-networking
firm. The tips were given to fund managers who paid Primary
Global for consultation calls, prosecutors said. </p>
<p>In December, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan
denied Fleishman''s request to dismiss his conviction or grant
him a new trial. Rakoff ordered Fleishman to surrender to U.S.
Bureau of Prisons officials by Feb.7. </p>
<p>Mr. Fleishman will present substantial questions on
appeal, and therefore this court should order bail pending
appeal, his lawyer, Ethan Balogh, said in court papers filed
Jan. 31 with the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York. </p>
<p>Balogh said prosecutors failed to establish that any acts
committed to further the conspiracy occurred in New York. He
also said Fleishman, of Santa Clara, California, was improperly
barred from testifying in his own defense after he was directed
to turn over his personal diaries to prosecutors. </p>
<p>This appeal will present a novel question, and the
government''s analysis reveals the weakness of its position,
Balogh said in court papers. He didn''t return a voice-mail
message seeking comment on the filing. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Nguyen, 11-cr-32, U.S. District Court,

<h2>JJ Hid Risperdal Studies to Boost Drug Sales, Lawyer Says </h2>
<p>Johnson  Johnson hid studies showing its Risperdal anti-
psychotic drug caused diabetes to protect billions of dollars in
sales, a lawyer said in the first personal-injury claim over the
medication to go to trial. </p>
<p>Researchers at JJ''s Janssen unit knew as early as 1999
that a study found Risperdal caused diabetes at a higher rate
than a competing drug and failed to hand over the results to
regulators probing links between the disease and anti-psychotic
medicines, Fletch Trammell, a lawyer for a former Risperdal
user, told a New Jersey jury yesterday in opening statements. </p>
<p>The evidence will show Janssen buried studies for a
competitive advantage, Trammell told jurors in state court in
New Brunswick, New Jersey. JJ, the world''s second-largest
health-products maker, is based in the city. </p>
<p>The trial of Gary Skala''s claims that his 14 years'' worth
of Risperdal use caused his diabetes began two weeks after JJ
agreed to pay $158 million to settle Texas officials'' claims
that it fraudulently marketed the drug. </p>
<p>While JJ has faced four states'' claims that it defrauded
Medicaid programs by misleading doctors and regulators about
Risperdal''s diabetes risks, Skala''s case is the first brought by
an individual patient to be presented to a jury. </p>
<p>The drugmaker contends that the study evaluating
Risperdal''s diabetes risk against that posed by Eli Lilly 
Co.''s Zyprexa anti-psychotic medication was flawed and that''s
why it wasn''t made public, one of the company''s lawyers told
jurors yesterday. </p>
<p>Nothing was buried, nothing was hidden and no one was
tricked, Jeffrey Peck, a lawyer for JJ, said in his opening
statement. </p>

Davis, testifying as a U.S. government witness, said company
founder R. Allen Stanford conspired with him in an investment
fraud. </p>
<p>Davis, who pleaded guilty to three felony charges in August
2009 and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors, began testifying
yesterday against his former boss and Baylor University roommate
at Stanford''s criminal trial in federal court in Houston. </p>
<p>Asked by Assistant U.S. Attorney William Stellmach if he
committed any crimes at Houston-based Stanford Financial Group,
Davis replied, Yes sir, I did. </p>
<p>Davis told the court he lied about the truthfulness of the
statements of Stanford International Bank Ltd., the Antigua-
based financial institution prosecutors say sold fraudulent
certificates of deposit to investors. </p>
<p>I lied about the nature of these investments, Davis
said. </p>
<p>Stellmach then asked, Who conspired with you to commit
those crimes? Davis replied, Mr. Allen Stanford and
others. </p>
<p>Stanford, 61, is accused of leading a $7 billion investment
fraud scheme. Charged with 14 criminal counts including mail
fraud, wire fraud and obstruction of a U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission probe, the financier maintains he isn''t
guilty. </p>
<p>The criminal case is U.S. v. Stanford, 09-cr-342, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston). </p>

<h2>Verdicts/Settlements </h2>
<h2>Deutsche Bank Told to Pay $19.7 Million Over Currency Option </h2>
<p>Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Germany''s biggest bank, was ordered to
pay 15 million euros ($19.7 million) in a lawsuit over a
currency option product it sold to a client. </p>
<p>The Frankfurt Regional Court yesterday ruled partly in
favor of German travel company Schauinsland-Reisen GmbH, which
had sought 30 million euros. The judges ruled the company was
experienced in using options to hedge currency risks, so it was
partly responsible for its losses, court spokesman Arne Hasse
said. </p>
<p>When Deutsche Bank first sold the product it didn''t have
to warn about risks, as the structure of the option could be
easily understood, Hasse said. But when additional options
were bought after first losses and the risks increased, the bank
at some point should have warned its customer about the risk
accumulation. </p>
<p>Germany''s highest civil court last year said the Frankfurt-
based lender had to cover losses caused by a product it called a
CMS Spread Ladder Swap because the bank didn''t disclose the
product had an initial negative market value. The judges
yesterday didn''t adopt the top court''s reasoning because the
currency derivatives weren''t as complicated as the CMS swaps,
Hasse said. </p>
<p>Deutsche Bank failed to prove that it properly warned
Schauinsland-Reisen as the risks increased, Hasse said. About 60
follow-up derivatives were sold, he said. </p>
<p>Deutsche Bank spokesman Christian Streckert said the lender
will only comment when it''s received the written judgment. It
will then decide whether to appeal, he said. </p>
<p>Yesterday''s case is LG Frankfurt am Main, 3-04 O 50/10. </p>

<h2>India''s Supreme Court Scraps Mobile Licenses Amid 2G Probe </h2>
<p>India''s Supreme Court canceled 122 mobile-phone permits
whose sale in 2008 sparked the nation''s biggest corruption
investigation and led to the jailing of a former minister. </p>
<p>Shares of Unitech Ltd. (UT), part of the group that bought
licenses used by Norway''s Telenor ASA (TEL) for its operations in
India, slumped in Mumbai as the court scrapped the permits and
ordered operators to pay as much as 50 million rupees ($1
million) as penalty, according to the ruling by judges G.S.
Singhvi and A.K. Ganguly. </p>
<p>India''s auditor said in a 2010 report the sale of the
airwaves lacked transparency and ineligible bidders bought them
at unbelievably low prices, denying the treasury of as much
as $31 billion. Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI), India''s largest wireless
operator, surged the most in 19 months on speculation the
carrier may win more spectrum when the government reallocates
the frequencies released by the cancellations. </p>
<p>Finally, some action is being taken on the scam, said
Deepti Chaturvedi, executive director of equity research at CLSA
India Ltd. in Mumbai. I wouldn''t jump to the conclusion the
cancellations would help incumbents like Bharti, since the
spectrum would likely be auctioned, she said. </p>
<p>Former telecommunications minister Andimuthu Raja, who has
denied all wrongdoing, is in jail in New Delhi facing trial,
while former officials in his ministry and a lawmaker got bail. </p>
<p>Uninor, the Indian venture between Telenor and Unitech
Group, said it had been unfairly treated, according to an e-
mailed statement yesterday. It will continue operations for the
time being and exercise all options available to ensure that
Uninor continues to operate in India. </p>
<p>Tata Teleservices Ltd., Unitech Wireless, and DB Realty
Ltd. have each been ordered to pay 50 million rupees in
penalties, while Loop Telecom and Sistema Shyam Teleservices
have been ordered to pay 20 million rupees each. </p>
<p>The government will abide by the court''s verdict and
prepare rules for auctioning the airwaves, Kapil Sibal, minister
of communications and information technology, told reporters in
New Delhi yesterday. The ministry will delink the spectrum
it provides to carriers from the permits, he said. </p>

<h2>Dow, DuPont, Denki Lose EU Appeal to Cut Rubber Cartel Fines </h2>
<p>DuPont Co. (DD), Dow Chemical Co. (DOW), and Denki Kagaku Kogyo KK (4061)
lost bids to overturn antitrust fines by the European Union for
claims they colluded to fix prices in the rubber chemical
industry. </p>
<p>The European Commission was right in the findings and fines
it imposed for the cartel, the EU''s General Court said in three
separate rulings for the companies. </p>
<p>The EU''s antitrust regulator has wide discretion as
regards the methods of calculating fines and didn''t err in the
amounts or the fines themselves, the Luxembourg-based tribunal
said yesterday. </p>
<p>Five companies were fined a total of 247.6 million euros
($325 million) in 2007 by the commission, the European Union''s
antitrust regulator, for colluding on prices for chloroprene
rubber, used to make latex rubber, from at least 1993 to 2002,
the commission said. Bayer AG, Germany''s largest drugmaker and
another repeat offender, escaped a 201 million euro fine, as it
had told the regulator about the cartel. An appeal by Eni SpA (ENI),
which received the heaviest fine, is pending. </p>
<p>DuPont is disappointed with the decision and is
considering whether to appeal, Eduardo Menchaca, a spokesman for
the company, said yesterday. </p>
<p>Dow will appeal the ruling as we continue to remain
convinced of the correctness of our position, the company said
in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Naoshi Fukawa, a spokesman for Denki Kagaku in Tokyo, said
the company can''t comment until it has read the ruling. </p>
<p>DuPont received a 15 million-euro fine and Dow was fined
4.4 million euros individually. The commission fined their
former joint venture 44.3 million euros, to be shared by the two
companies. Dow transferred its stake in the joint venture to
Wilmington, Delaware-based DuPont in 2005 and it was renamed
DuPont Performance Elastomers LLC. </p>
<p>Eni, Italy''s largest oil company, got a 60 percent fine
increase to 132.2 million euros for being a repeat offender. Its
appeal is being reviewed separately. </p>
<p>Tosoh Corp. (4042), a Japan petrochemical maker, didn''t fight the
decision after receiving a 50 percent cut in its fine for
cooperating with the investigation. </p>
<p>The cases are T-76/08 Pending Case, E.I. du Pont de Nemours
and others v Commission; T-77/08 Pending Case, Dow Chemical v
Commission; T-83/08 Pending Case, Denki Kagaku Kogyo and Denka
Chemicals v Commission. </p>

<p>The bonus for Sherwood, co-chief of the bank in London, was
34 percent down on last year and will be transferred to him over
three years, the Times said. The bonus is in addition to $2.5
million in shares that Sherwood received last week, the
newspaper reported. </p>
