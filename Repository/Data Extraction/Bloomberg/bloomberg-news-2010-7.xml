<p>The most-accurate forecasters of
Asian currencies say it''s time to avoid the South Korean won and
the Indian rupee as the global economic recovery falters. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which correctly predicted the
Malaysian ringgit''s gain this year, has stopped recommending the
region''s currencies and says the rupee will drop 2 percent this
quarter. ING Groep NV, which had the closest forecasts for the
weakening won and Taiwan dollar, is among the most bearish for
their second-half performance. </p>
<p>Strategists got it wrong at the start of the year when the
consensus in Bloomberg surveys was that the won would appreciate
the most in Asia and the ringgit would be the region''s weakest
currency. Instead, South Korea''s currency dropped 5 percent and
Malaysia''s climbed 7 percent. Now, Invesco Ltd. and Daiwa SB
Investments Ltd., which together manage $482 billion, are
avoiding the region''s higher-yielding assets as Europe''s debt
crisis spreads. </p>
<p>Episodes of risk aversion will see the won and rupee
underperform and give strong support to the dollar, Tim Condon,
chief Asia economist in Singapore for ING, the biggest Dutch
financial services company, said in an interview yesterday.
They may appreciate as markets calm down, but the path won''t
be smooth. </p>
<p>China''s Premier Wen Jiabao said on July 3 that the effects
of the global financial turmoil are more severe than expected,
after a Federation of Logistics  Purchasing report showed
manufacturing growth slowed for a second month in June. Markit
Economics reported on July 5 that expansion in Europe''s services
and manufacturing industries also weakened for a second month. </p>
<p>Contagion Effect </p>
<p>The won slumped 8 percent in the past three months to
1,222.3 per dollar, the worst performer in Asia, while the
Indian rupee declined 5 percent to 46.905. Financial-market
stresses may damp global economic activity in the second
half, the International Monetary Fund said on June 16, before
releasing forecasts this month. In April, the IMF projected
Asia''s 8.7 percent expansion this year would lead 4.2 percent
growth worldwide. </p>
<p>China''s property market is beginning a collapse that
will hit the nation''s banking system, Kenneth Rogoff, the
Harvard University professor and former chief economist of the
International Monetary Fund, said in an interview in Hong Kong
yesterday. He said the global economic recovery is very
slow. </p>
<p>Europe''s debt crisis has some contagion effect on Asian
currencies, said Paul Chan, Hong Kong-based chief investment
officer at Invesco, which oversees $430 billion globally. It
was a trigger for outflows of hot money. </p>
<p>Downgrading Forecasts </p>
<p>The won is the most exposed to changes in investor appetite
for riskier assets. Its correlation in the past year to the
Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, a measure of
U.S. share-price swings, was Asia''s highest at 0.75, followed by
the rupee''s at 0.66. A reading of 1 suggests movement in
lockstep. The ringgit''s relationship was the lowest at minus
0.02. The won''s one-month implied volatility, used to calculate
foreign-exchange options, is the highest among Asian currencies
at 17 percent. </p>
<p>ING says the won will rise 6 percent in the rest of 2010 to
1,150, more bearish than the median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of 19 economists for an 11 percent gain. There''s a risk
it may end at 1,200, an increase of less than 2 percent, Condon
said. The company predicts the ringgit will decline to 3.27 from
3.23 this quarter and the rupee to 46.50 from 46.46. </p>
<p>Spending Power </p>
<p>Standard Chartered Plc, which had the same won forecast as
ING at the start of 2010, is more bullish, predicting the
currency will rally 11 percent to 1,100 as the yuan''s
appreciation makes Korean exports more affordable for Chinese
consumers. China''s currency has gained 0.7 percent since the
central bank ended a two-year dollar peg on June 19. </p>
<p>Robust regional growth should in particular favor
countries like Malaysia and Korea that are closely integrated to
the broader region, Michael Hasenstab, who oversees the $34
billion Templeton Global Bond Fund in San Mateo, California,
said in an e-mailed response to questions. The yuan still
remains undervalued. </p>
<p>Michael Buchanan, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Goldman
Sachs in Hong Kong, advises against buying Asian currencies. The
New York-based bank, which along with Barclays Plc and Danske
Bank A/S was among the three best ringgit forecasters, lowered
its 2010 economic growth forecast for China to 10.1 percent from
11.4 percent on July 2. </p>
<p>This isn''t a good time to be long these currencies,
Buchanan said in a June 30 interview. For most cases, there is
still room for appreciation but the risk-reward doesn''t
entice. </p>
<p>Cutting Forecasts </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs in a June report dropped its forecast for the
rupee to 47.50 by September, from an earlier prediction of 44.
It cut its prediction for the won to 1,150 from 1,100, and for
the ringgit to 3.15 from 3.10. </p>
<p>Goldman, ING and Standard Chartered are all bearish on the
rupee, after the current-account deficit widened to a record and
investors sold India''s stocks. The current-account gap reached
$13 billion in the first quarter, from $12.2 billion in the
fourth, which is not what the market is looking for,
Goldman''s Buchanan said. </p>
<p>Foreign investors sold a net $5.4 billion of stocks in
South Korea in May and $2 billion in India. </p>
<p>I''m not very confident on Asian currencies at the moment
as it depends very much on global risk sentiment, said Kei Katayama, who helps oversee the equivalent of $37 billion in
non-yen debt as leader of the foreign fixed-income group in
Tokyo at Daiwa SB. </p>

<p>General Motors Co. expects sales in
Brazil to grow by 68 percent to 1 million vehicles by 2014 as
growth in Latin America''s largest economy stokes demand for
fancier cars, said the automaker''s South America chief. </p>
<p>Brazilians are getting richer and the currency is
stronger, Jaime Ardila, head of GM South America, said in an
interview. The country will make a significant contribution to
the company''s profits in the next few years, he said. </p>
<p>GM predicts that sales of Chevrolets in Brazil will rise to
650,000 vehicles this year from almost 600,000 in 2009, and then
surge to the 1 million mark in 2014, Ardila said. The Detroit-
based automaker plans to increase deliveries in line with the
market or a little bit ahead as total Brazilian car sales
advance to 4 million in 2014, he said. </p>
<p>GM is investing more than 5 billion reais ($2.8 billion) in
Brazil through 2012 as a burgeoning middle class, a strong
currency and more jobs spur demand for cars, Ardila said. The
country''s gross domestic product will rise 7.2 percent this
year, according to a central bank survey published yesterday. </p>
<p>South America is perhaps one of the most important assets
and best returns on investment that GM has, Ardila said in the
July 2 interview in Paris, where he was attending an Economist
conference. GM is focusing the investment on product development
and spending 1.4 billion reais on two plants in the state of
Sao Paulo to increase production. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp.''s Japanese unit and
Petroleo Brasileiro SA may have to spend billions of dollars
upgrading plants or else shut units because of new rules aimed
at boosting heavy-oil refining, analysts said. </p>
<p>The regulations require refiners to increase the proportion
of gasoline and gasoil they produce from residues, which are
cheaper than lighter crudes, Trade Minister Masayuki Naoshima
said yesterday. The move may force the nation''s fuel producers
to cut capacity by 800,000 barrels a day, or 17 percent, as they
opt to mothball plants rather than carry out costly upgrades,
said Hidetoshi Shioda, a senior energy analyst at Mizuho
Securities Co. </p>
<p>The rules are meant to compel Japanese refiners to
modernize refineries or cut capacity in an oversupplied market
so they can compete more effectively with Asian rivals,
according to the trade ministry. About 10 percent of the
country''s capacity is dedicated to heavy oil processing,
compared with 36 percent in China and an Asian average of 19
percent, the ministry said in April. </p>
<p>Exxon''s unit, Tonengeneral Sekiyu K.K., Cosmo Oil Co. and
the Brazilian company known as Petrobras stand to lose the most
because they have low ratios of residue-refining capacity to
crude distillation, said Osamu Fujisawa a Tokyo-based oil
economist at industry consultant FE Associates. </p>
<p>Given the bleak prospects for Japan''s fuel demand, these
refiners aren''t likely to spend large sums of money on upgrades
but will instead downsize plants, Fujisawa said. </p>
<p>Low Ratios </p>
<p>Kosuke Kai, a spokesman for ExxonMobil Yugen Kaisha, which
holds a 50 percent stake in Tonen, said the company is reviewing
the new regulations and declined to comment further. Nelson
Toyomura, a spokesman for Petrobras unit Nansei Sekiyu, said the
company hasn''t determined what to do with its 100,000 barrel-a-
day plant on Okinawa island. </p>
<p>Cosmo Oil spokesman Katsuhisa Maeda said he''s not sure how
the company will deal with the new rules. The Tokyo-based
refiner, 21 percent owned by the government of Abu Dhabi, has
started internal talks to decide how to make its refineries
competitive. </p>
<p>Companies whose ratio of residue refining to crude
distillation is less than 10 percent will need to increase the
proportion by 45 percent by March 2014, according to the new
rules. Nansei Sekiyu, Cosmo Oil and TonenGeneral all fall into
that category, according to Bloomberg calculations based on
refinery data compiled by the Petroleum Association of Japan. </p>
<p>Showa Shell </p>
<p>Showa Shell Sekiyu K.K. will be the least affected among
Japanese refiners as it already has a relatively high ratio of
residue-processing capacity, said Hirofumi Kawachi, a senior
energy analyst at Mizuho Investors Securities Co. in Tokyo. </p>
<p>The company has 88,000 barrels a day residue-processing
capacity compared with 515,000 barrels a day of crude
distillation, a ratio of about 17 percent, according to the
company''s website. That proportion will climb to 22 percent when
the company makes good on plans to shut permanently a 120,000
barrel-a-day crude unit by September 2011. </p>
<p>Refiners with a ratio between 10 percent and 13 percent
need to boost the proportion by 30 percent, and those with more
than 13 percent must increase the ratio by 15 percent, the trade
minister said in its announcement on July 5. </p>
<p>Residue processing facilities such as coker units and
residue fluid catalytic crackers that can produce gasoline and
gasoil components from fuel oil cost around 100 billion yen
($1.1 billion) to build, making them too costly to be viable in
a market where fuel demand is declining, said Yuji Nishiyama, an
analyst at Credit Suisse in Tokyo. </p>
<p>Japan''s domestic demand for fuels is likely to decline at a
rate of 3.5 percent a year through March 2015 because of a
shrinking population and a shift to energy conservation,
according to the trade ministry. </p>
<p>The refiners may have to make more cuts if local demand
falls faster and steeper in the next decade, said Shioda of
Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. was found liable for
not paying the U.K. creators of Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire their share of profits from the quiz show
broadcast on Disney''s ABC network. </p>
<p>A jury in Riverside, California, today awarded $269.4
million in damages to Celador International Ltd. The jurors
agreed that Disney''s Buena Vista Television and ABC breached an
agreement that entitled Celador to 50 percent of the profits
from the show, which first aired in the U.S. in 1999 and helped
lift the network to first place from third in audience ratings. </p>
<p>We believe this verdict is fundamentally wrong and will
aggressively seek to have it reversed, Disney said in an
e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Closely held Celador sued Disney in 2004, claiming Buena
Vista and ABC through a complex web of self-dealing
transactions allowed ABC to keep the advertising revenue and
pay Buena Vista only a licensing fee equal to the cost of
producing the show. That kept Buena Vista from earning a profit
from Millionaire that it would have had to share, Celador
said. </p>
<p>The moral of the story is people should honor their
contracts and treat others fairly, Roman Silberfeld, a lawyer
for Celador, said outside the courtroom. That is what this
jury said today. Even Disney is not immune. </p>
<p>Third-Biggest Verdict </p>
<p>The verdict is the third-largest jury award in the U.S.
this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Major studios have taken a hard line defending lawsuits
over profits and Disney in particular is notorious for its
aggressive legal strategy, said Michael Kump, a partner with
Kinsella Weitzman Iser Kump  Aldisert in Santa Monica,
California, who has litigated cases against Disney. </p>
<p>Studios have been very reluctant to settle these kind of
cases, Kump said in a phone interview. They''re afraid of
setting a precedent and have every profit participant come after
them. </p>
<p>To succeed on appeal, Disney will have to show that the
trial judge erred, possibly in instructing the jurors, Kump
said. Appellate courts generally are reluctant to overturn jury
verdicts, the lawyer said. </p>
<p>Disney, based in Burbank, California, argued that the
creators, who received a flat producers'' fee for each episode,
knew that the network run of Millionaire wouldn''t generate a
profit. There wasn''t anything unusual or secret about the way
Buena Vista and ABC, which took all the financial risks, divided
the rights, said Disney lawyer Martin Katz during the trial. </p>
<p>Iger''s Criticism </p>
<p>Disney Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger said the judge
and the jury got it wrong and should have had more opportunity
to review the contract. </p>
<p>It''s all there in the contract, Iger said today in an
interview at the Allen  Co. media conference in Sun Valley,
Idaho. </p>
<p>The quiz show came on the air in the U.S. in 1999 and its
success prompted ABC to run the program four times a week.
Millionaire was first broadcast in the U.K. in 1998 and has
been carried in 106 countries, including Australia, India,
Japan, Germany and Russia, according to the creators. The show
also was featured in the movie Slumdog Millionaire, which
was co-produced by Celador and which won eight Oscars in 2009. </p>
<p>Eisner E-Mail </p>
<p>Former Disney Chief Executive Officer Michael Eisner said
in a 1999 e-mail introduced by Celador as evidence in the trial
that Who Wants to Be a Millionaire was as important to
Disney''s ABC network as its deal with the National Football
League. </p>
<p>Eisner estimated the value of the rights to the game show
at $1 billion and said it would turn ABC around, according to a
separate 1999 e-mail message forwarded to Disney''s board of
directors. </p>
<p>Celador Chairman Paul Smith said in a phone interview that
the verdict was a great relief and that the company had been
willing to settle the case before it went to trial. </p>
<p>Disney did a fine, fine job producing and exploiting the
show, Smith said. The problem was they exploited it for
their own benefit only. </p>
<p>The case is Celador International Ltd. v. Walt Disney Co.

<p>Hercules Offshore Inc., owner of the
largest fleet of shallow-water drilling rigs in the Gulf of
Mexico, said its Hercules 120 rig began a well for Chevron Corp.
after receiving a federal permit. </p>
<p>Chevron yesterday revoked a June 23 notice that new
drilling rules following a Gulf of Mexico oil spill might cause
it to cancel its contract for the rig under a legal provision
known as force majeure, Houston-based Hercules said today in a
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Drilling began July 2, Hercules said. </p>
<p>President Barack Obama suspended permits to drill in more
than 500 feet (152 meters) of water after the April 20 blowout
of the BP Plc well in the Gulf of Mexico. The administration on
June 8 tightened safety standards for drilling in waters less
than 500 feet deep. The Chevron permit is the 15th under the
revised shallow-water rules and the fourth for a new well,
Hercules General Counsel Jim Noe said. </p>
<p>It''s an encouraging first step, Noe said in an
interview. It''s flow of permits that''s needed, not a trickle.
There are 50 available rigs in the Gulf of Mexico that are
working well-to-well and they continually need permits at a rate
of about 10 to 15 per week, not a handful every couple of
months. </p>
<p>The permit issued to Chevron by the Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management, successor to the regulatory arm of the U.S. Minerals
Management Service, is for a well in water 61 feet deep off
Louisiana, Noe said. </p>
<p>Jack-Up Rigs </p>
<p>Hercules has 30 jack-up rigs, according to its website.
Jack-ups are mobile drilling rigs that extend legs to the ocean
floor in shallow waters. Two others are under contract to
Chevron, one of which is finishing a well in Louisiana state
waters and the other is ready to start a well, Noe said. </p>
<p>Margaret J. Cooper, a spokeswoman for San Ramon,
California-based Chevron, had no immediate comment on the
Hercules filing. </p>
<p>About one in three shallow-water rigs in the Gulf are idle,
double the normal rate, Noe said in an interview last week. </p>
<p>Hercules rose 26 cents, or 11 percent, to $2.54 at 4 p.m.
in Nasdaq trading. It has fallen 42 percent since the BP well
blowout, which caused the largest oil spill in U.S. history. </p>
<p>Chevron rose $1.89, or 2.8 percent, to $69.45 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares are down 9.8
percent this year. </p>

<p>     August, 2010 (Bloomberg Markets) -- Amid a storm of
criticism, government investigations and an SEC suit, the
investment bank''s outside directors have failed to speak out. </p>
<p>Greg Palm, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. general counsel, took a
call in his 37th-floor office at One New York Plaza on Dec. 16,
2008. It was his old boss, Stephen Friedman, a former Goldman
chairman who was then head of the audit committee of its board
of directors. Goldman''s stock was down 65 percent from its 52-
week high during an accelerating global financial breakdown. </p>
<p>Friedman, who had become chairman of the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York that year, told Palm he wanted to buy,
Bloomberg Markets magazine reports in its August issue. </p>
<p>Palm says he couldn''t think of a reason why Friedman
shouldn''t: Goldman had made the necessary disclosures in that
day''s filings, Palm says. </p>
<p>We''d just reported earnings, says Palm, whose job
includes approving trades by directors. There was no material
information that wasn''t public from Goldman''s standpoint. </p>
<p>Friedman, 72, who is still a Goldman director, bought
37,300 shares at an average of $80.78 each on Dec. 17. Five
weeks later, he picked up 15,300 more at an average of $66.61.
By yesterday, the stock had doubled to $133.76, giving Friedman
a paper profit of $3 million. </p>
<p>Now, the U.S. House Oversight and Government Reform
Committee is investigating Friedman''s stock purchases. It wants
to know why he was permitted to buy stock in a bank he was
regulating as chairman of the New York Fed. </p>
<p>Friedman held both that post and his Goldman board seat
when the firm became a bank holding company in September 2008.
The Federal Reserve Act forbids an official at the New York Fed
in his position from also being a director of a bank or buying
its stock. </p>
<p>Perfectly Legal'' </p>
<p>The New York Fed sought a waiver from the Federal Reserve
Board in September 2008 so that Friedman could keep his position
there. Michele Davis, a spokeswoman for Friedman, says New York
Fed general counsel Tom Baxter told Friedman that the rules were
in abeyance while the waiver was pending. </p>
<p>Therefore, Mr. Friedman''s purchases of Goldman Sachs
stock were perfectly legal, she says. The waiver was granted
in January 2009. </p>
<p>Jerry Jordan, a former president of the Cleveland Fed, says
the section of the Federal Reserve Act barring Friedman from
owning bank stock or buying new shares could not be waived. It
was not allowed, he says. You can''t get permission to
violate the law. </p>
<p>Keeping Mum </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s ties to the New York Fed pose another
potential conflict for Friedman, says James Cox, a professor at
Duke University School of Law. Goldman was a prime beneficiary
of the New York Fed-engineered bailout of American International
Group Inc.''s bank counterparties, receiving, by its own count,
$12.9 billion for the credit protection it held on mortgage-
related securities. That figure was not publicly disclosed by
AIG until March 2009 -- after Friedman had bought his shares. </p>
<p>It raises at the least an eyebrow in terms of what he
knew about those payments, Cox says. </p>
<p>New York Fed spokesman Jack Gutt responds: Friedman had
no involvement in nor was he provided with confidential
information related to the New York Fed''s negotiation with any
AIG counterparties. </p>
<p>Friedman resigned from the New York Fed on May 7, 2009,
days after the Wall Street Journal reported his stock buying. At
the time, Baxter said in a statement, It is my view that these
purchases did not violate any Federal Reserve statute, rule or
policy. </p>
<p>As the Friedman saga unfolds -- and Goldman''s regulatory
and legal entanglements escalate -- the firm''s nine outside
directors, who aren''t Goldman employees, are keeping mum. </p>
<p>Completely Unfounded'' </p>
<p>The board members said nothing publicly, for instance,
when on April 16 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
filed a civil suit alleging Goldman had committed fraud in
underwriting and marketing a mortgage-related security called
Abacus 2007-AC1 without disclosing to clients that a bearish
hedge fund customer, Paulson  Co., was involved in creating it. </p>
<p>Goldman calls the SEC suit completely unfounded. </p>
<p>Federal prosecutors in New York are also investigating
Goldman transactions to determine whether to pursue a criminal
fraud case, according to two people familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>Nell Minow, co-founder of the Portland, Maine-based
Corporate Library, a governance research firm, says that when
the SEC suit was filed, the outside directors should have
immediately set up a committee to investigate, hired independent
counsel and announced that they would make the results of their
probe public. </p>
<p>Wells Notice </p>
<p>The board should also have been riding herd on its members''
stock trades, says Cornell University Law School Professor
Robert Hockett, who specializes in financial regulation from his
office in Ithaca, New York. Goldman spokesman Lucas van Praag
says directors are periodically informed of such trades. The
bank received a Wells notice dated July 28, 2009, notifying the
firm that it was the target of an SEC fraud investigation. </p>
<p>At least three company executives, including Vice Chairman
Michael Evans, unloaded more than $27 million of Goldman stock
from October 2009 through February 2010 in open market sales
unrelated to the recent exercise of options or delivery of
restricted stock, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Van Praag says Goldman''s board was informed of the Wells
notice, which was not made public until after the SEC filed its
suit. He says the firm''s lawyers determined it wasn''t material. </p>
<p>On the face of it, the idea that that would not be
material -- I can''t imagine anybody saying that with a straight
face, Hockett says. </p>
<p>11-Hour Hearing </p>
<p>Jacob Zamansky of Zamansky  Associates LLC filed a class-
action lawsuit on April 30 on behalf of Goldman shareholders,
saying that Goldman made false statements relating to the SEC
suit and failed to disclose adverse facts about the company to
shareholders. </p>
<p>The Wells notice was a material fact going to the heart
of their business, he says. Goldman had not formally responded
to the suit as of late June. </p>
<p>The number of issues Goldman executives, and their board,
need to address continues to build. </p>
<p>Director Rajat Gupta did not stand for re-election to the
board in May. U.S. investigators suspect him of leaking word of
a $5 billion investment in Goldman by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. in
2008, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>Gary Naftalis, a lawyer for Gupta, former worldwide
managing director of McKinsey  Co., says, Rajat Gupta has
never violated any law or rule. </p>
<p>A Billion Pages </p>
<p>On April 27, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations held an 11-hour hearing on Goldman''s role in the
financial meltdown. </p>
<p>Goldman repeatedly put its own interests and profits
ahead of the interests of its clients and our communities,
Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, said at the hearing. </p>
<p>We respectfully disagree, van Praag says. </p>
<p>On June 7, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission
subpoenaed Goldman, accusing it of attempting to hinder its
probe of the firm by electronically sending it the equivalent of
more than a billion pages of documents. Yesterday the leaders of
the commission told journalists in a conference call that the
firm has become more responsive. </p>
<p>The outside directors haven''t been visible on any of
this, says Patrick McGurn, special counsel at RiskMetrics
Group, a New York adviser to shareholders. You have to ask if
it''s setting the correct ethical tone. </p>
<p>Van Praag says: Board chairman Lloyd Blankfein has made
the views of the board well-known. </p>
<p>Speaking Out </p>
<p>Goldman''s board consists of two insiders, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Blankfein and President Gary Cohn, and
nine outsiders. There are five scheduled meetings per year and
more as needed, the company says. </p>
<p>The outside directors are: Friedman; Lois Juliber, 61,
former vice chairman of Colgate-Palmolive Co.; William George,
67, ex-CEO of Medtronic Inc.; Lakshmi Mittal, 60, CEO of
steelmaker ArcelorMittal; John Bryan, 73, ex-CEO of Sara Lee
Corp.; Lee Scott, 61, ex-CEO of Wal-Mart Stores Inc.; Claes Dahlback, 63, ex-CEO of Sweden''s Investor AB; James Johnson, 66,
vice chairman of merchant bank Perseus LLC and former CEO of
Fannie Mae; and James Schiro, 64, former head of insurer Zurich
Financial Services AG. </p>
<p>Directors who completed a full year in 2009 were paid an
average of $460,852 in stock and options compared with $255,519
in cash and stock for JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s 10 outside
directors and $337,803 for Morgan Stanley''s 11 outsiders,
proxies show. </p>
<p>Goldman''s board may have been able to preempt criticism of
the company by speaking out, says Sean Coffey, a former partner
at Bernstein Litowitz Berger  Grossmann LLP, who''s running for
New York state attorney general. </p>
<p>Shopping at Walmart </p>
<p>The board should have established a committee of outside
directors with an independent counsel to investigate ethics
matters and get the facts, says Coffey, who won more than $50
million from WorldCom Inc. directors in a 2005 settlement with
the telecom company. </p>
<p>The right decision might be to take out advertisements
and apologize or it might be to batten down the hatches,
Coffey says. Don''t omit disclosing material information that
investors ought to know. </p>
<p>Minow says the Goldman board should have nominated someone
who had securities law enforcement experience, who could have
led an internal investigation. </p>
<p>Instead, in March, Goldman nominated -- and shareholders
later approved -- the appointment of Walmart''s Scott. After an
exchange in which a person at the May 7 annual meeting asked how
Scott had been selected, CEO Blankfein deadpanned, Actually, I
like shopping at Walmart. </p>
<p>Nine-Person Board </p>
<p>At the meeting, Goldman announced the creation of an
internal committee that will examine possible conflicts of
interest and other issues such as transparency and disclosure.
It''s headed by Vice Chairman Evans and E. Gerald Corrigan,
chairman of Goldman Sachs Bank USA. No board members are
involved. </p>
<p>Former EBay CEO Meg Whitman, who joined Goldman''s board in
2001, says then-CEO Henry Paulson brushed aside her questions to
move a meeting along. </p>
<p>They wanted to keep acting like a group of partners who
did much of their discussion and decision-making in private and
then expected to get the board''s rubber stamp, Whitman writes
in her new book, The Power of Many (Crown, 2010). She resigned
after 15 months. </p>
<p>Whitman is now the Republican candidate for governor of
California. </p>
<p>Cornell''s Hockett says that if Friedman violated any laws,
the entire Goldman board is to blame. </p>
<p>Boards are intended to police the actions of their
members, he says. </p>
<p>Class C </p>
<p>Friedman spokesperson Davis says the waiver exonerates him. </p>
<p>The New York Fed''s nine-person board consists of three
classes of directors serving staggered terms. Class A directors
are elected by member banks to represent commercial banks; one
class A director today is JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. Class B directors are elected by member banks to
represent the public, while class C directors such as Friedman,
who also represent the public, are appointed by the Fed Board of
Governors. </p>
<p>Former Cleveland Fed President Jordan says the law is
clear: As a Class C director, Friedman could not own, much less
buy, bank stock. </p>
<p>Section 4, Number 15 of the Federal Reserve Act reads, No
director of class C shall be an officer, director, employee, or
stockholder of any bank. </p>
<p>The New York Fed argued that because Goldman was a bank
holding company and not a bank, a waiver could be granted,
according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The Fed
agreed. </p>
<p>Shares Surge </p>
<p>How much the Goldman board''s silence in the face of
adversity has cost the firm is difficult to gauge. Goldman
shares have surged 157 percent as of June 29 since hitting an
all-time low in November 2008. In May, shareholders approved
those directors standing for election by margins of more than 95
percent or greater. </p>
<p>Still, says Coffey, the board''s somnolence in the face of
so much controversy has done nothing to support Goldman''s
storied franchise. </p>

<p>(Corrects fourth paragraph to say Burkle and Weinsteins are
considering a bid.) </p>
<p>Construction executive Ronald Tutor
is in discussions to buy Walt Disney Co.''s Miramax film
division, with backing from private equity firm Colony Capital,
according to two people with knowledge of the talks. </p>
<p>Negotiations are continuing almost around the clock, said
one of the people, who asked not to be named because the talks
are private. If consummated, an agreement could be announced by
next week, the person said. </p>
<p>Tutor approached Colony prior to the July 4 weekend seeking
financing, said one person with knowledge of the arrangement.
Los Angeles-based Colony, led by chairman and CEO Tom Barrack,
has investments that include Michael Jackson''s Neverland ranch
in Santa Barbara. </p>
<p>Los Angeles investor Ron Burkle and Miramax founders Harvey
and Bob Weinstein, who were working on a $625 million offer, are
weighing whether to put in a competing bid, said two other
people with knowledge of the situation. They had ended talks
with Disney in May. </p>
<p>The Weinsteins sold Miramax to Disney in 1993. The two, who
left in 2005, control rights to some films and are acquainted
with both Tutor and Barrack, according to one of the people. </p>
<p>Disney is seeking $600 million to $700 million for Miramax,
producer of The English Patient and Shakespeare in Love,
said one of the people. </p>
<p>Tutor, chairman and chief executive of Sylmar, California-
based Tutor Perini Corp., didn''t return calls seeking comment.
Disney spokeswoman Zenia Mucha declined to comment on the talks. </p>
<p>Lead Negotiators </p>
<p>Harvey Weinstein, in Sun Valley, Idaho, for media banker
Allen  Co.''s annual conference, declined to discuss Miramax
yesterday. </p>
<p>I think it''s better for me to not say anything,
Weinstein said in an interview. </p>
<p>Leading negotiations for Colony is Richard Nanula, who was
chief financial officer at Disney when it purchased Miramax,
said the person. Nanula is negotiating with Kevin Mayer,
Disney''s executive vice president for corporate strategy. </p>
<p>The talks were reported yesterday by the Web site
Deadline.com/Hollywood and by Reuters. </p>
<p>Disney gained 20 cents to $33.34 at 4 p.m. in New York

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest
publicly traded company, plans to buy back $3 billion of its
shares this quarter, easing the effect on shareholders from its
takeover of natural-gas producer XTO Energy Inc., and said it
will pay off or refinance the deal''s assumed debt. </p>
<p>The $25 billion purchase last month increased outstanding
shares at Irving, Texas-based Exxon Mobil, by 416 million, or
about 9 percent, David Rosenthal, vice president for investor
relations, said today during a conference call with analysts.
The company also will pay off or refinance $11 billion of
assumed debt when the opportunity presents, he said. </p>
<p>The deal made Exxon Mobil the largest U.S. producer of
clean-burning gas, which Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson
expects to be the fastest-growing fuel for more than two
decades. He kept almost all of XTO''s 3,300 employees and said a
team in its former Fort Worth headquarters will spend up to 18
months setting drilling priorities. </p>
<p>Now that we''ve got this in-house, we want to look at what
are the optimization steps that could be taken, Tillerson said
on the call. We don''t have to be driven by all the aspects
that XTO standalone was. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil is ending XTO''s practice of locking in oil and
gas prices for future production and instead will use its
traditional yardstick of return on capital, Tillerson said. At
the same time, XTO was more efficient than Exxon Mobil at
drilling onshore wells such as those in the Permian Basin of
West Texas, Tillerson said. </p>
<p>Unconventional Bet </p>
<p>The XTO purchase is a long-term bet that gas from shale
formations, coal seams and other so-called unconventional
sources will meet rising U.S. demand through at least 2030 as
output from conventional wells declines, Tillerson said. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil acquired the equivalent of at least 45 trillion
cubic feet of recoverable gas beneath 3.34 million U.S. acres
with the purchase, along with expertise to evaluate 4.8 million
acres of potential fields already accumulated outside the U.S.,
Tillerson said. </p>
<p>The unconventional assets include oil and gas trapped in
dense, hard rock such as shale, considered not worth drilling
until Texas oil-patch billionaire George Mitchell developed
methods to extract gas economically in the 1990s. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil rose 38 cents to $58.81 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have fallen 14
percent this year. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan
Stanley profit estimates were lowered by Meredith Whitney
Advisory Group LLC, following similar cuts by other research
analysts as markets fell and business demand shriveled. </p>
<p>Whitney cut her estimate for Goldman Sachs''s second-quarter
earnings per share to $1.70 from an earlier forecast of $4.75
and reduced her estimate for Morgan Stanley to 40 cents from 68
cents, according to a report from her New York-based firm. </p>
<p>Estimates for earnings have tumbled during recent weeks as
stock markets dropped amid a return of risk aversion by
investors. Analysts including Douglas Sipkin at Ticonderoga
Securities and Guy Moszkowski at Bank of America Corp. have
slashed earnings forecasts because of a lower revenue outlook
and higher costs related to legal expenses and a U.K. bonus tax. </p>
<p>Whitney''s cuts are due to a heinous trading environment
and lower than anticipated investment-banking activity, she
said in the July 7 note to investors. </p>
<p>The second quarter was the worst quarter for debt and
equity underwriting volume in over a year as volatility spiked,
and global equity indices recorded the steepest quarterly
declines since the fourth quarter 2008, she wrote. </p>
<p>The average estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
is for New York-based Goldman Sachs to earn $2.30 per share in
the second quarter, with forecasts of $1.60 per share to $3.21
per share. Goldman Sachs earned $5.59 per share in the first
quarter of 2010 and $4.93 per share in the second quarter of
2009. </p>
<p>Full-Year Estimates </p>
<p>Whitney also lowered her estimates for Goldman Sachs''s
third and fourth-quarter earnings to $3.77 and $4.64 from $4.24
and $5.42, respectively. She expects the firm to earn $15.70 in
2010, down from an earlier estimate of $20 a share, while the
2011 forecast was reduced to $19.50 from $22. </p>
<p>The average estimate of 11 analysts is for Morgan Stanley
to earn 48 cents, with a range of 39 cents to 58 cents. Last
quarter the New York-based firm earned 82 cents a share, while
it lost $1.37 a share a year earlier. Whitney cut her full-year
2010 estimate to $2.62 per share from $2.90 and lowered the 2011
estimate to $3 from $3.05. </p>
<p>Whitney has a neutral rating on both Goldman Sachs and
Morgan Stanley stock. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. was found liable for
not paying the U.K. creators of Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire their share of profits from the quiz show
broadcast on Disney''s ABC network. </p>
<p>A federal court jury in Riverside, California, yesterday
awarded $269.4 million in damages to Celador International Ltd.
The jurors agreed that Disney''s Buena Vista Television and ABC
breached an agreement that entitled Celador to 50 percent of the
profits from the show, which first aired in the U.S. in 1999 and
helped lift the network to first place from third in audience
ratings. </p>
<p>We believe this verdict is fundamentally wrong and will
aggressively seek to have it reversed, Disney said in an e-
mailed statement. </p>
<p>Closely held Celador sued Disney in 2004, claiming Buena
Vista and ABC through a complex web of self-dealing
transactions allowed ABC to keep the advertising revenue and
pay Buena Vista only a licensing fee equal to the cost of
producing the show. That kept Buena Vista from earning a profit
from Millionaire that it would have had to share, Celador
said. </p>
<p>Disney, based in Burbank, California, argued that the
creators, who received a flat producers'' fee for each episode,
knew that the network run of Millionaire wouldn''t generate a
profit. There wasn''t anything unusual or secret about the way
Buena Vista and ABC, which took all the financial risks, divided
the rights, said Disney lawyer Martin Katz during the trial. </p>

<p>Trials/Appeals </p>
<p>Two Former Marsh Executives'' Convictions Tossed in Bid-Rig Case </p>
<p>A New York judge threw out the criminal convictions against
two former Marsh  McLennan Cos. executives whom he found guilty
of restraint of trade in 2008. </p>
<p>State Supreme Court Justice James Yates in Manhattan tossed
the convictions against William Gilman and Edward McNenney,
former managing directors at Marsh, in a July 2 written
decision. The pair were accused of fixing prices to steer
business to insurers that paid Marsh hidden fees from November
1998 to September 2004. </p>
<p>The decision was the latest loss for the New York Attorney
General''s office in its six-year probe of anti-competitive sales
practices in the insurance industry. The case, begun under
former state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, was tried under his
successor, Andrew Cuomo. </p>
<p>Failures by prosecutors, including newly discovered
contradictory evidence, undermines the court''s confidence in the
verdict, Yates wrote in his decision. </p>
<p>Yates found the two men guilty in February 2008 of a single
count of restraint of trade under New York''s antitrust statutes
after a 10-month trial. </p>
<p>We are reviewing the decision and contemplating an
appeal, Richard Bamberger, a spokesman for Cuomo, said in an
e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>The attorney general''s office, following a 2004 probe,
alleged that McNenney, Gilman and six other Marsh Global Broking
Inc. brokers took part in a conspiracy to fraudulently obtain
millions of dollars for Marsh and its accomplice companies by
rigging the market for excess casualty insurance, according to a
redacted copy of the 25-page decision. </p>
<p>Gilman, formerly Marsh''s executive marketing director and
managing director, and McNenney, the former global placement
director and managing director, worked in the Excess Casualty
Unit of Marsh Global Broking, a Marsh Inc. unit. </p>
<p>In January, Yates allowed former Marsh employees Robert
Stearns and Kathryn Winter and former Zurich Financial Services
AG employee James Spiegel to withdraw their guilty pleas to
felony charges of participating in a scheme to defraud. The
judge agreed to reduce the charges to misdemeanors and said he
would dismiss the charges if the three abided by plea
agreements. Yates also dismissed charges against six people who
previously pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges related to
alleged bid-rigging. </p>

<p>Stanford Professor Stung by Fund Wins $2.2 Million From Bank </p>
<p>A First Republic Bank unit was ordered to pay a retired
Stanford University professor and his wife $2.18 million after
arbitrators found the firm gave them only a fleeting and
slapdash explanation of a municipal bond fund that imploded
during the credit crisis in 2008. </p>
<p>Eight months after Elliott and Rhoda Levinthal entrusted $3
million to a leveraged investment vehicle called TW Tax
Advantaged Fund LLC, it collapsed, an American Arbitration
Association panel wrote in a July 2 ruling. Evidence shows
workers at First Republic didn''t try to fully grasp risks in the
fund they designed, the panel found. The firm also inadequately
trained a saleswoman who dealt with the Levinthals, and didn''t
ensure they understood the investment. </p>
<p>The education offered to the Levinthals was fleeting and
slapdash, arbitrators wrote. An investment in a highly
complex and concededly risky product like the fund, sold in this
fashion, is by definition unsuitable for someone with their
experience and objectives. </p>
<p>Greg Berardi, a spokesman for the San Francisco-based
company, declined to comment. Bank of America Corp. acquired
First Republic Bank while buying Merrill Lynch  Co. last year,
and sold it last week to an investor group that included founder
James H. Herbert II. </p>
<p>Elliott Levinthal, 88, is a professor emeritus of
mechanical engineering at Stanford. He and his wife endowed
Levinthal Hall, a lecture hall at the Stanford Humanities
Center. </p>
<p>The panel ordered First Republic Securities to pay the
couple and their trust $2.1 million in compensatory damages,
plus $78,153 in fees and expenses. </p>
<p>About 35 retail mutual funds marketed as leveraged
municipal arbitrage strategies have failed in recent years, said
Craig McCann of the Securities and Litigation Consulting Group
Inc., a Virginia consulting firm that testified for the
Levinthals in the arbitration. Brokerage firms sold the funds as
higher-yielding alternatives to conventional municipal bond
portfolios with little, if any risk, he said in a 2009 report. </p>
<p>Skilled Healthcare Falls After $671 Million Verdict </p>
<p>Skilled Healthcare Group Inc. plunged the most since its

<p>Skilled Healthcare dropped $4.70, or 76 percent, to $1.52
yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, the largest intraday
decline since the shares went on sale in May 2007. They peaked
in August 2008 at $17.17. </p>
<p>The plaintiffs accused Skilled Healthcare of improperly
staffing 22 California facilities. A Humboldt County jury July 6
found the company liable for $613 million in statutory damages,
the maximum allowed by state law, and $58 million for
restitution. Skilled Healthcare, based in Foothill Ranch,
California, said yesterday it will appeal. </p>
<p>We strongly disagree with the outcome of this legal
matter and we intend to vigorously challenge it, Chief
Executive Officer Boyd Hendrickson said in a statement. The
company believes our facilities are appropriately staffed,
he said. </p>
<p>The verdict is the largest jury award in the U.S. this
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Skilled
Healthcare said the award exceeds the policy limits of its
insurance. The jury will return later to determine punitive
damages, said the company, which posted a net loss of $133
million last year on revenue of $759.8 million. </p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed in 2006 on behalf of current and
former residents of 22 Skilled Healthcare operations in
California, plaintiffs'' attorney Tim Needham said. California
law requires nursing homes to maintain staff at a rate of 3.2
nursing hours per patient per day, he said. </p>

<p>Gulf Drilling Ban Should Be Restored, U.S. Argues </p>
<p>A three-judge appeals panel will hear arguments from the
U.S. government today on whether a six-month moratorium on deep-
water drilling in the Gulf of Mexico should be reinstated after
a lower court judge threw out the ban. </p>
<p>The government is seeking to delay an order by U.S.
District Judge Martin Feldman that scrapped the six-month
drilling moratorium, imposed May 27 after the explosion and
sinking of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in April. </p>
<p>Feldman''s June 22 ruling came in a lawsuit against U.S.
regulators by oil service companies claiming the drilling
suspension would cause them irreparable economic harm. The ban''s
potential economic impact is outweighed by the risk of another
spill, lawyers for the Interior Department argued in court
papers filed before a hearing set for this afternoon in New
Orleans. </p>
<p>If in Interior''s judgment, drilling poses a threat of
serious or irreparable environmental harm, the public interest
in avoiding that threat would trump economic considerations in
the short term, the government said in a July 6 filing. </p>
<p>The Interior Department asked the appeals court to stay
Feldman''s order and keep the moratorium in place long enough for
regulators to appeal. </p>
<p>Hornbeck Offshore Services Inc. and more than a dozen other
offshore service and supply companies sued U.S. regulators,
including Interior Secretary Kenneth Salazar, last month,
seeking to block the moratorium. </p>
<p>The case is Hornbeck Offshore Services LLC v. Salazar,
2:10-cv-01663, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Louisiana (New Orleans). The appeal case is 10-30585, 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals (New Orleans). </p>
<p>New Suits </p>
<p>HSBC Sued for Fraud Over Credit-Card Protection Plan </p>
<p>Units of HSBC Holdings Plc, Europe''s biggest lender by
market value, were sued by U.S. customers who said the bank''s
credit-card payment-protection service defrauds disabled,
retired and unemployed consumers. </p>
<p>While the service purports to safeguard accounts by
suspending or canceling required minimum payments when customers
become disabled or unemployed, the circumstances that trigger
protection are varied, complicated and always changing,
according to complaints filed July 2 against HSBC units in
federal courts in Philadelphia and Camden, New Jersey. </p>
<p>The bank enrolls people before sending them restrictions in
small print that are incomplete, indecipherable, misleading
and obfuscatory, the complaints said. The plan, which costs
$1.35 per $100 of a month-ending credit-card balance, excludes
the self-employed, part-time workers, retired people and those
who are already unemployed or on disability, the customers said. </p>
<p>Kate Durham, a spokeswoman for London-based HSBC, said the
bank doesn''t comment on legal matters. </p>
<p>The payment protection device is designed to prey on the
financially insecure and is virtually worthless because of the
numerous restrictions that are imposed, according to the
complaints. </p>
<p>The Camden complaint, brought by Marilyn Rizera, said HSBC
Bank USA Inc. and HSBC Card Services Inc. are violating the New
Jersey Consumer Fraud Act and engaged in breach of contract. The
Philadelphia case, by Edward T. Esslinger, Gloria Glover and
Adrath Rogers, said the bank is violating the Pennsylvania
Unfair Practices and Consumer Protection Law.Both seek to
proceed as group, or class-action, lawsuits. </p>
<p>Payment Protection is so confusing as to when coverage is
triggered, so restricted in terms of the benefits it provides to
subscribers, and processing claims is made so difficult by HSBC,
that the product is essentially worthless, according to
Rizera''s complaint. </p>
<p>The cases are Rizera v. HSBC Bank USA Inc., 10-cv-3375,
U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey (Camden); and
Esslinger v. HSBC Bank Services, 10-cv-3213, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia). </p>
<p>Carlyle Group Sued by Mortgage Bond Fund Liquidator over Losses </p>
<p>Carlyle Group, the world''s second-largest private-equity
firm, was sued by liquidators of the buyout firm''s defunct
mortgage bond fund, saying executives lost $945 million in
overly risky investments. </p>
<p>Liquidators for Carlyle Capital Corp. Ltd, a Guernsey,
Channel Islands-based hedge fund that collapsed in March 2008,
contend Carlyle directors turned a blind eye to questionable
investments in residential mortgage-backed securities and failed
to stop the loss of all the company''s capital, according to a
lawsuit filed in Delaware. </p>
<p>In the short space of eight months, the entirety of CCC''s
capital was spectacularly lost under the reckless and grossly
negligent direction, supervision, management and advice of the
defendants, the liquidators said in the suit, filed yesterday
in Delaware Chancery Court. </p>
<p>Lenders seized Carlyle Capital''s assets after it failed to
meet more than $400 million of margin calls on mortgage-backed
collateral that had plunged in value. Carlyle Group, co-founded
by David Rubenstein, wound up the fund seven months after its
initial public offering. </p>
<p>Carlyle Group officials said they''d defend themselves in
court over the fund liquidators'' claims. The liquidators also
filed suit over the investment losses in state court in
Manhattan yesterday. </p>
<p>We will vigorously contest all claims and are confident
we will prevail, Chris Ullman, a company spokesman, said. </p>
<p>Carlyle Capital raised $945 million in equity funding and
sought to generate annual returns of at least 12 percent by
investing in residential mortgage backed securities and
leveraged finance assets, the liquidators'' lawyers said in
the suit. </p>
<p>The company''s business model called for leverage equaling
19 times capital, the complaint said, adding that the actual
leverage employed exceeded 30 times capital. </p>
<p>Mortgage securities were among the biggest contributors to
writedowns and credit losses of almost $1.8 trillion since the
start of 2007 at the world''s largest banks, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The case is Carlyle Capital Corp. Ltd. v. William Elias
Conway Jr., CA5625, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). </p>
<p>Firearms Sellers, CME Trader Sue Chicago Over Gun-Control Law </p>
<p>A Chicago Mercantile Exchange trader and three other people
have joined with the Illinois Association of Firearms Retailers
to sue the city of Chicago over a restrictive gun law passed by
its legislators last week. </p>
<p>The gun-owning plaintiffs, who include a teacher''s aide and
a married couple, claim the new ordinance restricting handgun
possession to inside the home and mandating firearms training
and permitting is unconstitutional. </p>
<p>The measure imposes new restrictions that have the
purpose and effect of preventing plaintiffs and other law-
abiding residents of Chicago from exercising their fundamental
right to keep and carry firearms for self defense and other
lawful purposes, the plaintiffs said in a complaint filed July
6 in the city''s federal courthouse. </p>
<p>Ruling in a case challenging Chicago''s earlier ban on
handgun possession, a divided U.S. Supreme Court on June 28 said
the constitutional right to bear arms binds states and
municipalities. </p>
<p>Chicago''s new law was passed by the city council 45-0 four
days later. Jennifer Hoyle, a spokeswoman for the city''s law
department, said in an e-mailed message that the office had just
received a copy of the complaint and is reviewing it. She said
she couldn''t otherwise immediately comment. The high court
decision effectively overturned the city''s handgun ban,
Mayor Richard M. Daley said in a July 2 press statement
announcing the new ordinance. He is a named defendant in the
lawsuit. </p>
<p>The retailer''s association, based in Carbondale, Illinois,
claims it has members who want to sell guns and operate firing
ranges within the city, yet can''t because of the law. </p>
<p>The plaintiffs seek a court order declaring the
restrictions unconstitutional. </p>
<p>The case is Benson v. City of Chicago, 10cv4184, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago). </p>

<p>With the millions he made peddling
fake Viagra, Martin Hickman bought a beachside villa on Spain''s
Costa del Sol, a diamond-studded Rolex and a flat in London.
Pfizer Inc. aims to make sure he never gets to enjoy them. </p>
<p>The spoils of Hickman''s crimes helped settle a trademark
infringement lawsuit brought by the world''s largest drugmaker
three years ago. It''s the biggest example of a new approach
Pfizer is taking to fight counterfeiting of prescription drugs,
an industry that''s almost doubled to $75 billion in five years,
according to the New York-based Center for Medicine in the
Public Interest. </p>
<p>Pfizer, whose erectile dysfunction pill Viagra is one of
the most copied medicines, once relied on local authorities and
criminal courts to hunt down offenders. Now it''s hired former
U.S. customs officials, FBI agents, Turkish narcotics experts
and Hong Kong police to find counterfeiters. In China, they''re
tracking fakes to the source, raiding derelict warehouses for
evidence of illegal drug-making. In the U.K., they''re using
civil courts to hit fake pill peddlers where it hurts most. </p>
<p>The point is to make them realize that there''s no sense
from a business perspective in counterfeiting our products,
because if we find you, we''re taking your money away, says
John P. Clark, a 55-year-old U.S. law enforcement veteran who
now serves as New York-based Pfizer''s chief security officer. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. and OAO Rosneft''s plan
to drill for oil in the Russian Black Sea hinge on a request for
government tax breaks, according to a copy of their initial
drilling agreement obtained by Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>The final agreement is conditional on the group gaining
assurances of fiscal relief from the Russian government to
ensure the economic viability of the project, according to the
document. The two sides aim to finish negotiations by the end of
March and start drilling at the end of next year. Chevron will
have a 33.3 percent stake in the venture. </p>
<p>Russia needs foreign capital and technology to tap harder-
to-drill deposits as production from existing fields in Siberia
declines. The deal would mark Chevron''s second attempt at
Russian offshore drilling after the state annulled a production
sharing agreement to develop a block of the coast of Sakhalin
Island in 2004. </p>
<p>Russia is looking for foreign direct investment in
frontier areas where Russians do not have the expertise to
explore and develop themselves, Ed Chow, a senior fellow at
the Center for Strategic International Studies and a former
Chevron executive, said by e-mail. There are oil companies
willing to test the investment climate in spite of Russia''s
dubious track record. </p>
<p>Tax Exemptions </p>
<p>The state last year approved exemptions from mineral
extraction tax for the first 20 million metric tons of oil
produced from Black Sea deposits. Even so, Chevron Chief
Executive John Watson said the venture would seek tax breaks for
the project in a meeting with Prime Minister Vladimir Putin
during the signing of the agreement. </p>
<p>Ideally, fiscal relief should come from a change in the
tax laws applying to new exploration and production projects,
Alexei Kokin, an oil and gas analyst at AFK Metropol, said by e-
mail today. </p>
<p>A deal would also mark Chevron''s initial foray into the
little-explored Black Sea after rival Exxon Mobil Corp. has
snapped up acreage in Turkey and Romania as have Petroleo
Brasileiro SA, OAO Lukoil and Vanco Energy. </p>
<p>Chevron will provide all financing, up to $1 billion, in
the venture''s exploration phase which would include drilling two
exploration wells and two appraisal wells on one discovery, the
document said, adding that Chevron will pay a Rosneft bonus in
the event of a discovery. </p>
<p>Venture Structure </p>
<p>The group will seek to structure the venture to allow
Chevron to book reserves, according to U.S. Securities Exchange
Commission requirements even though Rosneft will retain complete
ownership of the licenses to the venture''s West Chernomorsky
block, the agreement said. </p>
<p>Rosneft has identified 5 potential structures in the
deepwater block and potential resources of 860 million tons of
oil, according to the company website. </p>
<p>Drilling on the block is expected to begin at the end of
next year, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin said last
month at the time of the signing. The two companies will first
have to find a way to close negotiations which have been going
on since at least 2008. </p>
<p>Both Rosneft and Chevron declined to comment on ongoing
commercial negotiations. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was accused
in a lawsuit by Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. of misleading
investors in 2007 when it sold Fannie Mae preferred shares while
betting against the U.S. mortgage market. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs misrepresented Fannie Mae''s health when it
underwrote the offerings, in which the insurer invested
$62.5 million, according to a complaint filed yesterday in
federal court in Boston. The investment bank misstated the
purpose of the sale by saying the offering was to raise surplus
capital when it was actually needed to help Fannie Mae sustain
its business, said Liberty Mutual, which accused Goldman Sachs
of securities fraud. </p>
<p>As a knowledgeable and sophisticated investor in the U.S.
real estate financial markets, and with access to Fannie Mae''s
financial records, Goldman Sachs knew or recklessly disregarded
the actual status of Fannie Mae''s capital structure, Liberty
Mutual said in the complaint. The mortgage guarantor was seized
by the U.S. in 2008. </p>
<p>Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, said the suit was without merit and we will contest it
vigorously. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs has come under fire from Congress and
regulators for its underwriting and investments as mortgage
markets collapsed during the credit crisis. The U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission sued Goldman Sachs in April, claiming it
sold a collateralized debt obligation without disclosing that a
hedge fund helped pick underlying securities and bet against the
vehicles. Goldman Sachs has denied wrongdoing. </p>
<p>Senate Probe </p>
<p>At the time that it was underwriting the Fannie Mae
offering, Goldman was aware that there were significant
problems in the real estate market and bet its own money
against subprime-mortgage-related securities, Liberty Mutual
said in the complaint, which drew on documents collected by the
U.S. Senate''s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. </p>
<p>The documents, including internal Goldman Sachs e-mails,
establish that during the time leading up to the disputed
offerings, Goldman Sachs not only knew about the serious risks
in the mortgage market, but it was urgently moving to short the
mortgage market, the suit says. </p>
<p>Managing Risk </p>
<p>The offerings raised almost $8 billion and were completed
in September and December of 2007, according to the complaint.
Fannie Mae fell into U.S. conservatorship the following
September, leaving Liberty''s investment virtually worthless,
the suit says. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein
told the Senate panel in April that his firm is a market-maker,
a role that often puts the company on the opposite side of
customers as it tries to manage its own risk. </p>
<p>We didn''t have a massive short against the housing market
and we certainly did not bet against our clients, Blankfein
said. </p>
<p>Rich Angevine, a spokesman for Liberty Mutual, declined to
comment. The Boston-based company is owned by policyholders and
isn''t publicly traded. Goldman Sachs advanced $2.26, or
1.7 percent, to $137.72 at 12:05 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. The stock has dropped 18 percent this year. </p>
<p>Liberty Mutual slashed its stake in Goldman Sachs by
80 percent in the six months ended March 31, 2009. That was part
of more than two years of stock sales that brought the insurer''s
stake in Goldman Sachs to 7,752 shares at the end of the first
quarter from 46,343 shares in September 2007. </p>
<p>Liberty Mutual dumped bank stocks after the 2008 financial
crisis, Chief Executive Officer Edmund Ted Kelly said in a
March 2009 conference call with policyholders and bond
investors. Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo
 Co. were among the financial firms sold in late 2008,
according to regulatory filings. </p>
<p>The case is Liberty Mutual v. Goldman Sachs, 10-cv-11150,
U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts (Boston). </p>

<p>Zinc will be 12 percent less than previously estimated at
$1,981 a metric ton, and coking coal will be 10 percent lower at
$199 a ton, the bank said in a report dated yesterday. The 2010

<p>General Growth is seeking court permission to use the new

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup
Inc., Morgan Stanley and dozens more bank and brokerages were
sued by a Boston area-based fund seeking reimbursement for
losses related to subprime loans. </p>
<p>Cambridge Place Investment Management Inc., founded by ex-
Goldman Sachs Group bankers Martin Finegold and Robert Kramer,
lost more than $1.2 billion as a result of the banks'' untrue
statements, according to a copy of the complaint filed July 9 in
state court in Massachusetts. </p>
<p>The banks sold securities backed by mortgages that came
from a small group of now notorious subprime mortgage
originators, used faulty appraisals, accepted misleading
information in loan applications, and violated their own
standards for underwriting, the firm said in the lawsuit. The
banks offered or sold $2.4 billion of residential mortgage-
backed securities using untrue statements, according to the
lawsuit. </p>
<p>The Wall Street banks conducted inadequate due diligence
and failed to satisfy their own responsibilities, Cambridge
Place said in the lawsuit. </p>
<p>The bundling of the riskiest type of mortgages into
securities played a role in turning the U.S. housing slump into
a global recession as foreclosures deflated bond values and
toppled Wall Street firms including Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. </p>
<p>Improper Lending'' </p>
<p>The banks created an environment of improper lending
practices, keeping personnel on site at the mortgage lenders
to monitor the loan underwriting business, according to the
lawsuit. </p>
<p>The suit also names Bank of America Corp., Merrill Lynch 
Co., UBS AG, JPMorgan Chase  Co., Barclays PLC, Credit Suisse
Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings PLC and dozens of
others. </p>
<p>Representatives from Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan,
Barclays, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank
declined to comment on the lawsuit. Representatives from the
others couldn''t be reached after business hours. </p>
<p>Bank representatives who allegedly offered or sold
securities to Cambridge Place included Scott Eichel, RBS
Securities Inc.''s co-head of its mortgage and asset backed
securities business, when he had been at Bear Stearns Cos., and
Greg Lippman, who helped create the market for betting against
subprime mortgage bonds in 2005 and then profited along with
hedge funds when home prices declined and defaults soared to
records two years later. </p>
<p>Eichel, Lippman </p>
<p>Eichel didn''t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment after regular business hours. A voice message left for
Lippman after business hours wasn''t returned. </p>
<p>The filing wasn''t immediately available on the court''s
electronic docket and was provided by an attorney for Concord,
Massachusetts-based Cambridge Place Investment Management. </p>

Place Investment Management Inc. v. Morgan Stanley, 10-2741,
Massachusetts Superior Court, Suffolk County (Boston). </p>

<p>China''s first narrow-body jet may
take a technological leap with a contract awarded to a joint
venture between General Electric Co. and state-owned Aviation
Industry Corp. to help design a new way to control the plane. </p>
<p>The deal announced yesterday with China''s Commercial
Aircraft Corp. also marks the first foray into the integration
and supply of such control equipment by GE Aviation Systems,
part of the world''s biggest jet-engine maker, and AVIC. </p>
<p>GE and AVIC targeted the 150-seat C919 when they unveiled
their 50-50 avionics venture in November. They plan to compete
with suppliers such as Honeywell International Inc., United
Technologies Corp. and Rockwell Collins Inc. by using so-called
open-architecture software that isn''t tied to one manufacturer. </p>
<p>One of the benefits of this system is that you can
replace dozens of traditional stand-alone computers with less
weight, better reliability, lower complexity, said Lorraine Bolsinger, who runs GE Aviation Systems, in a telephone
interview ahead of next week''s Farnborough Air Show near London. </p>
<p>Comac, as the Chinese planemaker is known, is promoting the
C919 as a rival to Boeing Co.''s bestselling 737 and Airbus SAS''s
A320. The C919 is due to enter service in 2016, and Comac
predicts having 2,300 of the single-aisle planes in operation
over the next two decades. </p>
<p>For GE, the venture means a chance to take advantage of
Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt''s $4.8 billion purchase
of Smiths Group Plc''s aviation unit in 2007. The acquisition
added electronics to the engine business at Fairfield,
Connecticut-based GE. </p>
<p>Big Risk'' </p>
<p>Given GE and Smiths'' lack of expertise with a project
like this, it''s a very big risk, especially for the Chinese,
said Richard Aboulafia, an analyst at Fairfax, Virginia-based
Teal Group. </p>
<p>GE''s entry into the avionics market may take business from
suppliers such as Honeywell, Rockwell Collins and Thales SA,
said Michel Merluzeau, an aviation analyst at G2 Solutions in
Kirkland, Washington. </p>
<p>This is a huge deal, perhaps one of those events that has
the potential to redefine the avionics market once every 15 to
20 years, Merluzeau said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>GE Aviation supplies the core computing system on Boeing''s
787 jumbo jet. In looking for a partner to begin selling open-
source systems, GE Aviation saw AVIC as a very natural
choice, Bolsinger said. </p>
<p>Yesterday''s contract announcement came a week before
planemakers and parts manufacturers gather in Farnborough for
the industry''s biggest showcase for new products. Many of the
companies are rushing to court business in China as travel
demand rises in the world''s most-populous country. </p>
<p>Growth Market </p>
<p>China is the world''s fastest-growing aviation market and
we need to ensure GE and the United States are part of this
growth, John Rice, a GE vice chairman who oversees divisions
including GE Aviation, said in a statement announcing the C919
contract. </p>
<p>AVIC Vice President Zhang Xinguo said the venture with GE
envisions adding customers in the U.S. and elsewhere. </p>
<p>The C919, which will join the narrow-body Boeing and Airbus
jets that are the workhorses of airline fleets worldwide, is
already drawing U.S.-based manufacturers. Honeywell said last
week it won a contract valued at more than $3 billion to supply
brakes and other parts for the plane. </p>
<p>Rockwell Collins said yesterday it signed a letter of
intent to provide communications and navigation systems through
a venture with China Electronics Technology Avionics Co., while
Eaton Corp. and Comac''s Shanghai Aircraft Manufacturing Co. said
they formed a venture for fuel- and hydraulic-system parts. </p>
<p>GE fell 2 cents to $14.93 yesterday in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have dropped 1.3 percent
this year, compared with a 2 percent decline for the Dow Jones
Industrial Average. </p>
<p>GE said the contract will support jobs in the U.S., China
and the U.K. About $6 billion of GE''s revenue last year came
from China, Immelt said last week. Sales totaled $157 billion.
Sales in China should rise by at least 10 percent this year,
Immelt reiterated last week. </p>

<p>Spokeswoman Alyson Barnes confirmed Bohart and Trevor''s
plans to exit Morgan Stanley Investment Management and declined

<p>The unit had pretax profit of $173 million in the first

Stanley sold its retail asset-management business, including the
Van Kampen funds, to Invesco Ltd. last month to focus on
institutional funds. </p>
<p>Bohart, who oversaw the core asset-management business, had
worked at Morgan Stanley since 1997. Trevor joined the firm in

Fleming, a former Merrill Lynch  Co. executive who was hired by
Chief Executive Officer James Gorman in December. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley said in a statement earlier today that it
appointed Michael Kushma chief investment officer for global
fixed-income in the bank''s asset-management unit. He will
oversee the unit''s fixed-income strategies, the New York-based

<p>Commonwealth Bank of Australia leads
the nation''s four biggest banks in preparing a deluge of
bond sales as they seek to refinance notes and fund lending,
driving up costs for the most indebted, Morgan Stanley said. </p>
<p>Commonwealth Bank, Westpac Banking Corp., National
Australia Bank Ltd. and Australia  New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd. need to borrow about A$140 billion ($122 billion) in the
year to Sept. 30 and A$162 billion in the following 12 months,
Morgan Stanley strategists led by Pieter Van Der Schaft wrote in
a note e-mailed today. </p>
<p>Investors will increasingly differentiate between banks
on the basis of funding requirements, the strategists said.
Most sales will have to be done at a higher cost offshore due
to limited onshore absorption capacity of new bank issuance. </p>
<p>Australia''s top four banks, facing tougher capital rules
requiring them to hold more liquid assets and less of each
others'' debt, are seeking funds offshore in an effort to cut
borrowing costs. The extra yield investors demand to hold
Australian financial company debt instead of government bonds
has jumped 22 basis points since the start of June, a Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index shows. </p>
<p>Westpac, Australia''s second-biggest bank by market value,
raised A$800 million from five-year bonds on June 29, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The notes, priced to yield 135 basis points more than the
bank bill swap-rate, caused spreads on comparable four- and six-
year Australian dollar-denominated bank bonds to widen by 15
basis points, Morgan Stanley said. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. directors should be held
liable for the drugmaker''s repeated violations of federal laws
governing drug-marketing practices that resulted in the company
having to pay a $2.3 billion settlement, a union pension fund
said in a lawsuit. </p>
<p>New York-based Pfizer''s board turned a blind eye to
criminal guilty pleas the company entered over marketing
practices for medicines such its Bextra pain-killing drug and
its Neurontin epilepsy pill, the Bricklayers Local 8  Plasters
Local 233 Pension Fund, a Pfizer shareholder, said in the suit.
Directors'' inaction has hurt the value of investors'' stakes in
the company, the fund''s lawyers contend. </p>
<p>The board and senior management made a calculated bet
that the negative consequences of getting caught would never
become significant, the fund''s attorneys said today in the
Delaware Chancery Court complaint. Defendants lost that bet. </p>
<p>The $2.3 billion settlement to resolve government probes
into Pfizer''s marketing practices was the largest accord in
history to address such sales techniques. Proceeds from the
accord went to government health agencies including Medicare,
Medicaid and the military''s Tricare health plan. </p>
<p>Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, didn''t return calls and
an e-mail for comment on the suit. Pfizer is the world''s biggest
drugmaker. </p>
<p>Red Flags'' </p>
<p>Pfizer has paid at least $2.7 billion to settle claims over
its marketing practices pressed by government regulators or by
consumers suing over its products, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>In addition to the $2.3 billion it paid over Bextra and
other drugs, the company paid $430 million to resolve
prosecutors'' claims that it illegally marketed Neurontin. </p>
<p>The fact that Pfizer has been operated with a systematic
disregard for the laws governing its fundamental business was
not hidden from the board, which repeatedly and knowingly
disregarded red flags that clearly demonstrated the company''s
wrongdoing, the fund''s lawyers said in the suit. </p>
<p>The fund wants directors held liable for the company''s
improper acts and seek to recoup all profits, benefits and
other compensation they reaped as board members. </p>
<p>The case is Bricklayers Local v. Ausiello and Pfizer Inc.,
CA5631, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). </p>

<p>General Growth Properties Inc., the
second-largest U.S. mall operator, filed a reorganization plan
saying it will split itself into two companies when it exits
bankruptcy in October. </p>
<p>Under the proposal in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York,
General Growth will fully repay debt and other claims, raise as
much as $8.5 billion of new capital and issue stock in two new
companies to current shareholders. </p>
<p>Today''s filing marks the start of the last stage of General
Growth''s bankruptcy case, which began after the company failed
to refinance its debt during the credit crunch. At the time,
commercial real estate prices in the U.S. had dropped 15 percent
and retail sales had fallen as job losses forced consumers to
pull back. </p>
<p>Things went from bleak to full payment, said Kirk Ruddy, senior vice president of trading at APS Capital Corp. and
a former Bear Stearns Cos. claims trader. </p>
<p>The company''s exit from bankruptcy is being funded by
Brookfield Asset Management Inc., Fairholme Capital Management
LLC and Pershing Square Capital Management LLC, General Growth
said today in a statement. </p>
<p>The company has already won court approval to restructure
$15 billion of secured debt tied to 144 properties. </p>
<p>General Growth in May received court approval to move
forward with financing commitments from the companies after
rejecting a competing bid from Simon Property Group Inc., the
largest mall owner. </p>
<p>180 Properties </p>
<p>It expects to emerge from reorganization in October and
remain the second-largest mall owner in the U.S., with 180
properties in 43 states. </p>
<p>General Growth began the largest real-estate reorganization
in history by filing under Chapter 11 in April 2009. </p>
<p>The two new General Growth companies will divide the
assets, with the larger one keeping the name and most of the
malls and receiving at least $6.3 billion of the new investment,
according to the statement. </p>
<p>The smaller company will get mixed-use residential
properties and $250 million through a rights offering, said
David Keating, a spokesman. </p>
<p>The Chicago-based company filed for bankruptcy after
amassing a $27 billion debt load while making acquisitions.
Since the filing, it has restructured $15 billion worth of its
project-level debt. </p>
<p>The Teacher Retirement System of Texas agreed yesterday to
invest $500 million in the company. </p>
<p>The filing of the plan is an important milestone in our
restructuring process, Chief Executive Officer Adam Metz said
in the statement. </p>
<p>The case is In re General Growth Properties Inc., 09-11977,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>

<p>National Bank of Canada, the
country''s sixth-biggest bank, was cited among five defensive
financial stocks by Morgan Stanley. </p>

within the Canadian banks, the strongest asset quality and also
the most insulation to potential weakness in the U.S. and the
broader global economy, Morgan Stanley analyst Cheryl Pate
said on a conference call today. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley also recommended Chubb Corp., MetLife Inc.,
People''s United Financial Inc. and Travelers Cos. for a
defensive portfolio in case the U.S. economy is weaker than
expected. Montreal-based National Bank was highlighted because
it has very little international exposure, earning 65
percent of revenue from the province of Quebec. </p>
<p>National Bank may also raise its dividend one quarter
before Canada''s other banks, Pate said in the webcast call. </p>
<p>We believe the next catalyst for National is going to be
a dividend increase, Pate said. We think National''s going to
be the first of the Canadian banks to raise the dividend, and
we''re expecting this in the fourth quarter of this year. </p>

stands to earn a $23 million fee for the assignment. Last year,
he advised Bristol-Myers, the New York drugmaker, on its $2.4
billion acquisition of Medarex Inc. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley has been adding investment bankers from
competitors this year, hiring energy bankers Michael Johnson,
Jonathan Cox, and Eduardo Miras from Deutsche Bank AG and
Citigroup Inc. financial-services specialist Gary Shedlin.
Outside of the investment bank, it''s hired 100 bankers to offer

<p>Microsoft Corp. is paying developers
to build mobile applications for its Windows Phone 7 system to
help it narrow a lead by rival products from Apple Inc. and
Google Inc. </p>
<p>The company is providing financial incentives ranging from
free tools and test handsets to funds for software development
and marketing, said Todd Brix, a senior director at Microsoft
who works with app developers. In some cases, Microsoft is
providing revenue guarantees, and will make up the difference if
apps don''t sell as well as expected, he said. </p>
<p>Microsoft revamped its flagship mobile operating system to
recoup market share lost to Google and Apple. To win consumers,
the world''s largest software maker needs an ample supply of
games, music and navigation apps when handsets with Windows
Phone 7 reach stores later this year. Some developers may be
reluctant to sign up before they know Windows Phone will lure
enough customers, said Kevin Burden, an analyst at ABI Research. </p>
<p>In no way do they want to say, Trust us, there will be
apps at some point,'' said Burden, who is based in Hopkinton,
Massachusetts. If that means paying developers, so be it. It''s
a good strategy for them. </p>
<p>While Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, has used
similar compensation programs for previous versions of its
mobile operating system, it''s devoting a larger sum this time,
Brix said. He declined to say how much Microsoft will spend. </p>
<p>Open for Business'' </p>
<p>We are investing a lot to attract developers big and small
to Windows Phone 7 to let them understand what the opportunity
is and provide as many resources as we can to help them be
successful on our platform, Brix said. We''re open for business
and we want to work with them. </p>
<p>Microsoft needs a hit to turn around its mobile business,
which Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said this week
missed a generation. </p>
<p>Windows accounted for 6.9 percent of the worldwide
smartphone-software market in the first quarter, from 10.8
percent a year earlier, according ABI. Shipments of the iPhone
rose to 15.8 percent, while Android handsets had 9.9 percent. </p>
<p>At least four app makers have been approached by Microsoft
and offered financial incentives in cash, assistance with
development costs or revenue guarantees in exchange for having
apps ready at or near the release of Windows Phone 7, said five
people with knowledge of the matter. The people declined to be
named because the incentive terms are confidential. </p>
<p>Fewer Apps Than Apple </p>
<p>Other mobile software makers use different approaches to
entice programmers. Apple shares a portion of the revenue
generated when consumers buy apps from its online store. With
more than 51 million iPhones sold since its 2007 debut,
Cupertino, California-based Apple hasn''t offered payments like
Microsoft''s incentives to gain programs, the people said. </p>
<p>Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller declined to comment. </p>
<p>Apple has about 225,000 apps available for the iPhone,
while devices that run on Google''s Android operating system have
access to some 65,000. </p>
<p>Microsoft is starting from scratch in amassing apps for
Windows Phone 7. Its overhaul of the operating system was so
complete that programs developed for older Windows-based phones
won''t work on the new one. At the end of last year, Microsoft
had only 246 apps, according to ABI. </p>
<p>Microsoft rose 31 cents to $25.44 at 4 p.m. New York time
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares have declined 17 percent
this year. </p>
<p>The company''s deep pockets and the likelihood it will keep
investing in Windows Phone 7 mean Microsoft may have an easier
time luring developers than a smaller company, Burden said. </p>
<p>Unproven Prospect'' </p>
<p>Developers expect Windows Phone 7 to be successful, three
of the people said. Yet it''s difficult to get companies to build
software for an operating system that doesn''t exist yet. </p>
<p>There''s absolutely less enthusiasm today for Windows Phone
7 -- developers develop for the platform with largest number of
users because that''s where they can make the most money, said
Matt Rosoff, an analyst at Directions on Microsoft in Kirkland,
Washington. Windows Phone 7 is an unproven prospect. It
definitely makes sense for Microsoft to prime the pump a little
bit. </p>
<p>Last month, Microsoft scrapped an effort to sell its own
phone, less than two months after the device debuted. Sales of
the Kin social-networking phones fell short of the company''s
expectations, a person familiar with the matter said then. </p>

investment-banking unit at New York-based JPMorgan Chase. </p>
<p>Staley said investment bank co-chair Jimmy Lee will
continue to serve as our senior dealmaker and manage many of
our top client relationships. He''ll also be an adviser to
Urwin and Willsey, Staley said. </p>
<p>Urwin, 54, joined the firm when it acquired Bear Stearns
Cos. in 2008 and Willsey, 47, was previously JPMorgan''s chairman
of global equity capital and derivative markets. Willsey, who
started at JPMorgan in 1989, rejoined the bank in 2002 after a
two-year stint at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>Both Jeff and Kevin are outstanding individuals with
impeccable character and a drive to serve clients, Staley told
employees in the memo, which was confirmed by spokeswoman Tasha Pelio. Staley said the two will manage the business jointly,
focusing on their own areas of expertise. </p>
<p>Urwin was JPMorgan''s head of investment banking coverage of
the Americas. He previously was co-head of investment banking at
Bear Stearns, which he joined in 1996, and head of global
emerging markets at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in New York. </p>
<p>Visa, Wells Fargo Deals </p>
<p>Willsey has raised capital for clients in the U.S., Europe,
Asia and Latin America, according to JPMorgan. He has managed
major financing deals, including Visa Inc.''s $19.7 billion
initial public offering, Wells Fargo  Co.''s $12.6 billion
equity offering used to acquire Wachovia Corp. and JPMorgan''s
own $11.5 billion equity deal to acquire assets of Washington
Mutual Inc., the company said. </p>
<p>Lee, 57, advised UAL Corp.''s United Airlines on its $3.1
billion merger with Continental Airlines Inc. earlier this year.
He also helped General Electric Co. sell a majority stake in NBC
Universal to Comcast Corp. last year and led negotiations with
the U.S. Treasury Department on behalf of Chrysler LLC bank-debt
holders. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. said the 12th
alleged member of a Russian spy ring operating in the U.S. was
an employee at the company''s Redmond, Washington, headquarters. </p>
<p>The man, a Russian citizen in his early 20s named Alexey
Karetnikov, worked for Microsoft as a software tester for about
nine months, a spokeswoman for Microsoft in Moscow, who declined
to be identified in line with company rules, said by e-mail
today. </p>
<p>Russia''s Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the news
when contacted by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Ten members of the spy ring pleaded guilty to conspiring to
serve as unregistered foreign agents on June 8 in a U.S. federal
court in Manhattan. They admitted to carrying money or coded
messages, secretly communicating with Russian officials and
instructing others on how to find information useful to Russia.
Their objective was to infiltrate U.S. policy-making circles
after constructing false American identities, prosecutors said. </p>
<p>Karetnikov was deported on charges of violating U.S.
immigration laws, Itar-Tass reported, citing Matt Chandler, a
spokesman for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
Karetnikov admitted to the violation and agreed to deportation
to avoid court proceedings, the state-run news service said. </p>
<p>Software Company </p>
<p>The Facebook page of a person identified as Alexey
Karetnikov shows that he is married and graduated from St.
Petersburg State Polytechnic University in 2009. He worked for a
company called Neobit in addition to Microsoft, according to
the Facebook page. </p>
<p>A St. Petersburg-based software developer called OOO NeoBIT
lists Katernikov''s university among its partners and the Federal
Security Service, the main successor to the Soviet-era KGB,
among its clients, according to the company''s website. </p>
<p>No one at NeoBIT''s offices answered repeated calls from
Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>Strategic Forecasting Inc. said yesterday another member of
the ring tried to get the risk advisory group to install
software he said his company had developed. </p>
<p>Assumed Names </p>
<p>A man calling himself Donald Heathfield held five meetings
with an employee of Austin, Texas-based Stratfor in an effort to
get the firm to use his program, Chief Executive Officer George Friedman said in an e-mailed report. Heathfield, who later
identified himself as Andrey Bezrukov, was one of 10 people U.S.
authorities traded for four Russians on July 9 in Vienna. </p>
<p>We suspect that had this been done, our servers would be
outputting to Moscow, Friedman said. We did not know at the
time who he was. We have since reported the incident to the
FBI. </p>
<p>Bezrukov and his partner in the network were sentenced to
time served and deported after agreeing to give up their home on
Trowbridge Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and all the funds
in four bank accounts. Bezrukov''s partner, who was identified as
Tracey Foley at the time of her arrest, told the court her real
name was Elena Vavilova. </p>
<p>Bezrukov, Vavilova and the other members of the spy ring
are being debriefed at the Foreign Intelligence Service''s
compound in southern Moscow, Moskovsky Komsomolets, Russia''s
second-biggest newspaper by circulation, reported yesterday,
citing unidentified Russian security officials. That process may
last weeks, the Moscow-based daily said. </p>
<p>Some of the 10 agents may continue to work with the
security service, while others will be free to pursue new
careers, Moskovsky Komsomolets said. </p>

<p>Kathy Matsui, an investment
strategist in Japan for Goldman Sachs Group Inc., cut her three-
month estimate for the Topix index by 5.3 percent, citing
political uncertainties and the yen''s appreciation. </p>
<p>Matsui lowered the target to 900 from 950, according to a
report dated yesterday, when the gauge closed at 854.39. The
strategist cut her six-month estimate to 950 from 1,000 and the
12-month prediction to 1,020 from 1,150, the report said. </p>
<p>The Topix fell 0.8 percent in the previous two days after
the ruling Democratic Party of Japan lost control of the upper
house in a weekend election. The yen climbed a week ago to near
its highest level in seven months as concerns over the health of
the global economy caused some investors to seek refuge in
Japan''s currency. A stronger yen hurts the value of export
revenue that is repatriated. </p>
<p>In the short term, political uncertainties will likely
mount and the policymaking processes may become more
cumbersome, Matsui wrote in the Japanese-language report.
The most powerful driver for an increase in investment in
Japanese stocks is the yen''s depreciation. </p>
<p>The strategist raised her rating on communication and
transportation companies to overweight from neutral,
citing large cash flows and the possibility of China relaxing
tightening policies. She also recommends retail and real-estate
companies that should be supported by economic measures such as
child-care allowances and tax breaks for home buyers. </p>
<p>Matsui lowered her call on the precision-machinery and
consumer-electronics industries to neutral from
overweight, because a slowdown in the U.S. economy may hurt
profits of companies that rely on overseas sales. </p>

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc., accused by
the U.S. government of defrauding investors, is generating
better returns for companies and buyers of initial public
offerings than any other Wall Street firm. </p>
<p>American companies that used New York-based Goldman Sachs
as the lead underwriter for initial sales got the highest prices
for their shares in the first half of 2010, selling at an
average 1.4 percent discount to their offering range, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Buyers were rewarded with an average
first-day advance of 9.6 percent, the biggest this year. </p>
<p>The U.S. IPO market is proving why Goldman Sachs, the most
profitable securities firm in Wall Street''s history, is still
the bank of choice for companies looking to raise capital and
buyers seeking the biggest returns, finance professors at the
University of Chicago and the University of Notre Dame said.
Offerings led by Credit Suisse Group AG and JPMorgan Chase  Co.
were discounted the most and produced the smallest gains,
Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>The issuer and investor care about the opposite things,
and the investment bank is in the middle, said Steven Kaplan,
professor of finance at the University of Chicago''s Booth School
of Business. There''s conflict. Goldman appears to have done
very well. </p>
<p>SEC Charges </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein''s firm is beating
competitors in an area that generates some of Wall Street''s
biggest fees. Bankers charged 6.4 percent for underwriting U.S.
IPOs this year, more than 10 times that for mergers and
acquisitions and corporate bonds, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs won the largest share of the $580 million in
fees from initial offerings in the first half, even after the
Securities and Exchange Commission sued the firm in April for
allegedly selling mortgage-related securities that were designed
to fail. The bank has called the SEC''s lawsuit completely
unfounded. </p>
<p>SEC spokesman John Nester declined to comment. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs was the so-called lead-left underwriter for
11 U.S. IPOs in the first half, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
More than half of those were priced above the middle of the
offering range, while Goldman Sachs-led deals accounted for four
of this year''s five biggest premiums, the data indicate. </p>
<p>Companies that didn''t hire the 141-year old firm to lead
their IPOs took an average discount of 14 percent for their
shares. </p>
<p>First-Day Gains </p>
<p>Buying initial sales from Goldman Sachs has produced first-
day gains that are more than double the average 3.6 percent for
offerings arranged by other banks, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. In the first month of trading, IPOs led by Morgan Stanley
produced the largest returns, rising 7.8 percent on average. </p>
<p> Andrea Rachman, a spokeswoman at Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment. </p>
<p> Financial Engines Inc., the investment adviser co-founded
by Nobel laureate William Sharpe, garnered the largest premium
of any U.S. IPO this year in a March deal led by Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>The provider of portfolio-management services to people
with employer-sponsored retirement plans jumped 44 percent in
its first day, the biggest surge this year, after selling shares
at $12 each. The price was 20 percent higher than the Palo Alto,
California-based company had originally asked buyers to pay. </p>
<p>Goldman is clearly the king investment banker, said Tim Loughran, a finance professor at the University of Notre Dame''s
Mendoza College of Business in Notre Dame, Indiana. They''ve
come under fire, but it doesn''t matter. If you''re an issuing
firm, that''s the first firm you would go to. </p>
<p>Tesla Motors </p>
<p>While the first-day performance of initial sales led by
Goldman Sachs helped buyers reap immediate profits, investors
that held onto the shares have seen the gains diminish. The
advance for the 11 IPOs shrank to 2.5 percent on average over
the first month of trading, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p> Tesla Motors Inc., the Palo Alto-based maker of the
electric Roadster, erased almost all its 41 percent first-day
surge in the next nine days after the first IPO by an American
car company since 1956. </p>
<p>The automaker run by Elon Musk raised $260 million selling
shares for $17 each, 13 percent higher than the midpoint of its
forecast price range and the third-largest premium for a U.S.
company this year. Tesla''s stock ended at $18.14 yesterday, 24
percent below its first-day close of $23.89. </p>
<p>The Credibility'' </p>
<p>For the underwriter, first-day success is a very
important measure in terms of certifying the power and the
credibility of the franchise, said Josef Schuster, the
Chicago-based founder of IPOX Capital Management LLC, which
oversees $3 billion. A good first-day pop certifies the
quality job the underwriter has done with investors and the
company in order to further deals. </p>
<p>Schuster, who purchased Tesla shares for his Direxion
Long/Short Global IPO Fund, sold 30 percent of his stake on the
second day of trading as the stock rose as much as 79 percent
from its offering price. </p>
<p>Some deals arranged by Goldman Sachs have helped private
equity sellers while leaving IPO buyers with losses. </p>
<p>The initial offering of Metals USA Holdings Corp., a Fort
Lauderdale, Florida-based metals processor, almost quadrupled
the value for Leon Black''s New York-based leveraged-buyout firm
Apollo Global Management LLC''s investment. The shares lost 8.6
percent on the first day and 28 percent after one month. </p>
<p>Besides Financial Engines and Tesla, four other IPOs led by
Goldman Sachs -- Calix Inc. of Petaluma, California, Chicago-
based Accretive Health Inc. and CBOE Holdings Inc., and Higher
One Holdings Inc. in New Haven, Connecticut -- climbed at least
12 percent in their first day of trading. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, which led IPOs that had an average 7.5
percent first-day gain, completed every deal that it
participated in after marketing began, according to Paul Donahue, the firm''s co-head of U.S. equity capital markets. </p>
<p>Every other bank had at least one deal that was scuttled,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Americold Realty Trust, the
Atlanta-based warehouse operator owned by Ron Burkle''s Yucaipa
Cos., postponed what would have been the largest IPO of 2010 in
May after cutting its midpoint price by 33 percent. Goldman
Sachs was hired to lead the IPO. </p>
<p>It''s fair to say that everyone entered 2010 with great
expectations and the market has proven to be trickier than
people would have thought entering the year, said Morgan
Stanley''s Donahue. It''s exactly these types of markets where
we think Morgan Stanley as a franchise has differentiated
itself. </p>
<p>Credit Suisse, JPMorgan </p>
<p>All five U.S. companies that listed Credit Suisse as the
first underwriter took price cuts. The average 21 percent
discount from the original midpoint offer price was the biggest
for any firm''s deals. </p>
<p>Sales arranged by Zurich-based Credit Suisse, Switzerland''s
second-biggest bank, also left investors with the smallest
first-day returns as four of the five companies rose less than 1
percent. The gains then turned into declines that averaged 7.8
percent in the first month, making it the only bank whose deals
lost money for IPO buyers in the period, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p> Alimera Sciences Inc., the Alpharetta, Georgia-based
developer of treatments for diseases of the retina, sold its
shares for $11 each after cutting the range from $15 to $17 in
an offering led by Credit Suisse. The stock closed unchanged in
its first day of trading before falling 27 percent in the next
month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p> Duncan King, a Credit Suisse spokesman, declined to
comment. </p>
<p>Winning Deals </p>
<p>Pricing above or below the range generally reflects
strong or weak demand relative to what was originally
expected, said Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the
University of Florida in Gainesville who has studied IPOs for
three decades. If an underwriter is consistently pricing below
the range, however, it might mean that it had been aggressive in
suggesting a high valuation in order to win deals. </p>
<p>Six of the eight companies that hired New York-based
JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. bank, to lead their IPOs sold
shares at a discount. The average price reduction equaled 20.9
percent, the data show. </p>
<p> AVEO Pharmaceuticals Inc., which is developing a kidney-
cancer treatment, took the biggest cut, reducing its price by 36
percent. The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company sold shares
at $9 each after offering them at $13 to $15. </p>
<p>The initial sales by JPMorgan produced first-day gains of
3.5 percent, less than every bank except for Credit Suisse.
JPMorgan spokeswoman Tasha Pelio declined to comment. </p>
<p>It''s a balancing act, said Lisa Jacobs, a New York-
based partner in the capital markets group at law firm Shearman
 Sterling LLP. Lead underwriters are looking for that price
at which both the companies and investors get the benefit of the
bargain and feel they''ve gotten a good deal. It''s a fair amount
of science but it''s also a little bit of art. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp., the oil producer
fighting lawsuits over environmental damage from drilling in
Ecuador, won a request to see outtakes from Crude: The Real
Price of Oil, a film about oil exploration in the country. </p>
<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals in New York today ordered
filmmaker Joseph Berlinger to turn over footage not included in
the publicly released version of the movie. Appearing in the so-
called outtakes are lawyers for the plaintiffs in a lawsuit
against Chevron, private and court-appointed experts in the
suit, and current and former Ecuadorian officials. </p>
<p>We have already seen instances of collusion and fraud on
the part of plaintiffs'' lawyers in portions of Crude that have
been publicly released, Justin Higgs, a spokesman for Chevron
said in an e-mailed statement. We are confident that review of
the outtakes will reveal additional instances of misconduct. </p>
<p>Chevron won a lower court ruling in May ordering Berlinger
to surrender outtakes from his documentary about the San Ramon,
California-based company''s operations in Ecuador. The company
argued that footage shot for the film may be relevant in a
lawsuit brought by Ecuadoreans, in Chevron''s arbitration against
Ecuador, and in criminal proceedings in the South American
country. </p>
<p>The lower-court judge postponed a Chevron subpoena
requiring Berlinger to surrender his outtakes to allow him to
appeal the ruling. Berlinger''s lawyer, Maura Wogan, had argued
that rulings against her client will compromise the rights of
other documentary makers protecting their unpublished material. </p>
<p>Wogan didn''t immediately return a call seeking comment
today. </p>
<p>The district court case is In re Application of Chevron
Corp., M-19-111, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). The appeals court case is Chevron v.
Berlinger, 10-1918, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
Court (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. agreed to
pay $550 million and change its business practices to settle
U.S. regulatory claims it misled investors in collateralized
debt obligations linked to subprime mortgages. </p>
<p>The penalty is the largest ever levied by the Securities
and Exchange Commission against a Wall Street firm, the agency
said in a statement announcing the accord today. Under the deal,
Goldman Sachs acknowledged it made a mistake and that
marketing materials for the instruments had incomplete
information, the agency said. </p>
<p>For Goldman Sachs, the payment amounts to 14 days of
earnings, based on first-quarter results. It''s the equivalent
of 93 cents a share, said Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford
Bernstein  Co., who had estimated a cost of $1.05. </p>
<p>This appears to be negligence, not fraud, Hintz said in
an e-mail, citing the SEC''s use of words such as mistake and
incomplete information. Bottom line the SEC and the
administration gets a headline and a political win'' and GS gets
an economic win.'' </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs created and sold the CDOs in 2007, as the
U.S. housing market faltered, without disclosing that hedge fund
Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying securities and bet
against the vehicles, the SEC said in an April 16 lawsuit.
Billionaire John Paulson''s firm earned $1 billion on the trade
and wasn''t accused of wrongdoing. </p>
<p>It Was a Mistake'' </p>
<p>It was a mistake for the Goldman marketing materials to
state that the reference portfolio was selected by'' ACA
Management LLC without disclosing the role of Paulson  Co. Inc.
in the portfolio selection process, the SEC''s statement quoted
Goldman Sachs as saying in settlement documents. </p>
<p>The bank, based in New York, didn''t admit or deny
wrongdoing under the accord, the SEC said. The payment includes
a $300 million fine and $250 million as restitution to
investors. IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG, the first German
lender bailed out during the subprime crisis, will receive $150
million, and Royal Bank of Scotland Plc will get $100 million,
the SEC said. </p>
<p>Shares of Goldman Sachs, which closed today at $145.22,
dropped 21 percent since April 15, the day before the suit was
filed, and jumped 4.4 percent today after the SEC said it
planned a significant announcement. The SP 500 Financial
Index declined 13 percent since the SEC filed suit. </p>
<p>This takes a cloud off the stock, said Peter Sorrentino, senior portfolio manager at Huntington Asset
Advisors in Cincinnati, which manages $13.3 billion including
Goldman Sachs shares. For Goldman Sachs, the settlement means
we''re done, turn the spotlight off, we''re out of here, he
said. </p>
<p>Fabrice Tourre''s Case </p>
<p>Sorrentino said his firm may still reduce its holdings in
Goldman Sachs on any price gains because he''s concerned about
the effect of financial regulatory legislation passed today by
the Senate. Goldman Sachs said the agency doesn''t anticipate''''
it will bring more claims linked to collateralized debt
obligations. </p>
<p>Fabrice Tourre, the only Goldman Sachs worker targeted by
the SEC, remains an employee of the firm and is on leave, said
Lucas van Praag, a company spokesman. The firm promised to
cooperate with the SEC in the case against Tourre and other
ongoing litigation, the agency''s deputy enforcement
director, Lorin Reisner, told reporters in Washington. </p>
<p>SEC Enforcement Director Robert Khuzami called the
settlement a stark lesson to Wall Street firms that no product
is too complex, and no investor too sophisticated, to avoid a
heavy price if a firm violates the fundamental principles of
honest treatment and fair dealing. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs jumped in New York trading after the

significant announcement at a 4:45 p.m. news conference. </p>
<p>The New York Times reported that the firm will pay $550

that, Goldman Sachs will pay $300 million in fines and the rest
will be restitution. </p>
<p>If and when a settlement is reached, the pool of
potential investors in Goldman stock will get expanded,
Michael Mayo, an analyst at CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets in New

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, said profit rose 76 percent, buoyed
by a $6.3 billion reduction in provisions for soured mortgages
and credit-card loans from last year. </p>
<p>Second-quarter net income climbed to $4.8 billion, or $1.09
a share, even as revenue fell 7.6 percent, the New York-based
company said today in a statement. The bank earned $2.72
billion, or 28 cents, in the same period a year earlier and
$3.33 billion in the first quarter. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 54, said he isn''t
satisfied with the results, even though they surpassed the most
optimistic analyst''s estimate, because consumer lending charge-
offs and late payments remain high. A 7.6 percent decline in
revenue prompted Shannon Stemm, an analyst for Edward Jones 
Co. in St. Louis, to question whether the profit report masked
weakness in JPMorgan''s main businesses. </p>
<p>The results beat estimates by so much because of the
large reserve release, Stemm said. Revenue fell quarter over
quarter and year over year, largely driven by weaker investment-
banking and fixed-income trading results, which were down
because of the volatile trading environment. </p>
<p>JPMorgan rose 11 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $40.46 in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange at 4 p.m. The
stock lost 3.2 percent this year through yesterday. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
largest U.S. bank by assets, won dismissal of a lawsuit by a
victim of Bernard L. Madoff''s Ponzi scheme, claiming the bank
knowingly participated in the fraud. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Barbara S. Jones in New York threw out
the suit filed by MLSMK Investments Co., which said the New
York-based bank in September 2008 investigated Madoff,
determined he was a fraud and liquidated its $250 million
investment in a Madoff-linked fund. </p>
<p>While it might have been possible for defendants to
determine that Madoff was committing fraud from the red flags''
that plaintiff points out, plaintiff alleges no facts to
demonstrate that defendants actually did make such a
discovery, Jones wrote in an opinion released today. </p>
<p>MLSMK, a Palm Beach, Florida, partnership, claimed it lost
$12.8 million to Madoff from October to December 2008, the month
he was arrested and charged in history''s biggest Ponzi scheme.
The case alleged civil racketeering, negligence and bad faith. </p>
<p>We thought we laid out enough of a factual basis, at the
pleading stage, to show that Chase knew at least by September
2008 that Madoff was committing fraud, but continued providing
services that enabled him to continue the fraud, said Howard Kleinhendler, a lawyer for MLSMK. </p>
<p>Kleinhendler said his client is considering an appeal. </p>
<p>Stolen Money </p>
<p>The suit, filed in April 2009, claimed MLSMK deposited the
$12.8 million in Madoff''s Chase account, expecting that the
money would be used to buy and sell securities for its benefit.
Madoff never invested the money and instead stole it. </p>
<p>MLSMK claimed that in 2008, when most investors in stocks
were losing money, JPMorgan became suspicious of Madoff''s
consistently high returns. JPMorgan employees met with Madoff
and did their own investigation of Bernard L. Madoff Investment
Services LLC, MLSMK said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan unequivocally concluded that Madoff''s reported
returns were false and illegitimate and quietly liquidated
its $250 million position in a Madoff-linked fund, MLSMK said.
JPMorgan then decided to partner with him in the fleecing of
his victims, the firm claimed. </p>
<p>JPMorgan helped Madoff perpetuate his fraud by continuing
to provide banking services and trade with Madoff''s market-
making business after learning of the fraud, MLSMK claimed. </p>
<p>Madoff, 72, pleaded guilty to fraud and other crimes on
March 12, 2009, and is serving a 150-year prison term. </p>
<p>The case is: MLSMK Investments Co. v. JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
09-CV-4049, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. should return
more capital to investors after buying back $500 million in
shares, according to Charles Peabody, a partner and research
analyst at Portales Partners LLC. </p>
<p>If they have this fortress-type balance sheet with excess
capital and excess loan loss reserves, they should start
returning that to shareholders in various forms, Peabody said
today during a radio interview with Tom Keene on Bloomberg
Surveillance. </p>
<p>The bank bought back $135 million of the shares through the
end of the second quarter and the rest this month, Michael Cavanagh, the New York-based company''s chief executive officer
for Treasury and security services, told journalists on a
conference call today. </p>
<p>It''s a start, said Peabody, who recommended JPMorgan
buy back more shares or pursue an acquisition. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank, said it had $108.2
billion, or 9.6 percent of assets, in Tier 1 regulatory capital,
a core measure of solvency demanded by regulators that includes
common stock and disclosed reserves. </p>
<p>Quarterly net income increased 76 percent to $4.8 billion,
or $1.09 a share, beating an average estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of analysts for adjusted earnings of 71 cents. Profit
grew even as revenue fell 7.6 percent. </p>
<p>U.S. banks have been hesitant to return capital to
shareholders following the worst economic crisis since the Great
Depression. </p>
<p>Dimon on Dividends </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said today in a
conference call that his preference is to buy back stock rather
than raise the dividend. He said last month that it may be too
ambitious to expect a dividend increase by the year-end. </p>
<p>Pushing a dividend increase back until 2011 is probably
too long a time to wait, Peabody said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is the first of the largest U.S. banks to report
earnings. Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc., the first-
and third-largest U.S. lenders, respectively, may report
earnings of $2.6 billion and $1.46 billion when they release
results tomorrow, Bloomberg surveys show. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, plans to sell 10-year global notes
as soon as today after reporting profit rose 76 percent, more
than analysts estimated. </p>
<p>The sale will be benchmark in size, according to a person
familiar with the transaction, who declined to be identified
because terms aren''t set. A benchmark sale is typically at least
$500 million. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is marketing debt after it said second-quarter net
income climbed to $4.8 billion, or $1.09 a share, from $2.72
billion, or 28 cents, in the same period a year earlier. The
per-share earnings compared with an average estimate for
adjusted earnings of 71 cents projected by 22 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>There''s probably some appetite, or as good of appetite as
there''s been for financials to potentially come to market, Tom Murphy, who helps oversee more than $20 billion of investment-
grade credit at Columbus Management in Minneapolis, said in a
telephone interview earlier this week. It will be something
very interesting to follow to see if the JPMorgans, the Bank of
Americas, et cetera, decide to do some term-issuance at much
tighter spreads, at much tighter yields. </p>
<p>Bank of America Corp., the largest U.S. bank ranked by
assets, is expected to report earnings tomorrow. </p>
<p>Last Sale </p>
<p>JPMorgan last sold debt on June 17, issuing $1.25 billion
of five-year notes, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
3.4 percent notes priced to yield 3.445 percent, or 145 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data
show. That offering was boosted from $1 billion, the data show.
A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. </p>
<p>Those notes traded yesterday at 101.594 cents on the dollar
to yield 3.049 percent, or 124.1 basis points more than
benchmarks, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is marketing 10-year fixed-rate debt for the first
time since March, when it sold $1.5 billion of the bonds,
Bloomberg data show. The bank will manage today''s offering, the
person familiar said. </p>

<p>Value-at-risk in commodity prices, a measure of how much

<p>JPMorgan bought back $135 million through the end of the

Michael Cavanagh, the New York-based company''s chief executive
officer for Treasury and Security Services, told journalists on

<p>You can assume that we don''t do that without consulting
with our regulators, Cavanagh told reporters on a conference

income to $4.8 billion for the second quarter. It''s a small
amount of buyback activity and I wouldn''t draw too many

<p>U.S. banks, which were directed to raise capital and
restrict dividends following the worst economic crisis since the
Great Depression, have been hesitant to return that money to
shareholders. Dimon said last month that it may be too
ambitious to expect a dividend increase by the end of the
year. Share repurchases may come first because they don''t have
to be sustained like a dividend boost. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. agreed to
waive tax deductions it could have claimed after paying a $550
million penalty in a settlement with U.S. regulators, giving up
as much as $187.5 million in savings. </p>
<p>In yesterday''s settlement with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission, the firm agreed it shall not claim,
assert or apply for a tax deduction for any penalty amounts.
Goldman Sachs will pay a $535 million civil penalty, which
normally would be deductible, and give up $15 million in
profits, which the firm likely can still deduct. </p>
<p>It''s unusual, but not unheard of for companies to forgo
tax deductions when negotiating settlements, said Robert Willens, founder of Robert Willens LLC, a consulting firm that
advises investors on tax and accounting rules. It''s actually
become a little more popular in recent years for the government
to insist that no deduction be taken for any portion of the
payment. </p>
<p>In order to deduct the payments, Goldman Sachs would have
had to argue that a portion were compensatory and would be paid
to third parties rather than the government. Other companies
have argued that position, said Ron Pearlman, a tax law
professor at Georgetown University. </p>
<p>Explicit Prohibition </p>
<p>The settlement explicitly bars the company from claiming
deductions regardless of whether such penalty amounts, or any
part thereof, are added to a distribution fund or otherwise used
for the benefit of investors. </p>
<p>In Goldman Sach''s case, Pearlman said, the company likely
concluded that it would not be good PR if it became known, as it
undoubtedly would, that Goldman Sachs attempted to deduct the
penalty. </p>
<p>Giving up the tax deduction makes the penalty appear
smaller than paying a larger penalty and retaining the
deductions. Had Goldman Sachs agreed to a $1 billion fine and
kept its federal and state deductions, the net outlay would have
been about $600 million. </p>
<p>In the settlement, Goldman Sachs acknowledged that
marketing materials for a 2007 deal at the center of the case
contained incomplete information. The SEC''s suit filed in
April accused the firm of defrauding investors in a mortgage-
backed collateralized debt obligation by failing to tell them
that hedge fund Paulson  Co., which was planning to bet against
the deal, had helped design it. </p>

<p>(Corrects number of units sold in sixth paragraph of story
that ran yesterday.) </p>
<p>U.S. sales of video games fell 6
percent in June to $1.1 billion after the strong appeal of
Nintendo Co., Sony Corp. and Microsoft Corp. consoles failed to
offset weak game purchases. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s Xbox 360 sales gained 88 percent to 451,700
units after it introduced a slimmer version of its console with
a larger hard drive. It was the second-largest non-holiday month
of sales for the Redmond, Washington-based company''s Xbox 360,
behind the September 2007 release of the game Halo 3, research
firm NPD Group said today in a statement. </p>
<p>Nintendo sold 422,500 Wii consoles in the U.S. in June, a
16 percent increase from a year earlier, NPD said. Sales of
Tokyo-based Sony''s PlayStation 3 jumped 85 percent to 304,800
units in June. </p>
<p>Nintendo''s DS handheld video-game player sales fell by a
third after the Kyoto, Japan-based company said it''s introducing
a version equipped with three cameras, a wireless connection and
a screen that displays 3-D images without the use of special
glasses. The company plans to start selling the 3DS player
before March 2011, prompting a 39 percent decline in May. </p>
<p>Games sales fell 15 percent to $531 million, hurt by a
relatively weak lineup of large-franchise titles as game
publishers hold major releases for the second half of the year,
which historically delivers higher sales. </p>
<p>Red Dead Redemption, from New York-based Take-Two
Interactive Software Inc., remained the top-selling video game
for a second month, with 963,000 units purchased for Xbox 360
and PS3, NPD said. Nintendo''s Super Mario Galaxy 2 sold 548,000
units for the Wii. </p>
<p>Sales are more concentrated this year on the top-selling
games, NPD analyst Anita Frazier said in the statement. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s $550
million settlement with U.S. regulators yesterday will benefit
the firm by ending three months of uncertainty at an affordable
price. Now the rest of Wall Street begins calculating the cost. </p>
<p>Investors welcomed the deal with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, saying the company won key points: The cost
was below some analysts'' estimates of at least $1 billion; no
management changes were required; and Goldman Sachs said the SEC
indicated it doesn''t plan claims related to other mortgage-
linked securities it examined. The stock''s late surge on
anticipation of a settlement yesterday added more than $3
billion to the company''s market value, and it climbed further
after New York trading closed. </p>
<p>You''d have to look at it as a victory for Goldman, said
Peter Sorrentino, senior portfolio manager at Huntington Asset
Advisors in Cincinnati, which manages $13.3 billion including
Goldman Sachs shares. This takes a cloud off the stock. </p>
<p>In the settlement, unveiled less than two hours after the
Senate passed legislation to reform the financial system and
avert future crises, Goldman Sachs acknowledged that marketing
materials for the 2007 deal at the center of the case contained
incomplete information. In its April 16 suit, the SEC
accused the firm of defrauding investors in a mortgage-backed
collateralized debt obligation by failing to tell them that
hedge fund Paulson  Co., which was planning to bet against the
deal, had helped to design it. </p>
<p>One of the Worst Days'' </p>
<p>In its original public response, Goldman Sachs had called
the SEC''s case unfounded in law and fact and maintained that
it made all disclosures about the CDOs that should be material
to the sophisticated investors who lost money on the deal.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, who said
the day the suit was filed was one of the worst days in my
professional life, said in May that the bank established a
committee to review the firm''s business standards. </p>
<p>The settlement requires the New York-based company to
increase training for employees who structure or market mortgage
securities, and to bolster the vetting and approval process.
Those changes will probably lead to a new industry standard for
disclosures in private sales of securities, even to the most
sophisticated investors, analysts said. </p>
<p>All of the firms are going to adjust their internal
standards for this, Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein  Co. in New York, said in an interview. The agreement
means a private placement doesn''t absolve you from the
accuracy of the disclosure and you''d better have very, very good
compliance watching what your sales people are saying. </p>
<p>Best Practices'' </p>
<p>Robert Khuzami, the SEC''s director of enforcement, said at
a news conference yesterday that his agency means to send a
signal to the entire industry. </p>
<p>We would strongly encourage other institutions to adopt
any kinds of best practices that they see across the street in
order to prevent this kind of wrongdoing, said Khuzami, 53.
The deterrence, and preventing a fraud before it occurs, is a
much better outcome than picking up the pieces afterwards. </p>
<p>The SEC is still investigating other companies and a range
of products that fueled losses during the financial crisis,
Khuzami said. Last month, the agency sued New York-based ICP
Asset Management LLC on claims that it improperly traded assets
in CDOs it managed. ICP has denied wrongdoing. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs said in a statement that the SEC doesn''t plan
to target the firm over any other products that the agency has
reviewed. </p>
<p>Case Against Tourre </p>
<p>We understand that the SEC staff also has completed a
review of a number of other Goldman Sachs mortgage-related CDO
transactions and does not anticipate recommending any claims
against Goldman Sachs or any of its employees, the firm said. </p>
<p>The SEC''s case continues against Fabrice Tourre, the only
Goldman Sachs employee the agency sued over the CDO. Tourre, 31,
is due to respond to the complaint by July 19. He told a Senate
subcommittee in April that he categorically denies the SEC''s
allegations and will fight them in court. </p>
<p>The SEC''s deputy enforcement director, Lorin Reisner, said
Goldman Sachs agreed to cooperate in the case against Tourre,
who is on leave and whose legal expenses are being paid by the
company. Tourre''s attorney, Pamela Chepiga at Allen  Overy LLP,
didn''t reply to an e-mail and phone message. </p>
<p>Blankfein, 55, and the firm''s other senior managers may not
emerge from the SEC case unscathed, even if they weren''t forced
to resign. </p>
<p>Repair Their Reputation'' </p>
<p>Within a decent interval, you''re probably going to see a
new CEO, said Christopher Whalen, a New York Federal Reserve
official in the 1980s and co-founder of Institutional Risk
Analytics, in an interview on Bloomberg Television. They still
have a lot of work to do with clients and may face claims and
litigation going forward, and they have to repair their
reputation. </p>
<p>William Cohan, an author and former investment banker who
is writing a book about Goldman Sachs, said that Blankfein''s
position is secure for the foreseeable future. Cohan expects
the next CEO will come from an investment banking background
rather than trading, the business drawing regulators'' scrutiny. </p>
<p>I will predict that this is the last trading-oriented CEO
of Goldman Sachs for a while, Cohan said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television. </p>
<p>SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro, 55, has previously denied
speculation that the lawsuit was filed to support financial-
reform legislation backed by President Barack Obama by casting
Goldman Sachs, the most profitable securities firm in Wall
Street history, as a villain. There was absolutely no
consideration to the bill, Khuzami told reporters, hours after
the bill cleared the Senate. Still, the timing raised some
eyebrows. </p>
<p>Highly Suspicious'' </p>
<p>It is highly suspicious, and it makes the SEC now look
like it is totally politicized, said Paul Atkins, a former
Republican SEC commissioner who is now a financial services
consultant. </p>
<p>While the SEC touted the $550 million settlement as the
largest it ever levied against a Wall Street firm, it fell short
of some analysts'' estimates for a $1 billion fine. Hintz, who
estimated the agreement will shave 93 cents from the firm''s
earnings, said he had predicted it would cost $1.05 per share. </p>
<p>For Goldman Sachs, the cost represents about 14
days'' worth of earnings, based on first-quarter profit.
Blankfein, who was awarded a record-setting $67.9 million bonus
for 2007, has stock in the firm that''s worth almost $490
million, based on the firm''s last proxy statement. </p>
<p>Shares Gain </p>
<p>The SEC''s disclosure yesterday that it planned a
significant announcement fueled speculation that a deal was
imminent, sending the firm''s shares up 4.4 percent to $145.22 at
the end of New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock,
which had lost more than 20 percent since the suit was filed, is
likely to rise further, said Hintz. </p>
<p>I''m jumping up and down and telling my dad to buy it,
Hintz said of Goldman Sachs''s stock. </p>
<p>Bank of America Merrill Lynch said it upgraded its rating
on Goldman Sachs to buy in a note to clients following the
agreement yesterday. </p>
<p>The settlement is palatable and the probability of
further action against Goldman Sachs is much lower, said
analysts led by New York-based Guy Moszkowski in the note. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs rose 5.1 percent to $152.59 at 9:50 a.m. in
German trading. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp., the world''s biggest computer-services company, fell in
late trading after the company reported revenue that missed
analysts'' estimates and a decline in services-contract signings. </p>
<p>Revenue last quarter rose 2 percent to $23.7 billion, the
Armonk, New York-based company said today. Analysts on average
estimated $24.2 billion, according to a Bloomberg survey.
Currency fluctuations reduced sales by $500 million, IBM said. </p>
<p>Services signings declined 12 percent to $12.3 billion,
suggesting corporate customers are delaying projects even as the
economy recovers. It''s the second straight quarterly decline in
contracts for services, which makes up more than half of IBM''s
total revenue. Shares fell as much 4.3 percent in late trading. </p>
<p>Investors simply want to see a bit more in terms of
revenue and bookings, said Andy Miedler, a St. Louis-based
analyst at Edward Jones who rates the shares buy. The
market is in show-me'' mode. You can''t just tell us you''re going
to do this. </p>
<p>IBM also boosted its full-year profit forecast to at least
$11.25 a share, missing analysts'' average estimate of $11.28.
The company had previously projected profit of at least $11.20. </p>
<p>Signings declined last quarter as many customers didn''t
renew contract extensions while some clients put off closing
contracts until the current quarter, Chief Financial Officer
Mark Loughridge said on a conference call. </p>
<p>Loughridge cautioned against viewing the results as a sign
of a pullback in spending. The rollover of deals into the
current quarter should accelerate performance in the
outsourcing signings, he said. </p>
<p>Shares Fall </p>
<p>IBM fell as much as $5.59 to $124.20 in extended trading
after reporting the results. The stock closed at $129.79 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading and has lost less than 1
percent this year. </p>
<p>IBM gets almost a third of its revenue from Europe, whose
currency fell 9.4 percent against the dollar last quarter.
Although the impact from foreign-exchange rates was anticipated,
not all analysts took it into account with their estimates, said
Deutsche Bank AG analyst Chris Whitmore. </p>
<p>It''s going to be a headwind, said San Francisco-based
Whitmore, who rates the shares buy and doesn''t own them. </p>
<p>Net income climbed to $3.39 billion, or $2.61 a share,
compared with $3.1 billion, or $2.32, a year earlier. Analysts
estimated earnings of $2.58 a share. </p>
<p>Currency fluctuations hurt profit by about 10 cents to 11
cents, Loughridge said on the call. IBM also said it would
introduce its new mainframe computer, part of its System z
series, this week. </p>
<p>Acquisition Outlook </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano expects IBM to almost
double operating earnings to $20 per share by 2015, as he
continues to focus on more profitable software and services
businesses. The software segment, the company''s most profitable,
will make up about half of total profit in five years, Palmisano
has said. </p>
<p>Palmisano plans to make about $20 billion in acquisitions
in the timeframe. IBM is investing in markets such as analytics
software, which helps companies predict trends, and cloud
computing, which lets them store and access information on
shared servers. The company is also developing services to
monitor highways, electrical grids and other infrastructures to
help them run more efficiently. </p>
<p>Increased sales of those technologies, along with growth
markets such as Brazil and China, will add $20 billion to
revenue by 2015, IBM has said. </p>

<p>Fabrice Tourre, the Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. executive director sued by the Securities and
Exchange Commission for fraud, disputed regulators'' allegations
in a filing today. </p>
<p>Tourre in his filing today in federal court in Manhattan
denied wrongdoing and said he was aware that hedge fund Paulson
 Co. was considering taking some or all of the short side
of a transaction involving the 2007 sale of a collateralized
debt obligation called Abacus 2007-AC1 that was linked to
subprime mortgages. </p>
<p>Tourre responded four days after Goldman Sachs, the most
profitable securities firm in Wall Street history, agreed to
settle its role in the case for $550 million. The firm also will
cooperate in the SEC''s investigation of Tourre, 31, who remains
an employee. Tourre is on leave and his legal expenses are being
paid by New York-based Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>The purported claims against Mr. Tourre and the
allegations upon which they are based are improperly vague,
ambiguous and confusing, and omit critical facts, the filing
said. Mr. Tourre, a French citizen and engineer by training,
reasonably relied on Goldman Sachs'' institutional process to
ensure adequate legal review and disclosure of material
information, and cannot be held liable for any alleged failings
of that process. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. sued the Texas
Rangers, claiming the bankrupt baseball team breached the terms
of a loan by taking over the lease for its stadium, Rangers
Ballpark. </p>
<p>Transferring the lease to Texas Rangers Baseball Partners
made it harder for lenders to collect at least $411 million owed
by the team''s owner, Tom Hicks''s HSG Sports Group LLC, JPMorgan
said in a lawsuit filed July 16 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Fort
Worth, Texas. </p>
<p>When HSG borrowed the money, it agreed that certain units
and affiliates would help pay back the loan if necessary,
according to court papers. The HSG unit that controlled the
lease was obligated to repay the full amount while Texas Rangers
Baseball Partners was liable only for $75 million, New York-
based JPMorgan said in court documents. </p>
<p>After filing for bankruptcy in May, the Rangers, based in
Arlington, Texas, sought court permission to sell the club to a
group led by Hall of Fame pitcher and team President Nolan Ryan
and attorney Chuck Greenberg in a transaction valued at more
than $500 million. </p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge D. Michael Lynn ordered the team put
up for auction on Aug. 4, with the Ryan-Greenberg group acting
as the lead bidders. Afterward, he will consider approving the
company''s bankruptcy exit plan, which details how the money
generated from a sale would pay creditors. </p>
<p>July 28 Deadline </p>
<p>Creditors have until July 28 to vote on the plan, which
means they won''t know the outcome of auction when they cast
their ballots. Lynn must take those votes into consideration
when deciding whether to approve the bankruptcy exit plan. </p>
<p>Lenders, led by JPMorgan, oppose the sale, arguing that it
doesn''t give competitors time to prepare. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the agent for investors who loaned the money to
HSG, asked the judge to declare the transfer null and void
because it violated the mortgage on the property. The lease on
the stadium in Arlington, Texas, is collateral for the loan,
according to court documents. </p>
<p>Mark Semer, a spokesman for the Rangers, declined to
comment. </p>
<p>The case is In re Texas Rangers Baseball Partners, 10-
43400, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas (Fort
Worth). </p>

<p>The U.S. economy faces a period of
protracted sluggishness as consumers are wary to spend, said
Stephen Roach, Morgan Stanley''s chairman for Asia. </p>
<p>The U.S. is, I think, in the early stages of what is a
very protracted sluggishness of domestic internal demand,
Roach, who is also a professor at Yale University, said in a
radio interview with Tom Keene and Ken Prewitt on Bloomberg
Surveillance. </p>
<p>The U.S. economy grew at a 2.7 percent annual rate in the
first quarter, less than previously calculated, reflecting a
smaller gain in consumer spending and a bigger trade gap, data
showed last month. Consumer confidence slumped in July to the
lowest level in a year, signaling that the biggest part of the
economy is losing momentum, according to the Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of consumer
sentiment published on July 16. </p>
<p>The dynamism that we''ve gotten hooked and accustomed to,
is just not going to be there, Roach said. </p>
<p>The U.S. housing market took another step back in June as
construction and purchases dropped, and a gauge of the outlook
for growth signaled the expansion will lose steam, economists
said before data due to be published later this week. Housing''s
inability to maintain a rebound is one reason the economic
recovery is not gaining speed. </p>
<p>Stimulus Debate </p>
<p>President Barack Obama said on July 15 that his economic-
stimulus program is gradually pulling the U.S. out of its
deepest recession in decades. Republicans have said the stimulus
is wasteful, hasn''t reduced unemployment and has added to the
record budget deficit. </p>
<p>The president is walking a fine line between stimulus
and budget cuts, Roach said. What the markets are ultimately
going to want is far more specificity and credibility on deficit
reduction and normalization of Fed policy. Federal Reserve
policy makers last month restated a pledge to keep the benchmark
lending rate at around zero for an extended period. </p>
<p>Roach also said that the savings rate in China, one of the
biggest buyers of U.S. debt, is still high and rising. It is a
savings rate driven more by fear than by life-cycle rational
motives, if you deal with that fear, you can reduce that excess
saving, he said. </p>
<p>Reducing savings may boost Chinese domestic demand, helping
the country to cope with weak exports to Europe and the U.S.,
where demand fell following the recession. China has depended on
exports to the U.S. and Europe to fuel its economic growth over
the past decades. </p>
<p>China''s Model </p>
<p>China has to shift the model if it wants to continue to
maintain rapid growth and avoid social instability, and focus on
deriving support from internal private consumption, Roach
said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley cut its full-year economic growth forecast
for China by about 1 percentage point to around 10 percent.
Roach expects economic growth will hold at around 10 percent
over the next couple of years. </p>
<p>Per capita gross domestic product in China is still a
real laggard, he said. It will take China at least 50 years
before China''s gross domestic product per capita catches up to
anything close to that of the developed world, he said. </p>

<p>A surge in imports and slower
consumer spending reduced U.S. economic growth in the second
quarter, according to economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>The world''s largest economy grew at a 2 percent annual pace
from April through June, down from a previously estimated 3
percent pace, according to revised estimates by Goldman
economists. Forecasts for the second half of the year remained
at an average 1.5 percent pending the government''s annual
revisions to gross domestic product due July 30. </p>
<p>At that point, we may need to make downward revisions,
judging from the relentless run on disappointments in recent
weeks, Ed McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs in New
York wrote in a July 16 note to clients. While it is
conceivable that the slowdown will prove fleeting, several
factors strongly suggest otherwise. </p>
<p>Among the issues that will damp growth in the second half
are the loss of support from fiscal stimulus and inventory
replenishment, the excess supply of vacant housing, state and
local budget constraints, a lack of credit, and weak employment
gains, McKelvey said. </p>
<p>The cut in the growth forecast follows similar reductions
by economists at JPMorgan Chase  Co. and UBS Securities LLC in
New York. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said
second-quarter profit dropped 82 percent, missing analysts''
estimates on a slide in trading revenue five days after settling
U.S. regulators'' fraud allegations. </p>
<p>Net income fell to $613 million, or 78 cents a share, from
$3.44 billion, or $4.93, a year earlier, New York-based Goldman
Sachs said in a statement today. The average estimate of 21
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for earnings of $1.99 per
share, with estimates ranging from 77 cents to $4.34. Some of
the analysts didn''t include costs of the settlement. </p>
<p>Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs''s chairman and chief
executive officer, is working to restore the firm''s reputation
after agreeing to pay $550 million to settle the Securities and
Exchange Commission''s fraud accusations. The bank''s bigger
competitors, including JPMorgan Chase  Co., last week also
reported lower trading revenue as market gyrations reduced
clients'' willingness to take on risk. Concern that the U.S.
economic rebound will stall and reform legislation will crimp
profits at finance companies have weighed on their stocks. </p>
<p>The clouds over the financial industry remain thick,
said Michael Farr, president and founder of Washington-based
Farr, Miller  Washington LLC, who manages more than $650
million. Farr, who sold his Goldman Sachs stock when the SEC
suit was filed on April 16, said he''s considering buying again. </p>
<p>You''ve got probably the greatest, most innovative
investment bank in the world, leading the category, which looks
cheap, Farr said before earnings were released. I have not
put my money back in yet but I am taking a close look at doing
just that. </p>
<p>Share Performance </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs fell 49 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $145.68 in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, leaving the
stock down 14 percent this year through yesterday. The SP 500
Financials Index, which tracks the performance of 80 financial
company shares, is down 2 percent this year. </p>
<p>The company''s shares rebounded last week on news that the
firm had reached a settlement with the SEC over its 2007 sale of
a collateralized debt obligation. The cost was lower than the $1
billion some analysts had estimated and the settlement didn''t
require any management changes. Analysts slashed earnings
estimates in recent weeks on concern market declines would hurt
trading revenue as well as on costs related to the settlement
and a one-time bonus tax imposed in the U.K. </p>
<p>People have gotten overly pessimistic on Goldman,
Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales Partners LLC, said
before the earnings were released. We don''t believe they''ve
lost big chunks of their client base, and we do believe in their
risk-management capabilities. </p>
<p>Bank of America </p>
<p>Shares in some of Goldman Sachs''s biggest rivals fell last
week after they reported revenue that was lower than investors
predicted. JPMorgan Chase''s second-quarter net revenue dropped 9
percent from the first quarter as revenue at the investment bank
unit slid 24 percent. Bank of America Corp.''s revenue fell 9
percent as global banking and markets revenue tumbled 38
percent. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, which was the second-biggest securities
firm after Goldman Sachs before both converted to banks in 2008,
is due to report earnings tomorrow. </p>
<p>Investors and analysts said before the earnings that
they''re keen for news on how the settlement, which imposes
changes to the way Goldman Sachs sells mortgage-related
securities, and the wider financial regulatory reform bill
passed by the U.S. Senate last week will affect earnings. </p>
<p>I do think there will actually be business reforms where
their risk taking might be reined in, said Portales Partners
LLC''s Peabody. I don''t think there''s any question that Goldman
did play in the grey areas and curbing that reduces your
opportunities. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the bank
that makes the most trading equities, lost money in the second
quarter by betting on a drop in stock-market volatility just as
a gauge of equity-price swings surged to a one-year high. </p>
<p>Primarily in response to our client needs, our equity
derivatives business was short volatility entering the second
quarter and posted poor results, Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said on a conference call with reporters today. The firm
didn''t break out the size of the loss or the overall results
from the equity derivatives group responsible for the business. </p>
<p>The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or the
VIX, is the most widely used measure of volatility. The index,
which started the second quarter at 17.47, rose as high as 45.79
on May 20 before ending the quarter at 34.54. The index, which
measures the cost of using options as insurance against declines
in the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index, has averaged 20.38 over its
two-decade history. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs said the division''s revenue slumped 62
percent in the second quarter from a year earlier to $1.21
billion. Still, the unit''s revenue beat equities divisions at
JPMorgan Chase  Co., Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp.
in the quarter. </p>
<p>Volatility Just Spiked'' </p>
<p>Clients wanted to hedge against an increase in volatility,
Viniar said on the call. We took the other side because you
know we deal with our clients all the time, he said. We had
that position going into the quarter and volatility just
spiked. </p>
<p>The client demand described by Viniar seems to indicate
that clients took the opposite tack of the one recommended by
Goldman Sachs''s own economics and strategy team. In a Dec. 2,
2009, note about Goldman Sachs''s top trades for 2010, the
first recommendation made to clients is that they hold short
positions in so-called variance swaps as a way of betting on
falling volatility. </p>
<p>Even in a sluggish recovery and a range-bound equity
market, as macro-driven uncertainty declines, volatility can
continue to moderate, the note said. </p>
<p>Risks Not Offset </p>
<p>Some investors and analysts expressed surprise that Goldman
Sachs, which prides itself on its risk-management success,
didn''t have positions that could hedge any losses. </p>
<p>I would think they''d try to hedge out and offset those
risks, said Benjamin Wallace, an analyst at Grimes  Co. in
Westborough, Massachusetts, which manages $800 million and
doesn''t hold Goldman Sachs stock. </p>
<p>Roger Freeman, an analyst at Barclays Capital in New York,
asked Viniar on a call with investors today why the firm didn''t
have any hedges against the jump in volatility. </p>
<p>I would say we didn''t hedge it fast enough, Viniar
replied. Things spiked really dramatically really fast. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which set a Wall Street profit record for a
U.S. securities firm in 2007, reported today that second-quarter
profit tumbled 82 percent from a year earlier as revenue from
trading equities as well as fixed-income, currencies and
commodities dropped 44 percent from a year earlier. The stock
rose 2.2 percent to $148.91 as of 6:10 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. </p>
<p>Viniar said the firm reduced the size of its market bets
during the quarter to the lowest in three years as measured by
value-at-risk. VaR, a statistical measure of how much the firm
could lose in a single day of trading, dropped to an average of
$136 million in the quarter from $161 million in the first
quarter and $245 million a year earlier. </p>
<p>It''s kind of hard to fault them for being wrong every now
and then, said Alan Villalon, a senior research analyst at FAF
Advisors, which owns Goldman Sachs shares. They''ve kept
raising the bar themselves, but there''s going to be a hiccup
every now and then. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp., the world''s biggest computer-services company, slid in
New York trading after missing analysts'' sales estimates and
reporting a drop in services-contract signings. </p>
<p>Revenue last quarter rose 2 percent to $23.7 billion, IBM
said. Analysts on average estimated $24.2 billion, according to
a Bloomberg survey. Currency fluctuations reduced sales by $500
million, the company said. </p>
<p>Services-contract signings declined 12 percent to $12.3
billion, the Armonk, New York-based company said, for the second
straight quarterly drop. </p>
<p>The market doesn''t want to hear words -- it wants to see
results, said Edward Jones analyst Andy Miedler, who rates the
shares buy, citing earnings growth. </p>
<p>IBM''s outlook remains healthy, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on a conference call. Signings declined last
quarter because many customers didn''t extend contracts and some
clients put off signing them until this quarter, he said. IBM
actually increased new business signings, he said. </p>
<p>I don''t think I would take this and interpret it as a
reflection that there''s a pullback in spending, Loughridge
said. The rollover of deals should accelerate performance. </p>
<p>Outsourcing signings should have double-digit percentage
growth in this quarter, Loughridge said. Services growth, as
well as software revenue and new hardware products, will help
IBM raise total sales this quarter even with a currency impact,
he said. </p>
<p>Forecast Boost </p>
<p>IBM boosted its full-year profit forecast to at least
$11.25 a share, missing analysts'' average estimate of $11.28.
The company had previously projected profit of at least $11.20. </p>
<p>Net income for the quarter climbed 9.4 percent to $3.39
billion, or $2.61 a share, topping analysts'' average estimate of
$2.58 a share. </p>
<p>The company gets almost a third of its revenue from Europe,
whose currency fell 9.4 percent against the dollar last quarter.
Although the impact from foreign-exchange rates was anticipated,
not all analysts took it into account with their estimates, said
Deutsche Bank AG analyst Chris Whitmore. </p>
<p>It''s going to be a headwind, said San Francisco-based
Whitmore, who rates the shares buy and doesn''t own them. </p>
<p>Currency fluctuations hurt profit by about 10 cents to 11
cents a share, Loughridge said on the call. IBM also said it
would introduce its new mainframe computer, part of its System z
series, this week. </p>
<p>2015 Outlook </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano expects IBM to almost
double operating earnings to $20 per share by 2015, as he
continues to focus on more lucrative software and services
businesses. The software segment, the company''s most profitable,
will make up about half of total earnings in five years,
Palmisano has said. </p>
<p>Palmisano plans to make about $20 billion in acquisitions
in that period. IBM is investing in markets such as analytics
software, which helps companies predict trends, and cloud
computing, which lets them store and access information on
shared servers. The company is also developing services to
monitor highways, electrical grids and other infrastructure to
help these systems run more efficiently. </p>
<p>Increased sales of those technologies, along with growth
markets such as Brazil and China, will add $20 billion to
revenue by 2015, IBM has said. </p>
<p>IBM also announced a shuffling of management duties at the
company yesterday, in an e-mail distributed to employees. Four
top executives will take on additional responsibilities as
Palmisano nears 60, the usual retirement age for the company''s
CEOs. </p>
<p>The company fell $3.24, or 2.5 percent, to $126.55 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have dropped 3.3 percent this year. </p>

<p>General Atomics Aeronautical Systems
Inc. said it won U.S. approval for an export version of the
Predator drone, clearing the way for the first sales of the
unmanned aircraft in the Middle East. </p>
<p>There''s interest from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and
the United Arab Emirates, Frank Pace, president of the
aircraft systems group at the closely held company, said today
in an interview at the Farnborough Air Show near London. </p>
<p>General Atomics recently received U.S. State Department
approval to offer an unarmed Predator model to countries beyond
the NATO bloc, Japan, Australia and New Zealand, Pace said. That
would allow sales in the Middle East and elsewhere to
governments previously ineligible to buy the planes, he said. </p>
<p>U.S. Predators are now used to monitor and strike targets
in Iraq, Afghanistan and the border areas of Pakistan. Selling
the aircraft to countries in the Middle East may ease regional
opposition to the surveillance while raising new issues related
to how the buyers fly them, one analyst said. </p>
<p>There could be an argument that if the countries do it
themselves, it''s less intrusive, William Hartung, an analyst
at the New America Foundation, a Washington research group, said
in a phone interview. But there''s still a question of how this
capability is used. </p>
<p>For example, a Pakistani Predator that was sent to monitor
neighboring India would be problematic because such a
mission might not be in U.S. interests, Hartung said. </p>
<p>Predator Capabilities </p>
<p>Predators are popular with U.S. military and intelligence
agencies because they''re smaller than manned planes and can
loiter over a target for long periods without risk to a pilot.
Missile-equipped Predators can mount attacks via remote control. </p>
<p>General Atomics see the potential for sales of as many as
100 units in the Middle East and Pakistan of the so-called
Predator XP model approved for export, Pace said. </p>
<p>Saudi Arabia is a huge country, and if they want to cover
the country well, they alone could get 50 aircraft, Pace said. </p>
<p>General Atomics, based in Poway, California, has sold about
435 Predator-series drones, mostly to the U.S. government,
according to spokeswoman Kimberly Kasitz. That total includes
about 25 sold to NATO countries, Japan, Australia and New
Zealand, Kasitz said. The export model also is being promoted in
South America and Mexico, she said. </p>
<p>That version, based on the model used by the U.S. Army and
the Air Force, will lack the ability to carry weapons and will
be designed only for surveillance and reconnaissance missions,
Pace said. </p>
<p>Predators range in price from about $4 million for the
basic model to about $15 million for the so-called Avenger
version, Kasitz said. </p>
<p>General Atomics also builds the Predator B model with
extended range and a new Predator C, the Avenger, that can evade
enemy radar. Boeing Co., Northrop Grumman Corp. and Lockheed
Martin Corp. also make unmanned aerial vehicles used by the U.S.
military for surveillance and armed missions. </p>

<p>David Viniar, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc.''s chief financial officer, said he''s not aware of any
discussions about changing the chief executive officer or
chief operating officer after the firm agreed to a record-
setting settlement with U.S. regulators. </p>
<p>Some investors and analysts have speculated that CEO Lloyd Blankfein, 55, and Gary Cohn, 49, who serves as president and
COO, may step down in coming months as the New York-based
company attempts to overcome reputational damage from the
Securities and Exchange Commission''s fraud lawsuit. </p>
<p>They must know something I don''t, Viniar, 55, said in a
telephone interview today after the bank reported an 82 percent
drop in second-quarter profit. He added that obviously I
wouldn''t tell you if we were having board discussions about
those things. </p>
<p>Christopher Whalen, a former Federal Reserve Bank of New
York official and co-founder of Institutional Risk Analytics,
said after the settlement last week that Blankfein would
probably leave within a decent interval in order to help
repair the company''s reputation. </p>
<p>Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales Partners LLC, said
last week that he expects Blankfein and Cohn to be gone before
the end of next year. </p>
<p>They will choose a time where they can exit in a manner
that it''s not tied to the SEC issue and in a manner where they
can walk out with good news on their hip, Peabody said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which has lost 12 percent on the New York
Stock Exchange this year, gained $2.70 to $148.38 in composite
trading at 2:27 p.m. </p>
<p>Partner Departures </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which had about 400 partners after the firm
last named new members to the partnership in 2008, will probably
see defections before the end of the year because 15 percent to
20 percent of the partners leave every two years, Viniar said.
He estimated that about half of the 60 or 80 partners that would
be expected to leave have already gone. </p>
<p>There are going to be partners who retire, Viniar said.
I don''t know who they are, there''s no one who''s being talked
about, there''s no one who''s talking about it. But I am sure that
between now and the end of the year there will be partners who
retire. </p>
<p>The amount of money set aside for compensation in the first
half of the year dropped 18 percent even as the total number of
employees climbed 9 percent. </p>
<p>New Legislation </p>
<p>The firm hasn''t had any large amounts of people leaving
because of new legislation that will affect businesses including
proprietary trading and the special-situations unit, Viniar
said. </p>
<p>That doesn''t mean it won''t happen in the future but we''re
not seeing it now, he said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs agreed last week to pay $550 million to
settle the SEC''s April 16 lawsuit, which accused the firm of
defrauding investors in a collateralized debt obligation sold in
2007. A new financial regulation law that was passed by the U.S.
Senate last week will probably force changes on Goldman Sachs''s
derivatives-trading business and divisions that invest the
company''s own money. </p>
<p>Viniar, who joined Goldman Sachs in 1980, said he remains
happy at the firm. I am here because I love Goldman Sachs and
I love what I do, he said. </p>

<p>The failed boiler, the main generator of steam at the site,

<p>The refinery has the capacity to process 190,000 barrels of

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said
second-quarter profit dropped 82 percent, missing analysts''
estimates on a slide in trading revenue five days after settling
U.S. regulators'' fraud allegations. </p>
<p>Net income fell to $613 million, or 78 cents a share, from
$3.44 billion, or $4.93, a year earlier, New York-based Goldman
Sachs said in a statement today. The average estimate of 21
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for earnings of $1.99 per
share, with estimates ranging from 77 cents to $4.34. Some of
the analysts didn''t include costs of the settlement. </p>
<p>Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs''s chairman and chief
executive officer, is working to restore the firm''s reputation
after agreeing to pay $550 million to settle the Securities and
Exchange Commission''s fraud accusations. The bank''s bigger
competitors, including JPMorgan Chase  Co., last week also
reported lower trading revenue as market gyrations reduced
clients'' willingness to take on risk. Concern that the U.S.
economic rebound will stall and reform legislation will crimp
profits at finance companies have weighed on their stocks. </p>
<p>The clouds over the financial industry remain thick,
said Michael Farr, president and founder of Washington-based
Farr, Miller  Washington LLC, who manages more than $650
million. Farr, who sold his Goldman Sachs stock when the SEC
suit was filed on April 16, said he''s considering buying again. </p>
<p>You''ve got probably the greatest, most innovative
investment bank in the world, leading the category, which looks
cheap, Farr said before earnings were released. I have not
put my money back in yet but I am taking a close look at doing
just that. </p>
<p>Share Performance </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs fell 49 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $145.68 in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, leaving the
stock down 14 percent this year through yesterday. The SP 500
Financials Index, which tracks the performance of 80 financial
company shares, is down 2 percent this year. </p>
<p>The company''s shares rebounded last week on news that the
firm had reached a settlement with the SEC over its 2007 sale of
a collateralized debt obligation. The cost was lower than the $1
billion some analysts had estimated and the settlement didn''t
require any management changes. Analysts slashed earnings
estimates in recent weeks on concern market declines would hurt
trading revenue as well as on costs related to the settlement
and a one-time bonus tax imposed in the U.K. </p>
<p>People have gotten overly pessimistic on Goldman,
Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales Partners LLC, said
before the earnings were released. We don''t believe they''ve
lost big chunks of their client base, and we do believe in their
risk-management capabilities. </p>
<p>Bank of America </p>
<p>Shares in some of Goldman Sachs''s biggest rivals fell last
week after they reported revenue that was lower than investors
predicted. JPMorgan Chase''s second-quarter net revenue dropped 9
percent from the first quarter as revenue at the investment bank
unit slid 24 percent. Bank of America Corp.''s revenue fell 9
percent as global banking and markets revenue tumbled 38
percent. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, which was the second-biggest securities
firm after Goldman Sachs before both converted to banks in 2008,
is due to report earnings tomorrow. </p>
<p>Investors and analysts said before the earnings that
they''re keen for news on how the settlement, which imposes
changes to the way Goldman Sachs sells mortgage-related
securities, and the wider financial regulatory reform bill
passed by the U.S. Senate last week will affect earnings. </p>
<p>I do think there will actually be business reforms where
their risk taking might be reined in, said Portales Partners
LLC''s Peabody. I don''t think there''s any question that Goldman
did play in the grey areas and curbing that reduces your
opportunities. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley is selling as much as
10 million euros ($12.9 million) of eight-year structured notes
that are linked to euro-area interest rates. </p>
<p>The bonds pay a fixed 4.5 percent coupon in the first year,
which steps up by 0.25 percentage point in years two, three and
four, according to the term sheet. In the final four years, the
securities pay eight times the difference between the two-year
and 30-year euro swap rate up to a maximum 8 percent. </p>
<p>Bonds linked to swaps allow investors to bet on the future
direction of interest rates. Morgan Stanley''s notes perform best
the more the 30-year swap rate, the cost of exchanging fixed for
floating interest payments, is above the two-year rate. </p>
<p>The product is for retail investors interested in the
possibility of high coupons in a low interest-rate
environment, said Joern Schiemann, a vice president at Morgan
Stanley''s derivatives solution group for Germany and Austria. </p>
<p>The 30-year swap rate is 3.29 percent and the two-year rate
is 1.42 percent. The coupon has a zero percent floor so if
short-term rates rise above longer-dated ones, or invert,
investors won''t incur a loss on their principle. </p>
<p>The difference between two-year and 30-year swap rates has
averaged 1.34 percentage points in the past 10 years, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. By 2015, the two-year rate will
be about 0.04 percentage point more than the 30-year rate,
according to the forward rate curve. </p>
<p>If we enter a rate hiking cycle in three years the curve
will flatten, said Matteo Regesta, an interest-rate strategist
at BNP Paribas SA in London. Investors may be enticed by the
huge yields of this product in the short-term, which they can
lock in, while they could lose in the longer-term. In that
respect, the eight times leveraging factor provides a cushion to
such risk. </p>
<p>The initial target issuance size may be increased,
depending on investor demand, according to Morgan Stanley. The
deal is the third series of Interest Expander notes sold by
the bank and will be listed on Germany''s Frankfurt and Stuttgart
stock exchanges. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp., the world''s largest computer-services provider, shuffled
its top management as Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano
nears 60, the usual retirement age for that position. </p>
<p>Senior Vice President Mike Daniels, who heads technology
services, will now lead the consulting business as well,
Palmisano said in an internal memo sent to IBM employees
yesterday and obtained by Bloomberg News. Ginni Rometty, also a
senior vice president, will lead marketing and strategy, in
addition to her position as head of sales. </p>
<p>The restructuring could point to succession plans at IBM.
Three of IBM''s last four chief executives have stepped down at
60, and Palmisano, who has led the company for more than eight
years, will hit that mark next July. Daniels and Rometty have
been cited by analysts and former employees as two likely
candidates for the top spot. </p>
<p>Steve Mills, who''s headed the software group for a decade,
will take on the hardware division as well. Mills, while well-
respected for helping increase profitability in IBM''s software
division, may be unlikely to take over the top post since he
also turns 60 next year. </p>
<p>Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge will now also
oversee IBM''s financing division as well as its own information
technology, according to the memo. </p>
<p>Over the past several years we have seen great value in
working collaboratively, Palmisano said in the memo. Today''s
changes have that in common - they will further strengthen
teaming in support of our strategies and initiatives. </p>
<p>IBM spokesman Edward Barbini, who confirmed the existence
of the e-mail, declined to comment further. </p>
<p>IBM Succession </p>
<p>IBM has brought in a CEO from outside the company only
once, when it named Louis V. Gerstner Jr. to succeed John Akers
in 1993. Akers, who was forced out by IBM''s board, was the only
one of IBM''s last four chief executives to leave before 60. </p>
<p>For the last CEO change, IBM made the succession path clear
more than a year before Gerstner stepped aside. The company
appointed Palmisano, then head of the server business, president
and chief operating officer in September 2000. The formal CEO
announcement came in January 2002, and Gerstner stepped down
from the position March 1, on his 60th birthday. Gerstner
remained chairman through the end of 2002 before Palmisano
assumed that title. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc., the drugmaker cutting
costs after buying Wyeth, agreed to sell a New York skyscraper
to TIAA-CREF, said two people with knowledge of the transaction. </p>
<p>The deal for 685 Third Ave. in Midtown sets the price at
$180 million to $190 million, one of the people said. Both
declined to be identified because the transaction isn''t
complete. </p>
<p>The deal would be at least the seventh for a Manhattan
skyscraper in the past three months, showing increased
confidence among buyers that the city''s office market may have
reached bottom. U.S. commercial real estate prices rose for the
second straight month in May, Moody''s Investors Service said
yesterday. </p>
<p>That reflects the demand and competition, Robert Bach,
chief economist for Grubb  Ellis Co., a Santa Ana, California-
based commercial property broker, said in a telephone interview
about the Moody''s report. </p>
<p>Manhattan real estate owners sold $2.92 billion of
commercial property in the first half, up 70 percent from a year
earlier, according to preliminary data from New York-based
research firm Real Capital Analytics. About $1.42 billion of
those sales were for office buildings, up 62 percent from a year
earlier. </p>
<p>Pfizer, the world''s largest drugmaker, told New York
officials in April it planned to sell the 634,000 square-foot
Third Avenue tower as it consolidates operations. </p>
<p>A Pfizer official declined to comment yesterday. </p>
<p>Firing Workers </p>
<p>The company has been firing workers and shutting facilities
following its $68 billion buyout last year of Madison, New
Jersey-based rival Wyeth. It has said it will cut 19,000 jobs,
close eight manufacturing plants and eliminate six research
centers as it seeks to lower costs. </p>
<p>Pfizer is also bracing to lose patent protection next year
on its top-selling product, the Lipitor cholesterol pill, which
generated $11 billion in 2009 sales. </p>
<p>In 2003, the New York-based drugmaker said it planned to
spend $1 billion over 15 years to expand in the city and add
jobs. Since then, it has fired 40,000 employees worldwide in
addition to the 19,000 it plans to shed after buying Wyeth. </p>
<p>The company already stopped receiving city benefits under a
deal intended to lure companies to relocate or expand in New
York. It may have to refund tax breaks and pay penalties of as
much as double the $12 million it got in public benefits, David Lombino, spokesman for the city Economic Development Corp., said
in May. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp.,
ConocoPhillips and Royal Dutch Shell Plc plan to build and
deploy a $1 billion rapid-response system to capture and contain
oil in the event of a future underwater well blowout. </p>
<p>The four companies will contribute $250 million each toward
the creation of a non-profit organization, the Marine Well
Containment Co., that will create and manage containment
equipment and responses in the Gulf of Mexico, Alan Jeffers, an
Exxon spokesman, said today in a phone interview. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil is taking the lead on the engineering
construction phase, but the plan is to set up a non-profit
organization that will ultimately manage this, Jeffers said.
It''s still in the development stages, but we''re going to ask
others to join and those who choose not to join can have access
to the equipment via commercial arrangements. </p>
<p>BP Plc, which has been struggling to contain an underwater
oil gusher after a Gulf rig exploded in April, wasn''t listed as
a participant. </p>
<p>Our focus right now is the response to the current
situation, Scott Dean, a BP spokesman, said in a phone
interview. We''ve said from early on that there will be lessons
learned from this incident and we''re sure that changes will be
made in the industry. </p>
<p>As part of the new initiative led by Exxon, the biggest
U.S. oil company, equipment will be designed for several
scenarios up to 10,000 feet (3,048 meters) in depth specific to
conditions in the Gulf. The system will be able to mobilize
within 24 hours and have initial capacity to contain 100,000
barrels a day, according to an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Additional costs for equipment, contracts and new vessels
may increase the $1 billion commitment, according to the
statement. The companies said in the statement that they have
reviewed the system with Congress. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Co., the world''s largest
soft-drink maker, posted a 16 percent increase in second-quarter
profit as North American sales volumes climbed for the first
time since 2007. </p>
<p>Net income rose to $2.37 billion, or $1.02 a share, the
company said today in a statement. Excluding some items, profit
was $1.06, compared with the $1.03 average of estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. Beverage volume in North America advanced 2
percent, compared with a 1 percent decline a year ago. </p>
<p>The volume growth in North America, Coca-Cola''s largest
market, exceeded predictions from analysts such as Mark Swartzberg at Stifel Nicolaus  Co. Coca-Cola benefited from
marketing tied to the 2010 World Cup and from surging sales of
sports beverages like Powerade. </p>
<p>They are having great success with their investments and
marketing, Agata Kaczanowska, a beverage-industry analyst for
market researcher IBISWorld in Santa Monica, California, said
today in an interview. People will invest a couple of bucks to
cool off and refresh themselves. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola gained 84 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $54.08 at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
stock has dropped 5.1 percent this year, while rival PepsiCo
Inc. gained 5.2 percent and the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index
declined 4.1 percent. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola''s growth outstripped PepsiCo''s in North America,
where a drop in consumer confidence has escalated competition.
PepsiCo posted a 1 percent decline in North American volume in
the second quarter excluding the effect of a distribution deal
with Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc. </p>
<p>Global Results </p>
<p>Global sales by drink volume grew 5 percent at Coca-Cola,
with the Eurasia and Africa unit showing the fastest growth at
10 percent. Coca-Cola used the World Cup soccer tournament,
hosted by South Africa, to stage its largest marketing campaign,
covering 160 countries and attracting more customers. </p>
<p>European sales by drink volume fell 1 percent, hurt by
ongoing challenges in southern and eastern Europe, Coca-Cola
said. Volume growth in the Pacific region, which amounted to 6
percent in the quarter, was hampered by bad weather in parts of
China and Japan, according to the beverage maker. </p>
<p>Consumer sentiment is still not out of the tunnel, in
terms of employment, in terms of real estate, in terms of
banking, in terms of investment, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Muhtar Kent said today said during a telephone call with
reporters. We do see rays of hope. </p>
<p>Total sales advanced 4.9 percent to $8.67 billion. A year
earlier, second-quarter profit at Atlanta-based Coca-Cola was
$2.04 billion, or 88 cents a share. </p>
<p>Yesterday, Purchase, New York-based PepsiCo reported a 3.4
percent drop in second-quarter profit on costs to integrate its
largest bottlers. Coca-Cola has said it plans to finish its
purchase of the North American assets of its largest bottler in
October, aiming to improve beverage profit and distribution. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley rose by the most in
more than a year in New York trading after reporting earnings
that beat analysts'' estimates and revenue from trading stocks
that surpassed all five of the company''s bigger competitors. </p>
<p>The shares surged 6.3 percent, the biggest gain since July
13, 2009, after the New York-based company posted second-quarter
net income of $1.96 billion, or $1.09 a share. Earnings from
continuing operations were 80 cents a share, including a 20-cent
tax benefit, compared with the 47-cent average estimate of 21
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer James Gorman has added employees to
Morgan Stanley''s sales and trading unit to close a gap with
larger competitors including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Stock-
trading revenue jumped 82 percent from a year earlier and the 12
percent decline in overall trading revenue from the first
quarter was smaller than the drop at bigger banks. </p>
<p>Quite impressive compared to Goldman Sachs, said Gary Townsend, chief executive officer of Hill-Townsend Capital LLC
in Chevy Chase, Maryland, which owns Morgan Stanley shares.
Morgan has just not had as pronounced a view as Goldman has
had, it has generally been taking less risk over the past
several quarters, and that helped it here. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs yesterday reported earnings that missed
analysts'' estimates as trading revenue fell 36 percent from the
first quarter. Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
the two biggest U.S. banks by assets, last week both reported at
least a 34 percent drop in trading revenue. </p>
<p>Taking Market Share'' </p>
<p>We''re seeing the beginnings of taking market share,
Morgan Stanley Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in an
interview after earnings were released. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley rose $1.58 to $26.80 in composite trading on
the New York Stock Exchange at 4:02 p.m. after jumping as much
as 11 percent. The stock, which gained 85 percent in 2009, is
down 9.5 percent this year. </p>
<p>Revenue at Morgan Stanley rose to $8 billion from $5.2
billion a year earlier. Book value per share climbed to $29.65
from $27.65 at the end of March. The firm''s return on equity
from continuing operations, a measure of how well it reinvests
earnings, was 12.2 percent. </p>
<p>In equities trading, Morgan Stanley''s $1.42 billion of
second-quarter revenue included a $129 million gain as the
firm''s credit spreads widened. The unit''s revenue, which was
$776 million a year earlier, compares with $1.21 billion at
Goldman Sachs and $1.04 billion at JPMorgan. </p>
<p>Trading Reality'' </p>
<p>Trading is still the predominant driver of Morgan
Stanley''s business, said Mark Lane, an analyst at William
Blair  Co., who has an outperform rating on Morgan Stanley.
The Smith Barney joint venture with Citigroup Inc. sent a
signal that they are going in a different direction than the
rest of Wall Street, but the reality is that trading still is
the key driver of their business, at least in the near term. </p>
<p>Revenue benefitted from $750 million of gains related to
the widening of the firm''s own credit spreads. The company
booked $5.1 billion of gains in fiscal 2008 as its bond spreads
widened, then reversed them in 2009 as markets improved and
spreads tightened. </p>
<p>In the second quarter, Morgan Stanley''s revenue from fixed-
income sales and trading, excluding gains or losses from its own
credit spreads, was $1.7 billion compared with $2.3 billion a
year earlier. That missed estimates for $1.85 billion from
Howard Chen at Credit Suisse Group AG and $1.89 billion from
Roger Freeman at Barclays Capital. </p>
<p>Investment Banking </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley generated $885 million in revenue from
investment banking. </p>
<p>Global wealth management posted pretax income of $207
million, compared with a loss of $71 million in the second
quarter of 2009, when Morgan Stanley completed its purchase of a
controlling stake in the joint venture with Citigroup''s Smith
Barney. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley said it will miss profit-margin goals for
its brokerage as retail investors shy away from risk following
higher volatility in the second quarter and the May 6 market
crash. The firm may also reach a target for cost savings later
than planned. </p>
<p>Hitting those targets, given it''s a fairly formulaic
business in many respects, will get pushed out because the
performance is market-dependent, Porat said today in an
interview. </p>
<p>Wealth Management </p>
<p>Gorman, who led the wealth-management business before
becoming CEO in January, said in February the bank expected to
increase the unit''s pretax profit margin to 15 percent by the
end of this year and to more than 20 percent by the end of 2011.
The margin was 7 percent in the second quarter, down from 9
percent in the first. </p>
<p>Asset management reported a pretax loss of $86 million,
less than the $210 million pretax loss in the previous year''s
period. Net asset outflows were $1.2 billion. </p>
<p>Compensation and benefits increased 2.2 percent to $3.89
billion in the quarter, or 49 percent of the firm''s overall
revenue. The cost compared with $3.8 billion in the second
quarter of 2009, when the firm set aside 73 percent of revenue. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s profit may be hurt by the financial-
overhaul bill that President Barack Obama signed into law today.
The bill, which the Senate passed last week after more than a
year of negotiations, increases oversight of derivatives trading
and limits proprietary trading and banks'' investments in private
equity and hedge funds. </p>
<p>Restoring Trust </p>
<p>Regulatory reforms are a key step toward restoring trust
in the industry and the markets, Gorman said in the statement. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley could move certain derivatives, including
those tied to interest rates, foreign exchange and risk-
management swaps, into its bank in order to have access to
cheaper funding, Porat said on a conference call with analysts. </p>
<p>Porat also said that while the firm''s key concern is the
global economic outlook and a fragile recovery in the U.S.,
concern that the recession will return is overstated. </p>
<p>The firm had a gain from the sale of its retail investment-
management business, including its Van Kampen funds, to Invesco
Ltd. The $1.37 billion purchase, which was announced last year,
was completed on June 1. Results also included a $361 million
charge related to the U.K. bonus tax. </p>
<p>Sixteen analysts cut their per-share earnings estimates in
the past four weeks, with many citing volatile financial
markets. The Standard  Poor''s 500 Index dropped 8.2 percent in
May and another 5.4 percent in June. The average earnings
estimate fell 19 cents in the past four weeks. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley, buoyed by rising
revenue, set aside 37 percent more money to pay employees in the
first half of 2010 even as rivals Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s investment bank lowered their
compensation expenses. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley allocated $7.94 billion to pay employees in
the first six months of 2010, up from $5.78 billion a year
earlier, company data show. Goldman Sachs''s first-half
compensation dropped to $9.3 billion from $11.4 billion and
JPMorgan''s investment bank set aside $5.3 billion versus $6
billion. All of the figures exclude U.K. bonus tax costs. </p>
<p>The jump at Morgan Stanley, the sixth-biggest U.S. bank by
assets, is connected to an improvement in revenue during the
period that was helped by better trading results than analysts
expected, said Jeanne Branthover, managing director at
recruitment firm Boyden Global Executive Search. Morgan
Stanley''s equity trading revenue in the second quarter
outstripped all of its biggest rivals. </p>
<p>They must have extremely good people in those jobs and
they''re performing, Branthover said of New York-based Morgan
Stanley. They''re coming out winners. </p>
<p>Employee Ranks </p>
<p>The three Wall Street firms added 5,125 employees in the
last year, with more than half -- 2,900 -- joining Goldman
Sachs. That contributed to a drop in average pay per employee at
Goldman Sachs to $272,581 in the first half from $364,135 a year
earlier, while Morgan Stanley''s average climbed to $126,244 from
$94,465 a year earlier. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley added 20,000 employees on May 31, 2009, when
it completed a deal to combine its brokerage unit with Citigroup
Inc.''s Smith Barney. The higher first-half compensation cost
this year reflects the fact that those employees were only
counted for June in the first half of 2009. </p>
<p>Even with the increase, Morgan Stanley is putting aside a
smaller percentage of revenue for compensation expenses compared
with 2009, as first-half revenue more than doubled. The firm set
aside 47 percent of revenue for pay costs, excluding the U.K.
bonus tax, compared with 71 percent a year earlier. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s compensation costs accounted for 43 percent
of revenue, compared with 49 percent a year earlier. JPMorgan''s
investment bank set aside 36 percent in the first half, from 38
percent in the first six months of 2009. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. doubled its
lobbying expenses as it focused on proposed financial
regulations and faced U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
charges that it misled investors. </p>
<p>New York-based Goldman, which paid $550 million last week
to settle the SEC suit, spent $2.7 million to lobby during the
first six months of 2010, more than double the $1.3 million it
spent during the same period a year earlier, according to new
congressional filings. </p>
<p>Several other financial institutions also increased their
lobbying this year before congressional approval of the biggest
overhaul of financial regulation since the Great Depression. The
measure was signed into law today by President Barack Obama. </p>
<p>Among the top 10 U.S. banks ranked by assets, six reported
increases in lobbying spending between January and June compared
with the same period in 2009. </p>
<p>Bank of America Corp. spent $2 million, up 33 percent from
$1.5 million spent during the first six months of 2009. Wells
Fargo  Co.''s spending rose to $2.3 million from $1.4 million in
2009. Morgan Stanley spent $1.6 million, compared with $1.4
million a year earlier, though its second-quarter lobbying
expenses were lower than a year ago. </p>
<p>The banks'' trade group, the Washington-based American
Bankers Association, spent $4.2 million, up from $3.9 million. </p>
<p>The increase in our lobbying expenses reflects the
additional analysis and legal support devoted to regulatory
reform and related legislation as it evolved over the last
several months, said Shirley Norton, a spokeswoman for
Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America, the largest
U.S. bank by assets. </p>
<p>Higher Costs </p>
<p>Mary Eshet, a spokeswoman for San Francisco-based Wells
Fargo, said the higher lobbying costs reflected the company''s
growth following its acquisition of Wachovia Corp. </p>
<p>It''s important to stay in tune with the conversations and
decisions that occur in Washington, D.C., because so many of
them impact our four most important stakeholders: our customers,
our shareholders, our team members and our communities, she
said. </p>
<p>Melissa Daly, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, and Mark Lake, a spokesman for New York-based Morgan Stanley, declined to
comment. </p>
<p>As the banks'' lobbying expenses grew, their contributions
to lawmakers decreased. Bank of America''s political action
committee made $496,500 in donations between Jan. 1, 2009, and
June 30, 2010, down from $716,822 during the same 18-month
period in 2007-08. Morgan Stanley''s PAC gave $303,500, down from
$663,300 two years ago. New York-based Citigroup Inc.''s PAC
contributions fell to $499,000 from $756,600. </p>
<p>Legislation Passed </p>
<p>Lawmakers reluctant to take money from banks blamed for
causing the economic meltdown don''t have to worry about it now
that Obama has signed the financial regulation bill into law,
said Rogan Kersh, associate dean at New York University''s Wagner
School of Public Service. </p>
<p>Once the bill has passed, it''s much harder for their
opponents or good-government advocates to claim that their vote
was unduly influenced by campaign cash, Kersh said. </p>

<p>Journalists call it a buried lead. </p>
<p>It''s when the real story is below the newspaper fold and
drowned out by a tidbit that seems more sexy or appealing. Such
is the case with the Asian Development Bank''s latest outlook. </p>
<p>Markets moved on the headline: the ADB upgraded its 2010
forecast for 14 East Asian economies to 8.1 percent from 7.7
percent projected in April. Buried was the news that three major
risks must break Asia''s way to keep prosperity alive: a double-
dip global recession, destabilizing capital flows and the
successful unwinding of stimulus measures. </p>
<p>While most emerging East Asian economies are assured of a
sharp V-shaped recovery this year, it''s too early to say that
the V stands for victory,'' Srinivasa Madhur, a senior
director at the Manila-based ADB, said on July 20. </p>
<p>Asia has had an impressive crisis, and China''s rapid growth
is bolstering confidence in the region. China''s dynamism even
prompted Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to raise its targets for a key
index of Asian stocks. Yet Asia is moving into a precarious
period, arguably the most challenging since the late 1990s. </p>
<p>Goldman''s V stands for valuations, and its bet on Asian
shares makes perfect sense in the short run. In a July 14
report, analysts led by Timothy Moe raised their three-month
forecast for the MSCI Asia-Pacific excluding Japan Index to 425
from 405, increased their six-month target to 440 from 430 and
maintained their 12-month target of 485. The index is now 395. </p>
<p>V for Vulnerable'' </p>
<p>The V may really stand for vulnerable as U.S. growth
disappoints, investors poke and prod Europe to assess default
risks and Japan''s woes deepen. Whether healthy growth can be
maintained will depend on the decisions that policy makers take
today about Asia''s three big challenges. </p>
<p>First, the global economy. The historic wave of debt
issuance over the last two years stabilized growth. It didn''t
stimulate it as hoped, and economists are talking about a return
to recession. The same goes for unprecedented interest-rate
cuts. Free money helped banks get back on their feet, but did
little to create new jobs or encourage increased consumption. </p>
<p>The trouble is, leaders are applying conventional thinking
to very unconventional situations. Calls in Washington for
deficit reduction ignore how comatose the biggest economy
remains. Concerns in Europe that inflation is just around the
corner overshadow the odds of deflation. Talk of recovery in
Tokyo defies reality on the ground. </p>
<p>Protracted Sluggishness'' </p>
<p>All the stimulus Asians threw at their economies means
little if Stephen Roach, Morgan Stanley''s non-executive chairman
for Asia, is right that the U.S. faces a period of protracted
sluggishness. Export-dependent Asia can live for a year
without help from a $14 trillion economy. Three or four years
would be another story. Sure, China is booming, yet a $4.3
trillion economy with an undervalued currency is no replacement
for the U.S. economic-growth engine. </p>
<p>That gets us to challenge No. 2: hot money. Zero-interest-
rate policies in Washington and Tokyo are ricocheting around
Asia and increasing inflation risks. The U.S., Europe and Japan
are putting off finding exit strategies from post-crisis growth
stimulants. Asia doesn''t have that luxury. </p>
<p>As inflation pressures mount, countries from South Korea to
Malaysia are letting currencies strengthen. That approach is
more palatable for politicians since China''s move last month to
scrap its peg to the dollar. </p>
<p>Currencies on Move </p>
<p>Now that the Chinese yuan is moving again, they can
afford stronger currencies and it''s less damaging than interest-
rate hikes, says Simon Grose-Hodge, a strategist at LGT Group
in Singapore. </p>
<p>The dynamic may lead to additional obstacles. Overseas
investors seeking profit from the trend may rush to Asia,
swamping the region anew with short-term capital. Managing the
cash glut won''t be easy. Handled poorly, it will add to asset-
price inflation that Asia will find difficult to control. </p>
<p>The third risk -- unintended policy errors -- also looms.
This one may say the most about whether Goldman''s present
optimism translates into enduring gains for Asia''s economies and
investors in them. </p>
<p>It would be challenge enough if it were just a matter of
unwinding fiscal measures. Central banks also need to mop up
untold amounts of liquidity -- much of it flowing their way
thanks to ultralow rates in the world''s biggest economies.
Politicians and monetary officials need to work together to get
the balance right. </p>
<p>On the one hand, inflation risks are heating up. On the
other, the bulk of the world''s poor live in Asia. Getting this
mix right is much easier said than done. Asia has never faced
such a delicate process of recalibrating drivers of growth.
After Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed in 2008, policy
makers turned on the stimulus and left things on autopilot. </p>
<p>That was the easy part. The hard part comes as officials
work to move back to normalcy. That time is now, and getting
from vulnerable to victory could be a bumpy ride for
those depending on Goldman''s valuations. </p>

<p>Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs

<p>The underwriting banks will meet tomorrow with AIA Group
Ltd., AIG''s Hong Kong-based unit, to discuss its IPO, two of the

<p>The New York-based company, which is selling assets to

for a Hong Kong offering of AIA after Prudential Plc scrapped
its purchase of the unit. London-based Prudential''s $35.5

including BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments said the deal
was too costly. </p>

<p>AIA has more than 23 million customers and offices in at
least 15 countries including China, India and Australia. The
unit had about $1.44 billion in operating profit in 2009, down

<p>Going on holiday might be the only
way for currency forecasters to deal with the whipsawing euro,
according to Jim O''Neill, chief global economist at Goldman
Sachs International. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has reversed its outlook for the
euro twice in two months, calling in its most recent forecast
for the dollar to weaken against the euro by January as U.S.
growth slows. In June, after the euro hit a four-year low, the
bank forecast the greenback would surge to a seven-year high. </p>
<p>The euro rallied the most this year, gaining 6.9 percent
against the dollar, following Goldman''s June bearish call. After
the bank switched views July 14 to a bullish euro outlook, the
currency surged for a day before bouncing back down. </p>
<p>Foreign exchange is the world''s biggest fruit and
vegetable store, with millions of people playing it 24 hours a
day, O''Neill said today in a radio interview with Tom Keene on
Bloomberg Surveillance. Anybody who thinks they can get
foreign exchange right all the time should be in a lunatic
asylum. </p>
<p>The swings in the currency have sent the Goldman research
team on holiday, O''Neill, 53, joked, leaving the the
experienced, aging heads in charge. </p>
<p>Goldman''s most recent forecast calls for Europe''s single
currency to fall to $1.22 in three months before rising to $1.35
in six months and $1.38 in a year, according to a research note
dated July 14. The bank''s six-month outlook takes it back to the
position it held before June 9, when it predicted the common
currency would drop to a seven-year low of $1.15 over three and
six months from a $1.35 forecast earlier. </p>
<p>Stress Tests </p>
<p>It was pretty obvious to me back in June that the markets
were getting ridiculously too bearish about the euro, London-
based O''Neill said. I thought we''d rally all the way up til
Friday''s stress tests, and then we''d see the reality of what it
was afterwards. </p>
<p>The euro depreciated 0.6 percent to $1.2806 at 1 p.m. in
New York, down from the two-month high of $1.3029 yesterday, on
concern over the pace of the U.S. recovery and the financial
health of European banks. </p>
<p>I am a little bit surprised the euro is back as much as
it''s done this morning, O''Neill, a former board member of
England''s Manchester United soccer team, said. </p>
<p>Goldman analysts predicted the euro may weaken this quarter
as confidence in some European governments falters and markets
await the stress tests on 91 of the region''s banks due July 23. </p>
<p>Economic Outlook </p>
<p>Many investors forget that the health of the U.S. economy
will play a significant role in the euro''s value, said O''Neill,
who''s been with the New York-based firm since 1995, when he
started as chief currency economist at Goldman Sachs
International. </p>
<p>The stress tests aren''t the only thing that matter for the
euro, he said. Probably just as important over the next few
weeks for the euro is what Bernanke has to say later today about
the implications of Fed policy. </p>
<p>Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke delivers his
semiannual report on monetary policy to the Senate Banking
Committee today, and testifies to the House Financial Services
Committee tomorrow. U.S. policy makers trimmed growth forecasts
for this year and next at the Federal Open Market Committee''s
June meeting, according to minutes released July 14. </p>
<p>Initial jobless claims in the U.S. rose to 445,000 last
week from 429,000 in the prior period, according to a Bloomberg
survey before tomorrow''s Labor Department report. The same day,
the National Association of Realtors will say sales of existing
homes fell 9.9 percent in June, according to a separate survey. </p>
<p>English Football'' </p>
<p>Given the disappointing evidence of the past few weeks,
Bernanke has to give some hope that he will find additional ways
of being so accommodative, possibly more, to make sure financial
conditions don''t tighten any further, O''Neill said. </p>
<p>The real news may come during the second testimony
tomorrow, according to O''Neill, who said the key is whether
Bernanke decides to tie monetary accommodation more specifically
to a 2 percent target for inflation. </p>
<p>While Bernanke has produced very credible ideas as to
how the Fed would fight deflation, O''Neill said, as economic
challenges grow the chairman must demonstrate he knows how to
avoid the deflationary period Japan experienced in the 1990s. </p>
<p>Fingers crossed, O''Neill said. Otherwise, we''ll all
have to watch English football. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, is lagging rivals in regaining debt
investors'' confidence after the 2008 financial crisis, trading
in credit-default swaps shows. </p>
<p>Contracts on Morgan Stanley, which last month climbed to
the widest relative to its peers in more than a year, trade 55
basis points higher than those of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the
other Wall Street firm that converted into a bank after Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.''s bankruptcy almost two years ago,
according to data provider CMA. </p>
<p>Since Lehman''s failure, Morgan Stanley has sought to reduce
its reliance on trading businesses by purchasing a controlling
stake in a joint venture with Citigroup Inc.''s Smith Barney
brokerage, with $1.6 trillion in client assets. Derivatives
prices signal investors remain concerned that Morgan Stanley,
which reported earnings today that beat analysts'' estimates, is
most vulnerable if market confidence were to evaporate again. </p>
<p>It''s basically a difference in their business model,
said Michael Donelan, who oversees $3.5 billion of bonds as
director of trading and head portfolio manager at Ryan Labs Inc.
in New York. Morgan has been lagging on the operating side. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley credit swaps have climbed 92 basis points
since April 15 to 214 basis points, CMA prices show. The
contracts dropped 12.5 basis points today after the earnings
report. They have fallen from a more than one-year high of 305
basis points on June 10 as investor concern eases that sovereign
debt strains in Europe will derail the global economic recovery. </p>
<p>Earnings Beat Estimates </p>
<p>The bank reported second-quarter earnings from continuing
operations of 80 cents a share, which included a 20-cent tax
benefit, compared with a 47-cent average estimate of 21 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said
profit margins will remain subdued for 2010. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley spokesman Mark Lake declined to comment on
the swaps prices. </p>
<p>Elsewhere in credit markets, the extra yield investors
demand to own corporate bonds instead of government debt
remained at the lowest since May. Corporate bond spreads were at
187 basis points, or 1.87 percentage points, unchanged for a
third day at the lowest since May 20, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch''s Global Broad Market Corporate Index.
Yields fell to 3.854 percent from 3.87 percent on July 19. </p>
<p>Benchmark credit-default swaps indexes that gauge investor
perceptions of credit risk declined in the U.S. and Europe. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps on the Markit CDX North America
Investment Grade Index, which investors use to hedge against
losses on corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness,
fell 0.4 basis point to 109.6 basis points as of 12:16 p.m. in
New York, according to Markit Group Ltd. In London, the Markit
iTraxx Europe Index of swaps on 125 companies with investment-
grade ratings fell 5 basis points to 114.7, Markit prices show. </p>
<p>Goldman Swaps </p>
<p>The indexes typically decline as investor confidence
improves and rises as it deteriorates. Credit-default swaps pay
the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a swap protecting $10 million of bonds
and loans. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps on Goldman Sachs fell 5 basis points
to 159.5 today after yesterday reporting second-quarter profit
that was below analysts'' estimates, CMA prices show. Goldman
Sachs, which settled U.S. fraud charges last week by paying a
$550 million penalty, reported earnings of 78 cents a share,
below the average analyst estimate of $1.99 a share in a
Bloomberg survey. </p>
<p>Converted to Banks </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs converted to bank holding
companies in September 2008 amid the worst financial crisis
since the Great Depression, giving the Federal Reserve
regulatory oversight over the firms and allowing them to
increase funding through deposits from retail investors. </p>
<p>Both firms said at the time that they intended to increase
their base of insured deposits, viewed by investors as a more
secure form of funding than borrowing in the markets. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley had $64 billion in bank deposits at the end
of March, up from $36 billion as of August 2008, according to
regulatory filings. Goldman Sachs had $38.4 billion in deposits
as of March, compared with $29.1 billion. </p>
<p>Private Bank </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley is building a private bank to offer more
products such as jumbo mortgages and structured loans to Morgan
Stanley Smith Barney clients. It has hired 100 bankers for the
new unit and may quintuple their numbers by the end of 2011, a
person with knowledge of the strategy said last month. </p>
<p>Investors demand 260 basis points in extra yield to own
Morgan Stanley debt instead of Treasuries, 9 basis points wider
than the average for U.S. banks, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data. </p>
<p>Broad market uncertainty tends to be more negative for
Morgan Stanley than it does for the commercial banks, said
Matthew Burnell, an analyst at Wells Fargo Advisors. And
historically, it''s less of a negative for Goldman Sachs than
Morgan Stanley. </p>
<p>The gap in spreads between Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs
has almost quadrupled since the end of 2009, when the difference
was 15.1 basis points, CMA prices show. </p>
<p>Should they trade that wide to Goldman? said Ryan Labs''
Donelan, who said he expects Morgan Stanley to issue bonds soon.
Well, the market''s telling you yeah, but we''re actually
looking at them as a buy. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s credit-default swaps had increased 67
percent in the past quarter, nearly double the average spread
widening on North American financial companies, Fitch Ratings
said yesterday in a statement. Goldman Sachs spreads increased
32 percent and Wells Fargo  Co. contracts widened 16 percent,
Fitch said. </p>
<p>Concerns over lingering sovereign risks, a double-dip
recession and financial reform implications have sent spreads in
the North American financial sector wider by 34 percent,
Jonathan Di Giambattista, a managing director at Fitch, said in
the statement. Morgan Stanley is an outlier, however. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley said it will miss
profit-margin goals for its brokerage joint venture with
Citigroup Inc.''s Smith Barney, blaming the May 6 market crash
for scaring away investors. </p>
<p>Hitting those targets, given it''s a fairly formulaic
business in many respects, will get pushed out because the
performance is market-dependent, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said today in an interview. </p>
<p>James Gorman, who led the wealth-management business before
becoming chief executive officer in January, said in February
the bank expected to increase the unit''s pretax profit margin to
15 percent by the end of this year and to more than 20 percent
by the end of 2011. The margin was 7 percent in the second
quarter, down from 9 percent in the first, Morgan Stanley said
today in announcing earnings that beat analysts'' estimates. </p>
<p>Gorman, 52, also set out a goal of more than $20 billion in
net new client assets for this year and $50 billion for 2011.
The wealth-management unit, led by Charles Johnston, had new
asset outflows of $5.5 billion in the second quarter, after $9.3
billion of net new client assets in the first. </p>
<p>The so-called flash crash of May 6 erased $862 billion in
value from U.S. equities in less than 20 minutes. Consulting
firm Accenture Plc fell as much as 99 percent before rebounding,
and almost 20,800 trades were later canceled. Regulators have
put circuit-breaker programs in place to help prevent short-term
panics. </p>
<p>Sheer Randomness'' </p>
<p>The impact that the flash crash had on the individual
investor psyche, it almost seems that the sheer randomness of it
was kind of the tipping point, Porat, 52, said. We saw a
real step-back from the market, and given that this is a scale
business, having that activity pull out, particularly the
transaction-related activity, put real pressure on the
margins. </p>
<p>Global wealth management posted pretax income of $207
million, compared with a loss of $71 million in the second
quarter of 2009, when Morgan Stanley completed the joint
venture, the company said today. The unit had $3.07 billion in
revenue, down from $3.11 billion in the first quarter. </p>
<p>Gorman said in a letter to shareholders earlier this month
that the joint venture will play an increasingly important
role in the firm''s growth. </p>
<p>We need retail investors to re-engage, Porat said in the
interview. We''re continuing to execute, because that''s what we
can do and that positions us better for those days that always
do return, but for now our view is that hitting the targets in
our metrics that matter will get pushed out. </p>

<p>Goldman''s apparent willingness to cooperate fully is a

<p>Microsoft Corp., the world''s largest
software maker, posted its biggest sales gain in 2 1/2 years in
the fourth-quarter after customers purchased more personal
computers running the Windows operating system. </p>
<p>Net income climbed 48 percent to $4.52 billion, or 51 cents
a share, exceeding the 46-cent average of analysts'' estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales advanced 22 percent to $16 billion,
the company said today in a statement. </p>
<p>Microsoft is benefitting from a recovery in spending as
large businesses buy new PCs and servers. The company said today
it has sold 175 million copies of the latest flagship product,
making Windows 7 the fastest-selling operating system in the
history of the Redmond, Washington-based company. Global PC
shipments jumped 21 percent last quarter, according to research
firm Gartner Inc. </p>
<p>It''s pretty clear that there is both a PC and server
buying cycle and Windows 7 is a winner, said Katherine Egbert,
an analyst at Jefferies  Co. in San Francisco, who advises
buying Microsoft shares. People are obviously buying it despite
all the hype around Apple. </p>
<p>Microsoft was little changed in after-hours trading after
climbing 72 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $25.84 at 4 p.m. New York
time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares have dropped 15
percent this year. </p>
<p>Analysts had predicted Microsoft would have total sales of
$15.3 billion in the quarter, which ended June 30. </p>
<p>Apple Inc., which competes with Microsoft in operating
systems for computers, tablets and mobile phones, reported
quarterly sales this week of $15.7 billion, topping estimates. </p>
<p>Renewal Rates Rise </p>
<p>Microsoft said operating expenses for the year starting
July 1 will be $26.9 billion to $27.3 billion, down from its
March forecast of $27 billion to $27.5 billion. Microsoft no
longer provides projections for sales and profit. </p>
<p>Fourth-quarter unearned revenue, a measure of multiyear
contracts, was $14.8 billion, above the $14.7 billion estimate
of Heather Bellini, an analyst at ISI Group in New York. </p>
<p>Signs of demand by businesses for bigger purchases improved
in the quarter. Renewal rates of multiyear enterprise agreements
reached the highest rate for the year, returning to Microsoft''s
historical average of 66 percent to 75 percent, Chief Financial
Officer Peter Klein said in an interview. The company doesn''t
provide a more specific figure. Billings, a measure of future
revenue, grew 27 percent, he said. </p>
<p>Sales of agreements that have been signed but for which
customers haven''t yet been billed rose to about $15 billion,
Microsoft said. That''s from about $13.5 billion at the end of
the third quarter. </p>
<p>More Evidence'' </p>
<p>Revenue in the Windows division was $4.55 billion, above
the $4.3 billion estimate of Brent Thill, an analyst at UBS AG
in San Francisco. Microsoft Business Division sales, made up
mostly of Office software, were $5.25 billion, compared with
Thill''s $5.05 billion projection. </p>
<p>It sounds like enterprises are buying Windows 7 and will
roll it out at some point, said Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at
Pacific Crest Securities in Portland, Oregon, who recommends
buying the shares and doesn''t own any himself. We''ve seen more
and more evidence of a recovery in enterprise spending. </p>
<p>Server software revenue was $4.01 billion. Thill had
estimated $3.85 billion. </p>
<p>Entertainment and Devices, the unit that includes Xbox and
mobile phones, came in at $1.6 billion in sales. Thill had
expected sales of $1.58 billion. </p>
<p>Online Sales </p>
<p>The Online Services unit had sales of $565 million, short
of Thill''s $589 million prediction. Microsoft''s Bing Internet
search engine gained a percentage point of U.S. market share in
the quarter, rising to 12.7 percent, according to ComScore Inc.
in Reston, Virginia. That compared with 62.6 percent for Google
Inc. and 18.9 percent for Yahoo! Inc., which is switching over
to using Bing''s technology. </p>
<p>Global PC shipments industrywide rose 21 percent in the
second quarter, Gartner said, beating the firm''s projection of
19 percent. Intel Corp., the world''s biggest chipmaker, posted
record second-quarter sales last week and said corporate
spending is strengthening. </p>
<p>Information-technology spending will climb 7.8 percent
worldwide in 2010, according to an estimate from Forrester
Research Inc. </p>
<p>In the year-earlier fourth quarter, Microsoft posted profit
of $3.05 billion, or 34 cents a share, on sales of $13.1
billion. Net income in that period included legal expenses,
severance costs and impairments to investments. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell
Plc and two other oil companies will spend $1 billion to
research and build a containment system to handle deep-water oil
spills in the Gulf of Mexico. </p>
<p>Exxon, Shell, Chevron Corp. and ConocoPhilips will each
give $250 million to establish a non-profit organization, the
Marine Well Containment Co., to produce and manage the
equipment. The system will be designed and built over the next
12 to 18 months to handle spills of 100,000 barrels a day in
waters as deep as 10,000 feet (3,048 meters), the companies said
in a statement yesterday. </p>
<p>The oil industry has been criticized by lawmakers in the
U.S. for being unprepared to deal with deep-water accidents,
following the explosion of BP Plc''s Macondo well in the Gulf of
Mexico on April 20. The blast killed 11 people, caused the worst
oil spill in U.S. history and resulted in a six-month ban on
deepwater drilling in the Gulf. </p>
<p>For an incident in deeper waters with higher production
levels, the response capability of containment and spill
response is proven by this incident to be inadequate, Jim Mulva, chief executive officer of Houston-based ConocoPhillips,
said in an interview yesterday. The companies have been working
with the government for six weeks on the project, Mulva said. </p>
<p>The plan may also aim to blunt punitive new government
regulations on drilling, ClearView Energy Partners LLC, a
Washington-based policy analysis firm, wrote in a note to
clients. </p>
<p>Drilling Moratorium </p>
<p>A six-month moratorium on deep-water drilling was issued in
May after the sinking of the Deepwater Horizon rig, which BP
leased from Transocean Ltd. A federal judge in New Orleans
rejected the ban as too broad, and Interior Secretary Kenneth Salazar responded July 12 with new drilling suspension rules
that have kept deep-water rigs idle. </p>
<p>Salazar said the six-month drilling moratorium was put in
place while the government reviews drilling safety and
industry''s ability to contain a well blowout and respond to
another oil spill. The containment system proposal is a
beginning point with the conversation relative to how we address
those three fundamental issues, Salazar said at a hearing of
the House Oversight and Government Reform committee today. </p>
<p>The proposal announced yesterday is an interesting one,
Michael Bromwich, director of Interior''s Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management, Regulation and Enforcement, said at the same
hearing. We''re going to want to review and study it carefully.
We''ll ask for more elaboration on it from the companies. </p>
<p>Standard Equipment </p>
<p>The new container system may become standard equipment for
offshore drillers in the U.S. and probably would be adopted in
other places around the world, wrote ClearView analysts Kevin Book, F. Chase Hutto and Amanda Fessenden. </p>
<p>The equipment would add costs for the industry, while also
providing potential new business for oil-service companies, the
analysts wrote. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil is taking the lead on the engineering-
construction phase, said Alan Jeffers, a spokesman for the
Irving, Texas-based company. We''re going to ask others to join
and those who choose not to join can have access to the
equipment via commercial arrangement. </p>
<p>BP, based in London, isn''t participating in the containment
project. </p>
<p>They''ve certainly been informed of what the four
companies have been doing, said Mulva. When the Macondo
incident is ultimately resolved and the well is killed, we
expect in due time that BP will join the effort. </p>
<p>BP''s Focus </p>
<p>BP summoned offshore experts in April, including some from
the four companies, to help devise ways to halt the leak after a
failed attempt to contain the gusher. The company has spent
$3.95 billion on the response as of July 19. </p>
<p>Our focus right now is the response to the current
situation, Scott Dean, a BP spokesman, said yesterday. We''ve
said from early on that there will be lessons learned from this
incident and we''re sure that changes will be made in the
industry. </p>
<p>Early designs are for a containment system with a tight
seal that will fit over a well near the seabed and channel oil
and gas through pipes leading to vessels at the surface that
will collect and store the fuel, according to a fact sheet
distributed by the new group. The system will be able to
mobilize in 24 hours. </p>
<p>If we all do our jobs properly, this system will never be
used, Rex Tillerson, CEO of Exxon Mobil, said in the
statement. The extensive experience of industry shows that
when the focus remains on safe operations and risk management,
tragic incidents like the one we are witnessing in the Gulf of
Mexico today should not occur. </p>

<p>General Growth Properties Inc., the
second-largest U.S. mall operator, will resolve a dispute with
Howard Hughes''s heirs through an appraisal of property in
Nevada, a judge ruled. </p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Allan Gropper said today that the
heirs can pursue a full appraisal process without delaying
confirmation of General Growth''s bankruptcy plan in October. The
company and a shareholder committee had asked the court to make
an estimate, saying an appraisal by the heirs might delay
General Growth''s exit from bankruptcy. </p>
<p>We''ll have a number one way or another by October,
Gropper said in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. Maybe
we''ll just have a cap, maybe we''ll have a simmering dispute. </p>
<p>The Hughes heirs are owed about half of the value of unsold
property at the Summerlin master-planned community near Las
Vegas, which was estimated at $430 million for tax purposes and
given a $1.1 billion book value by Chicago-based General Growth. </p>
<p>Steven Hoort, a lawyer for the heirs, said the range of
valuations make an appraisal necessary. </p>
<p>The number the debtors use for development costs -- the
number is huge, Hoort said. We would like to probe that
number in discovery. </p>
<p>The roots of the dispute with the Hughes heirs date to
1976, when the billionaire aviator, industrialist and filmmaker
died at 70, childless and without a will. Rouse Co., a mall
owner based in Columbia, Maryland, bought Hughes''s remaining
assets, including about 22,500 acres of Nevada land, in 1996 for
$520 million in cash, stock and assumed debt. The heirs were to
get a portion of profits from future land sales under the
agreement. </p>
<p>Rouse Acquisition </p>
<p>General Growth bought Rouse in 2004 for $11.3 billion and
assumed the obligation to the Hughes heirs, who have received
semi-annual payments from the sale of land developed as part of
the Summerlin project. Under the deal, any land remaining by the
end of 2009 was to be appraised and the heirs paid. </p>
<p>Separately, Gropper ruled today that General Growth can
replace its debtor-in-possession financing, which funds
operations while the company reorganizes. The new loan will save
the company $2.7 million a month in interest payments. </p>
<p>Gropper also approved General Growth''s motion to auction
property in Clark County, Nevada. </p>
<p>General Growth''s initial $400 million loan, dated May 15
2009, will be repaid with the new loan with an interest rate 8
percentage points lower, the company said in court documents.
Barclays Bank Plc is the agent for the new loan, which matures
on May 16 or when the reorganization takes effect, whichever
comes first. </p>
<p>New Companies </p>
<p>Under General Growth''s proposal to exit Chapter 11, it will
fully repay debt and other claims, raise as much as $8.5 billion
of new capital, and issue stock in two new companies to current
shareholders. </p>
<p>The company''s exit from bankruptcy is being financed by
Brookfield Asset Management Inc., Fairholme Capital Management
LLC and Pershing Square Capital Management LLC. General Growth
has already won court approval to restructure $15 billion of
secured debt tied to 144 properties. </p>
<p>General Growth began the largest real-estate reorganization
in history by filing under Chapter 11 in April 2009. The company
had amassed a $27 billion debt load while making acquisitions.
It expects to remain the second-largest mall owner in the U.S.,
with 180 properties in 43 states. </p>
<p>The two new General Growth companies will divide the
assets, with the larger one keeping the name and most of the
malls. </p>
<p>The case is In re General Growth Properties Inc., 09-11977,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp., the world''s largest
software maker, may raise its quarterly dividend for the first
time since 2008 as its cash hoard swells, data compiled by
Bloomberg suggests. </p>
<p>This quarter, Microsoft may boost the dividend to 15 cents
a share from 13 cents, giving the company an indicated dividend
yield of 2.31 percent, according to the data. That increase
would cost the software maker about $700 million a year. </p>
<p>Microsoft, which will probably post its biggest sales gain
in two years when it reports fourth-quarter earnings today, had
$39.7 billion in cash and short-term investments as of March 31.
The company is looking for ways to reward shareholders after a
21 percent slide in the stock price last quarter, compared with
the 12 percent drop in the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index. </p>
<p>They really have to do something, said Michael Holland,
who oversees more than $4 billion, including Microsoft shares,
as chairman of Holland  Co. in New York. A dividend increase
is a way for the board and management to signal their overall
business is healthy. Not doing it would probably send an
unintended signal, he said. </p>
<p>Bloomberg bases its dividend estimates on seven criteria,
including a company''s dividend history and public forecasts. </p>
<p>Same Strategy </p>
<p>Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein said in
January that he would hew closely to the strategy of his
predecessor, Chris Liddell, who stepped down as CFO last year.
The approach included holding a target amount of cash and
using all operating cash left after capital expenditures and
acquisitions for dividends and share repurchases, Klein said. </p>
<p>Microsoft spokesman Pete Wootton declined to comment. </p>
<p>Heather Bellini, an analyst at ISI Group in New York,
concurs that Microsoft is likely to increase its dividend.
Microsoft has typically focused on growth in operating profit to
determine when to raise the dividend, she said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>For fiscal 2010, given that we are forecasting operating
income growth of 14 percent, we would expect an increase, said
Bellini, who advises buying the shares. Bellini also cautioned
that any change to the tax rate on dividends may dissuade
Microsoft from lifting it materially. </p>
<p>Microsoft will probably say fourth-quarter earnings per
share rose to 46 cents, the average of analysts'' estimates
compiled by Bloomberg, from 34 cents a year earlier. Analysts
predict revenue will rise 16 percent to $15.3 billion. </p>
<p>PC Demand </p>
<p>The gains were fueled in part by rising demand for personal
computers. Global PC sales rose 21 percent last quarter,
according to Gartner Inc. outpacing the research firm''s forecast
for a 19 percent climb. Intel Corp., the world''s biggest
chipmaker, said last week that corporate spending is increasing. </p>
<p>Some technology companies have been turning away from large
acquisitions, instead accumulating cash, which they may use for
dividends and share buybacks, according to Bloomberg analysis.
With International Business Machines Corp. and Analog Devices
Inc. already boosting payouts this year, there''s increased
pressure on other technology firms. </p>
<p>Bloomberg analysis predicts increases from Maxim Integrated
Products, Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc. and Quality
Systems Inc. </p>
<p>Over the past decade, Microsoft, with one of the biggest
cash piles among non-banking companies, has experimented with
strategies to return funds to shareholders. </p>
<p>Payout History </p>
<p>Microsoft declared its first dividend in 2003, when it had
more than $43 billion in the bank. Less than two years later
with cash mounting, the company paid a special one-time dividend
of $3 a share. </p>
<p>Microsoft rose 69 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $25.81 at 12:34
p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares
had lost 18 percent this year before today. </p>
<p>In 2006, when investors urged the company to repurchase at
least $60 billion of stock, Microsoft tried a $20 billion tender
offer for its own shares. The offer failed to generate enough
interest and investors tendered just $3.8 billion in stock. </p>
<p>Microsoft is now in the middle of a $40 billion repurchase
program that runs through 2013. The company stopped repurchases
for three quarters during the economic slump to conserve cash. </p>
<p>Since the recession ended, many investors have shown a
preference for using the cash for payouts rather than buybacks,
Holland said. There isn''t much evidence that repurchases raise
the stock price, especially with regard to Microsoft, he said.
The stock trades in the same range as it did five years ago. </p>
<p>Still, a dividend increase may do little to assuage
investors seeking new areas of growth now that Microsoft''s
Windows 7 operating system is out the door. Some shareholders
are concerned about the company''s declining market share in
mobile phones and Apple Inc.''s ascent in tablet-style computers,
said Tony Ursillo, an analyst at Loomis, Sayles  Co. in Boston. </p>
<p>That may pose a threat to notebooks running Windows, said
Ursillo, whose firm owns Microsoft shares. </p>
<p>People cared about Windows 7, he said. They don''t
seem to care about anything else that may be going well for the
company. </p>

<p>General Maritime Corp., which just
bought five supertankers, may buy more vessels amid low ship
prices, the company''s chief financial officer said. </p>
<p>We are still in a time frame where asset values are
attractive relative to potential returns, the CFO, Jeffrey Pribor, said in a telephone interview. While we will take the
time to digest this transaction, we will certainly be
opportunistically looking for other assets this year and early
next year. </p>
<p>The New York-based company, the second-largest U.S. owner
of oil tankers after Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., has
various resources to finance acquisitions, Pribor said,
including issuing equity, bonds, or using bank loans. </p>
<p>I will never rule out issuing more stock if there is a
use of proceeds for growth that''s accretive to shareholders,
Pribor said from New York. We may not need to do that, but if
it looks wise to issue equity to support another acquisition, we
are sure the market will be receptive. </p>
<p>Prices of five-year-old very-large crude carriers, or
VLCCs, averaged $92.7 million in the week ended July 19,
according to the London-based Baltic Exchange. Prices were 43
percent lower than the record high of $162 million reached in
August 2008, though they have gained 20 percent this year. </p>
<p>General Maritime said on June 9 that it was buying five
VLCCs and two Suezmax ships with a total price of about $620
million. The company is planning to put three of the five VLCCs
into the spot market, according to Pribor. </p>
<p>Larger Fleet </p>
<p>After the acquisition, General Maritime will own a fleet of
38 tankers, including seven VLCCs and 13 Suezmax tankers, with a
total carrying capacity of approximately 6 million deadweight
tons. </p>
<p>The company on June 23 completed an offering of 30.6
million common shares at $6.75 per share. The proceeds,
approximately $195.6 million after expenses, will be used to
fund the purchase. </p>
<p>VLCC shipping rates fell 16 percent to $10,737 a day today,
according to the Baltic Exchange. The rate has declined 81
percent from June''s high of $55,242 a day. </p>
<p>The rate fell to $8,251 a day on July 12, the lowest level
since Nov. 10, 2009. </p>

<p>Stress tests will provide stability
for European lenders and clarity for investors, spurring a rally
in bank debt, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>Strategist Alberto Gallo says that the cost of insuring
financial company debt with credit-default swaps will drop to
match that of corporate bonds for the first time since January.
The CHART OF THE DAY shows Gallo''s forecast that the Markit
iTraxx Financial Index of swaps and the corporate Markit iTraxx
Europe Index will converge. </p>
<p>Corporate bonds are historically more expensive to insure
than bank debt. That relationship was reversed amid concern the
brunt of Europe''s government deficit crisis would be borne by
lenders, with the financial gauge exceeding the investment-grade
index by a record 60 basis points on June 8. </p>
<p>Stress tests and other policies coming through are likely
to increase transparency and stability in the financial
system, Gallo, who first made the forecast July 13, said in an
interview from New York. We see the ratio of iTraxx Financial
and iTraxx Europe going to one. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements. A basis point on
a contract protecting 10 million euros ($12.8 million) of debt
from default for five years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. </p>

<p>A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. unit sued
to overturn a $20.5 million arbitration award to creditors of
the failed hedge fund firm Bayou Group LLC. </p>
<p>The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the
independent regulatory group for the securities industry, on
June 24 issued the decision in favor of Bayou''s creditors in an
arbitration targeting Goldman Sachs Execution and Clearing LP
for its role as the prime broker and clearing broker for Bayou''s
hedge funds. </p>
<p>The creditors claimed the unit facilitated the fraud
committed at Stamford, Connecticut-based Bayou, which filed for
bankruptcy protection in May 2006. Bayou co-founder Samuel Israel pleaded guilty to directing a $400 million fraud and is
serving 22 years in prison. </p>
<p>In rendering its award, the arbitration panel manifestly
disregarded the law and exceeded its authority, Goldman said
in its complaint filed today in federal court in New York. </p>
<p>John Rich, a lawyer who represented the Bayou unsecured
creditors in the arbitration, said the grounds for overturning
an arbitration award are very narrow. </p>
<p>We think it''s completely without basis, Rich said. We

<p>Microsoft Corp., the world''s largest
software maker, posted record fourth-quarter revenue after the
most successful debut of its flagship operating system. </p>
<p>Sales gained 22 percent, the biggest quarterly increase in
more than two years, to $16 billion, the company said yesterday.
Net income topped analysts'' predictions, as did revenue for the
division that sells Windows. </p>
<p>Expectations for Microsoft''s results ran high after
quarterly reports this month from Intel Corp. and Apple Inc.
blew away analysts'' projections. Still, sales at Microsoft''s top
three businesses exceeded estimates. The company also said it
has sold 175 million copies of Windows 7 since the program''s
October release, the fastest pace for its main operating system. </p>
<p>It was a big beat, said Sandeep Aggarwal, an analyst at
Caris  Co. in San Francisco who recommends buying the stock.
Street expectations have only gone up in the last two, three
weeks. </p>
<p>Revenue in the Windows unit rose 44 percent to $4.55
billion, topping the $4.3 billion projection of Brent Thill, an
analyst at UBS AG in San Francisco. Business division sales,
made up mostly of Office software, were $5.25 billion, above his
$5.05 billion estimate. Microsoft released a new version of
Office during the quarter. </p>
<p>Server software sales of $4.01 billion topped Thill''s $3.85
billion estimate. </p>
<p>Microsoft fell 3 cents to $25.81 on the Nasdaq Stock Market
at 4 p.m. New York time. It has lost 15 percent this year. </p>
<p>Falling Behind? </p>
<p>Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities in
Portland, Oregon, said he expected the shares to rise on the
results. The stock may be held back on investor concern that
Microsoft is falling behind in areas like mobile-phones and
tablet computers. He said his clients are less focused on
results from Windows and Office. </p>
<p>All I can conclude is that shareholders are just not
interested in paying for Windows and Office earnings, he said.
If the stock is not going to move on this, what''s it going to
take to make it move? </p>
<p>Fourth-quarter net income climbed 48 percent to $4.52
billion, or 51 cents a share, exceeding the 46-cent average of
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Analysts had predicted
Microsoft would have total sales of $15.3 billion in the period,
which ended June 30. </p>
<p>Apple, which competes with Microsoft in operating systems
for computers, tablets and mobile phones, reported quarterly
sales this week of $15.7 billion, topping estimates. Intel, the
world''s biggest chipmaker, posted record second-quarter sales
last week and said corporate spending is strengthening. </p>
<p>Multiyear Contracts </p>
<p>Microsoft''s fourth-quarter unearned revenue, a measure of
multiyear contracts, was $14.8 billion, above the $14.7 billion
estimate of Heather Bellini, an analyst at ISI Group in New
York. </p>
<p>Signs of demand by businesses for bigger purchases improved
in the quarter. Renewal rates of multiyear enterprise agreements
reached the highest for the year, returning to Microsoft''s
historical average of 66 percent to 75 percent, Chief Financial
Officer Peter Klein said in an interview. The company doesn''t
provide a more specific figure. Billings, a measure of future
revenue, grew 27 percent, he said. </p>
<p>Revenue from agreements that have been signed but for which
customers haven''t yet been billed rose to about $15 billion,
Microsoft said. That''s from about $13.5 billion at the end of
the third quarter. </p>
<p>Mobile Competition </p>
<p>Shareholders may remain unimpressed by Microsoft''s
successes, with the company facing accelerating competition in
mobile and tablet devices from Apple and Google Inc., Barnicle
said. </p>
<p>Steve Ballmer, Microsoft''s chief executive officer, said in
June that the company missed a whole cycle in mobile-phone
software, underscoring the company''s challenges from rivals. </p>
<p>Sales in the Online Services unit fell short of Thill''s
prediction. Still, the Bing Internet search engine gained a
point of U.S. market share in the quarter, rising to 12.7
percent, according to ComScore Inc. in Reston, Virginia. Google
had 62.6 percent, followed by 18.9 percent for Yahoo! Inc.,

<p>Walt Disney Co. is in talks to buy
Playdom Inc., maker of video games played on the Facebook
social-networking website, according to a person with knowledge
of the negotiations. </p>
<p>An agreement may be reached as soon as the coming week,
said the person, who sought anonymity because a deal hasn''t been
reached. Playdom may be sold for more than $500 million, the
Wall Street Journal reported yesterday. TechCrunch.com reported
the talks earlier. </p>
<p>Playdom would extend Disney''s expansion in online and
mobile games. This month, the company acquired Tapulous Inc., a
developer of music-related games for Apple Inc.''s iPod and iPad.
Disney, the world''s largest media company, is attracted to the
growth of mobile games and mobile media, Steve Wadsworth, head
of the Internet unit, said in a July 1 interview. </p>
<p>Playdom is the biggest guy left that''s independent that''s

analyst with Wedbush Morgan Securities. </p>
<p>Jonathan Friedland, a spokeswoman for Burbank, California-
based Disney, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Mountain View, California-based Playdom raised $33 million
in June, from venture capital groups including Disney-backed
Steamboat Ventures, which invests in digital media, consumer and
technology companies. The funding brought the total raised by
the company to $76 million. </p>
<p>Playdom announced a content partnership with Disney''s ESPN
sports cable channel in May. </p>
<p>Disney rose 54 cents to $34.13 today in New York Stock

<p>International Business Machines
Corp., the world''s biggest provider of computer services, is
being investigated by the European Union over claims it abused
its dominant position in the market for mainframe computers. </p>
<p>The probe will review claims IBM linked sales of its
hardware to its software for mainframe computers and that IBM
discriminated against competing sellers of services for the
computers, the Brussels-based European Commission said in a
statement today. IBM said the probe was the result of a campaign
by proxies of competitors led by Microsoft Corp. </p>
<p>The commission, the antitrust regulator for the 27-nation
EU, said the probe is partially in response to a complaint by T3
Technologies Inc., which Microsoft invested in. T3 makes
software that transfers mainframe functions to servers that can
run Microsoft''s Windows operating system. </p>
<p>Even as IBM has shifted away from hardware to focus on
software and services, the mainframe has remained of central
importance to the company. Though IBM gets less than 4 percent
of its revenue directly from selling mainframes, the machines
help generate sales of software, services and financing.
Altogether, the contribution is almost a quarter of IBM''s sales
and 40 percent of its profits, Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi wrote in a report today. </p>
<p>IBM, based in Armonk, New York, said in a statement that
there is no merit to the claims being made by Microsoft and
its satellite proxies. </p>
<p>Microsoft Probes </p>
<p>Certain IBM competitors which have been unable to win in
the marketplace through investments in fundamental innovations
now want regulators to create for them a market position that
they have not earned, IBM said. </p>
<p>Frank Shaw, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft, said in an e-mail that the company invests in startup
companies such as T3 to give customers greater choice. The
company isn''t a party to T3''s complaint against IBM, he said. </p>
<p>We do share T3''s belief that there needs to be greater
openness and choice for customers in the mainframe market,
Shaw said. Customers tell us that they want greater
interoperability between the mainframe and other platforms. </p>
<p>IBM added 3 cents to $128.41 in New York Stock Exchange
trading. Microsoft rose 29 cents to $26.10 in Nasdaq trading in
New York. </p>
<p>The EU has previously punished U.S. technology companies,
including Microsoft, in antitrust cases. Last year, Intel Corp.
was fined a record 1.06 billion euros ($1.37 billion) and
ordered to stop using illegal rebates to thwart competitors. </p>
<p>T3 </p>
<p>Microsoft last year settled an antitrust case with the EU
over its Internet Explorer browser and has previously paid fines
of 1.68 billion euros in EU probes. </p>
<p>The case was triggered by T3 and another vendor, Turbo
Hercules, and involves IBM''s alleged tying of mainframe hardware
to its operating system, the commission said. </p>
<p>T3, a company that builds mainframe computers and is
mentioned in the CCIA''s report, made a similar complaint against
IBM to the commission. Similar antitrust claims the company made
against IBM in a New York court were dismissed in September. </p>
<p>We''re pleased that the commission has taken this
important step, said Dave Anderson, a lawyer representing T3. </p>
<p>The second probe involves complaints of discriminatory
behavior by IBM against competing suppliers of maintenance
services for the computers. </p>
<p>The commission has concerns that IBM may have engaged in
anti-competitive practices with a view to foreclosing the market
for maintenance services, the EU today said in a statement,
in particular by restricting or delaying access to spare parts
for which IBM is the only source. </p>
<p>Newest Mainframe </p>
<p>IBM began developing mainframe computers in the 1940s and
1950s and is now among the few companies to offer the systems.
The company announced its newest mainframe, the zEnterprise,
last week. The model, up to 60 percent faster than its
predecessor, uses IBM software to integrate it with smaller
server computers. </p>
<p>The company comes out with a new mainframe every two to
three years. After the introduction of the last five models,
sales in its services division, more than half its total
revenue, rose an average of 3 percent, Deutsche Bank analyst
Chris Whitmore wrote in a report. Excluding the 2008 update,
which came during a recession, the boost is 9 percent. </p>
<p>The mainframe, along with services and software growth,
will help IBM raise total sales this quarter even with a
currency impact, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said
this month. Last week, IBM reported second-quarter sales that
climbed 2 percent to $23.7 billion, with a $500 million hit from
currency. </p>

<p>General Motors Co., the largest U.S.
automaker, plans to sell its Chevrolet Volt electric car for
about $40,000, said a person familiar with the plans. </p>
<p>Pricing and ordering details for the car will be announced
tomorrow at 12 p.m. New York time by Joel Ewanick, vice
president of U.S. marketing, at a news conference in San Jose,
California, GM said today on its website. </p>
<p>At just over $40,000, the Volt will sell for a premium over
Nissan Motor Co.''s Leaf all-electric car, which is scheduled to
go on sale in November for $32,780. GM is making the pitch that
the Volt''s longer driving range on a single charge and tank of
gasoline will make it a better buy for most drivers than
Nissan''s Leaf, said Jim Hall, principal of 2953 Analytics Inc. </p>
<p>It''s a duel of being ultragreen versus having better
driving range, said Hall, whose consulting firm is based in
Birmingham, Michigan. A hard-core green consumer will be
willing to live with the Leaf''s range. For others, the Volt wins
because there are many buyers worried about range. </p>
<p>Dave Darovitz, a GM spokesman, declined to comment. </p>
<p>The Volt can travel 340 miles on a tank of fuel, with the
first 40 in electric drive before a gasoline engine starts to
recharge the battery. The Leaf uses no fuel and can travel about
100 miles on a charge. </p>
<p>GM wouldn''t give specific pricing for the car. Retired GM
Vice Chairman Bob Lutz told talk show host David Letterman in
May 2009 that the company was targeting a $40,000 sale price. </p>
<p>Sales Markets </p>
<p>The Volt will initially be sold this year in parts of
Texas, New York, California and Washington, D.C. Next year, GM
will build 10,000 of the cars. </p>
<p>The company has said the Volt will get 230 mpg. The
official rating may be different than that figure, Tom Stephens,
Detroit-based GM''s vice chairman of global product operations,
said earlier this month. </p>
<p>Nissan Chief Executive Officer Carlos Ghosn has said he
plans to sell 500,000 electric cars annually worldwide by 2012.
Both cars will be eligible for U.S. government subsidies of
$7,500. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. expects its Wheatstone
gas project in Australia to gain environmental approval in the
first quarter of 2011, allowing the second-largest U.S. energy
producer to start construction in the second half of next year. </p>
<p>The liquefied natural gas venture may have as many as six
processing units and produce as much as 25 million metric tons
of the fuel a year, Chevron Australia said in an environmental
review filed on its website today. Each Wheatstone unit will be
capable of producing 4 million to 7 million tons annually. </p>
<p>Chevron aims to make a decision to proceed with Wheatstone
in the middle of next year, a development timeline shows. The
Wheatstone and Gorgon projects, among more than a dozen proposed
LNG ventures in Australia targeting an increase in Asian demand
for cleaner-burning fuel, are centerpieces of Chevron''s
global growth plans, the company says on its local website. </p>
<p>The Wheatstone project is set to be one of Australia''s
largest resources projects, generating about A$20 billion ($18
billion) in government revenue, Chevron Australia said in
comments e-mailed by Perth-based spokesman Guy Houston. The
company has yet to provide a cost estimate for the venture. </p>
<p>The A$43 billion Gorgon project, which Chevron says is
Australia''s largest resources development, is due to begin LNG
exports in 2014 from a three-unit, 15 million ton-a-year
facility and may add a fourth and fifth processing unit. </p>
<p>Korea Gas Corp., the world''s largest importer of LNG,
signed an initial accord this month to buy 1.5 million tons of
the fuel a year from Wheatstone and to acquire a 5 percent stake
in the venture, which will have processing facilities near the
town of Onslow, 1,400 kilometers (870 miles) north of Perth.
Tokyo Electric Power Co. plans to take 4.1 million tons of LNG a
year from Wheatstone, under a deal announced in December. </p>
<p>Wheatstone will include a domestic gas plant that will have
a capacity equal to about 15 percent of LNG sales, Chevron said
in the documents today. The project may employ 3,000 workers at
the peak of construction in 2014 and generate 6,500 direct and
indirect jobs while it is being built, the company said. First
LNG shipments are planned for 2016, according to Chevron. </p>
<p>The project needs environmental approvals from both the
Australian and Western Australian state governments. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said it''s
still fundamentally positive on China''s yuan-denominated
stocks even after a surge in the CSI 300 Index, given their
valuations and the emergence of several catalysts. </p>
<p>The Hong Kong-listed shares of Chinese insurers are a
convenient, yet fundamentally appealing, way for foreign
investors to gain access to the A-share market, Goldman Sachs
analysts led by Kinger Lau and Timothy Moe said in a report. </p>
<p>We stay fundamentally positive on A shares, the
analysts wrote. Although we do not expect policy to ease
immediately, we believe any further positive development on this
front can re-rate the market further. </p>
<p>The CSI 300, tracking yuan-denominated shares on the
Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, has surged 12 percent since
this year''s low set on July 5, on speculation cooling economic
growth and property-price gains will spur the government to ease
its policy tightening. Chinese stocks are still the worst
performers in Asia this year, with the CSI 300 and the Shanghai
Composite Index both slumping 22 percent. </p>
<p>Even after the gains, A shares are trading at 13 times
estimated profits with per-share earnings growth of 29 percent
in 2010 and 22 percent in 2011, according to Goldman Sachs
estimates. </p>
<p>The low valuations have already discounted a pessimistic
macro/micro growth scenario and several catalysts are emerging,
including receding concerns over liquidity drain and potential
normalization of investors'' positioning, the analysts wrote in
today''s report. </p>
<p>Stable'' Policies </p>
<p>The CSI 300 fell 0.5 percent to 2,778.68 at the 11:30 a.m.
break, snapping a five-day, 6.8 percent rally. The Shanghai
Composite lost 0.4 percent following last week''s 6.1 percent
advance. </p>
<p>Premier Wen Jiabao last week said in comments published by
Xinhua News Agency on a government website that stable policies
should be the main theme in the second half. He also highlighted
the importance of expanding domestic demand, saying that China
would improve stimulus measures for boosting consumption. </p>
<p>China''s economic growth slowed to 10.3 percent in the
second quarter from an 11.9 percent increase in the January to
March period, prompting economists from Morgan Stanley to
JPMorgan Chase  Co. to cut their gross domestic product
forecasts for this year. Data released this month also showed
property prices in 70 Chinese cities fell 0.1 percent in June
from the previous month and banking lending cooled last month. </p>
<p>Monetary Easing </p>
<p>The recent stock-market gains represent a tradable
rebound, not yet a reversal, driven by speculation about an
easing in mortgage policy, lower-than-expected inflation and the
completion of stress test for European banks, according to China
International Capital Corp. </p>
<p>Still, with GDP growth of 10.3 percent and lower-than-
expected inflation, property prices showing few signs of giving
back, and labor shortages in some regions, it is difficult to
convincingly argue for a general monetary easing, CICC
analysts Hao Hong and Mei He said in a report today. </p>
<p>The Goldman Sachs analysts said they favored China Pacific
Insurance (Group) Co. for its above-peer new business value
growth potential and China Life Insurance Co., the nation''s
largest insurer, for its investments in A shares. China Pacific
has climbed 0.5 percent in Hong Kong trading this year while
China Life has dropped 10 percent. </p>
<p>The H shares of insurers have had a high directional
correlation and this relationship is likely to remain in the
near term give their holdings of A shares, according to the
analysts. They also said the industry''s fundamentals remain
strong, with premiums growing at 34 percent in the first half
and long-term growth prospects looking promising. </p>

games. This month, the company bought Tapulous Inc., a developer
of music-related games for Apple Inc.''s iPod and iPad. Playdom
has the talent Disney needs to expand in social media, Chief
Executive Officer Bob Iger said in an interview. </p>
<p>I want to be bold and aggressive, Iger said. You
don''t get the kind of growth that we want by building from the
inside. </p>
<p>Disney plans to make more acquisitions, Iger said, without
being specific. </p>
<p>We don''t intend to stand still as we migrate this
company''s great wealth of content to new technology, he said. </p>
<p>Playdom, based in Mountain View, California, raised $33
million in June from venture capital groups including Disney-
backed Steamboat Ventures, which invests in digital media,
consumer and technology companies. The funding brought the total
raised by the closely held company to $76 million. </p>
<p>Playdom announced a content partnership with Disney''s ESPN
sports cable channel in May. </p>
<p>Disney fell 12 cents to $34.28 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have gained 6.3
percent this year. </p>

<p>A form of Pfizer Inc.''s erection
drug Viagra, sold as the blood-pressure treatment called Revatio
in adults, may be used for children with a rare lung disorder if
U.S. regulators can agree on how to test it. </p>
<p>The condition, called pulmonary arterial hypertension,
affects only 600 children a year, New York-based Pfizer said. It
causes high blood pressure in arteries in the lungs, making the
right side of the heart work harder than normal and causing
chest pain, dizziness and fatigue. Outside advisers to the Food
and Drug Administration are set to meet July 29 to evaluate
whether Pfizer''s study of Revatio is sufficient to determine its
effectiveness in children, the agency said today. </p>
<p>The FDA in 2001 asked Pfizer, the world''s biggest
drugmaker, to study the medicine in children with the lung
disorder. If the New York-based company meets the FDA study
requirements, the drug would get an extra six months on the
market without generic competition. Patents on the drug, with
2009 sales of $1.89 billion as Viagra and $450 million as
Revatio, are expected to expire in 2012. Some doctors are
already using the treatment in kids with the lung condition. </p>
<p>It''s a good option in pediatric patients because it is
well-tolerated, in that it doesn''t have as many side effects as
some of the other options, said Chad Knoderer, a pediatric
clinical pharmacist at Riley Hospital for Children in
Indianapolis, who has used Viagra in kids with the disorder. </p>

Niall O''Connor, a technical analyst in New York at the second-

<p>The pound rallied 0.5 percent to $1.5569 after earlier

<p>Visa Inc., the world''s biggest
payments network, posted a fiscal third-quarter profit that
exceeded most Wall Street estimates for a 10th straight quarter
as more consumers paid with plastic. </p>
<p>Net income for the three months ended June 30 was $716
million, or 97 cents a share, compared with $729 million, or 96
cents, in the same period a year earlier, the San Francisco-
based company said today in a statement. The average estimate of
31 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 93 cents. The year-earlier
results included a one-time gain of $237 million from the sale
of an investment. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Joseph W. Saunders may struggle to
match that performance next year, when the Federal Reserve
imposes new debit-card regulations aimed at Visa and No. 2
network MasterCard Inc. The rules will cap swipe fees, or
interchange, charged to merchants on each transaction and make
it easier for rival debit networks, such as one operated by KKR
 Co. subsidiary First Data Corp., to gain market share. </p>
<p>While it is too early to fully and accurately gauge the
impact of the legislation, Visa has demonstrated an ability to
manage our business through periods of change, said Saunders,
64, in the statement. </p>
<p>Visa said it''s sticking to a 2010 forecast for net revenue
growth at the high end of an 11 percent to 15 percent range.
Diluted earnings per share are expected to grow by more than 20
percent annually this fiscal year and next, the company said. </p>
<p>Sharing Pain'' </p>
<p>Visa and MasterCard, based in Purchase, New York, set
interchange rates and pass the money to card-issuing banks
including Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase  Co. and
Citigroup Inc. The legislation could reduce annual interchange
revenue at Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America by as
much as $2.3 billion, Chief Financial Officer Charles H. Noski
said this month. </p>
<p>Banks could seek to renegotiate their contracts with Visa
and MasterCard to share the economic pain associated with lower
interchange fees, which would potentially threaten a major
revenue stream, said Stephen Sohn, an analyst with Moody''s
Investors Service, in a July 26 report. </p>
<p>The contracts are the biggest revenue sources for the
networks. They generated $3.17 billion, or 46 percent of net
revenue, for Visa in fiscal 2009, and $2.38 billion, or 47
percent, at MasterCard last year. Visa''s third-quarter service
revenue climbed 13 percent to $873 million. </p>
<p>Powerful Force'' </p>
<p>The number of processed transactions jumped 14 percent to
11.7 billion as spending on Visa credit and debit cards amounted
to $803 billion, a 14 percent increase when adjusted for
currency fluctuations, the company said. Cross-border volumes
climbed 17 percent, it said. </p>
<p>The global shift from cash and checks to digital currency
is a powerful force that continues unabated, providing tangible
benefits to consumers, merchants, and governments worldwide,
Saunders said. </p>
<p>That trend may mitigate the cost of the legislation, Sohn
said. </p>
<p>Card-based and electronic payments, which may have exceeded
cash and checks for the first time in 2009, will probably
account for about 64 percent of an estimated $9 trillion in U.S.
consumer transactions by 2013, according to the Nilson Report,
an industry newsletter based in Carpinteria, California. </p>
<p>Visa fell $1.43, or 1.9 percent, to $75.18 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has dropped 14
percent this year. </p>
<p>MasterCard, which is scheduled to report second-quarter
results on Aug. 3, declined 1.9 percent to $210.09. </p>

been sold in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The current offering marks the third sale to pool
commercial mortgages from multiple borrowers this year,
Bloomberg data show. JPMorgan Chase  Co. was the most recent
issuer, with a $716.3 million offering on June 11. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. said Steve McPherson, president of its ABC Entertainment unit, has resigned
less than two months before the network''s new television season
begins. </p>
<p>A replacement for McPherson will be named shortly, Burbank,
California-based Disney said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>ABC is adding six dramas to its schedule starting in
September after Lost, the network''s fifth-highest-rated
scripted show, concluded a six-year run in May. The network was
the only major U.S. broadcaster whose total audience declined
last season, and it''s also down among viewers aged 18 to 49, a
group sought by advertisers, according to Nielsen Co. </p>
<p>McPherson has had a couple of bad seasons, Brad Adgate,
director of research at New York-based advertising firm Horizon
Media Inc, said in an interview. He never got his footing back
after the writers'' strike. </p>
<p>The three-month walkout by the Writers Guild of America
that ended in February 2008 idled scripted shows including
Desperate Housewives and Grey''s Anatomy, effectively
curtailing the 2007-2008 television season. </p>
<p>Paul Lee, head of the ABC Family cable channel, is
replacing McPherson, the Hollywood Reporter said, citing unnamed
company insiders. No one has been hired yet,     ABC spokesman Kevin Brockman said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>In a statement from his publicist, McPherson said he would
announce plans that include an entrepreneurial venture in the
spirits business and an involvement in a new media
company. </p>
<p>The timing of the change is awkward for Disney, Adgate
said. TV networks are meeting this week with critics in Beverly
Hills, California, to preview their schedules for the season
that starts in September. ABC plans to make its presentation on
Aug. 1. </p>
<p>Comedy Block </p>
<p>Third among TV networks in prime-time audience, ABC plans
to air new shows including Body of Proof starring Dana Delany and Detroit 1-8-7, about a mock-documentary crew that
follows around homicide detectives. The network also picked up
the comedy Mr. Sunshine, featuring Matthew Perry as manager
of a San Diego sports arena. </p>
<p>McPherson established a block of comedy shows last TV
season on Wednesday nights that includes three returning
programs: Modern Family, Cougar Town and The Middle. </p>
<p>The network sold about $2.4 billion in ads ahead of the
season that starts in September for its full-day schedule, with
average prime-time rates rising 8 percent to 9 percent, a person
with knowledge of the matter said on June 9. ABC sold 75 percent
to 80 percent of its inventory, the person said. </p>
<p>By comparison NBC, last in prime-time viewers, sold about
$2.5 billion in advertising, with rates rising about 7 percent,
another person said on June 10. The network pre-sold about 70
percent of its prime-time inventory, that person said. </p>
<p>High-Pressure Job'' </p>
<p>This is a high pressure job where you get results the
next day and millions of dollars are riding on the programming
decisions you make, Adgate said. This is historically a very
short-lived position. You''re always in a pressure-cooker. </p>
<p>Disney, the world''s biggest media company, fell 12 cents to
$34.28 yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
The shares have climbed 6.3 percent this year. </p>
<p>Unlike its rivals, ABC doesn''t carry National Football
League games, which provide some of TV''s biggest audiences and a
platform to promote new shows, Adgate said. Monday Night
Football airs on Disney''s ESPN cable network. </p>
<p>Without football, ABC relies more on entertainment programs
for ratings, Adgate said. </p>
<p>Sporting events have been on an upswing compared with
entertainment shows, Adgate said. That''s partly why ESPN is
the crown jewel of television at Disney, not ABC. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. Chief Executive
Officer Steve Ballmer said tablet computers are high on his
priority list as Apple Inc. takes the lead in a market his
company has tried to foster for more than a decade. </p>
<p>Today, one of the top issues on my mind is hey there''s a
category we have had Windows on for a long time and Apple''s done
an interesting job of putting together a synthesis and putting a
product out,'' Ballmer said today at Microsoft''s annual analyst
meeting at the company''s headquarters in Redmond, Washington. </p>
<p>Tablets based on Microsoft''s Windows operating system have
struggled since their initial release in 2002. Apple, based in
Cupertino, California, sold 3.27 million iPads last quarter,
outselling all comparable computers. The device debuted April 3. </p>
<p>We''re coming. We''re coming full guns, Ballmer said. </p>
<p>Ballmer said the company is working with hardware partners
to produce compelling tablet computers and will be aided by the
release early next year of a new Intel Corp. chip, code-named
Oak Trail. </p>
<p>Oak Trail is a dual-core version of Intel''s Atom chip for
tablets. It will improve battery life by using half the power
while offering enough processing to provide smooth video and
fast Web surfing. </p>
<p>Foreseeable Future'' </p>
<p>Microsoft signed an expanded licensing agreement last week
with ARM Holdings Plc, whose chip designs are used in Apple''s
iPad. While the new accord could allow Microsoft to expand the
use of ARM chips in Windows 7-based tablets, Ballmer said the
machines would be based on Intel architecture for the
foreseeable future. </p>
<p>Over the longer-term, Ballmer said Microsoft would embrace
what we need to over time in terms of hardware. </p>
<p>Microsoft rose 8 cents to $26.03 at 4 p.m. New York time on
the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares have declined 15 percent
this year. </p>
<p>Ballmer said he was less worried about competition in
tablets from Google Inc.''s Android and Chrome operating systems. </p>
<p>Bring it, we relish the competition, he said of Google''s
efforts in tablet operating systems. If we can''t compete with
whatever the weird collection of Android machines is going to
look like, shame on us. </p>
<p>Ballmer also commented on Microsoft''s mobile operating
system, Windows Phone 7, which is due on phones later this year.
Asked what he would do if the program is another Vista, a
reference to the poorly received version of Windows, Ballmer
replied it won''t be. </p>
<p>Separately, Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein said
Microsoft''s board will address the subjects of dividends and
share buybacks at its fall board meeting, as it typically does. </p>
<p>Bloomberg data suggests Microsoft may announce an increase
in its quarterly dividend in September to 15 cents a share from
13 cents. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. posted its biggest
profit increase since 2003, exceeding analysts'' estimates, as
rising production helped the largest U.S. oil company take
advantage of gains in energy prices. </p>
<p>Second-quarter net income jumped 91 percent to $7.56
billion, or $1.60 a share, from $3.95 billion, or 81 cents, a
year earlier, Irving, Texas-based Exxon said today in a
statement. Per-share profit was 15 cents higher than the average
of 17 analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Exxon and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Europe''s biggest energy
company, capitalized on jumps in oil and fuel prices by boosting
production. Exxon''s output climbed 8.4 percent to the equivalent
of 4 million barrels of oil a day. Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson ramped up capital spending to more than $70 million a
day since 2008, ending a slide that left production at the
lowest level since the 1999 acquisition of Mobil Corp. </p>
<p>The law of large numbers says the bigger you are, the
harder it is to grow, said Philip Weiss, an analyst at Argus
Research in New York who has a buy rating on Exxon shares
and doesn''t own any. If they can deliver higher production,
that''s a big plus because that means that they''re going to be
delivering more income and cash flow. </p>

<p>Visa Inc., the world''s biggest
payments network, fell as much as 5 percent after saying the
U.S. Department of Justice may sue the company over a policy
that bars merchants from charging extra to customers who pay
with credit cards. </p>
<p>The department has indicated that it is considering
filing a civil lawsuit, Chief Executive Officer Joseph W. Saunders said yesterday in a conference call with analysts after
San Francisco-based Visa reported fiscal third-quarter results.
We are currently engaged in constructive negotiations with the
department to resolve its concerns as it relates to Visa without
litigation or payment of monetary damages. </p>
<p>Visa, American Express Co. and Purchase, New York-based
MasterCard Inc. disclosed in 2008 that the Justice Department

policies and rules prohibiting merchants from steering
customers to other forms of payment. </p>
<p>The Justice Department''s antitrust division is
investigating whether certain credit-card network rules
regarding merchants'' treatment of various payment forms,
including credit cards, are anticompetitive, spokeswoman Gina Talamona said in an e-mail. She declined to discuss specific
companies. </p>
<p>Visa dropped $3.40, or 4.5 percent, to $71.78 at 1:04 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading after touching
$71.40. MasterCard declined 1.7 percent and AmEx fell less than
1 percent. </p>
<p>Regulatory Uncertainty'' </p>
<p>The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions that address some of
the complaints raised by the Justice Department and a pending
federal antitrust lawsuit brought by merchants against Visa and
MasterCard. One of the rules pushed by U.S. Senator Richard Durbin, the Illinois Democrat and majority whip, will allow
merchants to offer discounts for various forms of payment. </p>
<p>FBR Capital Markets analyst Scott Valentin cited
regulatory uncertainty in lowering his forecast for Visa,
saying the shares may climb to $96 within 12 months, down from
$115. </p>
<p>Management commentary lacked specifics regarding the
impact of the Durbin amendment, Valentin said today in a note
to clients. He continues to rate the shares outperform. </p>
<p>The legislation and Saunders''s comments may indicate that
Visa also is working to avoid a trial by settling the merchants''
lawsuit, said Jason Kupferberg, an analyst with UBS Securities
LLC. </p>
<p>Differential Pricing'' </p>
<p>The Durbin amendment has effectively legalized
differential pricing for all tender types, which may address the
anti-surcharging and anti-steering practices that the DOJ was
examining, Kupferberg said in an interview. </p>
<p>It''s too early to tell whether the legislation and a
Justice Department lawsuit would lead to a settlement in the
merchants'' case, said K. Craig Wildfang, lead attorney for the
plaintiffs. </p>
<p>Having another government agency conclude that these
things are anticompetitive -- it''s been true around the world --
and to have the DOJ weigh in on this, would be, in the grand
scheme of things, helpful to the private plaintiffs, Wildfang
said in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>MasterCard, which is scheduled to report second-quarter
results on Aug. 3, didn''t address Visa''s comments. </p>
<p>We''ve been cooperating fully with the DOJ since they
issued their civil investigative demand in October 2008,
MasterCard spokesman James Issokson said in a telephone
interview. </p>
<p>Joanna Lambert of New York-based American Express declined
to comment. </p>

<p>India''s National Commodity 
Derivatives Exchange Ltd., partly owned by Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., is considering taking an anchor investor, Chief Executive
Officer R. Ramaseshan said. </p>
<p>We are keeping that option open and we are actively
looking at what could be the contribution of an anchor
investor, he said in an interview in Mumbai yesterday.
There''s nothing conclusive at this point in time. </p>
<p>Buying a stake in a commodity bourse in India, the top user
of gold and the second-biggest grower of wheat and rice, will
let an investor tap a market where turnover is forecast by the
industry regulator to rise 20 percent in the year to March 31
from 77.65 trillion rupees ($1.7 trillion) a year earlier. NYSE
Euronext, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Fidelity
International are among holders in the Multi Commodity Exchange
of India Ltd., the nation''s largest such exchange. </p>
<p>Jaypee Capital Services Ltd., a financial services company
in New Delhi, is considering acquiring a stake, Ramaseshan said,
adding that the exchange isn''t necessarily talking with Jaypee
about it being an anchor investor. </p>
<p>That issue is wide open at this point of time, he said. </p>
<p>Jaypee Managing Director Gaurav Arora confirmed talks with
the exchange by phone from Delhi. He declined to provide details. </p>
<p>Turnover on commodity bourses in India jumped 57 percent to
24.6 trillion rupees in the quarter ended June 30, the regulator
Forward Markets Commission said on its website July 7. </p>
<p>The National Commodity  Derivatives Exchange had a daily
average turnover of 27 billion rupees in the three months ended
June, up from 22 billion rupees a year ago, Ramaseshan said. </p>
<p>Stakeholders </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, Intercontinental Exchange Inc. and Shree
Renuka Sugars Ltd., India''s biggest refiner, each hold a 4
percent stake in NCDEX, according to the exchange''s website. </p>
<p>Indian rules allows an anchor investor to hold as much as
26 percent in a commodity exchange. Ownership by foreign funds
has been capped at 5 percent for a single investor. </p>
<p>The National Stock Exchange of India Ltd., which holds 15
percent in the National Commodity exchange, needs to lower the
stake to 5 percent by the year end, according to amended rules
published this month by the regulator. </p>
<p>The National Stock Exchange as a shareholder will have to
take a call on how they will go about it, said Ramaseshan. 
NCDEX as an exchange is watched by others, so I am sure there
should be interest, in the stake, he said. </p>
<p>Life Insurance Corp. of India and the National Bank for
Agriculture and Rural Development each own 15 percent of NCDEX.
Crisil Ltd., a unit of Standard  Poor''s, and Indian Farmers
Fertiliser Cooperative Ltd., each hold 12 percent, according to
the exchange''s website. </p>

<p>Four years ago, Bob Iger, the chief
executive officer of Walt Disney Co., tried to build a cell-
phone business. Disney created a family-oriented service that
included global positioning so parents could track their kids. </p>
<p>Too few consumers signed up, and the company killed the
operation after 15 months. Disney Interactive, the division that
ran the ill-fated cell service, is still unprofitable. It lost
$55 million last quarter. </p>
<p>Iger retains his enthusiasm for digital business and has
switched strategies to buying rather than building. He wants to
acquire social games and other online services that come with
customers and talented creators and that will help sell Disney''s
famous brands. </p>
<p>You don''t get the kind of growth we want by building from
the inside, he said in an interview in Bloomberg Businessweek''s
Aug. 2 edition. </p>
<p>Since paying $350 million for the kids'' social network Club
Penguin three years ago, Disney has purchased Wideload Games,
whose founder helped create Microsoft''s hit Halo franchise.
Early this month, the entertainment giant acquired Tapulous, a
publisher of music-related games for Apple''s iPhone. </p>
<p>Disney made its biggest video game bet yet on July 27,
agreeing to pay $563 million for closely held Playdom, the
Mountain View, California-based maker of Sorority Life and
Mobsters, which are played on Facebook, MySpace and mobile
phones. If Playdom meets performance targets over time, its
founders and investors may receive an additional $200 million. </p>
<p>Fast-Growing Venue </p>
<p>Playdom specializes in games that sell virtual goods. In
Mobsters, players try to build crime syndicates by buying
with real money digital machine guns and henchmen. In Sorority
Life, players purchase clothing and accessories as they climb
a social ladder. Some 42 million people regularly play Playdom''s
games each month, according to Disney. </p>
<p>Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities in
Los Angeles, said Playdom will give Disney a potentially fast-
growing venue to sell Disney characters and media brands from
Mickey Mouse to Spider-Man to ESPN. When the Pixar movie Cars
2 is released next June, promotions might include the
soundtrack in a Tapulous-made music game for mobile phones and
the characters woven into Playdom games on Facebook. </p>
<p>Disney said it plans to launch a virtual world based on
Cars next month. That would be in addition to more
traditional product tie-ins such as plush-toy merchandise, games
for Nintendo Co.''s Wii console, coverage on ABC and the Disney
Channel, and theme-park rides. </p>
<p>Looking for Knowhow </p>
<p>I don''t think they''re looking for Playdom''s revenue as
much as they''re looking for Playdom''s knowhow in working
social games into the Disney mix, Pachter said. </p>
<p>Playdom CEO John Pleasants is moving to Disney, where he
will continue to oversee social-game development and become an
executive vice-president. He will work with Iger''s point-man for
digital strategy, Steve Wadsworth, who has run Disney''s Internet
unit since 1999 and assumed video-game oversight in 2008. </p>
<p>Iger said the buy-don''t-build approach is what drove some
earlier acquisitions. His $8.1 billion purchase of Pixar in 2006
buttressed Disney''s flagging animation division. The
$4.2 billion acquisition of Marvel Entertainment last year gave
the company, better known for cartoon princesses than
superheroes, iconic comic-book characters that appeal to boys. </p>
<p>Club Penguin was its first acquisition of a virtual world.
The site''s founders run online worlds with monthly subscription
fees and sales of virtual goods. They built the Cars site
that will launch next month and are overseeing older ones such
as Pirates of the Caribbean. </p>
<p>Talent on Board </p>
<p>Iger has some Internet talent on his board to lean on as he
makes digital deals. Apple CEO Steve Jobs joined as a result of
the Pixar acquisition and is Disney''s largest shareholder.
Disney was the first to sell TV programs and films on Apple''s
iTunes online media store. </p>
<p>Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg was tapped
in March to become a director. Disney has since increased its
presence on the social network and experimented with using it to
sell tickets to the Pixar movie Toy Story 3. </p>
<p>Big media companies typically lose money online. News
Corp.''s digital media unit lost $150 million in the quarter
ended in March. CBS Corp. stopped breaking out results for
interactive after that unit lost $41.3 million in the first nine
months of 2009. </p>
<p>It''s the right strategy for Disney to buy, says Gina Bianchini, a venture capitalist who co-founded the social
network Ning.com with Marc Andreessen. And they are looking at
some very savvy acquisitions. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc., the world''s largest
drugmaker, didn''t want to take any chances when rules requiring
screening of all U.S. air cargo take effect next week. Neither
did Racine Berkow Associates, a shipper of fine art. </p>
<p>Both are among 873 companies that as of last week had
joined a federal program qualifying them to screen their own
goods for air shipping instead of relying on airlines or
freight-handling companies. </p>
<p>The rule taking effect Aug. 1 requires checking for
explosives all 4.2 billion pounds of freight shipped on
passenger planes annually within the U.S., plus goods loaded
onto flights headed for international destinations. The
Transportation Security Administration estimates the anti-
terrorist screening may cost $2.8 billion over 10 years.
Carriers such as Delta Air Lines Inc. are charging extra to
customers who leave screening to them. </p>
<p>Delays alone could hurt our product, Brad Elrod,
Pfizer''s director of global conveyance security, said in an
interview. It could be sitting in non-temperature-controlled
environments. If you open it up to inspect it, you ruin the
product. </p>
<p>It became a very simple choice for New York-based
Pfizer to seek certification to do its own pre-flight
inspections under the TSA''s program, Elrod said. </p>
<p>The inspection requirement, championed by Representative
Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, was part of a 2007 law in
response to the Sept. 11 attacks. All freight going into the
belly of a plane should be checked for explosives just as all
passengers must clear security checkpoints, Markey said. </p>
<p>Delays, Confusion </p>
<p>Companies expect delays and confusion as airlines and
customers struggle to meet the 100 percent inspection standard,
up from a requirement of 75 percent that took effect in May,
said Brandon Fried, executive director of the Airforwarders
Association. </p>
<p>There will be some spotted areas of hardship which might
take a few days to resolve, Fried said. Members of his
Washington-based organization include Swiss freight forwarders
Kuehne + Nagel International AG and Panalpina Welttransport
Holding AG. </p>
<p>Los Angeles International Airport, Chicago''s O''Hare
International Airport and New York''s John F. Kennedy
International Airport are among the 18 largest gateways where
cargo may back up after the deadline, Doug Brittin, the TSA''s
general manager for air cargo security, said in an interview. </p>
<p>AMR Corp.''s American Airlines, which spent $10 million to
comply, is screening about half the cargo it ships, with the
remainder arriving at the airport already screened, said Dave Brooks, president of the airline''s cargo unit. The Fort Worth,
Texas-based company''s cargo division generated 11 percent of its
revenue in the second quarter. </p>
<p>Rapiscan, Smiths </p>
<p>American bought seven machines, from London-based Smiths
Group Plc and OSI Systems Inc.''s Rapiscan unit in Hawthorne,
California, that are capable of screening shrink-wrapped
pallets. Each machine costs about $300,000, Brooks said. </p>
<p>Rapiscan and Smiths, the world''s biggest manufacturers of
airport scanners, make the only two machines certified by the
U.S. to inspect cargo shipped on pallets. TSA-approved air cargo
inspection is Rapiscan''s largest-growing business and has been
for the last year, said Peter Kant, the company''s executive
vice president, without disclosing sales. </p>
<p>Racine Berkow, whose Long Island City, New York, company
ships fine art, antiques and museum exhibitions, said she is
worried her fragile and valuable goods may be damaged even
though she met the TSA standards for self-certification. </p>
<p>Risk of Damage </p>
<p>This whole thing has been a nightmare, Berkow said in
an interview. For my cargo, it''s going to increase the risk of
handling and possibly increase the risk of damage. </p>
<p>Companies such as Berkow''s didn''t have to buy screening
machines. They won TSA certification by training employees in
security procedures and verifying that goods are secure from
packing to airport delivery. The companies attach special
package seals that speed cargo past airport screening. </p>
<p>Cargo backups next month will be more likely when airlines
are doing the screening at the airport, Brooks of American
Airlines said. </p>
<p>We will see, probably at a major airport, some cargo get
left behind just because of a miscommunication or a spike in
activity that we weren''t anticipating, Brooks said in an
interview. We''re not going to see the supply chain come to a
screeching halt. </p>
<p>Program''s Costs </p>
<p>The TSA estimates it will pick up a fourth of the costs of
the screening program, with companies bearing the rest. Agency
officials have said they will miss an Aug. 1 deadline for
screening cargo arriving on passenger planes from overseas for
transfer onto domestic flights. </p>
<p>Delta carried the most cargo among U.S. passenger airlines
last year with 2.29 billion ton miles, an industry measurement
of one ton of cargo carried one mile. About 4 percent consisted
of U.S. mail. Cargo volume fell 20 percent last year from 2008
after the world''s largest carrier idled the last of its Boeing
Co. 777 freighters because they were becoming too costly to
operate. It now moves freight only on passenger planes. </p>
<p>The airline bought screening machines for major hubs and
gateway cities such as Atlanta, Los Angeles and Seattle, and
expanded its cargo staff to offer screening under the rule, said
Anthony Black, a spokesman for Atlanta-based Delta. </p>
<p>Fee Doubled </p>
<p>Delta more than doubled a cargo-screening fee, to 12 cents
per kilogram from 5 cents, to cover costs for new equipment, the
carrier said in a May letter to freight customers. Customers
that deliver cargo already screened don''t pay the fees. </p>
<p>Even with extra costs, it is usually cheaper to ship air
cargo on passenger planes than on air freighters, which may cost
three to four times as much, according to Fried of the
Airforwarders Association. </p>
<p>FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc., the largest U.S.
air-freight carriers, are exempt from the inspection
requirements because they fly planes without passengers. </p>

<p>Imperial and Exxon will each hold a 25 percent stake in the

<p>The two licenses involved are exploration license 446,

449, awarded to London-based BP in 2008, Rolheiser said. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil and other producers have discovered more than

pipeline capacity to ship them to markets. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley, which last week
reported higher equity trading revenue than its five biggest
competitors, hired Peter Santoro as co-head of U.S. equities
trading. </p>
<p>Santoro will run the group with Tony Lauto, who joined the
firm from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in February, according to an
internal memo obtained by Bloomberg News. Morgan Stanley
spokesman Mark Lake confirmed the contents of the memo. The New
York-based firm also named John Neary global head of portfolio
products. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley beat earnings estimates last week as equity
trading revenue jumped 82 percent from a year earlier. Chief
Executive Officer James Gorman has added employees to Morgan
Stanley''s sales and trading unit to close a gap with larger
competitors including Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>Santoro was head of institutional markets at Citadel
Investment Group LLC until December. He previously was global
head of equity trading at Citigroup Inc. and CEO of Knight
Financial Products, according to the memo, which was sent by Ted Pick, global co-head of equities, and Sam Kellie-Smith, global
head of trading. </p>
<p>Neary will also represent the equities division on the
investment bank''s Financial Reform Steering Committee, which
will help the firm adapt to new rules required by the law
President Barack Obama signed earlier this month, according to
the memo. The law boosts oversight of derivatives trading and
puts limits on proprietary trading and banks'' investments in
private-equity and hedge funds. </p>
<p>Equities trading generated $2.8 billion of net revenue in
the first six months of this year. That almost matches the $3.4
billion in all of 2009, when the division bore $1.7 billion in
losses related to an improvement in the firm''s own credit
spreads. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp., the second-biggest
U.S. oil company, said profit tripled, exceeding analysts''
estimates, after recovering demand for petroleum-based fuels
lifted energy prices. </p>
<p>Second-quarter net income jumped to $5.41 billion, or $2.70
a share, from $1.75 billion, or 87 cents, a year earlier, San
Ramon, California-based Chevron said today in a statement. Per-
share profit was 24 cents higher than the average of 18
analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Chevron follows Exxon Mobil Corp. and ConocoPhillips in
reporting surges in earnings this week after recovering
economies around the world boosted demand for diesel and other
fuels. Refining earnings at Chevron jumped more than sevenfold
to $975 million. U.S. oil futures averaged $78.05 a barrel in
the quarter, up 31 percent from a year earlier. </p>
<p>It''s a common theme this quarter of riding higher
commodity prices and improved refining and chemical margins,
said Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis
who has a buy rating on Chevron shares and doesn''t own any.
I think the company continues to have a good outlook going
forward. </p>
<p>Revenue climbed 32 percent to $53 billion, Chevron said.
Oil and natural-gas production rose 2.8 percent to the
equivalent of 2.75 million barrels of crude a day. </p>
<p>Worldwide demand for oil in the second quarter increased an
estimated 3.2 percent from a year earlier, according to the
International Energy Agency in Paris. </p>
<p>Shares Rise </p>
<p>Chevron rose 19 cents to $76.21 as of the 4 p.m. close of
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock, which has
18 buy and 8 hold ratings from analysts, has climbed 13 percent
in the past year. </p>
<p>Chevron Chief Executive Officer John Watson aims to boost
oil and gas production with wells in places such as the Gulf of
Mexico and Australia. The industry is coping with a moratorium
on new deep-water drilling permits in the U.S. Gulf following an
explosion April 20 at BP Plc''s Macondo well, which killed 11
workers and caused the biggest oil spill in U.S. history. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil, the biggest U.S. oil company, said yesterday
that its second-quarter net income jumped 91 percent to $7.56
billion. ConocoPhillips, the No. 3 U.S. energy producer, said
July 28 that its profit jumped almost fivefold to $4.16 billion. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. named Paul Lee
president of the ABC Entertainment Group, replacing Steve McPherson, who resigned unexpectedly this week. </p>
<p>Lee will oversee the ABC Studios and supervise scheduling,
marketing and programming, Burbank, California-based Disney said
today in a statement. A replacement for him at ABC Family, the
cable channel where he was president, will be made in the near
future, Disney said. </p>
<p>The change comes as the networks promote their slates to
critics at meetings in Beverly Hills, California, ahead of the
TV season that starts in September. ABC presents its lineup on
Aug. 1. Anne Sweeney, president of ABC Television Group, cited
Lee''s creative instincts and ability to develop programming that
resonates with audiences. </p>
<p>Paul''s success at ABC Family is as amazing as it is
indisputable, Sweeney said in the statement. </p>
<p>ABC was the only major U.S. broadcaster to lose viewers
last season and was also down in the 18-to-49-year-old group
that advertisers seek, according to Nielsen Co. The network is
adding six dramas to its schedule starting in September. </p>
<p>McPherson, in a statement from his publicist, said he would
announce plans that include an entrepreneurial venture in the
spirits business and involvement in a new media company. </p>
<p>Third among TV networks in prime-time audience, ABC plans
to air new shows including Body of Proof starring Dana Delany and Detroit 1-8-7, about a mock-documentary crew that
follows around homicide detectives. The network also picked up
the comedy Mr. Sunshine, featuring Matthew Perry as manager
of a San Diego sports arena. </p>
<p>Comedy Block </p>
<p>McPherson established a block of comedy shows on Wednesday
nights last TV season that includes three returning programs:
Modern Family, Cougar Town and The Middle. </p>
<p>The network sold about $2.4 billion in ads ahead of the new
season for its full-day schedule, with average prime-time rates
rising 8 percent to 9 percent, a person with knowledge of the
matter said on June 9. ABC sold 75 percent to 80 percent of its
inventory, the person said. </p>
<p>By comparison NBC, last in prime-time viewers, sold about
$2.5 billion in advertising, with rates rising about 7 percent,
another person said on June 10. The network pre-sold about 70
percent of its prime-time inventory, that person said. </p>
<p>Disney, the world''s biggest media company, fell 2 cents to
$33.69 at 4:01 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite

<p>Walt Disney Co. agreed to sell
Miramax to investors including Ronald Tutor and private equity
firm Colony Capital LLC for more than $660 million, ending a
six-month search to find a buyer for the art-house moviemaker. </p>
<p>The sale to Filmyard Holding LLC, backed by partners
including construction executive Tutor and Colony, is expected
to be completed by the end of the year, Burbank, California-
based Disney said today in a statement. Disney, the world''s
largest media company, began winding down Miramax, founded by
brothers Harvey and Bob Weinstein, last October. </p>
<p>The sale fits into a much wider logic with studios
reviewing where they can save money by selling some parts of the
business or bringing down budgets for film and reviewing and
redoing actor deals, said David Hancock, head of the cinema
market at researcher Screen Digest in London. </p>
<p>Miramax, with rights to more than 700 titles including
Academy Award winners such as Chicago and Shakespeare in
Love, was one of several film assets on the block. Liberty
Media Corp. agreed to sell its Overture unit to Relativity Media
LLC last week. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. is seeking buyers after
falling behind on $3.7 billion of debt. </p>
<p>Our current strategy for Walt Disney Studios is to focus
on the development of great motion pictures under the Disney,
Pixar and Marvel brands, President and Chief Executive Officer
Robert Iger said in the statement. </p>
<p>Disney fell 11 cents to $33.60 at 12:24 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock had gained 4.5
percent this year before today. </p>
<p>The Buyers </p>
<p>Tutor, chairman and chief executive of Sylmar, California
based Tutor Perini Corp., began negotiations for Miramax after
Disney ended talks with Los Angeles investor Ron Burkle and the
Weinsteins, who were working on a $625 million offer, people
with knowledge of the situation said earlier this month. </p>
<p>The new buyers can''t just mine Miramax''s existing catalog
so they must have some plans for future production, Hancock
said. With DVD sales declining and video-on-demand not
contributing as much as was hoped, the value of catalogs have
gone down. </p>
<p>Miramax''s top-grossing film was 2002''s Chicago, taking
in about $171 million, followed by 2000''s Scary Movie with
$157 million and Good Will Hunting with $138 million,
according to figures from U.S. researcher Box Office Mojo. </p>
<p>The Weinsteins sold Miramax, named after their parents
Miriam and Max, to Disney in 1993. The two, who left in 2005,
control rights to some films and are acquainted with both Tutor
and Barrack, according to one of the people. Disney had been
seeking $600 million to $700 million for Miramax. </p>

in Silicon Valley, Dharmendra Modha is building a simulated
monkey brain using images projected on flat-screen TVs. </p>
<p>Modha, the lab''s manager of cognitive computing, urged Big
Blue to back his pet project, which combines advances in
nanotechnology, supercomputing and neuroscience. If successful,
the effort could help computers think like the human mind. </p>
<p>IBM green-lights proposals from Modha and other researchers
at the San Jose, California, facility because some of the
gambles can spawn significant business. Since the 1990s, lab
advances in how data is stored, managed and analyzed have helped
generate millions of dollars in sales. Yet even lab directors
concede chances are slim that any one breakthrough will make a
sizable addition to IBM''s almost $100 billion in annual revenue. </p>
<p>We have no way of making money off of this -- unless a
miracle happens and we figure out how to make better
computers, said Laura Haas, director of computer science at
Almaden and the lab''s second-in-command, who wears a Question
Authority button. We''re different. It takes a different kind
of craziness here. </p>
<p>While IBM may move at a slower pace than smaller West Coast
startups, it aims to give Almaden researchers as much leeway as
their Silicon Valley peers, said Winfried Wilcke, senior manager
of the lab''s nanoscale science and technology research. </p>
<p>If you think of us as dinosaurs, then think of us as
velociraptors, he said, referring to the nimble predators of
the Late Cretaceous period. The freedom we have here is
great. </p>
<p>Mixed Results </p>
<p>Silicon Valley labs have a mixed record of getting a
payback -- a high return on investment -- from their
discoveries. While IBM was able to capitalize on Almaden''s
invention of the disk drive and relational database, many of
Xerox Corp.''s early innovations at its Palo Alto Research Center
-- such as the Macintosh-style graphical user interface --
brought more benefit to other companies. </p>
<p>Making some bets that are unlinked to specific outcomes
is important, but if it''s all kind of curiosity-driven research,
the ROI on innovation investing may not be that high, said
John Kao, chairman of the Institute for Large Scale Innovation
in San Francisco. </p>
<p>Some investors say IBM needs big deals more than research
to increase revenue. While the company has boosted earnings per
share through such steps as buybacks and cost controls, rivals
Oracle Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. have eclipsed its stock-
price performance in part through big purchases that added to
sales. </p>
<p>Research, Dealmaking </p>
<p>Since Sam Palmisano became chief executive officer of IBM
in 2002, it spent $25 billion buying publicly held companies.
Compare that with at least $45 billion for Hewlett-Packard and
$42 billion for Oracle. IBM stock has risen 25 percent in the
Palmisano era, compared with 53 percent for Oracle and 128
percent for Hewlett-Packard. </p>
<p>Palmisano said in May that he plans to spend $20 billion
more on acquisitions in the next five years. On Palmisano''s
watch, IBM also has increased its research spending by 31
percent. Last year, it devoted $5.8 billion, about 6 percent of
annual revenue, to RD. </p>
<p>The Silicon Valley version of IBM fosters a freer attitude
and more of a startup mentality than headquarters in Armonk, New
York. While the century-old IBM is known for white shirts, dark
suits and button-downed attitude, the staff at Almaden tackles
oddball research projects and unwinds by holding sack races and
tug-of-war competitions. </p>
<p>Crazy Scientists'' </p>
<p>Located on a hill in a 1,600-acre wildlife preserve, the
Almaden lab is painted a custom dark-green color derived from
leaves and grass that employees gathered on site. The lobby
boasts a 5-foot-diameter digital display globe that was
purchased after researchers saw a similar device at a Denver
museum and thought it would be cool to have one. </p>
<p>New York was like, You crazy scientists can do this, but
come August, you have show us results,'' said Julia Grace, a
social and collaborative computing engineer. The globe has been
used to plot last year''s swine flu outbreak and more recently to
show the location of people sending messages delivered via
Twitter Inc. during World Cup soccer matches. </p>
<p>Almaden''s projects include an electric battery for
automobiles that could run 500 miles on one charge, a filtration
system for desalination and a program that shows changes in
geographical data. Researchers can shake up an industry, even if
they don''t make a fortune, Haas said. </p>
<p>You''re not going to get rich, but you can change the
world, she said. IBM is a big ship, and you need a certain
amount of patience to turn the wheel. But if that ship turns,
the wake in the industry is enormous. </p>
<p>IBM Fellows </p>
<p>Employees at the lab consider themselves wild ducks for
working on projects that don''t fit in with what headquarters in
New York wants to pursue, she said. </p>
<p>Almaden has a better sense of the next big thing''
because of its location, said Mark Dean, IBM''s vice president of
strategy, who works at the Watson lab in Yorktown Heights, New
York. </p>
<p>It''s the only place in IBM where we''re doing advanced
battery research, he said. The only place we''re doing water
desalination. </p>
<p>Of IBM''s nine research centers, Almaden also is the only
one to hold an annual Olympics-style event, where IBM Fellows --
the highest technical honor a researcher can receive at the
company -- compete with interns in athletic events. Competition
for the first-place trophy is so fierce that research team
directors taunt each other in self-directed videos by breaking
wooden boards with their hands or donning Star Trek uniforms. </p>
<p>High Expectations </p>
<p>Even with its renegade spirit, Almaden is under growing
pressure to produce results, said David Patterson, a computer
science professor at the University of California, Berkeley. </p>
<p>People expect more product impact from their research
labs than they did 20 to 30 years ago, he said. </p>
<p>In the 1990s, Almaden developed a method of encryption for
media content. Used in memory cards and Blu-ray discs, this
technology has earned IBM millions of dollars in licensing fees. </p>
<p>Giant magnetoresistive heads, introduced in 1997, helped
hard disk drives increase their data-storage capacity 40-fold. A
query system developed at Almaden in the late 1990s, named
Garlic, integrates data from multiple sources and has earned IBM
hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. More recently, the
lab developed a file-management system called GPFS that IBM now
adds to its archiving, networking and cloud computing products. </p>
<p>Still, technology companies continue to fund research
without knowing where it will lead. Mountain View, California-
based Google lets its workers spend 20 percent of their time
working on personal projects. </p>
<p>Productivity Gain </p>
<p>We''ve found that people are more productive when they are
working on projects that really excite them, said Jordan
Newman, a Google spokesman. Products including Google News and
Gmail got their start that way. </p>
<p>At IBM, some projects don''t pan out. In the early 1990s,
Haas and IBM''s database management team wanted to figure out a
way of searching the World Wide Web, something that hadn''t
emerged yet. </p>
<p>If we did it right, we might have invented search before
Google, Haas said. But we had the wrong model, and we
totally missed the boat. We were thinking about librarians. </p>
<p>Modha, the researcher working on the monkey brain, quit IBM
a decade ago in order to work on his own startup. After a short
time, he realized he didn''t have the financial acumen to run a
business and returned to Almaden. </p>
<p>We have a 100-year history, he said. The challenge
is, how do we usher in the next 100 years? </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. lowered by 5.5
percent its forecast for New York oil prices this year on
speculation a slowdown in global economies will limit crude''s
potential to rise. </p>
<p>The bank cut to $77.25 a barrel its estimate for the
average price of West Texas Intermediate crude on the New York
Mercantile Exchange during the rest of 2010, from a forecast of
$81.75 a barrel made last month, according to a monthly report
e-mailed today. It lowered its forecast for 2011''s average
price to $79.25 a barrel from $90. </p>
<p>We see both lower prices and a tighter range ahead --
but with increased risks, Lawrence Eagles, an analyst for the
U.S. bank, wrote in the report. Weaker economic growth,
energy efficiency and Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries intransigence provide downside risks. </p>
<p>Crude may fall next week amid increases in U.S. supplies
and OPEC production, a Bloomberg News survey showed. Crude oil
has declined by 0.5 percent this year to $78.95 a barrel in New
York, after rising 78 percent last year. </p>
<p>There''s an increased drive towards energy efficiency and
renewable energy in China, said Henry Wang, managing director,
of Beijing-based energy consultant Gate International Ltd.
This could create downward pressure on oil demand. </p>
<p>Pressure on China''s oil demand, the world''s biggest energy
user, affects global consumption, which may impact prices, Wang,
who formerly worked for Royal Dutch Shell Plc. in China, said
by phone from Beijing today. </p>
<p>Production Cuts </p>
<p>The absence of significant demand recovery in markets
such as North America and Europe prompted Singapore-based Tri-
Zen International Ltd. to cut its forecast in April for Brent
Crude to $75 a barrel this year, said Tony Regan, a consultant
in an e-mail today. </p>
<p>Oil prices may fall more than expected on lower demand and
a risk OPEC member nations won''t adhere to production cuts,
JPMorgan said. </p>
<p>If demand drops, the Gulf Trio, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and
the United Arab Emirates are likely to demand cuts from leaky''
members to rebalance the market, but any delay in response
risks a fall in prices as low as $50 a barrel, Eagles said. </p>
<p>The demand outlook in the projection has been moderated in
recent months because of shifts in the bank''s economic
forecasts, according to the report. </p>
<p>This month sees further changes, which take down 2010
demand growth to 1.8 million barrels a day and 2011 to a
trend'' 1.5 million barrels a day, Eagles said. The net sum
of our supply and demand changes reduces the call on OPEC by
1.2 million barrels a day at the end of 2011. </p>

<p>ABC has its work cut out to
reverse a decline in ratings, said Paul Lee, the executive named
last week to lead the Walt Disney Co. television network. </p>
<p>Lee headed Disney''s ABC Family cable channel until Steve McPherson unexpectedly resigned as president of ABC
Entertainment Group on July 27. The executive, who introduced
shows like Pretty Little Liars aimed at young female viewers
at ABC Family, said he will take some risks in his new role
to pull the broadcast network out of third place. He stopped
short of saying he''d target a millennial demographic at ABC. </p>
<p>The way to program a cable network is to do one thing and
do it well, Lee told writers at the semi-annual Television
Critics Association today in Beverly Hills, California. A
broadcast network is a much larger canvas. </p>
<p>Lee said he will seek to create a brand identity at ABC,
much as CBS has done with procedural dramas and Fox with shows
that appeal to younger men. He said ABC, the only major
broadcaster to decline in ratings last season, is known for
smart programs. He mentioned Dancing With the Stars, and
shows he called sexy like Grey''s Anatomy. </p>
<p>The London-born Lee, 50, founded the BBC America cable
channel before joining Disney in 2004. He said he was
vacationing with his wife on a California beach when he was
approached to take the ABC job. </p>
<p>You have more time in cable to stick with a show, Lee
said. But we are always a slave to ratings. </p>
<p>ABC was the only major U.S. broadcaster to lose viewers
last season and was also down in the 18-to-49-year-old group
that advertisers seek, according to Nielsen Co. The network is
adding six dramas to its schedule starting in September. </p>
<p>Body of Proof'' </p>
<p>The new shows include  including Body of Proof,
starring Dana Delany, and Detroit 1-8-7, which revolves
around a homicide unit in the city. It also picked up the comedy
Mr. Sunshine, featuring Matthew Perry as the manager of a
San Diego sports arena. </p>
<p>Paul has been very supportive of us so far, just as Steve
was, said Jason Richman, executive producer of Detroit 1-8-
7, which will air on Tuesdays. We''re just going to continue
to do what we''ve been doing, added David Zabel, the show''s
other executive producer. </p>
<p>McPherson established a block of comedy shows on Wednesday
nights last TV season that includes three returning programs:
Modern Family, Cougar Town and The Middle. Lee
predicted that Modern Family, nominated for the Emmy award
for best comedy, will win. </p>
<p>Upfront Sales'' </p>
<p>ABC sold about $2.4 billion in ads ahead of the new season
for its full-day schedule, with average prime-time rates rising
8 percent to 9 percent, a person with knowledge of the matter
said on June 9. ABC sold 75 percent to 80 percent of its
inventory, the person said. </p>
<p>By comparison NBC, last in prime-time viewers, sold about
$2.5 billion in advertising, with rates rising about 7 percent,
another person said on June 10. The network pre-sold about 70
percent of its prime-time inventory, that person said. </p>
<p>Disney, the world''s largest media company, fell 2 cents to
$33.69 on July 30 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
The shares have climbed 4.5 percent this year. </p>
