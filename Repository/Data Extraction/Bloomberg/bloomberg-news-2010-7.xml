&lt;p&gt;The private equity wing of Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and TPG Capital are to buy diaper maker Ontex
from Candover Investments Plc for 1.2 billion euros ($1.5
billion), the Sunday Telegraph reported, without saying where it
got the information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal, which faltered when Goldman&#8217;s initial private
equity partner withdrew, may be announced as early as this week,
according to the newspaper. Ontex has about 60 percent of the
European market for non-label diapers, the Telegraph said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs spokeswoman Fiona Laffan declined to comment
on the report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is likely to remain Asia&#8217;s
biggest market for mergers and acquisitions as companies in the
world&#8217;s third-largest economy expand and seek takeovers to tap
new markets, said Todd Marin, head of investment banking for
Asia excluding Japan at JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;MA activity involving China will expand as there are
more corporates across more industries evaluating MA
opportunities and actively pursuing transactions than ever
before,&#8221; Marin said in an interview on July 2. &#8220;While China is
driving much of the activity, MA activity is fairly well
diversified across markets including Australia, Southeast Asia,
and India.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China accounted for 36 percent of the $242.2 billion in
deals in the Asia-Pacific region excluding Japan this year as of
July 2, and had a total of more than $100 billion in each of the
previous three years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Transactions worth $39.4 billion so far this year in India has
surpassed the South Asian nation&#8217;s 2009 tally, the data showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In India, &#8220;there will be some big deals, but we expect
that the majority of the activity will come from the large
corporates that have traditionally been active in MA,&#8221; the 48-
year-old banker said in the interview in Hong Kong. He joined
JPMorgan in 1989 and moved to Asia from New York in 2002 to head
the region&#8217;s MA business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advisory Rankings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based company ranks second among advisers on
takeovers in the Asia-Pacific region excluding Japan this year,
according to Bloomberg data as of July 2. China International
Capital Corp. is the lead adviser in China on acquisitions,
followed by UBS AG and JPMorgan, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the region, acquisitions in the airline, natural
resource, automobile and logistics industries in 2010 may
outpace the number of deals in other sectors, Marin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the third quarter of last year, deals in the region
have been &#8220;increasingly diversified across the spectrum in
terms of geography and industry,&#8221; he said. Transactions this
year have included the gold mining, phone services, auto,
health-care and financial industries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan advised CNOOC Ltd., China&#8217;s biggest offshore oil
explorer, on a transaction to invest $3.1 billion for a stake in
Argentine oil producer Bridas Corp. The two largest transactions
announced so far this year in the Asia-Pacific region are
KazakhGold Group Ltd.&#8217;s $9.4 billion deal to take over parent
OAO Polyus Gold and Bharti Airtel Ltd.&#8217;s $9 billion purchase of
the African assets of Zain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Southeast Asia &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Southeast Asia will get in the spotlight for mergers and
acquisitions in the next six months as countries including
Indonesia and Malaysia focus on natural resource and foodstuffs
production, and economic growth is stable, Marin said. Southeast
Asia recorded mergers and acquisitions worth $40.8 billion this
year, Bloomberg data shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Based on our current book of activity and client dialogue,
as you role the tape forward through the end of the year, we
would expect more activity out of Southeast Asia,&#8221; Marin said.
&#8220;We hope to be announcing a few things before the end of the
year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine customs officers, security
service employees and border guards have seized 582 kilograms of
cocaine, the biggest haul ever in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cocaine was hidden among scrap metal pipes used for
drilling, the Kiev-based State Customs Service said in an e-
mailed statement today. Bohdan Panas, the spokesman of Ukraine&#8217;s
southern customs, wasn&#8217;t available on his office phone when
called today to clarify the date of the seizure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scrap metal was being transported to Ukraine from
Bolivia, which led custom officials to hold an additional
inspection. An X-ray didn&#8217;t show the narcotics, which were found
after a pipe with two additional layers inside was sliced,
according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych called on
law enforcement bodies to take &#8220;drastic measures&#8221; to tackle
illegal drugs circulation. He gave officials from prosecution
and the health ministry two months to propose legal changes to
protect the country from being &#8220;ruined&#8221; by drug sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another 152 kilograms of the drug was detained in Odessa on
June 30, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most-accurate forecasters of
Asian currencies say it&#8217;s time to avoid the South Korean won and
the Indian rupee as the global economic recovery falters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which correctly predicted the
Malaysian ringgit&#8217;s gain this year, has stopped recommending the
region&#8217;s currencies and says the rupee will drop 2 percent this
quarter. ING Groep NV, which had the closest forecasts for the
weakening won and Taiwan dollar, is among the most bearish for
their second-half performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strategists got it wrong at the start of the year when the
consensus in Bloomberg surveys was that the won would appreciate
the most in Asia and the ringgit would be the region&#8217;s weakest
currency. Instead, South Korea&#8217;s currency dropped 5 percent and
Malaysia&#8217;s climbed 7 percent. Now, Invesco Ltd. and Daiwa SB
Investments Ltd., which together manage $482 billion, are
avoiding the region&#8217;s higher-yielding assets as Europe&#8217;s debt
crisis spreads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Episodes of risk aversion will see the won and rupee
underperform and give strong support to the dollar,&#8221; Tim Condon,
chief Asia economist in Singapore for ING, the biggest Dutch
financial services company, said in an interview yesterday.
&#8220;They may appreciate as markets calm down, but the path won&#8217;t
be smooth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s Premier Wen Jiabao said on July 3 that the effects
of the global financial turmoil are more severe than expected,
after a Federation of Logistics  Purchasing report showed
manufacturing growth slowed for a second month in June. Markit
Economics reported on July 5 that expansion in Europe&#8217;s services
and manufacturing industries also weakened for a second month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contagion Effect &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The won slumped 8 percent in the past three months to
1,222.3 per dollar, the worst performer in Asia, while the
Indian rupee declined 5 percent to 46.905. Financial-market
&#8220;stresses&#8221; may damp global economic activity in the second
half, the International Monetary Fund said on June 16, before
releasing forecasts this month. In April, the IMF projected
Asia&#8217;s 8.7 percent expansion this year would lead 4.2 percent
growth worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s property market is beginning a &#8220;collapse&#8221; that
will hit the nation&#8217;s banking system, Kenneth Rogoff, the
Harvard University professor and former chief economist of the
International Monetary Fund, said in an interview in Hong Kong
yesterday. He said the global economic recovery is &#8220;very
slow.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Europe&#8217;s debt crisis has some contagion effect on Asian
currencies,&#8221; said Paul Chan, Hong Kong-based chief investment
officer at Invesco, which oversees $430 billion globally. &#8220;It
was a trigger for outflows of hot money.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downgrading Forecasts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The won is the most exposed to changes in investor appetite
for riskier assets. Its correlation in the past year to the
Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, a measure of
U.S. share-price swings, was Asia&#8217;s highest at 0.75, followed by
the rupee&#8217;s at 0.66. A reading of 1 suggests movement in
lockstep. The ringgit&#8217;s relationship was the lowest at minus
0.02. The won&#8217;s one-month implied volatility, used to calculate
foreign-exchange options, is the highest among Asian currencies
at 17 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ING says the won will rise 6 percent in the rest of 2010 to
1,150, more bearish than the median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of 19 economists for an 11 percent gain. There&#8217;s a risk
it may end at 1,200, an increase of less than 2 percent, Condon
said. The company predicts the ringgit will decline to 3.27 from
3.23 this quarter and the rupee to 46.50 from 46.46. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending Power &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard Chartered Plc, which had the same won forecast as
ING at the start of 2010, is more bullish, predicting the
currency will rally 11 percent to 1,100 as the yuan&#8217;s
appreciation makes Korean exports more affordable for Chinese
consumers. China&#8217;s currency has gained 0.7 percent since the
central bank ended a two-year dollar peg on June 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Robust regional growth should in particular favor
countries like Malaysia and Korea that are closely integrated to
the broader region,&#8221; Michael Hasenstab, who oversees the $34
billion Templeton Global Bond Fund in San Mateo, California,
said in an e-mailed response to questions. &#8220;The yuan still
remains undervalued.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Buchanan, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Goldman
Sachs in Hong Kong, advises against buying Asian currencies. The
New York-based bank, which along with Barclays Plc and Danske
Bank A/S was among the three best ringgit forecasters, lowered
its 2010 economic growth forecast for China to 10.1 percent from
11.4 percent on July 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This isn&#8217;t a good time to be long these currencies,&#8221;
Buchanan said in a June 30 interview. &#8220;For most cases, there is
still room for appreciation but the risk-reward doesn&#8217;t
entice.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cutting Forecasts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs in a June report dropped its forecast for the
rupee to 47.50 by September, from an earlier prediction of 44.
It cut its prediction for the won to 1,150 from 1,100, and for
the ringgit to 3.15 from 3.10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman, ING and Standard Chartered are all bearish on the
rupee, after the current-account deficit widened to a record and
investors sold India&#8217;s stocks. The current-account gap reached
$13 billion in the first quarter, from $12.2 billion in the
fourth, which is &#8220;not what the market is looking for,&#8221;
Goldman&#8217;s Buchanan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign investors sold a net $5.4 billion of stocks in
South Korea in May and $2 billion in India. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m not very confident on Asian currencies at the moment
as it depends very much on global risk sentiment,&#8221; said Kei Katayama, who helps oversee the equivalent of $37 billion in
non-yen debt as leader of the foreign fixed-income group in
Tokyo at Daiwa SB. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola (Japan) Co. decided to end
its sponsorship of sumo yesterday because of an illegal gambling
scandal in the sport, the Sankei newspaper reported, without
saying how it obtained the information.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Federation of Agricultural Co-operative
Associations also decided to end its association, the report
said. Both organizations had supported the sport for about 30
years, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government of Miyazaki prefecture in southern Japan may
also cut its support for sumo, the report said. The prefecture,
known for its Wagyu, has provided a prize of beef to tournament
champions since 1986, the report said.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola (Japan) provided cash prizes of 400,000 yen
($4600) for each tournament, Sankei said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News Corp.&#8217;s MySpace, seeking to
replace a search advertising contract with Google Inc. that
expires in August, has held talks with Microsoft Corp. and Yahoo
Inc., according to a person familiar with the company&#8217;s plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any deal would carry a substantially lower price than the
$900 million Google agreed to pay in 2006 to place search ads
within the social-networking site, a second person with 
knowledge of the discussions said. MySpace also remains in 
talks with Google about extending their partnership, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MySpace has struggled to maintain ad revenue during an
exodus of users to Facebook Inc. and the departure of key
executives. Bought in 2005 for $580 million in cash, MySpace
lost its status as the world&#8217;s top social-networking site in
2008. News Corp. Chief Executive Officer Rupert Murdoch said
last year that the site would fall short of traffic commitments
to Google, lowering income on that deal by $100 million in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re currently talking to multiple providers across the
many facets of search to bring our users the best possible
search experience in a social environment,&#8221; said Tracy
Akselrud, a spokeswoman for Beverly Hills, California-based
MySpace, who declined to name specific companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is looking to boost users and ad revenue for its
13-month-old Bing search engine, which claimed 12.1 percent of
searches in the U.S., compared with Google&#8217;s 63.7 percent,
according to data tracker ComScore Inc. Microsoft has forged a
separate agreement to handle searches on Yahoo&#8217;s site
-- a deal that&#8217;s scheduled to take effect by December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pete Wootton, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft, declined to comment on negotiations with News Corp.
May Petry, a spokeswoman for Yahoo in Sunnyvale, California, and
Jane Penner, a spokeswoman at Mountain View, California-based
Google, also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MySpace Co-President Jason Hirschhorn left in June,
becoming the most recent high-level executive to depart the
business. He had taken the co-president role in February, after
Owen Van Natta stepped down as CEO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News Corp.&#8217;s discussions with Yahoo, Microsoft and Google
were previously reported by the Wall Street Journal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks gained, with the Standard
 Poor&#8217;s 500 Index rising from a 10-month low, amid speculation
earnings growth will help equities rebound from their lowest
valuations since the bull market began in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcoa Inc., which unofficially will start the second-
quarter earnings season when it reports results next week,
jumped 2.1 percent as metal prices gained in London. Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. climbed after JPMorgan Chase  Co. upgraded the
shares to &#8220;overweight.&#8221; Equities briefly erased gains in
afternoon trading after a slowdown in service industry growth
added to concern the economic recovery is weakening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 climbed 0.5 percent to 1,028.06 at 4 p.m. in
New York after jumping 2 percent in the first hour of trading.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 57.14 points, or 0.6
percent, to 9,743.62 to snap a seven-day losing streak, its
longest since the financial crisis in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Stocks are pretty oversold and pessimism is getting
pretty fixed and that could inspire a short-term rally,&#8221; said
Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Milwaukee-based
Robert W. Baird  Co., which oversees more than $85 billion in
client assets. &#8220;Second-quarter earnings are expected to be
good.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 plunged 5 percent last week after reports
showed a slowdown in the manufacturing expansion, a bigger-than-
forecast drop in pending home sales and slower-than-estimated
growth in jobs, fanning concern that the economy may stall. The
decline pushed the benchmark gauge to 12.5 times estimated
earnings, the cheapest since March 2009 when the measure began
an 80 percent rally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dent Growth &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The index tumbled 16 percent from this year&#8217;s high on April
23 through July 2 on concern a sovereign-debt crisis in Europe
and China&#8217;s moves to slow the world&#8217;s largest emerging economy
will dent global growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The retreat came even as analysts raise earnings estimates
for U.S. companies at the fastest rate since at least 2004.
Profit for SP 500 companies will jump 34 percent in 2010,
compared with a projected gain of 27 percent on March 29,
according to more than 8,000 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Service industries in the U.S. expanded in June at a slower
pace, indicating the economy started to cool entering the second
half. The Institute for Supply Management&#8217;s index of non-
manufacturing businesses, which covers about 90 percent of the
economy, fell to 53.8 from 55.4 in May. The median forecast of
59 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a decline to
55. Readings above 50 signal expansion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcoa rallied 2.1 percent to $10.21 as aluminum rose 3
percent to lead industrial metals higher in London. The largest
U.S. aluminum company will report results on July 12, the first
company in the Dow average to release earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The real theme I see is the macroeconomic argument, which
is negative, versus the microeconomic argument, which is
oversold,&#8221; said Sean Kraus, who oversees $2.2 billion as chief
investment officer at Citizens Business Bank in Pasadena,
California. &#8220;You&#8217;re seeing it today with the up and down moves.&#8221;
He added, &#8220;when earnings season begins, you&#8217;re going to get a
lot of company management teams that are cautious.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs gained 0.9 percent to $132.26. JPMorgan
upgraded the stock from &#8220;neutral&#8221; as it analyzed the effect of
potential changes to capital regulation. Goldman Sachs is &#8220;best
in class&#8221; in allocating capital per unit and managing risk,
JPMorgan wrote in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GE Gains &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Electric Co. advanced 0.7 percent to $13.97. The
world&#8217;s biggest maker of jet engines, power-generation equipment
and locomotives said it received contracts of about $300 million
to provide five gas turbines and signed a 15-year service
agreement for a power plant in Salalah, southwest Oman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Micron Technology Inc. rose 1.6 percent to $8.35 and Intel
Corp. climbed 1.5 percent to $19.48. The chipmakers gained after
the Semiconductor Industry Association said global sales climbed
4.5 percent in May from the previous month, helped by higher
demand for chips used in computers and mobile phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadwind Energy Inc. surged 16 percent, the most in the
Russell 2000 Index, to $3.23. The maker of wind towers said it
will supply Gamesa Corporaci&#243;n Tecnol&#243;gica, a Spain-based
manufacturer of wind turbine generators, at its U.S. sites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hospital shares advanced after Barclays Plc said the
industry&#8217;s slump since May was &#8220;overdone&#8221; and now is the time
to &#8220;become more aggressive&#8221; on the group since the companies
will be able to cut costs to offset lower volumes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tenet Healthcare Corp. rose the most in the SP 500,
gaining 4.1 percent to $4.32. Community Health Systems Inc.
advanced 2.4 percent to $32.21 and Health Management Associates
Inc. rallied 0.4 percent to $7.35. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Consumer Hangover&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of consumer-discretionary companies fell 0.1
percent, the only group out of 10 on the SP 500 to end lower.
U.S. retailers will suffer from a &#8220;consumer hangover&#8221; that
lasts through the holiday shopping season, according to Deborah L. Weinswig, an analyst at Citigroup Inc. Office Depot Inc. and
Sears Holdings Corp. fell at least 4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weinswig cut earnings estimates for Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,
the world&#8217;s largest retailer, as well as Home Depot Inc., J.C.
Penney Co., Kohl&#8217;s Corp., Lowe&#8217;s Cos., Macy&#8217;s Inc., Nordstrom
Inc., Saks Inc. and Target Corp. through January 2013 and
lowered stock-price projections for each company. Home Depot
dropped the most in the Dow, slumping 1.5 percent to $27.34. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla Motors Inc. tumbled 16 percent to $16.11. The first
U.S. automaker to complete an initial public offering in more
than a half century retreated for a fourth straight day to fall
below its IPO price of $17 a share. The Palo Alto, California-
based company has slid 33 percent since rallying 41 percent on
June 29, its first day of trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. fell 5.1 percent to $44.49.

&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy bullish Apple
Inc. options because &#8220;rapid growth&#8221; in iPhone and iPad sales
may help boost the shares by 58 percent through December 2011,
JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity derivatives strategists Amyn Bharwani and Marko Kolanovic recommended purchasing October $250 calls while
selling October $280 calls, a strategy known as a call spread
that cuts the cost of the trade while capping potential profit.
Apple gained 0.7 percent to $248.63 in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based strategists cited JPMorgan technology
analyst Mark Moskowitz, who boosted his Apple share-price
forecast by 23 percent to $390 on July 1, calling Cupertino,
California-based Apple &#8220;the growth story without rival.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The October options give &#8220;enough time&#8221; for Moskowitz&#8217;s
view to materialize, Bharwani and Kolanovic said. &#8220;We think it
would be prudent for investors to gain upside exposure to the
stock through call spreads, rather outright stock, as the stock
is close to its historical highs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade will make money at expiration if Apple&#8217;s stock is
above $261.60, the strategists said. The shares closed at a
record high of $274.07 on June 18 and have climbed 18 percent
this year following the introduction of the iPad. The Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 Information Technology Index is down 11 percent since
Dec. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said June 22 that it sold 3 million iPads in
the 80 days since the device went on the sale in the U.S. Apple
said June 28 that it sold 1.7 million iPhone 4s in its first
three days, a record for the newest iteration of its top-selling
product featuring video calling and an updated body. The iPhone
4 made its debut in the U.S., U.K., Japan, France and Germany on
June 24. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy Inc. (WLT), a southern
Appalachia producer of steelmaking coal, led other producers
higher as stocks worldwide climbed on lower valuations and after
Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (CLF) agreed to buy the West Virginia
coal operations of INR Energy LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter rose $3.05, or 5 percent, to $64.51 at 9:45 a.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Patriot Coal Corp.,
the fourth-biggest eastern U.S. coal company, jumped 58 cents,
or 5.1 percent, to $11.88. Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR), the
third-largest U.S. coal producer, gained $1.59, or 4.8 percent,
to $34.85. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cliffs, North America&#8217;s largest iron-ore producer, will pay
$757 million for the 68 million tons worth of metallurgical coal
reserves and the 51 million tons of thermal, it said in a

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Other than the broad markets and all that stuff, this is
coming from the Cliffs deal,&#8221; said Jim Rollyson, an analyst at

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp.&#8217;s Japanese unit and
Petroleo Brasileiro SA may have to spend billions of dollars
upgrading plants or else shut units because of new rules aimed
at boosting heavy-oil refining, analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulations require refiners to increase the proportion
of gasoline and gasoil they produce from residues, which are
cheaper than lighter crudes, Trade Minister Masayuki Naoshima
said yesterday. The move may force the nation&#8217;s fuel producers
to cut capacity by 800,000 barrels a day, or 17 percent, as they
opt to mothball plants rather than carry out costly upgrades,
said Hidetoshi Shioda, a senior energy analyst at Mizuho
Securities Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are meant to compel Japanese refiners to
modernize refineries or cut capacity in an oversupplied market
so they can compete more effectively with Asian rivals,
according to the trade ministry. About 10 percent of the
country&#8217;s capacity is dedicated to heavy oil processing,
compared with 36 percent in China and an Asian average of 19
percent, the ministry said in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s unit, Tonengeneral Sekiyu K.K., Cosmo Oil Co. and
the Brazilian company known as Petrobras stand to lose the most
because they have low ratios of residue-refining capacity to
crude distillation, said Osamu Fujisawa a Tokyo-based oil
economist at industry consultant FE Associates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given the bleak prospects for Japan&#8217;s fuel demand, these
refiners aren&#8217;t likely to spend large sums of money on upgrades
but will instead downsize plants,&#8221; Fujisawa said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low Ratios &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kosuke Kai, a spokesman for ExxonMobil Yugen Kaisha, which
holds a 50 percent stake in Tonen, said the company is reviewing
the new regulations and declined to comment further. Nelson
Toyomura, a spokesman for Petrobras unit Nansei Sekiyu, said the
company hasn&#8217;t determined what to do with its 100,000 barrel-a-
day plant on Okinawa island. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cosmo Oil spokesman Katsuhisa Maeda said he&#8217;s not sure how
the company will deal with the new rules. The Tokyo-based
refiner, 21 percent owned by the government of Abu Dhabi, has
started internal talks to decide how to make its refineries
competitive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies whose ratio of residue refining to crude
distillation is less than 10 percent will need to increase the
proportion by 45 percent by March 2014, according to the new
rules. Nansei Sekiyu, Cosmo Oil and TonenGeneral all fall into
that category, according to Bloomberg calculations based on
refinery data compiled by the Petroleum Association of Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Showa Shell &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Showa Shell Sekiyu K.K. will be the least affected among
Japanese refiners as it already has a relatively high ratio of
residue-processing capacity, said Hirofumi Kawachi, a senior
energy analyst at Mizuho Investors Securities Co. in Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has 88,000 barrels a day residue-processing
capacity compared with 515,000 barrels a day of crude
distillation, a ratio of about 17 percent, according to the
company&#8217;s website. That proportion will climb to 22 percent when
the company makes good on plans to shut permanently a 120,000
barrel-a-day crude unit by September 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refiners with a ratio between 10 percent and 13 percent
need to boost the proportion by 30 percent, and those with more
than 13 percent must increase the ratio by 15 percent, the trade
minister said in its announcement on July 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residue processing facilities such as coker units and
residue fluid catalytic crackers that can produce gasoline and
gasoil components from fuel oil cost around 100 billion yen
($1.1 billion) to build, making them too costly to be viable in
a market where fuel demand is declining, said Yuji Nishiyama, an
analyst at Credit Suisse in Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s domestic demand for fuels is likely to decline at a
rate of 3.5 percent a year through March 2015 because of a
shrinking population and a shift to energy conservation,
according to the trade ministry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The refiners may have to make more cuts if local demand
falls faster and steeper in the next decade,&#8221; said Shioda of
Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. was found liable for
not paying the U.K. creators of &#8220;Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire&#8221; their share of profits from the quiz show
broadcast on Disney&#8217;s ABC network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A jury in Riverside, California, today awarded $269.4
million in damages to Celador International Ltd. The jurors
agreed that Disney&#8217;s Buena Vista Television and ABC breached an
agreement that entitled Celador to 50 percent of the profits
from the show, which first aired in the U.S. in 1999 and helped
lift the network to first place from third in audience ratings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe this verdict is fundamentally wrong and will
aggressively seek to have it reversed,&#8221; Disney said in an
e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closely held Celador sued Disney in 2004, claiming Buena
Vista and ABC &#8220;through a complex web of self-dealing
transactions&#8221; allowed ABC to keep the advertising revenue and
pay Buena Vista only a licensing fee equal to the cost of
producing the show. That kept Buena Vista from earning a profit
from &#8220;Millionaire&#8221; that it would have had to share, Celador
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The moral of the story is people should honor their
contracts and treat others fairly,&#8221; Roman Silberfeld, a lawyer
for Celador, said outside the courtroom. &#8220;That is what this
jury said today. Even Disney is not immune.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third-Biggest Verdict &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verdict is the third-largest jury award in the U.S.
this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major studios have taken a hard line defending lawsuits
over profits and Disney in particular is notorious for its
aggressive legal strategy, said Michael Kump, a partner with
Kinsella Weitzman Iser Kump  Aldisert in Santa Monica,
California, who has litigated cases against Disney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Studios have been very reluctant to settle these kind of
cases,&#8221; Kump said in a phone interview. &#8220;They&#8217;re afraid of
setting a precedent and have every profit participant come after
them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To succeed on appeal, Disney will have to show that the
trial judge erred, possibly in instructing the jurors, Kump
said. Appellate courts generally are reluctant to overturn jury
verdicts, the lawyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, argued that the
creators, who received a flat producers&#8217; fee for each episode,
knew that the network run of &#8220;Millionaire&#8221; wouldn&#8217;t generate a
profit. There wasn&#8217;t anything unusual or secret about the way
Buena Vista and ABC, which took all the financial risks, divided
the rights, said Disney lawyer Martin Katz during the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger&#8217;s Criticism &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger said the judge
and the jury got it wrong and should have had more opportunity
to review the contract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s all there in the contract,&#8221; Iger said today in an
interview at the Allen  Co. media conference in Sun Valley,
Idaho. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quiz show came on the air in the U.S. in 1999 and its
success prompted ABC to run the program four times a week.
&#8220;Millionaire&#8221; was first broadcast in the U.K. in 1998 and has
been carried in 106 countries, including Australia, India,
Japan, Germany and Russia, according to the creators. The show
also was featured in the movie &#8220;Slumdog Millionaire,&#8221; which
was co-produced by Celador and which won eight Oscars in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eisner E-Mail &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Disney Chief Executive Officer Michael Eisner said
in a 1999 e-mail introduced by Celador as evidence in the trial
that &#8220;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&#8221; was as important to
Disney&#8217;s ABC network as its deal with the National Football
League. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eisner estimated the value of the rights to the game show
at $1 billion and said it would turn ABC around, according to a
separate 1999 e-mail message forwarded to Disney&#8217;s board of
directors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celador Chairman Paul Smith said in a phone interview that
the verdict was a great relief and that the company had been
willing to settle the case before it went to trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Disney did a fine, fine job producing and exploiting the
show,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;The problem was they exploited it for
their own benefit only.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Celador International Ltd. v. Walt Disney Co.

&lt;p&gt;Hercules Offshore Inc., owner of the
largest fleet of shallow-water drilling rigs in the Gulf of
Mexico, said its Hercules 120 rig began a well for Chevron Corp.
after receiving a federal permit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron yesterday revoked a June 23 notice that new
drilling rules following a Gulf of Mexico oil spill might cause
it to cancel its contract for the rig under a legal provision
known as force majeure, Houston-based Hercules said today in a
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Drilling began July 2, Hercules said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama suspended permits to drill in more
than 500 feet (152 meters) of water after the April 20 blowout
of the BP Plc well in the Gulf of Mexico. The administration on
June 8 tightened safety standards for drilling in waters less
than 500 feet deep. The Chevron permit is the 15th under the
revised shallow-water rules and the fourth for a new well,
Hercules General Counsel Jim Noe said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s an encouraging first step,&#8221; Noe said in an
interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s flow of permits that&#8217;s needed, not a trickle.
There are 50 available rigs in the Gulf of Mexico that are
working well-to-well and they continually need permits at a rate
of about 10 to 15 per week, not a handful every couple of
months.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The permit issued to Chevron by the Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management, successor to the regulatory arm of the U.S. Minerals
Management Service, is for a well in water 61 feet deep off
Louisiana, Noe said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack-Up Rigs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hercules has 30 jack-up rigs, according to its website.
Jack-ups are mobile drilling rigs that extend legs to the ocean
floor in shallow waters. Two others are under contract to
Chevron, one of which is finishing a well in Louisiana state
waters and the other is ready to start a well, Noe said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margaret J. Cooper, a spokeswoman for San Ramon,
California-based Chevron, had no immediate comment on the
Hercules filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About one in three shallow-water rigs in the Gulf are idle,
double the normal rate, Noe said in an interview last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hercules rose 26 cents, or 11 percent, to $2.54 at 4 p.m.
in Nasdaq trading. It has fallen 42 percent since the BP well
blowout, which caused the largest oil spill in U.S. history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron rose $1.89, or 2.8 percent, to $69.45 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares are down 9.8
percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     August, 2010 (Bloomberg Markets) -- Amid a storm of
criticism, government investigations and an SEC suit, the
investment bank&#8217;s outside directors have failed to speak out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg Palm, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. general counsel, took a
call in his 37th-floor office at One New York Plaza on Dec. 16,
2008. It was his old boss, Stephen Friedman, a former Goldman
chairman who was then head of the audit committee of its board
of directors. Goldman&#8217;s stock was down 65 percent from its 52-
week high during an accelerating global financial breakdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedman, who had become chairman of the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York that year, told Palm he wanted to buy,
Bloomberg Markets magazine reports in its August issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palm says he couldn&#8217;t think of a reason why Friedman
shouldn&#8217;t: Goldman had made the necessary disclosures in that
day&#8217;s filings, Palm says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;d just reported earnings,&#8221; says Palm, whose job
includes approving trades by directors. &#8220;There was no material
information that wasn&#8217;t public from Goldman&#8217;s standpoint.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedman, 72, who is still a Goldman director, bought
37,300 shares at an average of $80.78 each on Dec. 17. Five
weeks later, he picked up 15,300 more at an average of $66.61.
By yesterday, the stock had doubled to $133.76, giving Friedman
a paper profit of $3 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the U.S. House Oversight and Government Reform
Committee is investigating Friedman&#8217;s stock purchases. It wants
to know why he was permitted to buy stock in a bank he was
regulating as chairman of the New York Fed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedman held both that post and his Goldman board seat
when the firm became a bank holding company in September 2008.
The Federal Reserve Act forbids an official at the New York Fed
in his position from also being a director of a bank or buying
its stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Perfectly Legal&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Fed sought a waiver from the Federal Reserve
Board in September 2008 so that Friedman could keep his position
there. Michele Davis, a spokeswoman for Friedman, says New York
Fed general counsel Tom Baxter told Friedman that the rules were
in abeyance while the waiver was pending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Therefore, Mr. Friedman&#8217;s purchases of Goldman Sachs
stock were perfectly legal,&#8221; she says. The waiver was granted
in January 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Jordan, a former president of the Cleveland Fed, says
the section of the Federal Reserve Act barring Friedman from
owning bank stock or buying new shares could not be waived. &#8220;It
was not allowed,&#8221; he says. &#8220;You can&#8217;t get permission to
violate the law.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping Mum &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s ties to the New York Fed pose another
potential conflict for Friedman, says James Cox, a professor at
Duke University School of Law. Goldman was a prime beneficiary
of the New York Fed-engineered bailout of American International
Group Inc.&#8217;s bank counterparties, receiving, by its own count,
$12.9 billion for the credit protection it held on mortgage-
related securities. That figure was not publicly disclosed by
AIG until March 2009 -- after Friedman had bought his shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It raises at the least an eyebrow in terms of what he
knew about those payments,&#8221; Cox says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York Fed spokesman Jack Gutt responds: &#8220;Friedman had
no involvement in nor was he provided with confidential
information related to the New York Fed&#8217;s negotiation with any
AIG counterparties.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedman resigned from the New York Fed on May 7, 2009,
days after the Wall Street Journal reported his stock buying. At
the time, Baxter said in a statement, &#8220;It is my view that these
purchases did not violate any Federal Reserve statute, rule or
policy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Friedman saga unfolds -- and Goldman&#8217;s regulatory
and legal entanglements escalate -- the firm&#8217;s nine outside
directors, who aren&#8217;t Goldman employees, are keeping mum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Completely Unfounded&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board members said nothing publicly, for instance,
when on April 16 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
filed a civil suit alleging Goldman had committed fraud in
underwriting and marketing a mortgage-related security called
Abacus 2007-AC1 without disclosing to clients that a bearish
hedge fund customer, Paulson  Co., was involved in creating it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman calls the SEC suit &#8220;completely unfounded.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors in New York are also investigating
Goldman transactions to determine whether to pursue a criminal
fraud case, according to two people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nell Minow, co-founder of the Portland, Maine-based
Corporate Library, a governance research firm, says that when
the SEC suit was filed, the outside directors should have
immediately set up a committee to investigate, hired independent
counsel and announced that they would make the results of their
probe public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Notice &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board should also have been riding herd on its members&#8217;
stock trades, says Cornell University Law School Professor
Robert Hockett, who specializes in financial regulation from his
office in Ithaca, New York. Goldman spokesman Lucas van Praag
says directors are periodically informed of such trades. The
bank received a Wells notice dated July 28, 2009, notifying the
firm that it was the target of an SEC fraud investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least three company executives, including Vice Chairman
Michael Evans, unloaded more than $27 million of Goldman stock
from October 2009 through February 2010 in open market sales
unrelated to the recent exercise of options or delivery of
restricted stock, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van Praag says Goldman&#8217;s board was informed of the Wells
notice, which was not made public until after the SEC filed its
suit. He says the firm&#8217;s lawyers determined it wasn&#8217;t material. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;On the face of it, the idea that that would not be
material -- I can&#8217;t imagine anybody saying that with a straight
face,&#8221; Hockett says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11-Hour Hearing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacob Zamansky of Zamansky  Associates LLC filed a class-
action lawsuit on April 30 on behalf of Goldman shareholders,
saying that Goldman made false statements relating to the SEC
suit and failed to disclose adverse facts about the company to
shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Wells notice was a material fact going to the heart
of their business,&#8221; he says. Goldman had not formally responded
to the suit as of late June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of issues Goldman executives, and their board,
need to address continues to build. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Director Rajat Gupta did not stand for re-election to the
board in May. U.S. investigators suspect him of leaking word of
a $5 billion investment in Goldman by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. in
2008, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary Naftalis, a lawyer for Gupta, former worldwide
managing director of McKinsey  Co., says, &#8220;Rajat Gupta has
never violated any law or rule.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Billion Pages &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 27, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations held an 11-hour hearing on Goldman&#8217;s role in the
financial meltdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman repeatedly put its own interests and profits
ahead of the interests of its clients and our communities,&#8221;
Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, said at the hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We respectfully disagree,&#8221; van Praag says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 7, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission
subpoenaed Goldman, accusing it of attempting to hinder its
probe of the firm by electronically sending it the equivalent of
more than a billion pages of documents. Yesterday the leaders of
the commission told journalists in a conference call that the
firm has become more responsive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The outside directors haven&#8217;t been visible on any of
this,&#8221; says Patrick McGurn, special counsel at RiskMetrics
Group, a New York adviser to shareholders. &#8220;You have to ask if
it&#8217;s setting the correct ethical tone.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van Praag says: &#8220;Board chairman Lloyd Blankfein has made
the views of the board well-known.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking Out &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s board consists of two insiders, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Blankfein and President Gary Cohn, and
nine outsiders. There are five scheduled meetings per year and
more as needed, the company says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outside directors are: Friedman; Lois Juliber, 61,
former vice chairman of Colgate-Palmolive Co.; William George,
67, ex-CEO of Medtronic Inc.; Lakshmi Mittal, 60, CEO of
steelmaker ArcelorMittal; John Bryan, 73, ex-CEO of Sara Lee
Corp.; Lee Scott, 61, ex-CEO of Wal-Mart Stores Inc.; Claes Dahlback, 63, ex-CEO of Sweden&#8217;s Investor AB; James Johnson, 66,
vice chairman of merchant bank Perseus LLC and former CEO of
Fannie Mae; and James Schiro, 64, former head of insurer Zurich
Financial Services AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directors who completed a full year in 2009 were paid an
average of $460,852 in stock and options compared with $255,519
in cash and stock for JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s 10 outside
directors and $337,803 for Morgan Stanley&#8217;s 11 outsiders,
proxies show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s board may have been able to preempt criticism of
the company by speaking out, says Sean Coffey, a former partner
at Bernstein Litowitz Berger  Grossmann LLP, who&#8217;s running for
New York state attorney general. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shopping at Walmart &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board should have established a committee of outside
directors with an independent counsel to investigate ethics
matters and get the facts, says Coffey, who won more than $50
million from WorldCom Inc. directors in a 2005 settlement with
the telecom company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The right decision might be to take out advertisements
and apologize or it might be to batten down the hatches,&#8221;
Coffey says. &#8220;Don&#8217;t omit disclosing material information that
investors ought to know.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minow says the Goldman board should have nominated someone
who had securities law enforcement experience, who could have
led an internal investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, in March, Goldman nominated -- and shareholders
later approved -- the appointment of Walmart&#8217;s Scott. After an
exchange in which a person at the May 7 annual meeting asked how
Scott had been selected, CEO Blankfein deadpanned, &#8220;Actually, I
like shopping at Walmart.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nine-Person Board &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the meeting, Goldman announced the creation of an
internal committee that will examine possible conflicts of
interest and other issues such as transparency and disclosure.
It&#8217;s headed by Vice Chairman Evans and E. Gerald Corrigan,
chairman of Goldman Sachs Bank USA. No board members are
involved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former EBay CEO Meg Whitman, who joined Goldman&#8217;s board in
2001, says then-CEO Henry Paulson brushed aside her questions to
move a meeting along. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They wanted to keep acting like a group of partners who
did much of their discussion and decision-making in private and
then expected to get the board&#8217;s rubber stamp,&#8221; Whitman writes
in her new book, The Power of Many (Crown, 2010). She resigned
after 15 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitman is now the Republican candidate for governor of
California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cornell&#8217;s Hockett says that if Friedman violated any laws,
the entire Goldman board is to blame. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Boards are intended to police the actions of their
members,&#8221; he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class C &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedman spokesperson Davis says the waiver exonerates him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Fed&#8217;s nine-person board consists of three
classes of directors serving staggered terms. Class A directors
are elected by member banks to represent commercial banks; one
class A director today is JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. Class B directors are elected by member banks to
represent the public, while class C directors such as Friedman,
who also represent the public, are appointed by the Fed Board of
Governors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Cleveland Fed President Jordan says the law is
clear: As a Class C director, Friedman could not own, much less
buy, bank stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 4, Number 15 of the Federal Reserve Act reads, &#8220;No
director of class C shall be an officer, director, employee, or
stockholder of any bank.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Fed argued that because Goldman was a bank
holding company and not a bank, a waiver could be granted,
according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The Fed
agreed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares Surge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much the Goldman board&#8217;s silence in the face of
adversity has cost the firm is difficult to gauge. Goldman
shares have surged 157 percent as of June 29 since hitting an
all-time low in November 2008. In May, shareholders approved
those directors standing for election by margins of more than 95
percent or greater. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, says Coffey, the board&#8217;s somnolence in the face of
so much controversy has done nothing to support Goldman&#8217;s
storied franchise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 10-year Treasury yield is fair

justify yields at 2.5 percent or below, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to stand by our long-held forecast of 3.25
percent for 3-to-6 months,&#8221; the company said in an e-mailed

&lt;p&gt;The 10-year yield was little changed at 2.93 percent as of

&lt;p&gt;Ford Motor Co. Chief Executive
Officer Alan Mulally and Walt Disney Co. CEO Robert Iger are
among 18 executives President Barack Obama will name today to an
advisory group on increasing U.S. exports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Boosting America&#8217;s exports strengthens our economic
growth and supports millions of good, high-paying American
jobs,&#8221; Obama said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama created the Export Council earlier this year and laid
out a goal of doubling U.S. exports during the next five years.
Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said yesterday that
agricultural exports increased 19 percent during this year&#8217;s
first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president is scheduled to speak today about progress on
increasing U.S. exports, highlighting 18 trade missions
coordinated by the Department of Commerce, loans from the U.S.
Export-Import Bank that have helped support almost 110,000 jobs,
and new agreements on exports of U.S. agricultural products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The White House said Obama will name members to the export
council to join Boeing Co. Chairman and CEO James McNerney and
Xerox Corp. Chairman and CEO Ursula Burns, who were picked in
March to lead the group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appointees to the council, the White House said, will
include: United Parcel Service Inc. Chairman and CEO Scott Davis; MetLife Inc. Chairman and CEO Robert Henrikson; Pfizer
Inc. Chairman and CEO Jeffrey Kindler; Verizon Communications
Inc. Chairman and CEO Ivan Seidenberg; Archer Daniels Midland
Co. Chairman and CEO Patricia Woertz; and UAL Corp. Chairman and
CEO Glenn Tilton. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc hired Peter Ding and
Gary Kuo from Morgan Stanley to jointly run its Greater China
investment-banking unit, said two people with knowledge of the
appointments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Ding, the former co-head of mergers and acquisitions
for Asia-Pacific outside Japan at Morgan Stanley, and the Wall
Street firm&#8217;s former Taiwan Chairman Gary Kuo will become co-
heads of investment banking for China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, the
people said, declining to be identified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ding and Kuo bring the number of senior executives in Asia
leaving Morgan Stanley for London-based Barclays to four in the
past year. Barclays today said it hired Vanessa Koo from Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and BNP Paribas SA&#8217;s James Lim as the U.K. bank
builds its investment-banking business in Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timothy Cuffe, a spokesman at Barclays in Hong Kong,
declined to comment. Morgan Stanley spokeswoman Noel Cheung
confirmed the departure of Ding, 43, and said Samuel Kim will
become the firm&#8217;s sole head of MA for Asia-Pacific outside
Japan. She declined to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuo left Morgan Stanley last month, company spokesman Nick Footitt said in a July 2 interview. Ding joined Morgan Stanley
in early 2008 and Kuo had been with the bank since March 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edward King resigned as Morgan Stanley&#8217;s head of MA for
Asia-Pacific last month to take up the same position at Barclays,
people with knowledge of the move said at the time. Matthew Ginsburg joined Barclays in September last year as head of
investment banking in the region, a role he previously held at
Morgan Stanley. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. agreed to give

programs including Windows 7 and Office 2010 in a bid to boost
sales to the government, Vedomosti reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSB, the main successor to the Soviet-era KGB, will now
be able to certify Microsoft&#8217;s operating system as a whole,
rather than individual applications, which will clear the
company to win more state orders, the Moscow-based newspaper
said today, citing an unidentified company official. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft had about $1 billion of sales in Russia last

contracts, Vedomosti said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corporate profits may grow at the
slowest pace of the year in the third quarter as an economic
recovery that&#8217;s short on jobs and consumer demand curbs income
at companies from Chevron Corp. to 3M Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings at Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index companies may rise
25 percent in the three months through September, compared with
projected gains of 34 percent for the just-ended second quarter,
according to analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Per-
share earnings rose 52 percent from January through March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve got players out there that are suffering from
Armageddon hypochondria,&#8221; said James Paulsen, chief investment
strategist of Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, which
oversees $375 billion. Instead of portending an economic crisis,
the slower profit growth is &#8220;your commonplace, very normal mid-
cycle soft patch in the recovery.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial-market turmoil has increased risks to the
recovery, the International Monetary Fund said yesterday, while
predicting the world economy will grow 4.6 percent this year,
the most since 2007. In the U.S., the SP 500 dropped 12 percent
from April through June as unemployment averaged 9.7 percent and
new home sales slumped to the lowest pace on record in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index may post average
profit gains of 57 percent this year, dwindling to 22 percent in
2011, based on analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Luxury
carmakers such as Daimler AG are benefiting from the euro&#8217;s
slide against the dollar, while the euro&#8217;s weakness against the
yen may have curbed earnings at Japanese technology firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global Indicators &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales at non-financial companies will be the best
indicators of the economy&#8217;s health worldwide, said Sinan Akiman,
chief investment officer at Istanbul-based Garanti Asset
Management, which oversees $4.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If there is no, or very limited, increase in sales of
non-financial companies, that means the economy is still not
recovering,&#8221; Akiman said. &#8220;We should especially look at big
retail industry companies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., earnings gains for SP 500 companies will
continue through the second half of 2010 and average 34 percent
for the full year, analysts surveyed by Bloomberg project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our economy is beginning to repair itself, but it&#8217;s by no
means ready to run a marathon,&#8221; said Matt McCormick of
Cincinnati-based Bahl  Gaynor Inc., which has $2.8 billion
under management. &#8220;I do see earnings growth, but it&#8217;s not going
to be broad based.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcoa Inc., the first company in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average to report earnings for the second quarter, may post a
profit for the first time in three quarters on July 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials Companies &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcoa, based in New York, and other commodities companies
may see earnings growth of 46 percent in the three months
through September, down from a projected 93 percent gain in the
second quarter, analysts estimated. The estimates rank that
sector among the top performers of the SP 500. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial companies are predicted to post an average gain
of 54 percent in the third quarter, with increases of 36 percent
for information technology firms and 39 percent for energy
companies. The estimates all represent declines from the quarter
that ended in June, when those sectors are projected to have
grown 84 percent, 53 percent and 73 percent, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In energy, fuel demand may be stunted at Chevron, Exxon
Mobil Corp. and ConocoPhillips, the largest U.S. oil companies.
New York oil futures, which traded as high as $87.15 a barrel in
May, dropped to as low as $71.09 this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lid on Oil Prices &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Between the consumer and worldwide industrial demand,
there&#8217;s probably a lid on the price of oil for the time being,&#8221;
said Barry James, who manages more than $2 billion, including
shares of all three major U.S. oil companies, at James
Investment Research in Xenia, Ohio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Ramon, California-based Chevron&#8217;s net income may more
than double for the second quarter, then slow to about 10
percent this quarter, analysts estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the world&#8217;s biggest publicly traded company, Irving,
Texas-based Exxon Mobil, third-quarter profit will probably
climb 40 percent after a predicted jump of 70 percent in the
second quarter, according to analysts&#8217; average estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London-based BP Plc, which is trying to cap a Gulf of
Mexico well leaking as much as 60,000 barrels of oil a day, may
see net income plunge more than 40 percent this quarter after a
similar projected drop in the three months through June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts have trimmed estimates for U.S. financial
companies in the past month in response to weaker revenue from
trading and investment banking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial Companies &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There won&#8217;t be any standout companies reporting to the
upside, and there could be some real shockers on the downside,&#8221;
said Dick Bove, a Lutz, Florida-based analyst at Rochdale
Securities LLC. Investment banking, trading and retail sales of
financial products &#8220;suffered severe reversals from the first
quarter,&#8221; when four of the largest U.S. banks reported zero
days of trading losses, Bove said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Goldman Sachs Group Inc., earnings may fall to $2.30 a
share in the second quarter from $5.71 in the year-earlier
period and $5.59 in the first three months of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology companies benefited from rebounding consumer
demand in the first half and relatively easy comparisons to the
year-earlier period, said Shaw Wu, a San Francisco-based analyst
at Kaufman Bros. &#8220;There are signs things are slowing down
somewhat&#8221; for the second half, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. may report fiscal third-quarter net income of
about $2.8 billion on July 20, analysts estimate. The Cupertino,
California-based company posted profit of $3.1 billion in the
quarter through March, a gain of 90 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple&#8217;s Attraction &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Apple helped drive a consumer recovery,&#8221; Wu said. &#8220;The
attractiveness of their products got people into stores.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income at Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft Corp. may
rise 24 percent to about $4.1 billion in the three months
through June as demand for personal computers continues to
recover faster than initial forecasts from market research firm
Gartner Inc. Sales at the world&#8217;s largest software maker may
rise 16 percent, the most in two years, according to the average
estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc., grappling with slowing growth of search
engine-related advertising, enters the second half facing
stronger rivals including Facebook Inc., Yahoo! Inc. and
Microsoft, said Caris  Co. analyst Sandeep Aggarwal in San
Francisco. In addition, a stronger dollar will hurt Google in
Europe, where the company gets about 35 percent of its revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese Technology &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese technology companies&#8217; earnings were likely
crimped by the yen&#8217;s strength against the euro, putting them at
a disadvantage to Asian rivals, even as demand for products such
as semiconductors and flat-screen televisions recovers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yen strengthened 17 percent against the euro in the
April-June period, the best performer among 17 major currencies
tracked by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The currency will certainly help non-Japanese Asian
manufacturers,&#8221; said David Huo, who helps oversee $1.2 billion
at RBC Investment Management (Asia) Ltd. in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony Corp. will likely report a narrower loss in the
quarter ended June 30 from a year earlier, after the Tokyo-based
maker of Bravia televisions fired workers and shut factories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per-share profit growth at Oak Brook, Illinois-based
McDonald&#8217;s Corp., the world&#8217;s largest restaurant company, may
narrow in the second quarter as well as the second half,
according to analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking Stable Names &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McDonald&#8217;s and companies such as General Mills Inc., the
maker of Lucky Charms cereal, still appeal to investors as the
economy will probably grow about 2 percent this year, said Keith Wirtz, who oversees $18 billion as chief investment officer at
Fifth Third Asset Management Inc. in Cincinnati. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We want names that are going to be stable and true,&#8221;
Wirtz said in an interview. &#8220;We think companies like McDonald&#8217;s
will become more coveted.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;St. Paul, Minnesota-based 3M, the maker of 55,000 products
including Scotch tape, may post 21 percent per-share profit
growth for the just-ended period, based on the average
estimates. Analysts predict growth will steadily decrease in the
second half amid tougher comparisons and fewer sales of
respiratory masks used last year to ward off the H1N1 flu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;2010 is kind of a twisted year: First half, huge growth,
second half, not as big but still growing,&#8221; said Ajay Kejriwal,
a New York-based analyst with FBR Capital Markets who has an
&#8220;outperform&#8221; rating on 3M shares. &#8220;We are saying, &#8216;Look beyond
the second half. The long term picture is much brighter.&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among automotive companies, Ford Motor Co. may post its
fifth straight quarterly net profit, its longest streak since
2005. Second-quarter net income may be about $1.6 billion at the
Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker, according to estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford and Toyota &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;ve gained enough market share to offset some
potential weakness in the North American market,&#8221; Brian Johnson, a Chicago-based auto analyst for Barclays Capital, said
in an interview. &#8220;We think Ford earnings are secure given their
demonstrated ability to increase market share.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toyota Motor Corp., Honda Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Co.,
Japan&#8217;s three largest automakers, will probably see improvements
in the three months ended June 30 as car demand recovered from a
recession in the U.S. and surged in China, according to three
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Last year was an abnormal one, so results will be far
better,&#8221; said Koji Endo, a Tokyo-based analyst at Advanced
Research Japan, who estimates Toyota will report operating
profit of 100 billion yen ($1.14 billion) to 150 billion yen.
The carmaker posted a 77.8 billion yen loss a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Europe, mass-market manufacturers are grappling with
expiring government sales incentives while luxury makers are
taking advantage of surging demand in China, according to
Munich-based UniCredit&#8217;s Georg Stuerzer, who is ranked first
among analysts of German luxury-car makers tracked by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daimler, BMW &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daimler, the maker of Mercedes-Benz cars, probably boosted
second-quarter sales by 19 percent to 23.3 billion euros ($29.3
billion), according to Stuerzer. Full-year revenue may climb 10
percent to 87.2 billion euros, the average of 28 analysts&#8217;
estimates. Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, the largest maker of
luxury cars, may boost annual revenue for the first time in
three years, analyst estimates show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BMW and Daimler, which both have production plants in the
U.S., also benefit from the growing value of sales from the
world&#8217;s second-largest national auto market amid the euro&#8217;s
decline, according to Stuerzer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. industrial companies may see profit gains widen to 34
percent this quarter from 15 percent in the past three months,
analysts estimate. The sector, which includes companies from 3M
to General Electric Co. and Boeing Co., may see an average
earnings increase of 15 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrial Companies &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GE, the world&#8217;s biggest maker of jet engines and medical-
imaging equipment, may post per-share profit of 27 cents a
share, little-changed from last year&#8217;s 26 cents, based on the
average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alstom SA, the French maker of power-generation turbines,
high-speed trains and trams, expects operating profit to be
lower in fiscal 2011 and 2012 than in the 12 months through
March. CEO Patrick Kron said in June the pace and scale of
Europe&#8217;s recovery are unclear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second quarter will yield &#8220;very, very good results for
the industrial sector, thanks to exports to emerging markets and
destocking,&#8221; Gael de-Bray, an analyst at Societe Generale in
Paris, said in a July 5 interview. Alstom will be among the few
exceptions, he said, partly because of a &#8220;pronounced wait-and-
see attitude at utilities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects fourth paragraph to say Burkle and Weinsteins are
considering a bid.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Construction executive Ronald Tutor
is in discussions to buy Walt Disney Co.&#8217;s Miramax film
division, with backing from private equity firm Colony Capital,
according to two people with knowledge of the talks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negotiations are continuing almost around the clock, said
one of the people, who asked not to be named because the talks
are private. If consummated, an agreement could be announced by
next week, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tutor approached Colony prior to the July 4 weekend seeking
financing, said one person with knowledge of the arrangement.
Los Angeles-based Colony, led by chairman and CEO Tom Barrack,
has investments that include Michael Jackson&#8217;s Neverland ranch
in Santa Barbara. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Los Angeles investor Ron Burkle and Miramax founders Harvey
and Bob Weinstein, who were working on a $625 million offer, are
weighing whether to put in a competing bid, said two other
people with knowledge of the situation. They had ended talks
with Disney in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Weinsteins sold Miramax to Disney in 1993. The two, who
left in 2005, control rights to some films and are acquainted
with both Tutor and Barrack, according to one of the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney is seeking $600 million to $700 million for Miramax,
producer of &#8220;The English Patient&#8221; and &#8220;Shakespeare in Love,&#8221;
said one of the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tutor, chairman and chief executive of Sylmar, California-
based Tutor Perini Corp., didn&#8217;t return calls seeking comment.
Disney spokeswoman Zenia Mucha declined to comment on the talks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead Negotiators &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harvey Weinstein, in Sun Valley, Idaho, for media banker
Allen  Co.&#8217;s annual conference, declined to discuss Miramax
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think it&#8217;s better for me to not say anything,&#8221;
Weinstein said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading negotiations for Colony is Richard Nanula, who was
chief financial officer at Disney when it purchased Miramax,
said the person. Nanula is negotiating with Kevin Mayer,
Disney&#8217;s executive vice president for corporate strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talks were reported yesterday by the Web site
Deadline.com/Hollywood and by Reuters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney gained 20 cents to $33.34 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. It has advanced 3.4 percent
this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest
publicly traded company, plans to buy back $3 billion of its
shares this quarter, easing the effect on shareholders from its
takeover of natural-gas producer XTO Energy Inc., and said it
will pay off or refinance the deal&#8217;s assumed debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $25 billion purchase last month increased outstanding
shares at Irving, Texas-based Exxon Mobil, by 416 million, or
about 9 percent, David Rosenthal, vice president for investor
relations, said today during a conference call with analysts.
The company also will pay off or refinance $11 billion of
assumed debt when the opportunity presents, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal made Exxon Mobil the largest U.S. producer of
clean-burning gas, which Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson
expects to be the fastest-growing fuel for more than two
decades. He kept almost all of XTO&#8217;s 3,300 employees and said a
team in its former Fort Worth headquarters will spend up to 18
months setting drilling priorities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Now that we&#8217;ve got this in-house, we want to look at what
are the optimization steps that could be taken,&#8221; Tillerson said
on the call. &#8220;We don&#8217;t have to be driven by all the aspects
that XTO standalone was.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil is ending XTO&#8217;s practice of locking in oil and
gas prices for future production and instead will use its
traditional yardstick of return on capital, Tillerson said. At
the same time, XTO was more efficient than Exxon Mobil at
drilling onshore wells such as those in the Permian Basin of
West Texas, Tillerson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unconventional Bet &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The XTO purchase is a long-term bet that gas from shale
formations, coal seams and other so-called unconventional
sources will meet rising U.S. demand through at least 2030 as
output from conventional wells declines, Tillerson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil acquired the equivalent of at least 45 trillion
cubic feet of recoverable gas beneath 3.34 million U.S. acres
with the purchase, along with expertise to evaluate 4.8 million
acres of potential fields already accumulated outside the U.S.,
Tillerson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unconventional assets include oil and gas trapped in
dense, hard rock such as shale, considered not worth drilling
until Texas oil-patch billionaire George Mitchell developed
methods to extract gas economically in the 1990s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil rose 38 cents to $58.81 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have fallen 14
percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan
Stanley profit estimates were lowered by Meredith Whitney
Advisory Group LLC, following similar cuts by other research
analysts as markets fell and business demand shriveled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitney cut her estimate for Goldman Sachs&#8217;s second-quarter
earnings per share to $1.70 from an earlier forecast of $4.75
and reduced her estimate for Morgan Stanley to 40 cents from 68
cents, according to a report from her New York-based firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimates for earnings have tumbled during recent weeks as
stock markets dropped amid a return of risk aversion by
investors. Analysts including Douglas Sipkin at Ticonderoga
Securities and Guy Moszkowski at Bank of America Corp. have
slashed earnings forecasts because of a lower revenue outlook
and higher costs related to legal expenses and a U.K. bonus tax. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitney&#8217;s cuts are &#8220;due to a heinous trading environment&#8221;
and &#8220;lower than anticipated investment-banking activity,&#8221; she
said in the July 7 note to investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second quarter &#8220;was the worst quarter for debt and
equity underwriting volume in over a year as volatility spiked,
and global equity indices recorded the steepest quarterly
declines since&#8221; the fourth quarter 2008, she wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
is for New York-based Goldman Sachs to earn $2.30 per share in
the second quarter, with forecasts of $1.60 per share to $3.21
per share. Goldman Sachs earned $5.59 per share in the first
quarter of 2010 and $4.93 per share in the second quarter of
2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full-Year Estimates &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitney also lowered her estimates for Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
third and fourth-quarter earnings to $3.77 and $4.64 from $4.24
and $5.42, respectively. She expects the firm to earn $15.70 in
2010, down from an earlier estimate of $20 a share, while the
2011 forecast was reduced to $19.50 from $22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average estimate of 11 analysts is for Morgan Stanley
to earn 48 cents, with a range of 39 cents to 58 cents. Last
quarter the New York-based firm earned 82 cents a share, while
it lost $1.37 a share a year earlier. Whitney cut her full-year
2010 estimate to $2.62 per share from $2.90 and lowered the 2011
estimate to $3 from $3.05. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitney has a &#8220;neutral&#8221; rating on both Goldman Sachs and
Morgan Stanley stock. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The head of the Argentine agency
dedicated to fighting money laundering asked prosecutors to
investigate whether JPMorgan Chase  Co. and three companies
manipulated prices of public share offerings, the agency said in
a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jose Sbatella, the head of Argentina&#8217;s Financial
Information Unit, sought a probe into share sales by Grupo
Clarin SA, Banco Patagonia SA and Consultatio SA after receiving
testimony from former JPMorgan employee Hernan Arbizu, the
statement said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan participated in share sales by the three Buenos
Aires-based companies, the statement added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arbizu, an Argentine, fled the U.S. in 2008 after being
indicted for embezzlement. He has been sued by the bank for
allegedly stealing money from a client account and taking
confidential information about customers. Arbizu said in an
interview in Buenos Aires last year that the charges against him
are true and that he didn&#8217;t profit from the transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The complaint has no grounds,&#8221; Clarin said by e-mail.
&#8220;The offerings were made in London and Buenos Aires according
to all international norms.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We hope this ends quickly to make clear we acted
according to the law,&#8221; Eduardo Costantini, chairman of
Consultatio, said in a phone interview today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kazakhstan&#8217;s Prosecutor General&#8217;s
Office found that Chevron Corp.&#8217;s biggest venture in the country
produced 212 billion tenge ($1.4 billion) of oil illegally,
according to the economic crimes agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors discovered the violation while investigating
TengizChevroil LLP, the Astana-based agency said in a faxed
statement today. A decision on possible sanctions will follow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The venture may face a fine for &#8220;illegal oil production,&#8221;
the Central Asian country&#8217;s Oil and Gas Ministry said in June.
The ministry had asked the prosecutor&#8217;s office to investigate
after Kazakhstan&#8217;s biggest oil exporter pumped oil from a depth
that&#8217;s not allowed by law, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Svetlana Kairgalieva, an Atyrau-based spokeswoman for
TengizChevroil, declined to comment when reached by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, holds 50 percent
of TengizChevroil. Exxon Mobil Corp. has 25 percent,
Kazakhstan&#8217;s state-run KazMunaiGaz National Co. owns 20 percent
and Lukarco, owned by Russia&#8217;s OAO Lukoil, 5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. was found liable for
not paying the U.K. creators of &#8220;Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire&#8221; their share of profits from the quiz show
broadcast on Disney&#8217;s ABC network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal court jury in Riverside, California, yesterday
awarded $269.4 million in damages to Celador International Ltd.
The jurors agreed that Disney&#8217;s Buena Vista Television and ABC
breached an agreement that entitled Celador to 50 percent of the
profits from the show, which first aired in the U.S. in 1999 and
helped lift the network to first place from third in audience
ratings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe this verdict is fundamentally wrong and will
aggressively seek to have it reversed,&#8221; Disney said in an e-
mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closely held Celador sued Disney in 2004, claiming Buena
Vista and ABC &#8220;through a complex web of self-dealing
transactions&#8221; allowed ABC to keep the advertising revenue and
pay Buena Vista only a licensing fee equal to the cost of
producing the show. That kept Buena Vista from earning a profit
from &#8220;Millionaire&#8221; that it would have had to share, Celador
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, argued that the
creators, who received a flat producers&#8217; fee for each episode,
knew that the network run of &#8220;Millionaire&#8221; wouldn&#8217;t generate a
profit. There wasn&#8217;t anything unusual or secret about the way
Buena Vista and ABC, which took all the financial risks, divided
the rights, said Disney lawyer Martin Katz during the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Celador International Ltd. v. Walt Disney Co.

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Former Marsh Executives&#8217; Convictions Tossed in Bid-Rig Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A New York judge threw out the criminal convictions against
two former Marsh  McLennan Cos. executives whom he found guilty
of restraint of trade in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State Supreme Court Justice James Yates in Manhattan tossed
the convictions against William Gilman and Edward McNenney,
former managing directors at Marsh, in a July 2 written
decision. The pair were accused of fixing prices to steer
business to insurers that paid Marsh hidden fees from November
1998 to September 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision was the latest loss for the New York Attorney
General&#8217;s office in its six-year probe of anti-competitive sales
practices in the insurance industry. The case, begun under
former state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, was tried under his
successor, Andrew Cuomo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failures by prosecutors, including &#8220;newly discovered
contradictory evidence, undermines the court&#8217;s confidence in the
verdict,&#8221; Yates wrote in his decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yates found the two men guilty in February 2008 of a single
count of restraint of trade under New York&#8217;s antitrust statutes
after a 10-month trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are reviewing the decision and contemplating an
appeal,&#8221; Richard Bamberger, a spokesman for Cuomo, said in an
e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attorney general&#8217;s office, following a 2004 probe,
alleged that McNenney, Gilman and six other Marsh Global Broking
Inc. brokers took part in a conspiracy to fraudulently obtain
millions of dollars for Marsh and its accomplice companies by
rigging the market for excess casualty insurance, according to a
redacted copy of the 25-page decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gilman, formerly Marsh&#8217;s executive marketing director and
managing director, and McNenney, the former global placement
director and managing director, worked in the Excess Casualty
Unit of Marsh Global Broking, a Marsh Inc. unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, Yates allowed former Marsh employees Robert
Stearns and Kathryn Winter and former Zurich Financial Services
AG employee James Spiegel to withdraw their guilty pleas to
felony charges of participating in a scheme to defraud. The
judge agreed to reduce the charges to misdemeanors and said he
would dismiss the charges if the three abided by plea
agreements. Yates also dismissed charges against six people who
previously pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges related to
alleged bid-rigging. &lt;/p&gt;

arbitrators found the firm gave them only a &#8220;fleeting and
slapdash&#8221; explanation of a municipal bond fund that imploded

fund they designed, the panel found. The firm also inadequately
trained a saleswoman who dealt with the Levinthals, and didn&#8217;t
ensure they understood the investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The education offered to the Levinthals &#8220;was fleeting and
slapdash,&#8221; arbitrators wrote. &#8220;An investment in a highly
complex and concededly risky product like the fund, sold in this
fashion, is by definition unsuitable&#8221; for someone with their
experience and objectives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg Berardi, a spokesman for the San Francisco-based
company, declined to comment. Bank of America Corp. acquired
First Republic Bank while buying Merrill Lynch  Co. last year,
and sold it last week to an investor group that included founder
James H. Herbert II. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elliott Levinthal, 88, is a professor emeritus of
mechanical engineering at Stanford. He and his wife endowed
Levinthal Hall, a lecture hall at the Stanford Humanities
Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel ordered First Republic Securities to pay the
couple and their trust $2.1 million in compensatory damages,
plus $78,153 in fees and expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 35 retail mutual funds marketed as leveraged
municipal arbitrage strategies have failed in recent years, said
Craig McCann of the Securities and Litigation Consulting Group
Inc., a Virginia consulting firm that testified for the
Levinthals in the arbitration. Brokerage firms sold the funds as
&#8220;higher-yielding alternatives to conventional municipal bond
portfolios with little, if any risk,&#8221; he said in a 2009 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skilled Healthcare Falls After $671 Million Verdict &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skilled Healthcare Group Inc. plunged the most since its
initial public offering in New York trading after a California
jury returned a $671 million jury verdict against the nursing-
home operator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skilled Healthcare dropped $4.70, or 76 percent, to $1.52
yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, the largest intraday
decline since the shares went on sale in May 2007. They peaked
in August 2008 at $17.17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs accused Skilled Healthcare of improperly
staffing 22 California facilities. A Humboldt County jury July 6
found the company liable for $613 million in statutory damages,
the maximum allowed by state law, and $58 million for
restitution. Skilled Healthcare, based in Foothill Ranch,
California, said yesterday it will appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We strongly disagree with the outcome of this legal
matter and we intend to vigorously challenge it,&#8221; Chief
Executive Officer Boyd Hendrickson said in a statement. The
company believes &#8220;our facilities are appropriately staffed,&#8221;
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verdict is the largest jury award in the U.S. this
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Skilled
Healthcare said the award exceeds the policy limits of its
insurance. The jury will return later to determine punitive
damages, said the company, which posted a net loss of $133
million last year on revenue of $759.8 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was filed in 2006 on behalf of current and
former residents of 22 Skilled Healthcare operations in
California, plaintiffs&#8217; attorney Tim Needham said. California
law requires nursing homes to maintain staff at a rate of 3.2
nursing hours per patient per day, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Lavender v. Skilled Healthcare Group, DR060264,
Superior Court, Humboldt County, California (Eureka). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gulf Drilling Ban Should Be Restored, U.S. Argues &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A three-judge appeals panel will hear arguments from the
U.S. government today on whether a six-month moratorium on deep-
water drilling in the Gulf of Mexico should be reinstated after
a lower court judge threw out the ban. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government is seeking to delay an order by U.S.
District Judge Martin Feldman that scrapped the six-month
drilling moratorium, imposed May 27 after the explosion and
sinking of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feldman&#8217;s June 22 ruling came in a lawsuit against U.S.
regulators by oil service companies claiming the drilling
suspension would cause them irreparable economic harm. The ban&#8217;s
potential economic impact is outweighed by the risk of another
spill, lawyers for the Interior Department argued in court
papers filed before a hearing set for this afternoon in New
Orleans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If in Interior&#8217;s judgment, drilling poses a threat of
serious or irreparable environmental harm, the public interest
in avoiding that threat would trump economic considerations in
the short term,&#8221; the government said in a July 6 filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Interior Department asked the appeals court to stay
Feldman&#8217;s order and keep the moratorium in place long enough for
regulators to appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hornbeck Offshore Services Inc. and more than a dozen other
offshore service and supply companies sued U.S. regulators,
including Interior Secretary Kenneth Salazar, last month,
seeking to block the moratorium. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Hornbeck Offshore Services LLC v. Salazar,
2:10-cv-01663, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Louisiana (New Orleans). The appeal case is 10-30585, 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals (New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC Sued for Fraud Over Credit-Card Protection Plan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Units of HSBC Holdings Plc, Europe&#8217;s biggest lender by
market value, were sued by U.S. customers who said the bank&#8217;s
credit-card payment-protection service defrauds disabled,
retired and unemployed consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the service purports to safeguard accounts by
suspending or canceling required minimum payments when customers
become disabled or unemployed, the circumstances that trigger
protection are &#8220;varied, complicated and always changing,&#8221;
according to complaints filed July 2 against HSBC units in
federal courts in Philadelphia and Camden, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank enrolls people before sending them restrictions in
small print that are &#8220;incomplete, indecipherable, misleading
and obfuscatory,&#8221; the complaints said. The plan, which costs
$1.35 per $100 of a month-ending credit-card balance, excludes
the self-employed, part-time workers, retired people and those
who are already unemployed or on disability, the customers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kate Durham, a spokeswoman for London-based HSBC, said the
bank doesn&#8217;t comment on legal matters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The payment protection device is designed to prey on the
financially insecure and is virtually worthless because of the
numerous restrictions that are imposed,&#8221; according to the
complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Camden complaint, brought by Marilyn Rizera, said HSBC
Bank USA Inc. and HSBC Card Services Inc. are violating the New
Jersey Consumer Fraud Act and engaged in breach of contract. The
Philadelphia case, by Edward T. Esslinger, Gloria Glover and
Adrath Rogers, said the bank is violating the Pennsylvania
Unfair Practices and Consumer Protection Law.Both seek to
proceed as group, or class-action, lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Payment Protection is so confusing as to when coverage is
triggered, so restricted in terms of the benefits it provides to
subscribers, and processing claims is made so difficult by HSBC,
that the product is essentially worthless,&#8221; according to
Rizera&#8217;s complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Rizera v. HSBC Bank USA Inc., 10-cv-3375,
U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey (Camden); and
Esslinger v. HSBC Bank Services, 10-cv-3213, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlyle Group Sued by Mortgage Bond Fund Liquidator over Losses &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlyle Group, the world&#8217;s second-largest private-equity
firm, was sued by liquidators of the buyout firm&#8217;s defunct
mortgage bond fund, saying executives lost $945 million in
overly risky investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquidators for Carlyle Capital Corp. Ltd, a Guernsey,
Channel Islands-based hedge fund that collapsed in March 2008,
contend Carlyle directors turned a blind eye to questionable
investments in residential mortgage-backed securities and failed
to stop the loss of all the company&#8217;s capital, according to a
lawsuit filed in Delaware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the short space of eight months, the entirety of CCC&#8217;s
capital was spectacularly lost under the reckless and grossly
negligent direction, supervision, management and advice of the
defendants,&#8221; the liquidators said in the suit, filed yesterday
in Delaware Chancery Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders seized Carlyle Capital&#8217;s assets after it failed to
meet more than $400 million of margin calls on mortgage-backed
collateral that had plunged in value. Carlyle Group, co-founded
by David Rubenstein, wound up the fund seven months after its
initial public offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlyle Group officials said they&#8217;d defend themselves in
court over the fund liquidators&#8217; claims. The liquidators also
filed suit over the investment losses in state court in
Manhattan yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will vigorously contest all claims and are confident
we will prevail,&#8221; Chris Ullman, a company spokesman, said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlyle Capital raised $945 million in equity funding and
sought to generate annual returns of at least 12 percent by
investing in residential mortgage backed securities and
&#8220;leveraged finance assets,&#8221; the liquidators&#8217; lawyers said in
the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s business model called for leverage equaling
19 times capital, the complaint said, adding that the actual
leverage employed exceeded 30 times capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mortgage securities were among the biggest contributors to
writedowns and credit losses of almost $1.8 trillion since the
start of 2007 at the world&#8217;s largest banks, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Carlyle Capital Corp. Ltd. v. William Elias
Conway Jr., CA5625, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firearms Sellers, CME Trader Sue Chicago Over Gun-Control Law &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Chicago Mercantile Exchange trader and three other people
have joined with the Illinois Association of Firearms Retailers
to sue the city of Chicago over a restrictive gun law passed by
its legislators last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gun-owning plaintiffs, who include a teacher&#8217;s aide and
a married couple, claim the new ordinance restricting handgun
possession to inside the home and mandating firearms training
and permitting is unconstitutional. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measure imposes &#8220;new restrictions that have the
purpose and effect of preventing plaintiffs and other law-
abiding residents of Chicago from exercising their fundamental
right to keep and carry firearms for self defense and other
lawful purposes,&#8221; the plaintiffs said in a complaint filed July
6 in the city&#8217;s federal courthouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruling in a case challenging Chicago&#8217;s earlier ban on
handgun possession, a divided U.S. Supreme Court on June 28 said
the constitutional right to bear arms binds states and
municipalities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chicago&#8217;s new law was passed by the city council 45-0 four
days later. Jennifer Hoyle, a spokeswoman for the city&#8217;s law
department, said in an e-mailed message that the office had just
received a copy of the complaint and is reviewing it. She said
she couldn&#8217;t otherwise immediately comment. The high court
decision &#8220;effectively overturned&#8221; the city&#8217;s handgun ban,
Mayor Richard M. Daley said in a July 2 press statement
announcing the new ordinance. He is a named defendant in the
lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The retailer&#8217;s association, based in Carbondale, Illinois,
claims it has members who want to sell guns and operate firing
ranges within the city, yet can&#8217;t because of the law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs seek a court order declaring the
restrictions unconstitutional. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Benson v. City of Chicago, 10cv4184, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The head of the Argentine agency
dedicated to fighting money laundering asked prosecutors to
investigate JPMorgan Chase  Co., Grupo Clarin SA, Banco
Patagonia SA and Consultatio SA, saying they manipulated the
price of stocks at public offerings, the country&#8217;s state-run
news agency Telam reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jose Sbatella, head of Argentina&#8217;s Financial Information
Unit, filed the request for the probe, Telam said, citing a
statement from the agency. A copy of the UIF&#8217;s statement
couldn&#8217;t be found on its website after normal business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The request is based on testimony from former JPMorgan
employee Hernan Arbizu, Telam said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arbizu, an Argentine, fled the U.S. in 2008 after being
indicted for embezzlement. He has been sued by the bank for
allegedly stealing money from a client account and taking
confidential information about customers. Arbizu said in an
interview in Buenos Aires last year that the charges against him
are true and that he didn&#8217;t profit from the transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The complaint has no grounds,&#8221; Clarin said by e-mail.
&#8220;The offerings were made in London and Buenos Aires according
to all international norms.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony declined to comment to
Bloomberg. A call to the mobile phone of Argentina government
spokesman Alfredo Scoccimarro wasn&#8217;t answered. Nobody was
immediately available to comment at the other companies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the millions he made peddling
fake Viagra, Martin Hickman bought a beachside villa on Spain&#8217;s
Costa del Sol, a diamond-studded Rolex and a flat in London.
Pfizer Inc. aims to make sure he never gets to enjoy them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spoils of Hickman&#8217;s crimes helped settle a trademark
infringement lawsuit brought by the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker
three years ago. It&#8217;s the biggest example of a new approach
Pfizer is taking to fight counterfeiting of prescription drugs,
an industry that&#8217;s almost doubled to $75 billion in five years,
according to the New York-based Center for Medicine in the
Public Interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, whose erectile dysfunction pill Viagra is one of
the most copied medicines, once relied on local authorities and
criminal courts to hunt down offenders. Now it&#8217;s hired former
U.S. customs officials, FBI agents, Turkish narcotics experts
and Hong Kong police to find counterfeiters. In China, they&#8217;re
tracking fakes to the source, raiding derelict warehouses for
evidence of illegal drug-making. In the U.K., they&#8217;re using
civil courts to hit fake pill peddlers where it hurts most. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The point is to make them realize that there&#8217;s no sense
from a business perspective in counterfeiting our products,
because if we find you, we&#8217;re taking your money away,&#8221; says
John P. Clark, a 55-year-old U.S. law enforcement veteran who
now serves as New York-based Pfizer&#8217;s chief security officer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. and OAO Rosneft&#8217;s plan
to drill for oil in the Russian Black Sea hinge on a request for
government tax breaks, according to a copy of their initial
drilling agreement obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final agreement is conditional on the group gaining
assurances of &#8220;fiscal relief&#8221; from the Russian government &#8220;to
ensure the economic viability of the project,&#8221; according to the
document. The two sides aim to finish negotiations by the end of
March and start drilling at the end of next year. Chevron will
have a 33.3 percent stake in the venture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia needs foreign capital and technology to tap harder-
to-drill deposits as production from existing fields in Siberia
declines. The deal would mark Chevron&#8217;s second attempt at
Russian offshore drilling after the state annulled a production
sharing agreement to develop a block of the coast of Sakhalin
Island in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Russia is looking for foreign direct investment in
frontier areas where Russians do not have the expertise to
explore and develop themselves,&#8221; Ed Chow, a senior fellow at
the Center for Strategic International Studies and a former
Chevron executive, said by e-mail. &#8220;There are oil companies
willing to test the investment climate in spite of Russia&#8217;s
dubious track record.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tax Exemptions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state last year approved exemptions from mineral
extraction tax for the first 20 million metric tons of oil
produced from Black Sea deposits. Even so, Chevron Chief
Executive John Watson said the venture would seek tax breaks for
the project in a meeting with Prime Minister Vladimir Putin
during the signing of the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ideally, fiscal relief should come from a change in the
tax laws applying to new exploration and production projects,&#8221;
Alexei Kokin, an oil and gas analyst at AFK Metropol, said by e-
mail today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A deal would also mark Chevron&#8217;s initial foray into the
little-explored Black Sea after rival Exxon Mobil Corp. has
snapped up acreage in Turkey and Romania as have Petroleo
Brasileiro SA, OAO Lukoil and Vanco Energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron will provide all financing, up to $1 billion, in
the venture&#8217;s exploration phase which would include drilling two
exploration wells and two appraisal wells on one discovery, the
document said, adding that Chevron will pay a Rosneft bonus in
the event of a discovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venture Structure &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group will seek to structure the venture to allow
Chevron to book reserves, according to U.S. Securities Exchange
Commission requirements even though Rosneft will retain complete
ownership of the licenses to the venture&#8217;s West Chernomorsky
block, the agreement said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosneft has identified 5 potential structures in the
deepwater block and potential resources of 860 million tons of
oil, according to the company website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drilling on the block is expected to begin at the end of
next year, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin said last
month at the time of the signing. The two companies will first
have to find a way to close negotiations which have been going
on since at least 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Rosneft and Chevron declined to comment on ongoing
commercial negotiations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia&#8217;s dollar may rise versus
its Canadian counterpart as Chinese growth benefits the South
Pacific nation while the North American country is more at risk
to a U.S. slowdown, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy Australia&#8217;s dollar, targeting gains to
95 Canadian cents, and exit the trade if it closes below 88.5
Canadian cents, Goldman analysts including London-based Fiona
Lake wrote in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Australian dollar surged today as the nation added
three times as many workers in June as economists had estimated,
boosting prospects the Reserve Bank of Australia will resume
raising interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Today&#8217;s strong labor market data has reversed the cuts
previously priced by the market,&#8221; the analysts wrote. Goldman
expects Australia will raise its key rate, now at 4.5 percent,
by 25 basis points in 2010, with "75 basis points more
tightening in 2011.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia&#8217;s employment rolls rose by 45,900 in June, a
statistics bureau report showed today. The median estimate of 22
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for an increase of
15,000. The jobless rate held at 5.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Australian dollar advanced to 91.30 Canadian cents as
of 3:48 p.m. in Sydney, from 90.47 cents yesterday in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think the downside risks may not be adequately
reflected in the Canadian dollar yet, especially given Canada&#8217;s
close trade links to the U.S.,&#8221; according to the note. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was accused
in a lawsuit by Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. of misleading
investors in 2007 when it sold Fannie Mae preferred shares while
betting against the U.S. mortgage market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs misrepresented Fannie Mae&#8217;s health when it
underwrote the offerings, in which the insurer invested
$62.5 million, according to a complaint filed yesterday in
federal court in Boston. The investment bank misstated the
purpose of the sale by saying the offering was to raise surplus
capital when it was actually needed to help Fannie Mae sustain
its business, said Liberty Mutual, which accused Goldman Sachs
of securities fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As a knowledgeable and sophisticated investor in the U.S.
real estate financial markets, and with access to Fannie Mae&#8217;s
financial records, Goldman Sachs knew or recklessly disregarded
the actual status of Fannie Mae&#8217;s capital structure,&#8221; Liberty
Mutual said in the complaint. The mortgage guarantor was seized
by the U.S. in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, said the suit was without merit &#8220;and we will contest it
vigorously.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has come under fire from Congress and
regulators for its underwriting and investments as mortgage
markets collapsed during the credit crisis. The U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission sued Goldman Sachs in April, claiming it
sold a collateralized debt obligation without disclosing that a
hedge fund helped pick underlying securities and bet against the
vehicles. Goldman Sachs has denied wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senate Probe &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time that it was underwriting the Fannie Mae
offering, Goldman was aware that there were &#8220;significant
problems&#8221; in the real estate market and bet its own money
against subprime-mortgage-related securities, Liberty Mutual
said in the complaint, which drew on documents collected by the
U.S. Senate&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documents, including internal Goldman Sachs e-mails,
establish that during the time leading up to the disputed
offerings, &#8220;Goldman Sachs not only knew about the serious risks
in the mortgage market, but it was urgently moving to short the
mortgage market,&#8221; the suit says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managing Risk &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offerings raised almost $8 billion and were completed
in September and December of 2007, according to the complaint.
Fannie Mae fell into U.S. conservatorship the following
September, leaving Liberty&#8217;s investment &#8220;virtually worthless,&#8221;
the suit says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein
told the Senate panel in April that his firm is a market-maker,
a role that often puts the company on the opposite side of
customers as it tries to manage its own risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We didn&#8217;t have a massive short against the housing market
and we certainly did not bet against our clients,&#8221; Blankfein
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich Angevine, a spokesman for Liberty Mutual, declined to
comment. The Boston-based company is owned by policyholders and
isn&#8217;t publicly traded. Goldman Sachs advanced $2.26, or
1.7 percent, to $137.72 at 12:05 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. The stock has dropped 18 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liberty Mutual slashed its stake in Goldman Sachs by
80 percent in the six months ended March 31, 2009. That was part
of more than two years of stock sales that brought the insurer&#8217;s
stake in Goldman Sachs to 7,752 shares at the end of the first
quarter from 46,343 shares in September 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liberty Mutual dumped bank stocks after the 2008 financial
crisis, Chief Executive Officer Edmund &#8220;Ted&#8221; Kelly said in a
March 2009 conference call with policyholders and bond
investors. Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo
 Co. were among the financial firms sold in late 2008,
according to regulatory filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Liberty Mutual v. Goldman Sachs, 10-cv-11150,
U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts (Boston). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.K. government staff suggested
replacing Microsoft Corp. operating systems on computers with
free alternatives in response to a call for ideas for Prime
Minister David Cameron&#8217;s cost-cutting drive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameron asked the 600,000 government workers last month to
make suggestions on saving money as his administration seeks to
cut Britain&#8217;s record budget deficit. Chancellor of the Exchequer
George Osborne today published a sample of the 56,000 submitted
ideas, which including abandoning Microsoft, switching office
lights off and centralizing stationery procurement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In terms of spending less, what about migrating the whole
of government (the NHS, education etc.) from Microsoft products
to Linux and open-source software like Openoffice,&#8221; read one of
the suggestions displayed on the Treasury website. Two of the 31
listed proposals, whose authors were not named, suggested
dropping Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open-source software such as Linux and Openoffice offers
free or very cheap alternatives to Microsoft&#8217;s Windows and
Office, the world&#8217;s most popular operating system and
productivity software. Osborne said before the Conservatives won
power in the May 6 election that he favored the idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We need to follow the example of businesses all over the
world and take advantage of open-source technology,&#8221; Osborne
wrote in The Times of London in February 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Osborne said today he is now asking the public to send in
ideas about how the government should save money to narrow the
155-billion-pound ($235 billion) budget shortfall. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zinc will be 12 percent less than previously estimated at

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. hired former
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. managing director Yozo Tachibana to
head fixed income, currencies and commodities sales in Japan,
according to an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tachibana, 39, joined Bank of America as a managing
director yesterday to help win new clients in Japan and deliver
Japanese products to its global customers, according to the memo.
Tsukasa Noda, a Tokyo-based spokesman at the Charlotte, North
Carolina-based bank&#8217;s Merrill Lynch Japan Securities Co. unit,
confirmed the contents of the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tachibana previously was managing director of Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s merchant banking division in Japan. He was also the head
of the New York-based company&#8217;s institutional, international,
yen flow, and yen non-flow sales group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banker is at least the fifth person to be hired by Bank
of America in the country from a rival. The company in April
recruited Tomomi Kikuchi from JPMorgan Chase  Co. to head sales
of mortgage-backed securities in Japan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. declined to
comment on reports the company has received government approval
to explore a bid for BP Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s Alan Jeffers had no comment on the report today in
the London-based Times newspaper. Max McGahan, a spokesman for
London-based BP, also said he wouldn&#8217;t comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP is seeking funds to pay for the biggest U.S. oil spill
in history. The company is in talks to sell some assets
including its Alaska oil fields to Houston-based Apache Corp.,
two people familiar with the discussions said. The talks were
first reported in the same story as the Exxon news in the Times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Times reported that Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, has
been told by the U.S. government it can look at a potential bid
for BP. The newspaper cited oil-industry sources for the
information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP scrapped its dividend and said last month it will sell
some of its assets to pay cleanup costs, fines and legal damages
from the biggest offshore oil spill in U.S. history. The company
has spent more than $3 billion on spill response in the Gulf of
Mexico and agreed to establish a $20 billion fund for damage
claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon would evaluate any asset sales by BP, Chief Executive
Officer Rex Tillerson said on July 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cecelia Prewett, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission, said she&#8217;s not aware of the agency giving Exxon the
permission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We would need to do a review,&#8221; she said in an e-mailed

&lt;p&gt;The MSCI China Index may rebound in
the near term because concern that the economy will slow is
already priced into the shares after annual declines and as
liquidity improves, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decline in agricultural prices may give authorities more
leeway to adjust monetary policy, while central bank cash
injections and a release of locked-up funds from Agricultural
Bank of China Ltd.&#8217;s initial public offering will boost
available funds, according to JPMorgan strategists led by Frank Li in a report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe that the market may have discounted some of
the economic slowdown risks,&#8221; Li, who is top-ranked for
strategy in Institutional Investor&#8217;s inaugural All-China
research poll, said in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI China Index, which measures mostly Hong Kong-
traded Chinese companies, has declined 5.5 percent this year, as
the government sought to restrain inflation and record property
price gains. The measure dropped 0.4 percent to 61.10 at 10:08
a.m. and trades at 15.7 times reported earnings, compared with
last year&#8217;s high of about 22.6 times in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, JPMorgan remains &#8220;cautious&#8221; on the MSCI China
because of the risk to earnings from an economic slowdown,
policies including the new resource tax and price caps for coal
companies, and as banks continue to raise funds, Li wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should favor consumer stocks, expressways,
independent power producers, banks and insurers, and avoid
commodities, property developers, paper manufacturers and
airlines, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank IPO &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agricultural Bank of China Ltd., which begins trading in
Shanghai on July 15 and in Hong Kong the day after, raised $19.2
billion in the world&#8217;s biggest initial public offering in four
years. The release of money tied up in the share sale may be a
possible near-term catalyst for the stock market, Li said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank injected as much as 517 billion yuan
($76.3 billion) in liquidity through open-market operations in
June, compared with 224 billion yuan in May, and net withdrawals
in April and March, according to the JPMorgan report. July net
liquidity injection is likely to stay at around 500 billion yuan,
the brokerage estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Authorities seem to have become more accommodative in
improving the domestic liquidity situation, which marks a far
cry from the government&#8217;s earlier practice of aggressively
taking liquidity out of the system,&#8221; Li said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup
Inc., Morgan Stanley and dozens more bank and brokerages were
sued by a Boston area-based fund seeking reimbursement for
losses related to subprime loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cambridge Place Investment Management Inc., founded by ex-
Goldman Sachs Group bankers Martin Finegold and Robert Kramer,
lost more than $1.2 billion as a result of the banks&#8217; untrue
statements, according to a copy of the complaint filed July 9 in
state court in Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks sold securities backed by mortgages that came
from a &#8220;small group of now notorious subprime mortgage
originators,&#8221; used faulty appraisals, accepted misleading
information in loan applications, and violated their own
standards for underwriting, the firm said in the lawsuit. The
banks offered or sold $2.4 billion of residential mortgage-
backed securities using untrue statements, according to the
lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Wall Street banks conducted inadequate due diligence
and failed to satisfy their own responsibilities,&#8221; Cambridge
Place said in the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bundling of the riskiest type of mortgages into
securities played a role in turning the U.S. housing slump into
a global recession as foreclosures deflated bond values and
toppled Wall Street firms including Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Improper Lending&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks created an &#8220;environment of improper lending
practices,&#8221; keeping personnel on site at the mortgage lenders
to monitor the loan underwriting business, according to the
lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit also names Bank of America Corp., Merrill Lynch 
Co., UBS AG, JPMorgan Chase  Co., Barclays PLC, Credit Suisse
Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings PLC and dozens of
others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives from Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan,
Barclays, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank
declined to comment on the lawsuit. Representatives from the
others couldn&#8217;t be reached after business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank representatives who allegedly offered or sold
securities to Cambridge Place included Scott Eichel, RBS
Securities Inc.&#8217;s co-head of its mortgage and asset backed
securities business, when he had been at Bear Stearns Cos., and
Greg Lippman, who helped create the market for betting against
subprime mortgage bonds in 2005 and then profited along with
hedge funds when home prices declined and defaults soared to
records two years later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eichel, Lippman &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eichel didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment after regular business hours. A voice message left for
Lippman after business hours wasn&#8217;t returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The filing wasn&#8217;t immediately available on the court&#8217;s
electronic docket and was provided by an attorney for Concord,
Massachusetts-based Cambridge Place Investment Management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case, according to the court records, is Cambridge
Place Investment Management Inc. v. Morgan Stanley, 10-2741,
Massachusetts Superior Court, Suffolk County (Boston). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks rose, adding to gains
from the biggest weekly rally in a year for the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 Index, as analyst upgrades of technology companies
boosted optimism before the start of the earnings season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SanDisk Corp. surged 6.8 percent as UBS AG advised buying
the shares, while Qualcomm Inc. jumped 3.5 percent as Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. added the stock to its &#8220;conviction buy&#8221; list.
Hewitt Associates Inc. surged 32 percent after Aon Corp. agreed
to buy the consulting company. Alcoa Inc. lost 0.6 percent
before starting the second-quarter earnings season by reporting
results after exchanges closed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 rose 0.1 percent to 1,078.75 as of 4 p.m. in
New York. The benchmark for U.S. stocks rallied 5.4 percent last
week, its biggest gain since July 2009. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average increased 18.24 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,216.27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People think the technology sector is the best place to
find companies that will surprise during earnings season,&#8221; said
Frank Ingarra, a Stamford, Connecticut-based money manager at
Hennessy Advisors Inc., which oversees about $800 million. &#8220;If
companies are not hiring people because of economic and
political uncertainty, then they will invest in technology to
become more productive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profits for SP 500 companies are projected to have
increased 34 percent in the April-June period and by the same
amount in 2010, according to analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 23 companies in the SP 500, including Google
Inc. and Citigroup Inc., will report earnings this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP 500 Rebound &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 rebounded last week from a 10-month low as the
International Monetary Fund raised its growth forecast and
investors speculated a 16 percent selloff since April was
overdone given the outlook for earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are in a neutral trading environment as we are waiting
for earnings season to start,&#8221; said James W. Gaul, a money
manager at Boston Advisors LLC in Boston, which oversees about
$1.9 billion. &#8220;We had a massive rally last week and now we&#8217;re
waiting for the next piece of meaningful news. We will be
looking for a combination of earnings growth and forward-looking
comments.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcoa unofficially started the reporting season today when
it reported second-quarter earnings after the close of trading
in New York. Profit from continuing operations was 13 cents a
share, beating the average estimate of analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg by 14 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcoa &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock fell 0.6 percent to $10.87 at the close. In
extended trading after the close, it rallied 3 percent to
$11.20. Materials producers declined the most of 10 industry
groups in the SP 500 in regular trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hewitt rallied 32 percent to $46.79. Aon, the world&#8217;s
largest insurance broker, agreed to buy Hewitt for $4.9 billion
in cash and stock to expand its division advising companies on
employee pay and benefits. Aon dropped 7.1 percent to $35.62 for
the biggest decline in the SP 500. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmark index for U.S. stock options retreated for a
seventh day, the longest losing streak since March, and closed
at the lowest level in a month. The VIX, as the Chicago Board
Options Exchange Volatility Index is known, fell 2.2 percent to
24.43. The SP 500 traded in a 0.96 percentage point range
between today&#8217;s intraday high and low, 43 percent below the 1.7
percentage point average daily swing for the past four weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SanDisk surged 6.8 percent to $45.81. The flash-data
storage company was raised to &#8220;buy&#8221; from &#8220;neutral&#8221; at UBS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qualcomm &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qualcomm rose 3.5 percent to $35.10 as Goldman Sachs added
the largest phone-chip producer to its &#8220;conviction buy&#8221; list,
citing accelerating smartphone growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer and software shares have slumped to the lowest
valuations in two decades, a sign to Barclays Wealth and UBS AG
they will rebound as SP 500 companies start spending their
record cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology companies in the SP 500 fell as much as 17
percent this year, pushing prices down to 15.6 times reported
annual income, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
biggest industry in the index hasn&#8217;t been this cheap since at
least 1992, excluding the six months between Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.&#8217;s bankruptcy and the start of the bull market in
March 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tech Rally &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP 500 technology companies gained 0.7 percent as a group
in today&#8217;s trading, the most among the 10 major industries in
the SP 500. Indexes of utility and consumer-staples companies
had the second- and third-biggest gains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. rose the most in the Dow, advancing 2.3
percent to $24.83. The world&#8217;s biggest software maker will work
with Hewlett-Packard Co., Dell Inc. and Fujitsu Ltd. to sell
powerful server computers installed with Microsoft&#8217;s Azure
cloud-computing software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc&#8217;s U.S. shares gained 8 percent to $36.76. The
company battling to contain the biggest oil spill in U.S.
history in the Gulf of Mexico rose on reports it is selling
assets in Alaska and Exxon Mobil Corp. may consider a bid for
the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playboy Enterprises Inc. surged 41 percent to $5.55. The
publisher of the namesake men&#8217;s magazine said founder Hugh Hefner proposed taking the company private by buying the
outstanding shares he doesn&#8217;t already own for $5.50 a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart Stores Inc. climbed 1.4 percent to $50.12. The
world&#8217;s biggest retailer may rise as much as 33 percent as it
boosts sales by expanding its online business and opens stores
in urban centers, Barron&#8217;s reported, citing analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mosaic Co. plunged 7.9 percent to $42.48. The world&#8217;s
largest manufacturer of phosphate fertilizer told workers at its
South Fort Meade, Florida, phosphate mine that the facility may
be closed indefinitely because of a legal challenge by
environmental groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weyerhaeuser Co. advanced the most in the SP 500, surging
8.4 percent to $38.86. The second-largest owner of U.S.
timberland declared a record $5.6 billion special dividend to
lock in the company&#8217;s conversion this year to a real estate
investment trust. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. Chief Executive
Officer Steve Ballmer said partners are working on Windows-based
tablet computers, reaffirming the software maker&#8217;s commitment to
the form factor popularized by Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and computer-maker partners have been selling

&lt;p&gt;Argentina&#8217;s economy will expand 8
percent in 2010, up from a previous forecast of 5.3 percent
because of &#8220;lax&#8221; fiscal and monetary policies, a record
harvest and higher commodities prices, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
economist Alberto Ramos said in an e-mailed report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth will slow to 5.8 percent next year and the economy
will face a &#8220;risk of a hard landing&#8221; in 2012, Ramos said.
Inflation will be 25 percent this year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The current growth cycle is beset with fundamental flaws
-- significant acceleration in inflation, erosion of the current
account balance and record-high levels of primary spending --
that could be a source of medium term vulnerability,&#8221; Ramos
wrote in the report. &#8220;The over-stimulation of the economy is
probably not independent of the political cycle, with the
presidential elections in late 2011.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economy, South America&#8217;s second largest after Brazil,
is recovering from a slump that reduced growth to 0.9 percent
last year, the slowest since Argentina pulled out of a recession
in 2003. President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner announced in
May an 8 billion-peso ($2.03 billion) loan program for companies
to help them boost production and exports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross domestic product grew 6.8 percent in the first
quarter from a year earlier and 3 percent from the last three
months of 2009, the National Statistics Institute said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given the peculiarities of the current growth cycle and
the authorities&#8217; neglect of monetary variables, inflation is
likely to reach 25 percent this year and to remain high next
year,&#8221; Ramos wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflation and the deterioration of the current account will
likely push the government to allow a drop of the peso to more
than 4 pesos per dollar by year end, Ramos said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In trading today, the peso was little changed at 3.9368 per
dollar at 1:56 p.m. New York time from 3.9355 on July 8. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BP Plc jumped the most in 20 months
in London trading on speculation the company may succeed in
halting the biggest oil spill in U.S. history this week as it
negotiates the sale of assets in Alaska. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP climbed 9.4 percent, the most since November 2008, to
close at 398.95 pence in London. That&#8217;s 31 percent higher than
the low reached June 25. The shares are still down 39 percent
since the April 20 accident in the Gulf of Mexico that triggered
the leak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The producer said it may be able to cut off the flow of oil
from the damaged well this week, beginning with a pressure test
today. Separately, BP is in talks to sell assets to Apache Corp.
for a price of less than $12 billion, people familiar with the
matter said yesterday. That deal alone would put BP ahead of its
target of $10 billion in asset sales to help cover spill costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s limited material downside after the well is
capped,&#8221; said Jason Kenney, an analyst at ING Wholesale Banking
in Edinburgh. &#8220;You can put Alaska in a pot beside Argentina,
Colombia, Venezuela and Vietnam assets that are being looked
at.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the well passes the 48-hour test, BP may shut it, Doug Suttles, BP&#8217;s chief operating officer for exploration and
production, told reporters. The relief wells BP is drilling will
still be needed to permanently plug it, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spill Costs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP scrapped its dividend and said last month it will sell
some assets to raise $10 billion for cleanup costs, fines and
legal damages from the Gulf spill. The company said today it has
spent $3.5 billion on the spill. It agreed to establish a $20
billion fund for damage claims with President Barack Obama last
month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drop in BP shares has prompted speculation that it may
be taken over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp., based in Irving, Texas, has been told by
the U.S. government it can look at a potential bid for BP, the
London-based Sunday Times reported, citing unidentified people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If Exxon shows its hand, there would be others queuing up
behind it,&#8221; ING&#8217;s Kenney said. &#8220;BP screams out as being cheap
at the minute because the value of its assets is about $90
billion more than the current enterprise value.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unlikely that Exxon will actually bid for BP, Kenney
said. Robert Dye, a spokesman for Apache, and Max McGahan, a BP
spokesman, declined to comment on the asset sales. Exxon
declined to comment on its reported interest in BP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP fell 13 percent on June 1 after an attempt to plug the
leak by injecting mud and debris from the top of well failed.
Relief wells, which will intersect the damaged Macondo well near
the bottom to stop the flow of oil and gas, are running ahead of
schedule and may be completed this month, National Incident
Commander Thad Allen said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of insuring BP debt against default fell for the
ninth straight day, dropping 35.5 basis points to 335.5,
according to CMA DataVision, the lowest since June 8. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.K. stocks rallied for a fifth day,
the longest stretch of gains in a month, led by BP Plc on
speculation the energy company may succeed in halting the
biggest oil spill in U.S. history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP surged the most in 19 months amid optimism Apache Corp.
may buy about $12 billion worth of the oil producer&#8217;s assets.
Cobham Plc climbed as BofA-Merrill Lynch Global Research
recommended the manufacturer. Kazakhmys Plc led mining shares
lower, as copper retreated from a two-week high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmark FTSE 100 climbed 34.08, or 0.7 percent, to
5,167.02 in London, extending last week&#8217;s 6.1 percent rally,
which was the biggest in a year. The FTSE All-Share Index rose
0.6 percent while Ireland&#8217;s ISEQ Index gained 0.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;BP is providing a lot of momentum,&#8221; said London-based
David Jones, chief market strategist at IG Index. &#8220;The newsflow
continues to be much more positive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP climbed 9.4 percent to 398.95 pence, extending last
week&#8217;s 13 percent surge. The energy company said it may be able
to cut off the flow of oil from the damaged Gulf of Mexico oil
well this week, beginning with a pressure test today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, people familiar with the discussions said BP is

BP&#8217;s Alaska business, for a price of less than $12 billion. BP
last month said it will sell some of its assets to raise $10
billion for cleanup costs, fines and legal damages from the Gulf
spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken Over &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP&#8217;s shares have plunged 39 percent since the April 20
accident that triggered the oil leak, prompting speculation the
company may be taken over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sunday Times reported Exxon Mobil Corp., based in
Irving, Texas, has been told by the U.S. government it can look
at a potential bid for BP. The newspaper cited unidentified
people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cobham rallied 2.5 percent to 234.2 pence. BofA-Merrill
Lynch upgraded the world&#8217;s largest maker of airborne-refueling
equipment to &#8220;buy&#8221; from &#8220;neutral&#8221; as analysts forecast an
increase in defense spending for electronics, systems,
communications and technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kazakhmys, Kazakhstan&#8217;s biggest copper mining company,
declined 2.9 percent to 1,057 pence as gauge of mining shares
snapped a four-day rally. Rio Tinto Group slid 2.2 percent to
3,102.5 pence and BHP Billiton Ltd. fell 1.5 percent to 1,825
pence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper fell in London after imports by China, the world&#8217;s
largest metals consumer, declined in June, signaling that demand
growth may be weakening. Zinc, nickel and lead also retreated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kier Group Plc jumped 3.4 percent to 975 pence after the
U.K. company that helped build the Channel Tunnel said full-year
pretax profit will be toward the &#8220;upper end&#8221; of the current
range of analyst estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashmore Group Plc surged 6.4 percent to 268.4 pence as HSBC
Holdings Plc raised its recommendation for the fund manager to
&#8220;overweight&#8221; from &#8220;neutral.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UBS AG hired JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s
Mark Zanoli as head of technology investment banking for the
Americas as part of the Swiss bank&#8217;s plan to target more deals
in the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zanoli, 44, will be based in San Francisco and will start
on Oct. 1 reporting to Aryeh Bourkoff, joint global head of
technology, media and telecommunications banking, according to
an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This important hire demonstrates our commitment to a
growing franchise within our TMT practice and complements our
existing team,&#8221; Bourkoff, 37, said in a phone interview. &#8220;TMT
is one of our growth areas and I expect to continue to make
targeted hires in the sector in the coming years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zanoli joins Zurich-based UBS after Richard Leaman, the
chairman and former head of UBS&#8217;s investment banking department,
left last week to join Moelis  Co., the New York-based
investment bank founded by former UBS executive Kenneth Moelis.
Zanoli replaces Brian Webber, who joined Moelis in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Over the course of the next 12 to 18 months, we expect to
see steady growth in technology deals led by initial public
offerings and acquisitions,&#8221; said Bourkoff. &#8220;We believe in the
integration of technology within TMT given there are many
companies that sit on the bridge between media and technologies
such as Hulu LLC, Google Inc., Cisco Systems Inc., Tivo Inc.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zanoli, who brings 17 years of experience in banking, joins
from JPMorgan, where he was a managing director and served in
senior roles, including head of technology banking, head of
communications technology banking and, most recently, in clean
technology banking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BSkyB, Bresnan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS&#8217;s Americas technology team has bankers in San
Francisco, Los Angeles and New York. The Swiss firm is beefing
up its TMT team, which is advising British Sky Broadcasting
Group PLC on the $11.5 billion offer by News Corp. to acquire
the 61 percent stake in of BSkyB that it doesn&#8217;t already own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS advised Bresnan Communications Co. on its sale to
Cablevision Systems Corp. for about $1.4 billion last month.
Last year, UBS advised Comcast Corp. on its $37.5 billion joint
venture with General Electric Co.&#8217; NBC Universal media unit and
Charter Communications Inc. on its $21 billion bankruptcy
restructuring. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy BB and B rated
U.S. corporate bonds amid lower inflation and interest rates and
slowing economic growth, JPMorgan Chase  Co. analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default rate for high-yield, high-risk securities will
be 2 percent through the end of 2011, analysts led by Peter Acciavatti wrote July 9 in a research report. The U.S. economy
will grow 3.1 percent this year and 3 percent in 2011, JPMorgan
predicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Positive growth but growth not powerful enough to produce
inflation and higher interest rates is a Goldilocks scenario for
high-yield,&#8221; the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-yield, or junk, debt is rated below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service and lower than BBB- by Standard  Poor&#8217;s. In
SP&#8217;s ratings system, the first six levels below investment
grade range from BB+ to B-. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to own junk bonds instead
of Treasuries will tighten to 525 basis points by the end of the
year, the analysts wrote. Spreads narrowed 10 basis points on
July 9 to 688 basis points, the third straight decline and the
biggest drop since June 21, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spreads imply a default rate of 5.9 percent, nearly triple
what the analysts forecast. Acciavatti couldn&#8217;t be reached for
comment on the report because he was traveling. &lt;/p&gt;

Central America and the Caribbean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martinez, who will be based in Orlando, Florida, will be

&lt;p&gt;Martinez, 63, gave up his Florida Senate seat in August,

&lt;p&gt;BP Plc, battling to contain the
biggest oil spill in U.S. history in the Gulf of Mexico, rose on
reports it is selling assets in Alaska and Exxon Mobil Corp. may
consider a bid for the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP climbed as much as 7.2 percent, the most in a month, and
traded at 390 pence as of 1:26 p.m. in London. That&#8217;s 28 percent
higher than the low reached June 25. The shares are down 40
percent since the April 20 accident that started the oil leak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP is in talks to sell assets to Apache Corp. for a price

&lt;p&gt;Obama Agreement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP may stop the flow of crude from the leaking Gulf of
Mexico well after a pressure test today, National Incident
Commander Thad Allen said in an interview on CNN. Relief wells
will still be needed to permanently plug it, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP scrapped its dividend and said last month it will sell
some of its assets to raise $10 billion for cleanup costs, fines
and legal damages from the Gulf spill. The company said today it
has spent $3.5 billion on the spill. It agreed to establish a
$20 billion fund for damage claims with President Barack Obama
last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP is working to install a new, tighter-fitting cap over
its leaking well that it intends to capture all the escaping
crude. The old cap was removed to make way, allowing more oil to
escape until the new cap is secured sometime this week, Senior
Vice President Kent Wells said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells told reporters during a conference call that BP so
far is pleased with how the effort is proceeding. &#8220;Whatever the
flow is, we&#8217;ll capture it all at some point.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP fell 13 percent on June 1 after an attempt to plug the

Relief wells, which will intersect the damaged Macondo well near
the bottom to stop the flow of oil and gas, are running ahead of
schedule and may be completed this month, Allen said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Shares deserve to be well above 500 pence, but it&#8217;s not
going to get back to 600,&#8221; ING&#8217;s Kenney said. &#8220;Within three to
six months, you should have a significantly re-rated stock.
There&#8217;s limited material downside after the well is capped.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of insuring BP debt against default fell for the

&lt;p&gt;VeriSign Inc., the biggest operator
of computers that direct Internet traffic, must face an
antitrust lawsuit claiming it overcharged for .com and .net
domain names, a federal appeals court ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco-based court ruled July 9 that a lower
court was wrong to dismiss a suit filed by the Coalition for
ICANN Transparency. CFIT, an organization of Web site owners,
claimed VeriSign violated antitrust laws by charging
artificially high prices for the domain names and restrained
competition in its renewal contracts, according to the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VeriSign, based in Mountain View, California, operates the
.com and .net domain name registries under a contract with the
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers on behalf of
the U.S. Commerce Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its lawsuit, CFIT asked the lower court to block
VeriSign&#8217;s registration service for expiring domain names based
on claims VeriSign attempted to monopolize that &#8220;allegedly
separate market,&#8221; according to the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The district court &#8220;failed to appreciate the seriousness
of the allegations of anticompetitive conduct&#8221; and by rejecting
the existence of a separate market for expiring domain names,
&#8220;improperly relied on already outdated authority,&#8221; the appeals
court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sending the case back to district court, the appeals court
said it agrees with CFIT&#8217;s challenge of the terms and award of
contracts registering .com domain names, and with CFIT&#8217;s claim
that there&#8217;s a separate market for expiring domain names. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for VeriSign didn&#8217;t immediately return a call
seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;

Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glaxo Withheld Avandia Study, Ex-FDA Manager Said to Testify &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GlaxoSmithKline Plc withheld from regulators a study
showing its Avandia diabetes drug may cause heart attacks, a
former U.S. Food and Drug Administration official said,
according to two people familiar with her deposition in a
lawsuit against the drugmaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rosemary Johann-Liang, a former manager in the FDA&#8217;s
drug-safety unit, told lawyers suing Glaxo that the 2001 study
found Avandia posed a greater heart-attack risk than rival
medicines, the people said. Glaxo also didn&#8217;t turn over an e-
mail from researchers who concluded Avandia &#8220;strengthens the
signals&#8221; of heart ailments, she testified in a pre-trial
deposition last month, according to the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johann-Liang left the FDA in 2007 following her
recommendation that London-based Glaxo add more information
about health risks to Avandia&#8217;s label, the people said. Johann-
Liang stated that FDA officials provided the drugmaker with
details of internal agency discussions about beefing up the
warnings, according to the people, who also said she testified
the leaks &#8220;should not have happened&#8221; and violated FDA policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johann-Liang&#8217;s deposition may be considered by an FDA
advisory panel meeting this week in Washington to consider
whether Avandia&#8217;s ability to control blood-sugar levels
outweighs a possible increase in heart attacks, strokes and
deaths from cardiovascular disease, the people said. They
declined to provide a transcript of the testimony. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Glaxo officials contend no studies have proven that
Avandia is dangerous, drug-safety advocates have called for the
medicine&#8217;s withdrawal from the market. Actos, a similar diabetes
drug sold by Tokyo-based Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., poses less
of a heart-attack risk, researchers have found. Glaxo withheld a
study on Actos from the FDA, Johann-Liang testified, according
to the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glaxo Mary disputes Johann-Liang&#8217;s claims that it didn&#8217;t
turn over a 2001 review of Avandia&#8217;s health risks to federal
regulators, Mary Anne Rhyne, a company spokeswoman, said in an
e-mailed statement. The company&#8217;s study &#8220;determined that there
was no signal of an increased risk for heart attacks associated
with Avandia,&#8221; Rhyne said. &#8220;GSK identified this internal
review and described its results in a Periodic Safety Update

&lt;p&gt;Glaxo faces its first U.S. trial over Avandia in
Philadelphia federal court in October, Rhyne said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avandia was once the world&#8217;s best-selling diabetes pill,
generating annual revenue of $3 billion by 2006, including sales
of a combination pill called Avandamet. Sales plunged after a
May 2007 report in the New England Journal of Medicine linked
the drug to a 43 percent increased risk of heart attacks. That
prompted U.S. and European regulators to order Glaxo to
strengthen its warnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re Avandia Marketing, Sales Practices and
Products Liability Litigation, 07-01871, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s, SP, Fitch Seek to Dismiss Investors&#8217; Negligence Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s Investors Service Inc., Standard  Poor&#8217;s and Fitch
Ratings asked a judge July 9 to dismiss a lawsuit filed by two
California investors who claim the companies gave inflated
ratings to inferior bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ronald Grassi, a retired California attorney, and his wife,
a retired teacher, sued the New York-based companies over claims
they had a conflict of interest in rating Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. mortgage-backed bonds. The companies named the
bonds &#8220;investment grade&#8221; to achieve more sales of their rating
services and didn&#8217;t downgrade the bonds until Lehman filed for
bankruptcy in 2008, Grassi said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Magistrate Judge Dale A. Drozd in Sacramento threw out
the case in a March ruling, saying Grassi&#8217;s negligence and fraud
allegations weren&#8217;t specific enough. Grassi filed a more
detailed complaint in April. A similar case in state court in
San Francisco survived the companies&#8217; request for dismissal in
May, Grassi said in a filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m claiming the ratings agencies who spent 60 to 70
years becoming the only expert in town convinced everybody that
they knew what was going on,&#8221; Grassi said in a phone interview.
&#8220;When they say &#8216;investment grade,&#8217; they&#8217;re saying this is a
pretty safe bond; you&#8217;ll probably get your money back and
probably get your interest payments.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In court documents, the companies claim Grassi failed to
make a case that they owed him a &#8220;duty of care,&#8221; which is
required to support his negligence claim. Grassi&#8217;s second
complaint still lacks &#8220;substantive allegations about the
ratings of the Lehman bonds&#8221; and doesn&#8217;t include allegations
that the companies &#8220;made any false statements in connection
with the specific bonds at issue in this case,&#8221; they said in
court filings. As with similar suits filed in other states, the
companies also argue that credit ratings are statements of
opinion protected by the Constitution&#8217;s First Amendment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, Standard  Poor&#8217;s and Moody&#8217;s won dismissal of
a lawsuit seeking to hold them responsible for defrauding
investors who bought about $100 billion of mortgage-backed
securities. Connecticut and Ohio also sued the ratings
companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fitch is a unit of Paris-based Fimalac SA and Moody&#8217;s is a
unit of Moody&#8217;s Corp. Standard  Poor&#8217;s is a unit of McGraw-Hill
Cos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Grassi v. Moody&#8217;s, 09-00543, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of California (Sacramento). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Sued by Liberty on Fannie Mae Offering &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was accused in a lawsuit by
Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. of misleading investors in 2007
when it sold Fannie Mae preferred shares while betting against
the U.S. mortgage market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs misrepresented Fannie Mae&#8217;s health when it
underwrote the offerings, in which the insurer invested $62.5
million, according to a complaint filed July 8 in federal court
in Boston. The investment bank misstated the purpose of the sale
by saying the offering was to raise surplus capital when it was
actually needed to help Fannie Mae sustain its business, said
Liberty Mutual, which accused Goldman Sachs of securities fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As a knowledgeable and sophisticated investor in the U.S.
real estate financial markets, and with access to Fannie Mae&#8217;s
financial records, Goldman Sachs knew or recklessly disregarded
the actual status of Fannie Mae&#8217;s capital structure,&#8221; Liberty
Mutual said in the complaint. The mortgage guarantor was seized
by the U.S. in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, said the suit was without merit &#8220;and we will contest it
vigorously.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has come under fire from Congress and
regulators for its underwriting and investments as mortgage
markets collapsed during the credit crisis. The U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission sued Goldman Sachs in April, claiming it
sold a collateralized debt obligation without disclosing that a
hedge fund helped pick underlying securities and bet against the
vehicles. Goldman Sachs has denied wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time that it was underwriting the Fannie Mae
offering, Goldman was aware that there were &#8220;significant
problems&#8221; in the real estate market and bet its own money
against subprime-mortgage-related securities, Liberty Mutual
said in the complaint, which drew on documents collected by the
U.S. Senate&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documents, including internal Goldman Sachs e-mails,
establish that during the time leading up to the disputed
offerings, &#8220;Goldman Sachs not only knew about the serious risks
in the mortgage market, but it was urgently moving to short the
mortgage market,&#8221; the suit says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich Angevine, a spokesman for Liberty Mutual, declined to
comment. The Boston-based company is owned by policyholders and
isn&#8217;t publicly traded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Liberty Mutual v. Goldman Sachs, 10-cv-11150,
U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts (Boston). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JJ Sued by Consumers Over Children&#8217;s Cold, Allergy Medicines &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson  Johnson, the world&#8217;s largest health-products
company, was sued by U.S. consumers accusing it of fraud and
racketeering, and demanding cash refunds for recalled children&#8217;s
cold and allergy medicines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In five complaints seeking class-action, or group, status
filed July 8 in federal court in Chicago, the consumers spurned
an offer by JJ&#8217;s McNeil Consumer Healthcare and McNeil-PPC Inc.
units for refund coupons and demanded cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coupons are &#8220;worthless&#8221; because McNeil has stopped
making the medicines and &#8220;wrongly assumes that all consumers
will want to purchase the company&#8217;s children&#8217;s products at some
uncertain future date,&#8221; according to the complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies on April 30 recalled more than 40 types of
pediatric pain and allergy drugs saying their quality and
potency didn&#8217;t meet internal requirements. Among the products it
named were children&#8217;s formulations of liquid Tylenol, Motrin and
Benadryl. JJ&#8217;s over-the-counter medicines and nutritionals unit
had revenue of $1.21 billion in the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonnie Jacobs, a spokeswoman for New Brunswick, New Jersey-
based JJ, said consumers can request a refund or coupon at
mcneilproductrecall.com. She declined to comment further, saying
that as a policy the company doesn&#8217;t discuss litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaints say that purchasers who have used up or
thrown out the drugs without keeping receipts won&#8217;t be able to
avail themselves of the company&#8217;s recall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suits seek to proceed on behalf of plaintiffs&#8217; groups
for residents of Illinois, Texas and Florida, as well as
consumers in the U.S. and Canada, who have bought the drugs
since December 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Burrell v. McNeil Consumer Healthcare,
10cv4252; DeGroot v. McNeil Consumer Healthcare, 10cv4253;
Michaud v. McNeil Consumer Healthcare, 10cv4254; Nguyen v.
McNeil Consumer Healthcare, 10cv4255; Roberson v. McNeil
Consumer Healthcare, 10cv4256, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of Illinois (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air France-KLM Agrees to $87 Million Cargo Price Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air France-KLM Group and its Martinair Holland unit agreed
to pay $87 million to settle class-action lawsuits in the U.S.
accusing them of fixing prices for air-cargo shipments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal, which must be approved by a judge in New York,
will resolve claims by companies that purchased shipping
services to and from the U.S. by Air France, KLM and Martinair
between 2000 and 2006, the carriers said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases were filed in 2006 after the U.S. and the
European Union began probing dozens of companies, leading to a
series of settlements, fines and plea agreements by airlines and
executives. Air France, KLM and Martinair reached plea deals in
2008 to end the U.S. probe. The EU investigation is pending, Air
France said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probe was disclosed by U.S. and European Union
officials in February 2006. The EU issued complaints to 26
airlines the next year, after what regulators said were the
largest coordinated antitrust raids. Regulators in South Korea,
Canada and Australia have also fined carriers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cargo airlines often work together to carry freight,
setting aside as much as 10 percent of space for partners.
Carriers&#8217; price structures include surcharges that change
depending on factors such as oil prices and security measures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A call to Air France wasn&#8217;t immediately returned. EU
spokeswoman Amelia Torres declined to immediately comment on the
status of the probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legislation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. to Review Defamation Laws, Stem Flow of Libel Tourists &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. will review its anti-defamation laws to protect
freedom of speech after the nation became the destination of
choice for libel cases against journalists, academics and
scientists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government plans to propose legislation next year
following a public consultation, Justice Minister Tom McNally
said July 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K.&#8217;s strongly defined anti-defamation laws have
encouraged so-called libel tourism where overseas firms and
individuals pursue cases through the British courts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We want to ensure that the right balance is achieved so
people who have been defamed are able to take action to protect
their reputation but so that freedom of speech is not
unjustifiably impeded,&#8221; McNally told lawmakers in the upper
House of Lords. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peta Buscombe, a Conservative lawmaker and chairman of
newspaper watchdog, the Press Complaints Commission, told
lawmakers during the same debate that changes are &#8220;overdue.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labour Party lawmaker David Triesman, who stood down as
chairman of the Football Association after a newspaper reported
a private conversation in which he criticized other nations,
said a &#8220;savage&#8221;  media should not be given greater powers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have seen some newspapers, journalists and proprietors
-- although by no means all of them -- savage people who did not
deserve it and had no equal chance of fighting their corner,&#8221;
Triesman said in the same debate on July 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes should be made to the costs of bringing and
defending libel actions, which can cost &#8220;millions of pounds,&#8221;
said Dan Tench, a partner at Olswang LLP in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Many would say the real issue in respect to our libel law
is to do with the costs,&#8221; said Tench. &#8220;There&#8217;s not very much
libel tourism,&#8221; he said. &#8220;People say it&#8217;s commonplace, but
it&#8217;s really not.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. advised
buying five-year Spanish bonds against equivalent-maturity
German securities on &#8220;encouraging policy initiatives,&#8221;
including stress tests for European banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should bet the yield premium investors demand for
the Spanish debt will drop to 150 basis points, Noah Weisberger,
a New York-based trading strategist, wrote in a report received
today. They should end the bet if the spread closes at more than
210 basis points, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The recent policy initiatives have been encouraging,
particularly with respect to the stress tests,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield spread widened eight basis points to 209 basis
points as of 12:33 p.m. in London. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc., the maker of the iPad
and the iPhone, sued three sellers of computer equipment for
infringing a design patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brilliant Store Inc., of Fremont, California, and
Sunvalleytek International Inc., and Hootoo.com Inc., both of
Santa Clara, California, are accused of infringing Apple&#8217;s
patent D478,310, which was issued in August 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent covers the ornamental design of a power adapter
that&#8217;s used for Apple&#8217;s portable computers, such as the MacBook.
The complaint was filed July 9 in federal court in San
Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple said it &#8220;takes great creativity&#8221; to create designs
that focus on &#8220;all the details in a product that customers will
touch and see.&#8221; It&#8217;s suffered &#8220;irreparable harm&#8221; from the
three retailers&#8217; sale of knockoffs, the Cupertino, California-
based company claimed in its pleadings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to seeking a court order barring future
infringement, Apple asked the court for an award of litigation
costs and money damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple&#8217;s represented by Rosemary Theresa Ring, Andrew
Winston Song, and Gregory P. Stone from Los Angeles-based Munger
Tolles  Olson LLP and Perry J. Saidman from the Saidman
Designlaw Group LLC, of Silver Spring, Maryland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Apple Inc., v. Brilliant Store Inc., 3:10-cv-
02996-JCS, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
(San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FormFactor Settles Patent Dispute with Micronics Japan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FormFactor Inc., a maker of devices used to test computer
chips during the manufacturing process, settled a patent
infringement dispute with Tokyo-based Micronics Japan Co.,
according to court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FormFactor, of Livermore, California, sued Micronics in
federal court in San Francisco in November 2008, alleging
infringement of four patents for chip-testing technology. The
company earlier filed a complaint with the U.S. International
Trade Commission, seeking to halt importation of what it said
was infringing technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trade Commission said in November 2009 that there was
no violation of FormFactor&#8217;s patent rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As recently as June 14, the patent-infringement case in
federal court was far from resolution, with a hearing on the
scope of the patent set for June 2011. The court document
indicating settlement had been reached was filed June 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a July 9 FormFactor statement, no details of
the settlement agreement were released. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disputed patents were 6,509,751, 6,246,247, 6,624,648,
and 7,073,254. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case in federal court was FormFactor v. Micronics Japan
Co, 3:06-07159-JSW, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Seeks Patent on &#8216;Virtual Page Turn&#8217; for Devices &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s largest software company, has
applied for a patent on a technology that will give users the
ability to flip a page in a digital reading device just as they
can in a book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Application 20100175018, which was published in the
database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark office July 8, is for
what Microsoft calls a &#8220;virtual page turn.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology covered by the patent gives the electronic
device the ability to recognize a page-turning gesture by the
user. The device will then curl a portion of the virtually
lifted page to reveal the back side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This invention could be used with a &#8220;surface computer,
tablet computer, mobile communications device, personal data
assistant, desktop computer with a touch screen, laptop computer
with a touch screen, or virtually any other computing device
that utilizes a touch display,&#8221; Microsoft says in its
application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based software company filed the
application in January 2009. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Cuts Sony BMG Illegal Downloading Award by 90 Percent &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony BMG Music Entertainment and four other major music
labels were dealt a blow in their fight against illegal music
downloading and file sharing by a federal judge who cut their
damages award by 90 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Nancy Gertner said, in a 62-page order
July 9, that the $675,000 Joel Tenenbaum was ordered to pay was
too high, and cut it to $67,500. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The labels sued Tenenbaum in federal court in Boston in
2007, claiming they were damaged by his alleged copyright
infringement. Although Judge Gertner tried to open up the
proceedings to television coverage, she was rebuffed in April
2009 by a federal appeals court that accused her of exceeding
her discretion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said in her July 9 order that reducing Tenenbaum&#8217;s
damages sent the message that the U.S. Constitution&#8217;s due-
process clause protected &#8220;ordinary people&#8221; just as it
protected large corporations &#8220;from grossly excessive punitive
awards.&#8221; She could not find &#8220;any plausible rationale&#8221; for
Tenenbaum to pay $675,000 damages, she said, with the asymmetry
between the award and the music companies&#8217; actual damages &#8220;so
extreme as to jar the court&#8217;s sensibilities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She maintained that a penalty of $67,500 is, for Tenenbaum,
&#8220;significant and harsh.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Sony BMG Music Entertainment v. Tenenbaum,
1:07-cv-11446-NG, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts
(Boston). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Universal, Snoop Dogg Accused of Infringing Henderson&#8217;s Music &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Universal Music Group Inc. and the rap performer known as
Snoop Dogg are among the defendants in two copyright
infringement suits filed by jazz musician Michael Henderson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two suits, filed July 6 in federal court in Detroit,
related to the segments of Henderson&#8217;s music he claims is used
without his permission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henderson, who is known for having played fusion jazz with
Miles Davis, said Snoop Dogg&#8217;s &#8220;Ego Trippin&#8217;&#8221; album contained
a song &#8220;Flashbacks&#8221; in which his music is &#8220;featured
prominently&#8221; without his permission. Nick Carter&#8217;s &#8220;Fornever&#8221;
album is also accused of using unauthorized samples of
Henderson&#8217;s work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to asking for money damages, Henderson seeks
seizure and destruction of all infringing products, and an order
barring any future use of his work without authorization by the
defendants. He also requested awards for litigation costs and
attorney fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The musician is represented in both cases by Jeffrey P.
Thennisch of Dobrusin  Thennisch PC of Pontiac, Michigan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case against Snoop Dogg is Henderson v. Calvin Broadus,
2:10-cv-12674-RHC-MAR, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Michigan (Detroit). The other case is Henderson v. Carter, 2:10-
cv-12675-SFC-VMM, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Michigan (Detroit) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dueling Loch Ness Monster Attractions Settle Trademark Dispute &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trademark dispute between two competing attractions
focused on the mythic Loch Ness monster has been settled, the
University of Edinburgh&#8217;s School of Law&#8217;s Scots Law News
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Official Loch Ness Exhibition Centre claimed the public
was confused by the similarity between its name and that of the
Original Loch Ness Monster Center, which are about 100 yards
about in the Scottish town of Drumadrochit, according to Scots
Law News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the terms of the agreement, the Loch Ness Exhibition
Center will be known as the Loch Ness Center and Exhibition, the
Scots Law News reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Original Loch Ness Monster attraction has been renamed
the Nessieland Castle Monster Centre, according to the news. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indiana Black Expo to Restrict Unauthorized Trademark Use &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indiana Black Expo, a 40-year-old Indianapolis event
celebrating African American Culture, is beginning to enforce
its trademark rights against unauthorized vendors at its future
events, the Indianapolis Star reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merchants that hadn&#8217;t signed an agreement with the
exposition by July 9 will be ordered to shut down, the newspaper
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsanctioned bars and clubs will be asked not to use the
exposition&#8217;s name or logo, according to the Star. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exposition officials hope to generate revenue for
scholarships and programming from licensing the trademarks, the
newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toyota Loses Internet Domain Name Trademark Appellate Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toyota Motor Corp. lost a trademark-infringement case to a
California auto broker unrepresented by counsel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toyota sued Lisa and Farzad Tabari in federal court in Los
Angeles in 2003, objecting to their Fast Imports auto
brokerage&#8217;s use of photos of Lexus cars on their website.  The
automaker also objected to the inclusion of &#8220;Lexus&#8221; in their
Internet domain names. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The district court found that the Tabaris had infringed the
Toyota marks and ordered them to quit using &#8220;Lexus&#8221; anywhere
in the domain names. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tabaris filed an appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeal, and argued the case on their own in August 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a July 8 ruling, a three-judge panel said the trial
court reached too far. The panel noted that the domain names --
&#8220;we-are-definitely-not-lexus.com and &#8220;independent-lexus-
broker.com -- wouldn&#8217;t confuse a reasonable company into
thinking the Japanese automaker sponsored the sites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Prohibition of such truthful and non-misleading speech&#8221;
didn&#8217;t protect consumers, the appeals court said. &#8220;In fact, it
undermines the rational by frustrating honest communication
between the Tabaris and their customers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals panel told the trial court to modify its order
to allow at least some use of the Lexus mark in the Tabaris&#8217;
domain names. &#8220;Trademarks are part of our common language and
we all have some right to use them to communicate in truthful,
non-misleading ways,&#8221; the panel said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court also addressed the fact that the Tabaris
represented themselves. &#8220;Many of the district court&#8217;s errors
seem to be the result of unevenly-matched lawyering, as Toyota
appears to have taken advantage of the fact that the Tabaris
appeared pro se,&#8221; Judge Alex Kozinski wrote for the panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He suggested that to avoid similar problems in the future,
the court &#8220;might consider contacting members of the bar to
determine if any would be willing to represent the Tabaris at a
reduced rate or on a volunteer basis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Toyota Motor Sales v. Tabari, 07-55344, 9th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;University Technology Transfer &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spherix Takes License to University of Kentucky&#8217;s Technology &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spherix Inc.&#8217;s Biospherics unit has taken a license to
patent applications for a technology to lower level of
triglycerides found in blood, the company said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement will give the Bethesda, Maryland-based
company the rights to international patents for five drug
formulations developed at the university. More than 140 nations
are signatories to the patent cooperation treaty governing these
patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The connection between 43-yedr-old Spherix and the
university comes by way of its president, Professor Robert
Lodder of the University of Kentucky&#8217;s College of Pharmacy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buck Showalter is close to
completing a contract to become manager for the Baltimore
Orioles, FoxSports.com reports.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Showalter, 54, will probably join the Orioles after the
All-Star break as Major League Baseball discourages teams from
making major announcements during its showcase events, FoxSports
said, citing unidentified major-league sources.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Showalter had an 882-833 record as manager of the New York
Yankees, Arizona Diamondbacks and Texas Rangers from 1992-2006.
He&#8217;s been working as a major-league analyst for Walt Disney
Co.&#8217;s ESPN network.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Orioles fired Dave Trembley on June 4 and replaced him
on an interim basis with third-base coach Juan Samuel. Baltimore
has the worst record in the majors at 29-59 and trails the
first-place New York Yankees by 27 games in the American League
Eastern Division.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SA, the world&#8217;s
largest Spanish-language broadcaster, said second-quarter net
income fell 1.2 percent as cable programming costs increased. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income dropped to 1.8 billion pesos ($140.9 million)
from 1.83 billion pesos a year earlier, the Mexico City-based
company said today in an e-mailed statement. Sales climbed 14
percent to 14.4 billion pesos helped partly by programs around
the World Cup soccer games and advertising revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa introduced a pay sports channel called Televisa
Deportes Network in 2009 and added the cable news network Foro
TV this year to increase its production capabilities and boost
outlets for advertisers. Operating profit in the pay television
unit dropped 21 percent to 365 million pesos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financing costs jumped 39 percent to 1.15 billion pesos on
higher interest expenses and a larger foreign-exchange loss,
Televisa said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sky satellite TV unit added 251,000 customers for a
total of 2.45 million in the quarter. The company has been
paying for the right to broadcast the World Cup games on its Sky
Mexico satellite network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa rose 40 centavos to 48.23 pesos July 9 in Mexico
City trading. The shares have dropped 11 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Itau Unibanco Holding SA overtook
Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in Brazilian bond
underwriting, leading a push by local banks to grab market share
from international banks hurt by the global financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Itau, the country&#8217;s largest bank by market value, jumped
four spots this year to become the fourth-biggest manager of
overseas sales by the Brazilian government and companies, the
highest ranking for a local underwriter since Bloomberg began
tracking the data in 1999. Itau, based in Sao Paulo, has co-
managed offerings worth $5.1 billion this year, trailing only
HSBC Holdings Plc, Banco Santander SA and JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four Brazilian banks are among the top 10 underwriters, the
most since 1999, allowing them to benefit from a two-fold rise
in overseas issuance this year to $17.2 billion, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Brazilian banks held up better
during the financial crisis than their foreign counterparts,
with none of them appearing in a list compiled by Bloomberg of
the global firms posting the biggest losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Brazilian banks took over when the others were
concentrating on their international problems,&#8221; Ceres Lisboa, a
bank analyst at Moody&#8217;s Investors Service in Sao Paulo, said in
a telephone interview. They &#8220;filled the void,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banco do Brasil SA, the state-controlled lender based in
Brasilia, rose to seventh from 11th in 2009, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Osasco-based Banco Bradesco SA, the
country&#8217;s second-biggest bank by market value, climbed to eighth
from 13th and Banco Votorantim SA, the financial services unit
of Votorantim Group, is 10th after managing no transactions in
2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup&#8217;s Drop &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian banks&#8217; presence in underwriting &#8220;gained speed
during and after the crisis because some of the foreign banks
had reduced substantially their capability,&#8221; Alberto Kiraly,
head of investment banking of Banco Votorantim in Sao Paulo,
said in a telephone interview. Brazilian &#8220;banks have made
important progress,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central bank President Henrique Meirelles said in a
November interview in London that Latin America&#8217;s biggest
economy has been protected from a credit-driven asset bubble by
&#8220;strong prudential regulations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup, the New York-based bank that reported more than
$100 billion of credit losses and writedowns tied to the U.S.
subprime mortgage crisis, slid to 11th this year in Brazilian
bond underwriting from fourth in 2009, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sale Pickup &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Brazil is a priority market for Citigroup,&#8221; Alex Samuelson, a spokesman with the bank in New York, said in an e-
mailed response to questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Goldman Sachs, which reported losses and
writedowns of $9.1 billion, dropped to ninth from sixth. Credit
Suisse, the Zurich-based bank that posted losses and writedowns
of $20.4 billion, fell to 22nd from 10th in 2009 and third in
2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Credit Suisse spokeswoman in New York declined to
comment. Michael Duvally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman in New York,
didn&#8217;t return e-mails seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian bond sales are rebounding this month after the
European debt crisis pushed emerging-market borrowing costs
higher and snapped a record start in offerings. Sao Paulo-based
Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA sold $300 million of 10-year
bonds today, according to Bloomberg data. Brazil&#8217;s largest
airline hired Itau, Citigroup and Bank of America Corp. to
arrange the sale, said a person familiar with the transaction
who declined to be identified because he&#8217;s not authorized to
speak publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record Start &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian companies sold $1.1 billion of international debt
this month after issuing just one bond, worth $200 million, in
May and June. The $15 billion that companies sold from January
to April was the most on record for the first four months of a
year since Bloomberg began tracking the data in 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to hold Brazilian
corporate dollar bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries fell 13 basis
points to 328 at 5 p.m. New York time, according to JPMorgan&#8217;s
CEMBI index. The yield gap has declined 26 basis points since
reaching a 10-month high of 354 on May 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called spread on Brazilian government bonds over
Treasuries narrowed 14 basis points to 209, a two-month low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of credit-default swaps to protect against a
default on Brazilian debt for five years fell five basis points
to 121, according to data compiled by CMA DataVision. Credit-
default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the
underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a government
or company fail to adhere to its debt agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real rose 0.2 percent to 1.757 per dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing Competition &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International banks are seeking to win back market share in
Brazil after pulling through the financial crisis, boosting
competition for underwriting business, said Lisboa at Moody&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks have charged on average this year fees equal to 0.25
percent of the amount of debt sold to arrange Brazilian debt
offerings, down from 0.36 percent in 2009 and the lowest in at
least 11 years, Bloomberg data show. In the U.S. bond market,
banks have charged 0.33 percent on average this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Competition will be name of the game,&#8221; Lisboa said.
&#8220;Brazilian investment banks have positioned themselves in that
market and now they&#8217;re very strong.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS AG, Switzerland&#8217;s biggest bank, said in April it agreed
to buy the Brazilian brokerage Link Investimentos for about $112
million, a year after selling its Brazilian unit, UBS Pactual
SA, for $2.5 billion to raise capital following the crisis. UBS
ranks 20th in Brazilian underwriting this year, down from 18th
in 2009 and first in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pactual Hire &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Link purchase &#8220;will provide a platform to further
expand our business and product offering in the country,&#8221; Doug Morris, a UBS spokesman in New York, said in an e-mailed
response to questions. &#8220;UBS has remained very active with
Brazilian clients over the past several months.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS&#8217;s former Pactual unit, now known as Banco BTG Pactual
SA and owned by Brazilian billionaire Andre Esteves, said today
that it hired Sandy Severino in New York to underwrite
international debt sales. In April, Severino, who has worked at
Deutsche Bank AG and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., left
Citigroup, where he arranged Brazilian bond sales and syndicated
loans, BTG Pactual said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexandre Aoude, global head of fixed income at Itau in Sao
Paulo, said it won&#8217;t be as easy for foreign banks to re-enter
the market as it was years ago. Itau&#8217;s 10 transactions this year
include a $500 million offering by Marfrig Alimentos SA, the
world&#8217;s fourth-largest meatpacker, and a $750 million sale by
BRF Brasil Foods SA, the country&#8217;s biggest food producer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Before it was easy for them to leave and come back,&#8221;
Aoude said in a May 19 interview in New York. &#8220;They didn&#8217;t have
any type of local competition. Nowadays, every time that they do
that, we get more market share.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks surged, extending the 
longest rally for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index in three
months, as improving outlooks from companies such as Alcoa Inc. 
and Novellus Systems Inc. bolstered confidence in the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcoa Inc., the biggest U.S. aluminum producer and the
first company in the Dow Jones Industrial Average to report
second-quarter results, gained 1.2 percent as sales and profit
exceeded analysts&#8217; estimates and the company forecast stronger
global demand. Novellus rose 5.8 percent. ADC Telecommunications
Inc. jumped 41 percent after agreeing to be bought. All 10
industry groups in the SP 500 advanced, led by financial firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 climbed 1.5 percent to 1,095.34 as of 4 p.m. in
New York as all but 25 of its companies rose. The index closed 
higher for a sixth straight day for the first time since April. 
The Dow rallied 146.75 points, or 1.4 percent, to 10,363.02. 
Both gauges closed at the highest levels since June 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You basically had companies report not just good
quarters, but good guidance,&#8221; said Eric Green, director of
research at Penn Capital Management in Philadelphia, which
oversees $5 billion. &#8220;Not much caution about the future, which
is what everybody had feared the last several weeks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All four SP 500 companies that reported results from the
market&#8217;s close yesterday through the start of trading this
morning topped the average analyst estimate for per-share profit
in Bloomberg surveys. Novellus Systems Inc. advanced, while CSX
Corp. and Fastenal Co. retreated, both for the first time in
five days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novellus, Intel &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novellus gained 5.8 percent to $28.26. The maker of
semiconductor equipment said it expects 2012 revenue to exceed
$1.8 billion. Two analysts surveyed by Bloomberg estimated $1.51
billion, on average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the market closed, Intel Corp., the world&#8217;s largest
computer-chip maker, beat analyst estimates for second-quarter
sales and profit, reporting record sales. It forecast third-
quarter revenue above the average estimate. Intel is among 23
companies in the index to announce results this week. The shares
gained 5.2 percent to $22.10 in after-hours trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Profits for SP 500 companies are projected to have
increased 34 percent in the second quarter and by the same
amount in 2010, according to analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Everyone&#8217;s already looking for a very good second quarter
in terms of earnings season,&#8221; said Kevin Bannon, chief
investment officer at Highmount Capital LLC in New York, which
manages $1.8 billion. &#8220;To help push the market forward is going
to be a function of what managements say about the outlook.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greek Borrowing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stock futures rallied before the start of trading as
Greece sold 1.63 billion euros ($2.1 billion) of 26-week
Treasury bills at a rate below the 5 percent charged by the
European Union for its bailout package, easing concern the
nation faces punitive costs to borrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks rose yesterday, adding to gains from the
biggest weekly rally in a year for the SP 500, as analyst
upgrades of technology companies boosted optimism before the
start of the earnings season. The main benchmark for U.S. stocks
has rebounded more than 7 percent from a 10-month low on July 2.
It&#8217;s still down about 1.8 percent on the year, and 10 percent
since closing at a 19-month high on April 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock markets around the world have declined since mid-
April amid concern about the sustainability of the global
economic recovery as European governments attempt to cut budget
deficits, China takes steps to avoid asset bubbles and growth in
U.S. service and manufacturing industries slows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed&#8217;s Tools &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Federal Reserve officials said yesterday that the
central bank has no plans to deploy additional tools for
stimulating the economy and that the recovery is intact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. trade deficit unexpectedly widened 4.8 percent to
$42.3 billion in May, the highest level since November 2008, as
a gain in imports outpaced growth in exports, Commerce
Department figures showed. The deficit was projected to narrow
to $39 billion, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Alcoa, the largest U.S. aluminum producer, gained 1.2
percent to $11. The company said after trading hours yesterday
that rising sales of aluminum for packaging and commercial
transportation helped it report per-share earnings of 13 cents,
exceeding the 11-cent average estimate of 17 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. Global aluminum consumption will gain 12 percent
this year, compared with the company&#8217;s previous forecast of 10
percent, Alcoa said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials Companies &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials companies in the SP 500 rose 2.2 percent as a
group, and the financial, consumer discretionary, industrial,
technology and energy groups also rose at least 1.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. led gains in energy companies, rising 1.9
percent to $73.23. The second-largest U.S. energy producer
forecast higher earnings in the second quarter compared with the
previous three months. Separately, Chevron applied for a permit
to explore for natural gas in shale deposits in northeastern
Bulgaria near the Romanian border. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADC Telecommunications jumped 41 percent to $12.52. Tyco
Electronics Ltd., the world&#8217;s biggest maker of electronic
connectors, will pay $12.75 a share for the maker of broadband
equipment, 44 percent more than ADC&#8217;s closing price yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Aon Corp., the world&#8217;s largest insurance broker,
agreed to buy Hewitt Associates Inc., a pay and benefits
consulting firm. Takeover news &#8220;is reminding people that stocks
could be very cheap here,&#8221; Highmount&#8217;s Bannon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG, Invesco &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American International Group Inc. rose 6.8 percent to
$37.99, the most in the SP 500. The insurer&#8217;s board will likely
decide to sell its AIA unit in an initial public offering at a
meeting scheduled this week, Reuters reported, citing people who
are directly involved in the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invesco Ltd. climbed 6.5 percent to $19.43. The manager of
mutual funds and PowerShares exchange-traded funds reported
assets under management of $557.7 billion as of June 30, topping
William Blair  Co.&#8217;s estimate of $540.4 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc., the maker of iPhone mobile phones and the
company with the second-biggest weighting in the index, fell 2.1
percent to $251.80 for the third-biggest drop in the SP 500.
JPMorgan Chase  Co. said Apple&#8217;s iPhone 4 is getting
&#8220;prolonged negative&#8221; public relations after failing to win
Consumer Reports&#8217; recommendation. Mike Gikas, senior electronics
editor for Consumer Reports, said yesterday tests confirmed the
handset has a hardware flaw that causes signal quality to
degrade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSX, the third-largest U.S. railroad by 2009 revenue,
declined 1.4 percent to $51.72. Fastenal, a distributor of
industrial and construction supplies, fell 4.1 percent to
$50.44. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. directors should be held
liable for the drugmaker&#8217;s repeated violations of federal laws
governing drug-marketing practices that resulted in the company
having to pay a $2.3 billion settlement, a union pension fund
said in a lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Pfizer&#8217;s board turned a blind eye to
criminal guilty pleas the company entered over marketing
practices for medicines such its Bextra pain-killing drug and
its Neurontin epilepsy pill, the Bricklayers Local 8  Plasters
Local 233 Pension Fund, a Pfizer shareholder, said in the suit.
Directors&#8217; inaction has hurt the value of investors&#8217; stakes in
the company, the fund&#8217;s lawyers contend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The board and senior management made a calculated bet
that the negative consequences of getting caught would never
become significant,&#8221; the fund&#8217;s attorneys said today in the
Delaware Chancery Court complaint. &#8220;Defendants lost that bet.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $2.3 billion settlement to resolve government probes
into Pfizer&#8217;s marketing practices was the largest accord in
history to address such sales techniques. Proceeds from the
accord went to government health agencies including Medicare,
Medicaid and the military&#8217;s Tricare health plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, didn&#8217;t return calls and
an e-mail for comment on the suit. Pfizer is the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Red Flags&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has paid at least $2.7 billion to settle claims over
its marketing practices pressed by government regulators or by
consumers suing over its products, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the $2.3 billion it paid over Bextra and
other drugs, the company paid $430 million to resolve
prosecutors&#8217; claims that it illegally marketed Neurontin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fact that Pfizer has been operated with a systematic
disregard for the laws governing its fundamental business was
not hidden from the board, which repeatedly and knowingly
disregarded red flags that clearly demonstrated the company&#8217;s
wrongdoing,&#8221; the fund&#8217;s lawyers said in the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund wants directors held liable for the company&#8217;s
improper acts and seek to recoup &#8220;all profits, benefits and
other compensation&#8221; they reaped as board members. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bricklayers Local v. Ausiello and Pfizer Inc.,
CA5631, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. hired
Alastair Maxwell, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s head of energy investment
banking in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, to join the firm
in London, said a person with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maxwell will join Goldman in October, said the person who
declined to be identified because the appointment hasn&#8217;t been
made public. A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in London and a
spokesman for Morgan Stanley declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Morgan Stanley, Maxwell&#8217;s group worked with the
government of Ghana on offshore oil and gas deposits, advising
it when Kosmos Energy LLC tried last year to sell a stake in the
$3.1 billion Jubilee oil field to Exxon Mobil Corp. Goldman&#8217;s
energy clients include London-based BP Plc, which plans to raise
$10 billion selling assets as it tries to contain the worst oil
spill in U.S. history in the Gulf of Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil and gas industry is the second-biggest mergers and
acquisitions market by volume this year, with $78 billion of
announced transactions, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
BP&#8217;s $7 billion purchase of Devon Energy Corp. assets in Brazil,
Azerbaijan and the Gulf of Mexico was the biggest takeover, the
data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP is in talks to sell a stake in Alaskan assets to Apache
Corp. of the U.S. which may be worth $12 billion, people
familiar with the matter said July 11. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, the world&#8217;s second-
biggest merger adviser, hired JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Thomas M. Miles, who helped arrange takeovers for companies such as UAL
Corp.&#8217;s United Airlines and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miles, a managing director in JPMorgan&#8217;s MA group, will
take a similar role at Morgan Stanley when he joins later this
year, Morgan Stanley spokesman Mark Lake confirmed. Miles worked
at JPMorgan since 1994. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miles was part of the JPMorgan team that helped Chicago-
based UAL win an agreement in May to merge with Continental
Airlines Inc., creating the world&#8217;s largest airline. JPMorgan
stands to earn a $23 million fee for the assignment. Last year,
he advised Bristol-Myers, the New York drugmaker, on its $2.4
billion acquisition of Medarex Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley has been adding investment bankers from
competitors this year, hiring energy bankers Michael Johnson,
Jonathan Cox, and Eduardo Miras from Deutsche Bank AG and
Citigroup Inc. financial-services specialist Gary Shedlin.
Outside of the investment bank, it&#8217;s hired 100 bankers to offer
loan products to Morgan Stanley Smith Barney clients, and may
quintuple that number by 2011, according to a person with
knowledge of the strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley is the second-biggest adviser on mergers
announced globally this year, behind Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Credit Suisse Group AG and JPMorgan are ranked third and fourth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kazakhstan plans for the first time
to tax exports of crude oil from a venture led by Chevron Corp.,
in the government&#8217;s latest effort to seek a bigger share of
revenue from the country&#8217;s energy wealth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kazakhstan&#8217;s cabinet today approved a crude-oil export tax
of $20 a metric ton, said Farida Batyrbayeva, an Astana-based
spokeswoman at the Ministry for Economic Development and Trade.
The tax, which applies to most oil producers in the central
Asian nation, will take effect 30 days after it is published in
official media, she said by telephone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for TengizChevroil wasn&#8217;t immediately
available and didn&#8217;t respond to an e-mailed request for comment.
Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, owns 50 percent of
TengizChevroil, which operates the biggest field in Kazakhstan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new duty marks another step in the government&#8217;s
campaign to boost its share of revenue from the country&#8217;s most
valuable export. The government is also seeking a stake in the
Karachaganak field, by pursuing producers there for what it says
are unpaid taxes. It has already secured a share of the giant
offshore Kashagan project in the Caspian Sea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kazakhstan, which holds 3 percent of the world&#8217;s proven oil
reserves according to BP Plc, began taxing crude exports in May
2008, then cut the duty to zero from $139.79 a metric ton in
January 2009. The earlier tax applied to about 40 producers
including Karachaganak Petroleum Operating BV, in which BG Group
Plc and Eni SpA hold stakes, and KazMunaiGas Exploration
Production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TengizChevroil was exempt from the earlier duty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Clearly&#8217; Negative Impact &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The wider reintroduction of such duty will be a
significant charge for the majority of oil companies operating
in Kazakhstan,&#8221; Dominic Lewenz, head of oil and gas research at
Almaty-based Visor Capital, said in a note to investors today.
The tax will &#8220;clearly be negative&#8221; for the producers, though
its impact on each company would vary, Lewenz said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cabinet&#8217;s decision to begin taxing TengizChevroil came
after Kazakhstan&#8217;s economic crimes agency said on July 8 that
the prosecutor general&#8217;s office found that Chevron&#8217;s biggest
venture in the country had illegally produced 212 billion tenge
($1.4 billion) of oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government is also cracking down on Karachaganak, the
only major oil development without state participation.
Kazakhstan is seeking to buy a 10 percent stake in Karachaganak,
the country&#8217;s second-largest producing oil field. Chevron owns
20 percent of the venture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fraud Probe &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government has lodged claims for unpaid taxes against
Karachaganak&#8217;s owners, and the economic crimes agency said in
May it was investigating the Karachaganak venture for fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute over Karachaganak bears some similarity to
changes in ownership at the Kashagan project, the country&#8217;s
biggest oil development so far. Eni and its partners in
Kashagan, an offshore project in the Caspian Sea, agreed in 2008
to pay higher royalties and cede shares to state-run KazMunaiGaz
National Co., after the government condemned cost overruns and
delays there. The partners in Kashagan expect to produce first
oil in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TengizChevroil and Karachaganak together accounted for
about 45 percent of Kazakhstan&#8217;s 76.4 million tons in oil output
last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karachaganak Seeks Exemption &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karachaganak Petroleum has sought to recover more than $1
billion in export duties from the government through an
arbitration hearing in London, Energy Minister Sauat Mynbayev
said last September. The company said today in an e-mailed
statement that it should be exempted from export duties because
of the &#8220;tax stabilization provisions&#8221; within its production
sharing agreement, without giving details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kazakhstan would generate 60 billion tenge in additional
revenue this year from the new export duty, and 177 billion
tenge in 2011, Interfax reported today, citing Finance Minister
Bolat Zhamishev. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s stocks rose to the highest
level in more than two years on expectations that earnings of
local companies will remain strong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hindalco Industries Ltd., the nation&#8217;s biggest aluminum
producer, gained 1.2 after Alcoa Inc., the largest U.S. maker of
the metal, reported profit that beat analysts&#8217; estimates,
signaling economic recovery and higher demand for the metal.
Housing Development Finance Corp., a mortgage lender, rose 2
percent before tomorrow&#8217;s earnings report. Profit climbed 31
percent, according to a survey of nine analysts by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Metal, banking and infrastructure stocks are going to
post good results,&#8221; said Anu Jain, vice president at Mumbai-
based IIFL Private Wealth Management Ltd., which advises clients
on investment strategies for assets worth $1.7 billion. &#8220;We are
bullish on the markets. We are buying at every dip. The outlook
for growth and earnings remains strong.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bombay Stock Exchange&#8217;s Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
gained 48.70, or 0.3 percent, to 17,985.90, its highest since
Feb. 19, 2008. The measure climbed for a fourth day after the
International Monetary Fund said India&#8217;s economy may expand this
year at the fastest pace since 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange rose
0.3 percent to 5,400.65. The BSE 200 Index increased 0.4 percent
to 2,287.88. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hindalco added 1.2 percent to 151.3 rupees. Aluminum for
delivery in three months increased 39 percent on average in the
second quarter from a year earlier on the London Metal Exchange.
Alcoa forecast yesterday demand will rise, fanning optimism
about corporate earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steel Makers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tata Steel Ltd., the biggest producer of the alloy,
increased 2.2 percent to 508.8 rupees. JSW Steel Ltd., India&#8217;s
third-largest producer, added 1.7 percent to 1,101.15 rupees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Housing Development rose 2 percent to 3,064.3 rupees. State
Bank of India Ltd., the nation&#8217;s biggest lender, advanced 1.2
percent to 2,429.1 rupees. HDFC Bank Ltd., the third-biggest
lender, increased 1.1 percent to 2,072.55 rupees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reliance Industries Ltd., the nation&#8217;s most valuable
company, gained 1.7 percent to 1,074.3 rupees after CNBC-TV18
reported it&#8217;s in talks to buy its third shale gas asset in North
America, without saying where it got the information. Manoj Warrier, a spokesman for Reliance Industries, didn&#8217;t immediately
comment on the report when contacted by telephone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have a buy call on Reliance; we feel probably it&#8217;s
poised more towards the 1,140 rupees to 1,200 rupees zone in the
next six to eight months,&#8221; said IIFL&#8217;s Jain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cutting Prices &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infosys Technologies Ltd., the second-largest software
services provider, dropped 3.4 percent to 2,796.75 rupees, its
biggest decline since Sept. 24. Quarterly net income fell 2.6
percent to 14.9 billion rupees ($318.5 million) in the three
months through June from a year earlier. The average of 25
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg was for profit of 15.6
billion rupees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infosys Chief Executive Officer S. Gopalakrishnan cut
prices to retain and win business from customers in the U.S. and
Europe, where it gets about 90 percent of its sales. The euro&#8217;s
6.3 percent decline against the rupee in three months reduced
the value of European sales when converted to the local currency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., the largest software-
services provider, fell 2.2 percent to 774.65 rupees. Wipro Ltd.,
the third-biggest software exporter, lost 1.4 percent to 403.95
rupees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Ltd., a unit of the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker,
climbed for the first day in four after quarterly net income
rose. The shares advanced 2 percent to 1,223.85 rupees. Second-
quarter net income rose 11 percent from a year earlier to 346.9
million rupees, according to its stock market filing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overseas funds bought a net 34.7 billion rupees of Indian
equities on July 9, increasing total investments in the stocks
this year to 362.3 billion rupees, according to the nation&#8217;s
market regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflows from overseas reached a record 834.2 billion rupees
in 2009, exceeding the high set two years ago in local currency
terms, as the biggest advance in 18 years lured foreign funds.
They sold a record 529.9 billion rupees of shares in 2008,
triggering a record annual decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following were among the most active on the exchange: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idea Cellular Ltd. (IDEA IN) sank 5.9 percent to 66 rupees,
its steepest drop in almost two months. The telecom company was
downgraded to &#8220;sell&#8221; from &#8220;buy&#8221; by Suresh Mahadevan, an
analyst at UBS AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LML Ltd. (LML IN) surged by its daily limit of 20 percent
to 13.9 rupees, its highest close in more than two years. CNBC
television channel reported TVS Motor Co. may acquire the
scooter manufacturer&#8217;s assets, citing people it didn&#8217;t identify.
Cecil Dewars, a TVS Motor spokesman, declined to comment on the
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL IN) climbed 4.3 percent to 61.5
rupees. The nation&#8217;s largest wind-turbine maker won an order to
set up, operate and maintain two wind power plants in the states
of Maharashtra and Karnataka, it said yesterday in a statement
to the stock exchange. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup
Inc. and Morgan Stanley were sued by a Boston area-based fund
seeking reimbursement for losses related to subprime loans,
according to lawyers for the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cambridge Place Investment Management Inc., founded by ex-
Goldman Sachs Group bankers Martin Finegold and Robert Kramer,
lost more than $1.2 billion as a result of the banks&#8217; untrue
statements, the company claims in a complaint filed July 9 in
state court in Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks sold securities backed by mortgages that came
from a &#8220;small group of now notorious subprime mortgage
originators,&#8221; used faulty appraisals, accepted misleading
information in loan applications, and violated their own
standards for underwriting, the firm claims in the lawsuit. The
banks offered or sold $2.4 billion of residential mortgage-
backed securities using untrue statements, according to the
lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Wall Street banks conducted inadequate due diligence
and failed to satisfy their own responsibilities,&#8221; Cambridge
Place said in the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bundling of the riskiest type of mortgages into
securities played a role in turning the U.S. housing slump into
a global recession as foreclosures deflated bond values and
toppled Wall Street firms including Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives from Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan
Stanley declined to comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Cambridge Place Investment Management Inc. v.
Morgan Stanley, 10-2741, Suffolk Superior Court (Boston). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Seeks to Dismiss Ambac Suit Over Mortgage Deals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Group AG asked a judge to throw out an Ambac
Financial Group Inc. lawsuit over mortgage-backed securities
transactions, saying the bond insurer is too &#8220;sophisticated&#8221;
to claim it was fraudulently induced to take part in the deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Ambac division sued two units of Zurich-based Credit
Suisse in New York state court in January, alleging breach of
warranties, breach of repurchase and other damages in addition
to fraudulent inducement. Ambac said that a Credit Suisse unit
misstated the attributes of securitized loans and the
underwriting guidelines used to select them, Ambac Assurance
said in the complaint filed Jan. 12 in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse said in court filings July 8 that Ambac,
after agreeing to insure $175 million in home-equity lines of
credit in March 2007, didn&#8217;t perform a review of the underlying
loans in the securitization, which Credit Suisse underwrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Its decision to conduct no independent due diligence on
files and information equally available to it amounts to a
failure to take &#8216;reasonable steps&#8217; to protect itself against the
purported deception it now alleges,&#8221; DLJ Mortgage Capital and
Credit Suisse Securities said in the motion to dismiss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Poillon, a spokesman for New York-based Ambac,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Ambac Assurance Corp. v. DLJ Mortgage Capital,
Inc. 600070/2010, filed in New York State Supreme Court
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Bondholder Suit Can Go Forward, Judge Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawsuit claiming that Citigroup Inc. misled investors who
bought 48 of its corporate bonds issued from May 2006 to August
2008 can go forward, a federal judge in New York ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein yesterday denied part of a
motion by Citigroup to dismiss the suit, which was originally
filed in New York state court in 2008. The investors claim
Citigroup failed to disclose information about the bank&#8217;s
exposure to &#8220;toxic mortgage-linked exposures&#8221; that affected
its creditworthiness, according to an opinion by Stein. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs allege that when the facts about Citigroup&#8217;s
liabilities related to mortgage-backed investments became
public, its bonds &#8220;plummeted in value,&#8221; according to Stein.
Citigroup and the other defendants argued the investors lacked
legal standing to bring the claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit names as defendants Citigroup, its wholly owned
Citigroup Funding Inc. subsidiary, eight Citigroup trusts, 28
current and former Citigroup officers and directors and almost
80 banks that underwrote the bonds, according to Stein&#8217;s
opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danielle Romero, a spokeswoman for Citigroup, said the bank
is reviewing the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Louisiana Sheriffs&#8217; Pension and Relief Fund v.
Citigroup Inc., 602830/2008, filed in New York State Supreme
Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett May Be Deposed in Berkshire Hathaway Lawsuit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett, the billionaire chief executive officer of
Berkshire Hathaway Inc., may be ordered to submit to questioning
under oath in a wrongful-dismissal lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brad Mart, a former executive at Berkshire unit Forest
River Inc., petitioned for a deposition of Buffett to
demonstrate the parent company&#8217;s role in his firing, according
to a June 17 motion in federal court in South Bend, Indiana.
Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire, one of the defendants named in
Mart&#8217;s lawsuit, has said it wasn&#8217;t involved in the dismissal. In
a July 6 brief, Berkshire asked the court to protect Buffett
from questioning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett isn&#8217;t accused of wrongdoing. His deposition would
help determine facts of the case, and may lead to his testimony
at trial. Buffett didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mail
request for comment sent to an assistant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mart has also asked to depose Berkshire Chief Financial
Officer Mark Hamburg and Secretary Forrest Krutter. The company
offered Hamburg in exchange for Mart&#8217;s renouncing his request
for depositions of other executives including Buffett, according
to court filings. Mart rejected that offer. Berkshire&#8217;s Krutter
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mart&#8217;s lawyer, Stephen Kennedy, of Kennedy Clark  Williams
PC in Dallas, said it would be inappropriate to comment. Kennedy
made the deposition request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Christopher Nuechterlein scheduled a hearing for July
26 to consider Mart&#8217;s requests for discovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Mart v. Berkshire Hathaway Inc., 3:10-cv-00118,
U.S. District Court, Northern District of Indiana (South Bend). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, Drug Companies Must Face Price-Fixing Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, and other drug
companies must face a price-fixing suit claiming they conspired
to keep cheaper medicines from Canada out of the U.S. market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The California Supreme Court yesterday reversed a lower
court, which two years ago granted dismissal of the suit by
allowing the companies to use a &#8220;pass-on&#8221; defense. The
companies argued they couldn&#8217;t be held liable for illegal drug
overcharges -- and that the pharmacies weren&#8217;t harmed -- because
any overcharge was passed on to consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling means that in California &#8220;no price-fixer is
going to get off on the basis that the victim might have passed
on to its customers the amount of the price fix,&#8221; Joseph M.
Alioto, a lawyer representing pharmacies said in an interview.
&#8220;Price fixers cannot raise this defense against anybody.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A California appeals court had upheld a trial judge&#8217;s
dismissal of the suit, filed in 2004, against Pfizer and 18
other pharmaceutical makers alleging they inflated drug prices,
leading drugstores to pay more than they should have. The court
ruled retailers passed the alleged price increases onto their
customers, so they can&#8217;t seek damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the California high court rejected that argument
and sent the case back to the trial court in Oakland, Alioto
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer spokesman Chris Loder said he couldn&#8217;t comment on
the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defendants include Eli Lilly  Co., AstraZeneca Plc,
and GlaxoSmithKline Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is James Clayworth v. Pfizer, S166435, California
Supreme Court (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Loses Control Over Nanso Golf Club in Japan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lost management control of
bankrupt Nanso Country Club outside Tokyo after a court accepted
a petition by members to remove executives appointed by the Wall
Street firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tokyo District Court on July 6 appointed attorney Yuzo
Miyama to take over management of Nanso Country Club, Kunihiko
Nishimura, a lawyer representing members, said in an interview.
Miyama replaced Shigeki Kiritani, a Goldman Sachs managing
director who was overseeing the club&#8217;s operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs bought Nanso Country Club in November 2006
and took it into bankruptcy protection in January this year.
Members last month voted against a rehabilitation plan proposed
by the Wall Street firm, citing concerns that Goldman Sachs
would allow more visiting players onto the course, depressing
the value of memberships that cost about 1 million yen
($11,225). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiroko Matsumoto, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman for Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment on the court decision or say how much
the company paid for the club. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs mainly owns golf courses in Japan through its
Accordia Golf Co. affiliate, which the U.S. bank took public in
2006 and owns 45 percent of. Accordia, based in Tokyo, owns 130
golf courses in Japan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Asks Courts to Dismiss Challenge to Drilling Ban &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interior Secretary Kenneth Salazar asked two New Orleans
courts to dismiss an industry lawsuit challenging a U.S. deep-
water drilling moratorium, saying a new drill ban made the suit
irrelevant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Martin Feldman in New Orleans on June
22 threw out the six-month ban imposed by federal regulators on
oil and gas drilling in waters deeper than 500 feet, finding it
was too broad. A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans on July 8 refused
regulators&#8217; request to put Feldman&#8217;s order on hold while the
government appeals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Salazar issued a revised ban that may allow new
wells if the industry shows it has raised safety standards. The
new policy replaces the earlier ban and renders the challenge to
it moot, U.S. Justice Department lawyers said yesterday in
filings with both courts in New Orleans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first drilling suspension &#8220;has been revoked and
superseded by a new directive issued yesterday that is based on
additional information, separate analysis and a separate
administrative record,&#8221; lawyers for the U.S. said in the
district court filing. The lawsuit should be withdrawn &#8220;because
the decision challenged by the plaintiffs&#8217; complaint no longer
exists,&#8221; the U.S. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama initially imposed a six-month
suspension on deep-water drilling in reaction to the BP Plc oil
spill, the worst in U.S. history, caused by the sinking of the
Deepwater Horizon drilling rig off the Louisiana coast in April.
Obama said the moratorium is needed to give a presidential
commission time to study offshore operations safety. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hornbeck Offshore Services Inc. and more than a dozen other
offshore service and supply companies sued U.S. regulators,
including Salazar, last month, seeking to block the moratorium. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve just received the decision memorandum of the
government,&#8221; Carl Rosenblum, Hornbeck&#8217;s lawyer, said in a phone
interview. &#8220;We&#8217;re still evaluating it, but we have substantial
concerns about whether it is consistent with Judge Feldman&#8217;s
order.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Switzerland Won&#8217;t Extradite Polanski Over 1977 Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Swiss government freed director Roman Polanski from
house arrest after refusing to extradite him to the U.S. in a
case tied to a more than 30-year-old sex scandal in California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polanski was released from electronic monitoring at his
chalet in Gstaad, Switzerland, Justice Minister Eveline Widmer-
Schlumpf said yesterday at a press conference. She said the U.S.
refused to release documents to support its extradition request.
Polanski, whose films include &#8220;The Pianist&#8221; and &#8220;Chinatown,&#8221;
is wanted for unlawful sexual conduct with a 13-year-old girl. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Oscar-winning director was arrested at Zurich airport
on Sept. 26, as he arrived to collect an award at the city&#8217;s
film festival. Polanski, 76, was held in a Swiss jail before
being placed under house arrest at his holiday home. He still
would be arrested if he returns to the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film director was initially charged on six felony
counts alleging he drugged and raped the teenager in 1977. He
later pleaded guilty to one count of unlawful sexual conduct
with a minor after the lawyer for the girl&#8217;s family asked
prosecutors to avoid a jury trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Widmer-Schlumpf said the U.S. refused to disclose trial
records that would shed light on Polanski&#8217;s claim he served his
sentence by spending 42 days under psychiatric evaluation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Considering the persisting doubts concerning the
presentation of the facts of the case, the request has to be
rejected,&#8221; the ministry said on its website. It also cited
issues of &#8220;good faith&#8221; as the U.S. never previously sought
Polanski&#8217;s extradition by Switzerland, where he is a regular
visitor and has owned a home since 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Widmer-Schlumpf said the U.S. can&#8217;t appeal the ruling
through the Swiss courts, and is unlikely to do so through an
international tribunal. She said she discussed the case at
length with the U.S. Embassy in Bern, and &#8220;they understand the
reasoning. I expect a further good cooperation with the U.S.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State Department spokesman Philip J. Crowley said the
U.S. was &#8220;disappointed&#8221; by the Swiss decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The rape of a 13-year-old girl by an adult who should
know better and does know better is a crime,&#8221; said Crowley.
&#8220;We will continue to seek justice in this case, and we will
evaluate our options.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

Polanski, A334139, California Superior Court (Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas Rangers Sued by Greenberg-Ryan Group Over Sale &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas Rangers were sued by a bidder group led by Nolan Ryan and Chuck Greenberg accusing the Rangers of breaching a
sale agreement for the Major League Baseball club. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rangers violated the deal by soliciting and negotiating
with other potential buyers, the Greenberg-Ryan group said in
court papers filed yesterday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Fort Worth, Texas. William Snyder, the chief restructuring
officer for the equity owners, has said the Rangers may
negotiate with a new buyer to lead off bidding at an auction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The CRO does not, and never had, any authority to solicit
alternative bids or negotiate with prospective bidders,&#8221; the
Greenberg-Ryan group said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snyder declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After filing for bankruptcy in May, the Rangers sought
court permission to sell the club to a group led by Greenberg,
an attorney, and Nolan Ryan, a Hall of Fame pitcher and the
team&#8217;s president, in a transaction it valued at $575 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Texas Rangers Baseball Partners, 10-
43400, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas (Fort
Worth). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barnes  Noble Testimony Centers on Aletheia Fund &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnes  Noble Inc.&#8217;s fight with billionaire Ron Burkle&#8217;s
Yucaipa Cos. for seats on the bookseller&#8217;s board of directors
may hinge on an alliance of Yucaipa with the investment fund
Aletheia Research  Management Inc., according to court
testimony. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Aletheia, the third largest shareholder of Barnes 
Noble, teams with No. 2 stakeholder Yucaipa, the two would be a
&#8220;much more formidable&#8221; opponent for the company&#8217;s chairman and
controlling stockholder, Leonard Riggio, Yucaipa&#8217;s proxy expert
testified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel H. Burch, chief executive officer of MacKenzie
Partners Inc., the expert, testified yesterday before Delaware
Chancery Court Judge Leo Strine Jr. in Wilmington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In support of the company&#8217;s poison pill anti-takeover
defense, a Barnes  Noble expert, Peter C. Harkins, chief
executive of DF King  Co., told Strine that a Yucaipa victory
for three vacant seats is &#8220;mathematically possible and
realistically attainable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yucaipa sued Barnes  Noble, the largest U.S. bookstore
chain, in May, saying Riggio and other directors launched a
&#8220;self-dealing scheme designed to entrench the Riggio family&#8221;
and stop Burkle from accumulating shares and gaining board
seats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial continues today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total Contesting Court Rulings on Dunkirk Refinery in France &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total SA, Europe&#8217;s largest refiner, has filed two legal
motions contesting rulings on the Dunkirk refinery in northern
France that it shut in September because of falling demand for
fuels such as diesel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total is disputing a June 30 Douai Court of Appeal ruling
ordering it to restart the facility by July 16, Frederic Texier,
a Paris-based company spokesman, said yesterday in a telephone
interview. The refiner is also asking the Nanterre Court to
&#8220;recognize that Total followed the rules in informing unions
and consulting with staff&#8221; about plans for the site, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total has to pay 100,000 euros ($125,870) a day in the
event the refinery isn&#8217;t restarted, according to the Douai Court
of Appeal ruling. The court found that the company didn&#8217;t follow
proper procedures for informing workers about its plans for a
permanent shutdown, according to the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case was brought by labor unions that opposed the oil
company&#8217;s decision to shutter the plant, which lost more than
130 million euros last year. To protest the closure, Total
workers embarked on nationwide strikes in February, leading to
fuel shortages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosneft CEO to Testify in Khodorkovsky Case, Interfax Reports &lt;/p&gt;

will testify in the trial of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the convicted
owner of OAO Yukos, and his former business partner Platon
Lebedev, Interfax reported, citing defense lawyer Konstantin
Rivkin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bogdanchikov was summoned by Moscow&#8217;s Khamovniki District
Court to give evidence, with the date yet to be set, the Moscow-
based new agency said, citing Rivkin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AB InBev Wins Dispute Over Ownership of Modelo Stake &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anheuser-Busch InBev NV, the world&#8217;s largest brewer, said
it won a dispute over its ownership of a 50 percent stake in
Grupo Modelo SAB, reigniting speculation that it may bid for the
rest of the Mexican beermaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An arbitration panel ruled that the 2008 merger of InBev NV
and Anheuser-Busch Cos. didn&#8217;t violate an agreement over the
transfer of the Budweiser maker&#8217;s stake in Modelo, Leuven,
Belgium-based AB InBev said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.
The panel awarded no damages or other remedies, the brewer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modelo, Mexico&#8217;s largest beermaker, had sought $2.5 billion
in damages in a claim that originally sought to prevent
Anheuser-Busch from selling its stake to InBev as part of the
$52 billion merger that led to AB InBev&#8217;s creation. The panel&#8217;s
ruling means AB InBev can keep the stake and make plans to
acquire the maker of Corona, Evolution Securities Ltd. analyst
Andrew Holland said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My guess is that AB InBev will be keen to sit down with
the controlling shareholders of Modelo to discuss an
acquisition,&#8221; Holland said. &#8220;InBev would be keen to buy all of
Modelo. It&#8217;s an attractive company in an attractive market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling doesn&#8217;t change Modelo&#8217;s corporate structure or
the way the Mexican brewer is operated, Jennifer Shelley, a
Modelo spokeswoman, said in a telephone interview. Any action
regarding ownership of Modelo is a decision for the controlling
shareholders, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexican families including the family of Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Carlos Fernandez own a majority of a holding
company that controls Modelo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AB InBev spokeswoman Karen Couck declined to comment on the
possibility of a future transaction with Modelo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenji Nakanishi, a former JPMorgan
Chase  Co. banker elected to Japan&#8217;s parliament two days ago,
said he will fight proposed legislation to strengthen the state-
owned postal savings system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nakanishi, 46, was one of 10 members of &#8220;Your Party&#8221; to
win seats in elections for the Diet&#8217;s upper house. The new party
will oppose the government plan to double the cap on deposits at
the nation&#8217;s postal bank to 20 million yen ($225,000) and keep a
stake in the company after taking it public, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Naoto Kan&#8217;s Democratic Party of Japan lost
its majority in the upper house and coalition partner the
People&#8217;s New Party failed to win any seats in the July 11 vote.
PNP head Shizuka Kamei is the driving force behind the Japan
Post bill, which Kan delayed before the election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What Japan should do is to invigorate the private
sector,&#8221; Nakanishi said in an interview. &#8220;What the DPJ and
Kamei&#8217;s party are doing is totally the opposite. Japan Post&#8217;s
government links will hurt other banks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kan&#8217;s party still controls the more powerful lower house,
though without the two-thirds majority needed to overrule
objections from the upper chamber. Your Party leader Yoshimi Watanabe has ruled out joining the coalition, saying he
preferred to work with the government on policies where he
shares a common perspective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamei&#8217;s proposed legislation would allow Japan Post Bank
Co., the world&#8217;s biggest bank by deposits, to double the amount
of savings it takes from individual customers and potentially
start offering loans. The government plans to keep at least a
one-third stake in Japan Post after an initial public offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stake Sale &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government should sell its entire stake in Japan Post
and keep the deposit cap no higher than 10 million yen to
prevent it from discouraging private sector competition,
Nakanishi said. More than half of the savings are used to
purchase Japanese government bonds.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nakanishi, who quit as JPMorgan&#8217;s Japan deputy president
last year, won a seat in Kanagawa prefecture, southwest of
Tokyo. Other victorious Your Party candidates included Kouta
Matsuda, former president of Tully&#8217;s Coffee Japan Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than half of 1,318 investment bankers and executives
surveyed by BizReach Inc., a Tokyo-based recruitment company,
said in May they may support the new party. The survey was open
to 24,000 registered users of the firm and conducted between May
10 and May 14. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. is paying developers
to build mobile applications for its Windows Phone 7 system to
help it narrow a lead by rival products from Apple Inc. and
Google Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is providing financial incentives ranging from
free tools and test handsets to funds for software development
and marketing, said Todd Brix, a senior director at Microsoft
who works with app developers. In some cases, Microsoft is
providing revenue guarantees, and will make up the difference if
apps don&#8217;t sell as well as expected, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft revamped its flagship mobile operating system to
recoup market share lost to Google and Apple. To win consumers,
the world&#8217;s largest software maker needs an ample supply of
games, music and navigation apps when handsets with Windows
Phone 7 reach stores later this year. Some developers may be
reluctant to sign up before they know Windows Phone will lure
enough customers, said Kevin Burden, an analyst at ABI Research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In no way do they want to say, &#8216;Trust us, there will be
apps at some point,&#8217;&#8221; said Burden, who is based in Hopkinton,
Massachusetts. &#8220;If that means paying developers, so be it. It&#8217;s
a good strategy for them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, has used
similar compensation programs for previous versions of its
mobile operating system, it&#8217;s devoting a larger sum this time,
Brix said. He declined to say how much Microsoft will spend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Open for Business&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are investing a lot to attract developers big and small
to Windows Phone 7 to let them understand what the opportunity
is and provide as many resources as we can to help them be
successful on our platform,&#8221; Brix said. &#8220;We&#8217;re open for business
and we want to work with them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft needs a hit to turn around its mobile business,
which Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said this week
&#8220;missed a generation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows accounted for 6.9 percent of the worldwide
smartphone-software market in the first quarter, from 10.8
percent a year earlier, according ABI. Shipments of the iPhone
rose to 15.8 percent, while Android handsets had 9.9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least four app makers have been approached by Microsoft
and offered financial incentives in cash, assistance with
development costs or revenue guarantees in exchange for having
apps ready at or near the release of Windows Phone 7, said five
people with knowledge of the matter. The people declined to be
named because the incentive terms are confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fewer Apps Than Apple &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other mobile software makers use different approaches to
entice programmers. Apple shares a portion of the revenue
generated when consumers buy apps from its online store. With
more than 51 million iPhones sold since its 2007 debut,
Cupertino, California-based Apple hasn&#8217;t offered payments like
Microsoft&#8217;s incentives to gain programs, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple has about 225,000 apps available for the iPhone,
while devices that run on Google&#8217;s Android operating system have
access to some 65,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is starting from scratch in amassing apps for
Windows Phone 7. Its overhaul of the operating system was so
complete that programs developed for older Windows-based phones
won&#8217;t work on the new one. At the end of last year, Microsoft
had only 246 apps, according to ABI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft rose 31 cents to $25.44 at 4 p.m. New York time
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares have declined 17 percent
this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s deep pockets and the likelihood it will keep
investing in Windows Phone 7 mean Microsoft may have an easier
time luring developers than a smaller company, Burden said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Unproven Prospect&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers expect Windows Phone 7 to be successful, three
of the people said. Yet it&#8217;s difficult to get companies to build
software for an operating system that doesn&#8217;t exist yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s absolutely less enthusiasm today for Windows Phone
7 -- developers develop for the platform with largest number of
users because that&#8217;s where they can make the most money,&#8221; said
Matt Rosoff, an analyst at Directions on Microsoft in Kirkland,
Washington. &#8220;Windows Phone 7 is an unproven prospect. It
definitely makes sense for Microsoft to prime the pump a little
bit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Microsoft scrapped an effort to sell its own
phone, less than two months after the device debuted. Sales of
the Kin social-networking phones fell short of the company&#8217;s
expectations, a person familiar with the matter said then. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. lender by assets, named Jeff Urwin and Kevin Willsey as co-heads of investment banking for the U.S. and
Canada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pair succeed Doug Braunstein, who was named chief
financial officer of the bank in June, according to an internal
memo dated today from Jes Staley, chief executive officer of the
investment-banking unit at New York-based JPMorgan Chase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staley said investment bank co-chair Jimmy Lee will
&#8220;continue to serve as our senior dealmaker and manage many of
our top client relationships.&#8221; He&#8217;ll also be an adviser to
Urwin and Willsey, Staley said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urwin, 54, joined the firm when it acquired Bear Stearns
Cos. in 2008 and Willsey, 47, was previously JPMorgan&#8217;s chairman
of global equity capital and derivative markets. Willsey, who
started at JPMorgan in 1989, rejoined the bank in 2002 after a
two-year stint at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Both Jeff and Kevin are outstanding individuals with
impeccable character and a drive to serve clients,&#8221; Staley told
employees in the memo, which was confirmed by spokeswoman Tasha Pelio. Staley said the two will manage the business jointly,
focusing on their own areas of expertise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urwin was JPMorgan&#8217;s head of investment banking coverage of
the Americas. He previously was co-head of investment banking at
Bear Stearns, which he joined in 1996, and head of global
emerging markets at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa, Wells Fargo Deals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Willsey has raised capital for clients in the U.S., Europe,
Asia and Latin America, according to JPMorgan. He has managed
major financing deals, including Visa Inc.&#8217;s $19.7 billion
initial public offering, Wells Fargo  Co.&#8217;s $12.6 billion
equity offering used to acquire Wachovia Corp. and JPMorgan&#8217;s
own $11.5 billion equity deal to acquire assets of Washington
Mutual Inc., the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee, 57, advised UAL Corp.&#8217;s United Airlines on its $3.1
billion merger with Continental Airlines Inc. earlier this year.
He also helped General Electric Co. sell a majority stake in NBC
Universal to Comcast Corp. last year and led negotiations with
the U.S. Treasury Department on behalf of Chrysler LLC bank-debt
holders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poland chose Citigroup Inc., Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase  Co. and UBS AG to manage the
initial public offering of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, central
Europe&#8217;s biggest equity market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ipopema Securities SA, KBC Groep NV, Societe Generale SA,
and PKO Bank Polski SA will be bookrunners for the November
offering of a 63 percent stake, the Treasury Ministry said on
its website today. Bank Ochrony Srodowiska SA, Alior Bank SA,
Banco Espirito Santo SA, IDM SA and Wood  Co. will also help
manage the offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale is part of a government plan to raise 25 billion
zloty ($7.8 billion) in 2010 to help finance the widening budget
deficit. Poland this year sold stakes in insurance, energy,
copper and coal mining companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poland&#8217;s only stock exchange has total capitalization
exceeding $150 billion, according to Bloomberg data. More than
500 companies trade on its main market and NewConnect platform
for smaller companies. The Treasury Ministry didn&#8217;t give any
valuation for the stake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poland last year tried to sell a majority stake in the
bourse, soliciting bids from the London Stock Exchange Group
Plc, NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. and Deutsche Boerse
AG. It received no binding offers. &lt;/p&gt;

nine months, a spokeswoman for Microsoft in Moscow, who declined
to be identified in line with company rules, said by e-mail
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia&#8217;s Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the news
when contacted by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten members of the spy ring pleaded guilty to conspiring to
serve as unregistered foreign agents on June 8 in a U.S. federal
court in Manhattan. They admitted to carrying money or coded
messages, secretly communicating with Russian officials and
instructing others on how to find information useful to Russia.
Their objective was to infiltrate U.S. policy-making circles
after constructing false American identities, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karetnikov was deported on charges of violating U.S.
immigration laws, Itar-Tass reported, citing Matt Chandler, a
spokesman for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
Karetnikov admitted to the violation and agreed to deportation
to avoid court proceedings, the state-run news service said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software Company &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Facebook page of a person identified as Alexey
Karetnikov shows that he is married and graduated from St.
Petersburg State Polytechnic University in 2009. He worked for a
company called &#8220;Neobit&#8221; in addition to Microsoft, according to
the Facebook page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A St. Petersburg-based software developer called OOO NeoBIT
lists Katernikov&#8217;s university among its partners and the Federal
Security Service, the main successor to the Soviet-era KGB,
among its clients, according to the company&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one at NeoBIT&#8217;s offices answered repeated calls from
Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strategic Forecasting Inc. said yesterday another member of
the ring tried to get the risk advisory group to install
software he said his company had developed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assumed Names &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man calling himself Donald Heathfield held five meetings
with an employee of Austin, Texas-based Stratfor in an effort to
get the firm to use his program, Chief Executive Officer George Friedman said in an e-mailed report. Heathfield, who later
identified himself as Andrey Bezrukov, was one of 10 people U.S.
authorities traded for four Russians on July 9 in Vienna. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We suspect that had this been done, our servers would be
outputting to Moscow,&#8221; Friedman said. &#8220;We did not know at the
time who he was. We have since reported the incident to the
FBI.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bezrukov and his partner in the network were sentenced to
time served and deported after agreeing to give up their home on
Trowbridge Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and all the funds
in four bank accounts. Bezrukov&#8217;s partner, who was identified as
Tracey Foley at the time of her arrest, told the court her real
name was Elena Vavilova. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bezrukov, Vavilova and the other members of the spy ring
are being debriefed at the Foreign Intelligence Service&#8217;s
compound in southern Moscow, Moskovsky Komsomolets, Russia&#8217;s
second-biggest newspaper by circulation, reported yesterday,
citing unidentified Russian security officials. That process may
last weeks, the Moscow-based daily said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the 10 agents may continue to work with the
security service, while others will be free to pursue new
careers, Moskovsky Komsomolets said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TPG Capital and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc.&#8217;s buyout arm are seeking to raise at least 670 million
euros ($851.7 million) of financing to back their bid to buy
Belgian diaper maker Ontex NV, three people familiar with the
situation said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders including Bank of America Corp. and Goldman Sachs
are working on loans, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the talks are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candover Investments Plc, a London-based private equity
firm, has been seeking at least 1.2 billion euros to sell
Ontex for a year, according to people with knowledge of the
situation. The company&#8217;s cash flow rose 59 percent to 150.3
million euros in 2009, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sophie Bullock, a London-based spokeswoman for Goldman
Sachs, and a spokesman for TPG in London declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candover acquired Zele, Belgium-based Ontex in 2003. After
raw material and transport costs climbed, the company was forced
to sell assets in 2007 to pay down debt, restructuring 700
million euros of senior and mezzanine loans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kathy Matsui, an investment
strategist in Japan for Goldman Sachs Group Inc., cut her three-
month estimate for the Topix index by 5.3 percent, citing
political uncertainties and the yen&#8217;s appreciation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matsui lowered the target to 900 from 950, according to a
report dated yesterday, when the gauge closed at 854.39. The
strategist cut her six-month estimate to 950 from 1,000 and the
12-month prediction to 1,020 from 1,150, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Topix fell 0.8 percent in the previous two days after
the ruling Democratic Party of Japan lost control of the upper
house in a weekend election. The yen climbed a week ago to near
its highest level in seven months as concerns over the health of
the global economy caused some investors to seek refuge in
Japan&#8217;s currency. A stronger yen hurts the value of export
revenue that is repatriated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the short term, political uncertainties will likely
mount and the policymaking processes may become more
cumbersome,&#8221; Matsui wrote in the Japanese-language report.
&#8220;The most powerful driver for an increase in investment in
Japanese stocks is the yen&#8217;s depreciation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategist raised her rating on communication and
transportation companies to &#8220;overweight&#8221; from &#8220;neutral,&#8221;
citing large cash flows and the possibility of China relaxing
tightening policies. She also recommends retail and real-estate
companies that should be supported by economic measures such as
child-care allowances and tax breaks for home buyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matsui lowered her call on the precision-machinery and
consumer-electronics industries to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from
&#8220;overweight,&#8221; because a slowdown in the U.S. economy may hurt
profits of companies that rely on overseas sales. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The entryway on Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
executive floor is hung with paintings of all the senior
partners since the firm&#8217;s inception,&#8221; says June Breton Fisher.
&#8220;I took a close look and finally asked, &#8216;Where&#8217;s my
grandfather?&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wasn&#8217;t there. No portrait, no photograph, not even a
snapshot recalled Henry Goldman, the founder&#8217;s son whose
financial innovations created the modern banking business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fisher&#8217;s book, &#8220;When Money Was in Fashion: Henry Goldman,
Goldman Sachs, and the Founding of Wall Street&#8221; (Palgrave
Macmillan), creates a vivid portrait of her grandfather, a man
erased from Goldman&#8217;s history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lundborg: What&#8217;s your favorite memory of your grandfather? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fisher: We spent summer vacations as a family at my
grandparents&#8217; home in the Adirondack Mountains. You could see
him in a more relaxed mode, see the fun side of him, like when
he went around in a cape and a crown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lundborg: Did you and he do things together? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fisher: During tennis or croquet tournaments, I&#8217;d sit on
the hill with him. Since he was blind by then, I&#8217;d be the
sportscaster and tell him what was going on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lundborg: By then, he&#8217;d really revolutionized the business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fisher: He was a visionary in business: the progenitor of
the IPO, the P/E ratio, and the Fed, plus he&#8217;d underwritten 56
major corporations that were the building blocks of the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junk From a Cart &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lundborg: Your great-grandfather Marcus, who established
the firm, was even more impressive. He came to this country in
1848 as a poor immigrant and went from selling junk from a
horse-drawn cart in Philadelphia to creating Goldman in New
York. Yet at first, he asked his son-in-law, Sam Sachs, to join
the firm. Not Henry. Why? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fisher: He underestimated Henry, who was not voluble in
conversation. Plus he&#8217;d dropped out of Harvard because of his
bad eyesight &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lundborg: Henry finally joined Goldman in 1885, so what
changed? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fisher: The business had grown so fast, Marcus needed more
help. Henry was not hired at the same level as Sam Sachs, but he
immediately started to make a lot of money as a railroad bond
speculator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His mind was quick and he found a lot of new things to
invest in. To me, what was most remarkable is that he laid out
the plan for issuing preferred and common stock in a company
like United Cigar in one hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lundborg: What precipitated the bitter Goldman vs. Sachs
feud? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pro-German &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fisher: To begin with, it was the total disparity between
Sam and Henry&#8217;s view of World War I. My grandfather was very
pro-German and Mr. Sachs was pro-Ally. They yelled at one
another about that for quite some time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lundborg: Until Henry finally left the company? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fisher: He was angry and weary of all the conflicts, so he
finally cleared out his desk and walked out. He took 15 of the
biggest clients plus his share of the funds in the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&#8217;d been the most important partner, so he&#8217;d accumulated
the most money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lundborg: Why did he love Germany so much? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fisher: My grandfather spent six months of the year in
Germany. He thought the German people were industrious,
innovative in their work habits, and they loved children and
flowers, which was the big line then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lundborg: Hitler helped him change his mind? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fisher: Henry and his wife were in Berlin, where they&#8217;d
always had a wonderful time. Now many of their former friends
wouldn&#8217;t speak to them, they couldn&#8217;t get seats at the opera,
and the ice cream parlor waiter they&#8217;d known for 30 years was
reluctant to serve them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shoved Around &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though he had a white cane, Henry was also shoved
around on the streets. He realized the country had changed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lundborg: What was his response? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fisher: He helped a lot of friends -- artists, writers and
scientists -- get visas and work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lundborg: How did he become an art collector, despite his
bad eyesight? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fisher: He fell in love with paintings, and with the help
of Joseph Duveen, acquired some great ones. His first major
purchase was Rembrandt&#8217;s &#8220;The Apostle Bartholomew,&#8221; when he
could still see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He memorized all the details of each work and only sold the
collection when he knew he was dying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stradivarius &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lundborg: Henry was also a great music lover. For Yehudi Menuhin&#8217;s 12th birthday, he bought him the 1733 Prinz
Khevenhueller Stradivarius violin. How did the relationship come
to end on such a sad note? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fisher: He and Yehudi were very close -- he called him
&#8220;Uncle Henry.&#8221; But his mother was very jealous and didn&#8217;t want
anyone meddling in his life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Henry was bed-ridden, my grandmother wrote to Yehudi
and asked him to come play Beethoven for him one last time. His
mother said &#8220;No way.&#8221; Unbelievably, he was 19 by then and
still obeyed her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lundborg: Goldman Sachs has been making headlines recently,
but this is not the first time the firm has been involved in
such controversy? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fisher: No, Goldman was really pilloried in the 1930s.
Waddill Catchings, the man who was brought in to replace Henry,
was bright, but he was a scoundrel. He put together some
investment trusts that made a lot of money until they crashed.
It was all really just a Ponzi scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lundborg: What do you make of the current situation? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fisher: I find it disappointing. My grandfather and Mr.
Sachs were very ethical, moral businessmen and what they really
wanted to do above all else was preserve the Goldman Sachs name. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc., accused by
the U.S. government of defrauding investors, is generating
better returns for companies and buyers of initial public
offerings than any other Wall Street firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American companies that used New York-based Goldman Sachs
as the lead underwriter for initial sales got the highest prices
for their shares in the first half of 2010, selling at an
average 1.4 percent discount to their offering range, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Buyers were rewarded with an average
first-day advance of 9.6 percent, the biggest this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. IPO market is proving why Goldman Sachs, the most
profitable securities firm in Wall Street&#8217;s history, is still
the bank of choice for companies looking to raise capital and
buyers seeking the biggest returns, finance professors at the
University of Chicago and the University of Notre Dame said.
Offerings led by Credit Suisse Group AG and JPMorgan Chase  Co.
were discounted the most and produced the smallest gains,
Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The issuer and investor care about the opposite things,
and the investment bank is in the middle,&#8221; said Steven Kaplan,
professor of finance at the University of Chicago&#8217;s Booth School
of Business. &#8220;There&#8217;s conflict. Goldman appears to have done
very well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC Charges &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein&#8217;s firm is beating
competitors in an area that generates some of Wall Street&#8217;s
biggest fees. Bankers charged 6.4 percent for underwriting U.S.
IPOs this year, more than 10 times that for mergers and
acquisitions and corporate bonds, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs won the largest share of the $580 million in
fees from initial offerings in the first half, even after the
Securities and Exchange Commission sued the firm in April for
allegedly selling mortgage-related securities that were designed
to fail. The bank has called the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit &#8220;completely
unfounded.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC spokesman John Nester declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was the so-called lead-left underwriter for
11 U.S. IPOs in the first half, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
More than half of those were priced above the middle of the
offering range, while Goldman Sachs-led deals accounted for four
of this year&#8217;s five biggest premiums, the data indicate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies that didn&#8217;t hire the 141-year old firm to lead
their IPOs took an average discount of 14 percent for their
shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-Day Gains &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying initial sales from Goldman Sachs has produced first-
day gains that are more than double the average 3.6 percent for
offerings arranged by other banks, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. In the first month of trading, IPOs led by Morgan Stanley
produced the largest returns, rising 7.8 percent on average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Andrea Rachman, a spokeswoman at Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Financial Engines Inc., the investment adviser co-founded
by Nobel laureate William Sharpe, garnered the largest premium
of any U.S. IPO this year in a March deal led by Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The provider of portfolio-management services to people
with employer-sponsored retirement plans jumped 44 percent in
its first day, the biggest surge this year, after selling shares
at $12 each. The price was 20 percent higher than the Palo Alto,
California-based company had originally asked buyers to pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman is clearly the king investment banker,&#8221; said Tim Loughran, a finance professor at the University of Notre Dame&#8217;s
Mendoza College of Business in Notre Dame, Indiana. &#8220;They&#8217;ve
come under fire, but it doesn&#8217;t matter. If you&#8217;re an issuing
firm, that&#8217;s the first firm you would go to.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla Motors &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the first-day performance of initial sales led by
Goldman Sachs helped buyers reap immediate profits, investors
that held onto the shares have seen the gains diminish. The
advance for the 11 IPOs shrank to 2.5 percent on average over
the first month of trading, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Tesla Motors Inc., the Palo Alto-based maker of the
electric Roadster, erased almost all its 41 percent first-day
surge in the next nine days after the first IPO by an American
car company since 1956. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The automaker run by Elon Musk raised $260 million selling
shares for $17 each, 13 percent higher than the midpoint of its
forecast price range and the third-largest premium for a U.S.
company this year. Tesla&#8217;s stock ended at $18.14 yesterday, 24
percent below its first-day close of $23.89. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;The Credibility&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For the underwriter, first-day success is a very
important measure in terms of certifying the power and the
credibility of the franchise,&#8221; said Josef Schuster, the
Chicago-based founder of IPOX Capital Management LLC, which
oversees $3 billion. &#8220;A good first-day pop certifies the
quality job the underwriter has done with investors and the
company in order to further deals.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schuster, who purchased Tesla shares for his Direxion
Long/Short Global IPO Fund, sold 30 percent of his stake on the
second day of trading as the stock rose as much as 79 percent
from its offering price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some deals arranged by Goldman Sachs have helped private
equity sellers while leaving IPO buyers with losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial offering of Metals USA Holdings Corp., a Fort
Lauderdale, Florida-based metals processor, almost quadrupled
the value for Leon Black&#8217;s New York-based leveraged-buyout firm
Apollo Global Management LLC&#8217;s investment. The shares lost 8.6
percent on the first day and 28 percent after one month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides Financial Engines and Tesla, four other IPOs led by
Goldman Sachs -- Calix Inc. of Petaluma, California, Chicago-
based Accretive Health Inc. and CBOE Holdings Inc., and Higher
One Holdings Inc. in New Haven, Connecticut -- climbed at least
12 percent in their first day of trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, which led IPOs that had an average 7.5
percent first-day gain, completed every deal that it
participated in after marketing began, according to Paul Donahue, the firm&#8217;s co-head of U.S. equity capital markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every other bank had at least one deal that was scuttled,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Americold Realty Trust, the
Atlanta-based warehouse operator owned by Ron Burkle&#8217;s Yucaipa
Cos., postponed what would have been the largest IPO of 2010 in
May after cutting its midpoint price by 33 percent. Goldman
Sachs was hired to lead the IPO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s fair to say that everyone entered 2010 with great
expectations and the market has proven to be trickier than
people would have thought entering the year,&#8221; said Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s Donahue. &#8220;It&#8217;s exactly these types of markets where
we think Morgan Stanley as a franchise has differentiated
itself.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse, JPMorgan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All five U.S. companies that listed Credit Suisse as the
first underwriter took price cuts. The average 21 percent
discount from the original midpoint offer price was the biggest
for any firm&#8217;s deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales arranged by Zurich-based Credit Suisse, Switzerland&#8217;s
second-biggest bank, also left investors with the smallest
first-day returns as four of the five companies rose less than 1
percent. The gains then turned into declines that averaged 7.8
percent in the first month, making it the only bank whose deals
lost money for IPO buyers in the period, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Alimera Sciences Inc., the Alpharetta, Georgia-based
developer of treatments for diseases of the retina, sold its
shares for $11 each after cutting the range from $15 to $17 in
an offering led by Credit Suisse. The stock closed unchanged in
its first day of trading before falling 27 percent in the next
month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Duncan King, a Credit Suisse spokesman, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winning Deals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pricing above or below the range generally reflects
strong or weak demand relative to what was originally
expected,&#8221; said Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the
University of Florida in Gainesville who has studied IPOs for
three decades. &#8220;If an underwriter is consistently pricing below
the range, however, it might mean that it had been aggressive in
suggesting a high valuation in order to win deals.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six of the eight companies that hired New York-based
JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. bank, to lead their IPOs sold
shares at a discount. The average price reduction equaled 20.9
percent, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; AVEO Pharmaceuticals Inc., which is developing a kidney-
cancer treatment, took the biggest cut, reducing its price by 36
percent. The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company sold shares
at $9 each after offering them at $13 to $15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial sales by JPMorgan produced first-day gains of
3.5 percent, less than every bank except for Credit Suisse.
JPMorgan spokeswoman Tasha Pelio declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a balancing act,&#8221; said Lisa Jacobs, a New York-
based partner in the capital markets group at law firm Shearman
 Sterling LLP. &#8220;Lead underwriters are looking for that price
at which both the companies and investors get the benefit of the
bargain and feel they&#8217;ve gotten a good deal. It&#8217;s a fair amount
of science but it&#8217;s also a little bit of art.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp., the oil producer
fighting lawsuits over environmental damage from drilling in
Ecuador, won a request to see outtakes from &#8220;Crude: The Real
Price of Oil,&#8221; a film about oil exploration in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals in New York today ordered
filmmaker Joseph Berlinger to turn over footage not included in
the publicly released version of the movie. Appearing in the so-
called outtakes are lawyers for the plaintiffs in a lawsuit
against Chevron, private and court-appointed experts in the
suit, and current and former Ecuadorian officials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have already seen instances of collusion and fraud on
the part of plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers in portions of Crude that have
been publicly released,&#8221; Justin Higgs, a spokesman for Chevron
said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We are confident that review of
the outtakes will reveal additional instances of misconduct.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron won a lower court ruling in May ordering Berlinger
to surrender outtakes from his documentary about the San Ramon,
California-based company&#8217;s operations in Ecuador. The company
argued that footage shot for the film may be relevant in a
lawsuit brought by Ecuadoreans, in Chevron&#8217;s arbitration against
Ecuador, and in criminal proceedings in the South American
country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower-court judge postponed a Chevron subpoena
requiring Berlinger to surrender his outtakes to allow him to
appeal the ruling. Berlinger&#8217;s lawyer, Maura Wogan, had argued
that rulings against her client will compromise the rights of
other documentary makers protecting their unpublished material. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wogan didn&#8217;t immediately return a call seeking comment
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The district court case is In re Application of Chevron
Corp., M-19-111, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). The appeals court case is Chevron v.
Berlinger, 10-1918, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. agreed to
pay $550 million and change its business practices to settle
U.S. regulatory claims it misled investors in collateralized
debt obligations linked to subprime mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The penalty is the largest ever levied by the Securities
and Exchange Commission against a Wall Street firm, the agency
said in a statement announcing the accord today. Under the deal,
Goldman Sachs acknowledged it made a &#8220;mistake&#8221; and that
marketing materials for the instruments had &#8220;incomplete
information,&#8221; the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Goldman Sachs, the payment amounts to 14 days of
earnings, based on first-quarter results. It&#8217;s the equivalent
of 93 cents a share, said Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford
Bernstein  Co., who had estimated a cost of $1.05. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This appears to be negligence, not fraud,&#8221; Hintz said in
an e-mail, citing the SEC&#8217;s use of words such as &#8220;mistake&#8221; and
&#8220;incomplete information.&#8221; &#8220;Bottom line the SEC and the
administration gets a headline and a &#8216;political win&#8217; and GS gets
an &#8216;economic win.&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs created and sold the CDOs in 2007, as the
U.S. housing market faltered, without disclosing that hedge fund
Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying securities and bet
against the vehicles, the SEC said in an April 16 lawsuit.
Billionaire John Paulson&#8217;s firm earned $1 billion on the trade
and wasn&#8217;t accused of wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;It Was a Mistake&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was a mistake for the Goldman marketing materials to
state that the reference portfolio was &#8216;selected by&#8217; ACA
Management LLC without disclosing the role of Paulson  Co. Inc.
in the portfolio selection process,&#8221; the SEC&#8217;s statement quoted
Goldman Sachs as saying in settlement documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank, based in New York, didn&#8217;t admit or deny
wrongdoing under the accord, the SEC said. The payment includes
a $300 million fine and $250 million as restitution to
investors. IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG, the first German
lender bailed out during the subprime crisis, will receive $150
million, and Royal Bank of Scotland Plc will get $100 million,
the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Goldman Sachs, which closed today at $145.22,
dropped 21 percent since April 15, the day before the suit was
filed, and jumped 4.4 percent today after the SEC said it
planned a &#8220;significant announcement.&#8221; The SP 500 Financial
Index declined 13 percent since the SEC filed suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This takes a cloud off the stock,&#8221; said Peter Sorrentino, senior portfolio manager at Huntington Asset
Advisors in Cincinnati, which manages $13.3 billion including
Goldman Sachs shares. For Goldman Sachs, the settlement means
&#8220;we&#8217;re done, turn the spotlight off, we&#8217;re out of here,&#8221; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fabrice Tourre&#8217;s Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorrentino said his firm may still reduce its holdings in
Goldman Sachs on any price gains because he&#8217;s concerned about
the effect of financial regulatory legislation passed today by
the Senate. Goldman Sachs said the agency doesn&#8217;t &#8216;&#8216;anticipate&#8217;&#8217;
it will bring more claims linked to collateralized debt
obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fabrice Tourre, the only Goldman Sachs worker targeted by
the SEC, remains an employee of the firm and is on leave, said
Lucas van Praag, a company spokesman. The firm promised to
cooperate with the SEC in the case against Tourre and other
&#8220;ongoing litigation,&#8221; the agency&#8217;s deputy enforcement
director, Lorin Reisner, told reporters in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC Enforcement Director Robert Khuzami called the
settlement &#8220;a stark lesson to Wall Street firms that no product
is too complex, and no investor too sophisticated, to avoid a
heavy price if a firm violates the fundamental principles of
honest treatment and fair dealing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wall
Street&#8217;s most profitable securities firm, climbed more than 4
percent amid speculation it will settle U.S. claims that it
defrauded investors. CNBC reported after the market closed that
the firm reached a settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs jumped in New York trading after the
Securities and Exchange Commission said it would make a
&#8220;significant announcement&#8221; at a 4:45 p.m. news conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Times reported that the firm will pay $550
million to settle the claims, without admitting wrongdoing. Of
that, Goldman Sachs will pay $300 million in fines and the rest
will be restitution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If and when a settlement is reached, the pool of
potential investors in Goldman stock will get expanded,&#8221;
Michael Mayo, an analyst at CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets in New
York, wrote in a note to investors today. &#8220;Many that we have
spoken with are prohibited from owning Goldman stock when there
is a threat of criminal action.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs created and sold collateralized debt
obligations linked to subprime mortgages in 2007, as the U.S.
housing market faltered, without disclosing that hedge fund
Paulson  Co. helped picked the underlying securities and bet
against the vehicles, the SEC said in an April 16 lawsuit.
Billionaire John Paulson&#8217;s firm earned $1 billion on the trade
and wasn&#8217;t accused of wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has said the allegations were unfounded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s stock, which closed today at $145.22, has
dropped 21 percent since April 15, the close before the suit was
filed. The SP 500 Financial Index declined 13 percent in the
same period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayo, who predicted last month that a settlement could be
reached as early as July 20, has a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on Goldman
Sachs shares with a target stock price of $207. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps protecting

&lt;p&gt;Five-year contracts on New York-based Goldman declined
about 4 basis points to a mid-price of 167 basis points,
according to data provider CMA. The contracts had been trading
at 177 basis points before CNBC reported the bank had reached a

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, said profit rose 76 percent, buoyed
by a $6.3 billion reduction in provisions for soured mortgages
and credit-card loans from last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second-quarter net income climbed to $4.8 billion, or $1.09
a share, even as revenue fell 7.6 percent, the New York-based
company said today in a statement. The bank earned $2.72
billion, or 28 cents, in the same period a year earlier and
$3.33 billion in the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 54, said he isn&#8217;t
satisfied with the results, even though they surpassed the most
optimistic analyst&#8217;s estimate, because consumer lending charge-
offs and late payments remain high. A 7.6 percent decline in
revenue prompted Shannon Stemm, an analyst for Edward Jones 
Co. in St. Louis, to question whether the profit report masked
weakness in JPMorgan&#8217;s main businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The results beat estimates by so much because of the
large reserve release,&#8221; Stemm said. &#8220;Revenue fell quarter over
quarter and year over year, largely driven by weaker investment-
banking and fixed-income trading results, which were down
because of the volatile trading environment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan rose 11 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $40.46 in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange at 4 p.m. The
stock lost 3.2 percent this year through yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Allen, Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s co-
founder, has pledged to give a majority of his wealth to charity
after his death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allen made the announcement in response to a campaign by
Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
Chairman Warren Buffett to persuade other American billionaires
to donate at least half of their fortunes. Allen said in a
statement that it has been his plan for years to leave the
majority of his estate to philanthropy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allen, 57, has made more than $1 billion in donations,
including $400 million in grants given by the 20-year-old Paul
G. Allen Family Foundation. Allen, who co-founded Microsoft in
1975 and invested in technology companies like Charter
Communications Inc., is the 37th richest man in the world, with
$13.5 billion, according to Forbes magazine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allen in November was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma
and began chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Paul has finished his treatments and as of now has no
current medical issues,&#8221; David Postman, a spokesman for Vulcan
Inc., Allen&#8217;s investment group, said in an e-mail. &#8220;He&#8217;s been
working hard, as he has throughout the year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;St. Louis-based cable operator Charter emerged from
bankruptcy last year. Among Allen&#8217;s other holdings are the
Seattle Seahawks football team and the Portland Trail Blazers
basketball team. Allen also backed a Seattle music and science-
fiction museum, housed in a Frank Gehry-designed building. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett and Gates, two of the world&#8217;s three richest men,
and Gates&#8217; wife, Melinda, started their campaign called &#8220;The
Giving Pledge&#8221; on June 16. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
largest U.S. bank by assets, won dismissal of a lawsuit by a
victim of Bernard L. Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme, claiming the bank
knowingly participated in the fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Barbara S. Jones in New York threw out
the suit filed by MLSMK Investments Co., which said the New
York-based bank in September 2008 investigated Madoff,
determined he was a fraud and liquidated its $250 million
investment in a Madoff-linked fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While it might have been possible for defendants to
determine that Madoff was committing fraud from the &#8216;red flags&#8217;
that plaintiff points out, plaintiff alleges no facts to
demonstrate that defendants actually did make such a
discovery,&#8221; Jones wrote in an opinion released today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MLSMK, a Palm Beach, Florida, partnership, claimed it lost
$12.8 million to Madoff from October to December 2008, the month
he was arrested and charged in history&#8217;s biggest Ponzi scheme.
The case alleged civil racketeering, negligence and bad faith. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We thought we laid out enough of a factual basis, at the
pleading stage, to show that Chase knew at least by September
2008 that Madoff was committing fraud, but continued providing
services that enabled him to continue the fraud,&#8221; said Howard Kleinhendler, a lawyer for MLSMK. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kleinhendler said his client is considering an appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stolen Money &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit, filed in April 2009, claimed MLSMK deposited the
$12.8 million in Madoff&#8217;s Chase account, expecting that the
money would be used to buy and sell securities for its benefit.
Madoff never invested the money and instead stole it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MLSMK claimed that in 2008, when most investors in stocks
were losing money, JPMorgan became suspicious of Madoff&#8217;s
consistently high returns. JPMorgan employees met with Madoff
and did their own investigation of Bernard L. Madoff Investment
Services LLC, MLSMK said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan &#8220;unequivocally concluded that Madoff&#8217;s reported
returns were false and illegitimate&#8221; and &#8220;quietly liquidated&#8221;
its $250 million position in a Madoff-linked fund, MLSMK said.
JPMorgan then decided to &#8220;partner with him in the fleecing of
his victims,&#8221; the firm claimed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan helped Madoff perpetuate his fraud by continuing
to provide banking services and trade with Madoff&#8217;s market-
making business after learning of the fraud, MLSMK claimed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 72, pleaded guilty to fraud and other crimes on
March 12, 2009, and is serving a 150-year prison term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is: MLSMK Investments Co. v. JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
09-CV-4049, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. should return
more capital to investors after buying back $500 million in
shares, according to Charles Peabody, a partner and research
analyst at Portales Partners LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If they have this fortress-type balance sheet with excess
capital and excess loan loss reserves, they should start
returning that to shareholders in various forms,&#8221; Peabody said
today during a radio interview with Tom Keene on Bloomberg
Surveillance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank bought back $135 million of the shares through the
end of the second quarter and the rest this month, Michael Cavanagh, the New York-based company&#8217;s chief executive officer
for Treasury and security services, told journalists on a
conference call today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a start,&#8221; said Peabody, who recommended JPMorgan
buy back more shares or pursue an acquisition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank, said it had $108.2
billion, or 9.6 percent of assets, in Tier 1 regulatory capital,
a core measure of solvency demanded by regulators that includes
common stock and disclosed reserves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quarterly net income increased 76 percent to $4.8 billion,
or $1.09 a share, beating an average estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of analysts for adjusted earnings of 71 cents. Profit
grew even as revenue fell 7.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. banks have been hesitant to return capital to
shareholders following the worst economic crisis since the Great
Depression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon on Dividends &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said today in a
conference call that his preference is to buy back stock rather
than raise the dividend. He said last month that it may be &#8220;too
ambitious&#8221; to expect a dividend increase by the year-end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pushing a dividend increase back until 2011 is &#8220;probably
too long a time to wait,&#8221; Peabody said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the first of the largest U.S. banks to report
earnings. Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc., the first-
and third-largest U.S. lenders, respectively, may report
earnings of $2.6 billion and $1.46 billion when they release
results tomorrow, Bloomberg surveys show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Candover Investments Plc, a London-
based private equity firm, has agreed to sell Belgian diaper-
maker Ontex NV for 1.2 billion euros ($1.55 billion) to TPG Inc.
and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s buyout arm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale &#8220;will help improve the company&#8217;s liquidity at a
time of high volatility in markets and weakness of the euro,&#8221;
Malcolm Fallen, chief executive officer of Candover Investments,
said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candover Partners Ltd. is negotiating to sell itself to
Alberta Investment Management Corp., the Canadian pension fund
manager. Candover shut its 3 billion-euro leveraged buyout fund
in January amid a cash shortage, becoming the British private
equity industry&#8217;s biggest casualty of the credit crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candover&#8217;s acquisition by Alberta may be on the verge of
collapse, the Financial Times reported earlier today, citing
unidentified people familiar with the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candover dropped 7.8 percent to 671 pence in London, giving
the company a market value of 146 million pounds ($224 million). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ontex sales totaled 1.1 billion euros last year, the
company said in a separate statement today. &lt;/p&gt;

because terms aren&#8217;t set. A benchmark sale is typically at least
$500 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is marketing debt after it said second-quarter net
income climbed to $4.8 billion, or $1.09 a share, from $2.72
billion, or 28 cents, in the same period a year earlier. The
per-share earnings compared with an average estimate for
adjusted earnings of 71 cents projected by 22 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s probably some appetite, or as good of appetite as
there&#8217;s been for financials to potentially come to market,&#8221; Tom Murphy, who helps oversee more than $20 billion of investment-
grade credit at Columbus Management in Minneapolis, said in a
telephone interview earlier this week. &#8220;It will be something
very interesting to follow to see if the JPMorgans, the Bank of
Americas, et cetera, decide to do some term-issuance at much
tighter spreads, at much tighter yields.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp., the largest U.S. bank ranked by
assets, is expected to report earnings tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Sale &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan last sold debt on June 17, issuing $1.25 billion
of five-year notes, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
3.4 percent notes priced to yield 3.445 percent, or 145 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data
show. That offering was boosted from $1 billion, the data show.
A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those notes traded yesterday at 101.594 cents on the dollar
to yield 3.049 percent, or 124.1 basis points more than
benchmarks, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is marketing 10-year fixed-rate debt for the first
time since March, when it sold $1.5 billion of the bonds,
Bloomberg data show. The bank will manage today&#8217;s offering, the
person familiar said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
largest U.S. bank by assets, said today the company&#8217;s average
daily risk-taking in commodities fell 9 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value-at-risk in commodity prices, a measure of how much
the firm estimates it might lose in a single day, fell to $20
million in the second quarter from $22 million in the same
quarter last year, the company said. The bank&#8217;s value at risk in
&#8220;commodities and other&#8221; was $15 million in the first quarter
of 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank today reported that profit rose 76 percent, more
than analysts estimated, as a reduction in provisions for soured
mortgages and credit-card loans buoyed results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income climbed to $4.8 billion, or $1.09 a share, from
$2.72 billion, or 28 cents, a year earlier and from $3.33
billion in the first quarter, the New York-based company said
today in a statement. The per-share earnings compared with an
average estimate for adjusted earnings of 71 cents projected by
22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks fell, sending the Dow
Jones Industrial Average lower for the first time in eight days,
after a slowdown in New York-region manufacturing growth and a
report that showed China&#8217;s economic growth is moderating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp., Intel Corp. and 3M Co. led the Dow
lower. JPMorgan Chase  Co., the first of the largest U.S. banks
to post second-quarter results, rose 0.1 percent after earnings
topped estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index declined 0.1 percent to
1,094.29 as of 9:37 a.m. in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average fell 14.38 points, or 0.1 percent, to 10,352.34. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock-index futures pared their advance after a gauge of
New York manufacturing trailed economists&#8217; estimates,
overshadowing a bigger-than-forecast decrease in jobless claims.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York&#8217;s general economic index
dropped to 5.1, lower than the median forecast of 18 in a
Bloomberg News survey of economists. Readings greater than zero
signal expansion in the so-called Empire State Index that covers
New York, northern New Jersey and southern Connecticut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial jobless claims dropped by 29,000 to 429,000 in the
week ended July 10, the fewest since August 2008, the Labor
Department said. The government anticipates an increase in
temporary factory layoffs in early July that did not occur this
year, leading to the decrease in applications, a Labor
Department spokesman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rally Falters &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks halted a six-day rally yesterday after Intel
Corp.&#8217;s record profit forecast was overshadowed by a drop in
retail sales and the Federal Reserve&#8217;s assessment that the
economy has &#8220;softened.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmark SP 500 rebounded more than 7 percent from a
10-month low on July 2 through yesterday amid optimism about
second-quarter results. Analysts predict earnings in the SP 500
grew 34 percent last quarter, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan climbed 0.1 percent to $40.39. The U.S. bank
posted a 76 percent rise in second-quarter profit to $4.8
billion, or $1.09 a share, beating an average estimate for
adjusted earnings of 71 cents, according to a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it bought back $500 million in shares through
yesterday after receiving approval from regulators to return
some capital to shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank, said it bought back $500 million in shares
through yesterday after receiving approval from regulators to
return some capital to shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan bought back $135 million through the end of the
second quarter and the rest of the shares this month,
Michael Cavanagh, the New York-based company&#8217;s chief executive
officer for Treasury and Security Services, told journalists on
a conference call today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You can assume that we don&#8217;t do that without consulting
with our regulators,&#8221; Cavanagh told reporters on a conference
call after the company reported a 76 percent increase in net
income to $4.8 billion for the second quarter. &#8220;It&#8217;s a small
amount of buyback activity and I wouldn&#8217;t draw too many
conclusions from that other than yes, in fact, it&#8217;s been a while
and we&#8217;re back with some degree of activity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. banks, which were directed to raise capital and
restrict dividends following the worst economic crisis since the
Great Depression, have been hesitant to return that money to
shareholders. Dimon said last month that it may be &#8220;too
ambitious&#8221; to expect a dividend increase by the end of the
year. Share repurchases may come first because they don&#8217;t have
to be sustained like a dividend boost. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. former
computer programmer Sergey Aleynikov said a judge should dismiss
charges he stole trading software from the bank because the acts
described by U.S. prosecutors don&#8217;t constitute crimes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov, 40, was arrested last July and indicted Feb. 11
in what a prosecutor called the &#8220;most substantial&#8221; theft New
York-based Goldman could recall. The programmer stole a code for
Goldman&#8217;s high-frequency trading business on his last day at the
bank in June 2009, prosecutors said in the indictment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The acts of which Aleynikov stands accused -- copying,
transporting and accessing proprietary computer source code for
an investment bank&#8217;s high-frequency trading business -- do not
constitute the federal crimes for which he was indicted,&#8221; Kevin Marino, Aleynikov&#8217;s lawyer, said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is charged with theft of trade secrets, transportation
of stolen property in foreign commerce and unauthorized computer
access. He faces as long as 25 years in prison if convicted.
Aleynikov pleaded not guilty to the charges. U.S. District Judge
Denise L. Cote in New York, who is presiding over the case, set
a Nov. 29 trial date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov, who started at Goldman in May 2007, left on June
5, 2009. That day he transferred &#8220;hundreds of thousands of
lines of source code for Goldman&#8217;s high-frequency trading system
from its computer network&#8221; to an outside server in Germany,
according to the indictment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading Platform &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That trading platform isn&#8217;t &#8220;a product that is produced
for or placed in interstate or foreign commerce&#8221; as described
by the statute, according to Aleynikov. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The allegedly stolen code didn&#8217;t constitute &#8220;goods, wares,
merchandise, securities or money&#8221; as defined by federal law,
Marino said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The statute is obviously designed to criminalize the act
of stealing a trade secret embodied in a product that is
produced for, if not actually placed in the stream of
commerce,&#8221; Marino said. &#8220;Goldman&#8217;s high-frequency trading
platform does not meet that description by anyone&#8217;s lights.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice Oh, a spokeswoman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, had no comment. She said prosecutors are expected to
file a reply by July 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Aleynikov, 1:10-cr-00096, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks slid, wiping out a
weekly advance, as revenue at Bank of America Corp., Citigroup
Inc. and General Electric Co. missed analyst estimates and a
gauge of consumer confidence slid to the lowest in a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America tumbled 9.2 percent, the most since June
2009, while Citigroup retreated 6.3 percent and GE lost 4.6
percent. Google Inc. sank 7 percent after earnings trailed the
average analyst estimate following a surge in spending. Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., the most profitable firm in Wall Street
history, rallied 0.7 percent after agreeing to pay $550 million
and change its business practices to settle federal government
claims it misled investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index dropped 2.9 percent to
1,064.88 at 4 p.m. in New York, the biggest drop this month. It
fell 1.2 percent this week, erasing its gain after the Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment fell
more than economists estimated. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
lost 261.41 points, or 2.5 percent, to 10,097.90 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Companies have been exceeding or meeting earnings
expectations on cost cuts, not on demand for their products and
services,&#8221; said Terry Morris, who manages $2 billion at
National Penn Investors Trust Co. in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania.
&#8220;I think the market is pricing in more than we&#8217;re going to
see&#8221; in the way of revenue growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beating Estimates &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 climbed 7.2 percent from July 2 through
yesterday amid optimism that corporate earnings would signal the
economic recovery is sustainable. SP 500 companies are
projected to increase profits by 34 percent in 2010 and 18
percent in 2011, the fastest two-year gain since 1995, according
to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Of the 23 companies
in the SP 500 that reported since July 12, all but three have
topped forecasts for earnings-per-share, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue for the group that has reported so far has
increased 2.6 percent, with 17 of 23 companies beating analyst
estimates, according to the data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, the largest U.S. bank by assets, slid 9.2
percent to $13.98 to lead financial companies to the biggest
decline among 10 industry groups in the SP 500. Citigroup, the
third-biggest, retreated 6.3 percent to $3.90. GE, the world&#8217;s
largest maker of jet engines and power-plant turbines, fell 4.6
percent to $14.55. The three companies beat analyst estimates
for per-share earnings while missing on sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Revenue is more of a challenge when the economy&#8217;s not
growing very fast,&#8221; said Robert Lutts, president of Cabot Money
Management in Salem, Massachusetts, which oversees $500 million.
&#8220;I&#8217;m more impressed that there&#8217;s been no real extreme negative
future guidance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standard  Poor&#8217;s changed its team
of analysts covering Wall Street firms, almost two years after
the credit crisis led to government bailouts and downgrades for
companies including Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craig Parmelee, previously a managing director covering the
gaming industry and rival Moody&#8217;s Corp., took over last month as
head of North American financial institutions analysis,
according to a memo from Jay Dhru, the group&#8217;s global head. He
replaced Rodrigo Quintanilla, who became head researcher within
Parmelee&#8217;s group, according to the memo, confirmed by SP
spokesman Jeff Sexton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley all had SP
ratings of A+ or better in mid-2008, months before they took a
combined $65 billion in bailout funds in a government effort to
bolster confidence in the financial system. In March, SP said
it would review bank ratings to gauge whether they properly
account for the risks of funding runs and the potential for
future government bailouts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Standard  Poor&#8217;s is consistently looking at how we can
improve the quality of our credit ratings,&#8221; the New York-based
McGraw-Hill Cos. unit said in an e-mailed statement yesterday,
responding to a query about the changes. &#8220;This includes
providing opportunities for our staff to pursue new
opportunities within our organization that will help broaden
their skill set and increase the perspective and approach they
bring to their day-to-day roles.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprinzen&#8217;s Shift &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among those who shifted was Scott Sprinzen, who published
an A rating on Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. on Sept. 12, 2008,
three days before the U.S. securities firm filed the biggest
bankruptcy in U.S. history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprinzen, the lead analyst for Citigroup, Goldman Sachs,
JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley, decided to move to the SP division
that handles ratings on non-financial industries, Dhru wrote in
his note. Those include energy, aerospace, media, machinery,
retailing, health care, transportation and utilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprinzen has been &#8220;skillfully rating financial
institutions through a very challenging time,&#8221; Dhru wrote in
the memo. &#8220;He will continue to coordinate with the team during
the transition phase.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the statement, SP said ratings decisions are made by
committee and do not represent &#8220;the actions of an individual
credit analyst.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vandana Sharma, previously lead analyst on mortgage-finance
company Freddie Mac, took over in late June as lead analyst for
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Stuart Plesser, who was the
backup analyst on State Street Corp. and previously worked as an
equity analyst at SP covering regional banks and mortgage
lenders, is now lead analyst for JPMorgan Chase  Co. and
Citigroup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azarchs Retires &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tanya Azarchs, who was head researcher in the North
American financial-institutions group and served as lead analyst
for Wells Fargo  Co. and U.S. Bancorp, retired last month after
28 years with SP, according to Dhru&#8217;s memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Tanya has made significant contributions to the FI Group
and we will miss her wisdom, energy and deep understanding of
the financial markets,&#8221; Dhru wrote. Sharma took over coverage
of Wells Fargo, and Plesser is handling U.S. Bancorp, Sexton
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Bartko continues to cover Bank of America Corp., the
biggest U.S. bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parmelee joined SP as an analyst in 1998, according to a
biography provided by Sexton. Previously he worked in the
banking industry for almost 10 years, and was a vice president
at State Street lending to medium-size companies, according to
the bio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The personnel moves &#8220;should not result in a change to a
credit rating,&#8221; according to the statement from SP. Sharma and
Plesser issued statements this week saying that second-quarter
earnings results from Citigroup, JPMorgan and Bank of America
wouldn&#8217;t result in an immediate change in ratings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The review announced in March of bank-rating criteria &#8220;is
ongoing and a definitive timetable has not been set,&#8221; SP said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hartford Financial Services Group
Inc. was the biggest buyer among U.S. insurers of the 2007
Fannie Mae securities offerings that were cited in a lawsuit
against Goldman Sachs Group Inc., SNL Financial said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hartford wrote off its $211.1 million investment in Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s sales of Fannie preferred stock in September 2007 and
December 2007, Tim Zawacki, an analyst with SNL, said today in a
report. As a group, insurers spent $1.04 billion on the
securities and reported losses of $802 million, SNL said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hartford was caught off guard by the 2008 financial crisis
and needed a $3.4 billion U.S. bailout after investments soured.
The insurer&#8217;s losses on the Fannie Mae securities were more than
three times those of rival Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., the
Boston-based carrier that sued Goldman Sachs last week and said
the bank misled investors in the offering. In 2008, Fannie Mae
was taken over by the U.S. amid losses on home loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman Sachs knew or recklessly disregarded the actual
status of Fannie Mae&#8217;s capital structure,&#8221; Liberty Mutual said
in the complaint. The insurer said it invested about $62.5
million and that the stake became &#8220;virtually worthless.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shannon Lapierre, a spokeswoman for Hartford, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a call. Hartford, based in the Connecticut
city of the same name, repaid its government aid in March. Chief
Executive Officer Liam McGee, who returned the insurer to
profitability after taking over in 2009, said in an interview
last month that the company is relying more on its own
underwriting before buying securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allstate, CNA &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs had said the offering was for surplus capital
when it was actually needed to help Fannie Mae sustain its
business, Liberty Mutual said in its July 8 complaint in Boston
federal court. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based
Goldman Sachs, said last week that the suit was without merit
&#8220;and we will contest it vigorously.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurers that invested in the offering lost varying
portions of their capital, depending on whether they sold the
securities and when. Allstate Corp., the biggest publicly traded
home and auto insurer, lost $30.9 million of its $70.3 million
investment in the December 2007 sale, while CNA Financial Corp.
lost $44.4 million of the $46 million it spent in the September
offering, according to SNL. NYMAGIC Inc. made a profit of
$400,000 on a $20 million investment in the December sale,
according to Zawacki&#8217;s research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maryellen Thielen, a spokeswoman for Allstate, and Katrina Parker, a spokeswoman for CNA, had no immediate comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Significant Problems&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has come under fire from Congress and
regulators for its underwriting and investments as mortgage
markets collapsed during the credit crisis. The New York-based
bank, Wall Street&#8217;s most profitable, agreed yesterday to pay
$550 million to settle a lawsuit by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission that claimed it sold a collateralized debt
obligation without disclosing that a hedge fund helped pick
underlying securities and bet against the vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time that it was underwriting the Fannie Mae
offering, Goldman was aware that there were &#8220;significant
problems&#8221; in the real estate market and bet its own money
against subprime-mortgage-related securities, Liberty Mutual
said in the complaint, which drew on documents collected by the
U.S. Senate&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Ryan J. Donmoyer" date="Jul 16, 2010  2:02 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-07-16/goldman-waives-tax-deduction-on-sec-settlement.html"><headline>Goldman Waives Tax Deduction on SEC Settlement</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. agreed to
waive tax deductions it could have claimed after paying a $550
million penalty in a settlement with U.S. regulators, giving up
as much as $187.5 million in savings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In yesterday&#8217;s settlement with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission, the firm agreed &#8220;it shall not claim,
assert or apply for a tax deduction&#8221; for any penalty amounts.
Goldman Sachs will pay a $535 million civil penalty, which
normally would be deductible, and give up $15 million in
profits, which the firm likely can still deduct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s unusual, but not unheard of&#8221; for companies to forgo
tax deductions when negotiating settlements, said Robert Willens, founder of Robert Willens LLC, a consulting firm that
advises investors on tax and accounting rules. &#8220;It&#8217;s actually
become a little more popular in recent years for the government
to insist that no deduction be taken for any portion of the
payment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to deduct the payments, Goldman Sachs would have
had to argue that a portion were compensatory and would be paid
to third parties rather than the government. Other companies
have argued that position, said Ron Pearlman, a tax law
professor at Georgetown University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explicit Prohibition &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement explicitly bars the company from claiming
deductions &#8220;regardless of whether such penalty amounts, or any
part thereof, are added to a distribution fund or otherwise used
for the benefit of investors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Goldman Sach&#8217;s case, Pearlman said, the company &#8220;likely
concluded that it would not be good PR if it became known, as it
undoubtedly would, that Goldman Sachs attempted to deduct the
penalty.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving up the tax deduction makes the penalty appear
smaller than paying a larger penalty and retaining the
deductions. Had Goldman Sachs agreed to a $1 billion fine and
kept its federal and state deductions, the net outlay would have
been about $600 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the settlement, Goldman Sachs acknowledged that
marketing materials for a 2007 deal at the center of the case
contained &#8220;incomplete information.&#8221; The SEC&#8217;s suit filed in
April accused the firm of defrauding investors in a mortgage-
backed collateralized debt obligation by failing to tell them
that hedge fund Paulson  Co., which was planning to bet against
the deal, had helped design it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects number of units sold in sixth paragraph of story
that ran yesterday.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. sales of video games fell 6
percent in June to $1.1 billion after the strong appeal of
Nintendo Co., Sony Corp. and Microsoft Corp. consoles failed to
offset weak game purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox 360 sales gained 88 percent to 451,700
units after it introduced a slimmer version of its console with
a larger hard drive. It was the second-largest non-holiday month
of sales for the Redmond, Washington-based company&#8217;s Xbox 360,
behind the September 2007 release of the game Halo 3, research
firm NPD Group said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nintendo sold 422,500 Wii consoles in the U.S. in June, a
16 percent increase from a year earlier, NPD said. Sales of
Tokyo-based Sony&#8217;s PlayStation 3 jumped 85 percent to 304,800
units in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nintendo&#8217;s DS handheld video-game player sales fell by a
third after the Kyoto, Japan-based company said it&#8217;s introducing
a version equipped with three cameras, a wireless connection and
a screen that displays 3-D images without the use of special
glasses. The company plans to start selling the 3DS player
before March 2011, prompting a 39 percent decline in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games sales fell 15 percent to $531 million, hurt by a
relatively weak lineup of large-franchise titles as game
publishers hold major releases for the second half of the year,
which historically delivers higher sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red Dead Redemption, from New York-based Take-Two
Interactive Software Inc., remained the top-selling video game
for a second month, with 963,000 units purchased for Xbox 360
and PS3, NPD said. Nintendo&#8217;s Super Mario Galaxy 2 sold 548,000
units for the Wii. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sales are more concentrated this year on the top-selling
games,&#8221; NPD analyst Anita Frazier said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European stocks retreated for a
third day, led by a selloff in banks, after Citigroup Inc. and
Bank of America Corp. reported revenue that missed analysts&#8217;
estimates and U.S. consumer confidence fell more than forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc, Credit Agricole SA and Credit Suisse Group AG
declined more than 2.5 percent. RWE AG and E.ON AG led utilities
lower after Germany proposed a tax on nuclear power plants.
Roche Holding AG sank 4.2 percent as U.S. regulators said the
drugmaker&#8217;s top-seller Avastin didn&#8217;t slow breast tumors in new
studies as much as in earlier tests used to win approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped 1.9 percent to 248.11,
erasing the measure&#8217;s gains for the week even as company
earnings from Alcoa Inc. to Intel Corp. beat estimates. The
gauge has fallen 8.8 percent from this year&#8217;s high on April 15
amid concern that the global economic recovery is losing steam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is nervousness around,&#8221; said Bill Dinning, head of
strategy at Aegon NV&#8217;s Edinburgh-based fund management unit.
&#8220;Investors are concerned that even with good earnings from Q2
there are still question marks out there. Clearly we have
started to see some slowing in the economy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National benchmark indexes fell in all of the 18 western
European markets, except Greece, with stocks extending losses
after the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
index of U.S. consumer sentiment for July slid to the lowest
level in a year. Germany&#8217;s DAX lost 1.8 percent, France&#8217;s CAC 40
sank 2.3 percent and the U.K.&#8217;s FTSE 100 slid 1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Earnings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European stocks earlier swung between gains and losses as
U.S. companies from General Electric Co. to Bank of America and
Citigroup reported second-quarter results. All three companies
beat estimates for per-share earnings while missing on sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays, the U.K.&#8217;s third-largest bank, declined 5.2
percent to 284.65 pence. Credit Agricole, France&#8217;s biggest bank
by branches, slid 3.8 percent to 8.93 euros and Switzerland&#8217;s
Credit Suisse dropped 2.7 percent to 43.03 Swiss francs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A measure of European banks posted the biggest drop among
the 19 industry groups in the Stoxx 600, even as Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. agreed to pay $550 million and change its business
practices to settle a U.S. fraud lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utility shares recorded the third-largest slide on the
regional benchmark gauge, with RWE plunging 4.3 percent to 52.33
euros and E.ON sinking 4.9 percent to 21.78 euros. The German
government is proposing a tax on nuclear power plants that
applies each time a reactor receives new fuel rods designed to
generate 2.3 billion euros ($3 billion) of revenue a year,
Finance Ministry spokesman Michael Offer told reporters in
Berlin today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortum, Roche &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortum Oyj dropped 5.5 percent to 18.05 euros after the
Nordic region&#8217;s second-largest utility reported second-quarter
net income of 263 million euros. That missed the average analyst
estimate of 285 million euros, according to a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roche led pharmaceutical shares lower, falling 4.2 percent
to 144.5 francs. Avastin paired with chemotherapy treatments
didn&#8217;t help patients survive longer than use of the other drugs
alone, according to a U.S. Food and Drug Administration staff
review. FDA advisers will meet July 20 to evaluate the drug and
consider whether use in breast cancer should be continued,
expanded or halted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elan Corp. lost 2.3 percent to 3.85 euros after the Irish
drugmaker said it expects to pay $203.5 million to settle U.S.
government charges linked to the sale and marketing of the
Zonegran epilepsy treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Gains &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc which has been battling to contain the worst U.S.
oil spill in history, advanced 1.3 percent to 407.15 pence. The
company said it&#8217;s &#8220;encouraged&#8221; after a pressure test that
halted the flow from its Gulf of Mexico well indicated no sign
of an oil leak after the first 17 hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, BP may reach an agreement as soon as next week
to sell assets including half its stake in Alaska&#8217;s Prudhoe Bay
field to Apache Corp. for $10 billion to $11 billion, according
to two people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yara International ASA climbed 5.2 percent to 222.5 kroner
after the largest publicly traded nitrogen-fertilizer maker said
second-quarter net income was 3.72 billion kroner ($600
million), beating an analyst estimate of 3.61 billion kroner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rival K+S AG, Europe&#8217;s biggest potash producer, gained 2.6
percent to 38.90 euros.
     Rautaruukki Oyj jumped 8.6 percent to 14.33 euros after
raising its 2010 sales forecast, saying revenue will grow 25
percent to 30 percent over last year. The previous target was
for 15 percent to 30 percent growth. Rautaruukki said it also
expects to post a pretax profit this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc will
reserve the right to file future lawsuits against Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. after the Wall Street firm agreed to pay $100 million
in compensation as part of a settlement with U.S. regulators, a
person with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBS hasn&#8217;t been asked to waive its right to file lawsuits
and has a strong legal case following New York-based Goldman&#8217;s
agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to pay a
$550 million fine, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the talks are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBS, which was bailed out by the British taxpayer, lost
about $841 million on a collateralized debt obligation arranged
by Goldman Sachs. U.S. authorities sued Goldman in April,
alleging that the bank created and sold CDOs linked to subprime
mortgages without disclosing to buyers that hedge fund Paulson 
Co. helped pick the underlying securities and bet against them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;RBS has been monitoring the complaint closely,&#8221; the
Edinburgh-based bank said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;Following
the SEC&#8217;s announcement, RBS will now carefully consider all of
its options.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany&#8217;s IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG will receive about
$150 million payment as part of the settlement after it lost
about the same amount on the Goldman Sachs CDO. KfW Group, the
German development bank that bailed out IKB during the credit
crisis, said it will also review the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Examining the Decision&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;KfW is examining the decision from last night,&#8221;
spokesman Michael Helbig said today, declining to comment
further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rhineland Funding, IKB&#8217;s former investment vehicle,
invested in the Goldman securities. Rhineland Funding ran out of
money amid the credit crunch in 2007, forcing KfW to assume 8.1
billion euros of IKB&#8217;s financing obligations to prevent the
lender&#8217;s collapse, IKB spokesman Patrick von der Ehe said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the terms of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s settlement with the SEC,
the firm is prohibited from denying, directly or indirectly, any
of the allegations in the SEC&#8217;s complaint. The complaint, which
was filed on April 16, accused Goldman Sachs of intentionally
misleading investors in the Abacus CDO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm &#8220;is acknowledging that its marketing materials
were deficient and failed to disclose material information,&#8221;
Lorin Reisner, the SEC&#8217;s enforcement director, said yesterday.
Goldman yesterday agreed to pay $550 million and change its
business practices to settle U.S. regulatory claims. The penalty
is the largest levied by the Securities and Exchange Commission
against a Wall Street firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs spokeswoman in London declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A U.K. investigation of Goldman Sachs by the U.K. Financial
Services Authority is &#8220;ongoing,&#8221; said Toby Parker, a spokesman
for the regulator in London. The FSA said in April that it would
review &#8220;any implications for the U.K.-regulated entities of
Goldman Sachs&#8221; after the Prime Minister Gordon Brown called for
a probe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. agreed to
pay $550 million and change its business practices to settle
U.S. regulatory claims it misled investors in collateralized
debt obligations linked to subprime mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The penalty is the largest ever levied by the Securities
and Exchange Commission against a Wall Street firm, the agency
said in a statement announcing the accord yesterday. Under the
deal, Goldman Sachs acknowledged it made a &#8220;mistake&#8221; and that
marketing materials for the instruments had &#8220;incomplete
information,&#8221; the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This settlement is a stark lesson to Wall Street firms
that no product is too complex, and no investor too
sophisticated, to avoid a heavy price if a firm violates the
fundamental principles of honest treatment and fair dealing,&#8221;
SEC Enforcement Director Robert Khuzami said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs created and sold the CDOs in 2007, as the
U.S. housing market faltered, without disclosing that hedge fund
Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying securities and bet
against the vehicles, the SEC said in an April 16 lawsuit.
Billionaire John Paulson&#8217;s firm earned $1 billion on the trade
and wasn&#8217;t accused of wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was a mistake for the Goldman marketing materials to
state that the reference portfolio was &#8216;selected by&#8217; ACA
Management LLC without disclosing the role of Paulson  Co. Inc.
in the portfolio selection process,&#8221; the SEC&#8217;s statement quoted
Goldman Sachs as saying in settlement documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank, based in New York, didn&#8217;t admit or deny
wrongdoing under the accord, the SEC said. The payment includes
a $300 million fine and $250 million as restitution to
investors. The settlement is subject to a judge&#8217;s approval. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefighters Flooded Rig, Caused Oil Spill, Suit Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst oil spill in U.S. history was triggered by
firefighting boats that flooded the Deepwater Horizon drilling
rig with water, causing it to sink into the Gulf of Mexico and
damage BP Plc&#8217;s well, a lawsuit claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commercial fishermen, waterfront property owners and oil
industry workers who have lost jobs because of the oil spill
yesterday sued 17 companies whose fireboats responded to the
explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon on April 20. The rig was
still attached to the subsea well when it sank two days later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was the flooding of the Deepwater Horizon and the
resulting sinking of the rig that directly caused the piping to
break and begin spewing millions of gallons of oil into the
ocean,&#8221; Lloyd Frischhertz and Gerald Maples, lawyers for the
spill victims, said in a complaint filed in federal court in New
Orleans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit doesn&#8217;t seek damages from BP, rig-owner
Transocean Ltd. or the U.S. Coast Guard, which helped direct the
firefighting effort. The plaintiffs claim the fireboats violated
industry standard procedures that warn against using water
cannons to attack pressurized oil fires aboard marine vessels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Any request or encouragement by U.S. Coast Guard, British
Petroleum or Transocean to pump water and use water cannons&#8221;
for extended periods to fight the fire &#8220;should have been met
with protest and refusal,&#8221; according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many as eight fireboats each shot &#8220;10,000 to 50,000
gallons of seawater on the rig per minute,&#8221; according to the
complaint. They flooded the rig&#8217;s upper compartments and
destabilized it, causing it to tip over and sink, the plaintiffs
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molly Hottinger, a spokeswoman for Seacor Holdings Inc.,
parent of defendant Seacor Marine, declined to comment. Les Van
Dyke, a spokesman for Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc., a unit of
which is also a defendant in the suit, didn&#8217;t immediately return
a call for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Robin v. Seacor Marine LLC, 2:10-cv-01986, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countrywide &#8216;Disregarded&#8217; Guidelines, Lawsuit Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countrywide Financial Corp., the mortgage lender acquired
by Bank of America Corp., systemically disregarded lending
guidelines in the loans it underwrote, according to a revised
lawsuit by investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documents for mortgages originated by Countrywide and later
securitized contained misrepresentations and omissions, and
didn&#8217;t follow the lender&#8217;s own guidelines, the investors said in
the 146-page complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Despite assurances by the defendants in the offering
documents that mortgage loans collateralizing the certificates
were originated pursuant to stated guidelines, nothing could
have been further from the truth,&#8221; the plaintiffs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint, which seeks group status on behalf of
investors who claim to have purchased $351 billion of mortgage-
backed securities, was filed yesterday. A copy was posted on a
website by lawyers representing the plaintiffs and couldn&#8217;t be
independently verified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit, which alleges violations of federal securities
laws, was first filed in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shirley Norton, a Bank of America spokeswoman, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Maine State Retirement System v. Countrywide,
10-cv-00302, U.S. District Court, Central District of California
(Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BP Suits Top 300 on Claims by Workers, Mall, Sheriff &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc faces more than 300 lawsuits seeking billions of
dollars in potential claims as damage from the worst oil spill
in U.S. history ripples through the nation&#8217;s Gulf Coast economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A regional shopping mall in southern Louisiana sued July 12
in New Orleans federal court over the loss of customers, a
parish sheriff filed suit there July 9 to recover lost business
tax revenue, and growing numbers of BP employees and investors
lodged claims over alleged corporate mismanagement that caused
BP&#8217;s share price to fall by half. The complaints surpassed 300
July 14, according to court records compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These lawsuits join scores of proposed class actions filed
by commercial fishing companies, beach-front property owners,
restaurant owners and environmentalists claiming harm from the
drifting oil. Legal experts said the number of suits will
continue to rise after the damaged well has stopped gushing oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are more than 100,000 individual damage claims
filed in the BP claims process, so we&#8217;ll probably see a multiple
of that number of court cases before it&#8217;s all said and done,&#8221;
Houston attorney Brent Coon said yesterday in a telephone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coon said he&#8217;s filed &#8220;very few&#8221; lawsuits so far on behalf
of the 100 spill-related clients he represents, because he&#8217;s
waiting to see whether London-based BP pays claims from the $20
billion fund the company created for that purpose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Salt, a spokesman for BP, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimates of BP&#8217;s ultimate payout over the spill are rising
along with the number of lawsuits. Analysts in May estimated
costs of judgments and claims wouldn&#8217;t exceed $20 billion. A
June 2 Credit Suisse report assessed BP&#8217;s liabilities at $37
billion in cleanup and potential litigation expenses. Three
weeks later, oil analyst Fadel Gheit, at Oppenheimer  Co., put
the financial hit from the Deepwater Horizon rig disaster as
high as $60 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers will ask a panel of federal judges in Boise, Idaho,
on July 29 to consolidate the cases into two multidistrict
litigations, or MDLs, to streamline pretrial rulings, evidence-
gathering and organization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One MDL would cover economic loss and environmental damage
claims in a dozen states. Most of these cases also name as
defendants Transocean Ltd., Halliburton Energy Services, Cameron
International Corp. and Anadarko Petroleum, all of whom
allegedly played a role in the spill. BP has asked the Boise
panel to consolidate the cases in federal court in Houston,
while attorneys for multiple plaintiffs are seeking assignment
to New Orleans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other MDL will cover lawsuits by investors in BP U.S.
shares who claim the company&#8217;s officers failed to disclose
safety problems, artificially inflating stock value, or that
management failures led to the spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;BP&#8217;s procedures for minimizing its financial losses from
drilling rig problems were no more than fantasies,&#8221; according
to a complaint in a shareholder class action filed in Lafayette,
Louisiana. &#8220;BP was simply not the enterprise that its public
communications pictured.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Wins Dismissal of Madoff Fraud Victim&#8217;s Lawsuit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-largest U.S. bank by
assets, won dismissal of a lawsuit by a victim of Bernard L.
Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme claiming the bank knowingly participated
in the fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Barbara S. Jones in New York yesterday
threw out a suit filed by MLSMK Investments Co., which said the
New York-based bank in September 2008 investigated Madoff,
determined he was a fraud and liquidated its $250 million
investment in a Madoff-linked fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While it might have been possible for defendants to
determine that Madoff was committing fraud from the &#8216;red flags&#8217;
that plaintiff points out, plaintiff alleges no facts to
demonstrate that defendants actually did make such a
discovery,&#8221; Jones wrote in an opinion released yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MLSMK, a Palm Beach, Florida, partnership, claimed it lost
$12.8 million to Madoff from October to December 2008, the month
Madoff was arrested and charged in history&#8217;s biggest Ponzi
scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We thought we laid out enough of a factual basis, at the
pleading stage, to show that Chase knew at least by September
2008 that Madoff was committing fraud, but continued providing
services that enabled him to continue the fraud,&#8221; said Howard
Kleinhendler, a lawyer for MLSMK. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kleinhendler said his client is considering an appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is MLSMK Investments Co. v. JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
09-cv-04049, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conrad Black Not Entitled to Bail, U.S. Tells Appeals Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conrad Black, the imprisoned ex-Hollinger International
Inc. chief executive officer found guilty of fraud and
obstructing justice, isn&#8217;t entitled to bail as an appeals court
reviews his conviction, prosecutors argued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black, 65, last week asked the U.S. Court of Appeals in
Chicago to free him while it reviews his conviction in light of
last month&#8217;s Supreme Court ruling that narrowed the scope of a
federal law making it a crime to deprive someone of the right to
&#8220;honest services.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government said yesterday in court papers that Black&#8217;s
trial jury had proof that the former CEO committed fraud
involving money, not just the deprivation of honest-services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors &#8220;presented the honest-services fraud theory to
the jury based on the same fraudulent conduct that supported the
money-fraud theory,&#8221; the Justice Department told the court. The
jury had sufficient evidence to convict either way, they said.
Black shouldn&#8217;t be freed because he&#8217;s unlikely to win the
appeal, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The honest-services fraud law was used to prosecute
corporate officers and public officials who the government said
had cheated shareholders and taxpayers. Ex-Illinois Governor Rod
Blagojevich is facing honest-services fraud charges in a
criminal trial in the U.S. courthouse where Black was convicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black and former Enron Corp. CEO Jeffrey Skilling were
convicted after trials based in part on that charge. Since March
2008, Black has been serving a 6 1/2-year sentence at a federal
prison in Coleman, Florida. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Supreme Court has now unanimously ruled that a
violation affecting Mr. Black&#8217;s Sixth Amendment jury trial right
occurred,&#8221; wrote defense attorney Miguel A. Estrada of the
Washington office of Los Angeles-based Gibson Dunn  Crutcher
LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estrada told the court Black&#8217;s conviction must be set aside
unless the court is certain the jury&#8217;s verdict couldn&#8217;t be
attributed to instructions they received from the trial judge on
the honest-services law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black and three associates were found guilty in the theft
of $6.1 million from Hollinger International as they engineered
its sale of assets. The company was once the world&#8217;s third-
largest publisher of English-language newspapers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Black, 07-4080, U.S. Seventh Circuit
Court of Appeals (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swiss Lawyer Indicted for Conspiring With HSBC Client &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Swiss lawyer was indicted on U.S. charges that he helped
a Virginia surgeon use an HSBC Holding Plc account to hide
assets from the Internal Revenue Service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Felix Mathis, a Zurich-based attorney at Froriep Renggli
LLP, is alleged to have used a sham Liechtenstein trust to
conceal assets that the surgeon, Andrew Silva, held at HSBC. The
federal grand jury in Virginia also accused Mathis in two
&#8220;structuring&#8221; counts of helping Silva secretly import $235,000
into the U.S. without reporting it to the government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silva was sentenced on June 11 to two years of probation
after pleading guilty to conspiring with a Swiss banker and a
Zurich attorney to defraud the IRS. As part of his guilty plea,
Silva, who is cooperating with prosecutors, implicated Mathis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department is also conducting a criminal
investigation of HSBC clients who may have failed inform the IRS
of accounts in India or Singapore, according to three people
familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A call to Mathis&#8217;s office in Zurich after business hours
wasn&#8217;t returned. He faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silva in 1997 inherited from his mother a bank account held
at the Zurich branch of an &#8220;international bank&#8221; in the name of
the Liechtenstein trust, prosecutors said. Two years later, he
met with Mathis, who managed the account and advised the surgeon
not to disclose it to U.S. authorities, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Told the bank was closing the account in September 2009,
Silva made two trips to Zurich to meet with Mathis and the Swiss
banker late last year, prosecutors said. They refused to wire
the funds to the U.S. because it would &#8220;leave a trail&#8221; for law
enforcement and instead gave him $200,000 in two individually
wrapped &#8220;bricks&#8221; of $100,000 each, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid U.S. requirements that he report the importation
of amounts exceeding $10,000 in currency, Silva mailed the cash
home in 26 packages, they said. He had Mathis&#8217; help, prosecutors
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathis is not in U.S. custody. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is USA v. Mathis, 10-cr-260, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of Virginia (Alexandria). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dole Banana Workers Jury Award Tossed Due to Fraud &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dole Food Co., the world&#8217;s biggest producer of fresh fruit
and vegetables, won dismissal of a $2.3 million California jury
award to Nicaraguan banana workers who claimed exposure to
pesticides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California Court of Appeal Judge Victoria Chaney, at a
hearing yesterday in Los Angeles, threw out the 2007 verdict and
the underlying lawsuit, after hearing arguments last week by
Dole lawyers that the plaintiffs had lied about becoming sterile
because of pesticides used at Dole&#8217;s banana farms in Nicaragua
in the late 1970s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The judgment is vacated&#8221; Chaney said, citing &#8220;blatant&#8221;
fraud, active concealment and witness tampering by lawyers in
Nicaragua that deprived Dole of its right to gather evidence in
the Central American country. &#8220;Retrial is not an option.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaney&#8217;s ruling follows her order last year dismissing two
related cases by groups of purported banana workers before they
had gone to trial. She found that the lawsuits were the result
of a pattern of &#8220;deliberate and egregious misconduct&#8221; by
lawyers in Nicaragua who had recruited the plaintiffs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Condie, a lawyer for the Nicaraguans, said he will
appeal the decision. The judge&#8217;s ruling was based on testimony
from secret, so-called John Doe witnesses who the plaintiffs&#8217;
lawyers weren&#8217;t allowed to interview, Condie said after the
hearing. Some of those witnesses later admitted they had been
paid by Dole, according to the lawyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaney said in her decision that she wasn&#8217;t persuaded by
the allegations of bribery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott Edelman, a lawyer for Dole, said after the hearing
that the judge had approved the expenses the company paid for
the protected witnesses. Chaney allowed Dole to introduce
evidence of fraud provided by the anonymous witnesses after the
2007 trial. Dole claimed that the witnesses would be in danger
in Nicaragua if their identities became known. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s never been about banana workers,&#8221; Edelman said.
&#8220;This case was brought by fake banana workers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of Dole&#8217;s records in Nicaragua were destroyed in the
aftermath of the Sandinista revolution, opening the door to the
fraudulent claims, according to lawyers for the company, based
in Westlake Village, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2007 trial has been the only one in the U.S. by foreign
workers claiming sterility from DBCP exposure. Thousands of
similar claims from workers in Central American countries are
pending in state court in Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Tellez v. Dole Food Co., BC312852, Superior
Court of California, Los Angeles County. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundraiser Nemazee Gets 12 Years for Citigroup, HSBC Fraud &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hassan Nemazee, a fundraiser for President Barack Obama and
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, was sentenced to 12 years in
prison for cheating Citigroup Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc and Bank
of America Corp. of $292 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein in New York yesterday
imposed the punishment, including restitution of $292 million to
the three banks. Nemazee can remain free until he reports to
prison by Aug. 27, Stein said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pride, ego, arrogance, self-image, self-importance -- all
of this and more are among the reasons why I turned down this
destructive path,&#8221; Nemazee told the judge before he was
sentenced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nemazee, 60, pleaded guilty in March. The government asked
for a prison term of 15 1/2 to 19 1/2 years, saying he ran a
Ponzi scheme that used proceeds from one bank loan to pay
others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Part of the manner in which the defendant was able to
dupe the banks into lending him substantial sums of money was to
trade on his substantial reputation in political circles as a
prodigious fundraiser,&#8221; the government said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors have hired a forensic expert to help locate
Nemazee&#8217;s assets. They are investigating whether he stashed
assets overseas. The government assailed him in court papers for
failing to cooperate in its investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Lockard valued Nemazee&#8217;s
Manhattan apartment on Park Avenue at $16.5 million, his estate
in Katonah, New York, at $2.1 million, and two other New York
apartments at more than $2 million each. Nemazee also owns real
estate in Italy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors recovered $93.5 million in cash and securities,
including $75 million that Nemazee took from an HSBC line of
credit shortly before his arrest last August, they said. The
government is seeking the return of political and charitable
donations to more than 100 organizations, Lockard said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheila Nemazee, the defendant&#8217;s wife, and other family
members are contesting part of the forfeiture efforts, claiming
assets such as the Park Avenue apartment as their own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Nemazee, 1:09-cr-00902, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ryanair, O&#8217;Leary Settle EasyJet Founder&#8217;s Suit on Pinocchio Ad &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryanair Holdings Plc and Michael O&#8217;Leary, its chief
executive officer, apologized to the founder of rival EasyJet
Plc and agreed to pay about 50,000 pounds ($77,000) to settle a
lawsuit over an advertisement that likened him to Pinocchio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a hearing yesterday at the High Court in London, lawyers
for O&#8217;Leary withdrew allegations made against Stelios Haji-
Ioannou, who prefers to go by Stelios, in a series of
advertisements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a half-page advertisement in the Daily Telegraph
yesterday, O&#8217;Leary and Ryanair apologized &#8220;unreservedly&#8221; for
tagging a photograph of Stelios as &#8220;Easyjet&#8217;s-Mr. Late Again&#8221;
in a prior advertisement carried in the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is not very often that someone as arrogant and as
powerful as O&#8217;Leary is forced to apologize to someone else in
public,&#8221; Stelios said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;I took this
legal action to protect my reputation. I am not a liar and that
statement was libelous.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contested ads, published in January and February, said
EasyJet hadn&#8217;t published its on-time flight statistics for 37
weeks and showed a picture of Stelios with his nose elongated
like the character Pinocchio, Stelios&#8217;s lawyer Chris Scott said
at the hearing yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Stelios asked for an apology, Ryanair refused and said
the dispute should be settled with a sumo wrestling contest or a
race around London&#8217;s Trafalgar Square, Scott said, reading a
joint statement signed by both Stelios&#8217;s and Ryanair&#8217;s lawyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Haji-Ioannou v. O&#8217;Leary, HQ10X00565, High Court
of Justice Queens Bench Division. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skilled Healthcare Agrees to Mediation to Settle Verdict Award &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skilled Healthcare Group Inc., which was ordered by a
California jury to pay $671 million for improperly staffing
nursing homes, agreed to try to settle the case in mediation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skilled Healthcare and the plaintiffs in the suit agreed to
end all litigation during the mediation, the Foothill Ranch,
California-based company said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs accused Skilled Healthcare of improperly
staffing 22 facilities in the state. A Humboldt County jury on
July 6 found the company liable for $613 million in statutory
damages, the maximum allowed by state law, and $58 million for
restitution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was filed in 2006 on behalf of current and
former residents of 22 Skilled Healthcare operations in
California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verdict is the largest jury award in the U.S. this
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Skilled
Healthcare said the award exceeds the policy limits of its
insurance. The company had a net loss of $133 million last year
on revenue of $759.8 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skilled Healthcare also agreed not to file for bankruptcy
protection during the mediation period, which is scheduled to
end Aug. 9. The proposal must be approved by a judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Lavender v. Skilled Healthcare Group, DR060264,
Superior Court, Humboldt County, California (Eureka). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telkom South Africa to Pay $80 Million to End Telcordia Dispute &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telkom South Africa Ltd., Africa&#8217;s largest fixed-line phone
company, said it will pay U.S. software maker Telcordia
Technologies Inc. $80 million to settle a nine-year dispute over
a canceled contract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies reached an agreement based on an arbitration
ruling, Pretoria-based Telkom said in a statement yesterday.
Telkom made a provision of $77 million for the dispute in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute arose in 2001 when Telkom terminated a contract
placed with Telcordia for the supply of a customer-care
management system. Telcordia claimed damages of $128 million
plus interest at an annual rate of 15.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telcordia, based in Piscataway, New Jersey, was acquired in
2005 by private-equity firms Providence Equity Partners Inc. and
Warburg Pincus LLC from Science Applications International
Corp., according to the software maker&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specter Says He Will Back Kagan&#8217;s U.S. Supreme Court Nomination &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Democrat, said he
will support Elena Kagan&#8217;s nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court
even though he has misgivings about her &#8220;non-answers&#8221; to
questions at her confirmation hearings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specter, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said
in a USA Today opinion column he will vote for Kagan in part
because she has endorsed one of his pet causes, allowing
television cameras at Supreme Court arguments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also applauded her high regard for the late Supreme
Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. That suggests Kagan, a Marshall
law clerk, will &#8220;protect individual rights in the
congressional-executive battles,&#8221; Specter wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In addition to her intellect, academic and professional
qualifications, Kagan did just enough to win my vote by her
answers that television would be good for the country and the
court and by identifying Justice Marshall as her role model,&#8217; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Judiciary Committee will vote July 20 on Kagan&#8217;s
nomination, putting it on track for confirmation about two
months before the beginning of the next court term. Jim Manley,
a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, said the full
Senate will vote the week of Aug. 2. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Callaway Golf Co. and other
manufacturers of high-end golf equipment persuaded Chinese law
enforcement officials to raid warehouses where fake merchandise
was stored. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sporting goods makers, operating as the U.S. Golf
Manufacturers Anti-Counterfeiting Working Group, said yesterday
that the Beijing Hadian District Court convicted five sellers of
fakes. The five were sentenced to jail terms of more than one
year and fined about $54,000, according to a statement from the
working group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seized products included more than 2,300 counterfeit
golf clubs and fake copies of authentic golf caps, bags and
accessories made by members of the working group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Callaway, other members of the group are
Acushnet Co., Cleveland Golf/Srixon and Never Compromise, Nike

&lt;p&gt;Re/Max Sues Orlando Realty Max for Trademark Infringement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Re/Max International Inc., a network of real estate
agencies, sued a Florida real estate broker for trademark
infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prism Enterprise of Central Florida Inc., which does
business as Orlando RealtyMax is accused of infringing Re/Max&#8217;s
trademarks through its use of a &#8220;confusingly similar name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prism&#8217;s use of the domain name &#8220;orlandorealtymax.com&#8221;
causes customers confusion, according to the complaint filed
July 13 in federal court in Orlando, Florida. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Florida brokerage continued to use the domain name
after having been sent four letters by Re/Max beginning in July
2005, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Re/Max, of Greenwood Village, Colorado, claims the public
is deceived by Prism&#8217;s actions and is likely to believe
mistakenly that an affiliation exists between the two entities.
It says it suffered &#8220;irreparable harm, damage and injury&#8221; as a
result of Prism&#8217;s alleged infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It asked the court to order Prism to quit using names that
are &#8220;confusingly similar&#8221; to Re/Max&#8217;s, and for an award of
money damages, including Prism&#8217;s profits attributable to the
alleged infringement. Additionally, it asked the damages be
tripled to punish Prism for what RE/Max says is willful
infringement, and for an award of attorney fees and litigation
costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-defendant with Prism is Shalendar Moman of Orlando, an
agent or employee of Prism, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Re/Max is represented by Gregory W. Herbert of Miami&#8217;s

&lt;p&gt;Patents &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rambus Gets 1,000th Patent, With 700 Pending Applications &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rambus Inc., a chip designer that gets 95 percent of its
revenue from patent royalties, received its 1,000th patent, the
Los Altos, California-based company said in a statement
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office, 740 of those are U.S. patents, with the most recent --
7,755,968 -- issued July 13. That patent covers a chip with
dynamic memory bank count and page size, according to the
database. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s patent portfolio covers high-performance
memory and serial solutions, package layout, system design, and
lighting and display technologies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rambus also has 700 pending patent applications, the
company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King Sues Novartis&#8217;s Sandoz to Block Generic Form of EpiPen &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King Pharmaceuticals Inc. sued Novartis AG&#8217;s Sandoz unit to
prevent sales of a lower-cost version of the EpiPen allergic-
reaction treatment until 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sandoz, the world&#8217;s second-biggest generic-drug maker, is
seeking U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to sell a
generic version of EpiPen, according to the lawsuit filed in
federal court in New Jersey July 14. King wants a court to block
approval until a patent expires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EpiPen Auto-Injector is an emergency treatment for people
suffering allergic reactions to insect stings or food, and is
used by the military for nerve-agent antidotes. King obtained
EpiPen as part of its 2003 purchase of Meridian Medical
Technologies. The unit that gets royalties and other revenue
from EpiPen reported $252.6 million in sales last year, King
said in its annual report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual EpiPens sell for as much as $163.50 for a
single-dose injection at various pharmacy websites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of its FDA application, Sandoz said its version of
the device wouldn&#8217;t infringe the patent, or that the patent was
invalid or unenforceable, according to King&#8217;s complaint. An
official with Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis didn&#8217;t
immediately return a message seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King, based in Bristol, Tennessee, already is suing Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., the world&#8217;s biggest generic-drug
maker, over Teva&#8217;s plan to sell a generic EpiPen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is King Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Sandoz Inc.,
10cv3568, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey (Trenton). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony Infringed Clark Rockefeller Picture, Photographer Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony Corp.&#8217;s Sony Pictures Television unit was sued for
copyright infringement by a Boston photographer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit stems from a photo Donald A. Harney shot of Clark
Rockefeller and his daughter Reigh. Rockefeller, who was born
Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter, was convicted of kidnapping his
daughter, and, according to court papers, Harney&#8217;s photo was
used by police and the FBI in their search for Rockefeller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harney claims Sony&#8217;s made-for-television movie &#8220;Who is
Clark Rockefeller&#8221; used his photo to create the image of the
actors. The image Sony created for the movie &#8220;was clearly made
to look like Harney&#8217;s photograph,&#8221; according to the complaint
filed July 14 in federal court in Boston. The film was
distributed on AE Television and is also available on the
website of one of its units, www.mylifetime.com, according to
court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image was used without authorization or compensation,
Harney said in his complaint. The &#8220;use, distribution and
publication&#8221; of the film constitutes copyright infringement, he
said in his pleadings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harney asked the court to order the seizure of all copies
of the film in any form, that the photograph be deleted from the
movie, and for an award of money damages, attorney fees and
litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is represented by Andrew D. Epstein of Boston&#8217;s Barker,
Epstein  Loscocco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Harney v. Sony Pictures Television Inc., 1:10-
cv-11181, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts
(Boston). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Drops China Software Piracy Suit Against CITIC Kington &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest software maker,
dropped an intellectual property lawsuit against a Chinese
company after the two sides reached an agreement on software
purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft agreed to settle a lawsuit it filed against CITIC
Kington Securities at a court in the eastern city of Hangzhou,
the U.S. company said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. CITIC
Kington will buy 3.23 million yuan ($477,000) of Microsoft
software as part of the settlement, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maker of the Windows operating system is stepping up
action against Chinese companies for unlicensed software use.
Microsoft is losing billions of dollars to software piracy in
the world&#8217;s third-biggest economy, Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said in April it won a decision from a court in
Shanghai against a Chinese insurance company for intellectual
property infringement. Last year, four people were sentenced to
prison terms for distributing pirated Microsoft products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BMG Acquires Rights to Aerosmith, ZZ Top, David Essex Songs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BMG Rights Management GmbH, the music-rights venture owned
by Bertelsmann AG and KKR  Co., agreed to buy independent music
publisher Stage Three Music, the companies said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage Three holds the rights to classic songs and writers,
including songs performed by Aerosmith, David Essex, ZZ Top and
Macy Gray, according to the company&#8217;s website. BMG said it was
acquiring those rights from Stage Three shareholders Apax
Partners, Ingenious Ventures and company management. Terms of
the deal weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competition is increasing for music publishing catalogs and
the income the lyrics and melodies generate from stores, radio
and Internet play, ads and movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike recorded music, publishing is buffered from falling
CD sales by its more diverse revenue sources. Owners can earn
cash returns of 7 to more than 20 percent a year, depending on
the songs and how they&#8217;re marketed, investors and dealmakers
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;University Technology Transfer &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iowa State Spins off Avello With University-Developed Technology &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avello Bionergy Inc., a company aimed at seeking new fuel
sources, has been spun off from research at Iowa State
University, the school said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, based at the university&#8217;s BioCentury Research
Farm near Ames, Iowa, is based on technology developed by
Professor Robert C. Brown of the school of engineering and
director of the school&#8217;s Bioeconomy Institute and his students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They use a technology known as &#8220;fast pyrolysis,&#8221; which is
involved in heating biomass such as corn stalks and leaves in
the absence of oxygen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This produces a liquid known as bio-oil that can be used to
manufacture fuels, chemicals and a solid product that can be
used to enrich soil and remove green house gases from the
atmosphere. According to the school, a patent application has
been filed for the technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avello received early stage funding from a Des Moines,
Iowa-based venture firm, according to the company website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to fuel products, Avello produces Bio-asphalt,
a product that can be used to replace petroleum-based liquid
asphalt for roofing and paving applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IP Moves &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bracewell  Giuliani Hires IP Lawyer for New Seattle Office &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bracewell  Giuliani LLP hired Christopher Schenck for its
new Seattle office, the Houston-based firm said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schenck, who previously practiced at Seattle&#8217;s Riddell
Williams PS, will do patent-litigation work at the firm. He will
be representing clients in the software and semiconductor
industries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has an undergraduate degree in computer science from the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a law degree
from Georgetown University. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian stocks gained for the third
day this week as oil topped $76 a barrel and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. settled with U.S. regulators, improving appetite for
riskier assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OAO Surgutneftegaz, the country&#8217;s fourth-largest oil
producer, added 1.2 percent. OAO Uralkali, Russia&#8217;s second-
largest potash producer, increased 0.6 percent, helping push the
Micex Index of 30 stocks 0.5 percent higher to 1,346.3 as of
1:57 p.m. in Moscow trading. The gauge erased losses of as much
as 0.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude, Russia&#8217;s biggest export earner, traded higher at
$76.67 after sliding yesterday when economic reports in the U.S.
disappointed investors. Goldman Sachs agreed yesterday to pay
$550 million and change its business practices to settle claims
it misled investors, sending U.S. stocks up from an early slump.
Concern the Goldman probe could widen was seen to be curbing
appetite for riskier assets and commodities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors seem to be happy with the Goldman result,&#8221;
Daniel Salter, an emerging-markets strategist at ING Groep NV in
Moscow, said by phone. &#8220;But the market is going to be volatile
for the next quarter with long-only money reluctant to commit to
Russia given the current volatility.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmark MSCI Russia index may rise to 980 by July
next year, ING said in an e-mailed note dated yesterday.
&#8220;Assuming a double dip can be avoided, our base case sees oil
trading at $80 a barrel&#8221; with &#8220;low global interest rates
supporting valuations,&#8221; analysts led by Salter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Micex has fallen 12 percent since its April 15 peak on
concern economic growth may slow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KfW Group, Germany&#8217;s development
bank that bailed out IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG, said it is
reviewing Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s settlement with U.S.
regulators that includes a $150 million payment to IKB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, based in New York, agreed to pay $550
million to settle U.S. regulatory claims it misled investors
over collateralized debt obligations linked to subprime
mortgages, the Securities and Exchange Commission said
yesterday. As part of the agreement, Goldman agreed to pay a
$300 million fine and $250 million in restitution to investors
including IKB and Royal Bank of Scotland Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;KfW is examining the decision from last night,&#8221;
spokesman Michael Helbig said today, declining further comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IKB spokesman Patrick von der Ehe said a unit of Rhineland
Funding, IKB&#8217;s former investment vehicle, invested in the
Goldman securities. Rhineland Funding ran out of money amid the
credit crunch in 2007, forcing KfW to assume 8.1 billion euros
of IKB&#8217;s financing obligations to prevent a collapse of the
lender. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s $550
million settlement with U.S. regulators yesterday will benefit
the firm by ending three months of uncertainty at an affordable
price. Now the rest of Wall Street begins calculating the cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors welcomed the deal with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, saying the company won key points: The cost
was below some analysts&#8217; estimates of at least $1 billion; no
management changes were required; and Goldman Sachs said the SEC
indicated it doesn&#8217;t plan claims related to other mortgage-
linked securities it examined. The stock&#8217;s late surge on
anticipation of a settlement yesterday added more than $3
billion to the company&#8217;s market value, and it climbed further
after New York trading closed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;d have to look at it as a victory for Goldman,&#8221; said
Peter Sorrentino, senior portfolio manager at Huntington Asset
Advisors in Cincinnati, which manages $13.3 billion including
Goldman Sachs shares. &#8220;This takes a cloud off the stock.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the settlement, unveiled less than two hours after the
Senate passed legislation to reform the financial system and
avert future crises, Goldman Sachs acknowledged that marketing
materials for the 2007 deal at the center of the case contained
&#8220;incomplete information.&#8221; In its April 16 suit, the SEC
accused the firm of defrauding investors in a mortgage-backed
collateralized debt obligation by failing to tell them that
hedge fund Paulson  Co., which was planning to bet against the
deal, had helped to design it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;One of the Worst Days&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its original public response, Goldman Sachs had called
the SEC&#8217;s case &#8220;unfounded in law and fact&#8221; and maintained that
it made all disclosures about the CDOs that should be material
to the &#8220;sophisticated&#8221; investors who lost money on the deal.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, who said
the day the suit was filed was &#8220;one of the worst days in my
professional life,&#8221; said in May that the bank established a
committee to review the firm&#8217;s business standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement requires the New York-based company to
increase training for employees who structure or market mortgage
securities, and to bolster the vetting and approval process.
Those changes will probably lead to a new industry standard for
disclosures in private sales of securities, even to the most
sophisticated investors, analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All of the firms are going to adjust their internal
standards for this,&#8221; Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein  Co. in New York, said in an interview. The agreement
means &#8220;a private placement doesn&#8217;t absolve you from the
accuracy of the disclosure and you&#8217;d better have very, very good
compliance watching what your sales people are saying.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Best Practices&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Khuzami, the SEC&#8217;s director of enforcement, said at
a news conference yesterday that his agency means to send a
signal to the entire industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We would strongly encourage other institutions to adopt
any kinds of best practices that they see across the street in
order to prevent this kind of wrongdoing,&#8221; said Khuzami, 53.
&#8220;The deterrence, and preventing a fraud before it occurs, is a
much better outcome than picking up the pieces afterwards.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC is still investigating other companies and a range
of products that fueled losses during the financial crisis,
Khuzami said. Last month, the agency sued New York-based ICP
Asset Management LLC on claims that it improperly traded assets
in CDOs it managed. ICP has denied wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said in a statement that the SEC doesn&#8217;t plan
to target the firm over any other products that the agency has
reviewed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case Against Tourre &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We understand that the SEC staff also has completed a
review of a number of other Goldman Sachs mortgage-related CDO
transactions and does not anticipate recommending any claims
against Goldman Sachs or any of its employees,&#8221; the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC&#8217;s case continues against Fabrice Tourre, the only
Goldman Sachs employee the agency sued over the CDO. Tourre, 31,
is due to respond to the complaint by July 19. He told a Senate
subcommittee in April that he &#8220;categorically&#8221; denies the SEC&#8217;s
allegations and will fight them in court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC&#8217;s deputy enforcement director, Lorin Reisner, said
Goldman Sachs agreed to cooperate in the case against Tourre,
who is on leave and whose legal expenses are being paid by the
company. Tourre&#8217;s attorney, Pamela Chepiga at Allen  Overy LLP,
didn&#8217;t reply to an e-mail and phone message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, 55, and the firm&#8217;s other senior managers may not
emerge from the SEC case unscathed, even if they weren&#8217;t forced
to resign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Repair Their Reputation&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Within a decent interval, you&#8217;re probably going to see a
new CEO,&#8221; said Christopher Whalen, a New York Federal Reserve
official in the 1980s and co-founder of Institutional Risk
Analytics, in an interview on Bloomberg Television. &#8220;They still
have a lot of work to do with clients and may face claims and
litigation going forward, and they have to repair their
reputation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Cohan, an author and former investment banker who
is writing a book about Goldman Sachs, said that Blankfein&#8217;s
position is secure for the &#8220;foreseeable future.&#8221; Cohan expects
the next CEO will come from an investment banking background
rather than trading, the business drawing regulators&#8217; scrutiny. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I will predict that this is the last trading-oriented CEO
of Goldman Sachs for a while,&#8221; Cohan said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro, 55, has previously denied
speculation that the lawsuit was filed to support financial-
reform legislation backed by President Barack Obama by casting
Goldman Sachs, the most profitable securities firm in Wall
Street history, as a villain. There was &#8220;absolutely no
consideration&#8221; to the bill, Khuzami told reporters, hours after
the bill cleared the Senate. Still, the timing raised some
eyebrows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Highly Suspicious&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is highly suspicious, and it makes the SEC now look
like it is totally politicized,&#8221; said Paul Atkins, a former
Republican SEC commissioner who is now a financial services
consultant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the SEC touted the $550 million settlement as the
largest it ever levied against a Wall Street firm, it fell short
of some analysts&#8217; estimates for a $1 billion fine. Hintz, who
estimated the agreement will shave 93 cents from the firm&#8217;s
earnings, said he had predicted it would cost $1.05 per share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Goldman Sachs, the cost represents about 14
days&#8217; worth of earnings, based on first-quarter profit.
Blankfein, who was awarded a record-setting $67.9 million bonus
for 2007, has stock in the firm that&#8217;s worth almost $490
million, based on the firm&#8217;s last proxy statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares Gain &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC&#8217;s disclosure yesterday that it planned a
&#8220;significant announcement&#8221; fueled speculation that a deal was
imminent, sending the firm&#8217;s shares up 4.4 percent to $145.22 at
the end of New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock,
which had lost more than 20 percent since the suit was filed, is
likely to rise further, said Hintz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m jumping up and down and telling my dad to buy it,&#8221;
Hintz said of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Merrill Lynch said it upgraded its rating
on Goldman Sachs to &#8220;buy&#8221; in a note to clients following the
agreement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement is &#8220;palatable&#8221; and the &#8220;probability of
further action against Goldman Sachs&#8221; is much lower, said
analysts led by New York-based Guy Moszkowski in the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs rose 5.1 percent to $152.59 at 9:50 a.m. in
German trading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stress tests of European banks
aren&#8217;t likely to force major publicly listed lenders to bolster
their capital by selling new shares, analysts at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We do not expect large listed European banks to raise
equity as a result of the stress tests,&#8221; London-based Goldman
Sachs analysts, including Jernej Omahen and Frederik Thomasen,
wrote in a report to clients dated today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Union regulators are examining the strength of
banks as they seek to reassure investors about the institutions&#8217;
resilience to potential losses as the debt crisis pummels the
bonds of Greece, Spain and Portugal. The stress tests include a
total of 91 of the biggest banks, representing 65 percent of the
European industry. The results are scheduled for partial
publication on July 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming a 6 percent Tier 1 hurdle rate, &#8220;it should not be
surprising that most banks participating in the stress test
should show favorable results,&#8221; the analysts wrote. &#8220;This
includes many of the public-sector institutions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs raised its recommendation on Spain&#8217;s Banco
Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA to &#8220;buy&#8221; from &#8220;neutral&#8221; in the
report, saying &#8220;the resilience provided by its international
operations is underappreciated.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services company, fell in
late trading after the company reported revenue that missed
analysts&#8217; estimates and a decline in services-contract signings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue last quarter rose 2 percent to $23.7 billion, the
Armonk, New York-based company said today. Analysts on average
estimated $24.2 billion, according to a Bloomberg survey.
Currency fluctuations reduced sales by $500 million, IBM said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Services signings declined 12 percent to $12.3 billion,
suggesting corporate customers are delaying projects even as the
economy recovers. It&#8217;s the second straight quarterly decline in
contracts for services, which makes up more than half of IBM&#8217;s
total revenue. Shares fell as much 4.3 percent in late trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors simply want to see a bit more in terms of
revenue and bookings,&#8221; said Andy Miedler, a St. Louis-based
analyst at Edward Jones who rates the shares &#8220;buy.&#8221; &#8220;The
market is in &#8216;show-me&#8217; mode. You can&#8217;t just tell us you&#8217;re going
to do this.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM also boosted its full-year profit forecast to at least
$11.25 a share, missing analysts&#8217; average estimate of $11.28.
The company had previously projected profit of at least $11.20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signings declined last quarter as many customers didn&#8217;t
renew contract extensions while some clients put off closing
contracts until the current quarter, Chief Financial Officer
Mark Loughridge said on a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loughridge cautioned against viewing the results as a sign
of &#8220;a pullback in spending.&#8221; The rollover of deals into the
current quarter &#8220;should accelerate performance in the
outsourcing signings,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares Fall &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM fell as much as $5.59 to $124.20 in extended trading
after reporting the results. The stock closed at $129.79 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading and has lost less than 1
percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM gets almost a third of its revenue from Europe, whose
currency fell 9.4 percent against the dollar last quarter.
Although the impact from foreign-exchange rates was anticipated,
not all analysts took it into account with their estimates, said
Deutsche Bank AG analyst Chris Whitmore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a headwind,&#8221; said San Francisco-based
Whitmore, who rates the shares &#8220;buy&#8221; and doesn&#8217;t own them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income climbed to $3.39 billion, or $2.61 a share,
compared with $3.1 billion, or $2.32, a year earlier. Analysts
estimated earnings of $2.58 a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currency fluctuations hurt profit by about 10 cents to 11
cents, Loughridge said on the call. IBM also said it would
introduce its new mainframe computer, part of its System z
series, this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acquisition Outlook &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano expects IBM to almost
double operating earnings to $20 per share by 2015, as he
continues to focus on more profitable software and services
businesses. The software segment, the company&#8217;s most profitable,
will make up about half of total profit in five years, Palmisano
has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmisano plans to make about $20 billion in acquisitions
in the timeframe. IBM is investing in markets such as analytics
software, which helps companies predict trends, and cloud
computing, which lets them store and access information on
shared servers. The company is also developing services to
monitor highways, electrical grids and other infrastructures to
help them run more efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased sales of those technologies, along with growth
markets such as Brazil and China, will add $20 billion to
revenue by 2015, IBM has said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fabrice Tourre, the Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. executive director sued by the Securities and
Exchange Commission for fraud, disputed regulators&#8217; allegations
in a filing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre in his filing today in federal court in Manhattan
denied wrongdoing and said he was aware that hedge fund Paulson
 Co. &#8220;was considering taking some or all of the short side&#8221;
of a transaction involving the 2007 sale of a collateralized
debt obligation called Abacus 2007-AC1 that was linked to
subprime mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre responded four days after Goldman Sachs, the most
profitable securities firm in Wall Street history, agreed to
settle its role in the case for $550 million. The firm also will
cooperate in the SEC&#8217;s investigation of Tourre, 31, who remains
an employee. Tourre is on leave and his legal expenses are being
paid by New York-based Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The purported claims against Mr. Tourre and the
allegations upon which they are based are improperly vague,
ambiguous and confusing, and omit critical facts,&#8221; the filing
said. &#8220;Mr. Tourre, a French citizen and engineer by training,
reasonably relied on Goldman Sachs&#8217; institutional process to
ensure adequate legal review and disclosure of material
information, and cannot be held liable for any alleged failings
of that process.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index futures expiring in September
slipped 0.3 percent to 1,060.20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICU Medical Inc. (ICUI US): The maker of connectors used in

will buy back as much as $40 million of shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM US) declined 4.1
percent to $124.47. The world&#8217;s biggest computer-services

estimates as the falling euro weighed on revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN US) slipped 5.6 percent to

quarter profit and sales that fell short of analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tupperware Brands Corp. (TUP US) dropped 12 percent to

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks rose, rebounding from
the market&#8217;s biggest drop this month, as optimism about earnings
from technology and energy companies overshadowed a drop in
financial shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. climbed 1.4 percent after UBS AG raised its
earnings estimate, citing signs of stronger demand. Halliburton
Co. jumped 6 percent after topping analysts&#8217; earnings and
revenue estimates. Bank of America Corp. slumped 2.7 percent as
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. took the shares off its &#8220;conviction
buy&#8221; list, saying low rates may hurt interest income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 rose 0.6 percent to 1,071.25 as of 4 p.m. in
New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 56.53
points, or 0.6 percent, to 10,154.43 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market is focusing on revenue growth this earnings
season and, outside of financials, companies seem to be
delivering that,&#8221; said Mark Freeman, a money manager at
Westwood Management Corp. in Dallas, which oversees $10.5
billion. &#8220;It&#8217;s really a question of whether the earnings
reports can come in strong enough now to support investor
confidence.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 gained 4.8 percent since July 2 on optimism
that corporate earnings would signal the economic recovery is
sustainable. Of the 24 companies in the SP 500 that reported
from July 12 through the beginning of regular trading this
morning, all but three topped earnings-per-share forecasts,
according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks Declined &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks declined last week following lower-than-
estimated revenue at Bank of America, Citigroup Inc. and General
Electric Co. and a drop in consumer confidence to the lowest
level in a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., which is scheduled to report fourth-
quarter results on July 22, gained 1.4 percent to $25.23 as UBS
AG raised its earnings estimate for the software maker to 47
cents a share from 45 cents for the fiscal fourth quarter.
Analysts cited &#8220;early signs of enterprise demand returning.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halliburton rose the most in the SP 500, rallying 6
percent to $29.17 after the company reported an 83 percent
increase in second-quarter profit to $480 million, or 53 cents a
share, as gains in onshore drilling made up for a halt to new
wells in the Gulf of Mexico. Earnings from continuing operations
were 52 cents a share, topping the average analyst estimate of
37 cents. Revenue was $4.39 billion, beating the average
projection of $4.09 billion in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education Stocks Surge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For-profit education stocks surged amid speculation
President Barack Obama&#8217;s proposed industry regulations won&#8217;t
reduce profit as much as had been projected. Education
Management Corp. jumped 17 percent to $18.49. Corinthian
Colleges Inc. rose 9.1 percent to $10.40. Bridgepoint Education
Inc. advanced 10 percent to $17.31. Apollo Group Inc., owner of
the biggest for-profit university in the U.S. by enrollment,
climbed 5.4 percent to $48.03. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. rose 1.4 percent to
$129.79 in the regular session. Shares fell 3.7 percent to
$124.96 in trading after the official close of markets after the
world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider reported second-
quarter sales that missed analysts&#8217; estimates as the falling
euro weighed on revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas Instruments Inc., the second-biggest U.S. chipmaker,
and Zions Bancorp also fell in after-market trading after
reporting earnings results that missed estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Falls &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc., the maker of iPods and Macintosh computers,
declined 1.7 percent to 245.58. The Cupertino, California-based
company may report worse-than-expected results when it posts
quarterly earnings tomorrow, said Stifel Nicolaus  Co., which
cited &#8220;evidence of ongoing component shortages.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks turned lower earlier as the National Association of
Home Builders/Wells Fargo confidence index dropped to 14 this
month, the lowest level since April 2009, from 16 in June.
Readings lower than 50 mean more respondents said conditions
were poor. The index was forecast to fall to 16 from a
previously reported 17 in June, according to the median estimate
in the survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While we can easily blame the expiration of the tax
credit for the dropoff&#8221; in builder confidence, Peter Boockvar,
equity strategist at Miller Tabak  Co. in New York, said in an
e-mailed note, &#8220;according to the NAHB, &#8216;builders are reporting
continuing consumer hesitancy regarding home purchases due to
uncertainty in the overall economy and job markets.&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toll Brothers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toll Brothers Inc. dropped 1.2 percent to $16.23. An index
of homebuilders across SP indexes fell 1.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airlines declined after Delta Air Lines Inc., the world&#8217;s
largest carrier, forecast a third-quarter operating margin of no
more than 12 percent, missing analyst estimates. Delta sank 2.9
percent to $11.38. UAL Corp. lost 0.8 percent to $21.18.
Continental Airlines Inc. dropped 0.4 percent to $22.78. AMR
Corp. lost 1.9 percent to $6.74. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America dropped 2.7 percent to $13.61. The largest
U.S. bank by assets was removed from Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
&#8220;conviction buy&#8221; list and downgraded to &#8220;hold&#8221; from &#8220;buy&#8221;
at ISI Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anadarko Petroleum Corp. fell the most in the SP 500,
losing 4.1 percent to $45.52 as Kenneth Feinberg, who is
overseeing a $20 billion fund to pay damage claims from the Gulf
of Mexico oil spill, said the BP Plc partner could still be sued
by victims even if they had been paid from BP&#8217;s fund. The
London-based oil company&#8217;s U.S. traded shares fell 3.6 percent
to $35.75. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. sued the Texas
Rangers, claiming the bankrupt baseball team breached the terms
of a loan by taking over the lease for its stadium, Rangers
Ballpark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transferring the lease to Texas Rangers Baseball Partners
made it harder for lenders to collect at least $411 million owed
by the team&#8217;s owner, Tom Hicks&#8217;s HSG Sports Group LLC, JPMorgan
said in a lawsuit filed July 16 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Fort
Worth, Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When HSG borrowed the money, it agreed that certain units
and affiliates would help pay back the loan if necessary,
according to court papers. The HSG unit that controlled the
lease was obligated to repay the full amount while Texas Rangers
Baseball Partners was liable only for $75 million, New York-
based JPMorgan said in court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After filing for bankruptcy in May, the Rangers, based in
Arlington, Texas, sought court permission to sell the club to a
group led by Hall of Fame pitcher and team President Nolan Ryan
and attorney Chuck Greenberg in a transaction valued at more
than $500 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge D. Michael Lynn ordered the team put
up for auction on Aug. 4, with the Ryan-Greenberg group acting
as the lead bidders. Afterward, he will consider approving the
company&#8217;s bankruptcy exit plan, which details how the money
generated from a sale would pay creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;July 28 Deadline &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creditors have until July 28 to vote on the plan, which
means they won&#8217;t know the outcome of auction when they cast
their ballots. Lynn must take those votes into consideration
when deciding whether to approve the bankruptcy exit plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders, led by JPMorgan, oppose the sale, arguing that it
doesn&#8217;t give competitors time to prepare. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the agent for investors who loaned the money to
HSG, asked the judge to declare the transfer null and void
because it violated the mortgage on the property. The lease on
the stadium in Arlington, Texas, is collateral for the loan,
according to court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Semer, a spokesman for the Rangers, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Texas Rangers Baseball Partners, 10-
43400, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas (Fort
Worth). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Korea Gas, the largest LNG buyer in the world according to

&lt;p&gt;Suriname&#8217;s former military ruler
Desi Bouterse, convicted in the Netherlands for cocaine
smuggling, was elected to succeed Ronald Venetiaan as the South
American country&#8217;s president. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bouterse was elected head of state by the National Assembly
in the capital Paramaribo today after his four-party coalition
won 23 of 51 seats in May parliamentary elections. The
Netherlands, which granted Suriname independence in 1975, said
the former dictator wouldn&#8217;t be welcome in the country except to
serve out an 11-year prison sentence for his crime, Dutch
Foreign Minister Maxime Verhagen said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bouterse, 64, led a group of army sergeants that overthrew
Suriname&#8217;s democratic government in 1980 and declared a
socialist course. The military ruled the country&#8217;s 490,000
inhabitants until 1987. The country borders Brazil and is known
for its bauxite mines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bouterse&#8217;s National Democratic Party is part of the
coalition known as the Mega Combination that in May defeated the
ruling New Front coalition. Chandrikapersad Santokhi, Minister
of Justice and Police and a member of the outgoing coalition,
came in second place in the presidential vote today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Appeals Court in The Hague in 2000 sentenced Bouterse
in absentia to 11 years in prison for smuggling cocaine with
others into the Netherlands in 1997. Separately, Bouterse is on
trial in Suriname for the death of 15 alleged opponents of his
military regime in December 1982, according to Dutch news agency
ANP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11-Year Sentence &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Netherlands respects the outcome of the democratic
elections and the choice of the Suriname parliament,&#8221; Verhagen
said in an e-mailed statement today. The Netherlands will only
have contact with Bouterse on a &#8220;functional level&#8221; and meet
its obligations to the former colony unless developments make
this impossible, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We can&#8217;t brush aside that Bouterse has been sentenced to
11 years in the Netherlands for drug trafficking, he&#8217;s not
welcome in the Netherlands other than to serve his sentence,&#8221;
Verhagen said. Verhagen will not seek to arrest Bouterse as the
new president is immune from prosecution during his term. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A surge in imports and slower
consumer spending reduced U.S. economic growth in the second
quarter, according to economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest economy grew at a 2 percent annual pace
from April through June, down from a previously estimated 3
percent pace, according to revised estimates by Goldman
economists. Forecasts for the second half of the year remained
at an average 1.5 percent pending the government&#8217;s annual
revisions to gross domestic product due July 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At that point, we may need to make downward revisions,
judging from the relentless run on disappointments in recent
weeks,&#8221; Ed McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs in New
York wrote in a July 16 note to clients. &#8220;While it is
conceivable that the slowdown will prove fleeting, several
factors strongly suggest otherwise.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the issues that will damp growth in the second half
are the loss of support from fiscal stimulus and inventory
replenishment, the excess supply of vacant housing, state and
local budget constraints, a lack of credit, and weak employment
gains, McKelvey said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cut in the growth forecast follows similar reductions
by economists at JPMorgan Chase  Co. and UBS Securities LLC in
New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re happy to have been selected and we&#8217;re working on
this bid with our two partners,&#8221; Gounon said on a conference
call with journalist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A successful bid by its GB Speedrail consortium would give
Eurotunnel a 30-year franchise to operate the link between the
tunnel and the British capital&#8217;s St. Pancras station. Besides
Eurostar trains, the high-speed link is used by Hitachi Ltd.
Javelin commuter trains and freight operators, earning about 250
million pounds ($383 million) a year in access charges, with
about 35 percent of its capacity unused. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britain&#8217;s new coalition government aims raise at least 1.5
billion pounds by selling the concession, as part of an asset-
disposal program to reduce its budget deficit. The successful
bidder will also run St. Pancras station and terminals at
Stratford, Ebbsfleet and Ashford, east of London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tunnel Fire &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paris-based Eurotunnel today posted a first-half net loss
of 45 million euros ($58 million) on financing costs and delayed
insurance payouts linked to a 2008 tunnel fire. Sales rose 22
percent to 331 million euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not traffic that&#8217;s pushing us into the red,&#8221; Gounon
said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the insurance companies.&#8221; Unless they resolve a
delay in compensation for fire-related losses, &#8220;we will post a
loss for the full year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traffic has still not fully recovered from a 2008 fire that
closed a section of one of the link&#8217;s two tunnels for five
months, Gounon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eurotunnel fell as much as 14 cents, or 2.4 percent, to
5.79 euros and traded at 5.80 euros at 10:41 a.m. on the Paris
exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from the shuttle service, which accounts for about
two-thirds of Eurotunnel&#8217;s business, rose 17 percent to 171
million euros in the first half. Car traffic rose 17 percent,
coaches gained 8 percent and truck traffic jumped 41 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freight Traffic &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from rail operators including Eurostar gained 4.1
percent to 126 million euros, while freight traffic rose 2
percent in the first six months to 589,044 metric tons. By 2013,
the company is aiming for a return to 3 million metric tons,
just short of its 1998 peak, by slashing freight tariffs and
introducing its own locomotives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization rose 3 percent to 143 million euros in the first
half even though expected insurance payouts failed to
materialize. Excluding last year&#8217;s payout, the gain was 39
percent, Eurotunnel said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debt financing costs grew by one-third to 125 million euros
from 95 million euros, as U.K. inflation rose. Under the terms
of a reorganization three years ago, the interest on part of
Eurotunnel&#8217;s debt is index-linked to inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eurotunnel escaped collapse in a January 2007 rescue that
slashed its 6.2 billion pounds of debt by more than half. It
recorded its first annual profit the same year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said
second-quarter profit dropped 82 percent, missing analysts&#8217;
estimates on a slide in trading revenue five days after settling
U.S. regulators&#8217; fraud allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income fell to $613 million, or 78 cents a share, from
$3.44 billion, or $4.93, a year earlier, New York-based Goldman
Sachs said in a statement today. The average estimate of 21
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for earnings of $1.99 per
share, with estimates ranging from 77 cents to $4.34. Some of
the analysts didn&#8217;t include costs of the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s chairman and chief
executive officer, is working to restore the firm&#8217;s reputation
after agreeing to pay $550 million to settle the Securities and
Exchange Commission&#8217;s fraud accusations. The bank&#8217;s bigger
competitors, including JPMorgan Chase  Co., last week also
reported lower trading revenue as market gyrations reduced
clients&#8217; willingness to take on risk. Concern that the U.S.
economic rebound will stall and reform legislation will crimp
profits at finance companies have weighed on their stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The clouds over the financial industry remain thick,&#8221;
said Michael Farr, president and founder of Washington-based
Farr, Miller  Washington LLC, who manages more than $650
million. Farr, who sold his Goldman Sachs stock when the SEC
suit was filed on April 16, said he&#8217;s considering buying again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;ve got probably the greatest, most innovative
investment bank in the world, leading the category, which looks
cheap,&#8221; Farr said before earnings were released. &#8220;I have not
put my money back in yet but I am taking a close look at doing
just that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Share Performance &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs fell 49 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $145.68 in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, leaving the
stock down 14 percent this year through yesterday. The SP 500
Financials Index, which tracks the performance of 80 financial
company shares, is down 2 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s shares rebounded last week on news that the
firm had reached a settlement with the SEC over its 2007 sale of
a collateralized debt obligation. The cost was lower than the $1
billion some analysts had estimated and the settlement didn&#8217;t
require any management changes. Analysts slashed earnings
estimates in recent weeks on concern market declines would hurt
trading revenue as well as on costs related to the settlement
and a one-time bonus tax imposed in the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People have gotten overly pessimistic on Goldman,&#8221;
Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales Partners LLC, said
before the earnings were released. &#8220;We don&#8217;t believe they&#8217;ve
lost big chunks of their client base, and we do believe in their
risk-management capabilities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares in some of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s biggest rivals fell last
week after they reported revenue that was lower than investors
predicted. JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s second-quarter net revenue dropped 9
percent from the first quarter as revenue at the investment bank
unit slid 24 percent. Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s revenue fell 9
percent as global banking and markets revenue tumbled 38
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, which was the second-biggest securities
firm after Goldman Sachs before both converted to banks in 2008,
is due to report earnings tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors and analysts said before the earnings that
they&#8217;re keen for news on how the settlement, which imposes
changes to the way Goldman Sachs sells mortgage-related
securities, and the wider financial regulatory reform bill
passed by the U.S. Senate last week will affect earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I do think there will actually be business reforms where
their risk taking might be reined in,&#8221; said Portales Partners
LLC&#8217;s Peabody. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any question that Goldman
did play in the grey areas&#8221; and curbing that &#8220;reduces your
opportunities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the bank
that makes the most trading equities, lost money in the second
quarter by betting on a drop in stock-market volatility just as
a gauge of equity-price swings surged to a one-year high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Primarily in response to our client needs, our equity
derivatives business was short volatility entering the second
quarter and posted poor results,&#8221; Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said on a conference call with reporters today. The firm
didn&#8217;t break out the size of the loss or the overall results
from the equity derivatives group responsible for the business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or the
VIX, is the most widely used measure of volatility. The index,
which started the second quarter at 17.47, rose as high as 45.79
on May 20 before ending the quarter at 34.54. The index, which
measures the cost of using options as insurance against declines
in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index, has averaged 20.38 over its
two-decade history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said the division&#8217;s revenue slumped 62
percent in the second quarter from a year earlier to $1.21
billion. Still, the unit&#8217;s revenue beat equities divisions at
JPMorgan Chase  Co., Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp.
in the quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Volatility Just Spiked&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clients wanted to hedge against an increase in volatility,
Viniar said on the call. &#8220;We took the other side because you
know we deal with our clients all the time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We had
that position going into the quarter and volatility just
spiked.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The client demand described by Viniar seems to indicate
that clients took the opposite tack of the one recommended by
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s own economics and strategy team. In a Dec. 2,
2009, note about Goldman Sachs&#8217;s &#8220;top trades for 2010,&#8221; the
first recommendation made to clients is that they hold short
positions in so-called variance swaps as a way of betting on
falling volatility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even in a sluggish recovery and a range-bound equity
market, as macro-driven uncertainty declines, volatility can
continue to moderate,&#8221; the note said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risks Not Offset &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some investors and analysts expressed surprise that Goldman
Sachs, which prides itself on its risk-management success,
didn&#8217;t have positions that could hedge any losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would think they&#8217;d try to hedge out and offset those
risks,&#8221; said Benjamin Wallace, an analyst at Grimes  Co. in
Westborough, Massachusetts, which manages $800 million and
doesn&#8217;t hold Goldman Sachs stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roger Freeman, an analyst at Barclays Capital in New York,
asked Viniar on a call with investors today why the firm didn&#8217;t
have any hedges against the jump in volatility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would say we didn&#8217;t hedge it fast enough,&#8221; Viniar
replied. &#8220;Things spiked really dramatically really fast.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which set a Wall Street profit record for a
U.S. securities firm in 2007, reported today that second-quarter
profit tumbled 82 percent from a year earlier as revenue from
trading equities as well as fixed-income, currencies and
commodities dropped 44 percent from a year earlier. The stock
rose 2.2 percent to $148.91 as of 6:10 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viniar said the firm reduced the size of its market bets
during the quarter to the lowest in three years as measured by
value-at-risk. VaR, a statistical measure of how much the firm
could lose in a single day of trading, dropped to an average of
$136 million in the quarter from $161 million in the first
quarter and $245 million a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s kind of hard to fault them for being wrong every now
and then,&#8221; said Alan Villalon, a senior research analyst at FAF
Advisors, which owns Goldman Sachs shares. &#8220;They&#8217;ve kept
raising the bar themselves, but there&#8217;s going to be a hiccup
every now and then.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Crayton Harrison" date="Jul 20, 2010  5:16 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-07-20/televisa-nii-prepare-to-challenge-slim-s-america-movil-after-auction.html"><headline>Televisa, NII to Battle America Movil After Auction</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SA (TLEVICPO) and partner NII
Holdings Inc. (NIHD) are preparing to challenge America Movil SAB&#8217;s
dominance of Mexico&#8217;s wireless market after the government
concluded an auction of airwaves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies spent 180 million pesos ($14 million) to
claim 30 megahertz of national airwaves in the 1.7 gigahertz
band in an auction that ended yesterday, the Federal
Telecommunications Commission said on its website. America Movil
and Telefonica SA also won airwaves in the auction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa, the world&#8217;s largest Spanish-language broadcaster,
and NII had the sole bid for one-third of the 90 megahertz of
airwaves auctioned because they were the only participants
qualified for that spectrum under rules that limit each
company&#8217;s total holdings. NII said it will offer third-generation services such as high-speed Internet within 12 to 18
months after it receives the airwaves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The arrival of a new competitor provokes a drop in
prices,&#8221; Gustavo Cantu, vice president of NII&#8217;s Mexican unit,
said in a phone interview. NII, the smallest of Mexico&#8217;s four
mobile-phone carriers, plans to use the new airwaves to extend
its customer reach beyond its traditional niche of business
users, Cantu said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the auction that ended yesterday, America Movil spent
3.79 billion pesos to place the top bids on 30 megahertz of
airwaves in three regions of the country and 20 megahertz in six
other regions, including the area that includes Mexico City.
Telefonica SA (TEF) had the top bids on 10 megahertz of spectrum in
six regions, including the Mexico City area, spending 1.27
billion pesos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More Capacity &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new airwaves give Mexico City-based America Movil more
capacity to offer its mobile high-speed Internet plans.
Telefonica, which also won spectrum in a separate auction of 1.9
gigahertz spectrum, can begin offering 3G services across the
country for the first time. America Movil has 71 percent of
Mexico&#8217;s mobile-phone market, followed by Madrid-based
Telefonica with 21 percent, Grupo Iusacell SA with 4.4 percent
and NII with 3.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An additional 30-megahertz swath of national spectrum went
without bids because no participant was qualified under the
spectrum limit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NII plans to spend 18.9 billion pesos over six years to
upgrade and operate its Mexican network to offer new services,
the Reston, Virginia-based company said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bundled Packages &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa and NII aim to begin offering packages that
combine mobile-phone services with the voice, video and data
plans offered by the broadcaster&#8217;s satellite and cable
television units, Cantu said. Those plans should be available
before the end of 2010, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Telecommunications Commission must still review
the auction before it can officially award the spectrum to the
winning companies. If NII does receive the airwaves, the
company&#8217;s value should increase, said Walter Piecyk, an analyst
at BTIG LLC in New York, in a research note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The new spectrum both increases the potential Ebitda
growth and reduces the technology risk of the company,&#8221; Piecyk
said, referring to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NII rose 50 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $37.22 at 4 p.m. New
York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Mexico City-based
Televisa dropped 20 centavos to 47.37 pesos in Mexico City
trading, and America Movil rose 36 centavos, or 1.2 percent, to
31.33 pesos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Telefonica Threat &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1.7 gigahertz auction raised 5.25 billion pesos. That
doesn&#8217;t include 36.3 billion pesos in annual fees the winners
must pay over two decades, according to rules set by Congress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a risk that the telecommunications agency could
decide not to award NII the airwaves it won, Andres Coello, an
analyst at BBVA Bancomer SA in Mexico City, said in a research
note today. That&#8217;s because NII was the only bidder for the 30-megahertz swath, meaning it would obtain spectrum more cheaply
than its rivals, Coello said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Including the annual payments required by Congress, NII
will pay 18.3 billion pesos over 20 years if the government
awards the company the airwaves. America Movil and Telefonica
would pay a total of 23.2 billion in the same two-decade span. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks rose for a second day,
erasing earlier losses as speculation the Federal Reserve will
take steps to spur lending and an increase in building permits
sent homebuilders and commodity producers higher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lennar Corp. rose 6.3 percent and U.S. Steel Corp. gained
7.5 percent. Harley-Davidson Inc. advanced 14 percent after its
profits topped analyst estimates. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
increased 2.2 percent after reporting second-quarter earnings.
Johnson  Johnson fell the most in a month after the drugmaker
lowered its full-year earnings forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 rose 1.1 percent to 1,083.48 as of 4 p.m. in
New York after falling as much as 1.3 percent earlier. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average gained 75.53 points, or 0.7 percent, to
10,229.96 after declining as much as 1.4 percent earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market has digested the perfect storm of bad economic
and earnings news at the open,&#8221; said Art Hogan, chief market
analyst at New York-based Jefferies Group Inc. &#8220;Materials and
energy stocks are rising on a turnaround in commodity prices.,&#8221;
and &#8220;it&#8217;s knocked out one of the legs in the sell-story.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks rallied as traders speculated Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke may announce a reduction of the
interest rate the Fed pays on banks&#8217; excess reserves to
stimulate economic growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed Speculation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some people are speculating about the Fed announcing it
tomorrow when Bernanke testifies,&#8221; said Dan Greenhaus, chief
economic strategist at Miller Tabak  Co. in New York. &#8220;If you
suspend paying that money, you provide less of an incentive for
the banks to keep the money with the Fed and encourage them to
do something else with it. It will spur on the economy and could
turn the market around.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernanke will give his semiannual report on monetary policy
to the Senate Banking Committee tomorrow. He will testify at the
House Financial Services Committee on July 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homebuilders advanced after building permits, a gauge of
future construction, rose 2.1 percent last month to a 586,000
pace, propelled by a 20 percent jump in multifamily applications
that are often volatile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lennar Corp. gained 6.3 percent to $14.69. Toll Brothers
Inc. climbed 4.4 percent to $16.95. Pulte Group Inc. rallied 4.7
percent to $8.30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 has gained 6 percent since July 2 on optimism
that corporate earnings would signal the economic recovery is
sustainable. Of the 42 companies in the SP 500 that reported
from July 12 through the open of trading this morning, all but
nine beat earnings-per-share forecasts, according to Bloomberg
data. While second-quarter net income has topped analysts&#8217;
projections by 11 percent on average, revenue has been only 3.3
percent more than estimated, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple, Yahoo &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc., Yahoo! Inc. and Gilead Sciences Inc. are among
companies that posted quarterly results after the official close
of U.S. exchanges today. The maker of the iPhone rose 2.6
percent to $251.89 during regular trading. After-hours, it said
earnings per share in the third quarter were $3.51, beating the
$3.11 average analyst estimate. The company said it expects
fourth-quarter per-share profit to be about $3.44, below the
$3.83 predicted by analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple has beaten expectations in each report since 2003,
according to Birinyi Associates Inc. data. The shares advanced
4.1 percent to $262.13 in extended trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo! Inc. plunged 4.5 percent to $14.52 in trading after
the close as the owner of the second most-used search engine in
the U.S. after Google Inc. reported second-quarter sales
excluding revenue passed on to partner sites of $1.13 billion.
The average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was $1.16
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gilead Declines &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gilead dropped 2.3 percent to $32.25 after it reported
second-quarter adjusted profit of 85 cents a share after the
close of regular trading. The average analyst estimate in a
Bloomberg survey was for an adjusted profit of 87 cents a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the regular trading session, stocks rose further
when the SP 500 was able to hold levels watched by analysts who
study charts and patterns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m encouraged that support in 1,055 to 1,065 range has
put up a solid fight, the bulls are defending this range,&#8221; New
York-based technical analyst Christopher Verrone said. &#8220;After
touching 1,010 in early July, the key is for the market to start
setting &#8216;higher-lows&#8217; again and it looks like we&#8217;re headed in
that direction with today&#8217;s key reversal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodity producers rose the most of 10 industry groups in
the SP 500, rallying 2.9 percent. Cliffs Natural Resources Inc.
jumped 8.2 percent to $50.33. AK Steel Holding Corp. surged 6.7
percent to $14.41. U.S. Steel climbed 7.5 percent to $44.29. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrial Companies &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An index of industrial companies in the SP 500 rose 1.6
percent, up from an earlier loss of 1.5 percent. Caterpillar
Inc. rallied 2.5 percent to $66.43. General Electric Co. gained
2.2 percent to $14.94. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harley-Davidson, the biggest U.S. motorcycle maker, rose
the most in the SP 500, jumping 14 percent to $26.83 after
reporting profit that topped analysts&#8217; estimates. Profit from
continuing operations rose more than fourfold to $139.3 million,
or 59 cents a share, from $33.4 million, or 14 cents, a year
earlier, Milwaukee-based Harley said. Profit was expected to be
41 cents a share, the average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the most profitable firm in Wall Street
history, rose 2.2 percent to $148.91 after reporting second-
quarter net revenue of $8.84 billion. The average estimate of
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for revenue of $8.94 billion.
The shares fell as much as 2.8 percent earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM Falls &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest
computer-services company, sank 2.5 percent to $126.55. Revenue
last quarter rose 2 percent to $23.7 billion, the company said
late yesterday. Analysts on average estimated $24.2 billion,
according to a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas Instruments, the second-largest U.S. chipmaker, slid
3.1 percent to $24.77. Second-quarter profit rose to $769
million, or 62 cents a share, from $260 million, or 20 cents, a
year earlier, the Dallas-based company said after the close of
U.S. trading yesterday. Sales increased 42 percent to $3.5
billion. Analysts on average estimated profit of 63 cents a
share and sales of $3.52 billion, according to a Bloomberg
survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Housing starts fell in June to the lowest level since
October as a slump in sales following the expiration of a
government tax incentive caused U.S. builders to cut back.
Payrolls decreased in 27 U.S. states in June, led by California
and New York, signaling the slowdown in hiring is broad-based.
Employers in California cut staff by 27,600 workers last month
and those in New York reduced employment by 22,500, the Labor
Department said today in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson  Johnson lost 1.7 percent to $58.58. The health-
products company cut its 2010 earnings forecast because of a
series of drug recalls. The company said earnings excluding some
items will be as little as $4.65 a share this year, missing the
average analyst estimate of $4.80, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services company, slid in
New York trading after missing analysts&#8217; sales estimates and
reporting a drop in services-contract signings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue last quarter rose 2 percent to $23.7 billion, IBM
said. Analysts on average estimated $24.2 billion, according to
a Bloomberg survey. Currency fluctuations reduced sales by $500
million, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Services-contract signings declined 12 percent to $12.3
billion, the Armonk, New York-based company said, for the second
straight quarterly drop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market doesn&#8217;t want to hear words -- it wants to see
results,&#8221; said Edward Jones analyst Andy Miedler, who rates the
shares &#8220;buy,&#8221; citing earnings growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s outlook remains healthy, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on a conference call. Signings declined last
quarter because many customers didn&#8217;t extend contracts and some
clients put off signing them until this quarter, he said. IBM
actually increased new business signings, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I would take this and interpret it as a
reflection that there&#8217;s a pullback in spending,&#8221; Loughridge
said. &#8220;The rollover of deals should accelerate performance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outsourcing signings should have double-digit percentage
growth in this quarter, Loughridge said. Services growth, as
well as software revenue and new hardware products, will help
IBM raise total sales this quarter even with a currency impact,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forecast Boost &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM boosted its full-year profit forecast to at least
$11.25 a share, missing analysts&#8217; average estimate of $11.28.
The company had previously projected profit of at least $11.20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income for the quarter climbed 9.4 percent to $3.39
billion, or $2.61 a share, topping analysts&#8217; average estimate of
$2.58 a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company gets almost a third of its revenue from Europe,
whose currency fell 9.4 percent against the dollar last quarter.
Although the impact from foreign-exchange rates was anticipated,
not all analysts took it into account with their estimates, said
Deutsche Bank AG analyst Chris Whitmore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a headwind,&#8221; said San Francisco-based
Whitmore, who rates the shares &#8220;buy&#8221; and doesn&#8217;t own them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currency fluctuations hurt profit by about 10 cents to 11
cents a share, Loughridge said on the call. IBM also said it
would introduce its new mainframe computer, part of its System z
series, this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2015 Outlook &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano expects IBM to almost
double operating earnings to $20 per share by 2015, as he
continues to focus on more lucrative software and services
businesses. The software segment, the company&#8217;s most profitable,
will make up about half of total earnings in five years,
Palmisano has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmisano plans to make about $20 billion in acquisitions
in that period. IBM is investing in markets such as analytics
software, which helps companies predict trends, and cloud
computing, which lets them store and access information on
shared servers. The company is also developing services to
monitor highways, electrical grids and other infrastructure to
help these systems run more efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased sales of those technologies, along with growth
markets such as Brazil and China, will add $20 billion to
revenue by 2015, IBM has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM also announced a shuffling of management duties at the
company yesterday, in an e-mail distributed to employees. Four
top executives will take on additional responsibilities as
Palmisano nears 60, the usual retirement age for the company&#8217;s
CEOs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company fell $3.24, or 2.5 percent, to $126.55 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have dropped 3.3 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Viniar, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc.&#8217;s chief financial officer, said he&#8217;s &#8220;not aware of any
discussions&#8221; about changing the chief executive officer or
chief operating officer after the firm agreed to a record-
setting settlement with U.S. regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some investors and analysts have speculated that CEO Lloyd Blankfein, 55, and Gary Cohn, 49, who serves as president and
COO, may step down in coming months as the New York-based
company attempts to overcome reputational damage from the
Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s fraud lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They must know something I don&#8217;t,&#8221; Viniar, 55, said in a
telephone interview today after the bank reported an 82 percent
drop in second-quarter profit. He added that &#8220;obviously I
wouldn&#8217;t tell you if we were having board discussions about
those things.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher Whalen, a former Federal Reserve Bank of New
York official and co-founder of Institutional Risk Analytics,
said after the settlement last week that Blankfein would
probably leave &#8220;within a decent interval&#8221; in order to help
repair the company&#8217;s reputation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales Partners LLC, said
last week that he expects Blankfein and Cohn to be gone before
the end of next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will &#8220;choose a time where they can exit in a manner
that it&#8217;s not tied to the SEC issue and in a manner where they
can walk out with good news on their hip,&#8221; Peabody said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which has lost 12 percent on the New York
Stock Exchange this year, gained $2.70 to $148.38 in composite
trading at 2:27 p.m. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partner Departures &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which had about 400 partners after the firm
last named new members to the partnership in 2008, will probably
see defections before the end of the year because 15 percent to
20 percent of the partners leave every two years, Viniar said.
He estimated that about half of the 60 or 80 partners that would
be expected to leave have already gone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are going to be partners who retire,&#8221; Viniar said.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know who they are, there&#8217;s no one who&#8217;s being talked
about, there&#8217;s no one who&#8217;s talking about it. But I am sure that
between now and the end of the year there will be partners who
retire.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of money set aside for compensation in the first
half of the year dropped 18 percent even as the total number of
employees climbed 9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Legislation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm hasn&#8217;t had any &#8220;large amounts&#8221; of people leaving
because of new legislation that will affect businesses including
proprietary trading and the special-situations unit, Viniar
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That &#8220;doesn&#8217;t mean it won&#8217;t happen in the future but we&#8217;re
not seeing it now,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs agreed last week to pay $550 million to
settle the SEC&#8217;s April 16 lawsuit, which accused the firm of
defrauding investors in a collateralized debt obligation sold in
2007. A new financial regulation law that was passed by the U.S.
Senate last week will probably force changes on Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
derivatives-trading business and divisions that invest the
company&#8217;s own money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viniar, who joined Goldman Sachs in 1980, said he remains
happy at the firm. &#8220;I am here because I love Goldman Sachs and
I love what I do,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mexico&#8217;s peso gained the most in a
week as crude oil, the nation&#8217;s second-largest export, rose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peso rose 0.8 percent to 12.8046 per dollar, from
12.9021 yesterday, at 2:13 p.m. New York time. Earlier it
strengthened 0.9 percent, the most since July 13. The currency
has jumped 2.1 percent this year against the U.S. dollar, the
third-best performer among the 16 major currencies tracked by
Bloomberg, after Japan&#8217;s yen and Singapore&#8217;s dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The gain in oil at least lets you know that you are going
to have better revenue,&#8221; said Omar Martin del Campo, a trader
at Banco Ve Por Mas SA in Mexico City. &#8220;In the long term, it
helps you have better economic numbers and more stable ones.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil for August delivery rose 1.3 percent to $77.50 a
barrel. Oil is the nation&#8217;s second-largest export, after
automotive parts and vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on the 10 percent bonds due in 2024 fell three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 6.87 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the security rose
0.28 centavo to 128.53 centavos per peso. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp., the world&#8217;s
largest oil company, restarted halted units at its Augusta
refinery in Italy after a boiler fault on July 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The failed boiler, the main generator of steam at the site,
brought down oil processing units, a Rome-based spokeswoman for
Exxon said today by phone, declining to be named in line with
company policy. Most of the halted units are back in operation
after the fault, which occurred at about 5 p.m. local time and
led to flaring for a couple of hours, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery has the capacity to process 190,000 barrels of
oil a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Flaring is a
safety measure used to vent gases to prevent pressure build-up
when normal refinery operations are disrupted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should sell bullish
SanDisk Corp. options because slowing demand signals that the
biggest maker of flash-memory cards won&#8217;t extend gains after
more than doubling in a year, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity derivatives strategists Amyn Bharwani and Marko Kolanovic recommended selling October $48 calls on the
chipmaker, which has surged 124 percent from a year ago to
$41.79 as of yesterday. That&#8217;s the biggest gain among 76
technology companies in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategists cited JPMorgan semiconductor analyst
Christopher Danely, who said last week that chipmaker stocks may
retreat because inventory is increasing as demand slows, and
Harlan Sur, who assumed coverage of SanDisk July 15 with a
&#8220;neutral&#8221; rating and $50 year-end share-price forecast. That&#8217;s
$1 below JPMorgan&#8217;s prior estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are seeing multiple indications of a downturn,&#8221; San
Francisco-based Danely wrote July 12. &#8220;We do not believe the
downside is priced into the stocks and expect semis to continue
to trade off over the coming months.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based derivatives strategists also said call
selling is &#8220;attractive&#8221; because implied volatility, the key
gauge of option prices, for three-month SanDisk contracts is
higher than the stock&#8217;s historic volatility over the past month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selling a call option, which gives the right to buy a stock
at a set price and date, is a bet that the shares won&#8217;t exceed
the strike price before the contract&#8217;s expiration date, allowing
the seller to keep what the buyer paid. Milpitas, California-
based SanDisk closed at a 32-month high of $49.70 on June 17 and
isn&#8217;t likely to exceed that level before October, the
strategists wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said
second-quarter profit dropped 82 percent, missing analysts&#8217;
estimates on a slide in trading revenue five days after settling
U.S. regulators&#8217; fraud allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income fell to $613 million, or 78 cents a share, from
$3.44 billion, or $4.93, a year earlier, New York-based Goldman
Sachs said in a statement today. The average estimate of 21
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for earnings of $1.99 per
share, with estimates ranging from 77 cents to $4.34. Some of
the analysts didn&#8217;t include costs of the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s chairman and chief
executive officer, is working to restore the firm&#8217;s reputation
after agreeing to pay $550 million to settle the Securities and
Exchange Commission&#8217;s fraud accusations. The bank&#8217;s bigger
competitors, including JPMorgan Chase  Co., last week also
reported lower trading revenue as market gyrations reduced
clients&#8217; willingness to take on risk. Concern that the U.S.
economic rebound will stall and reform legislation will crimp
profits at finance companies have weighed on their stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The clouds over the financial industry remain thick,&#8221;
said Michael Farr, president and founder of Washington-based
Farr, Miller  Washington LLC, who manages more than $650
million. Farr, who sold his Goldman Sachs stock when the SEC
suit was filed on April 16, said he&#8217;s considering buying again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;ve got probably the greatest, most innovative
investment bank in the world, leading the category, which looks
cheap,&#8221; Farr said before earnings were released. &#8220;I have not
put my money back in yet but I am taking a close look at doing
just that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Share Performance &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs fell 49 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $145.68 in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, leaving the
stock down 14 percent this year through yesterday. The SP 500
Financials Index, which tracks the performance of 80 financial
company shares, is down 2 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s shares rebounded last week on news that the
firm had reached a settlement with the SEC over its 2007 sale of
a collateralized debt obligation. The cost was lower than the $1
billion some analysts had estimated and the settlement didn&#8217;t
require any management changes. Analysts slashed earnings
estimates in recent weeks on concern market declines would hurt
trading revenue as well as on costs related to the settlement
and a one-time bonus tax imposed in the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People have gotten overly pessimistic on Goldman,&#8221;
Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales Partners LLC, said
before the earnings were released. &#8220;We don&#8217;t believe they&#8217;ve
lost big chunks of their client base, and we do believe in their
risk-management capabilities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares in some of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s biggest rivals fell last
week after they reported revenue that was lower than investors
predicted. JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s second-quarter net revenue dropped 9
percent from the first quarter as revenue at the investment bank
unit slid 24 percent. Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s revenue fell 9
percent as global banking and markets revenue tumbled 38
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, which was the second-biggest securities
firm after Goldman Sachs before both converted to banks in 2008,
is due to report earnings tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors and analysts said before the earnings that
they&#8217;re keen for news on how the settlement, which imposes
changes to the way Goldman Sachs sells mortgage-related
securities, and the wider financial regulatory reform bill
passed by the U.S. Senate last week will affect earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I do think there will actually be business reforms where
their risk taking might be reined in,&#8221; said Portales Partners
LLC&#8217;s Peabody. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any question that Goldman
did play in the grey areas&#8221; and curbing that &#8220;reduces your
opportunities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

Citigroup, said by phone today. &#8220;We think Kogas is short gas in
the 2015, 2016 time frame. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if they
signed up with another one or two Australian LNG projects,&#8221; to
acquire a further 4 million metric tons a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santos Ltd.&#8217;s Gladstone LNG project and Inpex Corp.&#8217;s
Ichthys development, among more than a dozen proposed LNG
projects in Australia seeking to tap rising Asian demand for
cleaner-burning fuel, are possible sellers, Greenwood said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Korea Gas expects to purchase 1.5 million tons of LNG
annually from Wheatstone for as long as 20 years and agreed to
acquire a 5 percent stake in the gas venture, Chevron&#8217;s local
unit said today. The state-run utility in 2009 signed a pact to
buy 1.5 million tons of LNG a year from Chevron&#8217;s A$43 billion
($37 billion) Gorgon project off northwest Australia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, targets a
final decision in 2011 on whether to proceed with Wheatstone.
The Korea Gas deal &#8220;adds further momentum&#8221; to the development,
John Gass, president of Chevron Global Gas, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competing for Labor &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement with Korea Gas may be worth about A$33
billion, based on Western Australian Premier Colin Barnett&#8217;s
estimate of a previous sales deal. Chevron&#8217;s contract announced
in December to supply Tokyo Electric Power Co. with 4.1 million
tons of LNG a year was valued at A$90 billion by Barnett. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Korea Gas said in May that it had started discussions to
buy a stake in the Gladstone gas project in Queensland led by
Santos, Australia&#8217;s third-largest oil and gas producer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Australian LNG ventures are competing to obtain
customers and find workers. Australia&#8217;s resources industry faces
a shortage of 36,000 tradespeople by 2015, according to a July
15 report by a labor taskforce set up by the government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The taskforce recommended introducing new labor agreements
designed specifically for &#8220;mega&#8221; resources projects to make
hiring of labor outside Australia more efficient and proposed
five-day deadlines for completing visa applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s decision to approve the Gorgon project was the
&#8220;initial impetus&#8221; for the taskforce, the document showed.
Australia has 75 advanced resources projects worth about A$110
billion in the development pipeline, the committee said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wheatstone may generate 6,500 jobs during construction,
with first LNG shipments planned for 2016, Chevron Australia
said in a publication posted on its website. The project is
&#8220;hot on the heels&#8221; of Gorgon, Wheatstone General Manager Geoff
Strong said in May at a petroleum conference in Brisbane. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s progress may add to pressure on competitors to
attract workers, Greenwood said. &#8220;With an impressive lineup of
projects -- Gorgon being the largest resource project Australia
has ever seen -- and then Wheatstone, they are in a good
position to manage their workforce,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp., the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider, shuffled
its top management as Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano
nears 60, the usual retirement age for that position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior Vice President Mike Daniels, who heads technology
services, will now lead the consulting business as well,
Palmisano said in an internal memo sent to IBM employees
yesterday and obtained by Bloomberg News. Ginni Rometty, also a
senior vice president, will lead marketing and strategy, in
addition to her position as head of sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The restructuring could point to succession plans at IBM.
Three of IBM&#8217;s last four chief executives have stepped down at
60, and Palmisano, who has led the company for more than eight
years, will hit that mark next July. Daniels and Rometty have
been cited by analysts and former employees as two likely
candidates for the top spot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Mills, who&#8217;s headed the software group for a decade,
will take on the hardware division as well. Mills, while well-
respected for helping increase profitability in IBM&#8217;s software
division, may be unlikely to take over the top post since he
also turns 60 next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge will now also
oversee IBM&#8217;s financing division as well as its own information
technology, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Over the past several years we have seen great value in
working collaboratively,&#8221; Palmisano said in the memo. &#8220;Today&#8217;s
changes have that in common - they will further strengthen
teaming in support of our strategies and initiatives.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM spokesman Edward Barbini, who confirmed the existence
of the e-mail, declined to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM Succession &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has brought in a CEO from outside the company only
once, when it named Louis V. Gerstner Jr. to succeed John Akers
in 1993. Akers, who was forced out by IBM&#8217;s board, was the only
one of IBM&#8217;s last four chief executives to leave before 60. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last CEO change, IBM made the succession path clear
more than a year before Gerstner stepped aside. The company
appointed Palmisano, then head of the server business, president
and chief operating officer in September 2000. The formal CEO
announcement came in January 2002, and Gerstner stepped down
from the position March 1, on his 60th birthday. Gerstner
remained chairman through the end of 2002 before Palmisano
assumed that title. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc., the drugmaker cutting
costs after buying Wyeth, agreed to sell a New York skyscraper
to TIAA-CREF, said two people with knowledge of the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal for 685 Third Ave. in Midtown sets the price at
$180 million to $190 million, one of the people said. Both
declined to be identified because the transaction isn&#8217;t
complete. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal would be at least the seventh for a Manhattan
skyscraper in the past three months, showing increased
confidence among buyers that the city&#8217;s office market may have
reached bottom. U.S. commercial real estate prices rose for the
second straight month in May, Moody&#8217;s Investors Service said
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That reflects the demand and competition,&#8221; Robert Bach,
chief economist for Grubb  Ellis Co., a Santa Ana, California-
based commercial property broker, said in a telephone interview
about the Moody&#8217;s report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manhattan real estate owners sold $2.92 billion of
commercial property in the first half, up 70 percent from a year
earlier, according to preliminary data from New York-based
research firm Real Capital Analytics. About $1.42 billion of
those sales were for office buildings, up 62 percent from a year
earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, told New York
officials in April it planned to sell the 634,000 square-foot
Third Avenue tower as it consolidates operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Pfizer official declined to comment yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firing Workers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has been firing workers and shutting facilities
following its $68 billion buyout last year of Madison, New
Jersey-based rival Wyeth. It has said it will cut 19,000 jobs,
close eight manufacturing plants and eliminate six research
centers as it seeks to lower costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is also bracing to lose patent protection next year
on its top-selling product, the Lipitor cholesterol pill, which
generated $11 billion in 2009 sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2003, the New York-based drugmaker said it planned to
spend $1 billion over 15 years to expand in the city and add
jobs. Since then, it has fired 40,000 employees worldwide in
addition to the 19,000 it plans to shed after buying Wyeth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company already stopped receiving city benefits under a
deal intended to lure companies to relocate or expand in New
York. It may have to refund tax breaks and pay penalties of as
much as double the $12 million it got in public benefits, David Lombino, spokesman for the city Economic Development Corp., said
in May. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp.,
ConocoPhillips and Royal Dutch Shell Plc plan to build and
deploy a $1 billion rapid-response system to capture and contain
oil in the event of a future underwater well blowout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four companies will contribute $250 million each toward
the creation of a non-profit organization, the Marine Well
Containment Co., that will create and manage containment
equipment and responses in the Gulf of Mexico, Alan Jeffers, an
Exxon spokesman, said today in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Exxon Mobil is taking the lead on the engineering
construction phase, but the plan is to set up a non-profit
organization that will ultimately manage this,&#8221; Jeffers said.
&#8220;It&#8217;s still in the development stages, but we&#8217;re going to ask
others to join and those who choose not to join can have access
to the equipment via commercial arrangements.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc, which has been struggling to contain an underwater
oil gusher after a Gulf rig exploded in April, wasn&#8217;t listed as
a participant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our focus right now is the response to the current
situation,&#8221; Scott Dean, a BP spokesman, said in a phone
interview. &#8220;We&#8217;ve said from early on that there will be lessons
learned from this incident and we&#8217;re sure that changes will be
made in the industry.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the new initiative led by Exxon, the biggest
U.S. oil company, equipment will be designed for several
scenarios up to 10,000 feet (3,048 meters) in depth specific to
conditions in the Gulf. The system will be able to mobilize
within 24 hours and have initial capacity to contain 100,000
barrels a day, according to an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional costs for equipment, contracts and new vessels
may increase the $1 billion commitment, according to the
statement. The companies said in the statement that they have
reviewed the system with Congress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co., the world&#8217;s largest
soft-drink maker, posted a 16 percent increase in second-quarter
profit as North American sales volumes climbed for the first
time since 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income rose to $2.37 billion, or $1.02 a share, the
company said today in a statement. Excluding some items, profit
was $1.06, compared with the $1.03 average of estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. Beverage volume in North America advanced 2
percent, compared with a 1 percent decline a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The volume growth in North America, Coca-Cola&#8217;s largest
market, exceeded predictions from analysts such as Mark Swartzberg at Stifel Nicolaus  Co. Coca-Cola benefited from
marketing tied to the 2010 World Cup and from surging sales of
sports beverages like Powerade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They are having great success with their investments and
marketing,&#8221; Agata Kaczanowska, a beverage-industry analyst for
market researcher IBISWorld in Santa Monica, California, said
today in an interview. &#8220;People will invest a couple of bucks to
cool off and refresh themselves.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola gained 84 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $54.08 at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
stock has dropped 5.1 percent this year, while rival PepsiCo
Inc. gained 5.2 percent and the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index
declined 4.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola&#8217;s growth outstripped PepsiCo&#8217;s in North America,
where a drop in consumer confidence has escalated competition.
PepsiCo posted a 1 percent decline in North American volume in
the second quarter excluding the effect of a distribution deal
with Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global Results &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global sales by drink volume grew 5 percent at Coca-Cola,
with the Eurasia and Africa unit showing the fastest growth at
10 percent. Coca-Cola used the World Cup soccer tournament,
hosted by South Africa, to stage its largest marketing campaign,
covering 160 countries and attracting more customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European sales by drink volume fell 1 percent, hurt by
&#8220;ongoing challenges&#8221; in southern and eastern Europe, Coca-Cola
said. Volume growth in the Pacific region, which amounted to 6
percent in the quarter, was hampered by bad weather in parts of
China and Japan, according to the beverage maker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Consumer sentiment is still not out of the tunnel, in
terms of employment, in terms of real estate, in terms of
banking, in terms of investment,&#8221; Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Muhtar Kent said today said during a telephone call with
reporters. &#8220;We do see rays of hope.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total sales advanced 4.9 percent to $8.67 billion. A year
earlier, second-quarter profit at Atlanta-based Coca-Cola was
$2.04 billion, or 88 cents a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Purchase, New York-based PepsiCo reported a 3.4
percent drop in second-quarter profit on costs to integrate its
largest bottlers. Coca-Cola has said it plans to finish its
purchase of the North American assets of its largest bottler in
October, aiming to improve beverage profit and distribution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, buoyed by rising
revenue, set aside 37 percent more money to pay employees in the
first half of 2010 even as rivals Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s investment bank lowered their
compensation expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley allocated $7.94 billion to pay employees in
the first six months of 2010, up from $5.78 billion a year
earlier, company data show. Goldman Sachs&#8217;s first-half
compensation dropped to $9.3 billion from $11.4 billion and
JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bank set aside $5.3 billion versus $6
billion. All of the figures exclude U.K. bonus tax costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jump at Morgan Stanley, the sixth-biggest U.S. bank by
assets, is connected to an improvement in revenue during the
period that was helped by better trading results than analysts
expected, said Jeanne Branthover, managing director at
recruitment firm Boyden Global Executive Search. Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s equity trading revenue in the second quarter
outstripped all of its biggest rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They must have extremely good people in those jobs and
they&#8217;re performing,&#8221; Branthover said of New York-based Morgan
Stanley. &#8220;They&#8217;re coming out winners.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employee Ranks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three Wall Street firms added 5,125 employees in the
last year, with more than half -- 2,900 -- joining Goldman
Sachs. That contributed to a drop in average pay per employee at
Goldman Sachs to $272,581 in the first half from $364,135 a year
earlier, while Morgan Stanley&#8217;s average climbed to $126,244 from
$94,465 a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley added 20,000 employees on May 31, 2009, when
it completed a deal to combine its brokerage unit with Citigroup
Inc.&#8217;s Smith Barney. The higher first-half compensation cost
this year reflects the fact that those employees were only
counted for June in the first half of 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with the increase, Morgan Stanley is putting aside a
smaller percentage of revenue for compensation expenses compared
with 2009, as first-half revenue more than doubled. The firm set
aside 47 percent of revenue for pay costs, excluding the U.K.
bonus tax, compared with 71 percent a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s compensation costs accounted for 43 percent
of revenue, compared with 49 percent a year earlier. JPMorgan&#8217;s
investment bank set aside 36 percent in the first half, from 38
percent in the first six months of 2009. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, Tiger Management LLC Founder Julian Robertson and an heir
of Walt Disney urged Congress to reinstate a tax on
multimillion-dollar estates, possibly retroactively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three were joined by AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka
today to support efforts by a Boston-based advocacy group,
United for a Fair Economy, pressing lawmakers to act before
Congress adjourns for a month-long recess in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deaths of New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner
and at least three other billionaires this year has focused
attention on the absence of the levy, which lapsed Jan. 1. Had
they died in 2009, they would have paid as much as 45 percent on
much of their estate, depending on how their wills were
structured. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We should restore the estate tax in its entirety, and
restore it now,&#8221; Rubin, who was Treasury secretary under
President Bill Clinton, said on a conference call with
reporters. He said making the tax retroactive to cover all of
2010 &#8220;should be very seriously considered.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2001, Congress passed legislation phasing out the estate
tax over the following decade and eliminating it for 2010.
Unless Congress acts, the levy is scheduled to return in 2011,
with a top 55 percent rate that would apply to amounts of
taxable estates that exceed $1 million. &lt;/p&gt;

Salant" date="Jul 21, 2010  3:12 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-07-21/goldman-sachs-doubled-lobbying-expenses-amid-financial-revamp-sec-probe.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Doubled Lobbying Expenses Amid Financial Revamp, SEC Probe</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. doubled its
lobbying expenses as it focused on proposed financial
regulations and faced U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
charges that it misled investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Goldman, which paid $550 million last week
to settle the SEC suit, spent $2.7 million to lobby during the
first six months of 2010, more than double the $1.3 million it
spent during the same period a year earlier, according to new
congressional filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several other financial institutions also increased their
lobbying this year before congressional approval of the biggest
overhaul of financial regulation since the Great Depression. The
measure was signed into law today by President Barack Obama. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the top 10 U.S. banks ranked by assets, six reported
increases in lobbying spending between January and June compared
with the same period in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. spent $2 million, up 33 percent from
$1.5 million spent during the first six months of 2009. Wells
Fargo  Co.&#8217;s spending rose to $2.3 million from $1.4 million in
2009. Morgan Stanley spent $1.6 million, compared with $1.4
million a year earlier, though its second-quarter lobbying
expenses were lower than a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks&#8217; trade group, the Washington-based American
Bankers Association, spent $4.2 million, up from $3.9 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The increase in our lobbying expenses reflects the
additional analysis and legal support devoted to regulatory
reform and related legislation as it evolved over the last
several months,&#8221; said Shirley Norton, a spokeswoman for
Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America, the largest
U.S. bank by assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher Costs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary Eshet, a spokeswoman for San Francisco-based Wells
Fargo, said the higher lobbying costs reflected the company&#8217;s
growth following its acquisition of Wachovia Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s important to stay in tune with the conversations and
decisions that occur in Washington, D.C., because so many of
them impact our four most important stakeholders: our customers,
our shareholders, our team members and our communities,&#8221; she
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melissa Daly, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, and Mark Lake, a spokesman for New York-based Morgan Stanley, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the banks&#8217; lobbying expenses grew, their contributions
to lawmakers decreased. Bank of America&#8217;s political action
committee made $496,500 in donations between Jan. 1, 2009, and
June 30, 2010, down from $716,822 during the same 18-month
period in 2007-08. Morgan Stanley&#8217;s PAC gave $303,500, down from
$663,300 two years ago. New York-based Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s PAC
contributions fell to $499,000 from $756,600. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legislation Passed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers reluctant to take money from banks blamed for
causing the economic meltdown don&#8217;t have to worry about it now
that Obama has signed the financial regulation bill into law,
said Rogan Kersh, associate dean at New York University&#8217;s Wagner
School of Public Service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Once the bill has passed, it&#8217;s much harder for their

&lt;p&gt;Journalists call it a buried lead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s when the real story is below the newspaper fold and
drowned out by a tidbit that seems more sexy or appealing. Such
is the case with the Asian Development Bank&#8217;s latest outlook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets moved on the headline: the ADB upgraded its 2010
forecast for 14 East Asian economies to 8.1 percent from 7.7
percent projected in April. Buried was the news that three major
risks must break Asia&#8217;s way to keep prosperity alive: a double-
dip global recession, destabilizing capital flows and the
successful unwinding of stimulus measures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While most emerging East Asian economies are assured of a
sharp V-shaped recovery this year, it&#8217;s too early to say that
the V stands for &#8216;victory,&#8217;&#8221; Srinivasa Madhur, a senior
director at the Manila-based ADB, said on July 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asia has had an impressive crisis, and China&#8217;s rapid growth
is bolstering confidence in the region. China&#8217;s dynamism even
prompted Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to raise its targets for a key
index of Asian stocks. Yet Asia is moving into a precarious
period, arguably the most challenging since the late 1990s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s V stands for &#8220;valuations,&#8221; and its bet on Asian
shares makes perfect sense in the short run. In a July 14
report, analysts led by Timothy Moe raised their three-month
forecast for the MSCI Asia-Pacific excluding Japan Index to 425
from 405, increased their six-month target to 440 from 430 and
maintained their 12-month target of 485. The index is now 395. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V for &#8216;Vulnerable&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The V may really stand for &#8220;vulnerable&#8221; as U.S. growth
disappoints, investors poke and prod Europe to assess default
risks and Japan&#8217;s woes deepen. Whether healthy growth can be
maintained will depend on the decisions that policy makers take
today about Asia&#8217;s three big challenges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the global economy. The historic wave of debt
issuance over the last two years stabilized growth. It didn&#8217;t
stimulate it as hoped, and economists are talking about a return
to recession. The same goes for unprecedented interest-rate
cuts. Free money helped banks get back on their feet, but did
little to create new jobs or encourage increased consumption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble is, leaders are applying conventional thinking
to very unconventional situations. Calls in Washington for
deficit reduction ignore how comatose the biggest economy
remains. Concerns in Europe that inflation is just around the
corner overshadow the odds of deflation. Talk of recovery in
Tokyo defies reality on the ground. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Protracted Sluggishness&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the stimulus Asians threw at their economies means
little if Stephen Roach, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s non-executive chairman
for Asia, is right that the U.S. faces a period of &#8220;protracted
sluggishness.&#8221; Export-dependent Asia can live for a year
without help from a $14 trillion economy. Three or four years
would be another story. Sure, China is booming, yet a $4.3
trillion economy with an undervalued currency is no replacement
for the U.S. economic-growth engine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That gets us to challenge No. 2: hot money. Zero-interest-
rate policies in Washington and Tokyo are ricocheting around
Asia and increasing inflation risks. The U.S., Europe and Japan
are putting off finding exit strategies from post-crisis growth
stimulants. Asia doesn&#8217;t have that luxury. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As inflation pressures mount, countries from South Korea to
Malaysia are letting currencies strengthen. That approach is
more palatable for politicians since China&#8217;s move last month to
scrap its peg to the dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currencies on Move &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Now that the Chinese yuan is moving again, they can
afford stronger currencies and it&#8217;s less damaging than interest-
rate hikes,&#8221; says Simon Grose-Hodge, a strategist at LGT Group
in Singapore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dynamic may lead to additional obstacles. Overseas
investors seeking profit from the trend may rush to Asia,
swamping the region anew with short-term capital. Managing the
cash glut won&#8217;t be easy. Handled poorly, it will add to asset-
price inflation that Asia will find difficult to control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third risk -- unintended policy errors -- also looms.
This one may say the most about whether Goldman&#8217;s present
optimism translates into enduring gains for Asia&#8217;s economies and
investors in them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be challenge enough if it were just a matter of
unwinding fiscal measures. Central banks also need to mop up
untold amounts of liquidity -- much of it flowing their way
thanks to ultralow rates in the world&#8217;s biggest economies.
Politicians and monetary officials need to work together to get
the balance right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, inflation risks are heating up. On the
other, the bulk of the world&#8217;s poor live in Asia. Getting this
mix right is much easier said than done. Asia has never faced
such a delicate process of recalibrating drivers of growth.
After Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed in 2008, policy
makers turned on the stimulus and left things on autopilot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the easy part. The hard part comes as officials
work to move back to normalcy. That time is now, and getting
from &#8220;vulnerable&#8221; to &#8220;victory&#8221; could be a bumpy ride for
those depending on Goldman&#8217;s &#8220;valuations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, buoyed by rising
revenue, set aside 37 percent more money to pay employees in the
first half of 2010 even as rivals Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s investment bank lowered their
compensation expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley allocated $7.94 billion to pay employees in
the first six months of 2010, up from $5.78 billion a year
earlier, company data show. Goldman Sachs&#8217;s first-half
compensation dropped to $9.3 billion from $11.4 billion and
JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bank set aside $5.3 billion versus $6
billion. All of the figures exclude U.K. bonus tax costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jump at Morgan Stanley, the sixth-biggest U.S. bank by
assets, is connected to an improvement in revenue during the
period that was helped by better trading results than analysts
expected, said Jeanne Branthover, managing director at
recruitment firm Boyden Global Executive Search. Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s equity trading revenue in the second quarter
outstripped all of its biggest rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They must have extremely good people in those jobs and
they&#8217;re performing,&#8221; Branthover said of Morgan Stanley.
&#8220;They&#8217;re coming out winners.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three Wall Street firms added 5,125 employees in the
last year, with more than half -- 2,900 -- joining Goldman
Sachs. That contributed to a drop in average pay per employee at
Goldman Sachs to $272,581 in the first half from $364,135 a year
earlier, while Morgan Stanley&#8217;s average climbed to $126,244 from
$94,465 a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with the increase, Morgan Stanley is putting aside a
smaller percentage of revenue for compensation expenses compared
with 2009, as first-half revenue more than doubled. The firm set
aside 47 percent of revenue for pay costs, excluding the U.K.
bonus tax, compared with 71 percent a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s compensation costs accounted for 43 percent
of revenue, compared with 49 percent a year earlier. JPMorgan&#8217;s
investment bank set aside 36 percent in the first half, from 38
percent in the first six months of 2009. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley were chosen by American
International Group Inc. to arrange a Hong Kong initial public
offering of its main Asia life insurance unit, three people with
knowledge of the plan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underwriting banks will meet tomorrow with AIA Group
Ltd., AIG&#8217;s Hong Kong-based unit, to discuss its IPO, two of the
people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is
private. AIG plans to sell shares in the unit as early as this
year, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based company, which is selling assets to
repay a $182.3 billion bailout by the U.S., is revisiting plans
for a Hong Kong offering of AIA after Prudential Plc scrapped
its purchase of the unit. London-based Prudential&#8217;s $35.5
billion takeover bid for AIA collapsed on June 2 after investors
including BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments said the deal
was too costly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG last year hired New York-based Morgan Stanley and
Deutsche Bank of Frankfurt as co-global coordinators of AIA&#8217;s
IPO. It added more bookrunners including Goldman Sachs and
Zurich-based UBS AG, people with knowledge of the matter said in
February. Patricia Chua, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for AIA,
declined to comment. Spokesmen at Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs
and Morgan Stanley also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market Value &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman and Citigroup Inc. of New York earlier estimated
AIA would be worth $32 billion to $34 billion, and Morgan
Stanley estimated the value at $34 billion to $36 billion,
people with knowledge of the figures said in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIA has more than 23 million customers and offices in at
least 15 countries including China, India and Australia. The
unit had about $1.44 billion in operating profit in 2009, down
from $1.59 billion in 2008, Prudential said in a March filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Robert Benmosche has overhauled
AIA&#8217;s management, telling staff this week that he named Mark Tucker to replace former head Mark Wilson to have the &#8220;best team
on the field&#8221; for the IPO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit&#8217;s public offering would be &#8220;ready to go in the
coming months when market conditions are optimal,&#8221; Benmosche
said in a memo to staff, adding that he couldn&#8217;t speculate about
the precise timing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going on holiday might be the only
way for currency forecasters to deal with the whipsawing euro,
according to Jim O&#8217;Neill, chief global economist at Goldman
Sachs International. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has reversed its outlook for the
euro twice in two months, calling in its most recent forecast
for the dollar to weaken against the euro by January as U.S.
growth slows. In June, after the euro hit a four-year low, the
bank forecast the greenback would surge to a seven-year high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro rallied the most this year, gaining 6.9 percent
against the dollar, following Goldman&#8217;s June bearish call. After
the bank switched views July 14 to a bullish euro outlook, the
currency surged for a day before bouncing back down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Foreign exchange is the world&#8217;s biggest fruit and
vegetable store, with millions of people playing it 24 hours a
day,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said today in a radio interview with Tom Keene on
Bloomberg Surveillance. &#8220;Anybody who thinks they can get
foreign exchange right all the time should be in a lunatic
asylum.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The swings in the currency have sent the Goldman research
team on holiday, O&#8217;Neill, 53, joked, leaving the &#8220;the
experienced, aging heads&#8221; in charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s most recent forecast calls for Europe&#8217;s single
currency to fall to $1.22 in three months before rising to $1.35
in six months and $1.38 in a year, according to a research note
dated July 14. The bank&#8217;s six-month outlook takes it back to the
position it held before June 9, when it predicted the common
currency would drop to a seven-year low of $1.15 over three and
six months from a $1.35 forecast earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stress Tests &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was pretty obvious to me back in June that the markets
were getting ridiculously too bearish about the euro,&#8221; London-
based O&#8217;Neill said. &#8220;I thought we&#8217;d rally all the way up &#8216;til
Friday&#8217;s stress tests, and then we&#8217;d see the reality of what it
was afterwards.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro depreciated 0.6 percent to $1.2806 at 1 p.m. in
New York, down from the two-month high of $1.3029 yesterday, on
concern over the pace of the U.S. recovery and the financial
health of European banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I am a little bit surprised the euro is back as much as
it&#8217;s done this morning,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill, a former board member of
England&#8217;s Manchester United soccer team, said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman analysts predicted the euro may weaken this quarter
as confidence in some European governments falters and markets
await the stress tests on 91 of the region&#8217;s banks due July 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic Outlook &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many investors forget that the health of the U.S. economy
will play a significant role in the euro&#8217;s value, said O&#8217;Neill,
who&#8217;s been with the New York-based firm since 1995, when he
started as chief currency economist at Goldman Sachs
International. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The stress tests aren&#8217;t the only thing that matter for the
euro,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Probably just as important over the next few
weeks for the euro is what Bernanke has to say later today about
the implications of Fed policy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke delivers his
semiannual report on monetary policy to the Senate Banking
Committee today, and testifies to the House Financial Services
Committee tomorrow. U.S. policy makers trimmed growth forecasts
for this year and next at the Federal Open Market Committee&#8217;s
June meeting, according to minutes released July 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial jobless claims in the U.S. rose to 445,000 last
week from 429,000 in the prior period, according to a Bloomberg
survey before tomorrow&#8217;s Labor Department report. The same day,
the National Association of Realtors will say sales of existing
homes fell 9.9 percent in June, according to a separate survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;English Football&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given the disappointing evidence of the past few weeks,
Bernanke has to give some hope that he will find additional ways
of being so accommodative, possibly more, to make sure financial
conditions don&#8217;t tighten any further,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real news may come during the second testimony
tomorrow, according to O&#8217;Neill, who said the key is whether
Bernanke decides to tie monetary accommodation more specifically
to a 2 percent target for inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Bernanke has produced &#8220;very credible ideas as to
how the Fed would fight deflation,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said, as economic
challenges grow the chairman must demonstrate he knows how to
avoid the deflationary period Japan experienced in the 1990s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Fingers crossed,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said. &#8220;Otherwise, we&#8217;ll all
have to watch English football.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, is lagging rivals in regaining debt
investors&#8217; confidence after the 2008 financial crisis, trading
in credit-default swaps shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contracts on Morgan Stanley, which last month climbed to
the widest relative to its peers in more than a year, trade 55
basis points higher than those of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the
other Wall Street firm that converted into a bank after Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.&#8217;s bankruptcy almost two years ago,
according to data provider CMA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Lehman&#8217;s failure, Morgan Stanley has sought to reduce
its reliance on trading businesses by purchasing a controlling
stake in a joint venture with Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s Smith Barney
brokerage, with $1.6 trillion in client assets. Derivatives
prices signal investors remain concerned that Morgan Stanley,
which reported earnings today that beat analysts&#8217; estimates, is
most vulnerable if market confidence were to evaporate again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s basically a difference in their business model,&#8221;
said Michael Donelan, who oversees $3.5 billion of bonds as
director of trading and head portfolio manager at Ryan Labs Inc.
in New York. &#8220;Morgan has been lagging on the operating side.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley credit swaps have climbed 92 basis points
since April 15 to 214 basis points, CMA prices show. The
contracts dropped 12.5 basis points today after the earnings
report. They have fallen from a more than one-year high of 305
basis points on June 10 as investor concern eases that sovereign
debt strains in Europe will derail the global economic recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings Beat Estimates &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank reported second-quarter earnings from continuing
operations of 80 cents a share, which included a 20-cent tax
benefit, compared with a 47-cent average estimate of 21 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said
profit margins will remain &#8220;subdued&#8221; for 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley spokesman Mark Lake declined to comment on
the swaps prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in credit markets, the extra yield investors
demand to own corporate bonds instead of government debt
remained at the lowest since May. Corporate bond spreads were at
187 basis points, or 1.87 percentage points, unchanged for a
third day at the lowest since May 20, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch&#8217;s Global Broad Market Corporate Index.
Yields fell to 3.854 percent from 3.87 percent on July 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benchmark credit-default swaps indexes that gauge investor
perceptions of credit risk declined in the U.S. and Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on the Markit CDX North America
Investment Grade Index, which investors use to hedge against
losses on corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness,
fell 0.4 basis point to 109.6 basis points as of 12:16 p.m. in
New York, according to Markit Group Ltd. In London, the Markit
iTraxx Europe Index of swaps on 125 companies with investment-
grade ratings fell 5 basis points to 114.7, Markit prices show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Swaps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indexes typically decline as investor confidence
improves and rises as it deteriorates. Credit-default swaps pay
the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a swap protecting $10 million of bonds
and loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on Goldman Sachs fell 5 basis points
to 159.5 today after yesterday reporting second-quarter profit
that was below analysts&#8217; estimates, CMA prices show. Goldman
Sachs, which settled U.S. fraud charges last week by paying a
$550 million penalty, reported earnings of 78 cents a share,
below the average analyst estimate of $1.99 a share in a
Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Converted to Banks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs converted to bank holding
companies in September 2008 amid the worst financial crisis
since the Great Depression, giving the Federal Reserve
regulatory oversight over the firms and allowing them to
increase funding through deposits from retail investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both firms said at the time that they intended to increase
their base of insured deposits, viewed by investors as a more
secure form of funding than borrowing in the markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley had $64 billion in bank deposits at the end
of March, up from $36 billion as of August 2008, according to
regulatory filings. Goldman Sachs had $38.4 billion in deposits
as of March, compared with $29.1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private Bank &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley is building a private bank to offer more
products such as jumbo mortgages and structured loans to Morgan
Stanley Smith Barney clients. It has hired 100 bankers for the
new unit and may quintuple their numbers by the end of 2011, a
person with knowledge of the strategy said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors demand 260 basis points in extra yield to own
Morgan Stanley debt instead of Treasuries, 9 basis points wider
than the average for U.S. banks, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Broad market uncertainty tends to be more negative for
Morgan Stanley than it does for the commercial banks,&#8221; said
Matthew Burnell, an analyst at Wells Fargo Advisors. &#8220;And
historically, it&#8217;s less of a negative for Goldman Sachs than
Morgan Stanley.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gap in spreads between Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs
has almost quadrupled since the end of 2009, when the difference
was 15.1 basis points, CMA prices show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Should they trade that wide to Goldman?&#8221; said Ryan Labs&#8217;
Donelan, who said he expects Morgan Stanley to issue bonds soon.
&#8220;Well, the market&#8217;s telling you yeah, but we&#8217;re actually
looking at them as a buy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley&#8217;s credit-default swaps had increased 67
percent in the past quarter, nearly double the average spread
widening on North American financial companies, Fitch Ratings
said yesterday in a statement. Goldman Sachs spreads increased
32 percent and Wells Fargo  Co. contracts widened 16 percent,
Fitch said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Concerns over lingering sovereign risks, a double-dip
recession and financial reform implications have sent spreads in
the North American financial sector wider by 34 percent,&#8221;
Jonathan Di Giambattista, a managing director at Fitch, said in
the statement. &#8220;Morgan Stanley is an outlier, however.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, is lagging rivals in regaining debt
investors&#8217; confidence after the 2008 financial crisis, trading
in credit-default swaps shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contracts on Morgan Stanley, which last month climbed to
the widest relative to its peers in more than a year, trade 55
basis points higher than those of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the
other Wall Street firm that converted into a bank after Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.&#8217;s bankruptcy almost two years ago,
according to data provider CMA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Lehman&#8217;s failure, Morgan Stanley has sought to reduce
its reliance on trading businesses by purchasing a controlling
stake in a joint venture with Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s Smith Barney
brokerage, with $1.6 trillion in client assets. Derivatives
prices signal investors remain concerned that Morgan Stanley,
which reported earnings today that beat analysts&#8217; estimates, is
most vulnerable if market confidence were to evaporate again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s basically a difference in their business model,&#8221;
said Michael Donelan, who oversees $3.5 billion of bonds as
director of trading and head portfolio manager at Ryan Labs Inc.
in New York. &#8220;Morgan has been lagging on the operating side.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley credit swaps have climbed 92 basis points
since April 15 to 214 basis points, CMA prices show. The
contracts dropped 12.5 basis points today after the earnings
report. They have fallen from a more than one-year high of 305
basis points on June 10 as investor concern eases that sovereign
debt strains in Europe will derail the global economic recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings Beat Estimates &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank reported second-quarter earnings from continuing
operations of 80 cents a share, which included a 20-cent tax
benefit, compared with a 47-cent average estimate of 21 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said
profit margins will remain &#8220;subdued&#8221; for 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley spokesman Mark Lake declined to comment on
the swaps prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in credit markets, the extra yield investors
demand to own corporate bonds instead of government debt
remained at the lowest since May. Corporate bond spreads were at
187 basis points, or 1.87 percentage points, unchanged for a
third day at the lowest since May 20, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch&#8217;s Global Broad Market Corporate Index.
Yields fell to 3.854 percent from 3.87 percent on July 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benchmark credit-default swaps indexes that gauge investor
perceptions of credit risk declined in the U.S. and Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on the Markit CDX North America
Investment Grade Index, which investors use to hedge against
losses on corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness,
fell 0.4 basis point to 109.6 basis points as of 12:16 p.m. in
New York, according to Markit Group Ltd. In London, the Markit
iTraxx Europe Index of swaps on 125 companies with investment-
grade ratings fell 5 basis points to 114.7, Markit prices show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Swaps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indexes typically decline as investor confidence
improves and rises as it deteriorates. Credit-default swaps pay
the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a swap protecting $10 million of bonds
and loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on Goldman Sachs fell 5 basis points
to 159.5 today after yesterday reporting second-quarter profit
that was below analysts&#8217; estimates, CMA prices show. Goldman
Sachs, which settled U.S. fraud charges last week by paying a
$550 million penalty, reported earnings of 78 cents a share,
below the average analyst estimate of $1.99 a share in a
Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Converted to Banks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs converted to bank holding
companies in September 2008 amid the worst financial crisis
since the Great Depression, giving the Federal Reserve
regulatory oversight over the firms and allowing them to
increase funding through deposits from retail investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both firms said at the time that they intended to increase
their base of insured deposits, viewed by investors as a more
secure form of funding than borrowing in the markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley had $64 billion in bank deposits at the end
of March, up from $36 billion as of August 2008, according to
regulatory filings. Goldman Sachs had $38.4 billion in deposits
as of March, compared with $29.1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private Bank &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley is building a private bank to offer more
products such as jumbo mortgages and structured loans to Morgan
Stanley Smith Barney clients. It has hired 100 bankers for the
new unit and may quintuple their numbers by the end of 2011, a
person with knowledge of the strategy said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors demand 260 basis points in extra yield to own
Morgan Stanley debt instead of Treasuries, 9 basis points wider
than the average for U.S. banks, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Broad market uncertainty tends to be more negative for
Morgan Stanley than it does for the commercial banks,&#8221; said
Matthew Burnell, an analyst at Wells Fargo Advisors. &#8220;And
historically, it&#8217;s less of a negative for Goldman Sachs than
Morgan Stanley.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gap in spreads between Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs
has almost quadrupled since the end of 2009, when the difference
was 15.1 basis points, CMA prices show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Should they trade that wide to Goldman?&#8221; said Ryan Labs&#8217;
Donelan, who said he expects Morgan Stanley to issue bonds soon.
&#8220;Well, the market&#8217;s telling you yeah, but we&#8217;re actually
looking at them as a buy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley&#8217;s credit-default swaps had increased 67
percent in the past quarter, nearly double the average spread
widening on North American financial companies, Fitch Ratings
said yesterday in a statement. Goldman Sachs spreads increased
32 percent and Wells Fargo  Co. contracts widened 16 percent,
Fitch said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Concerns over lingering sovereign risks, a double-dip
recession and financial reform implications have sent spreads in
the North American financial sector wider by 34 percent,&#8221;
Jonathan Di Giambattista, a managing director at Fitch, said in
the statement. &#8220;Morgan Stanley is an outlier, however.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dollar Index may fall about 4
percent over the next two to three months if it breaches a
&#8220;critical support&#8221; zone, according technical analysis by
JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The index, a benchmark for the greenback&#8217;s performance
against the currencies of six trading partners, may depreciate
to around 80 if it weakens through the zone between 82 and
81.44, an area bounded by levels that represent a &#8220;sustained
breakout&#8221; in April and the 50 percent retracement of the rally
that began in November 2009, JPMorgan analyst Niall O&#8217;Connor
said in a telephone interview from New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if it consolidates for a few more
weeks before extending lower,&#8221; O&#8217;Connor said, citing an
oversold U.S. dollar. &#8220;If the dollar is able just to hold in
just at resistance levels, then it could be a two- to three-
month timeframe before we get down to those lower levels.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The index rose 0.4 percent to 83.045 at 10:13 a.m. in New
York. A decline to O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s target of 80 to 79.70 would
represent a loss of about 4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In technical analysis, investors and analysts study trading
patterns to forecast changes in a security, commodity, currency
or index. Support and resistance refer to lower and upper
boundaries, respectively, of a trading range where buy or sell
orders may be clustered. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Jesse Westbrook and Joshua Gallu" date="Jul 21, 2010 12:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-07-21/sec-s-demand-that-goldman-admit-mistake-could-spur-wall-street-lawsuits.html"><headline>SEC's Demand That Goldman Admit `Mistake' Could Spur Lawsuits</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;By forcing Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
to admit a &#8220;mistake,&#8221; U.S. regulators may be signaling a more
confrontational approach to future settlements that could expose
Wall Street to more investor lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its $550 million accord with Goldman Sachs, the
Securities and Exchange Commission deviated from its usual
practice of imposing a fine while letting a firm remain silent
on whether it engaged in misconduct. Firms that are required to
admit oversights may find it difficult to argue in private
litigation that they conceded no wrongdoing and settled purely
to end regulatory scrutiny, said Salvatore Graziano, a lawyer
who specializes in class-action suits on securities fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This makes it even harder to assert that they settled out
of convenience,&#8221; said Graziano, of Bernstein Litowitz Berger 
Grossmann LLP in New York. &#8220;Once it&#8217;s out there, it&#8217;s out
there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week&#8217;s accord between New York-based Goldman Sachs and
the SEC removed a cloud over Wall Street&#8217;s most profitable firm.
The SEC accused Goldman Sachs three months ago of selling a
mortgage security without disclosing that hedge fund Paulson 
Co. helped design the asset and was betting it would fail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Goldman Sachs still used the boilerplate language of
not acknowledging or refuting improper conduct, the company also
said it was a &#8220;mistake&#8221; that its marketing materials for the
security called Abacus 2007-AC1 included &#8220;incomplete
information.&#8221; The documents didn&#8217;t include Paulson&#8217;s role,
according to the SEC settlement. The mistake admission was
limited to the Abacus deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Major Departure&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The demand that Goldman Sachs admit an error is a &#8220;major
departure&#8221; for the SEC, said Harvey Pitt, a former chairman of
the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe this will reflect a broadside decision to
require concessions, because if that occurred, the SEC might not
be able to settle a large percentage of the cases it brings,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Given the limits of the SEC&#8217;s budget, it is clearly
not able to litigate every case it might otherwise bring.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC has about 1,400 employees in its enforcement
division, which investigates and prosecutes wrongdoing. The
entire agency operates on a budget of about $1 billion a year.
Goldman Sachs has more than 34,000 employees and earned $4
billion in the first six months of 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies and individuals that forge settlements with the
SEC benefit from not having to admit wrongdoing, because it can
limit their legal exposure, said Michael Piazza, a former SEC
lawyer. The lack of any concession gives criminal prosecutors
and private litigants nothing to build cases on, Piazza said. It
also reduces the likelihood that insurance companies will deny
paying lawyer fees on the basis that an SEC target is admitting
guilt, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;World Will Change&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;An acknowledgment of some wrongdoing or specific acts of
facts alleged could have a very different effect,&#8221; said Piazza,
who now represents targets of SEC investigations at Greenberg
Traurig LLP in Irvine, California. If the Goldman Sachs case
&#8220;portends a trend for more fulsome acknowledgements, the world
of SEC settlements will change.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs on April 16 said the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit was
&#8220;completely unfounded in law and fact&#8221; and that the agency
didn&#8217;t warn the company before announcing the case. The
Financial Times reported in April that Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd Blankfein told investors the suit may have been
politically motivated to help President Barack Obama&#8217;s
administration convince Congress to approve legislation
overhauling financial regulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those actions may have prompted the SEC to demand in the
settlement that Goldman Sachs admit the mistake, Pitt said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Vindicated&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you want to dispute the government&#8217;s allegations,
that&#8217;s fine,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But if you want to malign or impugn
the government&#8217;s motivations, that&#8217;s not fine. By extracting
that agreement, the SEC has vindicated the fact that its lawsuit
was filed for appropriate reasons.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs spokesman Michael DuVally declined to comment
on why the firm admitted to a mistake. On a call with Wall
Street analysts yesterday, David Viniar, the chief financial
officer, was asked what impact the SEC settlement will have on
any lawsuits against the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to have any material impact,&#8221;
Viniar said. &#8220;We think there&#8217;s nothing new in the settlement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC is examining other firms and a range of structured
products that fueled losses during the financial crisis,
Enforcement Director Robert Khuzami said when announcing the
settlement. SEC spokesman John Heine declined to comment on
whether any future settlements would include demands that
companies admit mistakes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Investors &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s risk of being sued in private litigation
may be limited, because the SEC complaint only listed two
investors who lost money on the Abacus transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, which purchased a company
that lost about $841 million on the mortgage security, hasn&#8217;t
ruled out filing a lawsuit, a person with knowledge of the
matter said July 16. The bank will receive $100 million as part
of the SEC settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG, which lost about $150
million on the Abacus deal, will recoup that amount from Goldman
Sachs. KfW Group, Germany&#8217;s development bank that bailed out
IKB, has said it is reviewing the SEC accord. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulatory settlement also requires Goldman Sachs to
reform its business practices. Those changes, along with new
regulations being considered by the SEC, may make it harder for
all Wall Street firms to sell opaque financial products to
banks, pension funds and governments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bolstered Compliance &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Goldman Sachs puts together a security tied to
mortgages, the product must be reviewed and approved by a bigger
group of corporate managers. The executives will be responsible
for ensuring that marketing materials don&#8217;t include omissions or
misstatements. Goldman Sachs also has to bolster compliance
training for employees who sell the securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khuzami said he hopes other firms adopt the &#8220;best
practices.&#8221; If they do, it will create obstacles to getting
some securitizations done quickly, said Cliff Rossi, a managing
director at the University of Maryland&#8217;s Center for Financial
Policy in College Park. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The more pairs of eyes you have that have to review and
sign off ahead of a deal, the more it slows things down,&#8221; said
Rossi, a former senior risk officer at Countrywide Financial
Corp., Washington Mutual Inc. and Citigroup Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s a moot point for now, because there hasn&#8217;t been much
demand for mortgage securities since the U.S. housing market
collapsed in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repackaging &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firms sold about $24 billion of these assets in the first
half of 2010, and almost all were repackagings of existing
bonds, according to newsletter Asset-Backed Alert. That&#8217;s down
from a record of about $1.2 trillion in both 2005 and 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instrument involved in the Abacus deal was a
collateralized debt obligation. CDOs are pools of assets such as
mortgage bonds packed into new securities. Wall Street firms
sell most CDOs through so-called private placements, offerings
that aren&#8217;t subject to SEC disclosure requirements because only
clients with more than $100 million of invested assets can buy
the securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC in April said it&#8217;s considering requiring issuers of
private offerings to provide disclosures equal to those
available in public sales, if investors request the information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro said the proposal reflects a
reconsideration of the regulator&#8217;s long-standing assumption that
sophisticated investors like pension funds and endowments don&#8217;t
need the same protections as individuals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The private market would be &#8220;virtually shut down&#8221; if the
SEC approves the proposal, because of increased compliance costs
said Edward Gainor, a law partner at Bingham McCutchen LLP in
Washington. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which was

that American International Group Inc. would fail, has improved
cooperation with a congressional panel. &lt;/p&gt;

&#8220;Transparency and accountability are paramount.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, posted its biggest sales gain in 2 1/2 years in
the fourth-quarter after customers purchased more personal
computers running the Windows operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income climbed 48 percent to $4.52 billion, or 51 cents
a share, exceeding the 46-cent average of analysts&#8217; estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales advanced 22 percent to $16 billion,
the company said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is benefitting from a recovery in spending as
large businesses buy new PCs and servers. The company said today
it has sold 175 million copies of the latest flagship product,
making Windows 7 the fastest-selling operating system in the
history of the Redmond, Washington-based company. Global PC
shipments jumped 21 percent last quarter, according to research
firm Gartner Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty clear that there is both a PC and server
buying cycle and Windows 7 is a winner,&#8221; said Katherine Egbert,
an analyst at Jefferies  Co. in San Francisco, who advises
buying Microsoft shares. &#8220;People are obviously buying it despite
all the hype around Apple.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft was little changed in after-hours trading after
climbing 72 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $25.84 at 4 p.m. New York
time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares have dropped 15
percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts had predicted Microsoft would have total sales of
$15.3 billion in the quarter, which ended June 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc., which competes with Microsoft in operating
systems for computers, tablets and mobile phones, reported
quarterly sales this week of $15.7 billion, topping estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renewal Rates Rise &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said operating expenses for the year starting
July 1 will be $26.9 billion to $27.3 billion, down from its
March forecast of $27 billion to $27.5 billion. Microsoft no
longer provides projections for sales and profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter unearned revenue, a measure of multiyear
contracts, was $14.8 billion, above the $14.7 billion estimate
of Heather Bellini, an analyst at ISI Group in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signs of demand by businesses for bigger purchases improved
in the quarter. Renewal rates of multiyear enterprise agreements
reached the highest rate for the year, returning to Microsoft&#8217;s
historical average of 66 percent to 75 percent, Chief Financial
Officer Peter Klein said in an interview. The company doesn&#8217;t
provide a more specific figure. Billings, a measure of future
revenue, grew 27 percent, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of agreements that have been signed but for which
customers haven&#8217;t yet been billed rose to about $15 billion,
Microsoft said. That&#8217;s from about $13.5 billion at the end of
the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;More Evidence&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue in the Windows division was $4.55 billion, above
the $4.3 billion estimate of Brent Thill, an analyst at UBS AG
in San Francisco. Microsoft Business Division sales, made up
mostly of Office software, were $5.25 billion, compared with
Thill&#8217;s $5.05 billion projection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It sounds like enterprises are buying Windows 7 and will
roll it out at some point,&#8221; said Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at
Pacific Crest Securities in Portland, Oregon, who recommends
buying the shares and doesn&#8217;t own any himself. &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen more
and more evidence of a recovery in enterprise spending.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Server software revenue was $4.01 billion. Thill had
estimated $3.85 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entertainment and Devices, the unit that includes Xbox and
mobile phones, came in at $1.6 billion in sales. Thill had
expected sales of $1.58 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online Sales &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Online Services unit had sales of $565 million, short
of Thill&#8217;s $589 million prediction. Microsoft&#8217;s Bing Internet
search engine gained a percentage point of U.S. market share in
the quarter, rising to 12.7 percent, according to ComScore Inc.
in Reston, Virginia. That compared with 62.6 percent for Google
Inc. and 18.9 percent for Yahoo! Inc., which is switching over
to using Bing&#8217;s technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global PC shipments industrywide rose 21 percent in the
second quarter, Gartner said, beating the firm&#8217;s projection of
19 percent. Intel Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest chipmaker, posted
record second-quarter sales last week and said corporate
spending is strengthening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information-technology spending will climb 7.8 percent
worldwide in 2010, according to an estimate from Forrester

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission&#8217;s internal watchdog said he will expand his probe
into whether politics drove an agency lawsuit against Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. to include the timing behind a $550 million
settlement with the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC Inspector General H. David Kotz agreed in April to a
request from U.S. Representative Darrell Issa, a California
Republican, that he probe whether politics prompted the lawsuit
against Goldman Sachs. Today, in response to another request
from Issa, Kotz said in a letter to the congressman that he will
broaden the probe to review the agency&#8217;s July 15 accord with the
New York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issa requested that Kotz examine whether there was any
political reason that the SEC&#8217;s announcement of the settlement
came two hours after the Senate approved legislation overhauling
financial regulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The commission must seek to avoid even the appearance of
applying political considerations or self-serving
grandstanding,&#8221; Issa wrote in a letter today to the SEC
inspector general. &#8220;That is why the timing of the commission&#8217;s
initial suit against Goldman, the settlement of that suit and
the public announcements of both actions have been a cause of
concern.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC sued Goldman Sachs three months ago, accusing the
firm of selling a mortgage security without disclosing that
hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped design the asset and was betting
it would fail. In the settlement announced last week, New York-
based Goldman Sachs agreed to pay a $300 million fine and $250
million as restitution to investors who lost money on the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro has said there were no political
motivations in the case against Goldman Sachs and said the White
House and Congress have no influence on enforcement actions.
Both the April lawsuit and last week&#8217;s settlement were approved
in 3-2 votes by SEC commissioners, with Schapiro siding with the
agency&#8217;s two Democrats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC spokesman John Heine declined to comment on Kotz&#8217;s
decision to expand the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chile hired JPMorgan Chase  Co,
Citigroup Inc. and HSBC Holdings Plc to arrange the country&#8217;s
first international bond sale in six years, Finance Minister
Felipe Larrain said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chile will use proceeds of the 10-year bonds to help
finance rebuilding efforts after a February earthquake, Larrain
told reporters in Santiago today. Chile will meet investors in
Los Angeles, Boston and New York next week, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government plans to sell $1 billion of the securities
in dollars and $500 million &#8220;denominated in pesos,&#8221; Chile&#8217;s
first global peso bond sale, Larrain, 52, said. Chile&#8217;s two
outstanding dollar bonds mature in 2012 and 2013. The sale aims
to set new benchmarks for Chilean issuers, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chile has been absent from the debt markets for six years
and this is our return,&#8221; Larrain said. &#8220;It&#8217;s impossible to
predict the yield because that depends on market conditions in
the moment. But we have very favorable conditions for the
issuance in dollars and that in pesos.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rendered
effective a $3 billion debt shelf filed by Chilean authorities
on June 15, he said. Chile is seeking financing for repairs
after the Feb. 27 quake caused as much as $30 billion of damage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government seeks to reduce the impact of its borrowing
on the exchange rate. Larrain declined to comment on whether the
proceeds and dollar liabilities generated by sale would be
exchanged for pesos and peso liabilities through the swap
market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highest Rating &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chile is the highest-rated sovereign borrower in Latin
America. Moody&#8217;s Investors Service in June lifted its rating to
Aa3, the fourth-highest. Standard  Poor&#8217;s ranks it one level
lower at A+ and Fitch Ratings grades it one level lower still at
A. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar-denominated debt &#8220;probably doesn&#8217;t have
tremendous appeal for traditional emerging-market investors
because it will be low yielding,&#8221; said David Bessey, who helps
manage more than $10 billion of emerging-market debt at
Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. &#8220;It will
potentially appeal more to crossover type investors looking for
relatively high-rated paper.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chile&#8217;s five-year credit-default swap spread fell four
basis points to 90 basis points today, according to CMA
Datavision in London, close to AAA-rated Austria&#8217;s 88 basis-
point spread and less than Belgium&#8217;s 106 basis points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spread on Chilean sovereign bonds has widened 24 basis
points to 136 basis points from 112 basis points on April 23,
when Larrain announced the bond sales, according to JPMorgan
indexes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chilean peso appreciated 0.8 percent against the U.S.
dollar today to 519.2 from 523.15 yesterday. It earlier reached
517 per dollar, the strongest since May 3. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell
Plc and two other oil companies will spend $1 billion to
research and build a containment system to handle deep-water oil
spills in the Gulf of Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, Shell, Chevron Corp. and ConocoPhilips will each
give $250 million to establish a non-profit organization, the
Marine Well Containment Co., to produce and manage the
equipment. The system will be designed and built over the next
12 to 18 months to handle spills of 100,000 barrels a day in
waters as deep as 10,000 feet (3,048 meters), the companies said
in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil industry has been criticized by lawmakers in the
U.S. for being unprepared to deal with deep-water accidents,
following the explosion of BP Plc&#8217;s Macondo well in the Gulf of
Mexico on April 20. The blast killed 11 people, caused the worst
oil spill in U.S. history and resulted in a six-month ban on
deepwater drilling in the Gulf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For an incident in deeper waters with higher production
levels, the response capability of containment and spill
response is proven by this incident to be inadequate,&#8221; Jim Mulva, chief executive officer of Houston-based ConocoPhillips,
said in an interview yesterday. The companies have been working
with the government for six weeks on the project, Mulva said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan may also aim to blunt punitive new government
regulations on drilling, ClearView Energy Partners LLC, a
Washington-based policy analysis firm, wrote in a note to
clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drilling Moratorium &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A six-month moratorium on deep-water drilling was issued in
May after the sinking of the Deepwater Horizon rig, which BP
leased from Transocean Ltd. A federal judge in New Orleans
rejected the ban as too broad, and Interior Secretary Kenneth Salazar responded July 12 with new drilling suspension rules
that have kept deep-water rigs idle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salazar said the six-month drilling moratorium was put in
place while the government reviews drilling safety and
industry&#8217;s ability to contain a well blowout and respond to
another oil spill. The containment system proposal is &#8220;a
beginning point with the conversation relative to how we address
those three fundamental issues,&#8221; Salazar said at a hearing of
the House Oversight and Government Reform committee today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The proposal announced yesterday is an interesting one,&#8221;
Michael Bromwich, director of Interior&#8217;s Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management, Regulation and Enforcement, said at the same
hearing. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to want to review and study it carefully.
We&#8217;ll ask for more elaboration on it from the companies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard Equipment &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new container system may become standard equipment for
offshore drillers in the U.S. and probably would be adopted in
other places around the world, wrote ClearView analysts Kevin Book, F. Chase Hutto and Amanda Fessenden. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The equipment would add costs for the industry, while also
providing potential new business for oil-service companies, the
analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Exxon Mobil is taking the lead on the engineering-
construction phase,&#8221; said Alan Jeffers, a spokesman for the
Irving, Texas-based company. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to ask others to join
and those who choose not to join can have access to the
equipment via commercial arrangement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP, based in London, isn&#8217;t participating in the containment
project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;ve certainly been informed of what the four
companies have been doing,&#8221; said Mulva. &#8220;When the Macondo
incident is ultimately resolved and the well is killed, we
expect in due time that BP will join the effort.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP&#8217;s Focus &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP summoned offshore experts in April, including some from
the four companies, to help devise ways to halt the leak after a
failed attempt to contain the gusher. The company has spent
$3.95 billion on the response as of July 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our focus right now is the response to the current
situation,&#8221; Scott Dean, a BP spokesman, said yesterday. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
said from early on that there will be lessons learned from this
incident and we&#8217;re sure that changes will be made in the
industry.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early designs are for a containment system with a tight
seal that will fit over a well near the seabed and channel oil
and gas through pipes leading to vessels at the surface that
will collect and store the fuel, according to a fact sheet
distributed by the new group. The system will be able to
mobilize in 24 hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If we all do our jobs properly, this system will never be
used,&#8221; Rex Tillerson, CEO of Exxon Mobil, said in the
statement. &#8220;The extensive experience of industry shows that
when the focus remains on safe operations and risk management,
tragic incidents like the one we are witnessing in the Gulf of
Mexico today should not occur.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, may raise its quarterly dividend for the first
time since 2008 as its cash hoard swells, data compiled by
Bloomberg suggests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This quarter, Microsoft may boost the dividend to 15 cents
a share from 13 cents, giving the company an indicated dividend
yield of 2.31 percent, according to the data. That increase
would cost the software maker about $700 million a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which will probably post its biggest sales gain
in two years when it reports fourth-quarter earnings today, had
$39.7 billion in cash and short-term investments as of March 31.
The company is looking for ways to reward shareholders after a
21 percent slide in the stock price last quarter, compared with
the 12 percent drop in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They really have to do something,&#8221; said Michael Holland,
who oversees more than $4 billion, including Microsoft shares,
as chairman of Holland  Co. in New York. &#8220;A dividend increase
is a way for the board and management to signal their overall
business is healthy.&#8221; Not doing it &#8220;would probably send an
unintended signal,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg bases its dividend estimates on seven criteria,
including a company&#8217;s dividend history and public forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same Strategy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein said in
January that he would hew closely to the strategy of his
predecessor, Chris Liddell, who stepped down as CFO last year.
The approach included holding a &#8220;target amount of cash&#8221; and
using all operating cash left after capital expenditures and
acquisitions for dividends and share repurchases, Klein said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft spokesman Pete Wootton declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heather Bellini, an analyst at ISI Group in New York,
concurs that Microsoft is likely to increase its dividend.
Microsoft has typically focused on growth in operating profit to
determine when to raise the dividend, she said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For fiscal 2010, given that we are forecasting operating
income growth of 14 percent, we would expect an increase,&#8221; said
Bellini, who advises buying the shares. Bellini also cautioned
that any change to the tax rate on dividends may dissuade
Microsoft from lifting it &#8220;materially.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will probably say fourth-quarter earnings per
share rose to 46 cents, the average of analysts&#8217; estimates
compiled by Bloomberg, from 34 cents a year earlier. Analysts
predict revenue will rise 16 percent to $15.3 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PC Demand &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gains were fueled in part by rising demand for personal
computers. Global PC sales rose 21 percent last quarter,
according to Gartner Inc. outpacing the research firm&#8217;s forecast
for a 19 percent climb. Intel Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest
chipmaker, said last week that corporate spending is increasing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some technology companies have been turning away from large
acquisitions, instead accumulating cash, which they may use for
dividends and share buybacks, according to Bloomberg analysis.
With International Business Machines Corp. and Analog Devices
Inc. already boosting payouts this year, there&#8217;s increased
pressure on other technology firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg analysis predicts increases from Maxim Integrated
Products, Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc. and Quality
Systems Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, Microsoft, with one of the biggest
cash piles among non-banking companies, has experimented with
strategies to return funds to shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Payout History &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft declared its first dividend in 2003, when it had
more than $43 billion in the bank. Less than two years later
with cash mounting, the company paid a special one-time dividend
of $3 a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft rose 69 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $25.81 at 12:34
p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares
had lost 18 percent this year before today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2006, when investors urged the company to repurchase at
least $60 billion of stock, Microsoft tried a $20 billion tender
offer for its own shares. The offer failed to generate enough
interest and investors tendered just $3.8 billion in stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is now in the middle of a $40 billion repurchase
program that runs through 2013. The company stopped repurchases
for three quarters during the economic slump to conserve cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the recession ended, many investors have shown a
preference for using the cash for payouts rather than buybacks,
Holland said. There isn&#8217;t much evidence that repurchases raise
the stock price, especially with regard to Microsoft, he said.
The stock trades in the same range as it did five years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, a dividend increase may do little to assuage
investors seeking new areas of growth now that Microsoft&#8217;s
Windows 7 operating system is out the door. Some shareholders
are concerned about the company&#8217;s declining market share in
mobile phones and Apple Inc.&#8217;s ascent in tablet-style computers,
said Tony Ursillo, an analyst at Loomis, Sayles  Co. in Boston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That may pose a threat to notebooks running Windows, said
Ursillo, whose firm owns Microsoft shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People cared about Windows 7,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They don&#8217;t
seem to care about anything else that may be going well for the
company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pacific Investment Management Co.,
the bond-fund firm that last year began a push into equities,
hired Maria Gordon from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s asset-
management unit to start an emerging-market stocks group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gordon was head of the emerging-markets equity team at
Goldman Sachs Asset Management in London, where she oversaw
about $8 billion in assets, the Newport Beach, California-based
firm said in a statement. Gordon, who plans to join in October,
will eventually run a group of four to six people and will be
based in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pimco, whose name has been synonymous with bonds since it
was co-founded by Bill Gross in 1971, is venturing into other
asset classes under Chief Executive Officer Mohamed El-Erian. In
December, the firm hired former U.S. Treasury official Neel Kashkari as head of new investment initiatives to help direct
the expansion. Pimco also hired portfolio managers Anne Gudefin
and Charles Lahr from Franklin Resources Inc. to run its first
actively managed stock mutual fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gudefin and Lahr, who are known for picking stocks they
deem cheap based on yardsticks such as per-share earnings,
started Pimco EqS Pathfinder in April. The fund has grown to
about $571 million, data from Morningstar Inc. in Chicago show.
The firm&#8217;s equity unit will offer fewer than 10 global
strategies and be guided by Pimco&#8217;s research on macroeconomic
issues, the company said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pimco also hired five executives in its equity group,
including three who will support Gudefin and Lahr on the
Pathfinder funds, according to the statement. In all, Pimco now
has about 15 professionals in its equity team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Fund &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nik Ekholm, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in London, said
Gordon left earlier this month and that Richard Flax, a
portfolio manager based in London, took over for her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gordon managed the Goldman Sachs Emerging Markets Equity
Fund from 2003 until this year. The fund rose at an average
annual pace of 8.9 percent in the five years through yesterday,
compared with 13 percent for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity fund assets overseen by Goldman Sachs&#8217; investment-
management unit fell to $125 billion as of June 30 from $150
billion at the end of March, the New York-based firm said on
July 20 when releasing results for the second quarter. Goldman
Sachs has $802 billion in its money-management unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pimco&#8217;s global focus stems in part from its &#8220;new normal&#8221;
philosophy, adopted in May 2009 to describe an era of lower
returns, higher unemployment, heightened government regulation
and a diminishing role for the U.S. in the world economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measured Growth &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pimco, a unit of Munich-based insurer Allianz SE, manages
about $1.1 trillion in assets, with more than 90 percent in
bonds. Unlike rivals such as BlackRock Inc., which added
products through a series of acquisitions, Pimco is expanding by
hiring executives and broadening teams. In an April interview
with Bloomberg Markets magazine, El-Erian said that approach
will ensure that the firm doesn&#8217;t &#8220;dilute what has served
clients well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, Pimco hired two senior executives at a new unit
that will allocate clients&#8217; money to outside funds, as well as
its own, and try to protect investors from market jolts. The
firm last year opened its first exchange-traded funds and an
advisory unit to help institutions and governments value their
holdings. ETFs hold baskets of securities, as mutual funds do,
while trading continually like stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El-Erian shares the title of chief investment officer with
Gross, who runs the world&#8217;s biggest mutual fund. The $234
billion Pimco Total Return Bond Fund advanced at a 7.7 percent
annual average over the past five years to beat 99 percent of
its peers, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Brazilian central bank&#8217;s
unexpected decision last night to moderate the pace of interest-
rate increases may ultimately be &#8220;neutral&#8221; for the country&#8217;s
stocks, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While policy makers are now expected to raise the benchmark
Selic rate more slowly, the final target hasn&#8217;t changed,
analysts led by Emy Shayo Cherman wrote in a note to clients
today. JPMorgan cut its year-end Selic prediction to 11.25
percent, saying the central bank will increase the rate to 12.5
percent in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;One of the key reasons behind our domestic overweight was
the visibility on the rate cycle,&#8221; the analysts wrote. &#8220;While
JPMorgan has changed the view on the timing of the hike, it
didn&#8217;t change the magnitude. Therefore, the practical effect on
equities should be neutral.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks tied to domestic growth, including banks and
homebuilders, remain best poised to lead Brazil&#8217;s gains, while
commodities producers are still unattractive because of global
growth concerns, JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank increased the Selic half a point to 10.75
percent yesterday, after raising it 0.75 percentage point at its
two previous meetings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. said Brazil&#8217;s
Central Bank will raise interest rates less than previously
expected after policy makers last night slowed the pace of
monetary tightening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, in a report sent to clients, said it sees the
benchmark Selic rate ending 2010 at 11.25 percent from a
previous forecast of 12.5 percent.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Policy makers will pause after a 50 basis point increase at
their next meeting in September, during the height of Brazil&#8217;s
presidential campaign, before resuming increases in the first
half of 2011 on a revival of inflationary pressures, JPMorgan
economists Fabio Akira and Julio Callegari wrote.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fairfield Greenwich Group co-founder
Walter Noel was sued by the trustee overseeing the liquidation
of Bernard Madoff&#8217;s firm as part of an amended lawsuit that
names 43 new defendants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noel and the other defendants worked with Madoff and his
firm &#8220;to commit, and exponentially expand, the single largest
financial fraud in history,&#8221; trustee Irving Picard said in the
complaint filed yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.
&#8220;Every dollar the defendants purportedly &#8216;earned,&#8217; and every
dollar they kept to unjustly enrich themselves, was stolen
money.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 72, is serving a 150-year sentence in federal
prison in Butner, North Carolina, after pleading guilty to
orchestrating the biggest Ponzi scheme in history. Fairfield
served as a marketing and investor relations arm for Bernard L.
Madoff Investment Securities LLC, helping to enable the scheme,
Picard said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairfield spokesman Thomas Mulligan, reading from a company
statement, said the decision to expand the lawsuit was
&#8220;incomprehensible&#8221; because the company is currently involved
in good-faith negotiations with Picard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Madoff trustee&#8217;s amended complaint is replete with
false, misleading and rehashed accusations,&#8221; Fairfield said in
the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. Fairfield Sentry Ltd., 09-AP-1239,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Venezuela Bankers to Face Trial on Misuse of Depositor Funds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venezuela will try eight bankers and the country&#8217;s former
securities chief on charges related to the misuse of depositor
funds, the attorney general&#8217;s office said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arne Chacon and Miguel Vaz of Banco Real Banco de
Desarrollo face charges of exploiting depositors, while Orlando
Suarez Contramaestre, Luis Suarez Montenegro and Milagros Vivas
Moncayo face charges of acting as accomplices, the attorney
general said in a statement sent by e-mail July 20. Antonio
Marquez, a former securities regulator, will also face charges
of complicity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ricardo Fernandez Barrueco, who owned four banks taken over
by the government, and Jose Camacho Uzcategui were charged with
alleged complicity in appropriating and deviating depositors&#8217;
money and undue approval of loans. Caribay Camacho de Castro,
Camacho Uzcategui&#8217;s daughter, will face trial for complicity in
the diversion of depositors&#8217; money. All nine people headed to
trial face the charge of association with delinquency, the
statement said. All will remain in jail until their trials. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook Didn&#8217;t Sign Ownership Contract, CEO Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc., facing a lawsuit from a New York man
claiming an agreement entitles him to 84 percent of the company,
is &#8220;quite sure&#8221; it never signed such a contract, Chief
Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg, speaking in a TV interview with ABC World News,
was responding to an earlier comment from Facebook lawyer Lisa
Simpson, who told a judge the company was &#8220;unsure&#8221; whether he
had signed a contract. Paul Ceglia sued Facebook and Zuckerberg
in New York state court, claiming that an April 2003 agreement
entitles him to ownership of most of the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If we said that we were unsure, I think that was likely
taken out of context,&#8221; Zuckerberg said in the interview with
Diane Sawyer. &#8220;Because I think we were quite sure that we did
not sign a contract that says that they have any right to
ownership over Facebook.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ceglia&#8217;s lawsuit calls into question provenance of the
world&#8217;s most popular social-networking site, estimated to be
worth $24.6 billion by SharesPost.com, an online marketplace for
closely held firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ceglia, a resident of Wellsville, New York, included in his
June 30 complaint a two-page &#8220;work for hire&#8221; contract, which
he claimed entitled him to control of the site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His lawyer produced a copy of the document for U.S.
District Judge Richard Arcara July 20 at a hearing in federal
court in Buffalo, New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Whether he signed this piece of paper, we&#8217;re unsure at
this moment,&#8221; Facebook attorney Simpson said in court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Argentieri, a lawyer for Ceglia, responded to
Zuckerberg&#8217;s comments yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If he thinks he can go to court and give an answer like
that -- I think it&#8217;s not possible,&#8221; Argentieri said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Squawk-Box Brokers Lose Retrial Bid on New Evidence &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former broker at Merrill Lynch  Co. and Citigroup Inc.
lost a bid to throw out his conviction for selling access to his
brokerages&#8217; internal &#8220;squawk boxes&#8221; after arguing prosecutors
hid evidence of his innocence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Mahaffy Jr., and five co-defendants found guilty
last year, asked U.S. District Judge John Gleeson in Brooklyn,
New York, to cancel their convictions, dismiss the indictment or
grant them a new trial. Gleeson denied their request in an order
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the men claim federal prosecutors withheld 27
transcripts of testimony from witnesses in a related civil
lawsuit brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Mahaffy&#8217;s lawyer, Andrew Frisch, said he discovered the
documents in December, four days after the ex-broker was
sentenced to two years in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;None of the testimony on which the motion relies even
remotely supports the proposition that it would be permissible
to sell squawk-box information to day traders so they could try
to trade ahead of block orders,&#8221; Gleeson wrote in his order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frisch said in a phone interview, &#8220;We&#8217;re very optimistic
about our appeal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mahaffy was one of three brokers convicted in April 2009 of
conspiring to sell day traders access to internal squawk boxes
used to discuss pending trades. Three former day-trading
executives at New York-based A.B. Watley Group Inc. were also
convicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gleeson has allowed the defendants, who were sentenced in
December, to remain free during an appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defense lawyers argued that the government withheld
documents showing that more than 10 brokerage employees said in
depositions that what was said on the squawk boxes wasn&#8217;t
confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said the transcripts wouldn&#8217;t have altered the
verdict. The SEC testimony wasn&#8217;t favorable to the defendants,
was immaterial and wouldn&#8217;t have cleared them of wrongdoing, the
government said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day traders were accused of using information overheard
on the intercoms to trade shares ahead of larger institutional
transactions, prosecutors said at trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Mahaffy, 05-cr-00613, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BP Judge Asked to Compel Details of Gulf Spill Fund &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc should be required to specify in writing how it will
fund, protect and replenish a $20 billion fund dedicated to
paying cleanup and damage claims from the Gulf of Mexico oil
spill, lawyers suing the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP should produce &#8220;any and all trust documents, escrow
agreements or other formation documents or agreements to which
BP is a signatory&#8221; relating to two funds BP agreed to
establish, the lawyers said in a motion filed July 20 with U.S.
District Judge Carl Barbier in New Orleans. Barbier is presiding
over more than 30 spill-damage cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One fund is the $20 billion spill-claims escrow account
administered by New York lawyer Kenneth Feinberg, and the other
is a $100 million companion fund to aid oilfield workers hurt by
a U.S. offshore drilling moratorium imposed after the spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No one, it seems, has ever seen a document signed off on
by BP,&#8221; Steve Herman, an interim liaison lawyer appointed by
Barbier to coordinate claims, said in a statement released by
his office yesterday. &#8220;What, specifically, has BP committed to
do, and what, specifically, has BP given Mr. Feinberg the
authority to agree to do on behalf of BP?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP faces more than 300 lawsuits, including proposed class
actions, claiming potentially billions of dollars in damages to
commercial fishing interests, tourist businesses and property
owners harmed by the drifting oil. The spill was caused by the
sinking of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, leased by BP, off
the Louisiana coast in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herman said lawyers have been trying to clarify details of
how BP&#8217;s claims funds will work ever since the escrow accounts
were announced June 16 in a joint press release issued by the
White House and BP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said a telephone conference late yesterday with BP&#8217;s
lawyers failed to produce documents detailing specifics of BP&#8217;s
agreements. He said BP has been applying agreements he
negotiates on behalf of the New Orleans cases throughout the
company&#8217;s claims-payment process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP&#8217;s Houston media relations personnel didn&#8217;t return a call
yesterday seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re: Deepwater Horizon, 2:10-cv-01156, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEC&#8217;s Demand That Goldman Admit &#8216;Mistake&#8217; Could Spur Lawsuits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By forcing Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to admit a &#8220;mistake,&#8221;
U.S. regulators may be signaling a more confrontational approach
to future settlements that could expose Wall Street to more
investor lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its $550 million accord with Goldman Sachs, the
Securities and Exchange Commission deviated from its usual
practice of imposing a fine while letting a firm remain silent
on whether it engaged in misconduct. Firms that are required to
admit oversights may find it difficult to argue in private
litigation that they conceded no wrongdoing and settled purely
to end regulatory scrutiny, said Salvatore Graziano, a lawyer
who specializes in class-action suits on securities fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This makes it even harder to assert that they settled out
of convenience,&#8221; said Graziano, of Bernstein Litowitz Berger 
Grossmann LLP in New York. &#8220;Once it&#8217;s out there, it&#8217;s out
there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC accused Goldman Sachs three months ago of selling a
mortgage security without disclosing that hedge fund Paulson 
Co. helped design the asset and was betting it would fail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Goldman Sachs still used the boilerplate language of
not acknowledging or refuting improper conduct, the company also
said it was a &#8220;mistake&#8221; that its marketing materials for the
security called Abacus 2007-AC1 included &#8220;incomplete
information.&#8221; The documents didn&#8217;t include Paulson&#8217;s role,
according to the SEC settlement. The mistake admission was
limited to the Abacus deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs spokesman Michael DuVally declined to comment
on why the firm admitted to a mistake. On a call with Wall
Street analysts yesterday, David Viniar, the chief financial
officer, was asked what impact the SEC settlement will have on
any lawsuits against the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to have any material impact,&#8221;
Viniar said. &#8220;We think there&#8217;s nothing new in the settlement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transocean Employees Become Focus of BP Investigators &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transocean Ltd. employees onboard the Deepwater Horizon
drilling rig when it exploded in the Gulf of Mexico have become
the focus of a U.S. government probe into the cause of the fatal
disaster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Bertone, chief engineer on the rig, and Mike
Williams, chief engineer technician, were designated as parties
of interest July 20 by a joint U.S. Coast Guard-Interior
Department investigative panel. That boosted to five the number
of Transocean workers who could face criminal charges stemming
from the accident that killed 11 people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one from BP Plc, which leased the Deepwater Horizon to
drill the Macondo well, or from other companies involved in the
work has been named a party of interest, according to the
panel&#8217;s website. Transocean, the largest offshore oil driller,
may be held liable because under maritime law the vessel owner
has ultimate responsibility for the safety of those onboard,
said Paul Sterbcow, an attorney representing Williams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He later declined to comment on Williams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guy Cantwell, a spokesman for Switzerland-based Transocean,
declined to comment on the details of the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nine corporate entities have been designated as parties of
interest by the panel. They are BP and its partners in the well,
Anadarko Petroleum Corp. and Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., which
is 70 percent-owned by Japan&#8217;s Mitsui  Co.; Transocean;
Halliburton Co.; Cameron International Corp.; Weatherford
International Ltd.; M-I Swaco; and Dril-Quip Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fourth round of hearings is scheduled for Aug. 23-27 in
Houston. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York, Ohio Funds Seek Lead in BP Investor Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public pension funds of New York and Ohio asked a
Louisiana court to appoint them as lead plaintiffs in a
securities class-action lawsuit against BP Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company and some officers and directors are responsible
for the loss in share value since the April explosion and
sinking of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico,
according to a complaint in federal court in Lafayette,
Louisiana, filed on behalf of BP investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two state pension funds lost $229.4 million in BP
investments, New York Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli and Ohio
Attorney General Richard A. Cordray said July 20 in court
papers. The funds asked that similar cases against BP be
consolidated with the Ohio and New York plaintiffs as leads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The states&#8217; funds are the best choice &#8220;by virtue of the
enormous loss they suffered from their investments in BP as a
result of the defendants&#8217; misconduct,&#8221; they said in court
papers. &#8220;New York and Ohio have an extremely large financial
interest in this litigation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company and its management &#8220;made false and misleading
statements regarding BP&#8217;s safety protocols, operations, and
safety record, as well as its ability to respond to a major oil
spill,&#8221; the funds said in yesterday&#8217;s filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Ludlow v. BP Plc, 6:10-cv-00818, U.S. District
Court, Western District of Louisiana (Lafayette). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;L&#8217;Oreal Heiress Wants to Block Use of Butler&#8217;s Tapes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L&#8217;Oreal SA heiress Liliane Bettencourt asked a Paris court
to block a news website&#8217;s use of recordings that sparked a
political scandal and led police to question a member of
President Nicolas Sarkozy&#8217;s government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bettencourt&#8217;s right to privacy trumps the freedom of the
press claimed by the website, Mediapart, her lawyer told the
Paris appeals court. A lower court was wrong to allow the
recordings, made by Bettencourt&#8217;s former butler of conversations
she had with friends and advisers, to be used because of their
news value, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The right to privacy &#8220;is fundamental in French law,&#8221;
Bettencourt&#8217;s lawyer Thierry Marembert said in court yesterday.
&#8220;These conversations were of a personal nature,&#8221; including
several with another of her lawyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tapes, made between May 2009 and May 2010, were turned
over to Bettencourt&#8217;s only child, who gave them to police. They
appeared on Mediapart in June, just before a trial over the
daughter&#8217;s claims her mother was manipulated into giving away a
billion euros ($1.28 billion) in gifts to a photographer friend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial over Bettencourt&#8217;s daughter&#8217;s claims was
postponed indefinitely to investigate the recordings on July 1.
That same day the lower court in Paris ruled to allow the
recordings&#8217; use by Mediapart, saying removing the items from the
website &#8220;would restrain journalists&#8217; ability to effectively
fulfill their mission in an excessive and unjustified way.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil Court Rules Madoff Suit to Be Tried Locally, Valor Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Brazilian court ruled that a lawsuit against Banco
Santander SA in Miami over losses tied to investments in Bernard
Madoff&#8217;s funds will be tried in the South American country,
Valor Economico reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision by the Sao Paulo state court may clear the way
for other Brazilians who are suing over Madoff&#8217;s funds in Miami
to bring their cases to Brazil, Valor said. The Madrid-based
bank can appeal the decision, Valor said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helaine Rosa Saab and four of her children sued Santander,
claiming the bank invested her late husband&#8217;s money without his
consent in a fund that fed Madoff&#8217;s funds, Valor said. The
investment dwindled to less than $141,000 in February 2009 from
$647,555 in 2002, Valor said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santander won&#8217;t comment on matters still in court, the
company told Bloomberg News in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black Freed From Prison After Posting $2 Million Bond &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conrad Black, the ex-Hollinger International Inc. chairman,
was freed from prison after posting a $2 million bail bond
guaranteed by a family friend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black, 65, yesterday left the Coleman Federal Correctional
Institution, where he had been since March 2008, prison
spokesman Gary Miller said. Black will be free as he appeals
mail fraud and obstruction of justice convictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Amy J. St. Eve in Chicago set the bail
amount yesterday and said Black isn&#8217;t permitted to leave the
U.S. at this time. He must make his way to Chicago for a July 23
hearing at which the judge will instruct him on terms of his
release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;His home is in Canada,&#8221; defense attorney Miguel A.
Estrada told St. Eve at this morning&#8217;s bail hearing, seeking
greater freedom for his client. The judge said she would
consider it after seeing a Black financial statement and hearing
from a pretrial services officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black earlier this week won the right to bail from a
federal appeals court, based on a June 24 Supreme Court
decision. The high court narrowed the scope of a law prosecutors
used to convict him. The court ordered the Chicago-based appeals
court to reconsider its prior ruling upholding the conviction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black and three associates were found guilty of stealing
$6.1 million from Hollinger International as they engineered
sales of its assets. Black was sentenced to 6 1/2 years on the
obstruction of justice charge and received a five-year
concurrent sentence for fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial court case is U.S. v. Black, 05-cr-00727, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago). The
appellate case is U.S. v. Black, 07-4080, U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Seventh Circuit (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cantor&#8217;s Lutnick Says U.K. Carbon Unit Made No Money &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Howard Lutnick, chairman of Cantor Fitzgerald LP, said that
its U.K. carbon credits brokerage was a money-losing failure,
with business projections based on dreams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cantor is suing Stephen Drummond, a former executive at the
brokerage, in London for the return of $2 million it says it
lent him while he was running the unit, CantorCO2e. Drummond is
countersuing, claiming he was wrongfully dismissed in 2009 for
failing to tell the company he was in talks with a competitor
about a job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lutnick said on the witness stand yesterday that since
Drummond left, Cantor has been trying to turn Drummond&#8217;s
operation into revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We can&#8217;t figure out how to make money from it,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;The pipeline that Mr. Drummond talked about was a dream. None
of Mr. Drummond&#8217;s projections came true.&#8221; The business was
built on a &#8220;giant series of ifs,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CantorCO2e and EcoSecurities, the competitor Drummond was
in discussions with, both manage projects that receive Certified
Emission Reduction credits under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cantor fired Drummond a few months after providing the loan
when it discovered he had been meeting with EcoSecurities.
Drummond claims he was wrongfully dismissed, and says he doesn&#8217;t
owe the company money, because the $2 million was paid to him in
exchange for his shares when Cantor bought the business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Cantor Fitzgerald LP v. Stephen Drummond and
Stephen Drummond v. CantorCO2e Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swiss Tax Case of Two UBS Clients Must Be Reheard, Court Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switzerland&#8217;s Federal Administrative Court lifted an order
by tax authorities authorizing the transfer of UBS AG bank data
to the U.S. regarding two of the bank&#8217;s clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swiss tax authorities failed to hear the two plaintiffs
before issuing the order, the court said in a July 15 ruling
published yesterday. The court sent the matter back to the tax
office that must give the plaintiffs an opportunity to comment
and then issue a new decision, according to the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a pilot case earlier this week, the court said that an
agreement with the U.S. to transfer data on as many as 4,450 UBS
accounts is binding and rejected a bid to block sending account
information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month the Swiss parliament approved the 2009 agreement
with the U.S., elevating it to the status of an official state
treaty. That treaty will also govern the tax office&#8217;s decision
in yesterday&#8217;s case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After realizing its mistake, the tax office tried to revoke
the order. The tax agency will now review yesterday&#8217;s case and
any decision will be guided by the pilot case ruling, said Roger
Braunschweig, a tax administration official. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS spokesman Dominique Gerster declined to comment. The
bank clients weren&#8217;t indentified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s case is: A-3786/2010. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brookfield&#8217;s A$110 Million Wembley Accord Approved by Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brookfield Multiplex Group&#8217;s A$110 million ($97 million)
settlement with about 120 individual and institutional
investors, who claimed they lost money because the company
failed to disclose losses at London&#8217;s Wembley Stadium, was
approved by the Federal Court of Australia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brookfield Multiplex, an Australian unit of Toronto-based
Brookfield Asset Management Inc., didn&#8217;t admit to any wrongdoing
in agreeing to settle the lawsuit, the company said in a
statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a major win for the investors,&#8221; Andrew Watson,
lawyer with Maurice Blackburn, who represented the plaintiffs,
said in a statement on the firm&#8217;s Web site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement is the third to surpass the A$100 million
level under Australia&#8217;s class-action regime and is about 20
times greater than the investors would have obtained under an
offer Brookfield Multiplex made in 2007, Maurice Blackburn said
in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stress tests will provide stability
for European lenders and clarity for investors, spurring a rally
in bank debt, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strategist Alberto Gallo says that the cost of insuring
financial company debt with credit-default swaps will drop to
match that of corporate bonds for the first time since January.
The CHART OF THE DAY shows Gallo&#8217;s forecast that the Markit
iTraxx Financial Index of swaps and the corporate Markit iTraxx
Europe Index will converge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate bonds are historically more expensive to insure
than bank debt. That relationship was reversed amid concern the
brunt of Europe&#8217;s government deficit crisis would be borne by
lenders, with the financial gauge exceeding the investment-grade
index by a record 60 basis points on June 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Stress tests and other policies coming through are likely
to increase transparency and stability in the financial
system,&#8221; Gallo, who first made the forecast July 13, said in an
interview from New York. &#8220;We see the ratio of iTraxx Financial
and iTraxx Europe going to one.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements. A basis point on
a contract protecting 10 million euros ($12.8 million) of debt
from default for five years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. unit sued
to overturn a $20.5 million arbitration award to creditors of
the failed hedge fund firm Bayou Group LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the
independent regulatory group for the securities industry, on
June 24 issued the decision in favor of Bayou&#8217;s creditors in an
arbitration targeting Goldman Sachs Execution and Clearing LP
for its role as the prime broker and clearing broker for Bayou&#8217;s
hedge funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creditors claimed the unit facilitated the fraud
committed at Stamford, Connecticut-based Bayou, which filed for
bankruptcy protection in May 2006. Bayou co-founder Samuel Israel pleaded guilty to directing a $400 million fraud and is
serving 22 years in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In rendering its award, the arbitration panel manifestly
disregarded the law and exceeded its authority,&#8221; Goldman said
in its complaint filed today in federal court in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Rich, a lawyer who represented the Bayou unsecured
creditors in the arbitration, said the grounds for overturning
an arbitration award are very narrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think it&#8217;s completely without basis,&#8221; Rich said. &#8220;We
look forward to recouping the full award to the Bayou
creditors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel is incarcerated at the same federal prison complex
in North Carolina where Bernard Madoff is serving a 150-year
sentence for orchestrating the biggest Ponzi scheme in history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Israel&#8217;s 20 year sentence for the fraud, the
court added two years for faking his suicide and disappearing on
the day he was to begin his sentence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Goldman Sachs Execution  Clearing LP v.
Official Unsecured Creditors&#8217; Committee of Bayou Group LLC, 10-
CV-5622, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, posted record fourth-quarter revenue after the
most successful debut of its flagship operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales gained 22 percent, the biggest quarterly increase in
more than two years, to $16 billion, the company said yesterday.
Net income topped analysts&#8217; predictions, as did revenue for the
division that sells Windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expectations for Microsoft&#8217;s results ran high after
quarterly reports this month from Intel Corp. and Apple Inc.
blew away analysts&#8217; projections. Still, sales at Microsoft&#8217;s top
three businesses exceeded estimates. The company also said it
has sold 175 million copies of Windows 7 since the program&#8217;s
October release, the fastest pace for its main operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was a big beat,&#8221; said Sandeep Aggarwal, an analyst at
Caris  Co. in San Francisco who recommends buying the stock.
&#8220;Street expectations have only gone up in the last two, three
weeks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue in the Windows unit rose 44 percent to $4.55
billion, topping the $4.3 billion projection of Brent Thill, an
analyst at UBS AG in San Francisco. Business division sales,
made up mostly of Office software, were $5.25 billion, above his
$5.05 billion estimate. Microsoft released a new version of
Office during the quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Server software sales of $4.01 billion topped Thill&#8217;s $3.85
billion estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft fell 3 cents to $25.81 on the Nasdaq Stock Market
at 4 p.m. New York time. It has lost 15 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Falling Behind? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities in
Portland, Oregon, said he expected the shares to rise on the
results. The stock may be held back on investor concern that
Microsoft is falling behind in areas like mobile-phones and
tablet computers. He said his clients are less focused on
results from Windows and Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All I can conclude is that shareholders are just not
interested in paying for Windows and Office earnings,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;If the stock is not going to move on this, what&#8217;s it going to
take to make it move?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter net income climbed 48 percent to $4.52
billion, or 51 cents a share, exceeding the 46-cent average of
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Analysts had predicted
Microsoft would have total sales of $15.3 billion in the period,
which ended June 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple, which competes with Microsoft in operating systems
for computers, tablets and mobile phones, reported quarterly
sales this week of $15.7 billion, topping estimates. Intel, the
world&#8217;s biggest chipmaker, posted record second-quarter sales
last week and said corporate spending is strengthening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiyear Contracts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s fourth-quarter unearned revenue, a measure of
multiyear contracts, was $14.8 billion, above the $14.7 billion
estimate of Heather Bellini, an analyst at ISI Group in New
York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signs of demand by businesses for bigger purchases improved
in the quarter. Renewal rates of multiyear enterprise agreements
reached the highest for the year, returning to Microsoft&#8217;s
historical average of 66 percent to 75 percent, Chief Financial
Officer Peter Klein said in an interview. The company doesn&#8217;t
provide a more specific figure. Billings, a measure of future
revenue, grew 27 percent, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from agreements that have been signed but for which
customers haven&#8217;t yet been billed rose to about $15 billion,
Microsoft said. That&#8217;s from about $13.5 billion at the end of
the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile Competition &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholders may remain unimpressed by Microsoft&#8217;s
successes, with the company facing accelerating competition in
mobile and tablet devices from Apple and Google Inc., Barnicle
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Ballmer, Microsoft&#8217;s chief executive officer, said in
June that the company &#8220;missed a whole cycle&#8221; in mobile-phone
software, underscoring the company&#8217;s challenges from rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales in the Online Services unit fell short of Thill&#8217;s
prediction. Still, the Bing Internet search engine gained a
point of U.S. market share in the quarter, rising to 12.7
percent, according to ComScore Inc. in Reston, Virginia. Google
had 62.6 percent, followed by 18.9 percent for Yahoo! Inc.,
which is switching over to using Bing&#8217;s technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All these threats may not be anywhere near as big as what
they are perceived to be,&#8221; Barnicle said. &#8220;But it&#8217;s perception
that moves the stock.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Dina Bass and Jonathan Browning" date="Jul 23, 2010  4:21 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-07-23/arm-surges-after-microsoft-accord-signals-it-may-replace-intel-in-tablets.html"><headline>ARM Surges After Microsoft Accord Signals It May Replace Intel in Tablets</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;ARM Holdings Plc rose the most in
almost two years in London trading after announcing a licensing
deal with Microsoft Corp. that may give its technology a shot at
replacing Intel Corp.&#8217;s chips in new Windows tablet computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARM, whose chip designs are already in Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPad,
will expand the use of its technology in Microsoft devices, the
Cambridge, England-based company said today in a statement. ARM
shares rose 12 percent to 353.3 pence, the biggest jump since
October 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While ARM and Microsoft have worked together since 1997,
the new deal lets Microsoft build a customized ARM processor,
said Sarah Friar, an analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in San
Francisco. That sets the stage for Microsoft&#8217;s computer partners
to offer new kinds of tablet devices that may be more capable of
rivaling the iPad. Until now, Windows tablets have struggled to
find customers, capturing less than 2 percent of the personal-
computer market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, said the ARM deal
will apply to a &#8220;broad range&#8221; of areas, without disclosing
terms of the agreement. Microsoft declined to comment beyond the
statement. Tom Beermann, a spokesman for Santa Clara,
California-based Intel, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Momentum of ARM&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This announcement speaks to the momentum of ARM and our
position in the industry,&#8221; Antonio Viana, executive vice
president of sales and business development for ARM, said in an
e-mail. &#8220;This creates a bountiful choice of hardware and
software suppliers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple&#8217;s iPad is doing well in part because it turns on
instantly and has a long battery life, Friar said. Microsoft can
more easily match that with an ARM chip than an Intel one, she
said. Its latest PC operating system, Windows 7, doesn&#8217;t work
with ARM chips -- though its mobile and embedded operating
systems do. Microsoft is adapting its embedded version of
Windows, currently used in machines like cash registers, to work
on tablets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple, based in Cupertino, California, sold 3.27 million
iPads last quarter, outselling all other types of tablet
computers. The device debuted April 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 80 percent of the world&#8217;s PCs run Microsoft
operating systems on Intel processors. Both companies have been
unable to parlay that dominance into success in mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To remedy that, Intel has produced a scaled-down version of
its PC chip called Atom. It is working to get the processor into
mobile devices that use Google&#8217;s Android software and Intel&#8217;s
own operating system, called Meego. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel shares fell 9 cents to $21.69 at 4 p.m. New York time
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Microsoft declined 3 cents to
$25.81. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SA and NII Holdings
Inc., seeking to challenge America Movil SAB in Mexico, will
learn within three weeks whether their bid for mobile-phone
airwaves will pass muster with regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government&#8217;s airwave auction appears to have met its
goals of boosting competition and providing capacity to the
wireless industry, Mony de Swaan, president of Mexico&#8217;s Federal
Telecommunications Commission, said yesterday in an interview.
The agency must review the results carefully, in part because
Televisa and NII would get airwaves at a discount, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NII, which operates the Nextel brand in Latin America,
needs the airwaves to cement its partnership with Televisa, the
world&#8217;s largest Spanish-language broadcaster. Televisa plans to
spend $1.44 billion to buy one-third of NII&#8217;s Mexican unit if
the wireless company gets the spectrum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The ultimate end of these tenders was to foment
competition: Were those conditions satisfied? I think so,&#8221; de
Swaan said by phone from Mexico City. &#8220;But I frankly reserve my
position until I discuss it with my colleagues and we arrive at
a collegial conclusion.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency must deliberate carefully, because it will
probably have to defend its decision in court if companies
challenge the ruling, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa gained 27 centavos to 47.88 pesos at 2 p.m. New
York time in Mexico City trading. Reston, Virginia-based NII
gained 40 cents, or 1 percent, to $39.58 in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chosen Leader &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De Swaan, 40, was named by President Felipe Calderon as one
of the telecommunications agency&#8217;s five commissioners in June,
replacing Hector Osuna. The commissioners, who vote among
themselves to elect a president, chose de Swaan earlier this
month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The auction of 90 megahertz of airwaves in the 1.7
gigahertz band drew four participants, including the NII-
Televisa partnership. America Movil, Latin America&#8217;s largest
wireless carrier, spent 3.79 billion pesos ($298 million) to
place the top bids on 20 megahertz of spectrum across the
country and an additional 10 megahertz in three regions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telefonica SA, Mexico&#8217;s second-biggest wireless carrier
after America Movil, spent 1.27 billion pesos to get 10
megahertz of spectrum in six regions. Grupo Iusacell SA, the
third-biggest wireless operator, didn&#8217;t place any high bids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NII, Mexico&#8217;s smallest wireless carrier, and Televisa
offered 180 million pesos for 30 megahertz of spectrum
nationwide, the same amount of airwaves America Movil and
Telefonica spent a combined 5.1 billion pesos to acquire. NII
and Mexico City-based Televisa were able to win the airwaves
with a much lower offer because they were the only qualified
bidders for that piece of spectrum under rules that capped the
total airwaves each participant could own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not Frightened &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference in prices &#8220;doesn&#8217;t necessarily frighten
me,&#8221; de Swaan said. Including annual payments required by
Congress, NII and Televisa will pay 18.3 billion pesos over 20
years for the airwaves it&#8217;s acquiring. America Movil and
Telefonica will pay a total of 23.2 billion pesos in the same
two-decade span. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sometimes this kind of difference is desirable,&#8221; de
Swaan said. &#8220;That&#8217;s simply because there are different network
investments, because there are different economies of scale and
because part of the intent of these tenders was precisely to
promote the entry of a new participant in the industry.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NII, which has 3.6 percent of Mexico&#8217;s mobile-phone
subscribers, said this week it plans to spend 18.9 billion pesos
over six years to upgrade and operate a new mobile-phone network
capable of high-speed Internet downloads, offering consumers
technology that is now available only from America Movil and
Iusacell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile-Phone Market &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America Movil had 71 percent of Mexican mobile-phone
customers at the end of March, followed by Telefonica&#8217;s 21
percent and Iusacell&#8217;s 4.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa said it intends to package the video, Internet and
phone services offered by the satellite and cable companies it
controls with NII&#8217;s wireless plans to attract Mexican consumers.
If the companies are awarded their airwaves, they would begin
offering plans together by the end of this year, Gustavo Cantu,
a vice president of NII&#8217;s Mexico unit, said this week in an
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each commissioner of the telecommunications agency must
decide whether to void the auction results or approve them, and
each will have to offer a rationale for his vote, de Swaan said.
The agency won&#8217;t retroactively change the auction rules, since
that would &#8220;send an awful message&#8221; to investors in Mexican
companies, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase 
Co. are among the banks that sold Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
protection against a failure of insurer American International
Group Inc., said two people with knowledge of the transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG, Credit Suisse Group AG and Morgan Stanley
are also among banks that helped Goldman Sachs hedge against the
risk of an AIG collapse, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the contracts were private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has turned over a list of counterparties to
the Congressional Oversight Panel and Financial Crisis Inquiry
Commission, which are reviewing the use of taxpayer funds in
financial bailouts, according to people with knowledge of the
matter. Had AIG been allowed to fail in 2008, instead of
receiving a government rescue that swelled to $182.3 billion,
the banks may have had to make payments to Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;AIG didn&#8217;t go down, and these banks didn&#8217;t have to pay
out to Goldman for the protection they sold,&#8221; said Ed Grebeck,
chief executive officer of Stamford, Connecticut-based debt-
consulting firm Tempus Advisors and an instructor at New York
University on derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucas van Praag, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment. Renee Calabro of Deutsche Bank,
Credit Suisse&#8217;s Duncan King, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s Mark Lake,
JPMorgan&#8217;s Brian Marchiony and Citigroup&#8217;s Danielle Romero- Apsilos had no comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mortgage-Linked Securities &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG&#8217;s rescue was designed to prevent a wider financial
collapse. Banks including Goldman Sachs bought $62.1 billion in
insurance on mortgage-linked securities from AIG. To protect
itself against the possibility AIG would be unable to honor its
obligations, Goldman Sachs bought credit-default swaps that
would&#8217;ve paid out in the event of an AIG bankruptcy, Goldman
Sachs Chief Financial Officer David Viniar has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked in March 2009 which firms sold Goldman Sachs the
protection, Viniar said it was &#8220;really all of the large
financial institutions&#8221; in and outside the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That would be who you&#8217;d get protection from,&#8221; Grebeck
said. &#8220;You&#8217;d go to big, highly rated counterparties like
that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs got $12.9 billion after AIG&#8217;s rescue as
bailout funds helped the insurer honor its contracts with Wall
Street firms. The bank&#8217;s hedges against AIG were a reason
Goldman Sachs wouldn&#8217;t accept anything less than full payment on
the guarantees it purchased from the insurer, Viniar said last
year, without indentifying the firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We want to know the identity of those parties, partly
just to know where American taxpayer dollars went, but partly to
assess Goldman&#8217;s claim,&#8221; said Elizabeth Warren, chairman of the
Congressional Oversight Panel, in a Senate hearing this week.
&#8220;We cannot evaluate the credibility of their claim that they
had nothing at stake one way or the other in the AIG bailout.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An agreement may be reached as soon as the coming week,

Disney, the world&#8217;s largest media company, is attracted to the
growth of mobile games and mobile media, Steve Wadsworth, head
of the Internet unit, said in a July 1 interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Playdom is the biggest guy left that&#8217;s independent that&#8217;s
not crazy expensive,&#8221; said Michael Pachter, a Los Angeles-based
analyst with Wedbush Morgan Securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Friedland, a spokeswoman for Burbank, California-
based Disney, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mountain View, California-based Playdom raised $33 million
in June, from venture capital groups including Disney-backed
Steamboat Ventures, which invests in digital media, consumer and
technology companies. The funding brought the total raised by
the company to $76 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playdom announced a content partnership with Disney&#8217;s ESPN
sports cable channel in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney rose 54 cents to $34.13 today in New York Stock

&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. and Credit Suisse
Group AG were among banks that sold the most protection to
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. against a failure of American
International Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs stood to receive $1.7 billion in payments
from credit-default swaps had AIG defaulted, according to the
list of 148 counterparties released yesterday by U.S. Senator
Charles Grassley&#8217;s office. Citigroup could have owed more than
$400 million to Goldman Sachs, and Credit Suisse&#8217;s payment could
have been about $310 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs turned over the list of counterparties to the
Congressional Oversight Panel and Financial Crisis Inquiry
Commission, which are reviewing the use of taxpayer funds in
financial bailouts. AIG received a government rescue in 2008
that swelled to $182.3 billion, averting a collapse that may
have forced the banks to make payments to Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;AIG didn&#8217;t go down, and these banks didn&#8217;t have to pay
out to Goldman for the protection they sold,&#8221; said Ed Grebeck,
chief executive officer of Stamford, Connecticut-based debt-
consulting firm Tempus Advisors and an instructor at New York
University on derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among companies that had agreements with Goldman Sachs as
of Sept. 15, 2008, was a division of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc., which declared bankruptcy that day. The Lehman division
could have been obliged to pay about $175 million to Goldman
Sachs if AIG collapsed, according to the document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was Goldman Hedged? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Does this undermine Goldman&#8217;s claim that it was &#8216;fully
collateralized and hedged&#8217; with regard to the risk of an AIG
default, and thus demonstrate that Goldman did, in fact, receive
a direct benefit from the government&#8217;s assistance to AIG?&#8221;
Grassley wrote on his website. He is the ranking Republican on
the Senate Finance Committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the 148 counterparties are separate divisions of the
same parent company. The list includes 17 different funds
managed by Pacific Investment Management Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five biggest counterparties on the list are Citigroup,
Credit Suisse, a division of Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase 
Co.&#8217;s London branch, and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc.
Not all of the counterparties were banks -- the Government of
Singapore Investment Corp., which manages more than $100 billion
of the nation&#8217;s foreign reserves, is on the list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies or funds that purchased the most protection
against an AIG default from Goldman Sachs are listed as HSBC
Holdings Plc&#8217;s U.S. bank unit, UBS AG&#8217;s London branch, Och-Ziff
Capital Management Group&#8217;s OZ Master Fund Ltd., Royal Bank of
Scotland Plc&#8217;s London branch, and Claren Road Credit Master
Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Exposure &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have said since AIG&#8217;s problems became public that we
had no material economic exposure to AIG and the information
released today makes that point,&#8221; Lucas van Praag, a spokesman
for Goldman Sachs in New York, said on July 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG&#8217;s rescue was designed to prevent a wider financial
collapse. Banks including Goldman Sachs bought $62.1 billion in
insurance on mortgage-linked securities from AIG. To protect
itself against the possibility AIG would be unable to honor its
obligations, Goldman Sachs bought credit-default swaps that
would&#8217;ve paid out in the event of an AIG bankruptcy, Goldman
Sachs Chief Financial Officer David Viniar has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked in March 2009 which firms sold Goldman Sachs the
protection, Viniar said it was &#8220;really all of the large
financial institutions&#8221; in and outside the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That would be who you&#8217;d get protection from,&#8221; Grebeck
said. &#8220;You&#8217;d go to big, highly rated counterparties like
that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG&#8217;s Rescue &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shannon Bell, a Citigroup spokeswoman, declined to comment,
as did Duncan King of Credit Suisse, Brian Marchiony of JPMorgan
and Kimberly Macleod of Lehman. Mark Lake, a Morgan Stanley
spokesman, didn&#8217;t immediately return phone and e-mail messages
left after regular business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs got $12.9 billion after AIG&#8217;s rescue as
bailout funds helped the insurer honor its contracts with Wall
Street firms. Goldman Sachs received $8.1 billion tied to swaps
contracts and $4.8 billion for securities lending contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grassley also released a list of 32 counterparties to
Goldman Sachs on collateralized debt obligations. Goldman Sachs
made payments to banks including Germany&#8217;s DZ Bank AG and Banco
Santander SA of Spain for mortgage-related losses as it received
funds through the AIG rescue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest payments were to European lenders that also
included the London branch of Rabobank Nederland NV, Zuercher
Kantonalbank and Dexia Bank SA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Taxpayer &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The majority of these beneficiaries appear to be foreign
entities,&#8221; Grassley wrote in a set of questions directed at
Elizabeth Warren, chairman of the Congressional Oversight Panel,
and published on his website. &#8220;Can you please explain how
ensuring that these institutions were paid in full, rather than
required to suffer the consequences of the risks that they took,
benefited the U.S. taxpayer?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs executives including Viniar and Chief
Operating Officer Gary Cohn had defended the collection of funds
after AIG&#8217;s bailout, saying the money helped the firm pay
offsetting contracts with other parties. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Dawn Kopecki and Dakin Campbell" date="Jul 26, 2010  7:05 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-07-26/gift-from-fed-stops-as-profits-shrink-at-banks-led-by-jpmorgan.html"><headline>Gift From Fed Stops as Profits Shrink at Banks Led by JPMorgan</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve&#8217;s policy of
keeping interest rates persistently low, which has helped boost
bank earnings over the last six quarters, is beginning to make
it harder for the biggest U.S. lenders to make money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firms including JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Bank of America
Corp., which have benefited from record low costs of funding
mortgages and other assets, face a squeeze on their net interest
margins -- the difference between what they pay to borrow money
and what they get for loans and on securities. Analysts say the
margins may have peaked in the first half and that banks will
struggle to replace high-yielding assets as they pay off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed&#8217;s near-zero target rate for interbank overnight
lending that has buoyed profits for so long will have an
opposite effect in coming quarters, said Christopher Whalen, a
Federal Reserve Bank of New York analyst in the 1980s and co-
founder of Institutional Risk Analytics in Torrance, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s the gift from the Fed,&#8221; Whalen said of the rate.
&#8220;But at the same time, the cash flow on your assets eventually
starts to re-price and match the low-rate environment. The zero-
rate environment is eventually bad for everybody.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net interest margins fell by 26 basis points to 3.06
percent at New York-based JPMorgan from the first to second
quarters, 17 basis points at Citigroup Inc. to 3.15 percent and
16 basis points at Bank of America to 2.77 percent, according to
company reports. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Massive Issue&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reduced margins, along with lower lending volumes,
translated to a drop in net interest income of $1.02 billion at
JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets and the largest
by market value. Net interest income fell $849 million at Bank
of America, the biggest lender by assets, and $522 million at
New York-based Citigroup, which is third. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a massive issue for the industry, impacting banks at
different timing,&#8221; said Matt O&#8217;Connor, an analyst at Deutsche
Bank AG in New York. &#8220;The universal banks -- Bank of America,
Citi and JPMorgan -- are feeling the pressure now and will
continue to feel pressure for the foreseeable future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Moynihan, 50, chief executive officer of Charlotte,
North Carolina-based Bank of America, told analysts on a July 16
conference call that the &#8220;sustained low-rate environment&#8221; was
hitting revenue and earnings and will continue to affect
margins. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, 54, told analysts the day
before that the bank&#8217;s net interest margin will continue
&#8220;coming down a bit as we reposition the portfolio.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co., the fourth-biggest bank, reported that
net interest margin increased by 11 basis points to 4.38 percent
in the second quarter, which the bank said was the result of
higher-than-expected income from soured mortgage loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By lowering its target rate to almost zero in 2008, the Fed
helped save many banks from collapse. The move reduced the
industry&#8217;s average cost of funding mortgages and other interest-
earning assets to 1.03 percent in the first quarter of this
year, the lowest rate on record according to the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., from 3.58 percent in the third quarter of 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it also depressed the yield banks earn on their
investments and loans to 4.86 percent from 6.93 percent over the
same time period, the net interest margin hit a seven-year high
of 3.83 percent in the first quarter, according to the most
recent FDIC data available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed Signals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed has signaled that slowing inflation and a sluggish
economy will push any interest-rate increase into 2011. It said
in a June 23 policy statement that &#8220;underlying inflation has
trended lower&#8221; and repeated a pledge to keep the benchmark
interest rate near zero for &#8220;for an extended period.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The language led most economists polled by Bloomberg to
predict the Fed won&#8217;t raise rates until the second quarter of
next year. Futures traded on the CME Group Inc. exchange showed
a 37.6 percent likelihood yesterday that the benchmark lending
rate will be raised in April 2011. That likelihood was 55
percent a month ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Once you get into this low-rate environment for 12 to 18
to 24 months, somewhere in there assets start re-pricing to the
lower interest-rate environment,&#8221; said Marty Mosby, a Memphis,
Tennessee-based analyst with Guggenheim Partners LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks, reluctant or unable to lend, are shrinking their
balance sheets. That&#8217;s starting to eat into cash flow at the
biggest lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;No Loan Demand&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s balance sheet was reduced by $121.8 billion in
the second quarter to $2.01 trillion, which is also down from a
peak of $2.25 trillion in the third quarter of 2008. Citigroup&#8217;s
total assets fell by $64.6 billion in the second quarter to
$1.94 trillion. Wells Fargo&#8217;s total assets, which were up $2.2
billion from the first quarter to $1.23 trillion in the second,
have fallen from a peak of $1.31 trillion in December 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s no loan demand, and long-term rates have declined
so much,&#8221; Deutsche Bank&#8217;s O&#8217;Connor said. &#8220;So as you look out
over the next few quarters, it&#8217;s a potentially very dire
situation for the overall industry.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loans generate some of the highest yields for banks, said
Jason Goldberg, an analyst at Barclays Capital in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In an environment where loan growth is tough to come by,
it&#8217;s a tough challenge,&#8221; Goldberg said in an interview. &#8220;When
your highest-yielding asset isn&#8217;t there to put on the balance
sheet, it&#8217;s tough.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldberg said banks are getting squeezed as the yield
curve, which charts the difference between rates on short- and
long-term debt, flattens out. The spread between yields on
three-month Treasury bills and 30-year Treasury bonds fell to
387 basis points July 23, down from 471 basis points January 11,
the highest level in at least a decade, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regional Banks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because most banks tend to fund their long-term investments
such as 30-year mortgages with short-term debt, they benefit
when short-term rates are lower and make less money when short-
and long-term rates come closer together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Generally, the steeper the curve, the better,&#8221; Goldberg
said. &#8220;It&#8217;s steep by historical standards, but it&#8217;s not as
steep as it was earlier this year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regional banks won&#8217;t start feeling the pain until later
this year or early next year, partly because their reliance on
deposits for funding has insulated them from broader market
shifts, O&#8217;Connor and other analysts said. The average rate paid
on checking-account deposits was 0.53 percent on July 13, the
lowest level since February 2005, according to Bankrate.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Hit the Floor&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve hit the floor in deposits, you can&#8217;t go any lower,
and your asset yields are declining,&#8221; said Nancy Bush, a bank
analyst and co-founder of NAB Research LLC, an Annandale, New
Jersey-based independent research firm. &#8220;So there&#8217;s only one
way to go for the margin, and that&#8217;s down.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PNC Financial Services Group Inc. said its cost of deposits
in the second quarter fell to 71 basis points from 81 basis
points in the first quarter and 125 basis points a year ago.
Those lower funding costs won&#8217;t be enough to offset the yields
the Pittsburgh-based bank is earning from securities, mortgages
and credit cards, Chief Financial Officer Richard Johnson told
analysts on a July 22 conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This downward trend reflects the continuing migration of
the portfolio to lower-risk asset classes, such as U.S. Treasury
and U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, along with the
impact of the lower-rate environment,&#8221; Johnson said. &#8220;Yields
on securities will continue to decline as we replace maturities
and prepayments with lower-risk securities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson said the bank, the sixth-largest by deposits in the
U.S., will generate lower yields and profit margins in the
second half of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When banks can&#8217;t find yielding assets and their book is
shrinking, the cash flow on their book is shrinking,&#8221; said
Whalen of Institutional Risk Analytics. &#8220;Everybody&#8217;s starving
to death.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest provider of computer services, is
being investigated by the European Union over claims it abused
its dominant position in the market for mainframe computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probe will review claims IBM linked sales of its
hardware to its software for mainframe computers and that IBM
discriminated against competing sellers of services for the
computers, the Brussels-based European Commission said in a
statement today. IBM said the probe was the result of a campaign
by &#8220;proxies&#8221; of competitors led by Microsoft Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission, the antitrust regulator for the 27-nation
EU, said the probe is partially in response to a complaint by T3
Technologies Inc., which Microsoft invested in. T3 makes
software that transfers mainframe functions to servers that can
run Microsoft&#8217;s Windows operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as IBM has shifted away from hardware to focus on
software and services, the mainframe has remained of central
importance to the company. Though IBM gets less than 4 percent
of its revenue directly from selling mainframes, the machines
help generate sales of software, services and financing.
Altogether, the contribution is almost a quarter of IBM&#8217;s sales
and 40 percent of its profits, Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi wrote in a report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, based in Armonk, New York, said in a statement that
&#8220;there is no merit to the claims being made by Microsoft and
its satellite proxies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Probes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Certain IBM competitors which have been unable to win in
the marketplace through investments in fundamental innovations
now want regulators to create for them a market position that
they have not earned,&#8221; IBM said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frank Shaw, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft, said in an e-mail that the company invests in startup
companies such as T3 to give customers greater choice. The
company isn&#8217;t a party to T3&#8217;s complaint against IBM, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We do share T3&#8217;s belief that there needs to be greater
openness and choice for customers in the mainframe market,&#8221;
Shaw said. &#8220;Customers tell us that they want greater
interoperability between the mainframe and other platforms.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM added 3 cents to $128.41 in New York Stock Exchange
trading. Microsoft rose 29 cents to $26.10 in Nasdaq trading in
New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU has previously punished U.S. technology companies,
including Microsoft, in antitrust cases. Last year, Intel Corp.
was fined a record 1.06 billion euros ($1.37 billion) and
ordered to stop using illegal rebates to thwart competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T3 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft last year settled an antitrust case with the EU
over its Internet Explorer browser and has previously paid fines
of 1.68 billion euros in EU probes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case was triggered by T3 and another vendor, Turbo
Hercules, and involves IBM&#8217;s alleged tying of mainframe hardware
to its operating system, the commission said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T3, a company that builds mainframe computers and is
mentioned in the CCIA&#8217;s report, made a similar complaint against
IBM to the commission. Similar antitrust claims the company made
against IBM in a New York court were dismissed in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re pleased that the commission has taken this
important step,&#8221; said Dave Anderson, a lawyer representing T3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second probe involves complaints of discriminatory
behavior by IBM against competing suppliers of maintenance
services for the computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The commission has concerns that IBM may have engaged in
anti-competitive practices with a view to foreclosing the market
for maintenance services,&#8221; the EU today said in a statement,
&#8220;in particular by restricting or delaying access to spare parts
for which IBM is the only source.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newest Mainframe &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM began developing mainframe computers in the 1940s and
1950s and is now among the few companies to offer the systems.
The company announced its newest mainframe, the zEnterprise,
last week. The model, up to 60 percent faster than its
predecessor, uses IBM software to integrate it with smaller
server computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company comes out with a new mainframe every two to
three years. After the introduction of the last five models,
sales in its services division, more than half its total
revenue, rose an average of 3 percent, Deutsche Bank analyst
Chris Whitmore wrote in a report. Excluding the 2008 update,
which came during a recession, the boost is 9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mainframe, along with services and software growth,
will help IBM raise total sales this quarter even with a
currency impact, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said
this month. Last week, IBM reported second-quarter sales that
climbed 2 percent to $23.7 billion, with a $500 million hit from
currency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argentine government securities
linked to the nation&#8217;s economic growth have become a &#8220;buy&#8221; to
JPMorgan Chase  Co. and RBC Capital Markets even after a two-
month rally drove their value up to the highest since November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The warrants, which pay holders when the expansion exceeds
government projections, jumped to 9.45 U.S. cents at 4:45 p.m.
New York time from 6.8 cents at the end of May after the
statistics institute said growth quickened to its fastest pace
in six quarters in the January-through-March period. This month,
JPMorgan raised its 2010 expansion forecast to 8.5 percent,
which would be the most since 2007, as commodity exports and
government spending rise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The warrants are &#8220;going to keep appreciating,&#8221; said
Vladimir Werning, an economist with JPMorgan in New York. He
began recommending them to investors last month. They&#8217;re &#8220;a
long-term buy,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The securities may return almost 50 percent by December
2011, when they&#8217;re next eligible to pay out, based on estimates
by JPMorgan and Bulltick Capital Markets. The warrants are the
&#8220;best investment story&#8221; in all of emerging markets and could
rise to 12 cents after Argentine benchmark dollar bond yields
fell to a three-month low of 10.54 percent following the
government&#8217;s restructuring of $12.9 billion of defaulted debt,
said Alberto Bernal, head of fixed-income research at Bulltick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick Chamie, global head of emerging markets research at
RBC Capital Markets in Toronto, predicts the warrants may rise
to as high as 11.5 cents this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Weird Asset&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annual payments on the securities are triggered when growth
is above 3 percent and the inflation-adjusted value of the
country&#8217;s GDP surpasses the government&#8217;s base-case scenario laid
out in the warrant contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argentina attached the warrants to bonds it gave creditors
in a 2005 restructuring of $95 billion of defaulted debt. Within
months, the warrants, which mature in 2035, started trading
separately. President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner issued more
of the securities in the settlement last month with creditors
who rejected the 2005 offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a weird asset,&#8221; said Bernal. &#8220;It&#8217;s not necessarily
a bond, but close to it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warrant holders will receive no payment this year because
the economy expanded 0.9 percent in 2009 as the global recession
crimped demand for the country&#8217;s soybean, wheat and corn
exports. Argentine overseas sales fell 20 percent last year to
$55.7 billion before rebounding 11 percent in the first quarter,
according to the statistics institute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas Shortages &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government made a warrant payment of 3.11 cents on Dec.
15 after South America&#8217;s second-biggest economy grew 6.8 percent
in 2008. Werning predicts a payout of 4.32 cents in 2011. Bernal
forecasts payments of 4.5 cents next year and 6.5 cents in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The bottom line is that in the next two payments, you
already recover all of your initial investment,&#8221; Bernal said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBS Securities Inc. recommends investors wait for a decline
in the warrants before purchasing them. While predicting the
securities will climb to 13 cents over the next year, RBS said
they may slide in coming months after the recent surge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There will be another opportunity to buy on weakness,&#8221;
Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America strategy at RBS in
Stamford, Connecticut, wrote in a July 23 report. &#8220;It will not
likely be a linear trajectory&#8221; higher, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas shortages sparked by a record cold winter may curb
growth, said Neil Shearing, senior emerging markets economist at
Capital Economics Ltd in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Hard Landing&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dow Chemical Co., the world&#8217;s second-largest chemical
maker, closed one of its ethylene plants and has another working
at minimum capacity because of the shortages, Soledad Echague,
the Midland, Michigan-based company&#8217;s public affairs director in
Argentina, said in a July 19 phone interview from Buenos Aires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argentina may face a &#8220;very hard landing,&#8221; Shearing said
in a telephone interview. He forecasts growth of 4 percent this
year and 1.5 percent in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to hold Argentine dollar
bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries fell 36 basis points to 682,
according to JPMorgan&#8217;s EMBI+ index. The spread has dropped
three straight weeks, the longest streak since March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of protecting Argentine debt against non-payment
for five years with credit-default swaps fell 75 basis points
last week to 845, according to data compiled by CMA DataVision.
Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
government or company fail to adhere to its debt agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record Sales &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peso fell 0.1 percent to 3.9326 per dollar, extending
its loss this year to 3.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economy Minister Amado Boudou said July 15 that growth will
be &#8220;at least&#8221; 6 percent this year, up from an earlier estimate
of 5 percent. The government boosted spending 32 percent in the
first half of the year to 180.4 billion pesos, according to the
Economy Ministry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argentina&#8217;s economic activity gauge, a proxy for gross
domestic product, jumped 12.4 percent in May from a year
earlier, the government said July 16. The increase topped the
median 9.1 percent estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists
and is the biggest since March 2004. Vehicle sales climbed to a
record 61,000 units in June, the Auto Manufacturing Association
said July 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Growth forecasts in Argentina look quite strong,&#8221; said
RBC&#8217;s Chamie, who predicts an expansion of as much as 7 percent
this year. &#8220;That&#8217;s helping the fundamental value&#8221; of the
warrants, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. can&#8217;t transfer
a loan obligation of Grupo Televisa SA&#8217;s cable unit to a bank
controlled by billionaire Carlos Slim, a federal judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal judge in New York in February initially halted
the transfer after Empresas Cablevision SA complained that
assigning the loan to Slim&#8217;s Banco Inbursa SA might reveal
Cablevision&#8217;s confidential information to a rival cable company
owned by Slim. JPMorgan then complained Empresas Cablevision
breached a credit agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parties agreed to the order after JPMorgan said it
would repurchase from Inbursa the 90 percent interest in the
loan, Televisa said today in a statement. U.S. District Judge
Jed Rakoff, in the order dated July 23, also barred JPMorgan
from sharing information with Inbursa regarding private
information received from Cablevision related to the loan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is an important decision both for the enforcement of
borrower&#8217;s veto rights under credit agreements and for requiring
financial services institutions to act responsibly on behalf of
their customers,&#8221; Salvi Folch, chief financial officer of
Televisa, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank, had asked Rakoff to
order Cablevision to consent to assigning 90 percent of the $225
million loan to Banco Inbursa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Televisa unit got the loan in December 2007 to buy
Bestel SA, which operated a fiber-optic network in Mexico.
JPMorgan originally intended to syndicate the loan but didn&#8217;t do
so in 2008 because of the deteriorating credit market, according
to Rakoff&#8217;s earlier ruling. Last year, the bank started efforts
to sell the loan to Inbursa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Slim didn&#8217;t immediately return phone and
e-mail messages. Justin Perras, a spokesman for JPMorgan,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Empresas Cablevision v. JPMorgan, 09-9972, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combination of growing
confidence in Europe&#8217;s economy and mounting evidence of a
slowdown in the U.S. is driving euro bears into hiding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After tracking the euro&#8217;s slide from about $1.45 at the
beginning of 2010, the median forecast of currency strategists
has stayed within two cents of $1.20 since the start of June,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and Wells Fargo  Co. raised their estimates in the past
two weeks, joining HSBC Holdings Plc and Deutsche Bank AG in
predicting a stronger euro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the euro weakened 15 percent in the first half as the
region&#8217;s debt crisis threatened to tear the currency union
apart, investors have shifted their focus to the U.S. as the
dollar depreciated 8 percent from a four-year high in June. U.S.
economic data fell short of economists&#8217; estimates this month by
the most since March 2009, while euro-region reports exceeded
forecasts since April, according to Citigroup Inc. indexes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People got a bit too excited about the idea the euro-area
was going to break up and forgot that the U.S. has a whole load
of problems of its own,&#8221; said David Bloom, global head of
currency strategy at HSBC in London, who has predicted since the
start of June that the euro would end the year at $1.35. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confidence in the euro returned after the most-indebted
countries in the region announced budget cuts and the European
Union crafted a 750 billion-euro ($970 billion) financial
backstop in May to forestall defaults. Spain, Portugal, Ireland
and Greece successfully auctioned more than 17 billion euros of
bonds and bills since July 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic Outperformance &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculation the recovery would accelerate increased when
Germany&#8217;s Ifo institute said July 23 that its business climate
index unexpectedly jumped to the highest level since July 2007.
A composite index of European services and manufacturing
industries climbed to 56.7 in July from 56 the month before,
London-based Markit Economics said a day earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors showed little surprise on July 23, when the
Committee of European Banking Supervisors said seven of 91 EU
banks subject to stress tests failed with a combined capital
shortfall of 3.5 billion euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro rose 0.5 percent to $1.2974 as of 11:30 a.m. in
New York, after appreciating in three of the past four weeks.
The 16-nation currency appreciated 9 percent since June 7, when
it slid to $1.1877, the weakest level since March 2006. It also
advanced 2.6 percent since falling to a more than seven-year low
on June 29, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency
Indexes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outlook Reversed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts are raising their forecasts as Citigroup&#8217;s euro-
region economic surprise index reached a three-year high of 131
on May 27. The equivalent U.S. gauge fell to a 16-month low of
minus 43.6 on July 1. The measures examine historical standard
deviations of data surprises by comparing releases with
Bloomberg median estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs analysts led by Thomas Stolper in London
reversed their outlook for the euro twice in two months, and
said in the most recent forecast that the dollar will weaken
against the euro by January as U.S. growth slows. The New York-
based bank says the shared currency will reach $1.22 in three
months, $1.35 in six months and $1.38 in a year. As recently as
June, Goldman Sachs forecast the dollar would surge to a seven-
year high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weaker Growth &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Weaker U.S. growth, reasonably solid euro-zone macro data
and less political-fiscal disruptions than feared have been a
feature of the past few weeks,&#8221; Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in
the report dated July 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, raised its six-month
euro forecast to $1.24 from $1.20 on July 14, said Vassili Serebriakov, a currency strategist in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The main positives for the euro have been stronger-than-
expected euro economic numbers and a recovery in risk
appetite,&#8221; he said. Serebriakov said the euro will weaken
longer term, falling to $1.18 in 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While U.S. growth has slowed more than forecast, the
economy will still outpace Europe over the coming year as budget
cuts start to brake the recovery, said Ian Stannard, a senior
foreign-exchange strategist in London at BNP Paribas SA. The
Paris-based lender scaled back its forecast for a decline in the
euro on July 23, saying it will fall to $1.12 in the first
quarter, from a previous prediction of parity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Still in Place&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The reasons why a weaker euro are both likely and needed
are still in place,&#8221; said Stannard. &#8220;The market still hasn&#8217;t
really adjusted to the prospect of lower euro-zone growth once
the fiscal tightening that has been announced is implemented and
begins to bite.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. economy will expand 3.1 percent this year,
according to the median of 55 analyst forecasts compiled by
Bloomberg. The euro-region will grow 1.1 percent, a separate
median estimate shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German Chancellor Angela Merkel&#8217;s Cabinet approved four
years of budget reductions and revenue programs worth 81.6
billion euros on July 7. Greece aims to cut its budget deficit
to 8.1 percent of gross domestic product this year, from 13.6
percent in 2009, and meet the EU&#8217;s 3 percent limit by 2014.
Portugal plans to reach the EU target by 2012, reducing it from
9.4 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro-region deficit will narrow to 6.1 percent of GDP
in 2011 from 6.6 percent this year, according to European
Commission forecasts on May 5. The U.S. gap will hit 10 percent
in 2010 and 9.9 percent next year, the figures show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While European governments are pruning, U.S. President
Barack Obama signed into law a $34 billion extension of
unemployment benefits on July 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasury Yields &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market seems to be favoring regions where
policymakers are taking an active role on deficit reduction and
that&#8217;s not the U.S.,&#8221; said Thanos Papasavvas, who helps manage
more than $5 billion in currencies at Investec Asset Management
Ltd. in London. &#8220;For Europe it may be painful in the short-
term, but they are dealing with it. The U.S., which has a much
bigger problem, isn&#8217;t even beginning to deal with it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the bond market is telling the U.S.
government to focus on growth, not the deficit. Yields on two-
year Treasury notes fell to a record low 0.5516 percent on July
23 and are 16 basis points, or 0.16 percentage point, less than
similar-maturity German debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Housing starts in the U.S. fell more than forecast last
month, the Commerce Department said July 20. Initial jobless
claims rose to 464,000 in the week ended July 17, exceeding the
highest estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg, Labor
Department figures on July 22 in Washington showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bearish on Dollar &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures traders turned bearish on the dollar for the first
time in almost three months on July 13, according to data from
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in Washington. So-
called short positions, or bets prices will fall, by hedge funds
and other large speculators outnumbered long positions by 99,175
on July 20, CFTC figures show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changing fortunes for the euro and the dollar caught
foreign-exchange funds by surprise, according to the Parker
BlackTree Currency Index, which tracks 22 currency funds that
manage about $15 billion. The index lost 1.7 percent between May
14, when valuations reached the highest level since November,
and July 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Foreign exchange is the world&#8217;s biggest fruit and
vegetable store, with millions of people playing it 24 hours a
day,&#8221; Goldman Sachs Chief Global Economist Jim O&#8217;Neill said on
July 21 in a radio interview with Tom Keene on Bloomberg
Surveillance. &#8220;Anybody who thinks they can get foreign exchange
right all the time should be in a lunatic asylum.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Commission said today
it had decided to initiate formal antitrust investigations
against International Business Machines Corp. in two separate
cases of alleged infringements of EU antitrust rules related to
the abuse of a dominant market position. The commission, the
EU&#8217;s executive branch in Brussels, released an e-mailed
statement on the probe. &#8220;Both cases are related to IBM&#8217;s

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. expects its Wheatstone
gas project in Australia to gain environmental approval in the
first quarter of 2011, allowing the second-largest U.S. energy
producer to start construction in the second half of next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The liquefied natural gas venture may have as many as six
processing units and produce as much as 25 million metric tons
of the fuel a year, Chevron Australia said in an environmental
review filed on its website today. Each Wheatstone unit will be
capable of producing 4 million to 7 million tons annually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron aims to make a decision to proceed with Wheatstone
in the middle of next year, a development timeline shows. The
Wheatstone and Gorgon projects, among more than a dozen proposed
LNG ventures in Australia targeting an increase in Asian demand
for cleaner-burning fuel, are &#8220;centerpieces&#8221; of Chevron&#8217;s
global growth plans, the company says on its local website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Wheatstone project is set to be one of Australia&#8217;s
largest resources projects,&#8221; generating about A$20 billion ($18
billion) in government revenue, Chevron Australia said in
comments e-mailed by Perth-based spokesman Guy Houston. The
company has yet to provide a cost estimate for the venture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The A$43 billion Gorgon project, which Chevron says is
Australia&#8217;s largest resources development, is due to begin LNG
exports in 2014 from a three-unit, 15 million ton-a-year
facility and may add a fourth and fifth processing unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Korea Gas Corp., the world&#8217;s largest importer of LNG,
signed an initial accord this month to buy 1.5 million tons of
the fuel a year from Wheatstone and to acquire a 5 percent stake
in the venture, which will have processing facilities near the
town of Onslow, 1,400 kilometers (870 miles) north of Perth.
Tokyo Electric Power Co. plans to take 4.1 million tons of LNG a
year from Wheatstone, under a deal announced in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wheatstone will include a domestic gas plant that will have
a capacity equal to about 15 percent of LNG sales, Chevron said
in the documents today. The project may employ 3,000 workers at
the peak of construction in 2014 and generate 6,500 &#8220;direct and
indirect&#8221; jobs while it is being built, the company said. First
LNG shipments are planned for 2016, according to Chevron. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project needs environmental approvals from both the
Australian and Western Australian state governments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said it&#8217;s
still &#8220;fundamentally positive&#8221; on China&#8217;s yuan-denominated
stocks even after a surge in the CSI 300 Index, given their
valuations and the emergence of several &#8220;catalysts.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong-listed shares of Chinese insurers are a
&#8220;convenient, yet fundamentally appealing, way&#8221; for foreign
investors to gain access to the A-share market, Goldman Sachs
analysts led by Kinger Lau and Timothy Moe said in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We stay fundamentally positive on A shares,&#8221; the
analysts wrote. &#8220;Although we do not expect policy to ease
immediately, we believe any further positive development on this
front can re-rate the market further.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CSI 300, tracking yuan-denominated shares on the
Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, has surged 12 percent since
this year&#8217;s low set on July 5, on speculation cooling economic
growth and property-price gains will spur the government to ease
its policy tightening. Chinese stocks are still the worst
performers in Asia this year, with the CSI 300 and the Shanghai
Composite Index both slumping 22 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after the gains, A shares are trading at 13 times
estimated profits with per-share earnings growth of 29 percent
in 2010 and 22 percent in 2011, according to Goldman Sachs
estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The low valuations have already discounted a pessimistic
macro/micro growth scenario and several catalysts are emerging,
including receding concerns over liquidity drain and potential
normalization of investors&#8217; positioning,&#8221; the analysts wrote in
today&#8217;s report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Stable&#8217; Policies &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CSI 300 fell 0.5 percent to 2,778.68 at the 11:30 a.m.
break, snapping a five-day, 6.8 percent rally. The Shanghai
Composite lost 0.4 percent following last week&#8217;s 6.1 percent
advance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Premier Wen Jiabao last week said in comments published by
Xinhua News Agency on a government website that stable policies
should be the main theme in the second half. He also highlighted
the importance of expanding domestic demand, saying that China
would &#8220;improve&#8221; stimulus measures for boosting consumption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s economic growth slowed to 10.3 percent in the
second quarter from an 11.9 percent increase in the January to
March period, prompting economists from Morgan Stanley to
JPMorgan Chase  Co. to cut their gross domestic product
forecasts for this year. Data released this month also showed
property prices in 70 Chinese cities fell 0.1 percent in June
from the previous month and banking lending cooled last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monetary Easing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent stock-market gains represent a &#8220;tradable
rebound, not yet a reversal,&#8221; driven by speculation about an
easing in mortgage policy, lower-than-expected inflation and the
completion of stress test for European banks, according to China
International Capital Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, &#8220;with GDP growth of 10.3 percent and lower-than-
expected inflation, property prices showing few signs of giving
back, and labor shortages in some regions, it is difficult to
convincingly argue for a general monetary easing,&#8221; CICC
analysts Hao Hong and Mei He said in a report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs analysts said they favored China Pacific
Insurance (Group) Co. for its &#8220;above-peer&#8221; new business value
growth potential and China Life Insurance Co., the nation&#8217;s
largest insurer, for its investments in A shares. China Pacific
has climbed 0.5 percent in Hong Kong trading this year while
China Life has dropped 10 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The H shares of insurers have had a &#8220;high directional
correlation&#8221; and this relationship is likely to remain in the
near term give their holdings of A shares, according to the
analysts. They also said the industry&#8217;s &#8220;fundamentals remain
strong,&#8221; with premiums growing at 34 percent in the first half
and long-term growth prospects looking &#8220;promising.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UBS AG went from last to third in
equity sales and trading revenue in the latest quarter among
the world&#8217;s largest investment banks, passing Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. along the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Oswald Gruebel attributed the
improvement at UBS&#8217;s investment bank to prudence, and praised
the people who &#8220;take risk, evaluate and manage it.&#8221; A rebound
at the unit helped UBS earn 2.01 billion Swiss francs ($1.9
billion) in the quarter, the Zurich-based bank said yesterday,
surpassing the estimate of analysts by almost 80 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gruebel, who led a turnaround at Credit Suisse Group AG
earlier this decade, joined UBS in February of last year after
more than $50 billion of credit losses and writedowns during the
subprime crisis. He has hired more than 850 people to rebuild
the bank&#8217;s debt and equity units, and appointed Carsten Kengeter, formerly of Goldman Sachs, to co-head the investment
bank with Alexander Wilmot-Sitwell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The results speak for themselves,&#8221; said Dirk Hoffmann- Becking, a London-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. &#8220;UBS
has become a lot better at hedging its bets. They hear the alarm
bells quicker and react quicker.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS&#8217;s share of equity trading revenue rose to 14 percent in
the second quarter from 9.8 percent in the first, company
reports show. Only Credit Suisse of Zurich and New York-based
Morgan Stanley took a bigger share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedging Volatility &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS decided in May to hedge its positions on equity options
sold to clients, anticipating a jump in volatility that occurred
after a May 6 market plunge temporarily erased $862 billion in
value from U.S. equities in less than 20 minutes. Goldman Sachs,
which saw its equities revenue fall by almost half in the second
quarter from the first, said last week that part of the drop was
due to the firm&#8217;s equity derivatives division not hedging its
short position on volatility fast enough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We thought in May that we better cover it and we covered
it,&#8221; UBS Chief Financial Officer John Cryan, 49, said on a
conference call with reporters and analysts yesterday. &#8220;It
wasn&#8217;t a trade that was intended to make money. It was a trade
that was intended to avoid the risk that we lost money.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While new hires, revamped management and better morale have
helped improve the bank&#8217;s results, so has an increased aversion
to risk, said Cryan. UBS cut risk-weighted assets at the
securities unit by 45 percent since the beginning of 2008.
Gruebel and Kengeter, 43, monitor traders&#8217; positions, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Biggest Casualties&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Carsten is on top of all of the risks, every day risk
calls, talking to traders,&#8221; said Cryan. &#8220;And that didn&#8217;t
happen during the past four or five years before he joined.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While too much prudence can come at a cost in terms of
future earnings, &#8220;we&#8217;re far away from that being a major issue
at UBS,&#8221; said Hoffmann-Becking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gruebel, 66, who was hired out of retirement to revive UBS,
skipped college and started his career as a trainee at Deutsche
Bank AG in 1961. He joined Credit Suisse in 1970, rising through
the ranks from its Eurobond trading desk. He doubled the bank&#8217;s
earnings and share price in the three years after taking over as
sole CEO in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS shares climbed 11 percent in Swiss trading yesterday,
and have risen 73 percent since Gruebel took over in February of
2009, following a state rescue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;UBS has been one of the biggest casualties of the
financial crisis so there was an awful lot of work to be done to
restructure the business,&#8221; said Henk Potts, who helps oversee
about $235 billion at Barclays Stockbrokers Ltd. in London.
&#8220;Perhaps we&#8217;re seeing a light at the end of a very long and
dark tunnel.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities Leadership &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS changed management of the equities trading unit after
Daniel Coleman, an almost 24-year veteran, stepped down in
March. The bank appointed Matt Rule, Dominic Vail and Joe Oertel
in April to head equity sales in Asia, Europe and the Americas,
respectively. It hired Axel Kilian from Nomura Holdings Inc. to
run equity derivatives distribution, and in May named Yassine Bouhara, formerly with Deutsche Bank, and Francois Gouws to head
the global equities business, succeeding Coleman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those changes followed a revamp of UBS&#8217;s debt trading
business, which is now &#8220;nearly completed,&#8221; according to
Gruebel. UBS in January named Rajeev Misra and Dimitri Psyllidis, formerly with Deutsche Bank and Merrill Lynch  Co.,
respectively, as co-heads of fixed-income, currencies and
commodities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strategy Working &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company hired Neal Shear as global head of securities
and Roberto Hoornweg as the global head of securities
distribution, both formerly with Morgan Stanley, to align the
equities and debt units and bring their sales teams closer
together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS beat analysts&#8217; estimates on debt trading revenue, which
fell 21 percent in the second quarter to 1.7 billion francs from
the first three months. The drop was smaller than the average of
38 percent at its seven rivals, according to company reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Gruebel&#8217;s strategy has worked out,&#8221; said Dirk Becker, a
Frankfurt-based banking analyst at Kepler Capital Markets. &#8220;It
looked for awhile like UBS may have over-hired, but in the
second quarter we saw that the hires did bring in revenue.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the bank&#8217;s 10 percent decline in trading revenue
in the second quarter from the first was less than the average
35 percent drop reported by its seven competitors, its total
sales and trading revenue so far this year is the lowest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gruebel isn&#8217;t satisfied. The equities unit still has &#8220;to
do a lot of catching up,&#8221; he told reporters yesterday, while
the debt business of a bank the size of UBS should be making 4
billion francs in revenue each quarter, double the target he set
for it in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gruebel said his message to traders now is similar to what
it was a year ago, when the bank just wanted to avoid losing
money: &#8220;Still don&#8217;t lose any money, but do more.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. agreed to buy
Playdom Inc. for $563.2 million, acquiring the second-biggest
maker of games played on Facebook and MySpace websites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playdom&#8217;s owners may receive an additional $200 million if
performance goals are met, Burbank, California-based Disney, the
world&#8217;s largest media company, said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchase extends Disney&#8217;s drive into online and mobile
games. This month, the company bought Tapulous Inc., a developer
of music-related games for Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPod and iPad. Playdom
has the talent Disney needs to expand in social media, Chief
Executive Officer Bob Iger said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I want to be bold and aggressive,&#8221; Iger said. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t get the kind of growth that we want by building from the
inside.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney plans to make more acquisitions, Iger said, without
being specific. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t intend to stand still as we migrate this
company&#8217;s great wealth of content to new technology,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playdom, based in Mountain View, California, raised $33
million in June from venture capital groups including Disney-
backed Steamboat Ventures, which invests in digital media,
consumer and technology companies. The funding brought the total
raised by the closely held company to $76 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playdom announced a content partnership with Disney&#8217;s ESPN
sports cable channel in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney fell 12 cents to $34.28 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have gained 6.3
percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A form of Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s erection
drug Viagra, sold as the blood-pressure treatment called Revatio
in adults, may be used for children with a rare lung disorder if
U.S. regulators can agree on how to test it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The condition, called pulmonary arterial hypertension,
affects only 600 children a year, New York-based Pfizer said. It
causes high blood pressure in arteries in the lungs, making the
right side of the heart work harder than normal and causing
chest pain, dizziness and fatigue. Outside advisers to the Food
and Drug Administration are set to meet July 29 to evaluate
whether Pfizer&#8217;s study of Revatio is sufficient to determine its
effectiveness in children, the agency said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA in 2001 asked Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, to study the medicine in children with the lung
disorder. If the New York-based company meets the FDA study
requirements, the drug would get an extra six months on the
market without generic competition. Patents on the drug, with
2009 sales of $1.89 billion as Viagra and $450 million as
Revatio, are expected to expire in 2012. Some doctors are
already using the treatment in kids with the lung condition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a good option in pediatric patients because it is
well-tolerated, in that it doesn&#8217;t have as many side effects as
some of the other options,&#8221; said Chad Knoderer, a pediatric
clinical pharmacist at Riley Hospital for Children in
Indianapolis, who has used Viagra in kids with the disorder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. halted a short
position on the pound after Britain&#8217;s currency broke above
April&#8217;s high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While the near-term setup argues for some pause, today&#8217;s
upside break suggests an increased risk for additional upside,&#8221;
Niall O&#8217;Connor, a technical analyst in New York at the second-
largest U.S. bank by assets, wrote in a research note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pound rallied 0.5 percent to $1.5569 after earlier
advancing as much as 0.6 percent to $1.5578, the highest level
since Feb. 18. Sterling traded above the 200-day moving average
for the first time since Jan. 28, according to Bloomberg data.
The pound broke the April high of $1.5526, according to
JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pound may dip to support of $1.5385 before advancing to
a range of $1.5750 and $1.5865, O&#8217;Connor wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. A support level is an area on a
chart where orders to buy a currency versus a counterpart may be
placed, potentially blocking a decline. A short position is a
bet a security will drop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Les Laboratoires Servier, France&#8217;s
second-largest drugmaker, was charged with misleading a European
Union agency probing potential antitrust violations by companies
seeking to keep cheaper generic medicines from entering the EU
market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Servier could face a fine of as much as 1 percent of annual
revenue if the European Commission, antitrust agency for the 27
EU nations, concludes the French company &#8220;intentionally or
negligently&#8221; submitted incorrect data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The commission&#8217;s provisional view is that it has evidence
that Servier has provided misleading and incorrect
information,&#8221; the regulator said yesterday in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission, based in Brussels, started a probe of the
pharmaceutical industry in January 2008. In a report last year,
it found that companies use a variety of techniques to delay the
introduction of generics &#8220;for as long as possible.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Servier &#8220;will fully cooperate&#8221; with the commission, the
Neuilly-sur-Seine, France-based company said in an e-mailed
statement, confirming it got the charge sheet today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Getting such a communication doesn&#8217;t prejudge the final
outcome,&#8221; the company said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., the world&#8217;s biggest
generic-drug maker, Denmark&#8217;s H. Lundbeck A/S and other
pharmaceutical companies were raided last December as part of
the ongoing probe. The December raids were the third in a series
by the commission, which had previously raided Servier&#8217;s offices
in November 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca Plc earlier this month lost a court challenge
to an EU decision finding it had misled patent officials and
abused its dominant position by hindering the marketing of
generic versions of its Prilosec heartburn medicine. &lt;/p&gt;

U.S. Library of Congress said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Librarian of Congress James H. Billington added the
practice, described in the ruling as &#8220;jailbreaking,&#8221; to a list
of actions that don&#8217;t violate copyright protections. The
decision affecting iPhones and other smartphones was posted
yesterday on the agency&#8217;s website as part of a periodic review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision was a victory for the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, a privacy-rights advocacy group that asked the
Library of Congress to exempt programs for smartphones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are thrilled to have helped free jailbreakers&#8221; from
the &#8220;overbroad reach&#8221; of U.S. copyright law, said Jennifer
Granick, civil liberties director of the San Francisco-based
group, in a statement posted on the group&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advocacy group&#8217;s &#8220;arguments really amount to an attack
on Apple&#8217;s particular business choices&#8221; for the iPhone and the
company&#8217;s iPhone App Store, Apple said in a filing with the
Library of Congress during consideration of the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exempting jailbreaking would &#8220;destroy the technological
protection of Apple&#8217;s key copyrighted computer programs in the
iPhone device itself and of copyrighted content owned by Apple
that plays on the iPhone,&#8221; Apple said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple spokesman Steve Dowling didn&#8217;t immediately return a
phone call yesterday seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users of iPhones still may risk voiding their warranties if
they make changes to the device in order to get applications not
approved by Apple, said Brian Marshall, a technology analyst
with Gleacher  Co. in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This happens quite frequently with people who want to
change the format on the phone and have more flexibility, but
when you do that you void the warranty,&#8221; Marshall said today in
a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toho Claims &#8216;Tuffzilla&#8217; Dog Chew Toy Infringes &#8216;Godzilla&#8217; Marks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toho Co. Ltd., the Japanese film company that holds the
copyright and trademarks for the &#8220;Godzilla&#8221; character, sued an
Arizona toy company for infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VIP Products LLC of Phoenix is accused of making and
selling a &#8220;Tuffzilla&#8221; toy Toho claims infringes on its
Godzilla marks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VIP toy &#8220;is not intended to depict any historical
dinosaur,&#8221; has the same appearance as Godzilla and the
&#8220;zilla&#8221; suffice used in its name is an attempt to &#8220;exploit
and capitalize on Godzilla&#8221; for commercial benefit, according
to the complaint filed July 23 in federal court in Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VIP sued Toho July 20 in federal court in Phoenix, asking
the court to declare that &#8220;Tuffzilla&#8221; squeaky dog toy doesn&#8217;t
infringe any of Toho&#8217;s IP rights, and asked the court for a
declaration to that effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its complaint, Toho called VIP a &#8220;serial infringer&#8221;
whose business &#8220;included taking the intellectual property of
others and trading on the popularity and goodwill of that
intellectual property for commercial gain.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Phoenix-based company was sued for trademark
infringement in 2008 by the company now known as Anheuser-Busch
InBev NV. That case was dismissed in January 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VIP is represented in its dispute with Toho by David G.
Bray of Mariscal, Weeks, McIntyre  Friedlander PA of Phoenix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case against Toho is VIP Products LLC v. Toho Co., 2:1-
cv-01533-JAT, U.S. District Court, District of Arizona
(Phoenix). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toho is represented by Aaron J. Moss and Charles N.
Shephard of Greenberg Glusker Fields Claman  Machtinger LLP of
Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aussie Entertainers&#8217; Union Seeks to Enter Infringement Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia&#8217;s Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance, the
country&#8217;s entertainment-industry union, asked a court for
permission to file a friend-of-the-court brief in the appeal of
a copyright case against an Internet service provider, The
Australian reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case was brought against iiNet Ltd., a Perth-based
Internet company, by the Australian Federation Against Copyright
Theft, a coalition of 30 content owners, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February a court ruled that iiNet wasn&#8217;t liable because
it hadn&#8217;t authorized its customers to make unauthorized use of
others&#8217; content, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In asking permission to intervene, the union said Internet
service providers profited from their customer&#8217;s illegal
activities, The Australian reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interior Designer Sues Utah Publisher Over Pattern Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A North Carolina designer of patterns for curtains and
other window treatments sued a Utah publisher for copyright
infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marylan Borchard of Matthews, North Carolina, sued Gibbs
Smith, of Layton, Utah, and Jacquelyn Von Tobel in federal court
in Charlotte, North Carolina for reproducing her patterns
without authorization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint filed July 23, Gibbs Smith
published &#8220;The Design Directory of Window Treatments,&#8221; a book
by Von Tobel in 2007. The 600-page book, sold by retailers such
as Amazon.com Inc., and Barnes  Noble Inc., is billed as &#8220;the
complete reference for homeowners, interior designers,
decorators and workrooms,&#8221; and contains more than 1.500 images.
It&#8217;s accompanied by a CD-Rom with line drawings for every color
illustration in the book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introduction to the CD encourages readers to &#8220;print
and customize according to your needs&#8221; the drawings, according
to court papers. Borchard, who does business as M&#8217;Fay Patterns,
claims that many of the illustrations in the book and CD &#8220;are
specifically identified as being derivatives of M&#8217;Fay
patterns.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The North Carolina designer said she never authorized Von
Tobel or the publisher to create or distribute any derivative
works based on her patterns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borchard included in her court filing an e-mail she
received from Von Tobel in April 2008 which acknowledged,
allegedly, that she included the M&#8217;Fay images in the book even
as she lacked permission to use them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I had to make a decision on whether to go ahead and
include your company or omit it. I felt it would be a disservice
to you and to the readers of the book not to include one of the
most prominent sources in the industry,&#8221; Von Tobel said in her
e-mail. &#8220;I made the decision to go ahead and include M&#8217;Fay,&#8221;
Von Tobel said, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borchardt asked the court to order seizure and destruction
of all copies of the allegedly infringing work, and for an order
barring all future infringement of her copyrights and trademark.
She also asked for awards of money damages, litigation costs,
and attorney fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She requested that the damages be increased &#8220;due to the
willful conduct&#8221; of the defendants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borchardt is represented by Matthew J. Ladenheim of Trego,
Hines  Ladenheim PLLC of Charlotte, North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Borchardt v. Von Tobel, 3:10-cv-00338, U.S.
District Court, Western District of North Carolina (Charlotte). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney Says Start-Up Companies Are Fakes, Infringe Trademarks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co., the 87-year-old entertainment company,
sued five Los Angeles residents and a Beverly Hills, California-
based company for trademark infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint, filed July 21 in federal court in Los
Angeles, alleges that Angelo Scrigna, Sundown Scrigna,
Ginocarlos Scrigna, Johann Scrigna, Phillip LoVoie and their
American Brokers Inc., are forming companies that infringe
Disney&#8217;s marks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney claims the companies, with names such as Walt Disney
Parks and Resorts LLC, Disney Enterprises Inc., and the Walt
Disney Company, have been started in Arkansas, Illinois,
Florida, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington &#8220;in a blatant scheme to
trade on these marks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already the public is sufficiently confused by these
companies with similar names, Disney says, so much so that court
documents intended for Disney have been served on some of the
other companies. The use of the Disney name isn&#8217;t authorized,
the company said, and deceived the public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angelo Scrigna delivered a letter to Disney July 7,
demanding the company quit using the name &#8220;The Walt Disney Co.
in Florida,&#8221; Disney said in its complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 13, Scrigna sent Disney a cease-and-desist letter,
demanding the company quit doing business in Los Angeles County
under the Disney name, according to court papers. Disney&#8217;s
Burbank, California, headquarters are in Los Angeles County. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Brokers Inc. didn&#8217;t respond immediately to an e-
mailed request for comment. According to the company website,
American Brokers focuses &#8220;on the old world fundamentals that
made fields grow for millenniums.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney asked the court to bar the defendants from any
unauthorized use of the Disney marks and company names, and to
order the dissolution of all the defendants&#8217; companies that use
Disney names. It also seeks immediate delivery of any materials
that were misdirected to the defendants&#8217; companies, and awards
of defendants&#8217; profits derived from the alleged infringement,
money damages, litigation costs and attorney fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is represented by Susan Laura Klein, David S.
Shukan and Jeffrey B. Valle of los Angeles-based Valle Makoff
LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Walt Disney Co. v. Angelo Scrigna, 2:10-cv-
05369-JFW-CW, U.S. District Court, Central District of
California (Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colgate Sued Over Imports of Mexican &#8216;Wildroot&#8217; Products &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colgate-Palmolive Co., the New York-based maker of consumer
products such as Irish Spring soap, Ajax cleanser and Skin
Bracer after-shave lotion, was sued for trademark infringement
by a Florida company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan Co. of Fort Lauderdale bought Wildroot and several
other trademarks from Colgate in 1995. The company uses the
Wildroot mark for some of its personal-grooming products.
Wildroot is a men&#8217;s hair tonic that was widely advertised in the
early days of television in the 1950s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Colgate sold the marks to closely held Stephan Co., it
retained the right to the Wildroot mark in Mexico and
&#8220;expressly or implicitly agreed&#8221; it had no rights to sell
products bearing the mark in the U.S., Stephan said in court
papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan initially filed suit in Florida state court on July
9, accusing Colgate of permitting U.S.-based distributors to buy
and import Wildroot products intended for the Mexican market
into the U.S. The case was transferred to federal court in Fort
Lauderdale on July 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Florida company says that based on the distribution
volumes in Mexico, Colgate knew or should know that the
infringing Wildroot products are being illegally diverted to the
U.S. The Mexican Wildroot product is &#8220;materially different from
Stephan&#8217;s product, and the public -- including distributors and
retail outlets -- is likely to be confused by the import,&#8221;
Stephan said in its pleadings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It asked the court to bar Colgate from activities that
infringe the Wildroot mark, and to order the New York company to
deliver all infringing merchandise and promotional material to
Stephan for destruction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it&#8217;s seeking an award of Colgate&#8217;s profits
related to the alleged infringement, money damages, extra
damages to punish Colgate for its conduct, and attorney fees and
litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan is represented by Richard E. Berman and Brian J.
McCarthy of Berman Kean  Riguera PA of Fort Lauderdale. Colgate
is represented by Jonathan Galler, Matthew Henry Triggs, and
Brendan O&#8217;Rourke of New York&#8217;s Proskauer Rose LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Stephan Co. v. Colgate-Palmolive Co., 0:10-cv-
61288-MGC, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida
(Fort Lauderdale). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s yuan-denominated shares are
&#8220;due for a catch up&#8221; in the second half of this year as the
nation delays further measures to curb property prices, said
JPMorgan Asset Management&#8217;s Emerson Yip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yip, a Hong Kong-based fund manager for JPMorgan Asset&#8217;s
Greater China team, said he&#8217;s considering buying more so-called
A shares as evidence mounts that the People&#8217;s Bank of China will
hold off from raising interest rates. He declined to say what
stocks he may buy or when he may do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m not saying they will catch up right at this moment,
but anecdotally we get a feel that sentiment has stabilized,&#8221;
Yip, whose firm oversees almost $1.2 trillion of assets, told
reporters in Hong Kong today. &#8220;People are now contemplating how
to buy into the market and what to buy, whereas previously they
were thinking whether or not to sell.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculation that measures to control property prices and
rising consumer prices will damp earnings has dragged down the
Shanghai Composite Index by 21 percent in 2010. The gauge, which
tracks the bigger of China&#8217;s stock exchanges, is the second-
worst performer this year among 93 global benchmark indexes
tracked by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s economic growth slowed to 10.3 percent in the
second quarter from an 11.9 percent increase in the January to
March period. Property prices in 70 Chinese cities rose 11.4
percent in June from a year earlier, slower than May&#8217;s 12.4
percent, according to statistics bureau data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Construction Bank, TSMC &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sentiment was very negative,&#8221; Yip said. &#8220;Whether it was
individual investors or fund managers, they reacted quickly to
the slowdown in China&#8217;s economic growth, and hence we saw the
market decline.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yip&#8217;s Greater China Fund is down 4.8 percent this year
through July 21, less than the 5.2 percent drop in the MSCI
China Index. China Construction Bank Corp., the nation&#8217;s second-
largest lender, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the
world&#8217;s largest maker of customized chips, were his fund&#8217;s two
largest holdings as of May 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest China will lift interest rates will be 2011,
and the country maintain its &#8220;supportive&#8221; monetary policy for
the rest of this year, Yip said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For the second half of the year, A shares are due for a
catch up phase,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crude oil prices are
&#8220;significantly&#8221; below the level warranted by fundamentals,
offering hedging opportunities for this year and next, Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The balance between supply and demand in oil will continue
to tighten in the second half of this year as global economic
growth may boost demand, returning inventories to &#8220;more
normal&#8221; levels toward the end of the year, David Greely, a
New York-based analyst, wrote in a report dated July 26. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman reduced its near-term price forecast to the lower
end of its targeted $85-$95 a barrel range for the second half
of this year because of higher inventories and &#8220;still-fragile&#8221;
sentiment in the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to expect improving fundamentals will provide
additional support to prices,&#8221;  Greely said. Goldman earlier
this year recommended buying December 2010 West Texas
Intermediate on the New York Mercantile Exchange at $77.75 a
barrel. This contract was trading at $80.31 a barrel at 12:01
p.m. in Singapore, $1.40 higher than that for delivery in
September. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Citigroup Inc. are attempting to sell the fourth offering of
securities backed by commercial mortgages this year as investor
sentiment rises toward everything from company bonds to loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield that investors demand to own top-rated
securities backed by commercial mortgages rather than Treasuries
fell 4 basis points yesterday to 281 basis points, or 2.81
percentage points, the narrowest in two months, according to a
Barclays Plc index. Ford Motor Co. sold $1.25 billion of notes
five days after saying it plans to regain its investment-grade
ranking. Loan prices reached the highest since May 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Federal Reserve warned today that commercial real
estate dragged down the U.S. economy in the past two months,
bond investors say growth is strong enough for borrowers to meet
debt payments. U.S. two-year interest-rate swap spreads narrowed
to a three-month low, in another indicator investors are willing
to take on more risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s more appetite for risk across the board,&#8221; said
Dan Castro, head of structured finance analytics and strategy at
broker-dealer BTIG LLC in New York. &#8220;CMBS is an avenue that&#8217;s
going to provide better returns. There are a lot of guys
clamoring for these returns.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offering from Goldman Sachs and Citigroup consists of
debt payments on 48 mortgages, according to a person familiar
with the transaction. Retail properties account for 78.2 percent
of the deal, said the person, who declined to be identified
because terms aren&#8217;t public. A $99.9 million loan for 660
Madison Ave. in midtown Manhattan, home to a Barneys New York
store, is the largest in the pool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agency Mortgage Debt &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spreads on top-rated commercial mortgage bonds, at the
lowest since May 20, are up from 219 basis points on April 16,
according to the BarCap CMBS AAA Super Duper Index. A year ago,
the debt paid a spread of 516 basis points, index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in credit markets, yields on Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac mortgage securities that guide U.S. home-loan rates
reached record lows relative to 10-year Treasuries. The cost of
protecting corporate bonds from default in the U.S. rose
following four days of declines. Nielsen Co., the television-
audience rating company taken private in a $10.2 billion buyout,
had to revise terms for an agreement to extend $1 billion of
loans after lenders refused to delay debt maturities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fannie Mae&#8217;s current-coupon 30-year fixed-rate mortgage
bonds fell to as low as 0.57 percentage point more than 10-year
Treasuries, before rising to 0.65 percentage point as of 5 p.m.
in New York, Bloomberg data show. The gap reached 0.59
percentage point on March 29, two days before the Fed ended its
buying of $1.25 trillion of so-called agency mortgage bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-Default Swaps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index of
credit-default swaps, which investors use to hedge against
losses on corporate debt or speculate on creditworthiness, rose
2.63 basis points to 105.13 basis points as of 5:26 p.m. in New
York, according to Markit Group Ltd. In London, the Markit
iTraxx Europe Index of swaps on 125 companies with investment-
grade ratings, climbed 2.63 to 106.25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both indexes typically rise as investor confidence
deteriorates and decline as it improves. Credit-default swaps
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nielsen increased the interest margin it&#8217;s offering to pay
over the London interbank offered rate, a borrowing benchmark,
by an additional 0.5 percentage point to 3.75 percentage points,
according to people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT, Morgan Stanley &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also cut the duration of the extension by one
year to May 2016. New York-based Nielsen has been trying to
improve its debt profile since the 2006 leveraged buyout loaded
its balance sheet with $5.4 billion of loans. Last month,
Nielsen filed to sell as much as $1.75 billion of shares in an
initial public offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford bonds were the most-traded corporate securities by
dealers today, with 193 trades of $1 million or more, Bloomberg
data show. Dallas-based ATT Inc., the largest U.S. phone
company, was ranked second with 172. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spreads on emerging-market bonds rose 7 basis points to 279
basis points, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. index data,
after ranging from as low as 229 on April 15 to as high as 359
on May 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Bryant Park &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last sale of commercial mortgage bonds, Bank of
America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. sold $650 million of debt
tied to a loan on One Bryant Park, a New York office tower. That
followed a JPMorgan offering two weeks earlier of $716.3 million
of debt, backed by loans to multiple borrowers. Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc sold $309.7 million of bonds in April, the
first issue to pool loans from multiple borrowers since June
2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks arranged $3.4 billion of the securities in all of
last year. Sales tumbled 95 percent to $11.2 billion in 2008
from a record $234 billion in 2007, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activity in commercial real estate, especially
construction, &#8220;remained weak, the Fed said today in its Beige
Book business survey. The report underscored the Fed&#8217;s view that
the recovery, while still moving forward, is progressing at a
slower pace than earlier in the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings Beat Estimates &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed reported improvements in service industries, an
increase in tourism, an expansion of manufacturing and progress
in labor markets. Two of the central bank&#8217;s 12 districts
reported the economy &#8220;held steady&#8221; and two said the pace of
expansion slowed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings have topped analysts&#8217; estimates at more than 80
percent of companies in the SP 500 that have reported second-
quarter results so far, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between Treasury yields and the rate to
convert from fixed to floating payments narrowed as much as 5.3
basis points to 16 basis points, the smallest since April 29. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A solid tightening of swap spreads is the order of the
day,&#8221; said Ian Lyngen, a government bond strategist at CRT
Capital Group LLC in Stamford, Connecticut. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of
money to be put to work, and spreads are tighter across the
curve.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between the rate to exchange floating- for
fixed-interest payments and Treasury yields for two years, known
as the swap spread, is a measure of investor perception of
credit risk. It serves as a benchmark for investors in many
types of debt, including mortgage-backed and auto-loan
securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leveraged Loan Prices &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2-year swap spread dropped 3.8 basis points to 17.44
basis points as of 2:56 p.m. in New York. The 5-year swap spread
was 0.8 basis point lower at 18.44. The 10-year spread fell 1.5
basis points to negative 2.25 basis points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s/LSTA US Leveraged Loan 100 Index rose
for a sixth day, climbing 0.29 cent to 89.58 cents on the
dollar. Loans have returned 3.64 percent this year, according to
the index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford, last year&#8217;s biggest issuer
of high-yield corporate debt, sold the 6.625 percent notes due
in 2017 at a yield of 6.9 percent through its finance unit,
Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s Investors Service rates Ford Motor Credit Co.&#8217;s
unsecured debt Ba3 and SP grades the company three steps lower
at B-. High-yield, high-risk, or junk, debt is rated below Baa3
by Moody&#8217;s and lower than BBB- by SP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second-largest U.S. automaker sold the securities less
than a week after reporting its biggest first-half profit in 12
years and debt reductions aimed at restoring the investment-
grade ratings it lost in 2005. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest
payments network, posted a fiscal third-quarter profit that
exceeded most Wall Street estimates for a 10th straight quarter
as more consumers paid with plastic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income for the three months ended June 30 was $716
million, or 97 cents a share, compared with $729 million, or 96
cents, in the same period a year earlier, the San Francisco-
based company said today in a statement. The average estimate of
31 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 93 cents. The year-earlier
results included a one-time gain of $237 million from the sale
of an investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Joseph W. Saunders may struggle to
match that performance next year, when the Federal Reserve
imposes new debit-card regulations aimed at Visa and No. 2
network MasterCard Inc. The rules will cap &#8220;swipe&#8221; fees, or
interchange, charged to merchants on each transaction and make
it easier for rival debit networks, such as one operated by KKR
 Co. subsidiary First Data Corp., to gain market share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While it is too early to fully and accurately gauge the
impact of the legislation, Visa has demonstrated an ability to
manage our business through periods of change,&#8221; said Saunders,
64, in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa said it&#8217;s sticking to a 2010 forecast for net revenue
growth at the high end of an 11 percent to 15 percent range.
Diluted earnings per share are expected to grow by more than 20
percent annually this fiscal year and next, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharing &#8216;Pain&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa and MasterCard, based in Purchase, New York, set
interchange rates and pass the money to card-issuing banks
including Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase  Co. and
Citigroup Inc. The legislation could reduce annual interchange
revenue at Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America by as
much as $2.3 billion, Chief Financial Officer Charles H. Noski
said this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Banks could seek to renegotiate their contracts with Visa
and MasterCard to share the economic pain associated with lower
interchange fees, which would potentially threaten a major
revenue stream,&#8221; said Stephen Sohn, an analyst with Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service, in a July 26 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contracts are the biggest revenue sources for the
networks. They generated $3.17 billion, or 46 percent of net
revenue, for Visa in fiscal 2009, and $2.38 billion, or 47
percent, at MasterCard last year. Visa&#8217;s third-quarter service
revenue climbed 13 percent to $873 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Powerful Force&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of processed transactions jumped 14 percent to
11.7 billion as spending on Visa credit and debit cards amounted
to $803 billion, a 14 percent increase when adjusted for
currency fluctuations, the company said. Cross-border volumes
climbed 17 percent, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The global shift from cash and checks to digital currency
is a powerful force that continues unabated, providing tangible
benefits to consumers, merchants, and governments worldwide,&#8221;
Saunders said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That trend may mitigate the cost of the legislation, Sohn
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Card-based and electronic payments, which may have exceeded
cash and checks for the first time in 2009, will probably
account for about 64 percent of an estimated $9 trillion in U.S.
consumer transactions by 2013, according to the Nilson Report,
an industry newsletter based in Carpinteria, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa fell $1.43, or 1.9 percent, to $75.18 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has dropped 14
percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MasterCard, which is scheduled to report second-quarter
results on Aug. 3, declined 1.9 percent to $210.09. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Citigroup Inc. plan to sell $788.5 million of bonds backed by
commercial mortgages, according to a person familiar with the
offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue contains debt on 48 properties, said the person
who declined to be identified because terms aren&#8217;t public.
Retail account for 78.2 percent of the pool and offices make up
10.4 percent, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offering comes as Wall Street works to revive the $700
billion market after sales tumbled 95 percent to $11.2 billion
in 2008, choking off funds to borrowers. Banks arranged $3.4
billion of the securities last year, and about $1.7 billion has
been sold in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current offering marks the third sale to pool
commercial mortgages from multiple borrowers this year,
Bloomberg data show. JPMorgan Chase  Co. was the most recent
issuer, with a $716.3 million offering on June 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borrowers are struggling to secure enough financing to pay
off maturing mortgages amid tighter underwriting standards and
property prices down 39 percent from 2007 peaks, according to
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procter  Gamble Co., the world&#8217;s
largest consumer-products company, agreed to become a worldwide
Olympic sponsor through 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10-year sponsorship with the International Olympic
Committee covers the next five Games starting with London 2012,
the company and governing body said today in a joint statement.
Financial terms weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PG becomes the 11th global sponsor for the London
Olympics. The Cincinnati-based company sponsored the U.S. team
at this year&#8217;s Vancouver Winter Olympics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;PG&#8217;s global reach and consumer insight will be a real
boost in our efforts to communicate the Olympic values to a
worldwide audience and their financial support over the next
decade will benefit the entire Olympics movement, including the
athletes themselves,&#8221; IOC President Jacques Rogge said in the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IOC&#8217;s Worldwide Olympic Partners get exclusive
marketing rights in their product category. Among PG&#8217;s global
brands are Gillette shavers, Duracell batteries, Pampers diapers
and Pantene shampoo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PG is the second new Olympic sponsor announced this month
after Dow Chemical Co. The other sponsors for London 2012 are
Coca-Cola, Acer, Atros Origin, General Electric, McDonald&#8217;s,
Omega, Panasonic, Samsung and Visa. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell Plc is set to have
an even bigger impact in Australia in the next year, potentially
joining with Santos Ltd. to develop a gas project in Queensland
and selling its refining assets, Goldman Sachs JBWere said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell already has been &#8220;active,&#8221; Aiden Bradley, an
analyst at Goldman Sachs in Sydney, wrote in a report. Shell,
with PetroChina Co., agreed to buy Arrow Energy Ltd., advanced
with the A$43 billion ($38 billion) Gorgon liquefied natural gas
project led by Chevron Corp. and said it would use floating LNG
technology for the first time to develop the Prelude venture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe that this is only the beginning&#8221; as The
Hague-based Shell continues its shift toward gas from oil,
Bradley wrote today. &#8220;Over the next year we believe its focus
on this combination of Australia and LNG will again have far-
reaching implications for the oil and gas sector here.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell may acquire more reserves to support a coal seam gas-
to-LNG project in Queensland and cooperate with Santos, the
Adelaide-based company planning the Gladstone LNG development,
Goldman said. The oil producer, which runs the Clyde and Geelong
refineries, also may sell its &#8220;downstream&#8221; operations in
Australia to a U.S. or Asian refiner and join Chevron&#8217;s
Wheatstone LNG project, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ann Pickard, previously based with the company in Lagos,
Nigeria, became Shell&#8217;s top executive in Australia this year.
Pickard, executive vice president for oil and gas exploration
and production, is also succeeding Russell Caplan as chairman in
Australia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond 12 months, Shell is likely to &#8220;re-evaluate&#8221; its 34
percent interest in Woodside Petroleum Ltd., the Perth-based
company that&#8217;s Australia&#8217;s second-largest oil and gas producer,
the report said. Shell will probably not make a decision on the
Woodside position until mid-2012, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This stake is not a position we feel Shell is likely to
be satisfied with longer term,&#8221; Bradley said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. said Steve McPherson, president of its ABC Entertainment unit, has resigned
less than two months before the network&#8217;s new television season
begins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A replacement for McPherson will be named shortly, Burbank,
California-based Disney said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABC is adding six dramas to its schedule starting in
September after &#8220;Lost,&#8221; the network&#8217;s fifth-highest-rated
scripted show, concluded a six-year run in May. The network was
the only major U.S. broadcaster whose total audience declined
last season, and it&#8217;s also down among viewers aged 18 to 49, a
group sought by advertisers, according to Nielsen Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;McPherson has had a couple of bad seasons,&#8221; Brad Adgate,
director of research at New York-based advertising firm Horizon
Media Inc, said in an interview. &#8220;He never got his footing back
after the writers&#8217; strike.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three-month walkout by the Writers Guild of America
that ended in February 2008 idled scripted shows including
&#8220;Desperate Housewives&#8221; and &#8220;Grey&#8217;s Anatomy,&#8221; effectively
curtailing the 2007-2008 television season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Lee, head of the ABC Family cable channel, is
replacing McPherson, the Hollywood Reporter said, citing unnamed
company insiders. No one has been hired yet,     ABC spokesman Kevin Brockman said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement from his publicist, McPherson said he would
announce plans that include an &#8220;entrepreneurial venture in the
spirits business&#8221; and an &#8220;involvement in a new media
company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timing of the change is awkward for Disney, Adgate
said. TV networks are meeting this week with critics in Beverly
Hills, California, to preview their schedules for the season
that starts in September. ABC plans to make its presentation on
Aug. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comedy Block &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third among TV networks in prime-time audience, ABC plans
to air new shows including &#8220;Body of Proof&#8221; starring Dana Delany and &#8220;Detroit 1-8-7,&#8221; about a mock-documentary crew that
follows around homicide detectives. The network also picked up
the comedy &#8220;Mr. Sunshine,&#8221; featuring Matthew Perry as manager
of a San Diego sports arena. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McPherson established a block of comedy shows last TV
season on Wednesday nights that includes three returning
programs: &#8220;Modern Family,&#8221; &#8220;Cougar Town&#8221; and &#8220;The Middle.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network sold about $2.4 billion in ads ahead of the
season that starts in September for its full-day schedule, with
average prime-time rates rising 8 percent to 9 percent, a person
with knowledge of the matter said on June 9. ABC sold 75 percent
to 80 percent of its inventory, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By comparison NBC, last in prime-time viewers, sold about
$2.5 billion in advertising, with rates rising about 7 percent,
another person said on June 10. The network pre-sold about 70
percent of its prime-time inventory, that person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;High-Pressure Job&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a high pressure job where you get results the
next day and millions of dollars are riding on the programming
decisions you make,&#8221; Adgate said. &#8220;This is historically a very
short-lived position. You&#8217;re always in a pressure-cooker.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s biggest media company, fell 12 cents to
$34.28 yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
The shares have climbed 6.3 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike its rivals, ABC doesn&#8217;t carry National Football
League games, which provide some of TV&#8217;s biggest audiences and a
platform to promote new shows, Adgate said. Monday Night
Football airs on Disney&#8217;s ESPN cable network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without football, ABC relies more on entertainment programs
for ratings, Adgate said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sporting events have been on an upswing compared with
entertainment shows,&#8221; Adgate said. &#8220;That&#8217;s partly why ESPN is
the crown jewel of television at Disney, not ABC.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. Chief Executive
Officer Steve Ballmer said tablet computers are high on his
priority list as Apple Inc. takes the lead in a market his
company has tried to foster for more than a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Today, one of the top issues on my mind is &#8216;hey there&#8217;s a
category we have had Windows on for a long time and Apple&#8217;s done
an interesting job of putting together a synthesis and putting a
product out,&#8217;&#8221; Ballmer said today at Microsoft&#8217;s annual analyst
meeting at the company&#8217;s headquarters in Redmond, Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tablets based on Microsoft&#8217;s Windows operating system have
struggled since their initial release in 2002. Apple, based in
Cupertino, California, sold 3.27 million iPads last quarter,
outselling all comparable computers. The device debuted April 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re coming. We&#8217;re coming full guns,&#8221; Ballmer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ballmer said the company is working with hardware partners
to produce compelling tablet computers and will be aided by the
release early next year of a new Intel Corp. chip, code-named
Oak Trail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oak Trail is a dual-core version of Intel&#8217;s Atom chip for
tablets. It will improve battery life by using half the power
while offering enough processing to provide smooth video and
fast Web surfing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Foreseeable Future&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft signed an expanded licensing agreement last week
with ARM Holdings Plc, whose chip designs are used in Apple&#8217;s
iPad. While the new accord could allow Microsoft to expand the
use of ARM chips in Windows 7-based tablets, Ballmer said the
machines would be based on Intel architecture for the
&#8220;foreseeable future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the longer-term, Ballmer said Microsoft would &#8220;embrace
what we need to over time in terms of hardware.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft rose 8 cents to $26.03 at 4 p.m. New York time on
the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares have declined 15 percent
this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ballmer said he was less worried about competition in
tablets from Google Inc.&#8217;s Android and Chrome operating systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Bring it, we relish the competition,&#8221; he said of Google&#8217;s
efforts in tablet operating systems. &#8220;If we can&#8217;t compete with
whatever the weird collection of Android machines is going to
look like, shame on us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ballmer also commented on Microsoft&#8217;s mobile operating
system, Windows Phone 7, which is due on phones later this year.
Asked what he would do if the program is another Vista, a
reference to the poorly received version of Windows, Ballmer
replied &#8220;it won&#8217;t be.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein said
Microsoft&#8217;s board will address the subjects of dividends and
share buybacks at its fall board meeting, as it typically does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg data suggests Microsoft may announce an increase
in its quarterly dividend in September to 15 cents a share from
13 cents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lan Airlines SA, Latin America&#8217;s
largest airline by market value, fell the most in four weeks as
JPMorgan Chase  Co. cut its rating to &#8220;neutral,&#8221; saying
growth potential is mostly reflected in the stock price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lan fell 0.9 percent to 11,942 pesos, the biggest decline
since July 1. Chile&#8217;s IPSA index rose 0.1 percent to 4,357.21.
Lan was the most-active stock in Santiago trading, with 16.6
billion pesos changing hands, according to the exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The airline&#8217;s second-quarter results missed JPMorgan&#8217;s
&#8220;aggressive&#8221; estimates, analysts Brian Chase, Jamie Baker and
Scott Tan said in an e-mailed note, lowering the stock from
&#8220;overweight.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The recovery/growth outlook appears largely priced in,&#8221;
the analysts said. Lan is up 38 percent this year compared with
the MSCI Chile Index&#8217;s 14 percent gain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks fell, sending the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index lower for a third day, as earnings
and forecasts that disappointed investors at technology and
consumer companies wiped out an early advance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symantec Corp. and Nvidia Corp. lost at least 9.9 percent
after reporting forecasts, while Akamai Technologies Inc. slid
13 percent after saying its profit margin shrank. Colgate-
Palmolive Co. sank 6.8 percent as sales trailed estimates.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. rose 3.7 percent after saying the
industry&#8217;s regulatory overhaul won&#8217;t cause &#8220;significant&#8221;
reduction in revenue, according to Bank of America Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 fell 0.4 percent to 1,101.53 at 4 p.m. in New

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The picture remains mixed,&#8221; said Keith Wirtz, who
oversees $18 billion as chief investment officer at Fifth Third
Asset Management Inc. in Cincinnati. &#8220;We&#8217;ll probably see this
give and take during the summer because the liquidity is not
normal. The employment conditions remain challenging. Good
earnings results are not helping stock prices much. However,
when you have bad numbers, stocks get killed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 fell the previous two days after consumer
confidence slumped more than forecast, orders for durable goods
unexpectedly decreased and the Federal Reserve said economic
growth slowed in some areas. The gauge has climbed 6.9 percent
in July, headed for its best monthly advance in a year, after
earnings topped estimates at about 77 percent of its companies
that have reported second-quarter results so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slower GDP Growth &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Commerce Department report tomorrow may show U.S. growth
slowed to 2.6 percent in the second quarter, from 2.7 percent in
the first, based on the median forecast of economists in a
Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akamai Technologies sank 13 percent to $38.35. The largest
supplier of software to make websites and digital media load
faster said its profit margin shrank as it added business from
customers like Netflix Inc. at lower prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symantec fell 11 percent to $13.03. The world&#8217;s largest
maker of computer security software forecast second-quarter
sales and profit that missed analysts&#8217; estimates, citing
weakness in the euro and &#8220;cautiousness&#8221; among customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nvidia, LSI &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nvidia slumped 9.9 percent to $9.13. The second-largest
maker of graphics chips lowered its second-quarter sales
forecast to a range between $800 million to $820 million. That
compares with a prediction of $950 million to $970 million given
May 13. Analysts had projected sales of $944.7 million,
according to the average from a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LSI Corp. had the biggest decline in the SP 500, falling
14 percent to $4.08. The maker of chips used in computer disk
drives said third-quarter sales will be between $625 million and
$655 million. That compares with the $694.9 million average of
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle Corp. fell 2.4 percent to $23.70 as the U.S. filed a
complaint under the False Claims Act against the company and
Oracle America Inc., alleging that it defrauded the U.S. on a
General Services Administration software contract that was in
effect from 1998 to 2006 and involved hundreds of millions of
dollars in sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Tech is not doing great and that&#8217;s enough to drag the
index,&#8221; said Michael Mullaney, who manages $9 billion at
Fiduciary Trust Co. in Boston. &#8220;We need to get a better
economic picture in order to get a sustainable stocks rally. We
need to get job creation and the consumer back on board.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colgate &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colgate-Palmolive led a gauge of consumer-staples stocks to
the second-biggest decline among 10 industries in the SP 500.
The world&#8217;s largest toothpaste maker reported second-quarter
sales of $3.81 billion, missing the average analyst estimate in
a Bloomberg survey of $3.94 billion. Colgate slumped 6.8 percent
to $78.12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. declined 4.3 percent to $71.98. The Department of
Justice has indicated that it is considering filing a civil
lawsuit over a policy that bars merchants from charging extra to
customers who pay with credit cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The department has indicated that it is considering filing
a civil lawsuit," Chief Executive Officer Joseph W. Saunders said
yesterday in a conference call with analysts after Visa reported
fiscal third-quarter results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utility companies had the biggest decline in the SP 500
among 10 industry groups, falling 1.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constellation Energy Group Inc. fell 4.6 percent to $31.75.
Jefferies  Co. lowered its 2010 earnings estimate for the
supplier of electricity and natural gas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rates &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard
said the central bank should resume purchases of Treasury
securities if the economy slows and prices fall rather than
maintain a pledge to keep rates near zero. Bullard, a voting
member of the Federal Open Market Committee this year, said
using Fed communications to pledge rates will stay near zero may
prove to be detrimental. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. and Japanese stocks were cut and European shares were
raised by UBS AG global strategists, who said there is less risk
and economic data is more supportive in Europe. U.S. shares were
cut to &#8216;&#8216;neutral&#8217;&#8217; and Japanese equities were lowered to
&#8216;&#8216;underweight,&#8217;&#8217; according to a report by strategist Jeffrey Palma to clients dated July 28. Both regions were previously
rated &#8216;&#8216;overweight.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks rose earlier today, sending the SP 500 up 0.9
percent, after the Labor Department reported that the number 
of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment 
insurance fell to 457,000 last week, less than the median 
estimate  in a Bloomberg survey of economists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Very Slowly&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;The economy is recovering very slowly even as profits
rebound very fast,&#8217;&#8217; said David Kelly, who helps oversee $445
billion as chief market strategist for JPMorgan Funds in New
York. &#8216;&#8216;Today&#8217;s jobless claims were slightly better-than-
expected, but I don&#8217;t think it really changes the story. The
employment rebound is still slow.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs rose 3.7 percent to $152.58. The impact of
the financial reform will be minimal unless market-making rules
&#8220;turn out to be draconian (which they believe is unlikely),&#8221;
Bank of America Corp. analyst Guy Moszkowski wrote in a report
sent to clients today, citing a meeting with Goldman Sachs
President Gary Cohn and Chief Financial Officer David Viniar.
The company &#8220;is not waiting for final rules to be formulated by
regulators to decide where to invest and how to grow.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citrix Systems Inc. surged 20 percent, the biggest gain in
the SP 500, to $56.67. The maker of networking software was
raised to &#8220;outperform&#8221; from &#8220;neutral&#8221; at Robert Baird  Co.
and to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;underperform&#8221; at Cowen  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cisco Systems Inc. stock was halted for five minutes
following a 100-share trade on NYSE Amex that drove the shares
up more than 10 percent, triggering a circuit breaker
implemented after the May 6 market crash. Cisco fell 0.8 percent
to $23.21. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buck Showalter, who led the New York
Yankees to the best record in the American League during the
strike-shortened 1994 season, was hired today as the manager of
the Baltimore Orioles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Showalter, 54, a two-time AL Manager of the Year, also
managed the Arizona Diamondbacks and Texas Rangers and has an
882-833 record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Orioles fired manager Dave Trembley on June 4, and Juan Samuel has led the club as an interim replacement since then.
The Orioles&#8217; 31-70 record is the worst in baseball. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Orioles announced the signing in a release on their
website and said Showalter would take over on Aug. 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The son of a high-school coach, Showalter was an All-
American baseball player at Mississippi State University before
spending seven seasons in the minor leagues as an outfielder and
first baseman. He never made Major League Baseball as a player. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Showalter then spent five seasons managing in the Yankees&#8217;
farm system before becoming a coach in New York and replacing
Stump Merrill as manager in 1992. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He went 313-268 with the Yankees in 1992-95 before owner
George Steinbrenner replaced Showalter with Joe Torre. The
Yankees were 70-43 when a players strike stopped the 1994
season, and reached the playoffs the next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Showalter was 250-236 with the Diamondbacks in 1998-2000
and 319-329 with Texas in 2003-06. He has since been working as
an analyst with Walt Disney Co.&#8217;s ESPN. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roy Oswalt joined the Philadelphia
Phillies from the Houston Astros, the second straight season the
defending National League champions have acquired an All-Star
pitcher near the trade deadline from a struggling team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal was announced by the Astros in a statement on
their website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get Oswalt, a three-time All-Star pick, the Phillies
gave up their best young starter, J.A. Happ, and two prospects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oswalt, a 32-year-old right-hander, waived his no-trade
clause and left the team he helped reach the World Series in
2005. He had asked to be traded in May, with the Astros in last
place. They now are fifth in the National League Central. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Phillies, World Series champions two years ago and NL
title holders last season, are in second place in the East, 3&#189;
games behind Atlanta. A year ago, they got Cliff Lee, the
reigning American League Cy Young Award winner, in a deadline
deal from the Cleveland Indians, who finished tied with Kansas
City for last place in the AL Central. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oswalt has a 3.42 earned run average and was 6-12 with the
Astros, who currently sit 17 games under .500. He has a career
record of 143-82 with an ERA of 3.24 in his 10th season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He went 20-12 with a 2.94 ERA five years ago as the Astros
won the NL pennant before being swept by the Chicago White Sox
in the World Series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happ, a 27-year-old left-hander, has battled a forearm
strain and been limited to three starts this season, his second
full year in the major leagues. He has a career ERA of 3.11 and
a 14-5 record over parts of four seasons. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. posted its biggest
profit increase since 2003, exceeding analysts&#8217; estimates, as
rising production helped the largest U.S. oil company take
advantage of gains in energy prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second-quarter net income jumped 91 percent to $7.56
billion, or $1.60 a share, from $3.95 billion, or 81 cents, a
year earlier, Irving, Texas-based Exxon said today in a
statement. Per-share profit was 15 cents higher than the average
of 17 analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Europe&#8217;s biggest energy
company, capitalized on jumps in oil and fuel prices by boosting
production. Exxon&#8217;s output climbed 8.4 percent to the equivalent
of 4 million barrels of oil a day. Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson ramped up capital spending to more than $70 million a
day since 2008, ending a slide that left production at the
lowest level since the 1999 acquisition of Mobil Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The law of large numbers says the bigger you are, the
harder it is to grow,&#8221; said Philip Weiss, an analyst at Argus
Research in New York who has a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on Exxon shares
and doesn&#8217;t own any. &#8220;If they can deliver higher production,
that&#8217;s a big plus because that means that they&#8217;re going to be
delivering more income and cash flow.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donald Yacktman, whose $2.3 billion
Yacktman Fund has outperformed 97 percent of funds with similar
objectives over the past five years, said he likes shares of
Microsoft Corp., Viacom Inc. and ConocoPhillips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft &#8220;is dirt-cheap,&#8221; Yacktman, whose fund has
posted an annualized return of 7.2 percent since mid-2005, said
today in an interview on Bloomberg Television. &#8220;The wind
continues to blow to a large degree at their back.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest software maker has fallen 17 percent
since its 2010 peak on April 22 while the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
Index has dropped 8.9 percent. The Redmond, Washington-based
company posted record fourth-quarter revenue on July 23 after
the most successful debut of its flagship operating system. The
stock rose 0.3 percent to $26.03 at 4 p.m. New York time today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viacom, which has the Jersey Shore reality TV series on its
network, &#8220;is still relatively cheap,&#8221; said the founder of
Yacktman Asset Management Co. &#8220;The real pieces of this company
are the stable pieces of Nickelodeon, Comedy Central and MTV. In
total the viewership at Viacom represents about 20 percent of
cable TV so that&#8217;s a huge share.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viacom, based in New York and controlled by Chairman Sumner Redstone, has gained 11 percent this year. The Class B shares
gained 0.2 percent to $32.94 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ConocoPhillips, the U.S. oil company which is in the middle
of a $10 billion asset-sale program, &#8220;is a very cheap stock,&#8221;
Yacktman said. &#8220;Once the economy heats up, I think we&#8217;re going
to see oil prices heading north.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which plans to sell its entire 20 percent
stake in Russia&#8217;s OAO Lukoil, has fallen 8.6 percent since May
3. The stock rose 1.2 percent to $54.56 today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The euro&#8217;s rally will probably end
as economic weakness in Europe outside Germany saps demand for
the 16-nation currency, according to Rebecca Patterson of
JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The currency has rallied 10 percent from a four-year low of
$1.1877 reached June 7, encouraging hedge funds and other large
speculators to reduce bets against the currency to a six-month
low. The euro may peak after reaching at least $1.3125, the next
level of technical resistance, according to Patterson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re close to the point where you want to start
lightening up on long euros,&#8221; Patterson, global head of foreign
exchange at the private banking unit of JPMorgan in New York,
said in a radio interview today on &#8220;Bloomberg Surveillance&#8221;
with Tom Keene. &#8220;Germany is the only element of strength here.
It&#8217;s Germany versus the rest of Europe. And I think with that
backdrop, it&#8217;s hard to see all of this continuing very far.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro climbed 0.7 percent to $1.3086 at 1:49 p.m. in New
York, from $1.2995 yesterday, after advancing to $1.3107, the
highest level since May 4. The shared currency was headed for a
July rally of 6.9 percent versus the greenback after today&#8217;s
advance erased last week&#8217;s 0.2 percent drop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe&#8217;s currency traded above $1.31 for the first time in
almost three months after the Federal Labor Agency in Nuremberg
said Germany&#8217;s unemployment rate fell this month to 7.6 percent,
from 7.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At these levels I&#8217;d be happy to start selling it again,&#8221;
Patterson said in the interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Euro Net Shorts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference in the number of wagers by hedge funds and
other large speculators for a decline in the euro compared with
those on a gain fell on July 20 to 24,251, the lowest level
since January, according to the Washington-based Commodity
Futures Trading Commission. Net shorts reached a record 113,890
on May 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro also got a boost today as the European
Commission in Brussels said today that an index of executive and
consumer sentiment in the euro nations increased this month to
101.3, the highest since March 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The currency region may lag behind other industrialized
economies this year, expanding just 1 percent, the International
Monetary Fund said on July 8. In Japan, the economy may grow 2.4
percent in 2010, while U.S. gross domestic product is seen
increasing 3.3 percent, the IMF forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. A resistance level is an area on a
chart where orders to sell a currency versus a counterpart may
be placed, potentially blocking an advance. &lt;/p&gt;

Baseball&#8217;s worst record, the Baltimore Sun said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Showalter, 54, was chosen after protracted negotiations,
the Sun said, citing two unidentified people. The Orioles are
31-70 and 33 1/2 games behind the first-place Yankees in the

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest
payments network, fell as much as 5 percent after saying the
U.S. Department of Justice may sue the company over a policy
that bars merchants from charging extra to customers who pay
with credit cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The department has indicated that it is considering
filing a civil lawsuit,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer Joseph W. Saunders said yesterday in a conference call with analysts after
San Francisco-based Visa reported fiscal third-quarter results.
&#8220;We are currently engaged in constructive negotiations with the
department to resolve its concerns as it relates to Visa without
litigation or payment of monetary damages.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa, American Express Co. and Purchase, New York-based
MasterCard Inc. disclosed in 2008 that the Justice Department
was investigating the companies over so-called anti-surcharging
policies and rules prohibiting merchants from &#8220;steering&#8221;
customers to other forms of payment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department&#8217;s antitrust division is
&#8220;investigating whether certain credit-card network rules
regarding merchants&#8217; treatment of various payment forms,
including credit cards, are anticompetitive,&#8221; spokeswoman Gina Talamona said in an e-mail. She declined to discuss specific
companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa dropped $3.40, or 4.5 percent, to $71.78 at 1:04 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading after touching
$71.40. MasterCard declined 1.7 percent and AmEx fell less than
1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Regulatory Uncertainty&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions that address some of
the complaints raised by the Justice Department and a pending
federal antitrust lawsuit brought by merchants against Visa and
MasterCard. One of the rules pushed by U.S. Senator Richard Durbin, the Illinois Democrat and majority whip, will allow
merchants to offer discounts for various forms of payment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FBR Capital Markets analyst Scott Valentin cited
&#8220;regulatory uncertainty&#8221; in lowering his forecast for Visa,
saying the shares may climb to $96 within 12 months, down from
$115. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Management commentary lacked specifics regarding the
impact of the Durbin amendment,&#8221; Valentin said today in a note
to clients. He continues to rate the shares &#8220;outperform.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legislation and Saunders&#8217;s comments may indicate that
Visa also is working to avoid a trial by settling the merchants&#8217;
lawsuit, said Jason Kupferberg, an analyst with UBS Securities
LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Differential Pricing&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Durbin amendment has effectively legalized
differential pricing for all tender types, which may address the
anti-surcharging and anti-steering practices that the DOJ was
examining,&#8221; Kupferberg said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s too early to tell whether the legislation and a
Justice Department lawsuit would lead to a settlement in the
merchants&#8217; case, said K. Craig Wildfang, lead attorney for the
plaintiffs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Having another government agency conclude that these
things are anticompetitive -- it&#8217;s been true around the world --
and to have the DOJ weigh in on this, would be, in the grand
scheme of things, helpful to the private plaintiffs,&#8221; Wildfang
said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MasterCard, which is scheduled to report second-quarter
results on Aug. 3, didn&#8217;t address Visa&#8217;s comments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve been cooperating fully with the DOJ since they
issued their civil investigative demand in October 2008,&#8221;
MasterCard spokesman James Issokson said in a telephone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joanna Lambert of New York-based American Express declined
to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Citigroup Inc. are attempting to sell the fourth offering of
securities backed by commercial mortgages this year as investor
sentiment rises toward everything from company bonds to loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield that investors demand to own top-rated
securities backed by commercial mortgages rather than Treasuries
fell 8 basis points yesterday to 273 basis points, or 2.73
percentage points, the narrowest in more than two months,
according to a Barclays Plc index. Ford Motor Co. sold $1.25
billion of notes five days after saying it plans to regain its
investment-grade ranking. Loan prices reached the highest since
May 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Federal Reserve warned yesterday that commercial
real estate dragged down the U.S. economy in the past two
months, bond investors say growth is strong enough for borrowers
to meet debt payments. U.S. two-year interest-rate swap spreads
narrowed for a fourth consecutive day, in another indicator
investors are willing to take on more risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s more appetite for risk across the board,&#8221; said
Dan Castro, head of structured finance analytics and strategy at
broker-dealer BTIG LLC in New York. &#8220;CMBS is an avenue that&#8217;s
going to provide better returns. There are a lot of guys
clamoring for these returns.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offering from Goldman Sachs and Citigroup consists of
debt payments on 48 mortgages, according to a person familiar
with the transaction. Retail properties account for 78.2 percent
of the deal, said the person, who declined to be identified
because terms aren&#8217;t public. A $99.9 million loan for 660
Madison Ave. in midtown Manhattan, home to a Barneys New York
store, is the largest in the pool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agency Mortgage Debt &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spreads on top-rated commercial mortgage bonds, at the
lowest since May 18, are up from 219 basis points on April 16,
according to the BarCap CMBS AAA Super Duper Index. A year ago,
the debt paid a spread of 516 basis points, index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in credit markets, the extra yield investors
demand to own corporate bonds instead of government debt fell 1
basis point to 177 basis points, the lowest since May 19,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch&#8217;s Global Broad Market
Corporate index. Average yields fell to 3.809 percent, from
3.852 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of protecting corporate bonds from default in the
U.S. declined with the Markit CDX North America Investment Grade
Index, which investors use to hedge against losses on corporate
debt or speculate on creditworthiness, falling 0.1 basis point
to 105.03 basis points as of 12:36 p.m. in New York, according
to Markit Group Ltd. In London, the Markit iTraxx Europe Index
of swaps on 125 companies with investment-grade ratings dropped
1.4 to 104.33. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Bryant Park &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both indexes typically decline as investor confidence
improves and rise as it deteriorates. Credit-default swaps pay
the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last sale of commercial mortgage bonds, Bank of
America and JPMorgan Chase  Co. sold $650 million of debt tied
to a loan on One Bryant Park, a New York office tower. That
followed a JPMorgan offering two weeks earlier of $716.3 million
of debt, backed by loans to multiple borrowers. Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc sold $309.7 million of bonds in April, the
first issue to pool loans from multiple borrowers since June
2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks arranged $3.4 billion of the securities in all of
last year. Sales tumbled 95 percent to $11.2 billion in 2008
from a record $234 billion in 2007, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beige Book &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activity in commercial real estate, especially
construction, &#8220;remained weak, the Fed said yesterday in its
Beige Book business survey. The report underscored the Fed&#8217;s
view that the recovery, while still moving forward, is
progressing at a slower pace than earlier in the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed reported improvements in service industries, an
increase in tourism, an expansion of manufacturing and progress
in labor markets. Two of the central bank&#8217;s 12 districts
reported the economy &#8220;held steady&#8221; and two said the pace of
expansion slowed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings have topped analysts&#8217; estimates at 78 percent of
companies in the SP 500 that have reported second-quarter
results since July 12, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Corporate credit in particular looks very attractive,&#8221;
while Treasuries offer no yield, Kathleen Gaffney, co-manager of
the Loomis Sayles Bond Fund in Boston, said on Bloomberg
Television&#8217;s &#8220;Street Smart&#8221; with Carol Massar and Matt Miller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leveraged Loans &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between the rate to exchange floating- for
fixed-interest payments and Treasury yields for two years, known
as the swap spread, is a measure of investor perception of
credit risk. It serves as a benchmark for investors in many
types of debt, including mortgage-backed and auto-loan
securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two-year swap spread narrowed 1.43 basis point to 15.88
basis points, the lowest since April 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s/LSTA US Leveraged Loan 100 Index rose
for a sixth day yesterday, climbing 0.29 cent to 89.58 cents on
the dollar. Loans have returned 3.64 percent this year,
according to the index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pacific Investment Management Co., the world&#8217;s largest
manager of bond funds, is attracting almost $1 billion a week
from investors, according to Bill Gross, the firm&#8217;s co-founder
and co-chief investment officer. Gross&#8217;s Total Return Fund
returned 13 percent in the past 12 months, beating 64 percent of
its peers, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;New Normal&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returns of 10 percent or higher are unlikely in what Pimco
calls the &#8220;new normal,&#8221; where deleveraging, re-regulation and
de-globalization lead to slower growth, Gross said yesterday in
a Bloomberg Radio&#8217;s &#8220;On The Economy&#8221; interview with Tom Keene.
Gross has said investors should be prepared for returns of about
4 percent to 5 percent from bonds and stocks over the next
several years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford, last year&#8217;s biggest issuer
of high-yield corporate debt, sold the 6.625 percent notes due
in 2017 at a yield of 6.9 percent through its finance unit,
Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ford Motor Credit Co. 6.625 percent notes due in
2017 rose 0.64 cent to 99.125 cents on the dollar, yielding 6.9
percent, or 385 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, as of 12:11 p.m. in New York, according to Trace,
the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s Investors Service rates Ford Motor Credit&#8217;s
unsecured debt Ba3 and SP grades the company three steps lower
at B-. High-yield, high-risk, or junk, debt is rated below Baa3
by Moody&#8217;s and lower than BBB- by SP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second-largest U.S. automaker sold the securities less
than a week after reporting its biggest first-half profit in 12
years and debt reductions aimed at restoring the investment-
grade ratings it lost in 2005. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right-handed pitcher Roy Oswalt will
move to the Philadelphia Phillies from the Houston Astros if he
approves a trade worked out by the two teams, KRIV-TV reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oswalt, 32, must waive a no-trade clause in his contract
for the deal to go through, the Houston television station said,
citing unidentified people in Major League Baseball. The Astros
will take on an undisclosed portion of Oswalt&#8217;s contract, which
will pay him $5 million for the remainder of this season and $16
million next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oswalt, a three time All-Star, has a 3.12 earned run
average and 117 strikeouts this year. He has a 6-11 record for
Houston, which is 17 games under .500 at 42-59. The Phillies,
the defending National League champions, are 55-46 and 3&#189; games
behind the Atlanta Braves in the NL East Division. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s National Commodity 
Derivatives Exchange Ltd., partly owned by Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., is considering taking an anchor investor, Chief Executive
Officer R. Ramaseshan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are keeping that option open and we are actively
looking at what could be the contribution of an anchor
investor,&#8221; he said in an interview in Mumbai yesterday.
&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing conclusive at this point in time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying a stake in a commodity bourse in India, the top user
of gold and the second-biggest grower of wheat and rice, will
let an investor tap a market where turnover is forecast by the
industry regulator to rise 20 percent in the year to March 31
from 77.65 trillion rupees ($1.7 trillion) a year earlier. NYSE
Euronext, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Fidelity
International are among holders in the Multi Commodity Exchange
of India Ltd., the nation&#8217;s largest such exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jaypee Capital Services Ltd., a financial services company
in New Delhi, is considering acquiring a stake, Ramaseshan said,
adding that the exchange isn&#8217;t necessarily talking with Jaypee
about it being an anchor investor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That issue is wide open at this point of time,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jaypee Managing Director Gaurav Arora confirmed talks with
the exchange by phone from Delhi. He declined to provide details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turnover on commodity bourses in India jumped 57 percent to
24.6 trillion rupees in the quarter ended June 30, the regulator
Forward Markets Commission said on its website July 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Commodity  Derivatives Exchange had a daily
average turnover of 27 billion rupees in the three months ended
June, up from 22 billion rupees a year ago, Ramaseshan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stakeholders &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, Intercontinental Exchange Inc. and Shree
Renuka Sugars Ltd., India&#8217;s biggest refiner, each hold a 4
percent stake in NCDEX, according to the exchange&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian rules allows an anchor investor to hold as much as
26 percent in a commodity exchange. Ownership by foreign funds
has been capped at 5 percent for a single investor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Stock Exchange of India Ltd., which holds 15
percent in the National Commodity exchange, needs to lower the
stake to 5 percent by the year end, according to amended rules
published this month by the regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The National Stock Exchange as a shareholder will have to
take a call on how they will go about it,&#8221; said Ramaseshan. &#8220;
NCDEX as an exchange is watched by others, so I am sure there
should be interest,&#8221; in the stake, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life Insurance Corp. of India and the National Bank for
Agriculture and Rural Development each own 15 percent of NCDEX.
Crisil Ltd., a unit of Standard  Poor&#8217;s, and Indian Farmers
Fertiliser Cooperative Ltd., each hold 12 percent, according to
the exchange&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four years ago, Bob Iger, the chief
executive officer of Walt Disney Co., tried to build a cell-
phone business. Disney created a family-oriented service that
included global positioning so parents could track their kids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too few consumers signed up, and the company killed the
operation after 15 months. Disney Interactive, the division that
ran the ill-fated cell service, is still unprofitable. It lost
$55 million last quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger retains his enthusiasm for digital business and has
switched strategies to buying rather than building. He wants to
acquire social games and other online services that come with
customers and talented creators and that will help sell Disney&#8217;s
famous brands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You don&#8217;t get the kind of growth we want by building from
the inside,&#8221; he said in an interview in Bloomberg Businessweek&#8217;s
Aug. 2 edition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since paying $350 million for the kids&#8217; social network Club
Penguin three years ago, Disney has purchased Wideload Games,
whose founder helped create Microsoft&#8217;s hit &#8220;Halo&#8221; franchise.
Early this month, the entertainment giant acquired Tapulous, a
publisher of music-related games for Apple&#8217;s iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney made its biggest video game bet yet on July 27,
agreeing to pay $563 million for closely held Playdom, the
Mountain View, California-based maker of &#8220;Sorority Life&#8221; and
&#8220;Mobsters,&#8221; which are played on Facebook, MySpace and mobile
phones. If Playdom meets performance targets over time, its
founders and investors may receive an additional $200 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast-Growing Venue &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playdom specializes in games that sell virtual goods. In
&#8220;Mobsters,&#8221; players try to build crime syndicates by buying
with real money digital machine guns and henchmen. In &#8220;Sorority
Life,&#8221; players purchase clothing and accessories as they climb
a social ladder. Some 42 million people regularly play Playdom&#8217;s
games each month, according to Disney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities in
Los Angeles, said Playdom will give Disney a potentially fast-
growing venue to sell Disney characters and media brands from
Mickey Mouse to Spider-Man to ESPN. When the Pixar movie &#8220;Cars
2&#8221; is released next June, promotions might include the
soundtrack in a Tapulous-made music game for mobile phones and
the characters woven into Playdom games on Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney said it plans to launch a virtual world based on
&#8220;Cars&#8221; next month. That would be in addition to more
traditional product tie-ins such as plush-toy merchandise, games
for Nintendo Co.&#8217;s Wii console, coverage on ABC and the Disney
Channel, and theme-park rides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking for Knowhow &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re looking for Playdom&#8217;s revenue as
much as they&#8217;re looking for Playdom&#8217;s knowhow&#8221; in working
social games into the Disney mix, Pachter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playdom CEO John Pleasants is moving to Disney, where he
will continue to oversee social-game development and become an
executive vice-president. He will work with Iger&#8217;s point-man for
digital strategy, Steve Wadsworth, who has run Disney&#8217;s Internet
unit since 1999 and assumed video-game oversight in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger said the buy-don&#8217;t-build approach is what drove some
earlier acquisitions. His $8.1 billion purchase of Pixar in 2006
buttressed Disney&#8217;s flagging animation division. The
$4.2 billion acquisition of Marvel Entertainment last year gave
the company, better known for cartoon princesses than
superheroes, iconic comic-book characters that appeal to boys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Club Penguin was its first acquisition of a virtual world.
The site&#8217;s founders run online worlds with monthly subscription
fees and sales of virtual goods. They built the &#8220;Cars&#8221; site
that will launch next month and are overseeing older ones such
as &#8220;Pirates of the Caribbean.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talent on Board &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger has some Internet talent on his board to lean on as he
makes digital deals. Apple CEO Steve Jobs joined as a result of
the Pixar acquisition and is Disney&#8217;s largest shareholder.
Disney was the first to sell TV programs and films on Apple&#8217;s
iTunes online media store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg was tapped
in March to become a director. Disney has since increased its
presence on the social network and experimented with using it to
sell tickets to the Pixar movie &#8220;Toy Story 3.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big media companies typically lose money online. News
Corp.&#8217;s digital media unit lost $150 million in the quarter
ended in March. CBS Corp. stopped breaking out results for
interactive after that unit lost $41.3 million in the first nine
months of 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s the right strategy for Disney to buy,&#8221; says Gina Bianchini, a venture capitalist who co-founded the social
network Ning.com with Marc Andreessen. &#8220;And they are looking at
some very savvy acquisitions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, didn&#8217;t want to take any chances when rules requiring
screening of all U.S. air cargo take effect next week. Neither
did Racine Berkow Associates, a shipper of fine art. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both are among 873 companies that as of last week had
joined a federal program qualifying them to screen their own
goods for air shipping instead of relying on airlines or
freight-handling companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule taking effect Aug. 1 requires checking for
explosives all 4.2 billion pounds of freight shipped on
passenger planes annually within the U.S., plus goods loaded
onto flights headed for international destinations. The
Transportation Security Administration estimates the anti-
terrorist screening may cost $2.8 billion over 10 years.
Carriers such as Delta Air Lines Inc. are charging extra to
customers who leave screening to them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Delays alone could hurt our product,&#8221; Brad Elrod,
Pfizer&#8217;s director of global conveyance security, said in an
interview. &#8220;It could be sitting in non-temperature-controlled
environments. If you open it up to inspect it, you ruin the
product.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It &#8220;became a very simple choice&#8221; for New York-based
Pfizer to seek certification to do its own pre-flight
inspections under the TSA&#8217;s program, Elrod said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inspection requirement, championed by Representative
Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, was part of a 2007 law in
response to the Sept. 11 attacks. All freight going into the
belly of a plane should be checked for explosives just as all
passengers must clear security checkpoints, Markey said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delays, Confusion &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies expect delays and confusion as airlines and
customers struggle to meet the 100 percent inspection standard,
up from a requirement of 75 percent that took effect in May,
said Brandon Fried, executive director of the Airforwarders
Association. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There will be some spotted areas of hardship which might
take a few days to resolve,&#8221; Fried said. Members of his
Washington-based organization include Swiss freight forwarders
Kuehne + Nagel International AG and Panalpina Welttransport
Holding AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Los Angeles International Airport, Chicago&#8217;s O&#8217;Hare
International Airport and New York&#8217;s John F. Kennedy
International Airport are among the 18 largest gateways where
cargo may back up after the deadline, Doug Brittin, the TSA&#8217;s
general manager for air cargo security, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMR Corp.&#8217;s American Airlines, which spent $10 million to
comply, is screening about half the cargo it ships, with the
remainder arriving at the airport already screened, said Dave Brooks, president of the airline&#8217;s cargo unit. The Fort Worth,
Texas-based company&#8217;s cargo division generated 11 percent of its
revenue in the second quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapiscan, Smiths &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American bought seven machines, from London-based Smiths
Group Plc and OSI Systems Inc.&#8217;s Rapiscan unit in Hawthorne,
California, that are capable of screening shrink-wrapped
pallets. Each machine costs about $300,000, Brooks said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapiscan and Smiths, the world&#8217;s biggest manufacturers of
airport scanners, make the only two machines certified by the
U.S. to inspect cargo shipped on pallets. TSA-approved air cargo
inspection is Rapiscan&#8217;s &#8220;largest-growing business and has been
for the last year,&#8221; said Peter Kant, the company&#8217;s executive
vice president, without disclosing sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Racine Berkow, whose Long Island City, New York, company
ships fine art, antiques and museum exhibitions, said she is
worried her fragile and valuable goods may be damaged even
though she met the TSA standards for self-certification. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk of Damage &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This whole thing has been a nightmare,&#8221; Berkow said in
an interview. &#8220;For my cargo, it&#8217;s going to increase the risk of
handling and possibly increase the risk of damage.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies such as Berkow&#8217;s didn&#8217;t have to buy screening
machines. They won TSA certification by training employees in
security procedures and verifying that goods are secure from
packing to airport delivery. The companies attach special
package seals that speed cargo past airport screening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cargo backups next month will be more likely when airlines
are doing the screening at the airport, Brooks of American
Airlines said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will see, probably at a major airport, some cargo get
left behind just because of a miscommunication or a spike in
activity that we weren&#8217;t anticipating,&#8221; Brooks said in an
interview. &#8220;We&#8217;re not going to see the supply chain come to a
screeching halt.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Program&#8217;s Costs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TSA estimates it will pick up a fourth of the costs of
the screening program, with companies bearing the rest. Agency
officials have said they will miss an Aug. 1 deadline for
screening cargo arriving on passenger planes from overseas for
transfer onto domestic flights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delta carried the most cargo among U.S. passenger airlines
last year with 2.29 billion ton miles, an industry measurement
of one ton of cargo carried one mile. About 4 percent consisted
of U.S. mail. Cargo volume fell 20 percent last year from 2008
after the world&#8217;s largest carrier idled the last of its Boeing
Co. 777 freighters because they were becoming too costly to
operate. It now moves freight only on passenger planes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The airline bought screening machines for major hubs and
gateway cities such as Atlanta, Los Angeles and Seattle, and
expanded its cargo staff to offer screening under the rule, said
Anthony Black, a spokesman for Atlanta-based Delta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fee Doubled &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delta more than doubled a cargo-screening fee, to 12 cents
per kilogram from 5 cents, to cover costs for new equipment, the
carrier said in a May letter to freight customers. Customers
that deliver cargo already screened don&#8217;t pay the fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with extra costs, it is usually cheaper to ship air
cargo on passenger planes than on air freighters, which may cost
three to four times as much, according to Fried of the
Airforwarders Association. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc., the largest U.S.
air-freight carriers, are exempt from the inspection
requirements because they fly planes without passengers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imperial Oil Ltd., Exxon Mobil Corp.

&lt;p&gt;Imperial and Exxon will each hold a 25 percent stake in the

&lt;p&gt;The two licenses involved are exploration license 446,

449, awarded to London-based BP in 2008, Rolheiser said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil and other producers have discovered more than
10 billion barrels of oil in North American arctic seas. The
reserves remain locked beneath the seafloor because of a lack of
pipeline capacity to ship them to markets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enel SpA, Italy&#8217;s biggest utility,
plans to hire Mediobanca SpA, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Credit Suisse Group AG to manage the initial public offering of
its Green Power unit, said two people familiar with the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase  Co., Bank of America
Merrill Lynch, UniCredit SpA, Intesa Sanpaolo SpA and BNP
Paribas SA were chosen as joint bookrunners for the IPO, planned
for October, said the people, who declined to be identified
because the talks are private. Barclays Plc was also picked to
manage the sale, one of the people said. The Rome-based utility
hasn&#8217;t yet signed contracts with the banks, said the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enel is planning a 4 billion-euro ($5.2 billion) IPO of its
Green Power division, which manages wind, solar, biomass, hydro
and geothermal power producers in 17 countries, to help repay
debt. The company also is considering selling a stake in the
unit to long-term investors, together with or as an alternative
to the IPO, it said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Enel spokeswoman in Rome declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be the biggest IPO in western Europe since
December 2007, when Iberdrola Renovables SA raised 4.1 billion
euros, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enel Green Power&#8217;s first-half net income rose 13 percent to
253 million euros from 223 million euros a year earlier,
according to the company&#8217;s statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp., the second-biggest
U.S. oil company, said profit tripled, exceeding analysts&#8217;
estimates, after recovering demand for petroleum-based fuels
lifted energy prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second-quarter net income jumped to $5.41 billion, or $2.70
a share, from $1.75 billion, or 87 cents, a year earlier, San
Ramon, California-based Chevron said today in a statement. Per-
share profit was 24 cents higher than the average of 18
analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron follows Exxon Mobil Corp. and ConocoPhillips in
reporting surges in earnings this week after recovering
economies around the world boosted demand for diesel and other
fuels. Refining earnings at Chevron jumped more than sevenfold
to $975 million. U.S. oil futures averaged $78.05 a barrel in
the quarter, up 31 percent from a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a common theme this quarter of riding higher
commodity prices and improved refining and chemical margins,&#8221;
said Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis
who has a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on Chevron shares and doesn&#8217;t own any.
&#8220;I think the company continues to have a good outlook going
forward.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue climbed 32 percent to $53 billion, Chevron said.
Oil and natural-gas production rose 2.8 percent to the
equivalent of 2.75 million barrels of crude a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide demand for oil in the second quarter increased an
estimated 3.2 percent from a year earlier, according to the
International Energy Agency in Paris. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares Rise &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron rose 19 cents to $76.21 as of the 4 p.m. close of
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock, which has
18 buy and 8 hold ratings from analysts, has climbed 13 percent
in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Chief Executive Officer John Watson aims to boost
oil and gas production with wells in places such as the Gulf of
Mexico and Australia. The industry is coping with a moratorium
on new deep-water drilling permits in the U.S. Gulf following an
explosion April 20 at BP Plc&#8217;s Macondo well, which killed 11
workers and caused the biggest oil spill in U.S. history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil, the biggest U.S. oil company, said yesterday
that its second-quarter net income jumped 91 percent to $7.56
billion. ConocoPhillips, the No. 3 U.S. energy producer, said
July 28 that its profit jumped almost fivefold to $4.16 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. named Paul Lee
president of the ABC Entertainment Group, replacing Steve McPherson, who resigned unexpectedly this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee will oversee the ABC Studios and supervise scheduling,
marketing and programming, Burbank, California-based Disney said
today in a statement. A replacement for him at ABC Family, the
cable channel where he was president, will be made in the near
future, Disney said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change comes as the networks promote their slates to
critics at meetings in Beverly Hills, California, ahead of the
TV season that starts in September. ABC presents its lineup on
Aug. 1. Anne Sweeney, president of ABC Television Group, cited
Lee&#8217;s creative instincts and ability to develop programming that
resonates with audiences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Paul&#8217;s success at ABC Family is as amazing as it is
indisputable,&#8221; Sweeney said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABC was the only major U.S. broadcaster to lose viewers
last season and was also down in the 18-to-49-year-old group
that advertisers seek, according to Nielsen Co. The network is
adding six dramas to its schedule starting in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McPherson, in a statement from his publicist, said he would
announce plans that include an &#8220;entrepreneurial venture in the
spirits business&#8221; and &#8220;involvement in a new media company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third among TV networks in prime-time audience, ABC plans
to air new shows including &#8220;Body of Proof&#8221; starring Dana Delany and &#8220;Detroit 1-8-7,&#8221; about a mock-documentary crew that
follows around homicide detectives. The network also picked up
the comedy &#8220;Mr. Sunshine,&#8221; featuring Matthew Perry as manager
of a San Diego sports arena. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comedy Block &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McPherson established a block of comedy shows on Wednesday
nights last TV season that includes three returning programs:
&#8220;Modern Family,&#8221; &#8220;Cougar Town&#8221; and &#8220;The Middle.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network sold about $2.4 billion in ads ahead of the new
season for its full-day schedule, with average prime-time rates
rising 8 percent to 9 percent, a person with knowledge of the
matter said on June 9. ABC sold 75 percent to 80 percent of its
inventory, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By comparison NBC, last in prime-time viewers, sold about
$2.5 billion in advertising, with rates rising about 7 percent,
another person said on June 10. The network pre-sold about 70
percent of its prime-time inventory, that person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s biggest media company, fell 2 cents to
$33.69 at 4:01 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares have climbed 4.5 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. agreed to sell
Miramax to investors including Ronald Tutor and private equity
firm Colony Capital LLC for more than $660 million, ending a
six-month search to find a buyer for the art-house moviemaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale to Filmyard Holding LLC, backed by partners
including construction executive Tutor and Colony, is expected
to be completed by the end of the year, Burbank, California-
based Disney said today in a statement. Disney, the world&#8217;s
largest media company, began winding down Miramax, founded by
brothers Harvey and Bob Weinstein, last October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The sale fits into a much wider logic with studios
reviewing where they can save money by selling some parts of the
business or bringing down budgets for film and reviewing and
redoing actor deals,&#8221; said David Hancock, head of the cinema
market at researcher Screen Digest in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miramax, with rights to more than 700 titles including
Academy Award winners such as &#8220;Chicago&#8221; and &#8220;Shakespeare in
Love,&#8221; was one of several film assets on the block. Liberty
Media Corp. agreed to sell its Overture unit to Relativity Media
LLC last week. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. is seeking buyers after
falling behind on $3.7 billion of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our current strategy for Walt Disney Studios is to focus
on the development of great motion pictures under the Disney,
Pixar and Marvel brands,&#8221; President and Chief Executive Officer
Robert Iger said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney fell 11 cents to $33.60 at 12:24 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock had gained 4.5
percent this year before today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Buyers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tutor, chairman and chief executive of Sylmar, California
based Tutor Perini Corp., began negotiations for Miramax after
Disney ended talks with Los Angeles investor Ron Burkle and the
Weinsteins, who were working on a $625 million offer, people
with knowledge of the situation said earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The new buyers can&#8217;t just mine Miramax&#8217;s existing catalog
so they must have some plans for future production,&#8221; Hancock
said. &#8220;With DVD sales declining and video-on-demand not
contributing as much as was hoped, the value of catalogs have
gone down.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miramax&#8217;s top-grossing film was 2002&#8217;s &#8220;Chicago,&#8221; taking
in about $171 million, followed by 2000&#8217;s &#8220;Scary Movie&#8221; with
$157 million and &#8220;Good Will Hunting&#8221; with $138 million,
according to figures from U.S. researcher Box Office Mojo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Weinsteins sold Miramax, named after their parents
Miriam and Max, to Disney in 1993. The two, who left in 2005,
control rights to some films and are acquainted with both Tutor
and Barrack, according to one of the people. Disney had been
seeking $600 million to $700 million for Miramax. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. will pay $75 million
to settle U.S. regulatory claims that it misled investors by
failing to disclose billions of dollars in holdings tied to
subprime mortgages while the housing crisis unfolded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company made misstatements on earnings calls and in
financial filings in 2007 about assets tied to subprime loans,
the Securities and Exchange Commission said in a federal lawsuit
yesterday in Washington. Some disclosures omitted more than $40
billion in investments, it said. Citigroup&#8217;s former chief
financial officer and head of investor relations agreed to pay a
total of $180,000 for failing to disclose the risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even in late 2007, as the mortgage market was rapidly
deteriorating, Citigroup boasted of superior risk-management
skills in reducing its subprime exposure,&#8221; SEC Enforcement
Director Robert Khuzami said in a statement. &#8220;The rules of
financial disclosure are simple. If you choose to speak, speak
in full and not half truths.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup executives publicly stated four times in 2007
that the New York-based bank had reduced its exposure to
subprime mortgage securities by 45 percent to $13 billion, as
investors and analysts clamored for information about the
deteriorating market. Regulators may investigate other firms
that revised statements about potential exposures and loss
estimates, said Elizabeth Nowicki, a former SEC attorney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are getting a flavor of what they might go after:
overly optimistic disclosures&#8221; said Nowicki, who&#8217;s now a law
professor at Tulane University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former CFO Gary Crittenden, who left Citigroup last year,
agreed to pay $100,000 to settle claims he didn&#8217;t disclose the
risk after getting internal briefings. Arthur Tildesley,
Citigroup&#8217;s former head of investor relations, will pay $80,000
to settle claims that he helped draft disclosures that misled
investors, the SEC said. Tildesley now heads cross-marketing at
Citigroup, according to the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup, Crittenden and Tildesley agreed to settle the
case without admitting or denying the SEC&#8217;s allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Crittenden is pleased to have resolved this matter,&#8221;
said John Carroll, an attorney for Crittenden at law firm
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher  Flom LLP in New York. &#8220;The
settlement does not establish liability for purposes of any
other proceeding.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup is pleased to &#8220;put this matter concerning
certain 2007 disclosures behind us,&#8221; the company said in a
statement that noted it and the executives weren&#8217;t accused of
intentional or reckless misconduct. &#8220;Mr. Tildesley is a highly
valued employee of Citi and is making significant contributions
to the company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tildesley&#8217;s attorney, Mark Stein at Simpson Thacher 
Bartlett LLP in New York, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galleon Prosecutors Held Talks to Resolve Cases &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors told a judge they&#8217;ve had
&#8220;conversations&#8221; to resolve criminal cases against defendants
charged in an alleged insider-trading ring led by former Galleon
Group LLC trader Zvi Goffer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a declaration filed in federal court in Manhattan this
month, Assistant U.S. Attorney Reed Brodsky cited his office&#8217;s
&#8220;conversations with counsel, including cooperating witnesses
and defendants, regarding dispositions in connection with the
Goffer criminal investigation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three-page declaration was filed by Brodsky as part of
an effort to convince a judge that the government&#8217;s criminal
prosecution has been distinct from a civil case brought by the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Brodsky wrote that
prosecutors&#8217; talks have been &#8220;separate and apart from any
conversations between the staff of the SEC and these
individuals.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goffer is among seven people arrested Nov. 5 for trading on
inside tips obtained from lawyers at Ropes  Gray LLP and
elsewhere. One of the seven, David Plate, pleaded guilty on July
16 and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citing Brodsky&#8217;s declaration, U.S. District Judge Richard
Sullivan in Manhattan yesterday denied a request by the criminal
defendants in the Goffer case to obtain documents held by the
SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Goffer, 10-cr-56, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BP Fights U.S., Spill Victims Over Venue for Lawsuits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc, the U.S. and plaintiffs who filed hundreds of
lawsuits seeking billions of dollars for damages stemming from
the largest oil spill in U.S. history are fighting over where
the cases should be heard first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A panel of federal judges in Boise, Idaho, heard arguments
yesterday on which city will host spill suits, including
wrongful-death claims by families of workers killed in the April
explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig. Claims include losses of
revenue by Gulf Coast businesses and securities claims by
holders of U.S. shares in the London-based energy company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government wants the cases consolidated in New Orleans,
in the state where many of those damaged by the oil spill live.
BP prefers Houston, where BP has its U.S. headquarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Orleans &#8220;is the best avenue for justice&#8221; for
thousands of spill victims thrown out of work, Russ Herman, a
lawyer pushing to have the cases consolidated in that city, told
the panel. &#8220;The place that has suffered the most impact
deserves to have the scales balanced.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge tapped to preside over the BP cases will make
crucial rulings on what evidence can be used and which laws
applied. Oil analyst Fadel Gheit, at Oppenheimer  Co.,
estimated yesterday that the damage from the disaster may be as
much as $49 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP faces at least 300 suits over the spill as it works to
permanently plug the Macondo well 40 miles off the coast. Oil
has fouled beaches and marshes in Louisiana, Mississippi,
Alabama, Texas and Florida. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seven-judge Judicial Panel on Multi-District
Litigation, created in 1968, must decide whether lawsuits in
different federal districts have common factual questions that
can be decided once and apply to all cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process is designed to streamline the exchange of
evidence and avoid duplication. Once pretrial proceedings are
completed, the individual cases are sent back for trial in the
courts where they were first filed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main MDL case is In Re Oil Spill by the Oil Rig
&#8220;Deepwater Horizon&#8221; in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010,
MDL Docket No. 2179. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intel Says It May Avoid Class-Action Antitrust Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest chipmaker, said a special
master appointed to review an antitrust lawsuit brought by
computer users recommended rejecting their request for class-
action status. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recommendation will become the court&#8217;s ruling unless
the plaintiffs object within 21 days, Intel spokesman Chuck
Mulloy said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchasers of computers with Intel microprocessors
&#8220;have not established that they will be able to demonstrate an
antitrust violation through common proof,&#8221; Special Master
Vincent J. Poppiti wrote in a report to U.S. District Court in
Wilmington, Delaware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consolidated lawsuit &#8220;generally accuses Intel of
wrongfully offering discounts to computer manufacturers,&#8221;
allegedly inflating prices, according to Mulloy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lead case is Paul v. Intel Corp., 05CV485, U.S.
District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Says Justice Department Weighing Antitrust Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest payments network, fell as
much as 5 percent after saying the U.S. Justice Department may
sue the company over a policy that bars merchants from charging
extra to customers who pay with credit cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The department has indicated that it is considering
filing a civil lawsuit,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer Joseph W.
Saunders said July 28 in a conference call with analysts after
San Francisco-based Visa reported fiscal third-quarter results.
&#8220;We are currently engaged in constructive negotiations with the
department to resolve its concerns as it relates to Visa without
litigation or payment of monetary damages.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa, American Express Co. and Purchase, New York-based
MasterCard Inc. disclosed in 2008 that the Justice Department
was investigating the companies over so-called anti-surcharging
policies and rules prohibiting merchants from &#8220;steering&#8221;
customers to other forms of payment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department&#8217;s antitrust division is
&#8220;investigating whether certain credit-card network rules
regarding merchants&#8217; treatment of various payment forms,
including credit cards, are anticompetitive,&#8221; spokeswoman Gina

&lt;p&gt;Ex-New Star Fund Manager Can Sue Over &#8216;Bullying&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick Evershed, a former New Star Asset Management
Holdings Inc. fund manager, can proceed with a lawsuit over
claims he was bullied by company founder John Duffield, a London
court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evershed, 69, can pursue whistleblowing and unfair
dismissal claims against the fund, a London appeals court ruled
yesterday. New Star had sought to dismiss the whistleblowing
claim, which allows Evershed to seek unlimited damages. Most
U.K. unfair dismissal claims are capped at about 65,000 pounds
($101,000). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evershed wrote a letter to New Star&#8217;s human resources
department complaining of Duffield&#8217;s conduct in 2008. Evershed
was suspended by the fund&#8217;s chief executive officer, Howard
Covington, shortly after, he said, according to the judgment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Star has denied the allegations and said that Evershed
resigned, according to the judgment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is New Star v. Evershed, No. A2/2009/1841, Court
of Appeal (Civil Division), on appeal from the Employment Appeal
Tribunal (London). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Hevesi Aide to Face Trial on Most Pension Counts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henry &#8220;Hank&#8221; Morris, the former chief political adviser
to New York&#8217;s ex-comptroller, must go to trial on most of the 90
charges against him stemming from a probe of the state&#8217;s pension
fund, a judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morris, who advised former comptroller Alan Hevesi, is
accused of corrupting the investment process at the pension fund
to favor deals that would benefit himself, his associates and
contributors to Hevesi&#8217;s campaign. Hevesi hasn&#8217;t been accused of
wrongdoing in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State Supreme Court Justice Lewis Bart Stone in Manhattan
yesterday threw out 13 counts, including grand larceny and
falsifying documents. Morris still faces an enterprise
corruption charge that carries a prison term of as long as 25
years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grand jury heard &#8220;sufficient evidence&#8221; to sustain
most of the charges, Stone wrote in his decision. The grand jury
heard that Morris created a corrupt operation in which decisions
about which funds to invest in were based on whether the fund
&#8220;agreed to pay placement fees or share management fees with
Morris rather than solely on the prudent investor rule,&#8221; the
judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Schwartz, an attorney for Morris, declined to
comment as he left the courtroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Morris case is at the center of New York Attorney
General Andrew Cuomo&#8217;s investigation of corruption at the state
retirement fund. Six people have pleaded guilty to criminal
charges in the probe, including David Loglisci, former chief
investment officer at the pension fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen firms have settled and agreed to a code of conduct
drafted by Cuomo that bans so-called placement agents from
obtaining investments from public pension funds and limits
campaign contributions to those with the power to assign
investment business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is People v. Morris, 0025/2009, New York State
Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prudential Insurance Sued Over Veterans&#8217; Benefits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prudential Insurance Co. of America was sued over claims it
earns interest of more than 5.69 percent on veterans&#8217; life-
insurance policies and pays beneficiaries only 1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insurer, a unit of Prudential Financial Inc. &#8220;paid to
beneficiaries on the accrued claims only one percent interest on
the accrued monies as of the day of death or traumatic injury of
the insured,&#8221; according to the lawsuit, filed yesterday in
federal court in Springfield, Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit seeks class-action, or group, status. It was
brought by Kevin and Joyce Lucey, the beneficiaries of a
$250,000 life insurance policy for their son, Jeffrey Lucey, a
former member of the armed forces who died in 2004, according to
the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs said July 28 it is
investigating life insurance companies&#8217; practice of putting
veterans&#8217; death benefits in corporate accounts and keeping most
of the investment profits instead of paying the survivors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Luceys were paid $53,000 in 2004, and the balance of the
policy, or $197,000, in 2009, and an added one percent annual
interest rate when the funds were distributed, according to the
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interest accrued during the delay &#8220;is money that
doesn&#8217;t belong to Prudential,&#8221; Cristobal Bonifaz, a lawyer
representing plaintiffs, said in a phone interview. &#8220;If you
delay the payment, you better turn that money over.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob DeFillippo, a spokesman for Newark, New Jersey-based
Prudential Insurance, the second-largest U.S. life insurer, said
the company hasn&#8217;t seen the lawsuit and declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Lucey v. Prudential Insurance Co. of America,
10-30163, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts
(Springfield). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff Family Members&#8217; Companies Sued by Bankruptcy Trustee &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies owned by members of Bernard Madoff&#8217;s family
should pay tens of millions of dollars to help victims of his
Ponzi scheme, the trustee recovering funds for investors said in
three lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff&#8217;s family members used the money to fund their
personal business ventures, trustee Irving H. Picard said in the
complaints filed yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York.
The companies include a hedge fund, a biotechnology company,
energy companies, and Primex Holdings LLC, a company designed to
replicate an auction process, according to the filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Foremost among the recipients of Madoff&#8217;s gifts of
customer funds were his closest family members, including his
wife Ruth Madoff, his brother Peter, his two sons Andrew and
Mark, and his niece Shana,&#8221; Picard said in one of the
complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to using almost $250 million of customer funds
from the fraud at Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC to
fund their lavish lifestyles, Picard said in the filings that he
seeks to recover millions funneled from BLMIS to finance the
family members&#8217; personal business ventures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 72, is serving a 150-year term in federal prison in
Butner, North Carolina, after pleading guilty to orchestrating
history&#8217;s biggest Ponzi scheme. When Madoff was arrested in
December 2008, account statements showed $65 billion in
nonexistent client investments in 4,900 accounts, according to
Picard. Investors lost about $20 billion in principal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard, who has so far recovered $1.5 billion for Madoff&#8217;s
victims and other creditors, didn&#8217;t return a call seeking
comment after regular business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Flumenbaum, an attorney who has represented Madoff&#8217;s
sons in earlier cases, and Peter Chavkin, a lawyer for Ruth
Madoff, didn&#8217;t return calls after business hours yesterday.
Charles Spada, a lawyer for Peter Madoff, also didn&#8217;t return a
call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the adversary cases is Irving H. Picard v. Madoff
Family LLC, 10-03485, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District
of New York (Manhattan). The Madoff bankruptcy case is In re
Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, 09-11893, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kebble Chose Being Shot Over Poison to Avoid Jail, Court Hears &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Murdered South African mining magnate Brett Kebble
considered poisoning himself before opting to be gunned down to
avoid jail, a Johannesburg court heard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When three men were commissioned to shoot him five years
ago, Kebble, who had been forced to resign as chief executive
officer of three mining companies, faced a probe after assets
worth hundreds of millions of dollars went missing from Randgold
 Exploration Ltd. At the time, he also led JCI Ltd. and Western
Areas Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an 11-year career in South Africa&#8217;s gold mining
industry, Kebble, who died at the age of 41, helped set up two
of the country&#8217;s four biggest gold companies, Harmony Gold
Mining Co. and DRDGold Ltd. Investec Ltd., a bank, and fund
manager Allan Gray Ltd., a shareholder in Kebble&#8217;s companies,
pressed for his departure after the assets went missing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Brett pleaded with me,&#8221; Clinton Nassif, who yesterday
told the South Gauteng High court that he arranged Kebble&#8217;s
killing. &#8220;He was at his wit&#8217;s end with all the trouble.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Stratton, a former JCI director, helped Kebble look
for a lethal pill &#8220;that wouldn&#8217;t show up in an autopsy,&#8221; said
Nassif, who worked as a security manager for convicted drug
dealer Glenn Agliotti. Agliotti has pleaded not guilty to
ordering Nassif to have Kebble&#8217;s murder carried out at the
mining magnate&#8217;s request, describing it as an &#8220;assisted
suicide.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Kanarek, a lawyer for Agliotti, declined to comment
yesterday. Agliotti faces charges of murder and conspiracy to
murder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is State versus Agliotti, Norbert Glenn, JPV
2008/264, SS154/2009. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hays, CDI Seek Reversal of 38 Million Pounds in Fines &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hays Plc, Britain&#8217;s largest recruitment company, and U.S.
competitor CDI Corp. asked a U.K. appeals court to overturn a
total of 38 million pounds ($59.4 million) in price-fixing fines
related to their work in the construction industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fines, levied last year by the Office of Fair Trading,
were excessive and based on miscalculations of revenue generated
by the scheme, a lawyer for Hays said at the Competition Appeal
Tribunal in London yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hays&#8217;s fine was based on &#8220;a fundamental misunderstanding&#8221;
of how the company conducts business and the type of contract it
uses to match clients with workers, Mark Brealey, Hays&#8217;s lawyer
with the firm Brick Court Chambers, said at the hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hays, based in London, was fined 30.4 million pounds, while
Philadelphia-based CDI was fined 7.6 million pounds for fixing
fees with other companies in the cartel and agreeing to boycott
another competitor from 2004 to 2006. The fines include
discounts of as much as 35 percent because the companies
admitted to joining the scheme and cooperated with the OFT. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AB InBev Loses EU Bid to Expand Budweiser Trademark Right &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anheuser-Busch InBev NV, the world&#8217;s largest brewer, lost a
last court bid to extend its trademark rights to the name
Budweiser for beer across the European Union in a century-old
dispute with Budejovicky Budvar NP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Court of Justice rejected AB InBev&#8217;s bid to
get a region-wide trademark and the exclusive right to use
Budweiser for beer and some other drinks, because of Budvar&#8217;s
existing rights to the name in Austria and Germany. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Czech competitor Budvar&#8217;s challenge to AB InBev&#8217;s trademark
application was valid, a five-judge panel said, rejecting a
claim that Budvar had failed to bring enough proof of its
earlier right in some EU countries. The Luxembourg-based EU
tribunal&#8217;s decision is final and can&#8217;t be appealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is part of a fight between the two breweries going
back to the early 1900s over the rights to use the names Bud and
Budweiser for beer, merchandising and other products. AB InBev,
which owns the trademark rights for Bud or Budweiser in 23 of
the 27 EU countries, applied 14 years ago to expand its rights
to the Budweiser name across the entire region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This judgment has no effect on Anheuser-Busch InBev&#8217;s
business in Europe or our existing Bud and Budweiser rights,
which remain strong and intact,&#8221; Marianne Amssoms, the Leuven,
Belgium-based company&#8217;s spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. &#8220;Filing
this application was an effort to further expand our extensive
trademark rights and gain additional protections that we
continue to believe are rightfully ours.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Budvar says it owns the rights because its beer comes from
the Czech town Ceske Budejovice, or Budweis in German. Anheuser-
Busch, which first applied for the EU-wide trademark for
Budweiser in 1996, took its fight to the EU&#8217;s top court after
losing at a lower EU court last year and at the EU trademark
agency in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is C-214/09 P Anheuser-Busch v Office for
Harmonisation in the Internal Market, Budejovicky Budvar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WestLB Board Members Will Pay 445,000 Euros to Settle Probe &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current and former WestLB AG managers agreed to pay 445,000
euros ($582,238) to settle a criminal probe over trading losses
the lender incurred in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement resolves a probe into 600 million euros in
losses WestLB had from speculative proprietary trading, Johannes
Mocken, a spokesman for Dusseldorf, Germany, prosecutors, said
in an interview yesterday. A court approved the agreement, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The losses stem from transactions in which WestLB&#8217;s traders
were betting the gap between common and preferred shares of
companies such as Volkswagen AG would narrow. Prosecutors were
investigating the managers for failing to inform the supervisory
board about the trading risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Chief Executive Officer Thomas Fischer, who was
fired over the issue, will have to pay 150,000 euros under the
accord, Mocken said. Werner Taiber and Hans-Juergen Niehaus, who
are both still on WestLB&#8217;s management board, agreed to pay
150,000 and 75,000 euros, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There was absolutely no wrongdoing here at all and I
would have loved to litigate the case,&#8221; said Eckhard Hild,
Fischer&#8217;s lawyer. &#8220;But because this was the shorter way to end
it, my client chose it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taiber and Niehaus didn&#8217;t reply to a request for comment
left at their office. WestLB&#8217;s press office didn&#8217;t return a call
requesting comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probes against two traders who engaged in the transactions
are still pending, Mocken said. He didn&#8217;t identify the traders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is LG Duesseldorf, 10 KLS / 130 Js 30/10-8/10. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a small, windowless room in the
basement of International Business Machines Corp.&#8217;s Almaden lab
in Silicon Valley, Dharmendra Modha is building a simulated
monkey brain using images projected on flat-screen TVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modha, the lab&#8217;s manager of cognitive computing, urged Big
Blue to back his pet project, which combines advances in
nanotechnology, supercomputing and neuroscience. If successful,
the effort could help computers &#8220;think&#8221; like the human mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM green-lights proposals from Modha and other researchers
at the San Jose, California, facility because some of the
gambles can spawn significant business. Since the 1990s, lab
advances in how data is stored, managed and analyzed have helped
generate millions of dollars in sales. Yet even lab directors
concede chances are slim that any one breakthrough will make a
sizable addition to IBM&#8217;s almost $100 billion in annual revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have no way of making money off of this -- unless a
miracle happens and we figure out how to make better
computers,&#8221; said Laura Haas, director of computer science at
Almaden and the lab&#8217;s second-in-command, who wears a &#8220;Question
Authority&#8221; button. &#8220;We&#8217;re different. It takes a different kind
of craziness here.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While IBM may move at a slower pace than smaller West Coast
startups, it aims to give Almaden researchers as much leeway as
their Silicon Valley peers, said Winfried Wilcke, senior manager
of the lab&#8217;s nanoscale science and technology research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you think of us as dinosaurs, then think of us as
velociraptors,&#8221; he said, referring to the nimble predators of
the Late Cretaceous period. &#8220;The freedom we have here is
great.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mixed Results &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silicon Valley labs have a mixed record of getting a
payback -- a high return on investment -- from their
discoveries. While IBM was able to capitalize on Almaden&#8217;s
invention of the disk drive and relational database, many of
Xerox Corp.&#8217;s early innovations at its Palo Alto Research Center
-- such as the Macintosh-style graphical user interface --
brought more benefit to other companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Making some bets that are unlinked to specific outcomes
is important, but if it&#8217;s all kind of curiosity-driven research,
the ROI on innovation investing may not be that high,&#8221; said
John Kao, chairman of the Institute for Large Scale Innovation
in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some investors say IBM needs big deals more than research
to increase revenue. While the company has boosted earnings per
share through such steps as buybacks and cost controls, rivals
Oracle Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. have eclipsed its stock-
price performance in part through big purchases that added to
sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research, Dealmaking &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Sam Palmisano became chief executive officer of IBM
in 2002, it spent $25 billion buying publicly held companies.
Compare that with at least $45 billion for Hewlett-Packard and
$42 billion for Oracle. IBM stock has risen 25 percent in the
Palmisano era, compared with 53 percent for Oracle and 128
percent for Hewlett-Packard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmisano said in May that he plans to spend $20 billion
more on acquisitions in the next five years. On Palmisano&#8217;s
watch, IBM also has increased its research spending by 31
percent. Last year, it devoted $5.8 billion, about 6 percent of
annual revenue, to RD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Silicon Valley version of IBM fosters a freer attitude
and more of a startup mentality than headquarters in Armonk, New
York. While the century-old IBM is known for white shirts, dark
suits and button-downed attitude, the staff at Almaden tackles
oddball research projects and unwinds by holding sack races and
tug-of-war competitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Crazy Scientists&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Located on a hill in a 1,600-acre wildlife preserve, the
Almaden lab is painted a custom dark-green color derived from
leaves and grass that employees gathered on site. The lobby
boasts a 5-foot-diameter digital display globe that was
purchased after researchers saw a similar device at a Denver
museum and thought it would be &#8220;cool&#8221; to have one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;New York was like, &#8216;You crazy scientists can do this, but
come August, you have show us results,&#8217;&#8221; said Julia Grace, a
social and collaborative computing engineer. The globe has been
used to plot last year&#8217;s swine flu outbreak and more recently to
show the location of people sending messages delivered via
Twitter Inc. during World Cup soccer matches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almaden&#8217;s projects include an electric battery for
automobiles that could run 500 miles on one charge, a filtration
system for desalination and a program that shows changes in
geographical data. Researchers can shake up an industry, even if
they don&#8217;t make a fortune, Haas said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;re not going to get rich, but you can change the
world,&#8221; she said. &#8220;IBM is a big ship, and you need a certain
amount of patience to turn the wheel. But if that ship turns,
the wake in the industry is enormous.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM Fellows &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees at the lab consider themselves &#8220;wild ducks&#8221; for
working on projects that don&#8217;t fit in with what headquarters in
New York wants to pursue, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almaden has a &#8220;better sense of &#8216;the next big thing&#8217;&#8221;
because of its location, said Mark Dean, IBM&#8217;s vice president of
strategy, who works at the Watson lab in Yorktown Heights, New
York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s the only place in IBM where we&#8217;re doing advanced
battery research,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The only place we&#8217;re doing water
desalination.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of IBM&#8217;s nine research centers, Almaden also is the only
one to hold an annual Olympics-style event, where IBM Fellows --
the highest technical honor a researcher can receive at the
company -- compete with interns in athletic events. Competition
for the first-place trophy is so fierce that research team
directors taunt each other in self-directed videos by breaking
wooden boards with their hands or donning Star Trek uniforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High Expectations &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with its renegade spirit, Almaden is under growing
pressure to produce results, said David Patterson, a computer
science professor at the University of California, Berkeley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People expect more product impact from their research
labs than they did 20 to 30 years ago,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1990s, Almaden developed a method of encryption for
media content. Used in memory cards and Blu-ray discs, this
technology has earned IBM millions of dollars in licensing fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giant magnetoresistive heads, introduced in 1997, helped
hard disk drives increase their data-storage capacity 40-fold. A
query system developed at Almaden in the late 1990s, named
Garlic, integrates data from multiple sources and has earned IBM
hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. More recently, the
lab developed a file-management system called GPFS that IBM now
adds to its archiving, networking and cloud computing products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, technology companies continue to fund research
without knowing where it will lead. Mountain View, California-
based Google lets its workers spend 20 percent of their time
working on personal projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Productivity Gain &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve found that people are more productive when they are
working on projects that really excite them,&#8221; said Jordan
Newman, a Google spokesman. Products including Google News and
Gmail got their start that way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At IBM, some projects don&#8217;t pan out. In the early 1990s,
Haas and IBM&#8217;s database management team wanted to figure out a
way of searching the World Wide Web, something that hadn&#8217;t
emerged yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If we did it right, we might have invented search before
Google,&#8221; Haas said. &#8220;But we had the wrong model, and we
totally missed the boat. We were thinking about librarians.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modha, the researcher working on the monkey brain, quit IBM
a decade ago in order to work on his own startup. After a short
time, he realized he didn&#8217;t have the financial acumen to run a
business and returned to Almaden. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have a 100-year history,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The challenge
is, how do we usher in the next 100 years?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. lowered by 5.5
percent its forecast for New York oil prices this year on
speculation a slowdown in global economies will limit crude&#8217;s
potential to rise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank cut to $77.25 a barrel its estimate for the
average price of West Texas Intermediate crude on the New York
Mercantile Exchange during the rest of 2010, from a forecast of
$81.75 a barrel made last month, according to a monthly report
e-mailed today. It lowered its forecast for 2011&#8217;s average
price to $79.25 a barrel from $90. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see both lower prices and a tighter range ahead --
but with increased risks,&#8221; Lawrence Eagles, an analyst for the
U.S. bank, wrote in the report. &#8220;Weaker economic growth,
energy efficiency and Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries intransigence provide downside risks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude may fall next week amid increases in U.S. supplies
and OPEC production, a Bloomberg News survey showed. Crude oil
has declined by 0.5 percent this year to $78.95 a barrel in New
York, after rising 78 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s an increased drive towards energy efficiency and
renewable energy in China,&#8221; said Henry Wang, managing director,
of Beijing-based energy consultant Gate International Ltd.
&#8220;This could create downward pressure on oil demand.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pressure on China&#8217;s oil demand, the world&#8217;s biggest energy
user, affects global consumption, which may impact prices, Wang,
who formerly worked for Royal Dutch Shell Plc. in China, said
by phone from Beijing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production Cuts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The absence of &#8220;significant&#8221; demand recovery in markets
such as North America and Europe prompted Singapore-based Tri-
Zen International Ltd. to cut its forecast in April for Brent
Crude to $75 a barrel this year, said Tony Regan, a consultant
in an e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil prices may fall more than expected on lower demand and
a risk OPEC member nations won&#8217;t adhere to production cuts,
JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If demand drops, the Gulf Trio, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and
the United Arab Emirates are likely to demand cuts from &#8216;leaky&#8217;
members to rebalance the market, but any delay in response
risks a fall in prices as low as $50 a barrel,&#8221; Eagles said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The demand outlook in the projection has been moderated in
recent months because of shifts in the bank&#8217;s economic
forecasts, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This month sees further changes, which take down 2010
demand growth to 1.8 million barrels a day and 2011 to a
&#8216;trend&#8217; 1.5 million barrels a day,&#8221; Eagles said. &#8220;The net sum
of our supply and demand changes reduces the call on OPEC by
1.2 million barrels a day at the end of 2011.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ABC has its &#8220;work cut out&#8221; to
reverse a decline in ratings, said Paul Lee, the executive named
last week to lead the Walt Disney Co. television network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee headed Disney&#8217;s ABC Family cable channel until Steve McPherson unexpectedly resigned as president of ABC
Entertainment Group on July 27. The executive, who introduced
shows like &#8220;Pretty Little Liars&#8221; aimed at young female viewers
at ABC Family, said he will &#8220;take some risks&#8221; in his new role
to pull the broadcast network out of third place. He stopped
short of saying he&#8217;d target a millennial demographic at ABC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The way to program a cable network is to do one thing and
do it well,&#8221; Lee told writers at the semi-annual Television
Critics Association today in Beverly Hills, California. &#8220;A
broadcast network is a much larger canvas.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee said he will seek to create a brand identity at ABC,
much as CBS has done with procedural dramas and Fox with shows
that appeal to younger men. He said ABC, the only major
broadcaster to decline in ratings last season, is known for
&#8220;smart&#8221; programs. He mentioned &#8220;Dancing With the Stars,&#8221; and
shows he called &#8220;sexy&#8221; like &#8220;Grey&#8217;s Anatomy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The London-born Lee, 50, founded the BBC America cable
channel before joining Disney in 2004. He said he was
vacationing with his wife on a California beach when he was
approached to take the ABC job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You have more time in cable to stick with a show,&#8221; Lee
said. &#8220;But we are always a slave to ratings.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABC was the only major U.S. broadcaster to lose viewers
last season and was also down in the 18-to-49-year-old group
that advertisers seek, according to Nielsen Co. The network is
adding six dramas to its schedule starting in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Body of Proof&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new shows include  including &#8220;Body of Proof,&#8221;
starring Dana Delany, and &#8220;Detroit 1-8-7,&#8221; which revolves
around a homicide unit in the city. It also picked up the comedy
&#8220;Mr. Sunshine,&#8221; featuring Matthew Perry as the manager of a
San Diego sports arena. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Paul has been very supportive of us so far, just as Steve
was,&#8221; said Jason Richman, executive producer of &#8220;Detroit 1-8-
7,&#8221; which will air on Tuesdays. &#8220;We&#8217;re just going to continue
to do what we&#8217;ve been doing,&#8221; added David Zabel, the show&#8217;s
other executive producer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McPherson established a block of comedy shows on Wednesday
nights last TV season that includes three returning programs:
&#8220;Modern Family,&#8221; &#8220;Cougar Town&#8221; and &#8220;The Middle.&#8221; Lee
predicted that &#8220;Modern Family,&#8221; nominated for the Emmy award
for best comedy, will win. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Upfront Sales&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABC sold about $2.4 billion in ads ahead of the new season
for its full-day schedule, with average prime-time rates rising
8 percent to 9 percent, a person with knowledge of the matter
said on June 9. ABC sold 75 percent to 80 percent of its
inventory, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By comparison NBC, last in prime-time viewers, sold about
$2.5 billion in advertising, with rates rising about 7 percent,
another person said on June 10. The network pre-sold about 70
percent of its prime-time inventory, that person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s largest media company, fell 2 cents to
$33.69 on July 30 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
The shares have climbed 4.5 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
