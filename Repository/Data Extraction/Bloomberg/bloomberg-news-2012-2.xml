<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Vice

<p>The bonus for Sherwood, co-chief of the bank in London, was
34 percent down on last year and will be transferred to him over
three years, the Times said. The bonus is in addition to $2.5

<p>Pfizer Inc. and Ranbaxy Laboratories
Ltd. (RBXY) were sued in an antitrust case filed in federal court in
New York alleging the drugmakers engaged in an anti-competitive
scheme to delay a generic version of Lipitor into the market. </p>
<p>The AFL-AGC Building Trades Welfare plan, a health and
welfare benefit plan based in Mobile, Alabama, claims that two
drugmakers engaged in a monopolization scheme after the Pfizer''s
original patent for the cholesterol-lowering drug expired on
March 24, 2010. </p>
<p>In the proposed class-action, or group, lawsuit, the
plaintiffs allege the drug companies agreed to delay the entry
of generic Lipitor for 20 months. As a result of an unlawful
agreement with generic-maker Ranbaxy, Pfizer cost purchasers to
pay more for Lipitor than they would have paid for the generic
version of the drug. </p>
<p>Defendants'' scheme was successful -- generic Lipitor did
not become available for sale until November 2011, the
plaintiffs said. As a result of defendants'' illegal acts,
plaintiffs and the indirect purchaser class were forced to pay
billions of dollars more for Lipitor than they would have absent
defendants'' anticompetitive scheme. </p>
<p>Both drugmakers were sued in a complaint making similar
allegations filed in federal court in San Francisco by 11
California pharmacies in November. In that case, the plaintiffs
alleged that they held back on a generic version of the
cholesterol-lowering drug in the U.S. and then fixed its price. </p>
<h2>Inflated Costs </h2>
<p>Lipitor sells for more than $4 a day compared with prices
as low as 10 cents day for the generic, the drug stores said in
their complaint. Lipitor''s purchasers in the U.S. are paying
inflated costs as a result, the pharmacies said. </p>
<p>Sales of Lipitor generated $10.7 billion in revenue for New
York-based Pfizer in 2010. A legal settlement with Pfizer gave
New Delhi-based Ranbaxy six months'' exclusivity to market
generic Lipitor, the world''s best-selling drug. </p>
<p>The lawsuit seeks disgorgement of profits from the
allegedly illegal arrangement and triple damages. </p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission reviewed the terms of the
2008 settlement, Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman said in a
telephone interview. Pfizer believes the suit has no merit. We
are confident that the Lipitor patent settlement with Ranbaxy is
appropriate, he said. </p>
<p>Chuck Caprariello, a spokesman for Ranbaxy, didn''t
immediately return a voice-mail message left at his office
seeking comment on the complaint. </p>
<p>The case is AFL-AGC Building Trades Welfare Plan, v. Pfizer
Inc. (PFE) 12-CV-931, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>General Electric Co.''s financial
services unit was sued by units of AerCap Holdings NV (AER) for
allegedly failing to tell the aircraft-leasing company about a
lawsuit in Brazil. </p>
<p>According to a complaint filed Feb. 3 in New York State
Supreme Court in Manhattan, a lawyer for General Electric
Capital Corp. told AerCap in February 2010 that the company was
liable for millions of dollars in a court case involving
Transbrasil SA, the bankrupt Brazilian airline. </p>
<p>The airline had sued GE and AerCap in February 2001 to void
promissory notes issued in 1999 in connection with the leases of
two engines and an aircraft, according to the complaint. GE lost
an appeal of a 2007 judgment entered against AerCap and other
defendants, and Transbrasil is asking Brazilian courts to
enforce the judgment, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>GE had concealed from AerCap that it was named as a
defendant in the lawsuit and had directed the defense of the
lawsuit -- with catastrophic results -- without AerCap''s
knowledge or consent since 2001, AerCap said in the complaint. </p>
<p>Transbrasil has said the appeals court decision entitles it
to about $223 million, including interest, from AerCap and other
defendants, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>General Electric hasn''t been served with the lawsuit and
doesn''t comment on pending litigation, Daniel Whitney, a
spokesman for GE Capital Aviation Services, said in an e-mail. </p>

Corp., 650341/2012, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, reached a preliminary agreement to pay $110
million to settle litigation saying it gouged customers on
overdraft fees for checking accounts, court records show. </p>
<p>The settlement would resolve claims by customers including
Andrea Luquetta of Los Angeles, who sued over fees charged to
debit cards attached to her checking account. U.S. District
Judge James Lawrence King in Miami must approve any settlement.
King had earlier rejected arguments by various banks that
customers were legally bound to arbitrate the dispute. </p>
<p>We''re pleased to have reached an agreement in
principle, Patrick Linehan, a JPMorgan spokesman, said in an
e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>The litigation before King involves more than 30 banks sued
over their overdraft-fee policies. The customers say the banks
reorder debit-card transactions in their computers to maximize
overdraft fees. Bank of America Corp., the second-biggest U.S.
bank by assets, agreed last year to pay $410 million without
admitting liability to settle an overdraft lawsuit brought by
its customers. </p>
<p>In her lawsuit, filed in 2009, Luquetta claimed JPMorgan
engaged in unfair, deceptive and unconscionable assessment
and collection of overdraft fees. Her complaint also refers to
the practices of Washington Mutual Inc., which JPMorgan bought
in 2008. </p>
<h2>Insufficient Funds </h2>
<p>Chase didn''t decline debit transactions when a customer had
insufficient funds and didn''t warn them an overdraft fee would
be charged, Luquetta alleged. Rather, Chase routinely charged
customers overdraft fees of $25 to $35 for transactions of only
a few dollars, according to the amended complaint. </p>
<p>Chase and Washington Mutual either refused to allow their
customers to opt out of overdraft protection, or failed to
adequately disclose to their customers that they may do so,
according to the complaint, which sought to proceed as a class-
action, or group, lawsuit. </p>
<p>In many instances, these overdraft fees cost the banks''
account holders hundreds of dollars in a matter of days, or even
hours, when they may be overdrawn by only a few dollars, it
claimed. </p>
<p>In September 2009, Chase announced several changes to its
overdraft fees for debit cards. </p>
<p>It eliminated overdrafts unless a customer elects the
service, modified the posting order of charges to recognize
debit-card transactions and ATM withdrawals as they occur, ended
fees for accounts overdrawn by $5 or less, and reduced the
maximum number of fees per day to three from six. </p>
<h2>Arbitration </h2>
<p>Last September, King ruled that customers of SunTrust Banks
Inc., MT Bank Corp., Regions Financial Corp. and Branch Banking
 Trust Co. can use the federal courts rather than arbitration
to pursue overdraft claims. He said a U.S. Supreme Court ruling
last April in ATT Mobility LLC v. Concepcion didn''t require
arbitration in every case. </p>
<p>In October, a federal appeals court ruled that King should
consider the JPMorgan case in light of the Concepcion ruling.
The judge, the appeals court ruled, should have limited the
pretrial collection of evidence to issues bearing
significantly on the arbitrability of this dispute until the
question of arbitrability has been decided. </p>
<p>Bruce Rogow, a lead attorney for the JPMorgan Chase
customers, wouldn''t comment on the accord. Another lead
attorney, Robert Gilbert, didn''t return a phone call or e-mail
seeking comment. </p>
<h2>Largest Settlement </h2>
<p>Bank of America''s settlement, finalized in November, is the
largest thus far in the litigation. The accord won court
approval despite objections the amount was too little for
customers and lawyers were being paid too much. </p>
<p>Union Bank NA agreed to a $35 million settlement with
customers in November; an Associated Banc-Corp. unit,
Associated Bank, agreed in November to pay $13 million. </p>
<p>The case is In re Checking Account Overdraft Litigation,
09-md-02036, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida
(Miami). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan
Stanley will rewrite their so-called clawback policies to make
it clear they will reclaim pay from supervisors as well as from
employees who take excessive risk or engage in improper conduct. </p>
<p>Memos from both firms confirming the planned changes,
responding to a December shareholder request from New York City
pension funds, were posted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission''s website. The New York-based companies said
regulators are drafting clawback rules, which may satisfy the
city''s request for disclosure of how much pay the banks take
back. Dow Jones Newswires reported on the changes earlier today. </p>
<p>These two firms have set the standard for clawback
policies in the banking industry, New York City Comptroller
John C. Liu, who oversaw $113 billion in pension funds as of
Nov. 30, said in a statement today. We appreciate the dialogue
we''ve had on this issue and will continue to call for them to
disclose the amount of clawbacks if forthcoming regulation does
not require it. </p>
<p>Liu filed shareholder requests with Goldman Sachs, Morgan
Stanley (MS) and New York-based JPMorgan Chase  Co. seeking tougher
clawbacks after each paid more than $100 million over 18 months
to settle charges of improper conduct tied to mortgage-backed
securities. Spokesmen at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the
fifth- and sixth-biggest U.S. banks by assets, declined to
comment. JPMorgan''s Joe Evangelisti didn''t immediately respond
to a request for comment. The company is the biggest U.S. bank
by assets. </p>
<p>Michael Garland, the New York City comptroller''s executive
director for corporate governance, withdrew the shareholder
proposals made to Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley after they
agreed to change the language in their policies, according to
memos posted on the SEC''s website. </p>
<p>Liu hired Garland to the new position in September 2010.
Garland had served as director of value strategies for the CtW
Investment Group, which he co-founded within Change to Win, a
federation of unions that represented 5.5 million U.S. workers. </p>

<p>Hawker Beechcraft Inc., the jet maker
partly owned by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), named turnaround
specialist Steve Miller as chief executive officer as the
company works to avoid breaching debt covenants. </p>
<p>Miller''s hiring spurred American International Group Inc. (AIG),
the bailed-out insurer for which he is chairman, to review
succession plans. Miller, 70, was designated in 2010 to serve as
interim CEO at AIG in the event that Robert Benmosche has to
step down while fighting cancer. </p>
<p>The new chief takes over immediately at Wichita, Kansas-
based Hawker Beechcraft, which has been close to violating loan
terms as a softer global economy saps business-aircraft demand.
Hawker Beechcraft hired Perella Weinberg Partners LP as a
financial adviser in December, and its bonds have been tumbling. </p>
<p>They are working to address their debt situation, so it''s
not surprising that they would look to bring in outside people
to help, Christopher DeNicolo, a Standard  Poor''s credit
analyst in New York, said in an interview today. The market
for small- and mid-sized business jets is still fairly weak. </p>
<p>Miller succeeds Bill Boisture, who will remain chairman of
subsidiary Hawker Beechcraft Corp. Nicole Alexander, a company
spokeswoman, didn''t immediately return a phone call or e-mail
seeking comment on whether Miller will lead a restructuring. </p>
<h2>Revolving Credit </h2>
<p>The maker of Hawker-brand business jets was in compliance
with debt covenants as of Dec. 12, Alexander said at the time.
She also said then that the company probably would need to
address our revolving credit agreement. </p>
<p>Hawker Beechcraft''s 9.75 percent notes due in April 2017
fell 4 cents to 8 cents on the dollar at 2:02 p.m. in New York,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. </p>
<p>DeNicolo said Hawker Beechcraft may continue to face debt
covenant compliance issues, and a $1.4 billion debt maturation
in March 2014 may increase chances of a distressed debt exchange
or restructuring. </p>
<p>Hawker Beechcraft''s small- and mid-sized business jets
compete against models from General Dynamics Corp. (GD)''s Gulfstream
Aerospace, Textron Inc. (TXT)''s Cessna Aircraft and Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B)''s
Learjet. </p>
<p>This is certainly the most crowded part of the business-
jet market, DeNicolo said. Hawker Beechcraft also makes
military training and light-attack aircraft and small planes
used for air ambulance and aerial survey needs. </p>
<h2>AIG Chairman </h2>
<p>Miller remains chairman at New York-based AIG, according to
the insurer, which received a 2008 federal bailout that swelled
to $182.3 billion. He became a director in 2009 before moving up
to chairman the next year. </p>
<p>The board has an active succession planning process and
will be assessing its plans in light of Mr. Miller''s
announcement, Mark Herr, an AIG spokesman, said in an e-mail
today. Benmosche in December said he would like to remain CEO
past 2012, longer than previously planned. </p>
<p>AIG has sought to assure investors there will be a smooth
CEO transition as the U.S. government winds down its investment.
Peter Hancock, who runs AIG''s global property-casualty business,
and life-insurance head Jay Wintrob are two internal front-
runners to be the next CEO, former General Counsel Ernest
Patrikis said last year. </p>
<h2>Delphi, Chrysler </h2>
<p>Miller dubbed himself The Turnaround Kid after a career
of helping hobbled companies survive. He helped oversee the
bankruptcy of auto-parts suppliers Delphi Corp. (DLPH) and Federal-
Mogul Corp. (FDML) and assisted in Chrysler Corp.''s return to profits
after taking $1.5 billion in government loans in 1980. Chrysler
repaid that borrowing seven years early. </p>
<p>His 2008 autobiography was called The Turnaround Kid:
What I Learned in Rescuing America''s Most Troubled Companies. </p>
<p>That background should reassure creditors that he''s not
new to the game in the event that Hawker Beechcraft opts to
file for Chapter 11 protection, said Dan Luria, director of
research for the Michigan Manufacturing Technology Center. </p>
<p>In a statement, Miller said he was honored to join
Hawker Beechcraft to help this company navigate through the
challenges of the current general aviation market. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, the fifth-biggest U.S.
bank''s private-equity arm, and Onex Corp. bought Hawker
Beechcraft in 2007 for about $3.3 billion, giving the bank and
Canada''s largest buyout firm equal stakes of 49 percent each. </p>

<p> Coca-Cola Co., the world''s largest
soft-drink maker, reported fourth-quarter profit that topped
analysts'' estimates as teas and juices boosted sales in Asia. </p>
<p>Profit excluding some items was 79 cents a share, Atlanta-
based Coca-Cola said today in a statement. That exceeded the 77-
cent average of 14 analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Net income in the quarter fell to $1.65 billion, or 72 cents a
share, from $5.77 billion, or $2.46, a year earlier, when the
company posted a gain from an acquisition. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent is expanding sales of
beverages in Asia with global marketing campaigns and products
such as its Minute Maid Pulpy juice drink. Fourth-quarter sales
volume climbed 5 percent in Japan and 10 percent in China. </p>
<p>Coke''s fourth-quarter results benefited from continued
strength from its international beverage portfolio, Ann Gurkin, an analyst for Davenport  Co. in Richmond, Virginia,
said today in a telephone interview. We also found the
continued strong performance by the Coca-Cola and Coke Zero
franchises as a standout for the North American segment. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola rose 0.8 percent to $68.55 at 4 p.m. in New York.
The shares climbed 6.4 percent last year, while PepsiCo Inc.
gained 1.6 percent. </p>
<p>The company also said it plans to reduce costs by $550
million to $650 million by 2015 and use the savings to invest in
its brands and mitigate higher commodities prices. Coca-Cola
said it exceeded the $500 million it sought to cut during the
four years that ended in the last quarter. </p>
<h2>Higher Prices </h2>
<p>Coca-Cola, which is facing higher costs for commodities
such as plastic and corn-based sweeteners, raised pricing to
retailers in North America by 1 percent for the year, less than
the 2 percent to 3 percent it forecast in October. </p>
<p>Kent said demand is strong for its flagship Coca-Cola soft
drink, with volume sales gaining 1 percent even as the company
raised retail pricing for carbonated beverages by 4 percent. </p>
<p>It''s a testament to the strength of our brands, Kent
said in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>Commodity costs this year may increase as much as $450
million from 2011, driven by juice ingredients and sweeteners,
Chief Financial Officer Gary Fayard said on a conference call
with analysts. Foreign-currency fluctuations may reduce
operating income in 2012 by a mid-single digit percentage,
Fayard said. </p>
<p>We have the right strategic plans in place to mitigate
the impacts of these incremental commodity costs and remain
confident in our ability to achieve our long-term growth
targets, Fayard said on the call. </p>
<h2>North American Sales </h2>
<p>Fourth-quarter sales volume in North America gained 1
percent. Volume sales of Coca-Cola''s flagship soft drink in the
region grew 1 percent in the quarter, while Coke Zero increased
by a high single-digit percentage, the company said. </p>
<p>Total sales in the quarter rose 5.2 percent to $11 billion,
matching the average estimate of 11 analysts. The Pacific region
unit, which includes China and Japan, boosted sales volume 5
percent. In the company''s Eurasia and Africa group, volume
climbed 4 percent while operating income jumped 16 percent.
Sales volume in India rose 20 percent. </p>
<p>In the year-earlier quarter, Coca-Cola recorded a $5
billion gain for the 33 percent stake in Coca-Cola Enterprises
Inc. it traded in the purchase of the bottler''s North American
operations. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. agreed to

<p>Dwight, which manages and advises about $42 billion in
assets, is scheduled to become part of Goldman Sachs Asset
Management in the second quarter, the New York-based bank said

<p>The purchase enables us to deliver more investment
solutions to help defined-contribution plan participants
preserve and grow their hard-earned retirement savings, said
Eric S. Lane and Timothy J. O''Neill, co-heads of Goldman Sachs''
investment management unit, in a statement today. </p>
<p>By expanding defined-contribution products, Goldman Sachs''
investment unit is seeking a bigger share in the U.S. retirement
market, where assets have surged 47 percent to $17 trillion
since 2000, according to data from the Investment Company
Institute in Washington. Employer-based defined-contribution
plans, which allow individuals to invest money toward
retirement, accounted for about $4.3 trillion of the total. </p>
<p>Stable value funds seek to preserve capital by investing in
bonds and are offered in about half of all defined-contribution
plans, according to the Stable Value Investment Association.
There are about $540 billion in assets in such funds, according
to the Washington-based organization. </p>
<p>The sale of Dwight will help free up capital to redeploy
into our global distribution and asset management franchise,
Peter Bain, the chief executive officer of Old Mutual Asset
Management, said in today''s statement. </p>

those who hadn''t joined the agreement as of yesterday''s deadline
for states to decide. More than 40 states signed on to the
accord, according to Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, who is
helping to lead talks with the banks. </p>
<p>Adding more numbers probably improves the political
dimension of the settlement from the standpoint of the attorneys
general, said Ken Scott, a Stanford University law professor.
If you can say there were only a handful of diehards that
didn''t sign on, that gives you some political protection. </p>
<p>All 50 states announced almost 16 months ago they were
investigating bank foreclosure practices following disclosures
that faulty documents were being used to seize homes. Officials
from a group of state attorneys general offices and federal
agencies, including the Justice Department, have since
negotiated terms of a proposed settlement with the five banks,
the nation''s largest mortgage servicers, that is said to be
worth as much as $25 billion. </p>
<p>Miller said federal and state officials continue to discuss
matters with the banks involved in the talks. </p>
<p>This enables us to move forward into the very final
stages of remaining work, Miller, a Democrat, said in a
statement yesterday. </p>
<p>Miller didn''t say which states have signed on and he
declined to comment further. </p>
<p>Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Wells Fargo
 Co. made a last-minute demand that New York drop claims filed
against them Feb. 3 as a condition of the settlement, a person
familiar with the matter said. </p>
<p>The push by the three banks raised a new obstacle in
getting Schneiderman''s support for the deal, said the person.
New York, along with California, Nevada and Delaware said late
yesterday they hadn''t signed on to the settlement. </p>
<p>New York sued Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo in
state court in Brooklyn, saying their use of a mortgage database
known as MERS led to improper foreclosures. Schneiderman said
the banks'' use of the Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems
database misled homeowners, undermined foreclosure proceedings
and created uncertainty about ownership interests in properties. </p>
<p>Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for Schneiderman, declined to
comment on the demand by the banks over the MERS lawsuit. </p>
<p>Mark Rodgers, a spokesman for New York-based Citigroup; Tom
Goyda of San Francisco-based Wells Fargo; Tom Kelly, a spokesman
at New York-based JPMorgan; and Gina Proia of Detroit-based Ally
Financial declined to comment on the settlement condition. </p>
<p>We''re interested in finding a path forward with a
comprehensive settlement that benefits homeowners and
communities, said Dan Frahm, a spokesman for Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America, declining to comment further. </p>

<h2>Verdicts/Settlements </h2>
<h2>JPMorgan Agrees to Pay $110 Million in Overdraft Fee Case </h2>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest U.S. bank by assets,
reached a preliminary agreement to pay $110 million to settle
litigation saying it gouged customers on overdraft fees for
checking accounts, court records show. </p>
<p>The settlement would resolve claims by customers including
Andrea Luquetta of Los Angeles, who sued over fees charged to
debit cards attached to her checking account. U.S. District
Judge James Lawrence King in Miami must approve any settlement.
King had earlier rejected arguments by various banks that
customers were legally bound to arbitrate the dispute. </p>
<p>We''re pleased to have reached an agreement in
principle, Patrick Linehan, a JPMorgan spokesman, said in an
e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>The litigation before King involves more than 30 banks sued
over their overdraft-fee policies. The customers say the banks
reorder debit-card transactions in their computers to maximize
overdraft fees. Bank of America Corp., the second-biggest U.S.
bank by assets, agreed last year to pay $410 million without
admitting liability to settle an overdraft lawsuit brought by
its customers. </p>
<p>In her lawsuit, filed in 2009, Luquetta claimed JPMorgan
engaged in unfair, deceptive and unconscionable assessment
and collection of overdraft fees. Her complaint also refers to
the practices of Washington Mutual Inc., which JPMorgan bought
in 2008. </p>
<p>Bruce Rogow, a lead attorney for the JPMorgan Chase
customers, wouldn''t comment on the accord. Another lead
attorney, Robert Gilbert, didn''t return a phone call or e-mail
seeking comment. </p>

<h2>Contorinis Must Pay $8.3 Million in SEC Lawsuit, Judge Rules </h2>
<p>Joseph Contorinis, an ex-Jefferies Paragon Fund money
manager, must pay $8.3 million in a U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission insider-trading suit, a judge ruled. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Richard J. Sullivan in New York granted
the SEC summary judgment, or a ruling before trial, in a Feb. 3
order, citing the facts proved at an earlier criminal trial. </p>
<p>Contorinis was accused of illegally trading on inside tips
about bids for Albertsons Inc. supplied by Nicos Stephanou, an
investment banker who was the government''s chief witness in the
trial. Contorinis was convicted of securities fraud and
conspiracy in a scheme that federal authorities said netted more
than $7 million in illegal profits. He is serving a six-year
prison term. </p>
<p>Sullivan, who also presided at the criminal trial, rejected
the defense argument that Contorinis shouldn''t have to disgorge
funds that he never received or enjoyed and that he
personally profited by a small percentage of the illegal
gains. </p>
<p>Defendant is fully capable for his crimes, from which he
profited substantially, Sullivan wrote in his order. </p>
<p>The jury''s verdict reflects defendant''s trades in ABS
occurred over a period of two months, revealing a high degree of
intent and a willingness to repeatedly exploit misappropriated
information, Sullivan wrote, referring to Albertsons by its
ticker symbol. </p>
<p>Stephanou, a longtime friend of the defendant employed as
an investment banker at UBS AG, testified he passed him
nonpublic information regarding efforts by Cerberus Capital
Management LP, to acquire Albertsons, which was then the second-
biggest U.S. grocer. </p>
<p>The SEC case is Securities and Exchange Commission v.
Stephanou, 1:09-cv-011042, and the criminal case is U.S. v.
Contorinis, 09-cr-01083, U.S. District Court, Southern District

<h2>Smith  Nephew Settles Bribe Cases With U.S. for $22 Million </h2>
<p>Smith  Nephew Plc, Europe''s biggest maker of artificial
hips and knees, agreed to pay $22.2 million to settle
allegations by the U.S. Justice Department and Securities and
Exchange Commission that it engaged in a scheme to pay bribes in
Greece. </p>
<p>Smith  Nephew admitted in filings yesterday in federal
court in Washington that two of its units were involved in a
scheme for more than a decade to make illicit payments to
doctors employed by government hospitals or agencies in Greece
in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. </p>
<p>The London-based company, which entered into a deferred
prosecution agreement with the U.S., agreed to pay a $16.8
million fine to settle the criminal allegations and another $5.4
million to settle a civil suit filed by the SEC. </p>
<p>Smith  Nephew''s subsidiaries chose a path of corruption
rather than fair and honest competition, Kara Novaco
Brockmeyer, chief of the SEC enforcement division''s FCPA unit,
said in a statement. The SEC will continue to hold companies
liable as we investigate the medical device industry for this
type of illegal behavior. </p>
<p>We have what I believe to be a world-class compliance
program, having enhanced it significantly since this
investigation began in 2007, Olivier Bohuon, Smith  Nephew''s
chief executive officer, said in a statement. These legacy
issues do not reflect Smith  Nephew today. </p>

<h2>Ex-AFG Chief Hand Gets 8 to 16 Years for Witness Murder Plot </h2>
<p>Ex-AFG Financial Group Inc. Chief Executive Officer Aaron
Hand, already imprisoned for his role in a fraudulent $100
million mortgage scheme, was sentenced to eight to 16 years in
prison after he pleaded guilty to plotting to kill a witness who
testified against him. </p>
<p>Hand was sentenced in New York State Supreme Court
yesterday by Justice Laura Ward, before whom he pleaded guilty
in January to one count of conspiracy to commit murder. Hand,
40, was ordered in 2010 to serve as long as 25 years in prison
and the new sentence will run consecutive with that, prosecutors
have said. </p>
<p>The defendant''s actions strike at the heart of the
justice system, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr.
said in a statement in January. Nothing is more important than
the safety of witnesses. </p>
<p>Hand pleaded not guilty when he was charged in October. His
lawyer at the time, Kevin Canfield, said his client was
entrapped by the police. </p>
<p>Entrapment is an extremely difficult affirmative
defense, Hand''s lawyer, Lee Ginsberg, said outside court
yesterday. This was a more appropriate way to resolve the
situation. </p>
<p>Hand was the mastermind of a mortgage scheme that defrauded
Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo  Co. and other banks,
according to Vance''s office, which said it won convictions
against all 27 people charged. </p>

Court (Manhattan). </p>

<h2>New Suits </h2>
<h2>Pfizer, Ranbaxy Sued Over Alleged Anti-Competitive Scheme </h2>
<p>Pfizer Inc. and Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. were sued in an
antitrust case filed in federal court in New York alleging the
drugmakers engaged in an anti-competitive scheme to delay a
generic version of Lipitor into the market. </p>
<p>The AFL-AGC Building Trades Welfare plan, a health and
welfare benefit plan based in Mobile, Alabama, claims that two
drugmakers engaged in a monopolization scheme after the Pfizer''s
original patent for the cholesterol-lowering drug expired on
March 24, 2010. </p>
<p>In the proposed class-action, or group, lawsuit, the
plaintiffs allege the drug companies agreed to delay the entry
of generic Lipitor for 20 months. As a result of an unlawful
agreement with generic-maker Ranbaxy, Pfizer cost purchasers to
pay more for Lipitor than they would have paid for the generic
version of the drug. </p>
<p>Defendants'' scheme was successful -- generic Lipitor did
not become available for sale until November 2011, the
plaintiffs said. As a result of defendants'' illegal acts,
plaintiffs and the indirect purchaser class were forced to pay
billions of dollars more for Lipitor than they would have absent
defendants'' anticompetitive scheme. </p>
<p>Both drugmakers were sued in a complaint making similar
allegations filed in federal court in San Francisco by 11
California pharmacies in November. In that case, the plaintiffs
alleged that they held back on a generic version of the
cholesterol-lowering drug in the U.S. and then fixed its price. </p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission reviewed the terms of the
2008 settlement, Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman said in a
telephone interview. Pfizer believes the suit has no merit. We
are confident that the Lipitor patent settlement with Ranbaxy is
appropriate, he said. </p>
<p>Chuck Caprariello, a spokesman for Ranbaxy, didn''t
immediately return a voice-mail message left at his office
seeking comment on the complaint. </p>

Inc. (PFE) 12-CV-931, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). </p>
<h2>Sloan-Kettering, Celgene Sued Over Cancer Research Deal </h2>
<p>The head of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center was
accused along with biotechnology company Celgene Corp. of using
research he helped develop at another cancer institute to start
his own company. </p>
<p>The Leonard and Madlyn Abramson Family Cancer Research
Institute at Philadelphia''s University of Pennsylvania sued Dr.
Craig Thompson in federal court in Manhattan for fraudulent
misrepresentation, asking a judge to decide on the ownership of
intellectual property rights to the research. The institute
seeks damages from Thompson of more than $1 billion, according
to the complaint. </p>
<p>Thompson studied cancer metabolism while he was scientific
director of the institute, which was created by a $100 million
donation from the Abramson family foundation to the university,
according to the complaint filed Dec. 13. Without telling the
institute, Thompson formed Agios Pharmaceuticals Inc. to exploit
the research and got funding from Summit, New Jersey-based
Celgene, the institute said. </p>
<p>At Sloan-Kettering, Thompson''s laboratory studies how cells
use nutrients and how that affects DNA and cell growth,
according to the hospital''s website. Cancer occurs when cells
divide and grow out of control. Agios is working to develop
drugs with the ability to starve cancer cells of the
nutrients they need to survive, according to the company''s
website. </p>
<p>The allegations in this lawsuit are unfounded and without
merit, Thompson said yesterday in a statement. It is
unfortunate that the Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute
has chosen to go down this path. </p>
<p>Kathy Lewis, a spokeswoman for Sloan-Kettering, and Jay
Mayresh, a lawyer for Celgene, declined to comment on the suit. </p>
<p>Agios was also sued. </p>
<p>While Agios does not comment on the specifics of pending
litigation, the claims asserted in this case are without
merit, a spokesman for Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Agios
said in a statement. There are no allegations of wrongdoing by
Agios. </p>
<p>Allan Arffa, an attorney for Thompson, didn''t return a
phone message. Jay Mayresh, a lawyer for Celgene, declined to
comment. </p>

<h2>Lawsuits/Pretrial </h2>
<h2>BofA Investor Suit Over Merrill Deal Granted Class Status </h2>
<p>A Bank of America Corp. investor lawsuit claiming the
company misled shareholders about the acquisition of Merrill
Lynch  Co. may proceed as a class action, a federal judge said. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel in Manhattan ruled
yesterday that the claims in the case may go forward on behalf
of all investors who held Bank of America common stock and call
options from Sept. 18, 2008, to Jan. 21, 2009. Castel also
certified a class of investors who held common stock on Oct. 10,
2008, and were entitled to vote on the Merrill acquisition. </p>
<p>Given the potential class size and the likelihood that
individual recovery for some class members may be relatively
modest, class certification is appropriate, Castel wrote. </p>
<p>The suit, filed in 2009, claims Bank of America failed to
disclose information about bonuses to Merrill employees and
about the firm''s financial losses in the fourth quarter of 2008.
The decision to grant class status allows investors to pool
resources and gives their lawyers more leverage to push for a
settlement with the bank. </p>
<p>Lawrence Grayson, a Bank of America spokesman, declined to
comment on the ruling. </p>
<p>The case is In re Bank of America Corp. (BAC) Securities,
Derivative and ERISA Litigation, 09-mdl-2058, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<h2>GE Capital Accused of Not Telling AerCap About Brazil Suit </h2>
<p>General Electric Co.''s financial services unit was sued by
units of AerCap Holdings NV (AER) for allegedly failing to tell the
aircraft-leasing company about a lawsuit in Brazil. </p>
<p>According to a complaint filed Feb. 3 in New York State
Supreme Court in Manhattan, a lawyer for General Electric
Capital Corp. told AerCap in February 2010 that the company was
liable for millions of dollars in a court case involving
Transbrasil SA, the bankrupt Brazilian airline. </p>
<p>The airline had sued GE and AerCap in February 2001 to void
promissory notes issued in 1999 in connection with the leases of
two engines and an aircraft, according to the complaint. GE lost
an appeal of a 2007 judgment entered against AerCap and other
defendants, and Transbrasil is asking Brazilian courts to
enforce the judgment, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>GE had concealed from AerCap that it was named as a
defendant in the lawsuit and had directed the defense of the
lawsuit -- with catastrophic results -- without AerCap''s
knowledge or consent since 2001, AerCap said in the complaint. </p>
<p>Transbrasil has said the appeals court decision entitles it
to about $223 million, including interest, from AerCap and other
defendants, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>General Electric hasn''t been served with the lawsuit and
doesn''t comment on pending litigation, Daniel Whitney, a
spokesman for GE Capital Aviation Services, said in an e-mail. </p>

<h2>Trials/Appeals </h2>
<h2>Oracle Seeks New Trial Against SAP After Verdict Dismissed </h2>
<p>Oracle Corp. has elected for a new trial against SAP AG for
alleged copyright infringement, rejecting a judge''s decision to
reduce a $1.3 billion jury verdict against SAP to $272 million,
according to a court filing. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton in Oakland,
California, threw out the $1.3 billion verdict in September,
calling it grossly excessive, and said SAP should get a new
trial if Oracle rejects her decision to reduce the amount to
$272 million. </p>
<p>Oracle''s objective is to obtain clarification of the law
and, if it is right about what the law is and what the evidence
supports in this case, to vindicate the verdict of the jury and
Oracle''s intellectual property rights as a copyright owner,
Oracle attorney Geoffrey Howard said in a filing yesterday in
federal court in Oakland. </p>
<p>In the trial, Oracle accused SAP''s TomorrowNow software-
maintenance unit of making hundreds of thousands of illegal
downloads and several thousand copies of Oracle''s software.
Oracle said SAP''s aim was to avoid paying licensing fees and to
steal customers. </p>
<p>Jim Dever, an SAP spokesman, didn''t return a voice=mail

<p>Ex-Dresdner CEO Jentzsch Says Promised Bonuses for Stability'' </p>
<p>Stefan Jentzsch, the former chief executive officer of
Dresdner Kleinwort''s investment bank, said he promised to set
aside 400 million euros ($523 million) for bonuses in 2008 to
retain workers and ensure the firm''s safety and stability. </p>
<p>He testified at a London trial yesterday where more than
100 former Dresdner bankers are suing Commerzbank AG over the
bonuses outlined by Jentzsch at a company meeting in 2008. They
say Commerzbank, which bought Dresdner in 2009, went back on his
pledge and are seeking individual payouts of as much as 2
million euros. </p>
<p>The objective in promising the payments was first and
foremost to ensure the safety and stability of the firm,
Jentzsch said in his first witness testimony at the trial.
That was what the FSA was concerned about. </p>
<p>The U.K. Financial Services Authority had put Dresdner on
its watch list in 2008 because it was worried key staff would
leave while the future of the investment-banking division was
being decided by then-owner Allianz SE. (ALV) Jentzsch said bonuses
should be given out based on an employee''s performance during
that specific year, and that it was cynical to decide a
bonus based on whether or not that department or person is of
use going forward. </p>
<p>Commerzbank CEO Martin Blessing testified last week,
defending the German lender''s decision to cut bonus awards at
Dresdner by 90 percent or more in 2009. He said losses caused by
the financial crisis justified the move, and that bankers should
by motivated by loyalty, not just money. </p>
<p>The bankers'' cases include: Mr. Fahmi Anar  Others v.
Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd., Commerzbank AG, High Court of Justice,
Queen''s Bench Division, HQ09X05230 and Richard Attrill  71

<h2>Fidelity''s Stairs Believed Chaoda Share Sale News Was Public </h2>
<p>Fidelity Management  Research Co.''s George Stairs believed
share placement information he was given by Chaoda Modern
Agriculture Holdings Ltd.''s chairman and chief financial officer
was public, a Hong Kong inquiry heard. </p>
<p>Chaoda management said nothing to Stairs to indicate he
would be precluded from trading shares of the Chinese vegetable
supplier, according to a letter from Fidelity''s lawyers
presented in evidence on the first day of a Market Misconduct
Tribunal hearing. </p>
<p>Stairs, then a portfolio manager at Fidelity Management,
traded Chaoda''s shares after being told on a conference call by
Kwok Ho, the company''s chairman and Andy Chan, its chief
financial officer, about a June 2009 share placement before the
information was public, Hong Kong''s government alleges. </p>
<p>Stairs netted proceeds of HK$1.98 million ($255,299) for
his funds by selling shares prior to the placement and then
buying more in the stock sale at a lower price, according to a
government notice. The call was one of six arranged by Merrill
Lynch (Asia Pacific) Ltd. between Chaoda management and
institutional investors. </p>
<p>Boston-based Fidelity Investments conducted a thorough
internal review of the matter in 2009 and believes that Stairs
didn''t violate any laws or regulations, according to spokesman
Vincent Loporchio. We have a zero-tolerance policy with regard
to the misuse of material non-public information, Loporchio
wrote in an e-mail before the hearing. </p>
<p>Mark Tsang, a Hong Kong-based spokesman for Bank of
America, which bought Merrill Lynch in 2009, declined to comment
on the inquiry and whether the investors were asked if they were
willing to receive material non-public information on condition
of refraining to trade on such information, also known as wall
crossing. </p>
<p>Kwok, who has denied the allegations, and Stairs, now in a
research position at Fidelity, declined to comment yesterday on
the proceedings. </p>

<h2>Stanford Claimed $5.1 Billion, Had $173 Million Cash, CFO Said </h2>
<p>R. Allen Stanford told his top brokers in late 2008 that
his Antiguan bank was sitting on $5.1 billion more cash than
it needed, while his treasury manager was privately e-mailing
him that there was just $173.6 million cash on hand, Stanford''s
former finance chief testified. </p>
<p>At the present burn rate of withdrawals we had 35 days to
45 days of cash left, James M. Davis, the former Stanford
Financial Group Co. chief financial officer, told jurors at
Stanford''s criminal trial in federal court in Houston. </p>
<p>Davis, who is testifying under a plea deal, said customers
spooked by the global financial meltdown accelerated redemptions
of certificates of deposit from Antigua-based Stanford
International Bank Ltd. in the second half of 2008. By December
of that year, the bank''s cash balance had dropped to $88.2
million, according to an e-mail shown to jurors. </p>
<p>Stanford, who was monitoring the bank''s falling cash
balance on pretty much a daily basis at that point, Davis
said, decided to shore up investor confidence and slow the run
on the bank by making a $541 million capital infusion from his
personal assets. </p>
<p>He told me just to make a paper entry into the accounting
records that it had been made, Davis told U.S. District Judge
David Hittner, who is presiding over Stanford''s trial. </p>
<p>How would that pay off people at the bank if it was just
a paper entry? Hittner asked Davis. It was just to stop the
withdrawals and get more CD purchases coming in? </p>
<p>Davis replied that was the plan. </p>
<p>Stanford, 61, denies all wrongdoing in connection with 14
criminal charges of mail fraud, wire fraud and obstructing a
Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. He faces as
long as 20 years in prison if convicted of the most serious
charges, and has been imprisoned as a flight risk since his
indictment in June 2009. </p>

<h2>Court News </h2>
<h2>Health-Care Case Tests Supreme Court''s Ban on Live Broadcasts </h2>
<p>The historic U.S. Supreme Court battle over President
Barack Obama''s signature health-care legislation -- with 5 1/2
hours of arguments planned over three days on a matter that
affects every American and may influence the 2012 elections --
will test the justices'' refusal to allow live broadcasts of
their proceedings. </p>
<p>Lawmakers and media organizations are pressing for live
television coverage, or failing that, live audio, in a case that
will determine whether the government can force people to obtain
insurance. The length of the arguments has few precedents in
modern court history, and the case will be the court''s highest
profile since the battle between George W. Bush and Al Gore in
the 2000 presidential election. </p>
<p>This is the focusing event and this puts more pressure on
the court just because of the high level of interest, said
Lawrence Baum, a political science professor at Ohio State
University in Columbus. </p>
<p>The court has given no indication it will relent on its ban
of live broadcasts, and court observers said it''s unlikely. Even
as Americans have come to expect live coverage of news events,
the justices have made their marble courtroom a technology-free
zone, barring spectators from using recording devices,
telephones and cameras. The court releases its own audio
recordings at the end of the week and has never allowed video,
even on a delayed basis. </p>
<p>Justices are considering requests from a dozen lawmakers
and more than 30 media organizations, including Bloomberg News,
seeking live coverage. They say that there''s a strong national
interest in watching live arguments over an issue that touches
everyone and affects the economy and presidential election. </p>
<p>Justices will hear arguments in the health-care case --
which pits the Obama administration against 26 states -- from
March 26 to March 28, an unusual series. Justices generally hear
arguments for a single hour in each case. </p>
<p>The court will consider whether Congress overstepped its
authority by requiring Americans to acquire health insurance or
pay a penalty. Republican presidential candidates repeatedly
have criticized the measure and demanded its repeal. However the
court rules during the presidential contest under way, it will
become a central issue of the 2012 campaign. </p>

Inc. in New York, said in a phone interview. He is a former
chief executive officer of Burbank, California-based UNX LLC, a
technology company that has an execution-management system.
You have to pay commissions to multiple brokers to get
services, he said. Clients need access to many brokers on
one system. </p>
<h2>Currencies, Rates </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs acquired the software that formed the basis
for REDI Technologies when it purchased New York Stock Exchange
specialist Spear, Leeds  Kellogg LP in 2000 and has expanded it
to handle trades in asset classes such as currencies and
interest rates. Goldman Sachs expects the independent business
to meet client demand for execution management systems that give
them easier access to multiple brokers and aren''t seen as
single-dealer platforms, one of the people said. </p>
<p>Tabb Group LLC, a New York-based research firm, said in a
June report that single-dealer execution-management systems,
which once functioned for clients as a direct highway of order
flow and a portal to services, have become less relevant to
the brokers that sponsored them. Their return on investment is
questionable, the report said. </p>
<p>The REDI platform is used by Goldman Sachs''s hedge fund
clients, asset managers and brokers that employ the firm''s
electronic-trading services. While orders can be sent to some
brokers through the REDI system, it''s used primarily to ship
orders to Goldman Sachs, one of the people said. </p>
<p>Rishi Nangalia, an executive in the Goldman Sachs
Electronic Trading unit, will have a senior role in the
business, according to one of the people. </p>
<h2>Barclays, ConvergEx </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s plans come about a year after London-based
Barclays Plc sold the RealTick trading platform, which lets
customers access services from multiple brokers, to New York-
based ConvergEx Inc. Barclays said in December 2010 that it
planned to use the system within its investment banking unit and
offer the platform to customers. The bank got RealTick when it
acquired part of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008. </p>
<p>Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase  Co., Knight Capital Group
Inc. and other securities firms bought execution-management
systems starting in the mid-2000s to give mutual funds and other
clients access to exchanges and algorithms, or trading
strategies that allow them to process larger orders in small
pieces over a preset period, along with other transaction
services. Some platforms were open to the algorithms of multiple
brokers or technology providers while others focused on those
from a single firm. </p>
<h2>ITG, Instinet </h2>
<p>Single-broker EMSs offer branding, constant presence and
a single portal to services, Tabb''s report said. Routing to
other brokers may also be an option, but as a reluctant service
rather than an advertised benefit. </p>
<p>Investment Technology Group Inc. and Instinet Inc., a
subsidiary of Tokyo-based Nomura Holdings Inc., offer execution
platforms to customers. Both firms are execution-only brokers
that don''t trade with their own money. Bloomberg LP, the parent
of Bloomberg News, offers similar systems. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs and brokers providing mainly execution
services had the most success in finding users among asset
managers that considered them one of their top five brokers, the
Tabb report said. Trading platforms from Morgan Stanley,
JPMorgan and Bank of America Corp. are less utilized, Tabb said. </p>
<p>Our hope is to deliver a product to our clients that''s
open, that delivers them products and services from multiple
brokers, assets and markets across the globe, Nangalia, who
runs REDI Technologies, said in an undated online video about
the business. We are not limited to the services that are
offered by one firm nor by the size of a small technology
vendor. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co., owner of the ABC

Inc. to create an English-language 24-hour cable-news channel,
according to two people with knowledge of the situation. </p>
<p>Disney, based in Burbank, California, would oversee
advertising sales and distribution for the venture, said the
people, who sought anonymity because an agreement hasn''t been
reached. The channel would draw newsgathering resources from ABC
News and Univision, the largest U.S. Spanish-language
broadcaster, they said. </p>
<p>The discussions have been under way for at least six months
and are ongoing, said the people. The channel would be based in
Miami and start service before the November presidential
election, they said. </p>
<p>A venture would provide Disney, which reports first-quarter
results today after markets close, with a cable-news presence,
and advance Univision Chief Executive Officer Randy Falco''s goal
of building new channels. Falco is interested in starting
English-language service in sports and news, he told the Wall

<p>Closely held Univision, based in New York, is starting a
Spanish-language telenovela network this month on Dish Network
Corp.''s satellite-TV system. Spanish-language sports and news
channels will follow by midyear, according to Monica Talan, a

<p>Disney added 1.2 percent to $40.46 yesterday in New York
and has gained 7.9 percent this year. </p>

<p>Visa Inc. (V), the world''s biggest
payments network, said fiscal first-quarter profit climbed 16
percent as consumers increased use of credit and debit cards. </p>
<p>Net income for the three months ended Dec. 31 rose to $1.03
billion, or $1.49 a share, from $884 million, or $1.23, a year
earlier, the San Francisco-based company said today in a
statement. The average estimate of 26 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for earnings per share of $1.45. Visa authorized a
new $500 million share repurchase program. </p>
<p>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Joseph W. Saunders,
66, is positioning Visa for its next phase of growth after U.S.
regulators capped so-called swipe fees, or interchange, that the
company charges merchants for debit-card purchases. Visa, which
derived about 56 percent of revenue from the U.S. in fiscal
2011, has said it intends to generate more than half from
markets abroad by 2015. </p>
<p>We remain intensely focused on further growing our
international business, Saunders said in the statement. At
the same time, we are moving forward on our innovation
strategy. </p>
<p>Visa advanced 3.2 percent to $111.78 at 6:36 p.m. in
extended trading in New York after gaining 45 percent in the
past year, the second-best performance in the 71-company
Standard  Poor''s 500 Information Technology Index (S5INFT) after
Purchase, New York-based MasterCard Inc. (MA), the No. 2 network,
which climbed 58 percent. Shares of both companies closed at
all-time highs today. </p>
<h2>Worldwide Spending </h2>
<p>Operating revenue was $2.55 billion, beating the average
estimate of $2.47 billion by analysts in the Bloomberg survey.
Worldwide spending on Visa credit and debit cards, adjusted for
currency fluctuations, climbed 11 percent to $994 billion in the
first quarter from a year earlier, the company said. </p>
<p>Cross-border volume, a measure of spending by consumers
outside their home countries, surged 13 percent. Processed
transactions worldwide rose 8 percent to 13.6 billion as
consumers continued to shift from cash and checks to electronic
payments. </p>
<p>There are signs of modest expansion of worldwide gross
domestic product for the rest of the fiscal year, with
emerging markets continuing to grow at rates faster than the
global average, Saunders said in a conference call with
analysts after results were announced. That being said, we are
closely watching economic conditions that could impact our
business, including continued volatility in Europe. </p>
<h2>2012 Outlook </h2>
<p>Visa updated its 2012 outlook, forecasting net revenue
growth in the low teens and earnings-per-share growth in the
high teens. The company previously expected high single to
low double-digit revenue growth and EPS growth in the mid to
high teens, according to its fourth-quarter statement. </p>
<p>In December, Visa announced a plan to help develop Rwanda''s
payments system and connect the African nation''s 11 million
citizens to the global economy. The company also has rolled out
prepaid accounts linked to mobile phones across Africa and the
Middle East. </p>
<p>MasterCard said Feb. 2 that fourth-quarter profit climbed
24 percent to $514 million. The company reported 2011 profit of
$1.91 billion. </p>
<p>MasterCard took a $495 million charge representing its
portion of a potential settlement to price-fixing litigation
that challenges credit-card interchange fees, which generate
about $40 billion a year for U.S. banks. Merchants sued Visa,
MasterCard and banks including JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) in 2005,
claiming that the companies stifled competition by banning
merchants from steering customers to cheaper forms of payment. </p>
<h2>Interchange Litigation </h2>
<p>An accord may cost $4 billion, and last February, the
defendants agreed that Visa would be responsible for two-thirds
of any settlement and MasterCard would pay about one-eighth. </p>
<p>In December, Visa said it would deposit $1.57 billion into
its litigation escrow account to prepare for any settlement. It
now has $4.3 billion in the account, Saunders said. </p>
<p>Visa is unwilling to agree to any significant or long-
term credit interchange rate reductions or any settlement
agreement that doesn''t provide a full resolution to that and
other key issues, Saunders said during the conference call. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world''s largest
software maker, will unveil the first broadly available test
version of the Windows 8 operating system on Feb. 29 in
Barcelona, Spain, at a mobile industry show. </p>
<p>The Redmond, Washington-based company sent invitations via
e-mail for an event to show the test product, called the Windows
8 Consumer Preview. Microsoft is relying on the newest version
of Windows to make headway in the tablet-computer market. The
two-hour session is scheduled to take place during the Mobile
World Congress trade show. </p>
<p>Revenue from Windows software, which runs most of the
world''s personal computers, has missed analysts'' estimates in
four of the past five quarters, in part because some consumers
are defecting from laptops with Windows to tablets like Apple
Inc.''s iPad. Microsoft probably won''t be able to significantly
change that trend until Windows 8 goes on sale, Chief Financial
Officer Peter Klein said in an interview last month. </p>
<p>The company has declined to say when Windows 8 will be
officially released. Microsoft shares rose 1 percent to $30.66
at the close in New York. The stock has increased 18 percent
this year. </p>

<p>General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP), the
second-biggest U.S. shopping-mall owner, said funds from
operations excluding some items rose in the fourth quarter as
tenant demand for space in top-tier retail centers increased. </p>
<p>The company''s so-called core FFO climbed to $279.8 million,
or 29 cents a share, from $230.1 million, or 23 cents, a year
earlier, the Chicago-based company said today in a statement.
Analysts expected core FFO, which excludes items such as
discontinued operations and costs related to debt retirement, of
27 cents a share, the average of 10 estimates in a Bloomberg
survey. FFO is a measure of a property owner''s ability to
generate cash. </p>
<p>General Growth plans to redevelop, expand and refurbish
shopping centers to boost growth. The real estate investment
trust last month completed its spinoff of 30 malls that have
lower tenant sales as Rouse Properties Inc. (RSE), allowing General
Growth to focus on its better-performing centers. </p>
<p>The spinoff of Rouse Properties was the big decision of
2011, Cedrik Lachance, a managing director at Green Street
Advisors Inc. in Newport Beach, California, said in a telephone
interview before earnings were announced. Retailers do seek to
be in higher-end properties. </p>
<h2>Mall Occupancies </h2>
<p>General Growth said occupancies at its regional malls rose
to 94.6 percent at the end of December and the initial rent on
leases completed in 2011 increased 8.3 percent to $65.67 a
square foot. Comparable sales by its tenants gained 7.9 percent
to $505 a square foot. </p>
<p>The company released its results after the close of regular
U.S. trading. General Growth rose 0.5 percent to $16.67 in New
York trading. </p>
<p>Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG), the only U.S. mall owner larger
than General Growth, on Feb. 3 reported fourth-quarter results
that were higher than analysts'' estimates and increased its
dividend 5.6 percent. </p>

<p>Lucas van Praag, who became one of
the public faces of the U.S. financial industry as Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)''s global head of corporate communications, is leaving
the firm after 12 years. </p>
<p>Van Praag, a 62-year-old British citizen, will retire at
the end of March and continue to provide strategic advice as a
consultant to the company, according to an internal memo signed
by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and President Gary D. Cohn. The memo''s contents were confirmed by Michael DuVally,
a spokesman. Van Praag was promoted to partner, the highest rank
in the New York-based company, in 2006. </p>
<p>Lucas has played a critical role in helping the firm
navigate through one of the most difficult and testing
environments the firm has faced, particularly during the
financial crisis and its aftermath, Blankfein and Cohn said in
the memo. His strategic counsel and deep understanding of
complex issues defined his career at the firm as did his warmth,
natural inclusiveness and determination in the face of
relentless demands. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, has
been in talks with Richard Jake Siewert Jr., 48, a former
counselor to U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, to
manage the bank''s communications department, three people
familiar with the situation said last week. Siewert worked as a
press secretary for President Bill Clinton and managed corporate
development and public strategy at Alcoa Inc. (AA) before joining
Treasury in 2009. </p>
<h2>Other Partners Leave </h2>
<p>Van Praag follows about 50 partners who left Goldman Sachs
in the last year amid sagging profits and pay. Six members of
the firm''s management committee, including trading co-heads
David B. Heller and Edward K. Eisler, also left in the last 12
months. The company eliminated 2,400 jobs last year as it
reduced compensation 21 percent. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the most profitable securities firm in Wall
Street history before converting to a bank in 2008, has been
criticized by regulators and politicians for activities leading
to 2008''s financial crisis. Blankfein, 57, settled a Securities
and Exchange Commission lawsuit against the firm in 2010,
reviewed the company''s business standards and rolled out an
advertising campaign. </p>
<p>Van Praag became known for his disparaging rebuttals to
negative stories, favoring phrases like nonsense and
extraordinarily ill-informed. Goldman Sachs partners are
typically the firm''s highest compensated employees. Van Praag
paid $7.85 million in August 2008 for a townhouse on New York''s
Upper West Side, the Real Deal reported at the time, citing
public records. </p>

<p>Rajat Gupta, the ex-Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) director accused of giving inside information to fund
manager Raj Rajaratnam about that company and Procter  Gamble
Co., may face additional allegations he passed tips, prosecutors
said. </p>
<p>Federal prosecutors, at Gupta''s arraignment on revised
charges yesterday, also told U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff of a
second insider at Goldman Sachs who provided Rajaratnam with
information. </p>
<p>Prosecutors disclosed in a Feb. 3 letter certain witness
statements related to an insider at Goldman Sachs, a company
that provided information to Mr. Rajaratnam, that did not relate
to Goldman and or Procter  Gamble, Rakoff said during the
hearing as he read the Feb. 3 letter aloud. Gupta was a director
at Procter  Gamble. </p>
<p>Gupta''s lawyer, Gary Naftalis, had previously asked the
government to share any evidence that Rajaratnam had an inside
source at Goldman Sachs other than his client. The defense
lawyer has said the evidence may be used to show that the other
source is the culprit, not Gupta. Rakoff has also pressed
prosecutors to identify the purported source, whom he called
Mr. X. </p>
<p>Gupta, 63, pleaded not guilty yesterday to a revised
indictment filed last week. The latest charges broaden the
prosecutors'' description of the insider-trading scheme, saying
it began in March 2007, not in 2008, as the U.S. alleged when
Gupta was first charged in October. </p>
<p>Naftalis said that with the new allegations, they need more
time to prepare for trial. Rakoff agreed to postpone until May
21 from its scheduled start date of April 9. </p>
<p>What the government is doing here now is wildly expanding
what everybody in the world believed the case to be about,
Naftalis said, adding later, I really think it''s quite unfair.
They can investigate my client til the cows come home. </p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Reed Brodsky told the judge the
government may file yet another superseding indictment adding
new allegations that Gupta passed tips. </p>
<p>The judge told lawyers that with six additional weeks to
get ready for trial, no further delays will be allowed,
barring an act of God. </p>
<p>My goal is to get this show on the road in a way that''s
fair to all concerned, he said. </p>
<p>Prosecutors said that even if the judge doesn''t allow them
to further revise the indictment, they may still seek to
introduce evidence at Gupta''s trial of other acts of alleged
wrongdoing. </p>
<p>Naftalis declined to comment on yesterday''s hearing after
court. </p>
<p>Gupta, who denies wrongdoing, faces as long as 20 years in
prison if convicted of any of the securities fraud charges and
as long as five years if convicted of conspiracy, U.S. Attorney
Preet Bharara in Manhattan said. He also faces a fine of as much
as $5 million, prosecutors said. </p>
<p>Rajaratnam, who was convicted by a jury last year of
insider-trading charges, is serving an 11-year prison term. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Gupta, 11-cr-00907, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<h2>Four Accused of Running Insiders'' Criminal Club'' Indicted </h2>
<p>Four men arrested last month for allegedly participating in
a criminal club of inside traders that reaped almost $62
million from Dell Inc. shares were indicted by a federal grand
jury in Manhattan. </p>
<p>One trade earned a $53 million illegal windfall for Level
Global Investors LP co-founder Anthony Chiasson and his fund,
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara alleged. The ring, which
involved five hedge funds and investment firms, is the largest
identified by the U.S. to date tied to a single stock, federal
authorities said. </p>
<p>Chiasson; Todd Newman, a portfolio manager formerly at
Diamondback Capital Management LLC; Jon Horvath, a hedge fund
analyst in New York; and Danny Kuo, a fund manager for Whittier
Trust Co. in South Pasadena, California, were all named
yesterday in an indictment filed in federal court in New York.
They were charged in total with one count of conspiracy to
commit securities fraud and nine counts of securities fraud. </p>
<p>After a federal grand jury returned the indictment, the
case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan. </p>
<p>Illegal profits earned from the scheme were almost of the
same magnitude of fraud we proved in the Galleon Group insider
trading scheme, Bharara said. </p>
<p>A five-year insider-trading probe by Bharara''s office and
the Federal Bureau of Investigation in New York called Perfect
Hedge has resulted in charges against 63 people, said Janice
Fedarcyk, head of the FBI''s New York office. </p>
<p>More than 50 have pleaded guilty or been convicted after
trial since 2009, including Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj
Rajaratnam, who is serving an 11-year prison sentence. </p>
<p>Three men who were charged in the scheme to illegally trade
in Dell stock have pleaded guilty and are cooperating with the
U.S. -- Jesse Tortora of Diamondback; Spyridon Sam
Adondakis, a Level Global analyst; and Sandeep Goyal, a former
Dell employee, according to Bharara and court records. </p>
<p>The criminal case is U.S. v. Newman, 12-cr-121, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The
civil case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Adondakis,
12-409, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>
<h2>BNP Paribas Wins Dismissal of Unauthorized Trades Lawsuit </h2>
<p>BNP Paribas SA (BNP)''s wealth management unit won dismissal of a
lawsuit filed by Nitine Jantilal, a former client who claimed
the bank made unauthorized trades leading to a shortfall in his
account. </p>
<p>Jantilal sued the bank in 2009 over allegations that a
S$1.1 million ($883,000) reduction in his account was due to the
bank''s breaches. The Indian national had made two of his
relatives co-signatories of his account and claimed he was
unaware of trades based on instructions from them, Singapore
High Court Judge Choo Han Teck said in a ruling yesterday. </p>
<p>Jantilal assumed the risk of making his relatives
authorized signatories. He cannot now say that he did not
authorize them, Judge Choo said. BNP Paribas executed the
specific asset transactions and swap transactions with the
proper authority. </p>
<p>The decline in asset value in Jantilal''s account was due to
trades made by his authorized signatories and market
fluctuations, according to the ruling. </p>
<p>K. Muralidharan Pillai represented the bank. </p>
<p>The case is Nitine Jantilal v. BNP Paribas Wealth
Management S1048/2009 in the Singapore High Court. </p>
<h2>States With Highest Foreclosure Rates Among Bank Deal Holdouts </h2>
<p>California, New York, Nevada, Florida and Massachusetts are
among the states that haven''t signed off on a settlement with
banks over foreclosure abuses, according to state officials and
two people familiar with the talks. </p>
<p>The holdouts include some with the highest rates of
foreclosures. More than 6 percent of Nevada housing units had at
least one foreclosure filing in 2011, the nation''s highest rate,
according to RealtyTrac. California was third-highest with more
than 3 percent, said the firm, which tracks foreclosures. </p>
<p>California Attorney General Kamala Harris and New York
Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who have been among the most
outspoken in pushing for changes to the accord, were among those
who hadn''t joined as of a Feb. 6 deadline. More than 40 states
signed on, said Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, who is helping
to lead talks with the banks. </p>
<p>Adding more numbers probably improves the political
dimension of the settlement from the standpoint of the attorneys
general, said Ken Scott, a Stanford University law professor.
If you can say there were only a handful of diehards that
didn''t sign on, that gives you some political protection. </p>
<p>All 50 states announced almost 16 months ago they were
investigating bank foreclosure practices following disclosures
that faulty documents were being used to seize homes. Officials
from states and federal agencies, including the Justice
Department, have since negotiated terms of a proposed settlement
with five banks that is said to be worth as much as $25 billion. </p>
<p>Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley and Florida
Attorney General Pam Bondi hadn''t joined as of yesterday, said
the two people, who declined to be identified because the matter
isn''t public. Delaware and Nevada also hadn''t agreed to the
settlement as of Feb. 6, according to their offices. </p>
<p>Miller said federal and state officials continue to discuss
the proposed deal and its terms with the banks. </p>
<p>Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Wells Fargo
 Co. (WFC) made a last-minute demand that New York drop claims filed
against them Feb. 3 as a condition of the settlement, a person
familiar with that case said. The push by the three banks raised
an obstacle in getting Schneiderman''s support for the deal, said
the person. </p>
<p>New York sued Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo in
state court in Brooklyn, saying their use of a mortgage database
known as MERS led to improper foreclosures. </p>
<p>Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for Schneiderman, declined to
comment on the demand by the banks over the MERS lawsuit.
Schneiderman, who was scheduled to make remarks on the
settlement talks yesterday, postponed the conference call
indefinitely, according to a statement. </p>
<p>Mark Rodgers, a spokesman for New York-based Citigroup; Tom
Goyda of San Francisco-based Wells Fargo; Tom Kelly, a spokesman
at New York-based JPMorgan; and Gina Proia of Detroit-based Ally
Financial declined to comment on the proposed settlement terms. </p>
<p>We''re interested in finding a path forward with a
comprehensive settlement that benefits homeowners and
communities, said Dan Frahm, a spokesman for Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America, declining to comment further. </p>

<h2>News Corp.''s Times Mislead U.K. Court About Computer Hacking </h2>
<p>News Corp. (NWSA)''s Times newspaper in London misled a court and
lawyers for a police officer who suspected his e-mail account
had been hacked by a reporter, editor James Harding told a media
inquiry. </p>
<p>In the last couple of weeks, I''ve learned a great deal
more about what happened in this incident, Harding told the
inquiry that was set up in response to the phone-hacking scandal
at News Corp.''s now defunct News of the World. I sorely regret
the intrusion. </p>
<p>Reporter Patrick Foster hacked into officer Richard
Horton''s e-mail in May 2009 to expose him as the writer of an
unauthorized Nightjack blog about police work. Lawyers for
Horton, to prevent the story from being published, raised the
possibility that the e-mail had been illegally accessed. </p>
<p>Foster told his editor and the newsroom''s lawyer who
advised him to continue to pursue the story through legitimate
means and told Horton''s counsel that his identity was revealed
through deduction, Harding said. </p>
<p>The Metropolitan Police Service is investigating the Times
over e-mail hacking, Labour party lawmaker Tom Watson said in an
e-mail last week. The paper is the third News Corp. title in
London to come under suspicion in related probes of phone
hacking, computer hacking and bribes to police officers. The
scandal erupted in July after revelations that the News of the
World accessed messages on a murdered schoolgirl''s mobile phone. </p>

<h2>UBS Says Swiss Regulator Granted Immunity in Libor Investigation </h2>
<p>UBS AG (UBSN) said it was given immunity from a second antitrust
regulator as part of an investigation into whether the London
Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, was manipulated. </p>
<p>The bank has conditional immunity from the Swiss
Competition Commission regarding submissions for Yen Libor,
Euroyen Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate, or Tibor, and Swiss franc
Libor rates, the bank said in a regulatory filing yesterday. UBS
was granted similar immunity by the U.S. Department of Justice
in regards to Yen Libor and Euroyen Tibor because it is
cooperating with the probe, the Zurich-based bank said last
year. </p>
<p>UBS won''t be prosecuted, fined, or face other sanctions
from the Swiss regulator if it continues to cooperate, it said.
The regulator said last week that it was investigating 12 banks,
including UBS and Credit Suisse Group AG, over how the benchmark
for about $350 trillion of financial products is set. </p>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Justice Department,
Japan''s Financial Supervisory Agency and the U.K. Financial
Services Authority are investigating whether there were attempts
to manipulate Libor rates. European Union antitrust regulators
are also examining Libor rates. </p>

<h2>Google Removes Search, YouTube Content on Indian Court Order </h2>
<p>Google Inc. (GOOG) removed content from its India domains that was
deemed objectionable by a New Delhi district court after a civil
lawsuit against the owner of the world''s largest search engine. </p>
<p>The material was blocked from India search results,
YouTube, Blogger and the social-networking site Orkut, said
Gaurav Bhaskar, a spokesman for Google India. The content was
deleted from domains .in and .co.in, while remaining accessible
from other countries, Bhaskar said yesterday. Google can''t take
down content that appears on websites owned by other companies
and individuals, he said. </p>
<p>India is stepping up scrutiny of Internet postings and
mobile communications as it tries to eliminate provocative
comments and curb discord between religious groups. The Hindu-
majority South Asian country is home to more than 138 million
Muslims, comprising about 13 percent of the world''s second-
largest population. </p>
<p>This step is in accordance with Google''s long-standing
policy of responding to court orders, the company said in an
e-mailed statement yesterday. </p>
<p>The statement didn''t provide details about the lawsuit or
the content that was removed, and Bhaskar didn''t elaborate. </p>
<p>The order follows a civil complaint filed by Mufti Aijaz
Arshad Quasmi, an Indian activist who seeks the removal of
videos and images that could be seen as offensive to Muslims,
his lawyer Santosh Pandey said yesterday. </p>

<h2>Raytheon Executive Fined in $1 Billion FAA Contract Lawsuit </h2>
<p>A Raytheon Co. (RTN) executive was fined by a Washington court
for failing to give opponents in a lawsuit a reprimand letter
stemming from an affair with a subordinate while both worked at
the Federal Aviation Administration. </p>
<p>Charles E. Keegan, leader of Raytheon''s Civil Aviation
Solutions division, violated a court order to turn over to
Washington Consulting Group Inc. the document showing he had an
improper romantic relationship with the woman, Judge A. Franklin
Burgess Jr. of the District of Columbia Superior Court ruled
Feb. 7. </p>
<p>For the past two years, Washington Consulting Group, or
WCG, has argued that the relationship began at the FAA, and
continued after Keegan left for Raytheon and Maureen Knopes, now
Keegan''s wife, became responsible for a contracting program to
train air traffic controllers. WCG held the contract for more
than 20 years until Raytheon won it in 2008. </p>
<p>The Bethesda, Maryland-based company is seeking $1 billion
in damages from Raytheon and Keegan, claiming the relationship
contaminated the bidding process on the 10-year contract. Keegan
and his wife, now Knopes-Keegan, conspired with others to
reconfigure the FAA''s contracting program and stole WCG''s trade
secrets to ensure Raytheon would take the business, the lawsuit
claims. </p>
<p>Though it is faced with conflicting evidence as to
whether Keegan''s failure to produce the reprimand letter was
inadvertent or intentional, the court reaches the same
conclusion in either case, the judge said, ordering Keegan to
pay a portion of legal fees to opposing counsel. </p>
<p>The couple''s romance was investigated by the Transportation
Department''s inspector general. In 2004, a top FAA official
reprimanded Keegan in a letter for having an inappropriate
relationship that created a perception of favoritism and
the appearance of giving preferential treatment to Knopes-
Keegan, according to the judge''s ruling. </p>
<p>The letter wasn''t disclosed to WCG until Keegan was being
interviewed in the case in December. Keegan said in court
filings that the document was found in a box in his basement
that contained work papers along with a weather dial and a
runner''s bib. </p>
<p>These rulings are unrelated to the merits of the case,
Jon Kasle, a spokesman for Waltham, Massachusetts-based
Raytheon, said in an e-mail. Raytheon continues to maintain
that WCG''s suit is without merit, he said, adding that the
company is reviewing the rulings and will defend itself and
Keegan. </p>
<p>Steven Thomas, a lawyer for WCG, said in an e-mail the
ruling means Raytheon now must face public scrutiny of its
misconduct. </p>
<p>The case is Washington Consulting Group Inc. v. Raytheon
Technical Services Co. LLC, 10-00296, Superior Court of the
District of Columbia (Washington). </p>

<h2>Trials/Appeals </h2>
<h2>Hong Kong Regulator Says It Should Be Able to Redress Investors </h2>
<p>Hong Kong''s securities regulator, whose attempt to ban New
York-based hedge fund Tiger Asia Management LLC last year from
trading was blocked by a court, said it should have the right to
redress investors. </p>
<p>If private individuals can seek civil remedies, why does
the SFC have to wait? Benjamin Yu, a lawyer representing the
Securities and Futures Commission, told Hong Kong''s Court of
Appeal yesterday. </p>
<p>The regulator is trying to overturn a court ruling that it
lacks the power to unwind Tiger Asia''s transactions in the
market and ban the hedge fund and employees from trading in Hong
Kong before proving insider trading allegations in a tribunal or
criminal court. </p>
<p>The SFC alleges the hedge fund traded on inside information
from bankers arranging placements of China Construction Bank
Corp. (939) and Bank of China Ltd. shares in 2008 and 2009, pocketing
HK$38.5 million ($4.9 million). Tiger Asia, which has no
employees and physical presence in Hong Kong, denied the
allegations in an Oct. 12, 2010 letter to investors. </p>
<p>The legal battle, which both the SFC and Tiger Asia''s
founder Bill Hwang have pledged to take to Hong Kong''s top
court, will determine whether the agency can sue independently
for relief without working through government departments to
bring a criminal case or civil inquiry. Tiger Asia''s lawyers
argue the regulator can''t use a provision for freezing assets to
bring its own lawsuit against them. </p>
<p>It was never intended that the SFC should have an
unchecked ability to seek a contravention of market
misconduct, Charles Sussex, representing Tiger Asia and its
officers, argued before the court yesterday. </p>
<p>Criminal proceedings or a civil tribunal inquiry are not
preconditions to investors taking action, said Judge Robert
Tang from the bench yesterday. If small investors don''t have
to wait, why should the SFC have to wait? </p>
<p>The three appeals court judges reserved their judgment and
will hand down their decision at a later date. </p>
<p>The case is Securities and Futures Commission and Tiger
Asia Management LLC, Sung Kook Hwang Bill, Raymond Park, William
Tomita, CACV178/2011 in the Hong Kong Court of Appeal. </p>
<h2>Some Stanford Assets Were Profitable, Ex-CFO Tells Jurors </h2>
<p>R. Allen Stanford''s businesses collapsed in part because
the stock market imploded and a court-appointed receiver
destroyed much of the companies'' value after they were seized by
the government, Ex-Stanford Financial Group Co. finance chief
James M. Davis told jurors. </p>
<p>Davis, testifying yesterday for the government under a plea
deal at Stanford''s federal court trial in Houston, was shown a
letter he wrote shortly after regulators seized Stanford''s
companies in February 2009. </p>
<p>There was from the start never a thought to put the
clients in harm''s way in this process, never a hint of criminal
intent, Robert Scardino, a lawyer for Stanford, read from the
letter, which Davis said he wrote to an attorney he was trying
to hire to defend him at the time. </p>
<p>The underlying global business growth model remained
strong, Davis wrote in the letter, adding that some of
Stanford''s businesses were moving toward profitability. </p>
<p>Isn''t that 180 degrees opposite from what you''ve been
telling this jury? Scardino asked Davis. You said these
companies had no value. </p>
<p>Davis responded, A number of the companies Stanford owned
were growing; they were worth something. The 2009 letter
could be true under certain circumstances, he said. </p>
<p>The former finance chief told jurors he changed his mind a
month after writing that letter, when he met with his current
attorney, who persuaded him to seek a plea deal. But at the
time I was still lying, he said of the letter. I was still
in the middle of it. </p>
<p>Davis''s testimony may bolster Stanford''s defense that he
never intended to defraud investors of $7 billion through what
the government says was a Ponzi scheme built on bogus
certificates of deposit at Antigua-based Stanford International
Bank. </p>
<p>Stanford''s lawyers claim accountants were in the process of
consolidating companies the financier funded with $2 billion in
secret bank loans onto the Antiguan bank''s portfolio when
regulators stepped in and stopped the process. </p>
<p>The criminal case is U.S. v. Stanford, 09-cr-00342, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston). The SEC
case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Stanford
International Bank, 09-cv-00298, U.S. District Court, Northern

<h2>New Suits </h2>
<h2>Acer Sues Former Chief Lanci Over Non-Compete Clause </h2>
<p>Acer Inc. (2353) sued former president and chief executive officer
Gianfranco Lanci in an Italian court seeking damages for breach
of a non-compete clause, the Taipei-based company said in an e-
mailed statement yesterday. </p>
<p>Lanci left Acer last year after helming the company for
more than six years. Rival Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) in September
announced he would join the company as a consultant, and last
month named him head of its newly-created Europe, Middle-East
and Africa unit. </p>
<p>Acer Chairman J.T. Wang and Lanci met March 28 last year to
agree on the terms of the Italian''s departure after they
couldn''t resolve disagreements over the company''s future
direction, Wang said in a May interview. Lanci''s resignation was
announced three days later, exposing a feud between the two
sides over product strategy and internationalization of the
Taiwanese company. Lanci confirmed accounts of that meeting in a
separate interview. </p>
<p>We believe Mr. Lanci has breached his non-compete
measures agreed into willingly by both parties when he left
Acer, the company said in yesterday''s statement.  We are
taking legal action against him in order to protect Acer''s
rights and interests.'''' </p>
<p>Calls to Lanci''s Italian mobile phone and e-mail to his
personal account weren''t answered. </p>

<h2>Verdicts/Settlements </h2>
<h2>JPMorgan Reaches Tentative Settlement in AFTRA Pension Suit </h2>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. and the American Federation of
Television and Radio Artists Retirement Fund reached an
agreement in principal to settle a suit claiming losses from
the bank''s securities lending program. </p>
<p>The settlement is to be announced on the plaintiffs''
website, according to a statement provided yesterday by
Stephanie Cirkovich, a spokeswoman for the federal court in
Manhattan, where the AFTRA fund filed its suit. </p>
<p>The parties are drafting a formal settlement agreement,
to be submitted to the court for approval within approximately
three weeks, according to the statement. The settlement
terms will remain confidential until the agreement is submitted
to the court.The settlement is subject to the court''s approval
and to certain other conditions. </p>
<p>The fund sued in 2009, claiming it lost money that New
York-based JPMorgan invested for it in medium-term notes issued
by Sigma Finance Corp., a structured investment vehicle that
collapsed in 2008. </p>
<p>The case is Board of Trustees of the AFTRA Retirement Fund
v. JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 09-cv-686, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<h2>California Gay Marriage Ban Ruled Unlawful by Appeals Court </h2>
<p>California''s voter-backed Proposition 8 law declaring
marriage to be only between a man and a woman was ruled
unconstitutional by a federal appeals court. </p>
<p>The San Francisco-based court, ruling 2-1, yesterday upheld
the 2010 decision of a federal court judge who said the measure
violated constitutional equal protection rights of same-sex
couples. That ruling came in the first federal trial over
whether it''s legal to ban marriage by gays and lesbians. </p>
<p>The people may not employ the initiative power to single
out a disfavored group for unequal treatment and strip them,
without a legitimate justification, of a right as important as
the right to marry, the U.S. Court of Appeals said in its
ruling. </p>
<p>Proponents and advocates of Proposition 8 had appealed the
decision of U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker in San Francisco.
They argued that that the measure, which was approved by 52
percent of California voters in 2008 after the California
Supreme Court legalized gay marriage, reflected the traditional
definition of marriage and furthered the state''s interests in
responsible procreation. </p>
<p>The appeals court yesterday kept in place its earlier order
putting Walker''s ruling on hold. Proposition 8 proponents said
they will continue their court battle to uphold the measure and
hope to win in the U.S. Supreme Court (1000L). </p>
<p>We are not surprised that this Hollywood-orchestrated
attack on marriage -- tried in San Francisco -- turned out this
way, Brian Raum, an attorney for proponents and senior counsel
at the legal group Alliance Defense Fund, said in an e-mail.
But we are confident that the expressed will of the American
people in favor of marriage will be upheld at the Supreme
Court. </p>
<p>Every pro-marriage American should be pleased that this
case can finally go to the U.S. Supreme Court (1000L), Raum said. </p>
<p>Carla Hass, another attorney for the Proposition 8
proponents, said her clients were deciding whether to petition
for a rehearing of the case before a larger panel of appeals
court judges, or petition the Supreme Court for review without
delay. An immediate appeal to the high court would allow for a
hearing during the nine-month term that starts in October. </p>
<p>The appeals court in San Francisco could decide on its own
to rehear the case before more judges, Hass said in a phone
interview. </p>
<p>The cases are Perry v. Brown, 11-17255 and 11-16577, U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, San Francisco. </p>

<h2>GlaxoSmithKline Among Companies Paying $25 Million to State </h2>
<p>Actavis Group HF and Merck  Co. Inc.''s Schering-Plough
were among five companies that paid a total of $25.2 million to
settle claims that they overcharged Louisiana for drugs for low-
income patients. </p>
<p>The two companies and Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Dey Pharma
LP and GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) resolved civil claims that they
inflated drug prices to get larger reimbursements from the
state''s Medicaid program, Louisiana Attorney General James
Buddy Caldwell said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. The
state claimed the companies misreported average wholesale prices
for the drugs. </p>
<p>Louisiana has sued more than 100 drug companies, accusing
them of fraud and violating the state''s unfair trade practices
and consumer protection law. The statement didn''t specify the
amount that each company is paying. </p>
<p>Representatives of GlaxoSmithKline, Actavis, Boehringer
Ingelheim and Dey Pharma didn''t immediately return phone calls.
Ron Rogers, a spokesman for Merck, didn''t have an immediate
comment. </p>
<h2>Fourteen Hospitals Reach $12 Million False Claims Accord </h2>
<p>Fourteen hospitals in New York and six other states agreed
to pay more than $12 million in total to settle allegations that
they submitted false claims to Medicare, the U.S. Justice
Department said. </p>
<p>Four hospitals affiliated with Adventist Health
System/Sunbelt Inc. in Florida will pay the largest sum, $3.9
million, according to an e-mailed statement by the Justice
Department. Plainview Hospital in Plainview, New York, will pay
$2.3 million, the largest single hospital payment, the agency
said. </p>
<p>The settlement resolves civil claims that the hospitals
overcharged Medicare for eight years starting in 2000 for the
cost of performing kyphoplasty procedures, which treat spinal
fractures due to osteoporosis. In total, more than 40 hospitals
have paid at least $39 million to settle such overbilling
claims, the Justice Department said. </p>
<p>By recovering taxpayer dollars lost to improper billing,
this settlement will help support the vital public health care
programs we depend on, Assistant Attorney General Tony West
said in the statement. </p>
<p>The settlements follow a 2008 whistle-blower lawsuit
brought under the False Claims Act by two men who had worked for
Kyphon Inc., a maker of surgical equipment. The men, a former
regional sales manager and an ex-reimbursement manager, will
collect a total $2.1 million from the settlements. </p>
<p>Plainview Hospital, which is part of the North Shore-Long
Island Jewish Health System, said in a statement that the
dispute concerned technical billing allegations, and it
denied violating the law. </p>
<p>Settlement without any admission of liability avoids the
significant costs and distraction of litigation against the
government, the hospital said. Representatives of Adventist
Health System didn''t immediately respond to phone calls seeking
comment on the settlement. </p>

<h2>Court News </h2>
<h2>Rajaratnam Judge Announces Departure in Press Release </h2>
<p>The U.S. judge who sentenced Raj Rajaratnam to 11 years in
prison for insider trading after a trial where he often closed
proceedings and sealed files used a public relations firm to
announce he was quitting the bench. </p>
<p>Richard Holwell, 65, revealed his departure yesterday in a
press release advertising the creation of his new Manhattan law
firm, Holwell Shuster  Goldberg. The announcement was
circulated by Hellerman Baretz Communications LLC. </p>
<p>In response to a question last week on reports he planned
to leave the judiciary, Holwell said he told a court spokeswoman
it''s not his practice to talk about my future plans. </p>
<p>I gave the chief judge a heads-up a week or two ago,
Holwell said yesterday in an interview, referring to U.S.
District Judge Loretta Preska. I didn''t think it was
appropriate to ask the court to issue a press release, Holwell
said. I thought I should be the guy to do it. </p>
<p>The announcement comes a day after Holwell published his
last ruling in the Rajaratnam case, a 39-page opinion giving the
reasons for how he calculated the applicable federal sentencing
guidelines. The hedge fund manager''s sentence was the longest in
U.S. history for insider trading. </p>
<p>Holwell said he wanted to finish that ruling before leaving
the bench, along with a decision in a securities case against
Vivendi SA (VIV) and another denying a request to block toll increases
on New York-area bridges and tunnels. His new firm opened
yesterday, according to the press release. </p>
<p>Holwell spent more than 30 years as an attorney with White
 Case LLP (1116L) in Manhattan before President George W. Bush
appointed him to the federal bench in 2003. </p>
<p>Holwell''s new firm includes Michael Shuster and Daniel
Goldberg, lawyers he practiced with at White  Case. Holwell
Shuster  Goldberg plans to represent clients in complex
commercial, securities, antitrust and bankruptcy litigation,
according to the press release. </p>

<p>Turkey may see more of its companies
acquired as buyers raise offers to match premiums demanded by
sellers, according to Utku Ozay, an executive director at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>The gap between valuations and buyers is decreasing, and
that''s basically because buyers are increasing their
valuations, Ozay said at a conference on acquisition finance
in Istanbul yesterday. For the right story, there is
willingness to pay more for Turkish companies. Prices are
increasing, the multiples are increasing, so we may see more
deals. </p>
<p>Turkey had 114 mergers and acquisitions worth $9.3 billion
last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The country
may attract between $12 billion and $13 billion in 2012, Ilker
Ayci, head of the Investment Support and Promotion Agency, told
Hurriyet newspaper in December. The figure could reach as much
as $26 billion, according to Istanbul-based brokerage BGC
Partners. </p>
<p>Failure to close deals in Turkey in the past has been
largely due to unwillingness to pay the premiums Turkish sellers
demand, Ozay said. </p>
<p>It''s not a lack of interest, it''s basically not being
able to come to an agreement on valuation. </p>
<p>Turkish deal flow may also be increased by conglomerates
selling off assets to invest in energy and infrastructure, which
are expected to be key growth areas in Turkey, according to
Mustafa Tiftikcioglu, senior vice president in charge of project
and acquisition finance at Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS, who was
also speaking at the seminar. </p>
<p>Conglomerates who want to take significant positions in
energy or infrastructure will dispose of non-core assets, he
said. </p>
<p>More than $10 billion of Turkish energy grid privatizations
last year were canceled after the winning bidders at auction
failed to make the down-payments necessary to complete the
transactions, indicating difficulty funding the deals, Ozay
said. </p>
<p>In Turkey, buyers tend to look for financing after they
win the asset, Ozay said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. held on to
almost all of the $6.2 billion in face value of mortgage bonds
that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York sold the company
yesterday, based on data from Trace, the transaction reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. </p>
<p>Customers bought $961 million of speculative-grade home-
loan bonds from dealers yesterday while selling $6.9 billion,
according to the data. Trading of investment-grade debt totaled
$385 million, while dealers traded about $45 million of both
types of bonds among themselves, the data show. </p>
<p>It certainly looks like they''re willing to provide
liquidity to the market by bidding for their own account, said
Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Montgomery
Scott LLC in Philadelphia. It''s a little bit of shift, after
a period in which dealers reduced their inventories, he said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the most profitable securities firm in Wall
Street history before converting to a bank in 2008, won an
auction of bonds assumed in the U.S. central bank''s rescue of
American International Group Inc. (AIG) after the New York Fed put the
pool out for competitive bidding following an offer from Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN), the New York Fed said yesterday in a statement. </p>
<p>The weighted average price of non-investment grade, or
junk, securities traded yesterday was 57.8 cents on the dollar,
according to Trace data. High-yield, or junk, bonds are rated
lower than Baa3 by Moody''s Investors Service and below BBB- by
Standard  Poor''s. </p>
<p>On Jan. 19, when Credit Suisse won the New York Fed''s last
auction of bonds from its AIG-tied Maiden Lane II vehicle,
customers bought $4.7 billion of home-loan bonds with junk
ratings from dealers and sold $6.7 billion, the data showed. The
central bank sold $7 billion of securities that day. </p>
<p>Our intention has always been to distribute the portfolio
to our clients globally and we are in the midst of doing that,
Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman Sachs,
said today in an e-mail. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) raised $1.4 billion
in its fourth bond sale within a year as the biggest U.S.
entertainment company by market value takes advantage of
corporate bond yields at about record lows. </p>
<p>The company issued $1 billion of 1.125 percent, five-year
notes that yield 47 basis points above similar-maturity
Treasuries and $400 million of 2.55 percent, 10-year debt at a
62 basis-point spread, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Before today''s offering, Burbank, California-based Disney had
sold $3.95 billion of bonds since May, the data show. </p>
<p>Disney joined blue-chip American companies from Procter 
Gamble Co. to McDonald''s Corp. in snagging borrowing costs at
almost all-time lows as the Federal Reserve pledges to hold
interest rates near zero percent through at least late 2014.
Average yields on investment-grade debt sank to 3.53 percent
yesterday, 8 basis points above the record low of 3.45 percent
reached in August, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data. </p>
<p>We''ve obviously increased our debt because of the
availability of money at these great rates, Chief Financial
Officer James Rasulo said in a Feb. 7 conference call to discuss
earnings. For what we borrowed in both the amounts and our
rating, we really almost always in the past year saw
historically low coupon rates on that debt. </p>
<p>The company cut borrowing costs on both of its issues
today, Bloomberg data show. Disney offered $750 million of 1.35
percent, five-year notes in August, a record low at that time,
and $750 million of 2.75 percent, 10-year debt. </p>
<h2>Timing Debt Issues </h2>
<p>In Disney''s previous bond sale in November, the company set
a 0.875 percent coupon on $1 billion of three-year notes, its
lowest ever, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>We''ve timed our steps into the debt marketplace very
carefully and put a lot of time into picking what we think will
be a low entry points and we''ve been very successful in doing
that, Rasulo said. </p>
<p>Before the string of offerings in the past year, Disney had
last tapped the market in 2009 for $500 million of 5.5 percent
notes, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>The company is graded A2 by Moody''s Investors Service and
an equivalent A by Standard  Poor''s and Fitch Ratings,
Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Disney has room to issue more debt while maintaining its
single-A credit grade, which served us incredibly well over
the past decade including when liquidity dried up for most
companies in 2008, Rasulo said in the conference call this
week. </p>
<p>We''ve got a couple of maturities that we''d like to fill
in and when we see the opportunity to step in at great rates I
think you''ll see us doing that, he said. As time passes
we''ll have some maturities that we''ll refill but don''t expect us
to back the truck up to the point where we have to give up that
great debt, that great balance sheet and great Standard  Poor''s
rating. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will begin handing
out test versions of Windows 8 computers running chips with ARM
Holdings Plc (ARM)''s technology, part of its push to release devices
that can compete with Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s iPad tablet. </p>
<p>Microsoft wants ARM-based devices to go on sale at the same
time as computers sporting chips from Intel Corp. (INTC) The ARM-based
test computers, featuring chips made by Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM), Texas
Instruments Inc. (TXN) and Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), will go to partners and
software developers in the next several weeks, Microsoft Windows
President Steven Sinofsky said in an interview. </p>
<p>The first broadly available test version of Windows 8 will
be distributed Feb. 29, and Microsoft has so far only provided
developers with machines running Intel''s chips. Because the
company also wants the next version of its operating system to
gain a foothold in the tablet-computer market dominated by ARM-
based machines like the iPad, it''s important for Microsoft to
have an ARM product available quickly. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s Windows unit is releasing a personal-computer
operating system for the first time that runs on ARM chips.
Previous versions of Windows for PCs have run on x86 chips from
Intel and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Still, Microsoft should be
able to get ARM-based products in stores at the same time,
Sinofsky said, while declining to comment on when the products
will be released. </p>
<h2>Release Target </h2>
<p>Our collective goal is for them to ship at the same time
as PCs with Windows 8 on x86, he said. I wouldn''t be saying
it''s a goal if I didn''t think we could do it. </p>
<p>Sinofsky will discuss Microsoft''s efforts to release
Windows with ARM technology in an approximately 8,000-word blog
post today. </p>
<p>Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, will start to
distribute thousands of the test machines around the same time
it unveils the Windows 8 Consumer Preview at a mobile conference
in Barcelona, Spain. </p>
<p>Revenue from Windows software, which runs most of the
world''s PCs, has missed analysts'' estimates in four of the past
five quarters, in part because some consumers are defecting from
laptops with Windows to tablets like the iPad. Microsoft
probably won''t be able to significantly change that trend until
Windows 8 goes on sale, Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein said
in an interview last month. </p>
<h2>Preinstalled Software </h2>
<p>Windows on ARM will only be sold preinstalled on computers
and all applications and updates for the product will be
distributed through the Windows apps store only, Sinofsky said.
That''s different from the x86 version, which will also be
available for purchase separately from the hardware. </p>
<p>That lets Microsoft closely control how the ARM machines
run and ensure that everything works -- akin to other
electronics, such as TV set-top boxes and game consoles, which
are built and sold with hardware and software in the same
package. </p>
<p>Microsoft will include versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint
and the OneNote note-taking application on the Windows on ARM
devices, Sinofsky said. </p>
<p>As with x86 machines, Windows 8 on ARM will let users
choose either the new Metro design, which features tiles that
update with new information, or revert to the current Windows
design, Sinofsky said. Unlike x86, the ARM machines won''t be
able to run older applications such as those written for the
current version of Windows, he said. </p>
<p>If you are a customer, whether an enterprise or an
individual, and there is an existing Windows program you
absolutely have to run, you''ll be best served by a PC with one
of the Intel or AMD chips that can run that software, he said. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the largest software
maker, said it would be fair and reasonable in licensing its
industry-standard technology, pledging to negotiate with
competitors instead of trying to block sales of their products. </p>
<p>Microsoft also will make its industry-essential patents
available without requiring companies to cross-license their own
non-essential technology, according to a posting yesterday on
the company''s website. The pledge comes as Google Inc. prepares
a similar promise to appease regulators scrutinizing its
acquisition of Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. </p>
<p>Motorola Mobility has sued Microsoft and Apple Inc. (AAPL) for
infringing patents that are covered partly by standards in which
companies agree to share technology that is common across their
industry. Google, which has drawn scrutiny over the acquisition,
plans to send the letter to standards organizations reassuring
them it will license Motorola Mobility patents on fair terms,
according to two people with knowledge of the situation who
asked not to be named because the decision isn''t yet public. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s statement didn''t name any companies, and a
spokesman for the software maker, Kevin Kutz, declined to
comment. Jennifer Erickson, a spokeswoman for Libertyville,
Illinois-based Motorola Mobility, and Kristin Huguet of Apple
also wouldn''t comment. Jim Prosser, a spokesman for Google in
Mountain View, California, didn''t immediately respond to an e-
mail. </p>
<p>Motorola Mobility has sought sales bans in Germany on Apple
products using standard-essential patents, and is seeking to
halt U.S. imports of Microsoft''s Xbox gaming system. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s policy announced today doesn''t bar the company
from seeking bans on the use of patented technology that isn''t
part of an industry standard or from suing to demand
compensation for the use of the essential patents. </p>
<p>Apple, based in Cupertino, California, sent a letter in
November to the European Telecommunications Standards Institute
saying the industry suffers from a lack of consistent
adherence to policies that require companies to license
standard-essential patents on fair, reasonable and non-
discriminatory terms. </p>
<p>In that letter, reported yesterday by the Wall Street
Journal, Apple said companies that pledge to license their
patents on fair terms can''t seek to prevent use of the
inventions without being in violation of their commitment. </p>
<h2>Facebook CEO Won''t Have to Answer Questions in Patent Case </h2>
<p>Facebook Inc. (FB) Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg won''t
have to give pretrial testimony in a patent-infringement lawsuit
filed by a mobile networking company. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel in Manhattan yesterday
denied a request by Wireless Ink Corp. to depose Facebook co-
founder Zuckerberg. </p>
<p>If the CEO of Facebook has relevant knowledge not readily
available from other sources, Wireless Ink ought to be able to
establish this from documents produced in discovery or the
testimony of other employees of Facebook, Castel said in his
order. </p>
<p>Wireless Ink, which operates the Winksite social networking
service, said in a complaint filed in 2010 that Facebook Mobile
and Google Inc. (GOOG)''s Google Buzz infringed a patent related to ways
of offering content on mobile devices. </p>
<p>Facebook''s lawyers said in a letter to the judge that
Wireless Ink has not identified any relevant knowledge that
Mr. Zuckerberg uniquely possesses that cannot be obtained from
other witnesses. </p>
<p>Facebook, based in Menlo Park, California, is planning an
initial public offering of stock. </p>
<p>The case is Wireless Ink Corp. v. Facebook Inc., 10-01841,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<p>USPTO''s Patents for Humanity'' Prize to Speed Up Office Process </p>
<p>The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has set up a project
that will move some patent owners to the head of the line for
proceedings within the office if their patented technology has
been used for neglected humanitarian issues. </p>
<p>The Patent for Humanity project, which will run for 12
months, is aimed at public health  or quality-of-life issues
affected the poor, the patent office said in a statement
yesterday. </p>
<p>Judges, drawn from academia in medicine, law science,
engineering, public policy or a related field, will consider
applications in four categories: medical, food and nutrition,
clean technology and information technology. </p>
<p>Winners will receive an acceleration certificate which
can move several different kinds of patent-office procedures to
the head of the line, including patent appeals and re-
examinations. The certificate can be used for one item in the
winner''s portfolio, regardless of whether it is related to the
humanitarian program. </p>
<p>The submission period for applications runs from March 1
through Aug. 31. </p>
<h2>Copyright </h2>
<h2>Lenovo, Computer Makers Settle Case Over Green Dam Software </h2>
<p>Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) and other computer makers settled a
lawsuit brought by a California software maker who had claimed
the Green Dam software installed on personal computers in China
infringes its copyright. </p>
<p>The parties have reached a settlement resolving the
entire case, Cybersitter LLC, the software maker, said Feb. 7
in a filing in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana, California.
Terms of the settlement weren''t disclosed in the filing. </p>
<p>Closely held Cybersitter sued China, seven computer makers
and two Chinese software makers in 2010, seeking $2.2 billion in
damages over allegations the Green Dam program illegally copies
more than 3,000 lines of code from Cybersitter''s Internet
content-filtering program. The Chinese government made Green Dam
mandatory on personal computers sold there in 2009. </p>
<p>Researchers in China have reported that Green Dam contains
more than 6,500 political keyword filters, including words
related to China''s control of Tibet, the 1989 Tiananmen Square
massacre and the government-banned Falun Gong religious group,
Cybersitter said in its complaint. </p>
<p>Researchers at the University of Michigan said in a 2009
report that Green Dam could impair computer performance by
making machines more prone to security breaches. </p>
<p>A report that same year from the OpenNet Initiative, which
includes researchers at the University of Cambridge, University
of Oxford and University of Toronto, called Green Dam, a
substandard product developed by companies with little
experience in such software. </p>
<p>Robert Schwartz, a lawyer for Lenovo in Los Angeles, and
Elliot Gipson, a lawyer for Santa Barbara, California-based
Cybersitter, didn''t immediately return calls seeking comment on
the settlement. </p>
<p>Gipson said in a telephone interview last month that China
hadn''t responded to the complaint and that U.S. District Judge
Josephine Staton Tucker last year granted a motion for entry of
default against the country. </p>
<p>The case is Cybersitter v. the People''s Republic of China,
U.S. District Court, Central District of California (Santa Ana). </p>
<h2>Pornography Not Copyrightable, Infringement Defendant Argues </h2>
<p>A resident of California''s Solano County has presented a
novel defense to allegations of copyright infringement made by
lawyers for an adult film company. </p>
<p>Liuxia Wong, who filed a complaint seeking a court
declaration she hasn''t infringed a copyright belonging to Hard
Drive Productions Inc., says the work in question isn''t entitled
to copyright protection. </p>
<p>In her complaint filed Jan. 30 in federal court in San
Francisco, she argues that the U.S. Constitution''s Copyright
Clause protects only works which promote the progress of
science and the useful arts. The film she is accused of
infringing -- Amateur Allure Jen -- fails to meet the
constitutional requirements for protection, she said in her
pleadings. </p>
<p>The film depicts obscene material, does not promote
the useful arts and does not promote the progress of
science, Wong claims. </p>
<p>She also argued that Hard Drive demanded $3,400 from her so
she could avoid being named a defendant in an infringement
action. </p>
<p>Included in her case filing is a demand letter from Steele
Hansmeier LLC, a Chicago law firm. The letter tells her that she
can work out a settlement with us and avoid the costs of
attorney fees and the uncertainty associated with jury
verdicts by mailing the firm a check for $3,400. The firm said
if she settled she would remain anonymous. </p>
<p>Wong called the firm''s actions intimidation, claiming she
didn''t download the movie or authorize anyone else using her
computer to download it. </p>
<p>She asked the court to declare she wasn''t liable for
infringement and that the film wasn''t copyrightable.
Additionally, she sought an order barring Hard Drive from
demanding settlements not supported by facts and law and for
awards of litigation costs and attorney fees. </p>
<p>Wong is represented by Aaron K. McClellan and Steven W.
Yuen of Murphy Pearson Bradley  Feeney of San Francisco. </p>
<p>The case is Liuxia Wong v. Hard Drive Productions Inc.,

California (San Francisco). </p>

<h2>Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage </h2>
<h2>Ericsson Sued by Airvana in New York for $330 Million </h2>
<p>Ericsson AB, the world''s largest maker of wireless
networks, was sued for more than $330 million by Airvana Network
Solutions Inc., which says Ericsson misappropriated intellectual
property. </p>
<p>Ericsson secretly developed a product based on Airvana
trade secrets to operate wireless network equipment in order to
avoid paying software licensing fees, Airvana said in a
complaint filed yesterday in New York state court. </p>
<p>Ericsson has now undertaken a blatant ploy to evade its
contractual obligations, by developing a secret in-house''
project designed to misappropriate critical Airvana intellectual
property, the company said. </p>
<p>Ericsson, which depended on Airvana''s technology to service
customers, constantly badgered Airvana to reduce the price
of the software and began development of its own product in
2010, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>Airvana, based in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, said it has
suffered damages of more than $330 million and will face an
immediate and precipitous decline in revenue if Ericsson is
able to displace the company with its own product. </p>
<p>A spokesman for Stockholm''s Ericsson couldn''t be reached
for comment. </p>
<p>The case is Airvana Network Solutions Inc. v. Ericsson
Inc., 650360-2012, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan). </p>
<h2>Ex-Motorola Worker Guilty of Trade Secret Theft, Judge Rules </h2>
<p>Hanjuan Jin, a former Motorola Inc. (MMI) software engineer
charged with stealing trade secrets from the company, was found
guilty and acquitted of economic espionage to benefit a foreign
government. </p>
<p>Jin was tried in Chicago before U.S. District Judge Ruben Castillo in November after being indicted on three counts of
stealing trade secrets and three more counts of economic
espionage. She waived her right to a jury. </p>
<p>Yesterday Castillo found her guilty of stealing trade
secrets and acquitted her on the three counts of economic
espionage. </p>
<p>I conclude that Ms. Jin criminally betrayed Motorola by
stealing its trade secrets, the judge said. </p>
<p>Castillo allowed Jin to remain in home confinement and
scheduled sentencing for April 18. </p>
<p>Jin, 41, faces as long as 10 years in prison on the trade
secrets conviction. She faced as long as 15 years in prison on
each of the economic espionage counts. </p>
<p>She was indicted in 2008, a year after she returned to
Schaumburg, Illinois-based Motorola following a yearlong medical
leave of absence and immediately stepped down. </p>
<p>U.S. Customs agents stopped her as she was about to board a
plane at Chicago''s O''Hare International Airport on Feb. 28,
2007. In her possession were more than 1,000 Motorola documents,
$30,000 in cash and a one-way ticket to China. </p>
<p>She was accused of simultaneously working for Motorola and
for a Beijing-based company, Kai Sun News (Beijing) Technology
Co., also known as SunKaisens, which was affiliated with China''s
military. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Jin, 08-cr-192, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of Illinois (Chicago). </p>
<h2>Trademark </h2>
<h2>EKA-AZS Challenges Trademark Infringement Award to Rosneft </h2>
<p>EKA-AZS, the operator of a chain of gas stations in the
Moscow region, is challenging the award the Moscow Commercial
Court made to Rosneft Oil Co. (ROSN) in a trademark-infringement suit,
the Russian Legal Information Agency said in a statement. </p>
<p>In 2005 the two companies entered into a franchise
agreement for EKA-AZS to use the trademark on 40 gasoline
filling stations for five years. </p>
<p>The suit involved the use of the Rosneft trademark for five
months after a contract between the two companies for the use of
the mark expired in 2010. </p>
<p>In December the court reduced the judgment against EKA-AZS
from 5 million rubles ($168,000) to 3 million. </p>

<p>Brian Kuritzky ran the 1,576 steps up
New York''s tallest building in the time it usually takes him to
grab lunch at the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) cafeteria. </p>
<p>Kuritzky, a 25-year-old security analyst, raised $100,000
for the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation by completing the
1,050-foot stair climb at the 35th Annual Empire State Building
Run-Up in 12 minutes, 52 seconds last night. </p>
<p>In these 12 minutes I ran up 86 flights of stairs,
Kuritzky said in an interview from the Empire State Building''s
observation deck. That''s a bit more productive. </p>
<p>The event, which began with 15 competitors in 1977,
featured runners from 20 to 78 years of age from 25 countries
including Australia, Japan, Mexico and Turkey. The race expects
to raise more than $475,000 for MMRF. </p>
<p>Thomas Dold of Germany won the men''s invitational, his
record seventh consecutive title, with a time of 10:28. Melissa
Moon of New Zealand (12:39) triumphed in the women''s division. </p>
<p>Kuritzky''s friends, family and co-workers pledged $10,000
for each of the 10 runners he beat in the men''s invitational
heat. He finished 14th, raising $100,000. </p>
<p>There was an unbelievable amount of support for me once
they heard it was a charitable event, Kuritzky said. It''s
very humbling. </p>
<h2>Charity Runs </h2>
<p>Kuritzky, whose mother died of breast cancer when he was
15, has run the New York City marathon and a 140.6-mile (226
kilometer) iron-distance triathlon to raise funds for cancer
research. </p>
<p>The event was invitation only before last year, when MMRF
first became the benefiting charity. This year featured a wave
of about 100 charity runners, each of whom raised a minimum of
$2,500 for MMRF. </p>
<p>As snow fell outside, runners spread the workload between
their arms and legs by pulling themselves up along the handrail.
Moon, who won the event in 2010, said the snowy nighttime finish
was a dream come true. </p>
<p>It''s so special to be able to finish the race at the
Empire State Building at night, the 42-year-old New Zealander
said in an interview. It all unfolded just the way I
visualized it. </p>
<h2>Backward Running </h2>
<p>Dold also holds a world record in the 10-kilometer backward
run, according to his website. He said this was one of the
toughest races he''s had at the Empire State Building. </p>
<p>The biggest thing for me is not to look at the others,
Dold, 27, said. I''m not able to go 100 percent the whole time,
so pacing myself is the strategy. </p>
<p>A 10-team corporate division race was won by Joe Walsh,
Greg Maurer-Hollaender and Russell Kempf of CBRE Group Inc. (CBG), the
world''s biggest commercial real-estate services firm, with a
combined time of 46:01. </p>
<p>The course record of 9:33 was set by Paul Crake in 2003,
according to the New York Road Runners, which also organizes the
New York City Marathon. The woman''s record of 11:23 was set in
2006. </p>
<p>Chrissie Wellington, a four-time Ironman World Champion,
finished third in the women''s race at 13:15. The 34-year-old
from the U.K. said she didn''t decide to run until noon
yesterday, while she was in town promoting a memoir about her
athletic career. </p>
<h2>Mind Over Matter'' </h2>
<p>Wellington, who wants to enter more stair climb events,
said the Run-Up was more painful than a triathlon. </p>
<p>Whether you''re doing a triathlon or you''re doing this,
it''s all mind over matter, she said. Your body hurts and you
want to give up, and it''s just having the mental strength to
resist those urges. </p>
<p>Kuritzky said he had to push himself to continue after
reaching the halfway point. </p>
<p>I hit the 43rd floor and thought, Okay I made it
halfway,'' and my body said, Well that''s about all I can do,''
he said. You have this vision of it being a lot easier and
when you''re running it''s so much more challenging. </p>
<p>A former Cornell University soccer player, Kuritzky said he
trained mostly by running and playing sports. He said it was
hard to train on stairs because there''s no structure even close
to tall enough to simulate the challenge of the Empire State
Building. </p>
<p>He was at work yesterday and said he''d be up at 6 a.m. to
return to work on time this morning. </p>
<p>The legs won''t be happy with me, but I will sleep very
well tonight, he said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, will face claims in court that it
had conflicting interests when it advised El Paso Corp. in its
$21.1 billion buyout by oil-pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMI) </p>
<p>Delaware Chancery Court Judge Leo Strine will hear
arguments in Wilmington today from El Paso shareholders that
Kinder Morgan''s $25.91-a-share bid for the pipeline company
should be put on hold so other potential offers can be pursued.
The original offer was tainted by Goldman Sachs''s conflicting
roles in the deal, lawyers for pension funds and other investors
said in court filings. </p>
<p>This case presents a rare combination of deliberate
indifference to an adviser''s flagrant conflicts with the soft
but powerful harm from undisclosed management conflicts,
lawyers for the investors said in a Feb. 3 filing. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s business practices have been criticized
over the past two years after the New York-based company agreed
to pay $550 million to resolve government claims that marketing
materials about investments linked to subprime mortgages had
incomplete information. </p>
<p>It was the largest penalty ever levied by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission against a Wall Street firm.
Goldman Sachs also faced questions from politicians and labor
unions about its compensation system after getting taxpayer aid
during the financial crisis. </p>
<p>Given all the bad press Goldman has gotten recently, it
might have been better if they''d taken a pass on serving as an
adviser in this deal, said Charles Elson, a finance professor
at the University of Delaware who runs the school''s Weinberg
Center for Corporate Governance. </p>
<h2>Reasonable Measures'' </h2>
<p>Lawyers for Goldman Sachs and El Paso countered in their
court filings that the investment bank took reasonable
measures to deal with potential conflicts and Goldman''s
advisers didn''t compromise El Paso directors'' consideration of
the buyout proposal. </p>
<p>Lawyers for a Louisiana pension fund contend Goldman Sachs
has long-standing ties to Kinder Morgan, helping Richard Kinder,
the firm''s chief executive officer, take the Houston-based
pipeline operator private in 2006. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs wound up with a 19 percent stake in Kinder
Morgan and has its designees in two of the company''s board
seats, the fund''s lawyers say. The investment bank then reaped
millions of dollars by leading Kinder Morgan''s initial public
offering in 2011, they said. </p>
<h2>Didn''t Provide Enough </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs also had advised El Paso over the years, the
investors'' lawyers said. When Kinder approached the rival
pipeline company about a buyout last year, El Paso executives
called in Goldman Sachs as an adviser. </p>
<p>El Paso''s board ultimately agreed to Kinder''s $25.91-a-
share bid, which includes both cash and stock, and provides a 37
premium to shareholders, officials for the company said last
year. Investors contend the offer didn''t provide enough for
their El Paso shares. </p>
<p>Goldman''s staggering conflict of interest was obvious
from the outset: With a stake in KMI worth over $4 billion,
every dollar shaved off the buyout price presented approximately
$150 million of savings for Goldman, the investors'' lawyers
said in the filing. </p>
<p>Investors'' lawyers contend Goldman Sachs officials
convinced El Paso directors that Kinder Morgan''s bid was the
best option and downplayed advantages of continuing independent
operations or spinning off parts of the company. </p>
<h2>Eyes Wide Open'' </h2>
<p>In their court filings, Goldman Sachs officials counter the
bank took steps to deal with any potential conflict, including
having Goldman directors on Kinder Morgan''s board recuse
themselves from considering the deal. </p>
<p>The bank also made sure El Paso officials were aware of
Goldman Sachs''s stake in Kinder Morgan and that they brought the
firm''s advisers in with their eyes wide open, lawyers for
Goldman Sachs said in their Jan. 26 filing. </p>
<p>El Paso also had Goldman Sachs''s advice double-checked by
executives of Morgan Stanley  Co., which served as a second
adviser in the deal, Goldman Sachs''s lawyers said. </p>
<p>Still, El Paso''s decision to bring Goldman Sachs in as an
adviser drew the ire of Morgan Stanley executives, court filings
show. </p>
<p>Steve Munger, a Morgan Stanley banker, said in an e-mail
that Goldman Sachs had an enormous conflict in the case and
that the investment bank''s decision to serve as one of El Paso''s
advisers was GS at its most shameless, investors'' lawyers
said in their filing. </p>
<h2>Both Sides </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s attorneys said that investors'' lawyers
portrayed the bank as a wrongdoer simply because it had
relationships with both sides of a buyout. </p>
<p>Every piece of Goldman Sachs''s advice is painted in the
most dastardly terms, allegedly motivated by rapacious and crude
objectives, the firm''s lawyers said. </p>
<p>Strine will have to decide whether the efforts of Goldman
Sachs and El Paso to ensure potential conflicts didn''t taint
consideration of Kinder Morgan''s offer inoculated the firms from
liability, said Larry Hamermesh, a professor at Widener
University (78130MF)''s law school in Wilmington who specializes in
corporate law. </p>
<h2>Del Monte Case </h2>
<p>If a board is fully aware an adviser has a conflict, and
decides to look past that and hire them anyway, I don''t see much
problem with that, Hamermesh said. </p>
<p>El Paso investors are hoping Strine will take note of a
colleague''s recent finding that Barclays Plc (BARC) executives had a
conflict when they served as a financial adviser to Del Monte
Foods Co. (DLM) in a buyout by private-equity firms led by KKR  Co. </p>
<p>Chancery Judge Travis Laster found Barclays officials had a
conflict because they provided some of the financing to the
private-equity firms buying the maker of Meow Mix cat food and
Milk Bone dog biscuits. </p>
<p>The judge put the deal on hold until the company could make
more disclosures about Barclay''s role in the acquisition. Del
Monte and Barclays later agreed to pay $89.4 million to settle
investor suits over the buyout that cited the conflict. </p>
<p>I think this Goldman case is being driven by the idea
that these conflict cases in Chancery are hot right now,
Hamermesh said. </p>
<p>The case is In re El Paso Corp. (EP) Shareholder Litigation,
Consolidated 6949-CS, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). </p>

<p>An electrical current sent deep into
the brain improves memory, according to a study that suggests a
novel approach to treating Alzheimer''s disease and dementia. </p>
<p>Seven volunteers with epilepsy who had electrodes implanted
in their brains to detect the source of their seizures
participated in the research to see if deep-brain stimulation
improved their recall. The results published in the New England
Journal of Medicine showed that information they learned while
the stimulation occurred was easier to remember and use. </p>
<p>The volunteers had varying memory strength at the start of
the study and all improved with the deep-brain stimulation, said
Itzhak Fried, the lead researcher and professor of neurosurgery
at the University of California, Los Angeles. The findings
suggest a novel approach to improving memory and mental function
in people with Alzheimer''s disease, dementia and trouble
remembering as they age, he said in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>Alzheimer''s disease is the big target here because it''s
such a huge problem with people getting older, said Matt
Stead, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota,
who wasn''t involved in the study. This is probably one of the
most hopeful things I''ve seen regarding Alzheimer''s disease in a
long time, because none of the medicines seem to do much. </p>
<p>Medtronic Inc. (MDT), based in Minneapolis, sells a deep-brain
stimulation device for Parkinson''s disease and obsessive-
compulsive disorder, and is studying it for depression. St. Jude
Medical Inc. (STJ), based in St. Paul, Minnesota, sells a similar
device in Europe and is conducting U.S. studies. Trying the
technique to improve memory is a natural extension, said Andres
Lozano, chairman of neurosurgery at the University of Toronto,
who wasn''t involved in the research and is doing similar work. </p>
<h2>Next Frontier'' </h2>
<p>Ninety thousand patients have received deep-brain
stimulation in the world, and about 10,000 patients get it every
year, Lozano said. The next frontier is to consider placing
electrodes in areas that control memory and cognitive function
to see if it can help with disturbances in those areas. </p>
<p>The volunteers in the study released yesterday played a
video game where they acted as a taxi cab driver shuttling
passengers across a virtual city. The electrodes received
electrical stimulation while they learned to get to three
stores, and were turned off for another three. </p>
<p>In a subsequent test, they were able to take shortcuts and
get more quickly to the stores they visited while the
stimulation was active. That showed improved spatial memory, a
key component of everyday living such as finding your car in a
parking lot and remembering where you stashed the keys, Fried
said. </p>
<h2>Brain Areas </h2>
<p>The location of the electrodes was key, Fried said.
Stimulation of the hippocampus, a key component of the brain
that converts short-term experience into long-term memory,
didn''t help. The hippocampus is one of the first areas where
destruction from Alzheimer''s disease occurs. However, the
stimulation was beneficial when it occurred at the entorhinal
cortex, which leads to the hippocampus, an area getting
increasing attention from Alzheimer''s disease researchers. </p>
<p>Tiny electrodes, measuring less than 2 millimeters in size,
were placed a little less than 2 inches into the brain. None of
the patients felt the stimulation. </p>
<p>What we found here was a particular golden gate, a small
area in the entorhinal cortex, where stimulation has a striking
effect on memory, Fried said. This is an area of the brain
which is critical in transformation of experience into lasting
memories. Everything you perceive now, everything that''s
committed to conscious memory, has to be funneled through this
system. </p>
<p>The U.S. National Institutes of Health and the Dana
Foundation funded the research. The investigators used
standalone electrodes in the study, rather than deep-brain
stimulation devices from Medtronic or St. Jude. </p>
<h2>Probing the Brain </h2>
<p>The study shows it''s possible to reach circuits in the
brain involved with processing memory and that electrical
stimulation can enhance their function, Lozano said. </p>
<p>The new findings support his earlier work involving six
Alzheimer''s disease patients who received constant deep-brain
stimulation for a year. Half of the patients progressed more
slowly than expected and one had a lasting benefit. Larger
studies are now being planned. The approach also restored some
of the brain''s ability to use glucose, suggesting it reactivated
areas of the brain that were previously shut down, he said. </p>
<p>This is the second study that shows you can stimulate
somewhere along the memory circuit of the brain and get a
benefit, Lozano said in a telephone interview. </p>
<h2>Theta Rhythm </h2>
<p>The researchers believe the benefit stemmed from resetting
the brain''s theta rhythm, altering the way large groups of cells
involved in memory function work. The two studies stimulated
different areas in the same segment of the brain, which Lozano
compared to a subway car stopping at different stations. </p>
<p>Stead, who typically performs deep-brain stimulation to
treat Parkinson''s disease, said the results mesh with earlier
studies that show such stimulation can cause new neurons to grow
and function normally. One man treated with brain stimulation
for extreme obesity spontaneously recalled events from decades
earlier, Stead said. </p>
<p>While it can take people about a year to get over the idea
of having electrodes implanted in the brain, they typically
don''t cause problems and the procedure can be done during a one-
day hospital stay, he said. </p>
<p>In the scope of brain surgery, it''s pretty minimal, he
said, comparing it to getting a pacemaker for the heart. </p>

<p>Lucas van Praag''s departure after 12
years as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s chief spokesman and the
possible hiring of a former U.S. Treasury Department aide to
replace him signal that Wall Street is ready to change its tone. </p>
<p>Van Praag, whose retirement was announced in an internal
memo yesterday, had a taste for dismissing negative press
reports about New York-based Goldman Sachs as chimera produced
by a febrile mind and effluent. The 62-year-old British
citizen''s style was described in a New York Observer profile as
basically a stiffly extended middle finger. </p>
<p>That may have suited the pre-2008 era, when Goldman Sachs
was still the most profitable securities firm in Wall Street
history and its employees the most richly rewarded. After an
economic collapse, taxpayer bailout, anti-Wall Street protests
and declining profits and pay, the entire industry has to find a
new approach, said Mark Arena, a former spokesman for Zurich-
based UBS AG (UBSN) who rates public relations efforts on
prverdict.com. </p>
<p>It''s far bigger than Goldman Sachs, it''s really a whole
shift in the way the industry is viewed, Arena said in a
telephone interview. The perception that they''re the smartest
people in the room has faded. </p>
<p>Arena, who worked at UBS, Switzerland''s largest bank, for
14 years and ran communications in the Americas before leaving
18 months ago, said Wall Street had become accustomed to being a
glamour industry thanks to its high pay and complexity.
Bankers and traders have been slow to recognize that the press
and public are no longer willing to accept Wall Street''s views
without question. </p>
<h2>Listening Mode </h2>
<p>A PR strategy that basically says, If you don''t
understand it you''re an idiot,'' that only works when markets are
going very high, he said. But when suddenly the industry was
having to be bailed out and there are all sorts of regulatory
problems, then the mood needs to change and you need to be much
more in listening mode, conciliatory mode, explanatory mode. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, led since mid-2006 by Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 57, has had an especially
hard time adapting. As a private partnership until 1999, the
firm''s employees were warned to avoid media attention. By 2007,
Goldman Sachs''s industry-leading profits -- and Blankfein''s
record-setting $67.9 million bonus -- gave the firm an aura of
invincibility. </p>
<p>That was stripped away in 2008 when the firm converted to a
bank one week after smaller rival Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc.''s bankruptcy and accepted a $10 billion rescue from the
Treasury Department -- led at the time by Henry Paulson,
Blankfein''s predecessor at Goldman Sachs. </p>
<h2>God''s Work'' </h2>
<p>Rolling Stone writer Matt Taibbi dubbed the firm a great
vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity in a 2009
article. An interview Blankfein granted to London''s Sunday Times
that year backfired when the paper splashed his sarcastic quip
that the firm''s employees were doing God''s work. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s image hit a low in April 2010 when the
Securities and Exchange Commission sued the firm for fraud,
alleging it misled investors about a mortgage-linked investment
sold in 2007. The company paid $550 million in July 2010 to
settle the charges, admitting only to making a mistake in
marketing materials. </p>
<p>Wall Street never had a lot of really bad press after
World War II until the present period, said Charles Geisst, a
finance professor at Manhattan College in Riverdale, New York,
who has written about the history of Wall Street. Now Goldman
Sachs is the most maligned financial institution in this
country and probably will remain so for a very long time. </p>
<h2>Considering Siewert </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs is considering replacing van Praag by hiring
Richard L. Jake Siewert Jr., a 48-year-old former aide to
Democrats including Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and
former President Bill Clinton, people familiar with the matter
said last week. </p>
<p>Siewert, who hasn''t been hired yet, has the career of a
Washington policy technocrat compared with the drama of van
Praag''s. The Goldman Sachs spokesman joined the British Navy
after being kicked out of boarding school, worked on an oil rig
and spent a decade at Bankers Trust where he arranged ship
finance, sold currency swaps and used his French and Dutch
language skills during a stint in Brussels. </p>
<p>Siewert is a graduate of Yale University and the University
of California at Berkeley''s law school. He started his
Washington career as communications director for the Democratic
Governors Association before working for Gene Sperling at the
National Economic Council during the Clinton administration. </p>
<h2>President''s Press Secretary </h2>
<p>He worked his way up in Clinton''s communications
department, eventually succeeding Joe Lockhart as the main press
secretary in the last few months of the presidency. At age 37 he
joined Pittsburgh-based Alcoa Inc., the largest aluminum
company, and managed corporate development and public strategy
before joining Geithner at Treasury in 2009. </p>
<p>David Wells, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York,
declined to comment. Van Praag didn''t immediately reply to an
e-mail seeking comment. </p>
<p>William Cohan, a Bloomberg View columnist who interviewed
Siewert last year, said he seemed very open and honest and
frank. Cohan, whose book Money and Power: How Goldman Sachs
Came to Rule the World was published last year, said Siewert
seems more like a regular guy than van Praag. </p>
<p>I do sense a little that because of Lucas''s demeanor, the
way he was brought up, that he might have seemed arrogant and
condescending, said Cohan, who said he himself found van Praag
warm and charming. </p>
<p>He doubts that the public perception of Goldman Sachs will
change as long as Blankfein is running the firm and economic
distress and regulatory change limits revenue. </p>
<h2>Paradigm Shift </h2>
<p>They think that they''re just a few innings away from the
status quo being restored but actually is there something else
going on, is there a real paradigm shift going on? Cohan said. </p>
<p>Even as Goldman Sachs was distributing a memo to employees
yesterday about van Praag''s retirement at the end of March,
Chief Financial Officer David A. Viniar was telling investors at
a conference in Miami that the company''s declining profit was a
temporary setback similar to the 2001 downturn. </p>
<p>During the question-and-answer session, one man -- who
described himself as a Goldman Sachs competitor and observer for
more than 40 years -- asked Viniar what Wall Street can do
differently to get its collective voice heard again. </p>
<p>Acknowledging that it''s a hard question, Viniar said
that time has to pass and the economy has to improve. In its
contacts with regulators about new rules, Goldman Sachs is
trying to emphasize what will help markets and the economy and
to talk less about what will be good for the industry, he said. </p>
<h2>Good for Business </h2>
<p>We need to convince people that''s really what we care
about, and obviously, those things will be good for our
business, said Viniar, 56. We have to make sure that those
things are more aligned than many had thought they were aligned
in the past. </p>
<p>To succeed, Wall Street has to find a new voice in an era
where people are less interested in what they have to say and
question their motives all the time, said Arena, the former
UBS spokesman. </p>
<p>Even if the message from the firm doesn''t change,
sometimes all that''s needed is a shift in tone, he said. A
tone that seems appeasing rather than instructive, that''s more
conciliatory rather than didactic. </p>

<p>Cobalt International Energy Inc. (CIE), a
deep-water oil explorer whose biggest investors include Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS), climbed to a record after test results at a
discovery off the coast of Angola exceeded the company''s
expectations. </p>
<p>Cobalt surged 33 percent to $31.68 in New York, its highest
close since the company first sold shares to the public in 
December 2009. </p>
<p>Work at the Cameia-1 well confirmed a 1,180-foot (360-
meter) oil column, the company said in a statement. Cobalt and
its partners will now begin to appraise the well to evaluate the
discovery''s size, according to the statement. </p>
<p>The results have exceeded our pre-drill expectations and
have increased our confidence in our entire West Africa pre-salt
exploration inventory, Joseph Bryant, chairman and chief
executive officer of Houston-based Cobalt, said in the
statement. </p>
<p>Cobalt said on Jan. 10 its Cameia-1 well in the Kwanza
basin found a high-quality oil reservoir. BP Plc (BP/),
ConocoPhillips (COP) and Total SA are among oil producers that won
licenses in Angola''s pre-salt areas largely running from the
equator south to the Tropic of Capricorn. </p>
<p>Energy companies are exploring possible oil reservoirs
below a layer of salt more than two miles beneath the seabed off
Africa''s coast. That follows success off Brazil on the South
American side of the Atlantic in finding some of the largest
fields of the last decade under the same mineral. </p>
<h2>Drilling Plan </h2>
<p>The Cameia well may have the potential to produce more than
20,000 barrels of oil a day, according to Cobalt, which has
wells in the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa. The company said it
plans to start drilling at the Cameia-2 well this month, work
that''s expected to take 100 to 120 days. </p>
<p>This basically confirms pre-salt hydrocarbons within this
trend and opens up opportunity on the other multiple prospects
that Cobalt holds in the area, including Gabon, Scott Hanold,
an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in Minneapolis, said in a
telephone interview today. </p>
<p>The Cameia prospect area may have close to 2.5 billion
barrels gross, based on preliminary results, said Hanold, who
has a sector perform rating on Cobalt shares and doesn''t own
any. The 50 percent stock price climb by the company earlier
today implied a possible 10 billion barrels gross in areas
offshore West Africa where Cobalt has properties, he said. </p>
<p>We''re talking about something that could rival all the
stuff that''s happening in Brazil, Hanold said. </p>
<p>It may be several years before production is under way off
Angola, Cobalt said on a conference call today. Cobalt has a 40
percent stake in Cameia-1 and the block where it was drilled. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs and private-equity firm Riverstone Holdings
LLC each hold 19 percent stakes in Cobalt, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s first-
quarter profit estimate was raised 21 percent at International
Strategy  Investment Group Inc. after an oil discovery near
Angola boosted the value of one of the firm''s investments. </p>
<p>Ed Najarian, an analyst at ISI, raised his earnings per
share estimate to $3.50 from $2.90, according to a research note
he distributed yesterday. Najarian cited the higher value of
Cobalt International Energy Inc. (CIE), a Houston-based deep-water oil
explorer whose stock surged 33 percent on Feb. 10 after it said
test results at an oil discovery off the coast of Angola were
better than expected. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, owns
19 percent of Cobalt through one of the firm''s private-equity
funds. Najarian estimates that 70 percent of the investment was
made with client money, with about 30 percent -- or about 6
percent of Cobalt -- owned by Goldman Sachs itself. At the
current price, Cobalt could provide Goldman Sachs with a $365
million private-equity gain, Najarian wrote. </p>
<p>Overall, we now estimate that private-equity and debt
gains should cause Goldman''s total investing and lending revenue
to jump to about $2 billion in the first quarter, Najarian
wrote. The gains probably won''t recur and the firm may fall
short of consensus earnings in subsequent quarters, Najarian
wrote, so he kept his hold recommendation on the stock. The
shares advanced 1.2 percent to $115.51 at 9:40 a.m. in New York. </p>

according to JPMorgan Asset Management. </p>
<p>The biggest gains will be in emerging-market equities where

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., Deutsche Bank
AG (DBK) and HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) are among at least seven firms facing a
Canadian probe into whether they participated in a conspiracy to
manipulate prices on interest-rate derivatives. </p>
<p>The nation''s Competition Bureau is investigating conduct by
the group -- also including Citigroup Inc. (C), Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc, ICAP Plc and RP Martin Holdings Ltd. --
between 2007 and 2010, according to documents it filed with the
Ontario Superior Court in May. Investigators are examining
whether firms conspired to affect prices on derivatives linked
to the Yen London interbank offered rate, according to the
documents, which were shown to Bloomberg News by court clerks. </p>
<p>Alexa Keating, a spokeswoman for the Competition Bureau,
said in an e-mailed statement that there is no conclusion of
wrongdoing at this time and no charges have been laid. </p>
<p>Canadian officials opened the case after a cooperating
party told the bureau that banks, at times facilitated by cash
brokers, agreed to make artificially high or low submissions for
the benchmark rate known as Yen Libor, according to the
documents, which described the informant as a bank involved with
the matter. </p>
<p>Regulators in the U.S., Europe and Asia are investigating
whether financial firms tried to manipulate benchmark interest
rates set by a survey of banks. The rates were used by investors
to gauge firms'' ability to borrow money at the height of 2008''s
credit crisis and can play a key role in prices on derivatives. </p>
<h2>Libor Surveys </h2>
<p>Libor rates are generated through a daily survey of firms
conducted on behalf of the British Bankers'' Association in
London. The lenders are asked how much it would cost them to
borrow from one another for 15 different periods, from overnight
to one year, in currencies including dollars, euros, yen and
Swiss francs. </p>
<p>Spokesmen for New York-based JPMorgan and Citigroup,
Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank, Edinburgh-based RBS and London-
based ICAP said they couldn''t immediately comment. </p>
<p>Diane Soucy Bergan, a spokeswoman for London-based HSBC in
Chicago, didn''t immediately respond to requests for comment. A
call after normal business hours to a U.K. phone number listed
on RP Martin''s website for media inquiries wasn''t answered, nor
was a call to a number listed for the broker''s New York office. </p>
<p>The bureau described the claims in an application for court
orders compelling the companies to provide records, such as e-
mails. The firms may have influenced derivatives trading on a
worldwide basis, including in Canada, it said. The court
granted the orders. </p>
<h2>Brokers, Traders </h2>
<p>An ICAP broker allegedly told a derivatives trader that he
would try to get London-based brokers to influence banks
participating in setting Yen Libor, according to the bureau. A
trader at HSBC also allegedly communicated with cash brokers,
instructing them to influence the benchmark rate, the bureau
said. Not all attempts to manipulate the rate were successful,
according to an affidavit filed by the bureau. </p>
<p>The Canadian officials said they were seeking lists of
individuals responsible for making Yen Libor submissions,
internal communications and records describing so-called Chinese
walls separating workers within the banks. </p>
<p>They sought a list of interest-rate derivative trades,
including records showing whether the banks made a profit or
loss on them. They also requested records showing the process
banks used to price interest-rate derivatives and how traders
were compensated. </p>
<p>The cooperating party told the bureau that by manipulating
the rate, the participant banks affected all interest-rate
derivatives that use Yen Libor as a basis for their price,
according to the court filing. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said a
proposed U.S. ban on banks'' proprietary trading and limits on
their investments in private equity and hedge funds may boost
financial-system risks the measure was designed to curtail. </p>
<p>Without substantial revisions, the proposed rule will
define permitted market making-related, underwriting and hedging
activities so narrowly that it will significantly limit our
ability to help our clients, John F.W. Rogers, the firm''s
chief of staff, said in one of two comment letters on proposed
Volcker rule restrictions. The rule would stifle Goldman''s
ability to help clients raise capital, manage their risks,
invest their wealth and generate liquidity, he wrote. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs joined its banking rivals, including JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM), Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS), in
registering complaints about the 298-page proposal released for
comment by U.S. regulators including the Federal Reserve and the
Securities and Exchange Commission ahead of yesterday''s public
comment deadline. Regulators, who sought input on more than
1,300 questions in their October proposal, now have until July
21 to complete and implement the rule. </p>
<p>Lawmakers included the rule, named for former Fed Chairman
Paul Volcker, in the Dodd-Frank Act to restrict risky trading by
banks that operate with federal guarantees. The Fed, SEC,
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency invited comment on how the measure would affect
market-making, liquidity, foreign institutions, and private
equity and hedge fund investments. </p>
<h2>Key Aims'' </h2>
<p>Although one of the key aims of Dodd-Frank was to promote
greater stability in financial markets, we are concerned that
the proposed rule could inadvertently increase systemic risk,
Rogers wrote. </p>
<p>If the rule makes hedging more expensive, banking
entities'' clients and customers will be forced to hold more risk
on their own books, he said. This will increase the
volatility of their earnings and hurt their share prices, which
in turn will raise their cost of capital, reduce their capacity
to invest, lower their returns to shareholders and diminish
their appeal as strategic partners. </p>
<p>Negative consequences could be far-ranging, with the
Volcker Rule putting U.S. firms at a competitive disadvantage to
their non-U.S. counterparts and imposing costs which do not
appear to have been sufficiently analyzed, he said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s Jeffrey Moslow, an investment banker to companies such as Tyco
International Ltd., plans to leave the firm. </p>
<p>Moslow, 47, a partner based in New York, is a former head
of the investment-banking services group and joined the firm in
1994, Goldman Sachs said today in an internal memorandum
disclosing the move. The memo was obtained by Bloomberg News and
confirmed by the company. </p>
<p>Moslow''s departure is the second by a partner in the
investment bank to be announced this week. Goldman Sachs, the
fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, said yesterday that George
Mattson, head of the industrials investment-banking group, plans
to leave. In the last year, Goldman Sachs has lost about 50
partners, the highest rank of employees who share in a special
compensation pool and are elected every two years. </p>
<p>Over the course of his career, Jeff played a significant
role in the development of our IBS strategy and has also helped
to recruit, mentor and develop many of our next generation of
coverage bankers, Richard Gnodde, David Solomon, and John S. Weinber, the co-heads of investment banking, said in the memo. </p>
<p>The investment banking services group, which Moslow ran or
co-ran from 2002 to 2008, was founded by former Goldman Sachs
Co-Chairman John Whitehead and consists of bankers focused on
covering specific clients rather than specializing in a
product such as stock underwriting or merger advice. </p>
<p>Moslow has been advising Nstar, the Boston-based utility,
on a planned sale to Northeast Utilities, and counseled defense
contractor Dyncorp International Inc. in its 2010 sale to
Cerberus Capital Management LP. </p>
<p>He is a graduate of Tufts University and Harvard Law
School, according to a profile on the Tufts website. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and
Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) sold a $200 million loan backing Apollo
Global Management LLC''s 2011 buyout of CKX Inc. (CKXE), the owner of
the television show American Idol, at the steepest discount
on record. </p>
<p>The first-lien credit was sold for 78 cents on the dollar,
according to three people familiar with the transaction, who
declined to be identified because the deal is private. That''s
the biggest so-called original issue discount for U.S. bank
debt, according to Standard  Poor''s Leveraged Commentary 
Data. </p>
<p>The loan sale allows the banks to reduce their exposure to
CKX after the company failed to sell $360 million in bonds in
July to pay for the $509 million buyout by Leon Black''s Apollo
after credit markets weakened due to Europe''s debt crisis. The
discount on New York-based CKX''s term loan follows a decline in
viewership of the company''s American Idol, according to
Michael Altberg, a credit analyst with SP in New York. </p>
<p>They''re heavily reliant on American Idol'', Altberg
said in a telephone interview. While the show might have more
near-term visibility, in five, six years from now there''s a lot
more risk around where that show will be. </p>
<p>The original issue discount on CKX''s first-lien loan is
about 20 cents below the average in January of 98.14 cents on
the dollar for loans rated B+/B, data from SP''s LCD show. The
OID reduces proceeds for borrowers and can cut underwriting
profits for banks while boosting yield for investors. </p>
<h2>Fewer Viewers </h2>
<p>American Idol, the most-watched series on U.S.
television, drew 17 percent fewer viewers for the debut of its
11th season last month than for its 2011 premiere. This year''s
show attracted 21.9 million viewers, News Corp. (NWS)''s Fox network
said in an e-mailed statement on Jan. 19, citing Nielsen data. </p>
<p>A high concentration of CKX''s earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization come from American Idol
and related revenue, according to a Jan. 18 report from Moody''s
Investors Service. </p>
<p>Moody''s lowered CKX''s ranking to B3, six levels below
investment grade, from B2 when CKX was taken private by Apollo
in June. Junk debt is rated less than Baa3 by Moody''s and below
BBB- by SP. </p>
<p>CKX, which owns rights to the name, image and likeness of
Elvis Presley and Muhammad Ali, had about $258 million of
revenue in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, according to Moody''s. </p>
<p>Results have been a little weaker than we had
anticipated, and their show Viva Elvis in Las Vegas is expected
to be canceled, Scott Van den Bosch, senior analyst at
Moody''s, said in a telephone interview. Those events have been
weighing on the company. </p>
<h2>Bridge Loan </h2>
<p>CKX''s bridge financing was replaced by a $200 million
first-lien loan due in 2017 and a $160 million second-lien
portion maturing in 2018. </p>
<p>The term loans do not amortize, which means there''s no
requirement to pay down these term loans over time, said SP''s
Altberg. So there is the risk of these bullet maturities 5 to
6 years from now. A so-called bullet maturity means the entire
principal amount is due in a lump sum payment when the debt
expires. </p>
<p>The company''s first-lien loan will pay interest at 9
percent, according to a fourth person with knowledge of the
matter, who also declined to be identified because the
transaction is private. The debt has 15 percent yield-to-
maturity, said three people. </p>
<p>Thomas Benson, chief financial officer at CKX, Tiffany Galvin, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, and Paula Chirhart, a
spokeswoman for Macquarie, declined to comment. </p>
<h2>Bondlike </h2>
<p>It''s a loan but it''s structured like a bond, Moody''s
Van den Bosch said. It''s fixed rate, there''s no amortization
payment, it''s covenant-lite and the incurrence test is the only
limitation that restricts additional debt from being issued. </p>
<p>Incurrence tests require the borrower to be in compliance
with certain financial ratios only when it is seeking a specific
action such as a dividend or acquisition. First-lien debt is
repaid first in a bankruptcy or liquidation. </p>
<p>CKX''s leverage is moderately high with debt to Ebitda
of 4.9 times, according to Moody''s, including lease expenses and
preferred shares treated as debt. The ratings company gave a B1
grade to CKX''s $200 million first-lien loan and Caa2 to its $160
million second-lien loan. </p>
<p>We think American Idol''s'' performance will be relatively
stable over the next few seasons, said SP''s Altberg. It''s
the longer term outlook that has less certainty. They have to
basically find new shows that are going to work that will help
to replenish their portfolio down the line. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) was left with almost
half the $982 million in TDC A/S (TDC) shares it tried to sell on
behalf of the Danish phone company''s private equity owners this
week, two people with direct knowledge of the transaction said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley holds about 59 million shares, or 7.2
percent of the company''s stock, TDC said in an announcement
today. Almost all of the bank''s stake was from shares left over
from the block sale after a 4 percent discount failed to lure
enough investors, said the people, who declined to be identified
because the deal was private. </p>
<p>In a block sale, the underwriter typically buys shares from
the selling shareholders before distributing them to investors,
rather than simply acting as a broker matching buyers and
sellers. Investment banks aim to profit by charging investors
more than what they paid for the shares. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley will clearly need to shift this off the
books, and the decision they''ll have to make is how long to tie
up capital for, or whether to sell it and take a loss, said
Christopher Wheeler, a banking analyst at Mediobanca SpA (MB) with a
neutral rating on the stock. There''s pressure to get
revenue, particularly in equity capital markets. </p>
<p>Brian Buckley, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley, declined to
comment. </p>
<h2>Second-Largest Shareholder </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley is now TDC''s second-largest shareholder,
surpassing Government of Singapore Investment Corporation Pte
Ltd., which had 5 percent of the shares at the end of 2011,
according to TDC''s annual report. The company''s largest
shareholder is still NTC Holding GP  Cie. SCA, the consortium
of TDC''s private equity owners, which controls about 43 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>We will treat Morgan Stanley the same way that we treat
all our shareholders, Dennis Callesen, a spokesman for TDC,
said by phone, declining to comment further on the sale. </p>
<p>NTC sold about 128 million shares at 43.40 kroner each in a
block sale that began Feb. 13, at the low end of the range,
people with knowledge of the transaction said yesterday. Morgan
Stanley was the sole bookrunner for the sale, according to terms
for the transaction obtained by Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>TDC shares fell 0.9 percent today to 42.90 kroner apiece,
after a 4.3 percent drop yesterday. The shares have fallen 6.9
percent this year, compared with an 8 percent increase for the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Morgan Stanley''s stake, valued at about
$455 million at the offer price, had fallen to about $445
million today. </p>
<p>The overhang will continue, David Aubert, analyst at
DNB Bank ASA in Oslo, said in a phone interview. Now that
Morgan Stanley has a large amount of shares, it adds to what NTC
holds. The overhang and the discount is something that is not
out of the shares just yet. </p>
<p>Aubert has a hold recommendation on TDC with a price
estimate of 47 kroner per share. </p>
<p>Risk-taking is still ingrained in the culture of
investment banking, said Giorgio Questa, a finance professor
at Cass Business School in London. Banks typically seek to sell
the shares they''re left with gradually on the markets to reduce
their exposure, said Questa, a former banker. </p>

<p>The wagers on the euro and the peso have returned 0.3

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan
Stanley (MS), the two Wall Street banks most reliant on trading,
warned U.S. regulators that a proposed ban on proprietary
trading could make the financial system more risky and curtail
services for clients. </p>
<p>The New York-based banks, along with competitors Bank of
America Corp., Citigroup Inc. (C) and JPMorgan Chase  Co., are
pushing to limit the reach of the Volcker rule, a ban on
proprietary trading included in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. A draft
of the rule, which takes effect in July, was released by U.S.
regulators in October. </p>
<p>Without substantial revisions, the proposed rule will
define permitted market making-related, underwriting and hedging
activities so narrowly that it will significantly limit our
ability to help our clients, John F.W. Rogers, Goldman Sach''s
chief of staff, said in a comment letter. </p>
<p>Although one of the key aims of Dodd-Frank was to promote
greater stability in financial markets, we are concerned that
the proposed rule could inadvertently increase systemic risk,
he added. If the rule makes hedging more expensive, banking
entities'' clients and customers will be forced to hold more risk
on their own books. </p>
<p>The Federal Reserve, Securities and Exchange Commission and
other financial regulators received thousands of comments
letters by the Feb. 13 deadline. A number of the world''s largest
banks questioned whether regulators took into account how they
conduct business. </p>
<h2>Real Misconception'' </h2>
<p>There appears to be a real misconception about how
principal market makers generate revenues, Colm Kelleher, who
runs Morgan Stanley''s trading business, and Chief Operating
Officer Jim Rosenthal, wrote in the firm''s comment letter. The
proposal should be revised to reflect the realities. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley generated about 44 percent of its revenue
last year from trading. In the letter, the bank officers argued
that the proposed rule fails to adequately distinguish between
permitted market making and prohibited proprietary trading, and
they objected to a provision requiring market makers to generate
most of their revenue from commissions, fees and bid-ask
spreads. </p>
<p>The proposed rule has a narrow view of market-making,
underwriting and hedging activities that is based on liquid
exchange-traded U.S. markets, Goldman Sachs''s Rogers said. The
rule doesn''t account for trading that is currently conducted in
less liquid or over-the-counter markets. </p>
<h2>Rigid Application'' </h2>
<p>The proposed rule''s rigid application of an agency-based,
exchange-traded equities paradigm threatens to reduce liquidity
in these markets, Rogers said. </p>
<p>The rule may hurt banks'' ability to underwrite corporate
bonds by restricting their ability to hold bonds as inventory
during a bond issuance, which could then increase costs for
issuers, according to the letter. </p>
<p>The two men responsible for the provision''s inclusion in
the Dodd-Frank Act -- Democratic Senators Carl Levin of Michigan
and Jeff Merkley of Oregon -- urged regulators to be more
forceful in implementing the rule. </p>
<p>The Volcker rule demands Wall Street change its
culture, Merkley and Levin wrote in their own comment letter. </p>
<p>The two senators insisted that the rule is not as
complicated as the banks maintain. </p>
<p>If a firm is holding onto a position in a way that
principally profits from price changes in the instrument and it
is being held for a period that indicates the holding was not a
long-term investment or the extension of credit, then that
should be considered prohibited proprietary trading, the
senators wrote. </p>
<h2>Conflicts of Interest </h2>
<p>Levin and Merkley also pushed for a more detailed account
of bank activities that may be banned by regulators as well as
an explicit ban on conflicts of interest. Levin has cited the
ban as a response to a Senate investigation he oversaw into the
financial crisis that faulted Goldman Sachs'' trading practices. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which accounted for 60 percent of its
revenue through trading in 2011, has already shuttered its
standalone proprietary trading desk. No matter how the final
version of the Volcker rule comes out, Rogers said Goldman Sachs
recognizes that Wall Street is in a time of change. </p>
<p>We are not arguing that the line between permitted
activities and prohibited proprietary trading be drawn in such a
way as to permit all activities in which we have historically
engaged, Rogers wrote. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., Deutsche Bank
AG (DBK) and HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) are among at least seven firms accused
by another bank of participating in a conspiracy to manipulate 
the price of derivatives worldwide for more than three years. </p>
<p>The unnamed bank, seeking immunity, told Canada''s
Competition Bureau that traders and cash brokers conspired to
influence the Yen London interbank offered rate from 2007 to
2010 to profit on interest-rate derivative positions linked to
the benchmark. The bureau spelled out the probe in documents it
filed with the Ontario Superior Court in May. </p>
<p>The documents, shown yesterday to Bloomberg News by court
clerks, offer one of the most detailed accounts yet as watchdogs
in Europe, Asia and the U.S. look into concerns that firms
conspired to manipulate interest rates serving as benchmarks for
trillions of dollars of financial products. Canada also is
investigating Citigroup Inc. (C), Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS),
ICAP Plc (IAP) and RP Martin Holdings Ltd., the court documents show. </p>
<p>There is no conclusion of wrongdoing at this time and no
charges have been laid, Alexa Keating, a spokeswoman for the
Competition Bureau, said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Libor rates are generated through a daily survey of firms
conducted on behalf of the British Bankers'' Association in
London. The lenders are asked how much it would cost them to
borrow from one another for 15 different periods, from overnight
to one year, in currencies including dollars, euros, yen and
Swiss francs. </p>
<h2>Communications Among Firms </h2>
<p>Canadian officials, who were seeking records from the
companies, said the cooperator claimed that the banks'' employees
agreed to make artificially high or low submissions for Yen
Libor to improve the outcomes of trades tied to the rate.
According to the documents, banks communicated with one another
and with cash brokers to form agreements. In some cases,
derivatives traders allegedly asked cash brokers to help
influence submissions for Yen Libor. </p>
<p>Spokesmen for New York-based JPMorgan and Citigroup,
Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank (DBK), Edinburgh-based RBS and London-
based ICAP declined to comment. </p>
<p>Diane Soucy Bergan, a spokeswoman for London-based HSBC in
Chicago, didn''t respond to requests for comment. A call after
normal business hours to a U.K. phone number listed on RP
Martin''s website for media inquiries wasn''t answered, nor was a
call to a number listed for the broker''s New York office. </p>
<h2>Documents Sought </h2>
<p>An ICAP broker was accused of telling a derivatives trader
that he would try to get London-based brokers to influence banks
participating in setting Yen Libor, according to the bureau. A
trader at HSBC also allegedly communicated with cash brokers,
instructing them to influence the benchmark rate, the bureau
said. Not all attempts to manipulate the rate were successful,
according to an affidavit filed by the bureau. </p>
<p>ICAP is the world''s largest broker of transactions between
banks. </p>
<p>The Canadian officials said they were seeking lists of
people responsible for making Yen Libor submissions, internal
communications and records describing so-called Chinese walls
separating workers within the banks. </p>
<p>They sought a list of interest-rate derivative trades,
including records showing whether the banks made a profit or
loss on them. They also requested records showing the process
banks used to price interest-rate derivatives and how traders
were compensated. </p>
<p>The bureau said it became aware of the case when it was
approached by the bank seeking to take advantage of an immunity
program. A lawyer for the company told the bureau that by
manipulating the rate, participating banks affected all
interest-rate derivatives that use Yen Libor as a basis for
their price, according to the court filing. </p>

<p>Stephen Roach, Morgan Stanley''s
former chairman for Asia and chief economist, is retiring from
the firm to focus on scholarly pursuits. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer James Gorman announced the
departure of Roach, the non-executive chairman for Asia since
2010, in a memo to employees today. Roach has taught at Yale
University and plans to go into academia full-time, according to
the memo. </p>
<p>The 66-year-old economist, who joined New York-based Morgan
Stanley in 1982, has predicted China will overtake the U.S. as
the dominant economy by 2025. Roach said in a Bloomberg
Television interview last week that the U.S. must stop blaming
China for its problems and focus on creating economic growth
through exports. </p>
<p>Steve will no doubt continue to animate the scholarly
discourse, particularly as it relates to the economies of
Asia, Gorman wrote in the memo. During his career, he has
been recognized as one of Wall Street''s most influential thought
leaders. </p>
<p>Roach plans to write a book on the tensions in the U.S.-
China economic relationship, he said today in an interview on 
Bloomberg Radio''s The Hays Advantage with Kathleen Hays. The 
Morgan Stanley (MS) economics group he helped build will continue to 
address the major themes shaping the global outlook, Roach said. </p>
<h2>Shelf Life </h2>
<p>It''s easy to stay with the trend and make these very
short-term trading calls, but I''d like to say that the legacy
I''ve left is a team that really looks out into the medium- to
longer-term to make calls that have long shelf lives and really
can drive broad macro trends in the world and the markets, he
said today. </p>
<p>In 2007, Roach said the U.S. economy would stagnate because
of an impending housing slump that would erode consumer
spending. He said last month that the U.S. needs to have more
active debates about the exit strategy for the monetary and
fiscal stimulus provided during the credit crisis, and said
leaders need to learn humility from the experience. </p>
<p>As I look to the United States, I think to this day,
there''s a glaring absence of truly being able to fathom the
mistakes that were made either on Wall Street, Washington, or
Main Street, heading into the great crisis of 2008 and 2009,
Roach said in a Bloomberg Radio interview last month. So
humility is not something that we''ve been able to fully grasp at
this point, I''m sorry to say. </p>
<p>Europe will likely remain in a recession for the bulk of
this year, Roach said last month. He said he doesn''t think the
Euro will break apart, even as Greece probably should exit
the group. </p>
<p>Before joining Morgan Stanley, Roach worked at Morgan
Guaranty Trust Company and on the research staff of the Federal
Reserve Board in Washington. Roach has a Ph.D. in economics from
New York University. </p>

<p>UBS AG (UBSN), Switzerland''s biggest bank,
sought immunity from prosecution by Canadian regulators probing
a potential conspiracy to rig the price of derivatives globally,
three people with knowledge of the inquiry said. </p>
<p>The lender is the cooperating party referred to by Canada''s
Competition Bureau in court papers filed by the regulator with
the Ontario Superior Court in May, said the people, who declined
to be identified because the identity of the firm hasn''t been
made public. </p>
<p>The papers, shown this week to Bloomberg News by court
clerks, indicate a bank told the regulator that traders and cash
brokers conspired to influence the Yen London interbank offered
rate from 2007 to 2010 to profit on interest-rate derivatives
linked to the benchmark. Regulators worldwide are investigating
whether banks attempted to manipulate the London, Tokyo and euro
interbank offered rates, known as Libor, Tibor and Euribor. </p>
<p>UBS has also suspended a number of employees including Yvan
Ducrot, co-head of rates, and Holger Seger, global head of
short-term interest rates trading, as part of an investigation
of its rate submissions, said a person briefed on the matter who
declined to be identified because the decision is private. </p>
<p>The bank has already been given conditional immunity by the
Swiss Competition Commission as part of an investigation into
suspected manipulation of the Yen Libor, Tibor and Swiss franc
Libor rates. The Zurich-based lender was granted similar
immunity by the U.S. Department of Justice last year as part of
its probes of Yen Libor and Euroyen Tibor rates. </p>
<p>Dominik von Arx, a spokesman for UBS in London, declined to
comment on the court case. Alexa Keating, a spokeswoman for the
Competition Bureau, declined to comment on the identity of the
cooperating party. </p>
<p>There is no conclusion of wrongdoing at this time and no
charges have been laid, Keating said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Neither Ducrot nor Seger were reachable through their
office telephone numbers and neither responded to e-mails
through LinkedIn. A profile under Seger''s name says he oversees
70 traders worldwide. The Financial Times reported the
suspensions earlier today. Von Arx declined to comment on the
report. </p>
<p>According to the affidavit filed by the bureau, Canadian
officials were informed that HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA), JPMorgan Chase 
Co., Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc, ICAP Plc (IAP) and RP Martin Holdings Ltd. took part in the
scheme. Employees at the banks agreed to make artificially high
or low submissions for Yen Libor to improve the outcomes of
trades tied to the rate, the Canadian regulator said, citing
information it received under the immunity program. </p>
<p>The documents also describe similar communications
involving traders at other banks. For instance, Peter O''Leary, a
trader at HSBC, allegedly instructed cash brokers on how to
influence the benchmark rate, the bureau said. It also described
communications involving London-based traders Guillaume Adolph
at Deutsche Bank, Stuart Wiley at JPMorgan and Brent Davies at
RBS, as well as former RBS employee Will Hall and former
JPMorgan employee Paul Glands. The bureau hasn''t brought claims
against any of them. </p>
<p>Wiley and Glands declined to comment. Davies didn''t return
calls to his mobile phone. There was no response to an e-mail
sent to an address found for O''Leary. Contact information for
Adolph and Hall couldn''t be located through directory assistance
and in an Internet search. </p>
<p>Spokesmen for New York-based JPMorgan and Citigroup,
Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank, Edinburgh-based RBS and London-
based ICAP have declined to comment on the affidavit. A
spokeswoman for London-based HSBC didn''t respond to requests for
comment. </p>
<p>Tavistock Communications, which handles media inquiries for
RP Martin, issued a statement saying, RP Martin has received
requests from certain regulators to provide information on a
voluntary basis to assist them with their preliminary inquiries
but no formal allegations have been made against RP Martin by
any regulator. </p>

<h2>Goldman Sachs Analyst Inquiry Said to Show U.S. Focus on Taiwan </h2>
<p>The investigation of a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) analyst
shows U.S. officials have intensified their focus on banks and
Taiwan in a multiyear insider-trading probe that has implicated
hedge funds, technology company employees and consultants, a
person familiar with the matter said. </p>
<p>The investigation of Henry King, the Goldman Sachs analyst
covering Taiwan, shows federal authorities are expanding the
insider-trading probe by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in
Manhattan and the FBI in New York, said the person, who didn''t
want to be identified because the matter isn''t public. </p>
<p>The probe, called operation Perfect Hedge, began five
years ago and has resulted in insider-trading and securities
fraud charges being filed against 64 people, with more than 50
since 2009 either pleading guilty or being convicted at trial.
They included Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam, who
is serving an 11-year prison term. </p>
<p>James Margolin, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of
Investigation in New York, declined to comment on the case, or
whether King is cooperating. King didn''t answer calls to his
Hong Kong office number yesterday. E-mails to his company
account received an auto reply saying he''s out of the country on
a personal matter. </p>
<p>Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to
comment on the investigation of King, or whether he remains a
bank employee or is on leave. Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for
Bharara, declined to comment. </p>
<p>King, based in Hong Kong, covers Taiwanese companies
including Quanta Computer Inc. and Compal Electronics Inc., the
world''s two largest manufacturers of notebook computers for
clients including Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) and Dell Inc. (DELL), according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>King, who joined Goldman Sachs in 2002, was named head of
Taiwan research in 2005. Prior to New York-based Goldman Sachs,
he worked at Credit Suisse First Boston and Indosuez W.I. Carr
Securities Ltd. </p>
<p>Bharara''s office in October indicted Rajat Gupta, a former
Goldman Sachs and Procter  Gamble Co. director, with leaking
material, nonpublic information to Rajaratnam about the two
companies. Gupta has denied wrongdoing. </p>
<p>Prosecutors said in a Feb. 3 letter to U.S. District Judge
Jed Rakoff, who is presiding over Gupta''s case in Manhattan,
that they had witness statements that there was a second
insider at Goldman Sachs who leaked tips to Rajaratnam that
did not relate to Goldman and/or Procter  Gamble. </p>
<p>Prosecutors didn''t disclose which stocks the second unnamed
tipper, who Rakoff called Mr. X, had allegedly disclosed to
Rajaratnam. </p>
<p>Gupta''s lawyer, Gary Naftalis, declined to comment about
King, or other Goldman Sachs sources Rajaratnam may have had for
illegal tips. Naftalis has argued in court that he should be
permitted to use such information while defending Gupta at
trial. </p>

<h2>New Suits </h2>
<h2>Olympus Former Chairman and Six Others Arrested Over Fraud </h2>
<p>Three former executives at Olympus Corp. (7733), including ex-
chairman Tsuyoshi Kikukawa, and four others were arrested for
suspected violation of Japan''s Financial Instruments and
Exchange Act. </p>
<p>The camera maker is facing shareholder lawsuits and may be
subject to further criminal investigation after admitting to a
13-year cover-up. The company restated past securities reports
and took a $1.3 billion reduction in net assets in December. </p>
<p>Olympus''s Tokyo headquarters and its affiliated offices
were raided in December by prosecutors after the company said
Kikukawa and two others colluded to hide investment losses from
the 1990s. The stock has plunged 49 percent since the Oct. 14
dismissal of its first non-Japanese president, Michael Woodford,
who later publicly questioned inflated takeover costs. </p>
<p>Kikukawa, 70, who headed Olympus for 10 years until last
year, Hideo Yamada, 67, who led the investment unit since the
1980s and later became an auditing officer, and former Executive
Vice President Hisashi Mori concealed losses, booked overstated
goodwill and falsified financial statements, the prosecutors
said in a statement. </p>
<p>The prosecutors also arrested Akio Nakagawa, cited in a
December panel report as having aided Olympus in structuring its
loss-hiding schemes. Nobumasa Yokoo, who was also named in the
report, Taku Hada and Hiroshi Ono, were arrested by the Tokyo
Metropolitan Police, according to the statement. </p>
<p>We take the situation seriously, Yoshiaki Yamada, a
spokesman for Olympus, said by phone yesterday. We will
cooperate fully with investigators. </p>
<p>At a press conference in London this morning, former
president Woodford said, while the arrests were encouraging,
there are still many important issues which are not covered by
today''s announcement. He called for further investigation into
the role of banks and accounting firms in the fraud, and said
three directors at the company -- Masataka Suzuki, Kazuhiro
Watanabe and Shinichi Nishigaki -- should be replaced. </p>
<p>Olympus sued 19 current and former executives, including
current President Shuichi Takayama and five corporate auditors,
in January over their roles in concealing losses. The company
formed panels to reform management and nominate a new board. </p>

<h2>UBS Claims Two Ex-Advisers Took Customer Data to Wells Fargo </h2>
<p>A UBS AG brokerage unit sued two former financial advisers
in Chicago, claiming they took confidential trade secret
information including customer account data to competitor Wells
Fargo (WFC) Advisers LLC. </p>
<p>Named as defendants in the lawsuit filed yesterday by UBS
Financial Services Inc. are David Kinnear and Kathleen Bakas,
who allegedly resigned two days ago to join the Wells Fargo 
Co. unit. One full-time and one part-time UBS employee, all part
of Kinnear''s wealth-management group, went with them, according
to the complaint. </p>
<p>Led by Kinnear, the team serviced accounts that generated
more than $3.7 million in revenues for UBS over the past 12
months of the defendants'' employment, UBS alleged. </p>
<p>The New York-based brokerage unit of Zurich-based UBS seeks
a court order blocking the defendants and any Wells Fargo
representative from soliciting any UBS client Kinnear or Bakas
had advised while there, preventing the disclosure of any
proprietary UBS information and directing its return. </p>
<p>UBS also seeks expedited arbitration of its claims through
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. </p>
<p>Ancel Martinez, a spokesman for San Francisco-based Wells
Fargo, which isn''t a party to the suit, couldn''t immediately
comment on the case. Kinnear and Bakas didn''t immediately
respond to e-mail messages seeking comment on the lawsuit. </p>
<p>The case is UBS Financial Services Inc. v. Kinnear,
12CH05333, Cook County, Illinois, Circuit Court, Chancery
Division (Chicago). </p>
<h2>Deutsche Bank Sued Over $512 Million in Mortgage Securities </h2>
<p>Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)''s Ace Securities was sued in New York
state court for fraud for allegedly misrepresenting the quality
of $512 million worth of residential mortgage-backed securities
by Phoenix Light SF Ltd. </p>
<p>Phoenix Light, which bought and later sold the securities,
is seeking at least $300 million in damages, according to a
summons filed yesterday. It accuses Ace Securities of making
material misrepresentations and omissions regarding
underwriting standards used to issue the mortgage loans that
were pooled together into the offerings, according to court
filings. </p>
<p>Ace Securities knew about problems with the mortgages
underlying the securities because of reports they received from
mortgage-review firm Clayton Holdings, yet still included them
in the offerings that were sold to the plaintiffs, according to
Phoenix Light. </p>
<p>The securities have performed worse than expected due to
the poorer-quality collateral, and defendants'' wrongdoing has
led directly to plaintiffs'' damages, which include loss of
market value on the securities, Phoenix Light said in the
filing. Plaintiffs have lost the entire value of certain of
the securities. </p>
<p>Duncan King, a New York spokesman for Frankfurt-based
Deutsche Bank, said in a phone interview that the claims had no
merit and the company would fight the suit. </p>
<p>The case is Phoenix Light SF Ltd. v. Ace Securities Corp.,
650422/2012, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan). </p>
<h2>Syncora Guarantee Sues EMC Over Mortgage-Backed Securities </h2>
<p>Syncora (SYCRF) Guarantee Inc. sued JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s EMC
Mortgage unit over mortgage-backed securities, alleging fraud
and breach of contract in a lawsuit filed in New York state
court. </p>
<p>The suit was brought in connection with a transaction known
as SACO I Trust 2006-1, which involved the securitization of
residential mortgage loans with an aggregate principal balance
of more than $310 million, Syncora said in the complaint. That
transaction served as collateral for the issuance of about $303
million in securities. </p>
<p>EMC Mortgage was a unit of Bear Stearns Cos. until the
investment bank was bought by JPMorgan in 2008. Bear Stearns and
EMC obtained a financial-guaranty insurance policy from New
York-based bond insurer Syncora to enhance the marketability
of the securities and their return on the transaction,
according to the lawsuit. </p>
<p>Bear Stearns made materially false and misleading
representations to induce Syncora to insure the transaction,
and didn''t conduct extensive due diligence as it had
promised, lawyers for the bond insurer said in the lawsuit. </p>
<p>The transaction had experienced cumulative losses of $96.7
million as of Sept. 30, which has resulted in Syncora making
more than $51.9 million in claim payments, the complaint says. </p>
<p>Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan Chase, declined to comment on the lawsuit in an e-mail. </p>
<p>The case is Syncora Guarantee Inc. v. EMC Mortgage LLC,
650420/2012, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan.) </p>
<h2>Ex-Aluminium Bahrain Executive Charged by U.K. With Corruption </h2>
<p>U.K. prosecutors charged Bruce Allan Hall with corruption
and money laundering tied to his time as an executive at
Aluminium Bahrain B.S.C., a smelting company in Bahrain. </p>
<p>An Australian national, Hall was released on conditional
bail and must appear at a London criminal court next month, the
Serious Fraud Office said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. He
is accused of accepting bribes over an eight-year period while
he worked at the company, known as Alba, the prosecutors said. </p>
<p>Hall was extradited from Australia to London to face the
charges, the SFO said. His co-defendant in the case, British
investor Victor Dahdaleh, is also scheduled to appear at the
same court hearing, the SFO said. </p>
<p>Dahdaleh was charged Oct. 24 with six counts of making
corrupt payments, two counts of money laundering, and one charge
of conspiracy to corrupt. He is accused of paying bribes to Alba
officials to win contracts for Alcoa Inc. (AA), the largest U.S.
aluminum producer. </p>
<p>Efforts to reach Hall or an attorney representing him were
unsuccessful. A call to the SFO wasn''t immediately returned. </p>
<h2>Taleo Sued by Shareholder Over $1.9 Billion Oracle Offer </h2>
<p>Taleo Corp. (TLEO) was sued by an investor claiming the human-
resources software company failed to get the best price in its
planned $1.9 billion acquisition by Oracle Corp. (ORCL) </p>
<p>Hillary Coyne contends Taleo directors are duty-bound to
maximize shareholder value in such a sale, and violated that
duty by agreeing to the $46 per-share buyout, according to a
complaint filed Feb. 14 in Delaware Chancery Court in
Wilmington. </p>
<p>The offer does not account for Taleo''s expected future
growth, and particularly its July 2011 acquisition of
JobPartners, which significantly expanded the company''s presence
in Europe, Coyne''s lawyers said in court papers. </p>
<p>Oracle, based in Redwood City, California, said Feb. 9 it
would buy Taleo in part to expand so-called cloud computing,
which provides software, storage and other services from remote
data centers. </p>
<p>Caroline Japic, a spokeswoman for Dublin, California-based
Taleo, declined to comment on the lawsuit. </p>
<p>The case is Coyne v. Taleo, CA7245, Delaware Chancery Court
(Wilmington). </p>

<h2>Lawsuits/Pretrial </h2>
<h2>BofA Seeks to Change Venue on $8.5 Billion Mortgage Deal </h2>
<p>Bank of America Corp. and a group of investors that reached
an $8.5 billion mortgage-bond settlement with the bank are
seeking to overturn a ruling that kept the deal before a federal
judge for review. </p>
<p>Bank of America, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, and
the investor group, which includes BlackRock Inc. (BLK), have said the
settlement over Countrywide Financial Corp. mortgage bonds
should be considered by a state court in New York, where it was
first filed last year for approval. </p>
<p>This case does not belong in federal court at all,
Charles Rothfeld, a lawyer for Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK),
which is seeking approval of the settlement, said at a hearing
yesterday before the U.S. Appeals Court in Manhattan. </p>
<p>The accord would resolve claims from investors about
defective Countrywide mortgages underlying their securities. The
deal has the support of the investors that negotiated it,
including BlackRock and Pacific Investment Management Co.
American International Group Inc. (AIG) and others are opposed or have
demanded more information to evaluate it. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan in October
ruled that the settlement should be considered in federal court
for approval because it implicates core federal interests in
the integrity of nationally chartered banks and the vitality of
the national securities markets. </p>
<p>Bank of America, the investor group and Bank of New York,
the trustee for the mortgage securitization trusts, are asking
the appeals court to overturn Pauley''s ruling. Under the federal
Class Action Fairness Act, it should be returned to state court,
they said in court papers. </p>
<p>Entities under the name Walnut Place, which own Countrywide
mortgage bonds, said the case should remain in federal court.
Bank of New York is trying to obtain approval for one of the
largest class-action settlements in history without providing
adequate protection for investors, Walnut Place said. </p>
<p>The case is Bank of New York Mellon v. Walnut Place LLC,
11-cv-05988, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>
<h2>Macy''s Says Martha Stewart Living Is Holding It Hostage'' </h2>
<p>Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. (MSO) is essentially
holding Macy''s hostage by saying that its pact with the
department-store chain expires in January 2013, Macy''s Inc. (M) said
in court papers in their contract dispute. </p>
<p>Macy''s sued in January to stop New York-based Martha
Stewart Living from executing an agreement to sell merchandise
in J.C. Penney Co. stores. Macy''s, based in Cincinnati, said it
has the exclusive right to sell Martha Stewart-branded products
in certain categories. </p>
<p>Martha Stewart Living fired back last week, accusing Macy''s
of breach of contract and saying that the retailer has stocked
and priced Martha Stewart products in a manner that favors
Macy''s own private-label brands. Martha Stewart Living also said
Macy''s couldn''t have exercised a five-year renewal option on the
deal between the two companies because of the breach. </p>
<p>The uncertainty created by MSLO''s breach has put Macy''s
in an inequitable and untenable position, Macy''s said in
papers filed Feb. 14 in New York state Supreme Court. If the
agreement were to actually expire in January 2013, Macy''s would
have to immediately begin seeking to replace and wind down the
Martha Stewart product line at Macy''s. </p>
<p>Jeanne Meyer, a spokeswoman for Martha Stewart Living, said
the company stands behind earlier statements and what has been
said in court filings. </p>
<p>The case is Macy''s Inc. v. Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia
Inc., 650197/2012, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan). </p>
<h2>JPMorgan, Lehman Trade Data on Bank''s $6 Billion Claim </h2>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ),
after getting a judge''s approval yesterday to settle a $699
million dispute, are trading documents in a fight over a sum
that''s almost 10 times larger, according to a court filing. </p>
<p>The biggest U.S. bank, which lent $70 billion to Lehman''s
brokerage around the time of the 2008 bankruptcy, says it is
still owed $6.3 billion by the defunct firm and its brokerage.
Lehman, which termed the claim significantly overstated,
agreed that certain shared documents and information should be
treated confidentially, according to yesterday''s filing in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. </p>
<p>The fight relates to JPMorgan''s role as a go-between for
the Lehman brokerage''s repurchase agreements with short-term
investors after the parent''s bankruptcy. Lehman said last year
that JPMorgan failed to sell collateral securing the loans in a
commercially reasonable manner. JPMorgan said it generated
more than $18 billion of cash from the sale of collateral in
some of the most difficult markets in modern times, benefiting
Lehman. </p>
<p>Separately, New York-based JPMorgan is fighting a lawsuit
by Lehman that alleges the lender helped cause its 2008 collapse
by demanding $8.6 billion in collateral. The settlement approved
yesterday, which means that JPMorgan will return $699 million of
the collateral to Lehman, doesn''t affect the bank''s other claims
against the defunct firm, a lawyer for JPMorgan told the judge
yesterday. </p>
<p>JPMorgan sued Lehman back after the $8.6 billion suit,
alleging Lehman defrauded its lender into making the loan. It
has asked the judge to dismiss Lehman''s suit. </p>
<p>Lehman filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history in
2008, listing $613 billion in debt. </p>
<p>The main case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
08-13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). The lawsuit is Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 10-03266, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<h2>Trials/Appeals </h2>
<h2>Stanford Helped Support Antiguan Banking Reforms, Witness Says </h2>
<p>R. Allen Stanford underwrote expenses for a blue-ribbon
panel to clean up Antigua''s offshore banking sector in 1999,
a lawyer who served on that commission testified. </p>
<p>Antigua was getting blasted for lax regulation and poor
cooperation with international anti-money-laundering efforts,
which threatened island banks'' ability to do business with U.S.
banks, Patrick O''Brien, a former U.S. Customs Service agent,
said yesterday at Stanford''s criminal fraud trial. </p>
<p>If the Federal Reserve won''t do business with your
country, you''re out of business, he told the jury. Allen
Stanford wanted it to be the crown jewel of the Caribbean. </p>
<p>O''Brien said he and Stanford personally seized the records
of all Antiguan offshore banks over the protests of Althea
Crick, the island''s top regulator. They loaded the records into
Stanford''s truck and put them under guard in a Stanford facility
so the commission could do its job, he said. </p>
<p>Ms. Crick was an obstructionist; we couldn''t get the
records; we couldn''t get things done, O''Brien testified. We
were basically stonewalled. The only one who could authorize
access was Ms. Crick and she wouldn''t. </p>
<p>Jurors previously heard Crick testify that Stanford tried
to take control of Antigua''s banking regulatory agency through a
combination of threats and charm. </p>
<p>Prosecutors have told jurors that Stanford bribed Crick''s
successor, Leroy King, with satchels of cash and Super Bowl
tickets to shield Antigua-based Stanford International Bank Ltd.
from scrutiny by island and international regulators. </p>
<p>Stanford is accused of defrauding investors of more than $7
billion through a Ponzi scheme built on bogus certificates of
deposit at that bank. </p>
<p>O''Brien is the first defense witness in Stanford''s trial,
which is in its fourth week in federal court in Houston. After
he retired from the customs service, O''Brien worked for
Greenberg Traurig LLP (1153L), a law firm that represented Stanford''s
businesses. He said he did a little bit of work for Stanford
before the financier asked him to join the Antiguan banking
reform commission. </p>
<p>Stanford, 61, denies all wrongdoing. He has been in prison
since being indicted in June 2009 and faces as long as 20 years
in prison if convicted of the most serious charges against him. </p>
<p>The criminal case is U.S. v. Stanford, 09-cr-342, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston). The SEC
case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Stanford
International Bank, 09-cv-298, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of Texas (Dallas). </p>
<h2>Ex-News Corp. Phone Hacker Approved for Supreme Court Appeal </h2>
<p>The ex-News Corp. (NWSA) private detective who was jailed in 2007
for intercepting mobile-phone voice mails won permission to
appeal to the U.K. Supreme Court in a dispute over giving
incriminating evidence in civil cases against him. </p>
<p>Glenn Mulcaire, 41, won the court''s approval yesterday in
London, according to his lawyer Sarah Webb. The private eye, who
hacked into phone messages for News Corp.''s News of the World
tabloid, was re-arrested last year as part of a new police probe
involving hundreds of newly identified victims. The appeal
relates to parallel civil lawsuits filed by victims. </p>
<p>It''s clearly a very important matter of law which the
Supreme Court have decided they should rule on, Webb, of Payne
Hicks Beach in London, said in a phone interview. A two-day
hearing scheduled to start May 9 could affect how British courts
deal with self-incrimination in lawsuits, she said. </p>
<p>Mulcaire and Clive Goodman, a reporter for the News of the
World, pleaded guilty and were jailed for as long as six months
in 2007 for intercepting phone messages for members of Prince Charles''s staff and five other public figures. Police opened a
new probe a year ago after celebrities'' civil lawsuits revealed
evidence of thousands more potential victims and the involvement
of more News Corp. journalists. </p>
<p>Mulcaire, whose phone-hacking notes were seized by police
in 2006, has been named in many of the claims filed against News
Corp.''s U.K. newspaper unit since the scandal erupted again in
2010. The appeal stems from lawsuits by actor Steve Coogan and
Nicola Phillips, a former employee of celebrity publicist Max
Clifford, whose voice mails were intercepted. </p>
<p>The Court of Appeal on Feb. 1 upheld a ruling that Mulcaire
must disclose who at the tabloid told him to intercept messages
left for Coogan and Phillips, what information was collected and
to whom he gave it. Mulcaire''s lawyers argued that by doing so
he would incriminate himself if he''s charged in the new police
probe. While Coogan has since settled his case, Phillips hasn''t
and the ruling could affect future cases. </p>
<p>In a separate phone-hacking suit filed by the Welsh pop
star Charlotte Church, scheduled for a trial starting Feb. 27,
Mulcaire''s lawyers are seeking to block the press from reporting
on evidence about the private detective''s activities that could
potentially undermine him in a criminal case. </p>

<h2>Verdicts/Settlements </h2>
<h2>Citigroup Mortgage Unit to Pay $158.3 Million in Settlement </h2>
<p>Citigroup Inc. (C)''s CitiMortgage unit agreed to pay $158.3
million to settle claims tied to its actions in a federal home-
loan insurance program, the Manhattan U.S. Attorney''s office
said. </p>
<p>The U.S. settled a lawsuit against the Citigroup unit that
alleged more than six years of misconduct in connection with the
Federal Housing Administration Direct Endorsement Program, the
U.S. Attorney''s office said yesterday in a statement. In the
settlement, CitiMortgage admitted to falsely stating that some
loans were eligible for mortgage insurance through the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development, according to the
statement. </p>
<p>For far too long, lenders treated HUD''s insurance of
their mortgages like they were playing with house money,
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in the statement.
In fact, they were playing with other people''s money and other
people''s homes. </p>
<p>Five banks including Citigroup settled with 49 states on
Feb. 9 to end a probe into abusive foreclosure practices, with
Citigroup agreeing to pay as much as $2.2 billion. </p>
<p>We are pleased to resolve this matter in conjunction with
the National Mortgage Settlement reached last week among the
five largest mortgage servicers and the Department of Justice
and state attorneys general, Mark Rodgers, a spokesman for New
York-based Citigroup, said in an e-mailed statement. As with
the larger mortgage agreement, we have fully provided for this
settlement as of the fourth quarter of 2011. </p>
<p>The case is  U.S. ex rel. Hunt v. Citigroup Inc., 11-
cv-005473, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>

<h2>Fortis, Former Executives Held Liable for Damages in Court </h2>
<p>Fortis, now known as Ageas (AGS), and its former executives Jean-
Paul Votron and Gilbert Mittler misled investors about the
bank''s ability to meet capital requirements for more than a
month in 2008 and are liable for damages, a court ruled. </p>
<p>How much Ageas, Votron and Mittler must pay will be
determined in separate proceedings, the district court in the
Dutch city of Utrecht said in a ruling yesterday. Maurice
Lippens, the former chairman of Fortis, can''t be held personally
liable for misleading investors, according to the ruling. </p>
<p>The verdict is the first court victory for investors who
lost money in the collapse of Fortis, once Belgium''s largest
financial-services company. Fortis''s market value dropped by
8.21 billion euros ($10.8 billion) in the period when the court
said investors were being misled, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It lost an additional 5.39 billion euros on June 26,
2008, when Fortis said it would scrap an interim dividend and
announced a share sale. </p>
<p>Ageas regrets this judgment and will lodge an appeal
against it with a view to protecting the interests of its
stakeholders, the insurer, based in Brussels and Utrecht, said
yesterday in a statement. </p>
<p>Fortis will cover any damages its former top executives are
found liable for, according to their 2008 termination
agreements. Ageas is contesting those commitments in a lawsuit
Votron, Mittler and Lippens filed before the Utrecht court,
Greet Poulmans, a spokeswoman for Ageas, said by telephone from
Brussels. </p>
<h2>Pentagon Capital Must Pay SEC $76.8 Million for Abusive Trading </h2>
<p>Pentagon Capital Management Plc, a closed U.K. hedge fund,
was told by a judge to pay $76.8 million in a lawsuit filed in
2008 by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over
allegedly abusive mutual fund trading. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet in Manhattan ruled Feb. 14
that the SEC proved its claim in a 17-day trial last year that
the hedge fund and its chief executive officer, Lewis Chester,
engaged in a fraudulent scheme by making mutual fund trades
after the 4 p.m. close of markets in New York. </p>
<p>The defendants intentionally, and egregiously, violated
the federal securities laws through a scheme of late trading,
Sweet wrote in the Feb. 14 decision. This scheme was broad-
ranging over the course of several years and in no sense
isolated. </p>
<p>Sweet ruled that Pentagon Capital and Chester must disgorge
$38.4 million in improper profits on the trades. He imposed the
same amount as an additional civil penalty. </p>
<p>We are extremely disappointed by the judgment and intend
to appeal, Frank Razzano, a lawyer for the defendants, said in
a telephone interview. </p>
<p>Sweet ruled against the SEC''s claim that Pentagon Capital
committed fraud by making deceptive, rapid-fire transactions
known as market-timed trades. </p>
<p>Pentagon Capital said in 2008 that it was closing and
returning investors'' money because of the SEC investigation and
civil suit. </p>
<p>The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Pentagon
Capital Management Plc, 08-cv-3324, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<h2>Litigation Departments </h2>
<h2>Ex-Juror Says She Lied to Be More Marketable'' in Tax Case </h2>
<p>A juror who helped convict four defendants in a 10-year tax
shelter scheme said she lied about her background to make
herself more marketable to serve on the panel. </p>
<p>Catherine Conrad, who was Juror No. 1 in the trial of Paul
Daugerdas, a former lawyer at the defunct law firm Jenkens 
Gilchrist, and three others, testified in a hearing in Manhattan
federal court yesterday that she failed to disclose that she''s
an alcoholic and a suspended attorney with numerous arrests for
crimes including shoplifting and driving under the influence of
alcohol. </p>
<p>Daugerdas and the other defendants convicted in May at the
end of a 10-week trial have asked U.S. District Judge William
Pauley to order a new trial based on Conrad''s lies and omissions
about her past during jury selection. Pauley ordered her
arrested this morning after she telephoned a judge''s clerk in
Manhattan federal court to say she wasn''t going to obey a court
subpoena requiring her to testify yesterday. </p>
<p>I know I served and I know I did my civic duty, Conrad
told Pauley near the end of her testimony yesterday. I know my
disclosures would definitely not have allowed me to serve as a
juror. </p>
<p>Pauley is holding a two-day hearing to determine whether to
throw out the convictions and order a new trial. Conrad was
granted immunity for her testimony yesterday, after invoking her
constitutional right not to incriminate herself. Pauley released
Conrad at the end of 3 1/2 hours on the stand. </p>
<p>Jurors convicted Daugerdas on more than 20 criminal counts,
including conspiracy, multiple counts of tax evasion and
attempting to impede the Internal Revenue Service. He faces more
than 20 years in prison. </p>
<p>The defendants claim Conrad wouldn''t have been permitted to
serve on the jury if she''d told the truth about her background.
Her presence on the panel deprived them of a fair trial, they
said. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Daugerdas, 09-CR-581, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) failed to persuade
a federal judge to bar the U.S. and Alaskan governments from
pursuing further damage claims related to the 1989 Exxon Valdez
oil spill. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge H. Russel Holland in Anchorage
yesterday refused Exxon''s request to enforce a 1991 agreement,
under which the Irving, Texas-based company paid $900 million to
settle claims over damage to the environment. </p>
<p>Exxon presently suffers no particular harm, Holland
wrote in the order. Its business is not in any fashion
disrupted or impeded because of the uncertainty of a claim by
the governments. </p>
<p>The Exxon Valdez tanker ran aground in 1989, dumping 11
million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound. Exxon agreed
in 2009 to pay $470 million in interest on a $507.5 million
judgment won by local victims of the spill, including fishermen
and small businesses. That was in addition to the $900 million
civil settlement. </p>
<p>The civil settlement contains a reopener clause that allows
governments to pursue additional damages. </p>
<p>The possibility of a reopener claim has been on the
table'' since the consent decree was finalized, Holland wrote. </p>
<p>Oil from the spill is still trapped between layers of sand
on the Alaskan shoreline, according to a study published in
Nature Geoscience in 2010. </p>
<p>The case is United States of America v. Exxon Corp. 3:91-

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), trying to attract
younger Internet users, is bolstering its MSN site with a
service that produces short news synopses based on popular
topics on search and social-media sites such as Twitter Inc. </p>
<p>Called msnNOW, the product scans Twitter, Facebook Inc.,
BreakingNews.com and Microsoft''s own Bing search engine every
five minutes. MSN''s staff then create 100-word articles on the
news and post them with related video, news and social-media
posts. Besides a Web version, msnNOW will have be available on
Facebook and mobile devices, MSN General Manager Bob Visse said. </p>
<p>Web portals such as MSN, Yahoo! Inc. and AOL Inc. have
struggled to hold on to younger users, who increasingly get
their news from social networks. Microsoft is trying to appeal
to more people age 25 to 40 by making it easier to view
information on the day''s hot topics from multiple sources. MSN
typically attracts older customers and more casual Internet
users, rather than information junkies, Visse said. </p>
<p>We skew a little bit older and a little bit lighter usage
than we''d like, he said. </p>
<p>Besides leaning heavily on social-networking sources to win
over younger users, msnNOW also is looking to delve into
edgier topics, Visse said. A demonstration of the product
this week featured a piece on butt cleavage. </p>
<p>The feature won''t have advertisements at first, though
Microsoft will add them in the future, he said. In subsequent
versions, the Redmond, Washington-based company also may be able
to respond to users'' behavior by tailoring topics and stories to
their tastes, Visse said. </p>
<p>For us to grow in the demographic we want, we have to
show something quite different, he said. </p>

<p>Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive
officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) since 2006, may step down as
early as the U.S. summer, Fortune Magazine reported today,
citing an unnamed executive at the firm. </p>
<p>Gary Cohn, president and chief operating officer, is the
board''s top candidate to replace Blankfein, according to the
report. Blankfein''s departure isn''t certain, Fortune wrote.
David Wells, a spokesman for the New York-based firm, declined

<p>Goldman Sachs''s 2011 earnings dropped 47 percent to the
lowest level since 2008 on a second consecutive annual decline
in fixed-income trading revenue. Blankfein has sought to repair
the firm''s reputation after the Securities and Exchange

<p>A probe of a JPMorgan Chase  Co.
account that received almost $1.8 billion in inflows of cash in
the month before MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ)''s bankruptcy showed no
evidence that brokerage customers'' money was being siphoned off,
a trustee said. </p>
<p>Louis Freeh, who is handling the parent company''s
bankruptcy, said all transactions between the MF Global Inc.
brokerage customer account and the JPMorgan account, held by the
parent company''s finance affiliate, related to margin loans. The
affiliate lent money to brokerage customers to cover margin
requirements and was later repaid, he said in a report. </p>
<p>Freeh said he started the probe, which included review of
volumes of bank statements and an extensive population of cash-
transaction activity during October 2011, after U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn in Manhattan asked if any cash in
the account belonged to brokerage customers, as some customers
had alleged. His findings indicate that at the JPMorgan account
money flowed from the parent''s affiliate to the brokerage, and
not the reverse. </p>
<p>After an investigation, the trustee does not believe that
any of the cash in the JPM account as of the petition date
represents misdirected customer property, Freeh said in the
report filed yesterday in bankruptcy court in Manhattan. </p>
<h2>Account Activity </h2>
<p>Even the account activity from Oct. 26-28, when a shortfall
began in MF Global''s segregated customer accounts, showed no
misdirected customer cash moving to the account at JPMorgan, he
said. In those two days, $322 million flowed into the finance
unit''s account and $773 million flowed out, of which $697
million was sent to the brokerage, Free said. </p>
<p>MF Global Holdings (MFGLQ), formerly run by ex-Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) co-chairman Jon Corzine, filed the eighth-largest U.S.
bankruptcy on Oct. 31, listing debt of almost $40 billion. </p>
<p>MF Global is using money in the account, which had a
balance of $25.3 million on Oct. 28, while it is in bankruptcy.
The account had about $21 million as of Jan. 31, according to a
monthly operating report filed yesterday. </p>
<p>Customers of the failed brokerage had said the money may
have been part of the $1.2 billion believed at the time to be
missing from their segregated accounts. The brokerage trustee,
James Giddens, has since traced most of the missing money, which
had been added to other sums he hasn''t immediately been able to
recover. He currently estimates the gap between customer claims
and funds available to pay them at $1.6 billion. </p>
<p>Freeh is handling the parent company''s bankruptcy in a
separate court proceeding. </p>
<p>The brokerage case is Securities Investor Protection Corp.
v. MF Global Inc., 11-cv-02790, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). The parent''s bankruptcy case

<p>General Mills Inc. (GIS), the maker of

<p>Morgan Stanley increased its use of
historical cost accounting for corporate loan commitments,
joining Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) in moving away from the mark-
to-market approach the firms had earlier used. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley raised the amount of loans and lending
commitments that it accounted for as held for investment, or
HFI, to $9.7 billion in the fourth quarter from $800 million a
year earlier. Goldman Sachs decided to make the change to some
of its corporate loan book, the Wall Street Journal reported
yesterday, citing people familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>Both New York-based firms had losses on relationship
lending last year and face differing treatment from regulators
between HFI and fair-value commitments. Fair-value accounting
often requires firms to book losses on the commitments, even if
they aren''t tapped by the borrowers, while commercial bank
competitors avoid mark-to-market declines by holding the
commitments at historical cost. </p>
<p>We are still fanatical believers in mark-to-market,
Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said on a
conference call with analysts last month. Substantially all of
our assets today are mark-to-market. Our risk is managed on a
mark-to-market basis. And whatever we conclude on what I''ll call
a very small portion of assets, just relationship lending, those
statements will still be true. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) had about $400 million of losses in the
third quarter from corporate lending, the majority of which is
unfunded commitments. Goldman Sachs had $1 billion in unrealized
losses related to relationship lending for 2011. Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to comment on
whether the firm made a decision on the accounting treatment. </p>
<h2>Onerous'' Treatment </h2>
<p>Consideration of the change was also being driven by more
onerous capital treatment of mark-to-market commitments
compared to similar HFI assets, Viniar said. Fair-value loans
were penalized substantially more than HFI loans, in the
Federal Reserve''s annual review of banks'' capital plans, Morgan
Stanley CFO Ruth Porat said last month. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley is working to increase lending as it gains
more deposits through buying Citigroup''s remaining stake in the
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney brokerage, which had $110.6 billion
in deposits as of Dec. 31. Total corporate loans and commitments
rose to $82.9 billion at the end of 2011 from $69.1 billion a
year earlier. </p>
<p>Fundamentally, we are a mark-to-market shop, Porat said
last month. As it relates to the loan book, we obviously have
a bank. We''re the fifteenth-largest U.S. depository by deposits,
and so we''re always considering what makes sense in terms of
capital and funding efficiency. </p>
<p>Commercial banks helped fight off a proposal last year from
the Financial Accounting Standards Board that sought to make
them mark loans to market. The panel sets U.S. accounting
standards. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs told Norwalk, Connecticut-based FASB during
the comment period for that proposal that banks hide losses on
loans used to generate investment-banking fees and should be
required to report the loans at fair value. </p>

<p>Walter Schloss, the money manager
who earned accolades from Warren Buffett for the steady returns
he achieved by applying lessons learned directly from the father
of value investing, Benjamin Graham, has died. He was 95. </p>
<p>He died on Feb. 19 at his home in Manhattan, according to
his son, Edwin. The cause was leukemia. </p>
<p>From 1955 to 2002, by Schloss''s estimate, his investments
returned 16 percent annually on average after fees, compared
with 10 percent for the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index. (SPX) His firm,
Walter J. Schloss Associates, became a partnership, Walter 
Edwin Schloss Associates, when his son joined him in 1973.
Schloss retired in 2002. </p>
<p>Buffett, a Graham disciple whose stewardship of Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. has made him one of the world''s richest men and
most emulated investors, called Schloss a superinvestor in a
1984 speech at Columbia Business School. He again saluted
Schloss as one of the good guys of Wall Street in his 2006
letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. </p>
<p>Walter Schloss was a very close friend for 61 years,
Buffett (BRK/A) said yesterday in a statement. He had an extraordinary
investment record, but even more important, he set an example
for integrity in investment management. Walter never made a dime
off of his investors unless they themselves made significant
money. He charged no fixed fee at all and merely shared in their
profits. His fiduciary sense was every bit the equal of his
investment skills. </p>
<h2>Began as Runner'' </h2>
<p>To Buffett, Schloss''s record disproved the theory of an
efficient market -- one that, at any given moment, assigns a
reasonably accurate price to a stock. If companies weren''t
routinely overvalued and undervalued, Buffett reasoned, long-term results like Schloss''s couldn''t be achieved, except through
inside information. </p>
<p>Schloss, who never attended college, began working on Wall
Street in 1935 as a securities-delivery runner at Carl M.
Loeb  Co. He said Armand Erpf, the partner in charge of the
statistical department, recommended that he read Security
Analysis by Graham and David Dodd, published a year earlier.
The book became a classic in the field. The firm then paid for
Schloss to take two courses with Graham sponsored by the New
York Stock Exchange Institute. </p>
<p>Schloss stayed in touch with Graham while serving four
years in the U.S. Army during World War II, then went to work
for Graham before striking out on his own. </p>
<p>The Schloss theory of investing, passed from father to son,
involved minimal contact with analysts and company management
and maximum scrutiny of financial statements, with particular
attention to footnotes. </p>
<h2>Focus on Statements </h2>
<p>The Schlosses would rather trust their own analysis and
their longstanding commitment to buying cheap stocks, Bruce
Greenwald, Judd Kahn, Paul Sonkin and Michael van Biema wrote in
Value Investing: From Graham to Buffett and Beyond, their
2001 book. </p>
<p>This approach, the authors wrote, leads them to focus
almost exclusively on the published financial statements that
public firms must produce each quarter. They start by looking at
the balance sheet. Can they buy the company for less than the
value of the assets, net of all debt? If so, the stock is a
candidate for purchase. </p>
<p>An example was copper company Asarco Inc. The Schlosses
bought shares in 1999 as the stock bottomed out around $13. In
November of that year, Grupo Mexico SA (GMEXICOB) bought Asarco for $2.25
billion in cash and assumed debt, paying almost $30 a share. </p>
<h2>Guts to Buy'' </h2>
<p>Basically we like to buy stocks which we feel are
undervalued, and then we have to have the guts to buy more when
they go down, Schloss said at a 1998 conference sponsored by
Grant''s Interest Rate Observer. And that''s really the history
of Ben Graham. </p>
<p>Buffett, in his 2006 letter to shareholders, said Schloss
took no real risk, defined as permanent loss of capital and
invested in about 1,000 securities, mostly of a lackluster
type. A few big winners did not account for his success. </p>
<p>Edwin Schloss, now retired, said yesterday in an interview
that his father''s investing philosophy and longevity were
probably related. </p>
<p>A lot of money managers today worry about quarterly
comparisons in earnings, he said. They''re up biting their
fingernails until 5 in the morning. My dad never worried about
quarterly comparisons. He slept well. </p>
<p>Walter Jerome Schloss was born on Aug. 28, 1916, in New
York City, the son of Jerome H. Schloss and the former Evelyn
Gomprecht, according to a paid notice in the New York Times. He
attended the Franklin School in Manhattan, now part of the
Dwight School. </p>
<h2>Early Lessons </h2>
<p>Schloss learned lessons about earning and saving from his
father, whose radio factory warehouse burned down before a
single unit was sold, and from his mother, who lost her family
inheritance in the 1929 market crash, Alice Schroeder wrote in
her 2009 book, The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business
of Life. </p>
<p>He enlisted in the Army on Dec. 8, 1941, the day after
Japan''s surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, and rose to the rank of
second lieutenant. He served in Iran as part of the Signal
Corps, then moved to the Pentagon in Washington to complete his
tours of duty. </p>
<p>During this period, he stayed in touch with Graham, who was
looking for a securities analyst just as Schloss was finishing
up his wartime service. Schloss joined Graham-Newman in 1946. </p>
<p>Schloss first met Buffett at an annual meeting of
wholesaler Marshall Wells, which drew both investors because it
was trading at a discount to net working capital, according to a
2008 article in Forbes magazine. When Buffett joined Graham-Newman, he and Schloss shared an office. </p>
<p>While Buffett became a star inside the firm, Schloss was
pigeonholed as a journeyman employee who would never rise to
partnership, Schroeder, a Bloomberg News columnist, wrote in
her book. </p>
<p>Schloss left Graham-Newman in 1955 and, with $100,000 from

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) plans to
increase its first sale of Samurai bonds in more than four years
to at least 75 billion yen ($943 million) from an original
target of 50 billion yen, according to a person with direct
knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>The brokerage will offer at least 70 billion yen of five-
year notes priced to yield 205 basis points more than the yen
swap rate, the person said, asking not to be identified because
the details are private. Goldman also intends to sell at least 5
billion yen of five-year, floating-rate notes at 220 basis
points more than the three-month London interbank offered rate
for yen, said the person. The bonds could price as soon as
tomorrow, the person said. </p>
<p>New York-based Goldman Sachs delayed the sale last week
after Moody''s Investors Service placed it under review for
downgrade, another person familiar with the matter said at the
time. The bank last sold Samurai bonds in January 2008, when it
raised 148.5 billion yen, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>
<p>I thought the spreads would be tighter than this,
Yoshihiro Nakatani, a Tokyo-based senior fund manager at Asahi
Life Asset Management Co., said in a phone interview today.
The five-year maturity of the fixed-rate bonds is a
disadvantage for investors, given their price volatility. </p>
<h2>Record Start </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs initially marketed the fixed-rate notes to
yield 170 basis points to 195 basis points more than the yen
swap rate before price guidance was raised to a 195 basis point
to 210 basis point spread, the person said on Feb. 17. </p>
<p>Hiroko Matsumoto, a spokeswoman at Goldman Sachs in Tokyo,
declined to comment on the sale when contacted by telephone
today. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs'' sale would make 2012 the busiest start to
the year on record for yen-denominated notes issued by overseas
companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd. (CCL), Australia''s
biggest soft-drink maker, posted a 54 percent rise in second-
half profit as a one-time gain from selling its beer unit to
SABMiller Plc (SAB) outweighed the effect of stalling domestic demand. </p>
<p>Net income rose to A$438.2 million ($467 million) in the
six months ended Dec. 31 from A$284.6 million a year earlier.
Second-half figures were calculated by subtracting first-half
earnings from the A$591.8 million full-year profit the Sydney-
based company reported today. </p>
<p>Cooler summer weather in Australia''s eastern states
combined with stalling consumer spending to crimp sales in the
company''s biggest market. The result was helped by a A$170.3
million gain from the sale of Coca-Cola Amatil''s stake in the
Pacific Beverages beer business to SABMiller, and it may
exercise an option to buy spirit assets from the London-based
brewer. </p>
<p>Considering the weather it''s a pretty consistent
performance, David Cooke, an analyst at Nomura Holdings Ltd.
in Sydney, said by phone yesterday. A quality company like
this should be able to deliver high single-digit or low double-
digit earnings growth. </p>
<p>The full-year profit of A$591.8 million beat the A$573
million average of nine analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Excluding items, profit for 2011 rose 5 percent to A$532
million, it said. </p>
<h2>Most Challenging </h2>
<p>The past 12 months were undoubtedly the most challenging
year the business has faced in over a decade, Chief Executive
Officer Terry Davis said in the statement. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Amatil shares fell 0.3 percent to A$12.08 at
12:02 p.m. in Sydney. The benchmark SP/ASX 200 index declined
0.2 percent. </p>
<p>The company agreed in December to sell its stake in the
Pacific Beverages beer venture for A$305 million to clear the
way for SABMiller to complete its A$10.5 billion acquisition of
Foster''s Group Ltd. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Amatil said it expects to spend as much as A$200
million by the middle of this year if it exercises a related
option to buy Foster''s spirits and pre-mixed drinks business
from SABMiller. It would aim to return to the local beer
business as soon as a two-year exclusion period under its
agreement with SABMiller lapses. </p>
<p>While in the short term we may not be able to compete in
beer in Australia, we are not restricted in our other markets,
Davis said. </p>
<h2>Australian Slowdown </h2>
<p>Annual earnings before interest and tax from Australian
beverages rose 2.4 percent from a year earlier to A$607.2
million as the cooler weather curbed demand before Christmas.
The pace of growth slowed from 7.3 percent in 2010. </p>
<p>Indonesia  Papua New Guinea profit jumped 18 percent to
A$88.1 million while earnings from New Zealand  Fiji slipped
2.3 percent to A$80 million. Earnings from the Alcohol, Food 
Services unit fell 1.2 percent to A$93.2 million. </p>
<p>One-time items added A$59.8 million to annual profit, with
the gain from the Pacific Beverages sale partially offset by
A$110.5 million in restructuring costs in its food business as
it fired employees and wrote down the value of inventory. </p>

<p>Walter Energy Inc. (WLT), the U.S. mining
company that paid C$5.3 billion ($5.3 billion) for Western Coal
Corp. in April, posted fourth-quarter earnings that missed
analysts'' estimates after metallurgical-coal prices fell. </p>
<p>Net income dropped 8.8 percent to $83.8 million, or $1.34 a
share, from $91.9 million, or $1.72, a year earlier, Birmingham,
Alabama-based Walter said today in a statement. The average
estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for profit of
$1.50 a share. </p>
<p>Sales of metallurgical coal, which is used in steelmaking,
rose 60 percent to 2.4 million tons. The average selling price
for hard coking coal was $244 a metric ton. The company''s so-
called average cash cost of production climbed to $131.74 a ton
from $91.14. </p>
<p>Average realized pricing was a little lower than we were
looking for and average costs were a little higher, Jim Rollyson, a Houston-based analyst with Raymond James Financial
Inc., said in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>Walter reiterated its guidance of 11.5 million to 13
million tons of coal production in 2012. It sold 8.7 million

<p>A former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
computer programmer was freed after his conviction for stealing
the bank''s high-speed trading code was reversed by a U.S.
appeals court. </p>
<p>Wearing a gray sweatsuit, white tennis shoes and a huge
grin, Sergey Aleynikov, 42, left the Manhattan courthouse where
he had been convicted in December 2010 and entered a waiting car
with his lawyer, Kevin Marino. </p>
<p>Justice occasionally works, Aleynikov told reporters as
he left. This was such big news to me I haven''t had any time
to think about what would happen. </p>
<p>Aleynikov, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Russia, said
he hoped to be with his three daughters, ages 8, 6 and 3. Until
Feb. 17, he had been serving an eight-year sentence at the
federal prison in Fort Dix, New Jersey. </p>
<p>After hearing oral arguments from both prosecutors and
Marino on Feb. 16, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Manhattan issued
a one-page order vacating Aleynikov''s convictions for economic
espionage and the interstate transportation of stolen property.
The appeals court said it would issue an opinion explaining the
ruling later. </p>
<p>The appeals court also issued a mandate that would have
foreclosed any further challenge to its decision. The office of
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara persuaded the court to set
aside the mandate so it can argue for a rehearing of the appeal,
either before a three-judge panel or all the court''s available
judges. Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for Bharara''s office,
declined to comment on the ruling. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Denise Cote, who presided over the
trial, ordered Aleynikov released from prison Feb. 17. </p>
<p>Aleynikov was convicted by a jury of violating the Economic
Espionage Act and the Interstate Transportation of Stolen
Property Act. He was sentenced last March. </p>
<p>On his last day of work at New York-based Goldman Sachs in
June 2009, Aleynikov uploaded hundreds of thousands of lines of
source code from the firm''s high-frequency trading system,
prosecutors said. </p>
<p>He circumvented Goldman Sachs''s security, sent the code to
a server in Germany, compressed and encrypted it, and took it
with him to a meeting with new employers in Chicago, the U.S.
said. Prosecutors argued Aleynikov wanted it as a cheat
sheet to start a trading system at his new job. </p>
<p>During oral arguments on Feb. 16, the three-judge appeals
panel criticized the government''s application of the espionage
act to Aleynikov''s actions, asking the prosecutor how the crime
occurred and how it affected commerce. </p>
<p>The judges -- Dennis Jacobs, 67, Guido Calabresi, 79, and
Rosemary Pooler, 73 -- also asked if taking Goldman Sachs''s
trading code was comparable to taking copyrighted material or
bringing an employee manual to a new job. </p>

Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<h2>Trials/Appeals </h2>
<h2>Stanford CFO Allegedly Forged Boss''s Name, Refused Reforms </h2>
<p>R. Allen Stanford was furious to learn that his finance
chief, James Davis, forged his name to a 2007 employee memo
abolishing a department Stanford created to reel in
expenses, a former executive testified. </p>
<p>He called me at home at 11 or 12 one evening, and he was
very mad, Linda Wingfield, Stanford''s former executive
director of special projects, told jurors Feb. 17 at Stanford''s
criminal fraud trial in federal court in Houston. He said he
did not sign it. </p>
<p>Wingfield, who held a number of executive positions at
Stanford''s companies over 10 years, testified that Davis refused
to give the boss access to a corporate computer system with
Stanford Financial Group Co.''s financial records. Testifying as
a defense witness, she said Davis also ignored or circumvented
policies Stanford instituted to clamp down on expenditures. </p>
<p>He fought us from day one, a department set up by the
chairman to try to control costs, Wingfield said of Davis.
Mr. Davis was always refusing. </p>
<p>Wingfield''s testimony may bolster Stanford''s claim that it
was Davis, not he, who ran the financial services empire and
engineered a fraud that cost investors more than $7 billion.
Davis pleaded guilty and testified as a government witness
earlier in the trial. </p>
<p>Prosecutors accuse Stanford of stealing more than $2
billion from certificates of deposit at his Antigua-based
Stanford International Bank Ltd. Instead of holding investor
funds in safe assets as he promised, Stanford used their money
to fund an extravagant lifestyle and risky ventures including
Caribbean airlines, real estate projects and cricket
tournaments, prosecutors say. </p>
<p>Stanford, 61, has been jailed as a flight risk since being
indicted in June 2009. If convicted of the most serious charges,
he faces as long as 20 years in prison. </p>
<p>Wingfield, who also ran some of Stanford''s side ventures,
testified Feb. 17 via a video link from federal court in
Orlando, Florida. She said she was too ill to travel. </p>
<p>Robert Scardino, Stanford''s lawyer, asked Wingfield who
controlled all the financial issues, including the treasury,
accounting, internal audits and investments at Stanford''s
companies. </p>
<p>Mr. Davis -- and the insurance, too, she said. There
was nobody else who handled all the books. </p>
<p>Wingfield told jurors she believed Stanford''s court-
appointed receiver duplicated efforts and wasted money during
the chaotic period after the businesses were seized by the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in February 2009. </p>
<p>More than 40 Stanford investors crowded into the courtroom
Feb.17 to mark the third anniversary of the SEC crackdown. Angie
Shaw, leader of the Stanford Victims'' Coalition, said the
group''s motto is 3 and $0, meaning three years and zero
recovery by defrauded investors. </p>
<p>The criminal case is U.S. v. Stanford, 09-cr-342, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston). The SEC
case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Stanford
International Bank, 09-cv-298, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of Texas (Dallas). </p>

<h2>Commerzbank Defends Bonus Cut After Bank Fell Off Cliff'' </h2>
<p>Commerzbank AG (CBK) didn''t act dishonestly in going back on a
promise to pay bankers from a guaranteed bonus pool, the German
lender''s attorney said in a London trial over payments to
Dresdner Kleinwort staff. </p>
<p>Commerzbank, which took over Dresdner in 2009 and cut
bonuses by 90 percent or more, is defending a lawsuit brought by
104 Dresdner bankers who want individual payouts of as much as 2
million euros ($2.7 million). </p>
<p>Stefan Jentzsch, Dresdner''s former chief executive officer,
had promised at a 2008 company meeting to set aside 400 million
euros for discretionary pay. Dresdner''s record loss that year
justified changing the policy and Jentzsch''s pledge wasn''t
legally binding, Commerzbank lawyer Thomas Linden said. </p>
<p>It may be perfectly honorable to withdraw from a non-
binding commitment in circumstances when the business has fallen
off a cliff, Linden told the judge in closing arguments
yesterday. Every banker, we say, in the U.K. knows that until
you have a document which sets out the award, you don''t have an
entitlement. </p>
<p>European banks face pressure from governments and
regulators over pay. Executives at Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) and
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc should have to give up bonuses
so individuals aren''t rewarded for failure, the U.K. Treasury
said, while European financial services chief Michel Barnier has
called for new curbs on excessive compensation. </p>
<p>The case comes at a time when the words banker''s bonus''
are perhaps not the most popular in the English language,
Andrew Hochhauser, a lawyer representing some of the Dresdner
claimants, said in his closing arguments. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, the 2008 bonus pool promise had been agreed
with then-owners Allianz SE (ALV) in consultation with the U.K.
Financial Services Authority as a way to stop staff leaving
Dresdner, he said. </p>
<h2>Vermont Attorney General Appeals Ruling on Yankee Nuclear Plant </h2>
<p>The state of Vermont filed an appeal of a federal court
ruling allowing Entergy Corp. (ETR) to keep its Vermont Yankee nuclear
power plant open. </p>
<p>William Sorrell, the state''s attorney general, said a Jan.
19 ruling by U.S. District Judge Garvan Murtha improperly
limits the state''s role in deciding whether the nuclear power
plant stays open past March 21. The appeal was filed Feb. 17. </p>
<p>Murtha said in his ruling last month that Vermont lacked
the authority to deny Entergy a license to operate the reactor
after March. </p>
<p>Entergy sued Sorrell, Vermont Governor Peter Shumlin and
members of its Public Service Board in April 2011. Entergy
claimed that the state didn''t have the authority to overrule the
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which renewed Entergy''s
license to operate the power station until 2032. </p>
<p>The company has said in court papers that Vermont Yankee,
the state''s only nuclear power plant, supplies about 33 percent
of Vermont''s electricity. It pays about $13 million a year in
state fees and taxes. The plant is in Vernon, on the Connecticut
River in the southeastern corner of the state. </p>
<p>New Orleans-based Entergy is the second-largest operator of
U.S. nuclear plants. </p>
<p>The case is Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee v. Shumlin,
1:11-00099, U.S. District Court, District of Vermont
(Brattleboro). </p>
<p>The appeal will be heard by the Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit in New York. </p>
<h2>New York Can Enforce Ban Against Use of Schools for Worship </h2>
<p>New York City can enforce a ban on the use of public
schools for worship services, a U.S. appeals court said,
restricting a judge''s temporary halt on the ban to only the
group that brought the lawsuit. </p>
<p>The district court''s finding that Bronx Household has
shown likelihood of success on the merits of its case does not
justify enjoining the board from enforcing its order against
non-parties, the appellate court in Manhattan said Feb. 17. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska on Feb. 16 granted a 10-
day temporary order blocking the city''s ban. The Bronx Household
of Faith had sought the order to allow its members to continue
meeting in a New York City public school on Sundays, in
contravention of an order that went into effect Feb. 13. </p>
<p>Last year, the appellate court, overturning Preska''s 2007
decision in favor of the church, ruled that the city may
prohibit religious groups from using school facilities outside
of regular school hours for religious worship services. </p>
<p>The legal battle dates to 1995, when the Bronx Household of
Faith, an evangelical Christian church, sued the city. The
church argued the city was violating the First Amendment by
denying it use of a school while allowing other community groups
access to campuses for their activities. </p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court in December refused to consider the
appeals court''s ruling reversing Preska''s decision. Lawyers for
the church returned to argue before Preska that the city''s ban
violates the First Amendment''s free exercise clause, which
forbids government interference in religious activities. </p>
<p>Jordan Lorence, a lawyer with the Alliance Defense Fund in
Washington who represents the Bronx Household of Faith, said in
a phone interview the appeals court''s order didn''t deal with the
merits of the case. </p>
<p>It''s somewhat disappointing but it''s not a major
ruling, Lorence said. </p>
<p>The case is The Bronx Household of Faith v. Board of
Education of the City of New York, 01-cv-08598, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<h2>Verdicts/Settlements </h2>
<h2>Ex-SanDisk Employee Pleads Guilty in Kinnucan Insider Case </h2>
<p>Former SanDisk Corp. (SNDK) executive Donald Barnetson pleaded
guilty to participating in a securities fraud scheme with John
Kinnucan, an expert networking consultant who was also charged. </p>
<p>Barnetson, 37, pleaded guilty in federal court in Manhattan
Feb. 17 to one count of conspiracy to commit securities and wire
fraud. He faces as long as five years in prison and was ordered
released on $50,000 bond. </p>
<p>I conspired with a consultant to provide confidential
information with regard to my employer at the time, SanDisk
Corp., Barnetson told U.S. Magistrate Judge Gabriel Gorenstein
in the hearing. </p>
<p>Barnetson, a former senior director of original equipment
manufacture strategy for SanDisk, passed tips to Kinnucan who
shared them with his clients, which included hedge funds and
money managers, according to Barnetson''s plea agreement with the
government. </p>
<p>Prosecutors claim Barnetson tipped Kinnucan in July 2010
about SanDisk''s anticipated revenue, which wasn''t public. In
September 2010, he told Kinnucan about confidential negotiations
about a legal dispute between SanDisk and Apple Inc., according
to the complaint. </p>
<p>Kinnucan paid Barnetson with a $25,000 investment in a
business he was starting, as well as meals at expensive
restaurants and food deliveries, according to the Kinnucan
complaint. Kinnucan also gave Barnetson inside information about
other companies, according to prosecutors. </p>
<p>Kinnucan, 54, the Broadband Research LLC founder who said
he refused to secretly record a money manager in a nationwide
U.S. probe of insider trading, was charged with one count of
conspiracy to commit securities fraud, one count of conspiracy
to commit wire fraud and two counts of securities fraud in the
complaint unsealed Feb. 17 in federal court in New York. </p>
<p>He was arrested at his home in Portland, Oregon, Feb. 16
the Federal Bureau of Investigation said. Elizabeth Steele, an
FBI spokeswoman in Portland, said Kinnucan was in the Multnomah
County Jail. </p>
<p>Lee Flanagin, a spokesman for Milpitas, California-based
SanDisk, said Barnetson left the company in early 2011. </p>
<p>The criminal case is U.S. v. Kinnucan, 12-mj-00424, and the
civil case is SEC v. Kinnucan, 12-cv-01230, U.S. District Court,

<h2>SEC Submits Revised Koss Settlement After Earlier Rejection </h2>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission submitted a
revised settlement of a lawsuit against stereo headphone maker
Koss Corp. (KOSS) and its chief executive officer after a judge
rejected an earlier one as too vague. </p>
<p>The SEC sued Milwaukee-based Koss in October, claiming it
had filed materially inaccurate financial statements from
2005 to 2009. The agency said the failure of Michael J. Koss,
who was CEO and chief financial officer, to supervise his
accounting staff enabled another executive to embezzle $30
million. </p>
<p>The SEC on Feb. 16 submitted a new settlement to U.S.
District Judge Rudolph T. Randa in Milwaukee after his rejection
of a prior one in December. As in the earlier one, the new
agreement requires the CEO to forfeit $450,000 and 160,000
options and to cooperate with the SEC. Neither the company nor
the Koss will admit or deny the SEC''s claims. </p>
<p>There was no substantive difference between the two
settlements, SEC lawyer Andrea Wood said Friday in a telephone
interview. </p>
<p>After rejecting the earlier proposal, Randa in December
asked the SEC to explain how it calculated the amount that Koss
would pay. SEC lawyers said the sum was equal to bonuses and
incentive pay that he received for the fiscal years 2008 and
2009 and part of 2010. </p>
<p>Randa said on Feb. 1 that the SEC''s response largely
satisfied his concerns. </p>
<p>Alan Berkeley, a partner in Pittsburgh-based KL Gates LLP (1142L)
who is representing the company and the CEO, didn''t immediately
respond to a voice-mail message seeking comment on the revised

<h2>MOEX Agrees to Pay $90 Million to Settle U.S. Spill Claims </h2>
<p>Mitsui  Co. (8031)''s MOEX Offshore 2007 LLC will pay $90 million
to the U.S. and five states for violating the Clean Water Act in
the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, according to court filings. </p>
<p>The U.S. filed a consent order in federal court Feb. 17
outlining the settlement. The agreement requires MOEX to pay $45
million in civil penalties to the U.S. and about $25 million
total to Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas,
court papers show. MOEX will also pay $20 million for land
acquisition projects, the U.S. said. </p>
<p>MOEX held a 10 percent share of BP Plc (BP/)''s Macondo well,
which blew up in April 2010, setting off the largest offshore
oil spill in U.S. history. The company earlier paid BP about $1
billion to settle claims. The U.S. has also sued BP and Anadarko
Petroleum Corp., which held a 25 percent interest in the well,
over Clean Water Act violations. </p>
<p>The settlement is the first of a series of expected
agreements with the U.S. as lawsuits over the 2010 spill
approach a trial set for Feb. 27. The U.S. Justice Department
sued MOEX, BP, Anadarko and Transocean Ltd. (RIG), which owned the rig
that exploded, in December 2010, seeking fines for each barrel
of oil discharged. </p>
<p>The MOEX settlement doesn''t affect claims against or
potential recoveries from other companies over the spill, the
Justice Department said Feb. 17. MOEX no longer owns a share of
the lease, the U.S. said. </p>
<p>The Macondo well blowout and the explosion that followed
killed 11 workers. The sinking of Transocean''s Deepwater Horizon
drilling rig and subsequent spill led to hundreds of lawsuits
against London-based BP and its partners and contractors. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier in New Orleans, who''s
overseeing much of the spill litigation, has scheduled a nonjury
trial for Feb. 27 to determine liability and apportion fault for
the disaster. </p>
<p>MOEX said in the consent decree that it wasn''t admitting
any liability under the Clean Water Act. The settlement also
wasn''t an admission by the MOEX entities of any liability for
civil payments or any other claim out of or relating to the
Deepwater Horizon incident, according to the filing. </p>
<p>The government case is U.S. v. BP Exploration  Production
Inc., 2:10-cv-04536, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Louisiana (New Orleans). The lawsuit is part of In Re Oil Spill
by the Oil Rig Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico on April
20, 2010, MDL-2179, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Louisiana (New Orleans). </p>

<h2>Facebook Wins Lawsuit Against Power Ventures Over Login Data </h2>
<p>Facebook Inc. (FB), operator of the world''s largest social-
networking site, won a 2008 lawsuit accusing Power Ventures
Inc.''s Power.com of accessing and storing users'' login data
without authorization. </p>
<p>The ruling Feb. 16 by U.S. District Judge James Ware paves
the way for hearings on damages for Facebook. </p>
<p>The undisputed facts establish that defendants
circumvented technical barriers to access Facebook''s site,
Ware wrote in a 19-page opinion issued without a trial. </p>
<p>Facebook sued Power Ventures in December 2008 in federal
court in San Jose, California, saying Power.com offered users
the ability to retrieve their Facebook messages and other
information from Facebook''s computer servers without permission. </p>
<p>Facebook, based in Menlo Park, California, accused
Power.com of infringing its copyrights and trademarks and
violating computer fraud and unfair competition laws. It sought
a court order prohibiting further access and unspecific damages. </p>
<p>Power Ventures is based in the Cayman Islands, according to
court papers. Power.com is up for sale on the Internet. </p>
<p>We are pleased that the court ruled in our favor, Craig
Clark, lead litigation counsel for Facebook, said in an e-mailed
statement. We will continue to enforce our rights against bad
actors who attempt to circumvent Facebook''s privacy and security
protections and spam people. </p>
<p>Facebook has established a dangerous precedent for the
future of users'' rights to own and control their data, said
Steven Vachani, chief executive officer of Power Ventures, in an
e-mailed statement. We intend to aggressively continue this
fight. </p>

<h2>New Suits </h2>
<h2>BNY Accused of $1.5 Billion Fraud in Amended U.S. Complaint </h2>
<p>Bank of New York Mellon Corp., the world''s largest custody
bank, defrauded clients of more than $1.5 billion through
foreign-exchange trades, according to a new complaint by the
U.S. government. </p>
<p>The bank repeatedly lied about a service for foreign
currency transactions and defrauded clients, including pension
funds and federally insured financial institutions, of more than
$1.5 billion, the U.S. Attorney''s Office in Manhattan said in an
amended complaint. It was filed Feb. 16, according to the
office. </p>
<p>The government''s lawsuit is one of several brought against
the bank, including one by New York Attorney General Eric
Schneiderman, alleging it defrauded clients through its so-
called standing instruction foreign-exchange service. </p>
<p>Standing instruction was so much more profitable to BNYM
than any other foreign exchange service because it relied on a
fraudulent business model, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in
the filing. </p>
<p>In the first complaint filed in October, the U.S.
Attorney''s Office said the bank defrauded clients of hundreds
of millions of dollars. Part of the lawsuit was resolved under
an agreement approved last month. </p>
<p>As we have said before regarding this lawsuit, we believe
it is without merit, and we will defend ourselves in court,
said Kevin Heine, a Bank of New York spokesman. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK), 11-6969,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<h2>Harbinger Capital, Falcone Sued Over LightSquared Investment </h2>
<p>Hedge fund manager Phil Falcone and his Harbinger Capital
Partners were sued by a New York woman who claims she and others
were misled about the fund''s decision to put most of the money
they invested into LightSquared Inc. (SKYT) </p>
<p>Lili Schad, a Wallkill, New York, resident who said she
invested $4 million with Harbinger, claims she wasn''t told that
more than 60 percent of the partnership''s money went into
LightSquared, a company attempting to build a high-speed
wireless network, according to a complaint filed Feb. 17 in
federal court in Manhattan. </p>
<p>Schad, who seeks to represent all the limited partners in
Harbinger Capital Partners Fund I LP, also claims she wasn''t
informed that LightSquared''s plan to build the network faced
obstacles from U.S. regulators. The suit seeks unspecified
damages. </p>
<p>Had plaintiff known that defendants would concentrate the
fund''s investments in LightSquared or known of the regulatory
obstacles the company faced, she would have refrained from
investing in the fund or immediately sought to withdraw her
investment from the fund, Schad said in the complaint. </p>
<p>Schad alleged that Harbinger allowed some favored
investors, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., to redeem their
investments on terms unavailable to others. She said that in
2009 Harbinger let Goldman Sachs redeem a $50 million investment
in the fund. </p>
<p>Lew Phelps, an outside spokesman for Harbinger Capital,
didn''t immediately return a phone message seeking comment on the
suit. </p>

<h2>Lawsuits/Pretrial </h2>
<h2>Geithner Should Testify in JPMorgan Suit, Lehman Says </h2>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner should to be
ordered to give a deposition in Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)''s
lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), which alleged the bank
siphoned $8.6 billion out of Lehman in the 2008 credit crisis,
helping to cause its collapse, the defunct firm and its
creditors said. </p>
<p>Lehman has a March 16 deadline for completing its fact
finding in the case, after interviewing more than 200 witnesses,
creditors said in a filing in U.S. District Court in Washington.
Lehman is asking a federal judge to order Geithner to be
interviewed by lawyers for the firm and its creditors. The
Treasury Department has for many months delayed and ultimately
refused to allow the testimony of Secretary Timothy F.
Geithner, which is key to the case, they said. </p>
<p>The filing, e-mailed to Bloomberg, was confirmed by a
Lehman official who declined to be named. The filing was made in
person, the official said. It couldn''t be immediately confirmed
in court records. </p>
<p>Geithner, at the time president of the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York, discussed the collateral JPMorgan was demanding for
its loans with Richard Fuld and James Dimon, Lehman''s and
JPMorgan''s chief executive officers, in the week before Lehman''s
bankruptcy, according to the filing. He also met with Dimon and
Henry Paulson, then Treasury Secretary, to discuss concerns
that Dimon was using the crisis to strengthen his bank at
Lehman''s expense, they said. </p>
<p>The Treasury also has refused to let Paulson testify,
creditors said. They would address the refusal separately, they
said. Lehman''s official committee of creditors works closely
with the defunct firm on its plans and lawsuits, it has said. </p>
<p>Anthony Coley, a Treasury Department spokesman, didn''t
immediately return a phone call and e-mail message seeking
comment on the filing. Joseph Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman,
didn''t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on
Lehman creditors'' account of Dimon''s conversations with
officials. </p>
<p>Lehman filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history in
2008, listing $613 billion in debt. </p>
<p>The main case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
08-13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). The lawsuit is Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 10-03266, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,

<h2>New York Seeks to Pursue Ernst  Young Lehman Fee Suit </h2>
<p>Ernst  Young LLP, bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEH)''s
former auditor, should disgorge $125 million in fees earned
in an alleged fraud involving so-called Repo 105 transactions
that concealed tens of billions of dollars in debt, the New York
attorney general said. </p>
<p>Attorney General Eric Schneiderman asked a judge Feb. 17 to
let him pursue the suit after the auditing firm tried to get it
dismissed. The state is limited by law from recovering the fees
for itself or for Lehman''s former shareholders, Ernst  Young
said. </p>
<p>EY is wrong on every count, Schneiderman said in a
court filing in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. It is well-
settled that the state can, and frequently does, obtain
disgorgement of ill-gotten gains under public enforcement
statutes. </p>
<p>Repo 105 transactions are a form of short-term financing
that Lehman used to move as much as $50 billion off its balance
sheet temporarily to show investors it wasn''t carrying too much
debt, according to a bankruptcy examiner''s report. The report
was used as a basis for many suits, including one that Ernst 
Young is fighting by investors including the Alameda County
Employees'' Retirement Association, which alleges the firm made
misleading statements about Lehman''s finances before its 2008
bankruptcy. </p>
<p>Charlie Perkins, an Ernst  Young spokesman, didn''t
immediately respond to a call and e-mail after regular business
hours seeking comment on the attorney general''s filing. The
auditing firm has said its work for Lehman met all applicable
professional standards and applied rules that existed at the
time. </p>
<p>Schneiderman said New York wasn''t suing on behalf of
Lehman''s shareholders and could distribute money obtained from
the suit in any manner that serves justice, including to the
state. </p>
<p>Lehman filed the biggest U.S. bankruptcy in history in
September 2008 with $639 billion in assets. It has said it will
spend the next few years completing a liquidation to pay
unsecured creditors less than 18 cents on the dollar. </p>
<p>The case is People of the State of New York v. Ernst 
Young LLP, 11-cv-00384, U.S. District Court, Southern District
of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<h2>Legal Challenge to Google Privacy Policy Is Baseless, U.S. Says </h2>
<p>A privacy group should lose its bid for a court order
forcing the Federal Trade Commission to challenge Google Inc. (GOOG)''s
changes to its privacy policy, the U.S. Justice Department said. </p>
<p>The Electronic Privacy Information Center has no basis in
the law to compel the FTC to take enforcement action against
Google, said Drake Cutini, a Justice Department lawyer, in a
filing Feb. 17 in federal court in Washington. The privacy group
sued Feb. 8, claiming Google''s planned changes to its privacy
policy violate a consent order requiring the search engine
company to protect consumer data. </p>
<p>The group said in its complaint that the FTC should sue
Google. The consent order stems from a lawsuit that the group,
known as EPIC, filed against Google. </p>
<p>We are asking the court to dismiss the case because
parties such as EPIC are barred by law from interfering with the
proper investigation and enforcement of FTC orders, Claudia
Farrell, an FTC spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>There can be no question that the Federal Trade
Commission has a duty to enforce its final order in the Google
matter, Marc Rotenberg, EPIC''s executive director, said in an
e-mail. </p>
<p>Google, the world''s most-popular search engine, announced
plans on Jan. 24 to unify privacy policies for 60 services and
products including YouTube videos and Android software for
mobile phones. The move, set to take effect March 1, would
simplify conditions for user agreements, the Mountain View,
California-based company said. </p>
<p>EPIC said the plan would allow Google to combine more
information about users, reduce users'' control of their own data
and give more personal information to advertisers. </p>
<p>The FTC''s 2011 settlement with Google over privacy, which
barred sharing user data outside the company without clear
permission, stemmed from a complaint filed by the advocacy group
in 2010. </p>

<h2>Credit Suisse Trader Case Was Most Popular Docket on Bloomberg </h2>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission''s suit against
Kareem Serageldin, Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)''s former global head
of structured credit trading, was the most-read docket on the
Bloomberg Law system last week for the second week in a row. </p>
<p>Serageldin was charged in a scheme to falsify prices tied
to collateralized debt obligations to meet targets and boost
year-end bonuses for his $5.35 billion trading book. </p>
<p>Serageldin, 38, who lives in the U.K. and led the

<p>Sergey Aleynikov, a former Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) computer programmer, walked out of a New York
courthouse the day after his conviction for stealing the bank''s
high-speed trading code was reversed by a U.S. appeals court. </p>
<p>Wearing a grey sweatsuit, white tennis shoes and a huge
grin, Aleynikov, 42, left the building where he had been
convicted in December 2010 and entered a waiting car with his
lawyer, Kevin Marino. </p>
<p>Justice occasionally works, Aleynikov told reporters as
he left Feb. 17. This was such big news to me I haven''t had
any time to think about what would happen. </p>
<p>Aleynikov, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Russia, said
he hoped to be with his three daughters, ages 8, 6 and 3. Until
Feb. 17, he had been serving an eight-year sentence at the
federal prison in Fort Dix, New Jersey. </p>
<p>I''m very grateful to my mother and my aunt who supported
me from Russia, and my friends who stood by me and believed in
my innocence, he said. One lesson you learn is to really
start valuing your life, day-to-day is a victory. </p>
<p>After hearing oral arguments from both prosecutors and
Marino Feb. 16, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Manhattan issued a
one-page order vacating Aleynikov''s convictions for economic
espionage and the interstate transportation of stolen property.
The appeals court said it would issue an opinion explaining the
ruling later. </p>
<p>The appeals court also issued a mandate that would have
foreclosed any further challenge to its decision. The office of
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara persuaded the court to set
aside the mandate so it can argue for a rehearing of the appeal,
either before a three-judge panel or all the court''s available
judges. Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for Bharara''s office,
declined to comment on the ruling. </p>
<p>Marino said he was confident the appeals court''s decision
would stand. </p>
<p>It''s over now, said Marino, of Marino, Tortorella 
Boyle PC in Chatham, New Jersey. We''re on firm ground. This
was a wrongheaded prosecution that should never have been
brought. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Denise Cote, who presided over the
trial, ordered Aleynikov released from prison Feb. 17. After a
brief hearing this afternoon with prosecutors, Aleynikov and his
lawyers, she agreed to release him on his own recognizance. </p>
<p>Aleynikov was convicted by a jury in December 2010 of
violating the Economic Espionage Act and the Interstate
Transportation of Stolen Property Act. He was sentenced last
March. </p>
<p>On his last day of work at New York-based Goldman Sachs in
June 2009, Aleynikov uploaded hundreds of thousands of lines of
source code from the firm''s high-frequency trading system,
prosecutors said. </p>
<p>He circumvented Goldman Sachs''s security, sent the code to
a server in Germany, compressed and encrypted it, and took it
with him to a meeting with new employers in Chicago, the U.S.
said. Prosecutors argued Aleynikov wanted it as a cheat
sheet to start a trading system at his new job. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Aleynikov, 1:10-cr-00096, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<h2>Patent </h2>
<h2>HTC Loses Patent Case Against Apple at Trade Agency </h2>
<p>HTC Corp. (2498) lost a patent-infringement claim against Apple
Inc. (AAPL) at the U.S. International Trade Commission, the first of
the Taiwanese handset maker''s cases targeting the iPhone. </p>
<p>Apple didn''t violate an HTC patent for controlling how
mobile phones manage power supply, the Washington-based
commission said Feb. 16. The ruling completes a review of an
October finding by an agency judge, who had determined that
Apple devices didn''t infringe HTC''s intellectual property. </p>
<p>The commission also found that HTC wasn''t using the
invention at issue in the case, a requirement to have an
infringement violation found against another company. The
agency''s full opinion will be made available after both sides
have a chance to redact confidential information. </p>
<p>We are disappointed by the commission''s ruling, and look
forward to reading the full opinion to understand its
reasoning, Grace Lei, HTC''s general counsel, said in an e-
mail. We''ll explore all options, including appeal. </p>
<p>HTC, the second-largest maker of devices that run on Google
Inc. (GOOG)''s Android software, has a second case against Apple that is
scheduled to begin Aug. 30. Cupertino, California-based Apple
and Taoyuan, Taiwan-based HTC have been using patent lawsuits to
help protect their share of the smartphone market, which
expanded 55 percent last quarter. </p>
<p>Apple filed first in March 2010, seeking to block imports
of HTC''s Android phones. Apple contends that Android devices
infringe its patents. The commission, which can ban imports of
products found to infringe U.S. patents, found in December that
HTC was infringing an Apple patent related to data-detection.
HTC said it''s been able to design around that feature. </p>
<p>The HTC case against Apple is In the Matter of Portable
Electronic Devices, 337-721, U.S. International Trade Commission
(Washington). </p>
<h2>Apple Files Competition Claim Against Motorola Mobility </h2>
<p>Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. (MMI) said Apple Inc. filed a
complaint with the European Union''s competition authority
accusing the company of violating a pledge to license industry-
standard patents on fair terms. </p>
<p>Motorola Mobility said in a regulatory filing that it was
notified of the complaint Feb. 17 by the European Commission.
Jennifer Erickson, a Motorola Mobility spokeswoman, said the
company is willing to negotiate a patent license with Apple. </p>
<p>Apple and Motorola Mobility have sued each other in the
U.S. and Europe over technology used in smartphones, a market
that researcher IDC said grew 55 percent last year. Motorola
Mobility won two out of three rulings in lawsuits it filed
against Apple in a Mannheim, Germany, court, and in one case
forced Apple to remove some older iPhone and iPad models from
its online store in Germany. </p>
<p>Companies often collaborate on standards that are used to
make products work together, with participants pledging to
fairly license any patents on the standards they help create.
Apple contends Motorola Mobility (MMI) is violating that commitment.
Motorola Mobility, which has said it''s been in licensing talks
with Apple since 2007, denied the charge. </p>
<p>MMI has a long-standing practice of licensing our patents
on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and we offered
those to Apple, Erickson said. </p>
<p>German courts have become the focal point of litigation
between the two companies, with each seeking orders that would
limit sales of the others'' products. On Feb. 16, a court in
Munich said Motorola Mobility''s mobile phones infringe an Apple
patent for a method of unlocking touch screens. </p>
<p>Google Inc., which is buying Libertyville, Illinois-based
Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, pledged to continue the
company''s licensing practices. Regulators in Europe and the U.S.
granted approval to the purchase while expressing some
reservation about how industry-standard patents are handled. </p>
<h2>Hyundai, Kia Sued by Toyota Foe in Fight Over Hybrids </h2>
<p>Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp. (000270) were named in a
patent-infringement lawsuit filed by a company that had been
embroiled in a years-long fight with Toyota Motor Corp. over
hybrid-engine technology. </p>
<p>Closely held Paice LLC and Baltimore''s Abell Foundation, a
non-profit that''s invested in Paice, filed the suit Feb. 16 in
federal court in Baltimore, accusing the Seoul-based automakers
of infringing three patents. </p>
<p>The complaint targets Hyundai''s Sonata Hybrid and the Kia
Optima Hybrid. Hyundai and Kia, which are affiliated and whose
hybrid vehicles use the same powertrain technology, were aware
of the patent litigation with Toyota. The litigation ended with
a 2010 settlement reached after eight years of legal fighting,
Paice said. </p>
<p>Since as early as 2004, Paice has contacted Hyundai on
numerous occasions and offered to discuss its patented hybrid
technology, Paice said in the complaint. The company is
seeking cash compensation and an order that prevents further use
of the technology without permission. </p>
<p>Hyundai Motor America is still examining the issues
raised in the lawsuit, which we received a short time ago, and
is not able to comment on the specifics of the suit at this
time, Chris Hosford, a spokesman for Hyundai said. Officials
with Kia couldn''t immediately be reached for comment. </p>
<p>Paice was founded by Alex Severinsky, a Soviet emigrant who
began his career developing antitank-warfare instrumentation. In
the 1990s, he developed a high-voltage method to power gas-
electric vehicles that he contends is the basis for modern
hybrid technology. </p>
<p>Ford Motor Co., maker of the Fusion hybrid car, also agreed
to license Paice''s technology to resolve lawsuits. </p>
<p>The case is Paice LLC v. Hyundai Motor Co. (005380), 12cv499, U.S.
District Court for the District of Maryland (Baltimore). </p>

<h2>Copyright </h2>
<h2>Megaupload Defendants Face More Criminal Counts, U.S. Says </h2>
<p>Megaupload.com, a file-sharing website charged with
illegally distributing copyrighted movies and music, faces more
counts of criminal copyright infringement and wire fraud. </p>
<p>A revised indictment filed in a U.S. court in Alexandria,
Virginia, on Feb. 16 charged Megaupload.com and founder Kim Dotcom with three new criminal copyright counts and five new
wire fraud counts for allegedly running an illegal enterprise
for five years that unlawfully copied works and made them
available for download to customers. The original Jan. 5
indictment included five counts. </p>
<p>Since September 2005, what prosecutors have dubbed the
Mega Conspiracy has generated more than $175 million in
criminal proceeds by distributing millions of copies of
copyrighted works, such as movies, television programs, music,
books, video games and software, according to the indictment. </p>
<p>Megaupload reproduced copyrighted works directly from other
websites including Google Inc.''s YouTube for illegal sharing and
to give the false impression that a related video-sharing
website hosted user-generated, rather than copyrighted, content,
prosecutors said in an e-mailed statement on Feb. 17. </p>
<p>The conspiracy was led by Dotcom, a resident of Hong Kong

<p>Spider-Man'' Trial Over Script Royalties Scheduled for January </p>
<p>Director Julie Taymor and the producers of Spider-Man:
Turn Off the Dark are set to square off in federal court in
Manhattan in January, 10 years after Marvel Entertainment (MVL) began
negotiating for its superhero to fly on Broadway. </p>
<p>In court on Feb. 17, U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest
scheduled a jury trial to start Jan. 7, to resolve Taymor''s
claim that she''s owed money as co-author of the show. </p>
<p>On Feb. 16, producers and the Stage Directors and
Choreographers Society announced a settlement regarding her
director royalties. The lead producers are Michael Cohl and
Jeremiah Harris. </p>
<p>Taymor, 59, was removed from the stunt-filled $75 million
musical in March, 2011, after critics lambasted it during an
extended preview period. She sued the producers on Nov. 8,
saying they violated her intellectual property rights by making
changes without her permission and didn''t pay royalties due her
as a co-book writer. </p>
<p>In her suit, Taymor claims she''s owed at least $2,917.50 a
week from April 17, 2011, to the present, plus damages. </p>
<p>Dale Cendali, a lawyer in the New York office of Kirkland 
Ellis who represents  Cohl and Harris''s 8 Legged Productions,
declined to comment after the hearing. Taymor''s spokesman, Chris
Kanarick, didn''t return an e-mail on Feb. 17. </p>
<p>The case is Julie Taymor v. 8 Legged Productions LLC, 1:11-
cv-08002-RJH, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>

<h2>Pirate Bay Website Infringes U.K. Record Copyrights, Judge Rules </h2>
<p>Sony Corp. (6758)''s British unit and eight other record labels won
a U.K. trial on their claims that users and operators of Pirate
Bay, the Sweden-based website used for online file sharing,
violate their copyrights. </p>
<p>The operators of the site, who weren''t represented at the
trial, incite or persuade users to commit copyright
infringement, Judge Richard Arnold ruled yesterday in London.
The users have a common design to infringe. </p>
<p>While Pirate Bay isn''t a defendant, the court''s finding was
required before the record labels could seek a court order
forcing British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY) and five other
Internet-service providers to block access to the site,
according to the judgment. Arnold said the case was similar to a
landmark ruling last year in which ISPs were ordered to block
access to a file-sharing website known as Newzbin. </p>
<p>Pirate Bay enables downloading of digitized music and films
using software called BitTorrent that enables complete works to
be assembled from pieces on other users'' computers. The site has
faced civil and criminal proceedings in other countries,
including in Sweden. Arnold said the website was openly opposed
to the record labels'' copyrights. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) filed a complaint
with European antitrust regulators saying Motorola Mobility
Holdings Inc. (MMI) and Google Inc. (GOOG) are trying to block sales of
personal computers and game consoles that run its software. </p>
<p>Motorola Mobility is violating a pledge to license
industry-standard patents on fair terms and demanding that
Microsoft take its products off the market, Microsoft said in
a blog post. Apple Inc. (AAPL) has also filed a complaint to the
European Union over Motorola Mobility''s licensing terms. </p>
<p>We have taken this step because Motorola is attempting to
block sales of Windows PCs, our Xbox game console and other
products, Microsoft said. Legal actions by Motorola Mobility
to enforce its patents may kill video-streaming services on
the Internet, Microsoft said. </p>
<p>Motorola Mobility, Microsoft, Samsung Electronics Co. and
Apple are involved in numerous patent lawsuits in Europe as
demand for smartphones and tablets soar. Google, which is buying
Libertyville, Illinois-based Motorola Mobility for $12.5
billion, has written to groups that establish industry standards
to assure them it will license Motorola Mobility patents on a
fair and reasonable basis. </p>
<h2>Step Back'' </h2>
<p>Watching video on the Web is one of the primary uses of
computers these days, Microsoft said in its statement.
Imagine what a step back it would be if we could no longer
watch videos on our computing devices or connect via Wi-Fi, or
if only some products, but not others, had these capabilities,
it said. </p>
<p>We are yet to receive a copy of the complaint, but
Motorola is committed to vigorously defending its intellectual
property, Gemma Goatly, a spokeswoman for Motorola Mobility,
said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s complaint also covers Google because the firm
hasn''t committed to changing Motorola Mobility''s policy, the
Redmond, Washington-based company said. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s complaint is just another example of their
attempts to use the regulatory process to attack competitors,
Niki Fenwick, a spokesperson for Google, said in an e-mailed
statement. It''s particularly ironic given their track record
in this area and collaboration with patent trolls. </p>
<p>The European Commission has received this complaint and
we will examine it, Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for EU
antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia, said in an e-mail. Samsung is
already being investigated by EU antitrust regulators over
whether it broke licensing commitments. </p>
<h2>Playground Monitor'' </h2>
<p>The European Commission is a little bit, in this context,
like the playground monitor when it comes to U.S. technology
companies, said Andrew Updegrove, a lawyer with Gesmer
Updegrove LLP in Boston who advises standard-setting boards on
intellectual property policies. </p>
<p>It''s really a kind of scuffle where everyone tries to
bend the ear of the European Commission to make life
uncomfortable for their rivals, Updegrove said. </p>
<p>Motorola Mobility also has filed complaints against Apple
and Microsoft at the U.S. International Trade Commission in
Washington, to block imports of Apple''s iPhone and Microsoft''s
xBox into the U.S. Apple and Microsoft have argued that the
agency shouldn''t issue exclusion orders when the patents are
essential to industry standards. </p>
<p>Both Microsoft and Apple have said they wouldn''t seek a
court order to block use of technology covered by industry-
standard patents even as they pursue infringement claims over
non-essential patents against Motorola Mobility. </p>
<p>Google has said it would seek a royalty fee of no more than
2.25 percent of the net cost of devices using its patents, and
would try to resolve any disputes through negotiation before
asking courts to block use of the Motorola Mobility technology. </p>
<p>We are aware of the increasingly strategic use of patents
in the sector and are vigilant, the EU''s Almunia said Feb. 13.
We can avoid a continuation of this patent war. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s (GS) hedge

<p>OMV AG (OMV), central Europe''s biggest oil
company, said it discovered what may be its biggest gas find in
a Black Sea well it is exploring together with a unit of Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM) Shares soared in Vienna trading. </p>
<p>The exploration well encountered 70.7 meters of net gas
pay, resulting in a preliminary estimate for the accumulation
ranging from 1.5 to 3 trillion cubic feet (42 to 84 billion
cubic meters), OMV said in a statement today. </p>
<p>The Domino-1 well, which is operated by the Exxon unit, is
located in the Neptun Block, 170 kilometers (106 miles) offshore
in water about 1,000 meters deep, according to the statement.
Drilling operations started at year-end 2011 and the total depth
of the well is expected to be more than 3,000 meters below sea
level. OMV Petrom (SNP) and Exxon each hold 50 percent in the well. </p>
<p>This may be the biggest find in OMV''s history, Chief
Executive Officer Gerhard Roiss told reporters in Vienna today. </p>
<p>OMV shares advanced after the announcement, climbing 4.3
percent to 28.78 euros at the 5:30 p.m. close of trading in the
Austrian capital. Petrom shares rose 5.1 percent to 0.41 lei in
Bucharest. </p>
<h2>Multi-Billion Dollar Investment </h2>
<p>The companies are planning new 3D seismic acquisition
during 2012, Jaap Huijskes, who heads exploration and production
at OMV, said. </p>
<p>While it is too early in the data evaluation and
exploration process to determine whether the Neptun block will
ultimately prove to be commercially developable or not, the
companies would need to spend multiple billions of dollars to
develop Domino-1, he said, adding that potential first
production would be toward the end of the decade at the
earliest. </p>
<p>Exxon''s Romania unit head Ian Fischer said in August that
the first drilling of the well may cost about $150 million
and that the companies may invest between $3 billion and $10
billion to operate the block if the testing proves to be
successful, according to Mediafax. OMV today declined to comment
on specific amounts. </p>
<p>Appraisal wells and 3D Seismic will take some time, the
Black Sea is not off the coast of Aberdeen, it takes some time
to get rigs into the Black Sea and it takes time to get seismic
vessels into the Black Sea, Huijskes said, declining to
specify a time frame. </p>
<p>Setting up the rig for the initial drilling took one year
as it had to be dismantled to pass under bridges in the
Bosphorus Straits, said CEO Rois. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) cut its 12-
month prediction for commodity returns, while forecasting gains
for crude oil and gold and keeping an overweight allocation
in raw materials. </p>
<p>The bank reduced its estimate for returns to 12 percent
from 15 percent after prices rallied this year, analysts led by
Jeffrey Currie said in a report today. They kept their
predictions for Brent and gold at $127.50 a barrel and $1,940 an
ounce compared with $121.23 and $1,755.30 today. </p>
<p>Commodities advanced 8.5 percent this year to the highest
level in six months as measured by the Standard  Poor''s GSCI
index of 24 raw materials. Prices climbed as the U.S. economy
strengthened and the Chinese central bank cut reserve
requirements. While Morgan Stanley is also bullish on gold, it
expects oil prices to decline in the first half as supply
recovers and demand slows, it said in a report Feb. 20. </p>
<p>With much of the value'' opportunities behind us, we look
to fundamental drivers for further expected gains in 2012, which
we believe will be centered in the oil complex, said Goldman.
Oil climbed to a nine-month high in New York yesterday after
Greece won a second bailout. Gold advanced 12 percent this year. </p>
<p>The bank is bullish on oil because the price is vulnerable
to supply disruptions from Iran and elsewhere and OPEC spare
capacity is at a trough just as the world economic recovery
is gaining momentum, it said. </p>
<h2>Iran, China </h2>
<p>The European Union agreed last month to ban crude imports
from Iran starting July 1 to increase pressure on the country
over its nuclear program. The Middle Eastern country said Feb.
19 it stopped selling crude to France and Britain. </p>
<p>Brent for April delivery fell 0.4 percent to $121.23 in
London today and gold for the same month in New York declined
0.2 percent to $1,755.30. </p>
<p>Manufacturing in China, the biggest consumer of energy and
industrial metals, may shrink for a fourth month in February,
indicating the economy remains vulnerable to a deeper slowdown
as Europe''s crisis caps exports and the home market cools. </p>
<p>The preliminary 49.7 reading of an index from HSBC Holdings
Plc and Markit Economics today compared with a final 48.8 in
January. A number below 50 signals a contraction. January and
February economic data are distorted by a weeklong holiday. </p>
<p>Chinese construction activity and consumer appliance
output remain relatively weak, the Goldman analysts said.
Recent fundamental developments leave us happy to stay on the
sidelines of industrial metals for now, it said. </p>
<p>The bank predicts copper and aluminum at $9,000 a ton and
$2,400 a ton in 12 months compared with $8,421.50 and $2,257 now. </p>
<p>The analysts see little outright opportunity in
agriculture, predicting lower prices in wheat and corn in 12
months and a 2 percent gain in soybeans. </p>

<p>Policy makers mustn''t underestimate
the consequences of a possible Greek euro exit, which could
spark a run on lenders and overwhelm the European Central Bank,
said Joachim Fels, Morgan Stanley''s head of global economics. </p>
<p>Investors are relieved there was a deal, Fels said on
Bloomberg Television''s Surveillance Midday yesterday, after 
Greece won a second bailout this week for 130 billion euros 
($173 billion) to avert default. This crisis isn''t over. </p>
<p>European finance ministers agreed to provide Greece with
the rescue package on Feb. 21 as representatives of the nation''s
private creditors signed up to a debt swap that will lead to a
net present value loss on their holdings of more than 70
percent. The accords, which depend on more Greek austerity, are
intended to help the nation avoid default when bond repayments
come due next month. </p>
<p>Many investors still doubt we''ve resolved the underlying
problems, Fels said. There''s a sigh of relief, but most
people believe there''s probably more to come down the road. </p>
<p>Even with investors and central bankers chipping in to
relieve the debt burden, economists see risks that Greece may
again fail to deliver on its fiscal pledges amid a fifth year of
recession, looming elections and social unrest. Some investors
and policy makers underestimate the consequences that would come
from Greece exiting the euro, Fels said. </p>
<h2>Complacency'' </h2>
<p>I detect a certain amount of complacency, he said. A
Greek exit would stoke doubts about the euro''s future, meaning
investors and citizens would no longer believe that a 1 euro
bank deposit in Portugal and Italy is the same as 1 euro bank
deposit in Germany. You''d get a run on banks, another run on
sovereigns and this could well be too big for the ECB to
counter. </p>
<p>Europe''s economy will shrink in 2012, with Italy and Spain
facing sudden crunches as they battle to escape the debt crisis,
the European Commission said in a report today. To cushion the
fall, the ECB will probably reduce its benchmark lending rate
further after two 25 basis-point cuts since November, Fels said. </p>
<p>The ECB has been reasonably aggressive, but if you want
to boost demand further, you need to see more aggressive
action, he said. We think we''ll get more rate cuts and
potentially the ECB might move to outright quantitative easing
later this year. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s Luca Ferrari, an investment banker to Xstrata Plc (XTA) on its proposed
merger with Glencore International Plc, is leaving the company
after 12 years. </p>
<p>Ferrari, a managing director based in London and head of
Northern European MA at the firm, joined from UBS Warburg in
2000. He was named a partner in 2006, according to an internal
memo seen by Bloomberg News and confirmed by a spokeswoman in
London today. </p>
<p>His exit is the third by a senior banker in the investment
bank this month. Goldman Sachs said that George Mattson, head of
the industrials investment-banking group, was leaving the firm.
Jeffrey Moslow, a partner based in New York, will also leave the
company according to a memo. </p>
<p>Ferrari''s clients have included Telefonica SA, Spain''s
largest telephone company. New York-based Goldman Sachs is the
top ranked merger adviser this year, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Glencore (GLEN), the world''s largest publicly traded commodity
trader, plans to combine with Xstrata''s coal and copper mines to
create a business with $209 billion in sales, the companies said
on Feb. 7. The takeover would be the biggest-ever mining deal if
completed and would form a commodities supplier to challenge BHP
Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto Group. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) has more than
tripled its holdings of mortgage securities without U.S.
government guarantees to $72 billion as the nation''s biggest
bank bets on borrowers from outside the country it calls home. </p>
<p>The investments swelled $8.4 billion in the fourth quarter,
climbing from $52.8 billion at the end of 2010 and $19 billion
the prior year, according to regulatory data released last week.
The bank has primarily been adding debt from outside the U.S.,
including bonds tied to U.K. and Dutch mortgages, Securities and
Exchange Commission filings by New York-based JPMorgan show. </p>
<p>The bet is they can get a little more yield in areas
where they think that they''re safe, said Jim Leonard, an
analyst at Morningstar Inc. in Chicago who covers the bank''s
debt. While mortgage bonds carry a stigma after fueling the
worst financial crisis since the 1930s, that can be a little
unfair because many were repaid in full, he added. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon added the
securities even as U.K. economic growth slows toward zero, the
Dutch property market slumps for a third year and Europe''s
leaders try to stem the region''s sovereign-debt crisis. The bank
may be benefiting as bailed-out lenders such as Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc (RBS) and ING Groep NV (INGA) are forced to contract, said
Brad Golding, managing director at Christofferson, Robb  Co. </p>
<p>All of those guys want to shrink their balance sheets,
said Golding, whose New York-based hedge fund manages about $1.4
billion and invests in financial-company credit. At the same
time, the U.S. Federal Reserve''s massive buying of
government-backed mortgage bonds has made those securities
relatively less attractive by pushing down yields, he said. </p>
<p>Justin Perras, a spokesman for JPMorgan, declined to
comment. </p>
<h2>Contrasting Strategy </h2>
<p>The lender''s buying contrasts with the rest of the biggest
U.S. banks. Competitors are trimming holdings of so-called non-
agency mortgage bonds such as U.S. subprime securities that
sparked the housing meltdown, and expanding portfolios of agency
notes guaranteed by government-supported Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac or U.S.-owned Ginnie Mae. </p>
<p>JPMorgan last year shrunk its investments in U.S. agency
mortgage securities by $28.1 billion to $134.7 billion,
according to data compiled by SNL Financial, a Charlottesville,
Virginia-based financial-information and research provider. </p>
<p>The rest of the top-25 banks, including Bank of America
Corp. (BAC) and Citigroup Inc. (C), increased their agency portfolios by
$121.1 billion to $947.8 billion as their non-agency investments
fell $31.6 billion to $98.6 billion, according to data assembled
by SNL from regulatory reports. </p>
<h2>Net Interest Margin </h2>
<p>While banks are benefiting from record low costs being paid
on deposits, they''re facing a squeeze on net interest margins.
That''s the difference between what they pay to borrow money and
what they get for loans and on securities. JPMorgan''s margin
narrowed to 2.7 percent last quarter from 2.88 percent a year
earlier. </p>
<p>The Fed, while holding its target for short-term interest
rates near zero, has contributed to depressing yields by buying
bonds to support the economy. It bought $1.25 trillion of agency
mortgage securities from January 2009 through March 2010 and in
October started to use proceeds from the holdings to buy more. </p>
<p>JPMorgan purchased 1.28 billion euros ($1.7 billion) of
top-rated bonds backed by Dutch home loans from Amsterdam-based
ING in November, according to a person with knowledge of the
deal. It also bought part of a $5.5 billion offering in October
tied to U.K. loans originated by RBS and National Westminster
Home Loans, said a banker familiar with that transaction. They
declined to be identified because terms weren''t public. </p>
<h2>Taxpayer Money </h2>
<p>ING, the biggest Dutch financial-services firm, sold its
U.S. online bank last week to McLean, Virginia-based Capital One
Financial Corp. as a condition of its government bailout, while
RBS is shrinking after an injection of 45.5 billion pounds
($71.3 billion) of taxpayer money. </p>
<p>In the RBS deal, JPMorgan bought top-rated debt with a
projected average life of 2.8 years, according to one of the
people. The bonds sold at yields that are 1.6 percentage points
more than the three-month London interbank offered rate, a
floating benchmark set yesterday at 0.49 percent. </p>
<p>These types of bond investments can address the two
problems money managers are facing right now -- the fear of
higher rates and the absolute low level of rates, said John Kerschner, head of securitized products at Janus Capital Group
Inc., which manages about $160 billion of assets. </p>
<h2>Fannie Mae Yields </h2>
<p>While yields on newly issued Fannie Mae mortgage securities
averaged 3.18 percent in October, the debt''s expected life was
more than two years longer than the RBS notes and can extend as
homeowner refinancing drops, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That leaves investors more exposed to the risk of
rising interest rates. </p>
<p>Yields on slices of repackaged agency mortgage debt that
protect investors from higher rates by limiting maturities
averaged 1.22 percent in October, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch''s 0-3 Year PAC Agency CMO index. </p>
<p>JPMorgan had $2.27 trillion of assets as of Dec. 31, up
from $2.12 trillion a year earlier. Securities holdings,
excluding trading assets, climbed $48.5 billion to $364.8
billion, and loans rose $30.8 billion to $723.7 billion as the
economic recovery slowed, limiting demand. </p>
<p>The bank held $57.5 billion of residential-mortgage
securities tied to loans outside the U.S. and $2.3 billion of
bonds backed by so-called prime and Alt-A (BBMDADLQ) U.S. loans on Sept. 30
in the available-for-sale accounting designation, according to
an SEC filing. Under that category, changes in the values aren''t
reflected in earnings. The prime and Alt-A investments were down
from almost $7 billion at the end of 2008, while the non-U.S.
mortgage debt rose from $2.1 billion, an earlier filing showed. </p>
<h2>Unrealized Losses </h2>
<p>The bank had unrealized losses of $530 million on those
overseas bonds, substantially all of which stemmed from
securities with ratings of AAA, AA or A from the U.K. and
Netherlands, according to its third-quarter filing, the most
recent available. </p>
<p>Its portions of the deals can withstand losses of about 10
percent on the underlying mortgages because other classes will
take writedowns first. JPMorgan said it projects lifetime losses
of 1.5 percent. The so-called credit enhancement on the U.K.
bonds it bought in October was 22.4 percent of losses. </p>
<p>Home prices in the U.K. fell 1.8 percent in the last 12
months, while unemployment is at 8.4 percent, the highest rate
for 16 years, according to Halifax and government data. A push
to balance the U.K.''s finances probably will reduce growth to
0.5 percent this year from 0.9 percent in 2011, according to the
median forecast of economists compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Financial Crisis </h2>
<p>Dutch house prices retreated 3.3 percent in the past year,
while the unemployment rate jumped last month to 6 percent, the
highest since February 2006, according to government figures. </p>
<p>Mortgage bonds outside the U.S. held up better during the
global economic slowdown that deepened after Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.''s 2008 collapse. Standard  Poor''s downgraded
almost 48 percent of U.S. residential securities in 2008 and
71.7 percent in 2009, compared with 6.1 percent and 15.3 percent
for their European equivalents, the rating company''s data show. </p>
<p>Sales of securities backed by new U.S. home loans without
government backing have failed to rebound, with less than $1.5
billion of deals since mid-2008 after a record $1.2 trillion in
each of 2005 and 2006, according to Bloomberg data and
newsletter Inside Mortgage Finance. </p>
<p>Issuance of European home-loan bonds totaled 196 billion
euros last year, compared with 269 billion euros in 2006,
according to JPMorgan data. </p>
<p>Banks including JPMorgan are also struggling to find non-
agency U.S. securities that might offer higher yields while
carrying investment-grade ratings, which Morningstar''s Leonard
said appeal to the lenders because they can set aside less
capital than for lower-rated debt. </p>
<p>The opportunities are relatively limited, said Jason Callan, the head of structured products at Columbia Management
Investment Advisers LLC in Minneapolis, which oversees about
$170 billion in fixed-income. Oftentimes, investment-grade
bonds work their way into bank or insurance-company portfolios,
which rarely trade out of those positions. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the world''s
biggest brokerage, is setting up a fixed-income group in Mexico
as part of its expansion in Latin America, said Christopher Harland, the bank''s regional head. </p>
<p>The addition of the fixed-income team follows the bank''s
move to trade stocks on the Mexican exchange, said Harland, a
28-year veteran of the bank. Morgan Stanley operates integrated
securities firms in Brazil and Mexico with smaller
representative offices in Peru and Argentina, a country where
Harland said Morgan Stanley has a number of very high quality
mandates to manage debt and equity offerings. </p>
<p>The increasing trend is to have some physical presence,
Harland said in an interview at Bloomberg''s New York
headquarters yesterday. One person, two people, as small as
that may sound, makes a world of difference. Being local doesn''t
mean going in all guns blazing. Today if you wait for the
different silos to be in place you''ll be too late. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley is building up its staff in the region as
other banks retreat. ING Groep NV, the biggest Dutch financial
services company, cut jobs from its Latin America dollar-
denominated debt group in December, firing five people in
Mexico. </p>
<h2>Very Upbeat'' </h2>
<p>Harland said the number of employees, excluding
secretaries, has climbed to 35 in Mexico from 11 when he took
over the position four years ago. It rose to 205 from 161 in
Brazil, which accounts for about 55 percent of the bank''s
business in Latin America, according to Harland. </p>
<p>I''m very upbeat about the prospects for Brazil, he
said. But I''m even more upbeat in growth terms for some of the
Andean markets. </p>
<p>The yield on Mexico''s benchmark peso-denominated bonds due
in 2024 has dropped 15 basis points, or 0.15 percentage point,
this year to 6.51 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The extra yield investors demand to own Mexican dollar
bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries narrowed 13 basis points this
year to 209, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. The securities
have returned 0.5 percent this year through yesterday, compared
with a 4.1 percent gain for emerging-market debt. </p>

<p>The highest U.S. oil production in
nine years is failing to dissuade Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) from
predicting that the price of the country''s most-traded crude
will keep climbing. </p>
<p>The New York-based bank says West Texas Intermediate will
gain 7 percent by August to trade within $5 a barrel of North
Sea Brent, even as rising output swells the nation''s inventories.
Citigroup Inc. (C) takes the opposite view, forecasting that WTI''s
discount to Brent may widen to $20 a barrel this year, from
about $15.79 yesterday. </p>
<p>There''s a danger in trading the Brent-WTI spread right
now with any strong fundamental conviction, Olivier Jakob,
managing director at Petromatrix GmbH, a Zug, Switzerland-based
oil researcher, said in a phone interview yesterday. </p>
<p>The outlook for WTI is being clouded by a deluge of oil to
Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for WTI futures, amid a
production boom that has cut America''s dependence on imports to
a more than-10-year low. The logjam is likely to be relieved in
June, when flows through the Seaway pipeline are reversed,
giving producers in Canada and North Dakota direct access to
refineries on the Gulf coast, according to Goldman Sachs, which
correctly forecast Brent would decline in April last year and
recover the following month. </p>
<p>Crude oil for April delivery rose as much as 0.8 percent
to $108.70 a barrel in electronic trading today on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, bringing its gain this year to 9.8 percent. </p>
<p>Brent oil for April settlement increased as much as 0.5
percent to $124.28 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange
in London, an advance of 15 percent this year. </p>
<h2>Seaway Flows </h2>
<p>The spread between WTI and Brent will narrow with the
reversal of the Seaway pipeline, David Greely, the New York-
based head of energy research at Goldman Sachs, said in a report
on Feb. 22. With the Seaway flowing from Cushing to the U.S.
Gulf Coast, we expect WTI prices will be closely tied to Brent 
prices, with WTI likely trading at a $3 to $5 discount. </p>
<p>WTI''s discount to Brent widened to a record $27.88 on Oct.
14 last year as U.S. oil shale production boosted supplies to
Cushing while the uprising against Muammar Qaddafi choked off
exports from Libya, driving up the European benchmark grade. The
average in the past nine years is $1.33. </p>
<p>Forward curves, which show monthly futures prices through
to the end of the decade for the two grades, currently indicate
that WTI will remain below Brent until at least 2020, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>U.S. oil production rose 3 percent last year to an average
of about 5.65 million barrels a day, the highest level since
2003, according to Energy Department data. Output will grow a
further 61 percent to 9.1 million barrels a day in 2015, the
most since the 1970s, Raymond James  Associates said in a
report on Feb. 13. </p>
<h2>Not Keeping Pace'' </h2>
<p>The U.S. is choking on crude, Seth Kleinman, the global
head of energy research at Citigroup in London, said in a phone
interview. There are points where the infrastructure build-out
is just not keeping pace. Can Seaway clean up Cushing? Seaway
can tighten the arbitrage, possibly, in the short-term. But in
2013, there''s going to be another 500,000 to 800,000 barrels a
day of oil. </p>
<p>Much of the new North American oil production will remain
landlocked, and therefore heavily discounted, Kleinman said in
a Feb. 15 report. Infrastructure won''t catch up until mid-
decade at the earliest, and perhaps not until much later. </p>
<p>Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD) and Enbridge Inc. (ENB) said on
Nov. 16 that they would reverse flows through the 500-mile (805-
kilometer) Seaway link from June. That may initially divert
150,000 barrels a day out of the region, and then as much as
400,000 a day early next year, helping to clear the surplus that
has depressed WTI in relation to Brent, Goldman Sachs said. </p>
<p>The risk-reward over the next several months favors a
long position in the WTI contracts following the reversal of the
Seaway pipeline, Greely said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will spar
with UniCredit SpA (UCG) over steins of Bavarian beer this autumn as
they jostle to lure German equity investors to rival conferences
in Munich during Oktoberfest. </p>
<p>When UniCredit quit its western European equities business
on Nov. 14, Italy''s largest bank took another month to confirm
that it would team up with Kepler Capital Markets SA to continue
the annual conference it started in 2003. Both Goldman, along
with partner Berenberg Bank, and Baader Bank AG (BWB) had in the
meantime announced similar events, leaving investors with three
ways to spend their days before heading for the beer tents. </p>
<p>Goldman and Berenberg as well as Baader have obviously
opportunistically jumped on this fixed conference date in
people''s diary in the wrong expectation that we would no longer
host the conference, said Christian Steffens, UniCredit''s co-
head of global capital markets. People have always enjoyed
coming to Munich for the conference, as it is a nice place to
be, especially during the Oktoberfest. </p>
<p>The first Oktoberfest was held in 1810 to honor Bavarian
Crown Prince Ludwig''s marriage to Princess Therese von Sachsen-
Hildburghausen. This year''s festival, which runs from Sept. 22
through Oct. 7, will attract about 6 million revelers to the
tents and halls set up by local breweries. </p>
<h2>Economic Strength </h2>
<p>More important for the conference organizers is that
Germany, Europe''s largest economy, continues to buck a recession
that''s gripping the region''s southern countries. </p>
<p>At the moment the whole world is looking at Germany,
said Benon Janos, a Frankfurt-based managing director at
Goldman, who is in charge of the conference in September. </p>
<p>Goldman and Hamburg-based Berenberg start their three-day
German Corporate Conference 2012 on Sept. 24, one day before
their rivals. They have invited more than 100 companies,
according to Janos, and 800 institutional investors are expected
to attend. </p>
<p>Until now, we didn''t have such an event and we wanted to
keep this conference in Munich alive, said Janos. We will
deliver a very good event this year, next year and the year
after that and then we will see. </p>
<p>UniCredit and Kepler, the French securities firm that now
provides research on stocks in western Europe to the Italian
bank''s customers, expect more than 100 company representatives
and about 700 investors to attend their three-day conference,
starting Sept. 25, said Steffens. </p>
<h2>Hiring Organizers </h2>
<p>Baader Bank, the German securities brokerage that is
expanding its capital markets offerings, will invite investors
to Munich''s BMW-Welt venue on the same days as the UniCredit
event. Baader, based in Unterschleissheim near Munich, has hired
Oliver Riedel, Karin Brinkmann and other people who previously
helped arrange the event at UniCredit, said Nico Baader, a
member of the management board and son of founder Uto Baader. </p>
<p>So far, 70 companies have confirmed their attendance and
the bank is targeting 500 to 600 participants, Baader said. </p>
<p>We provide a broad range from blue chips to small caps
and, uniquely, Austrian companies as well, said Baader.
We''re not here to do this once. </p>
<p>While for us, as a Munich-based investor, the Oktoberfest
isn''t as much as an attraction as maybe for U.S. investors, we
don''t mind so much having three conferences on exactly the same
topic simultaneously, said Stefan Degen, who helps manage
about 36 billion euros ($48 billion) as head of equities at
BayernInvest, the asset manager owned by Bayerische Landesbank (BLGZ)
in Munich. We will simply decide where the most interesting
presentations are being offered. </p>
<h2>Starting to Rebuild </h2>
<p>UniCredit and Kepler will have to battle to attract
participants after losing sales people to Baader and other
rivals, said Degen. Kepler is just starting to rebuild those
relationships, he said. </p>
<p>UniCredit can overcome the loss, said Steffens. Linking up
with Kepler has added about 2,000 investor contacts from France,
Spain, Benelux, Scandinavia and the U.S., he said. </p>
<p>We''re confident that this year''s conference will become
even broader in terms of investor participation than last
year''s, when we counted 591 investors, Steffens said
Companies want to see investors from all over the world at
such a conference and we have the track record of being able to
attract them to Munich. </p>
<p>For some companies and investors, the choice will be easy. </p>
<p>We will attend the Goldman/Berenberg conference as we
haven''t been invited by the others, which don''t cover our
stock, said Claudia Gutjahr-Loeser, head of corporate
communications and investor relations at German biotechnology
company MorphoSys AG (MOR). Generally it doesn''t make sense to try
to accommodate three conferences at the same time. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s largest
drugmaker, has agreed to buy closely held Alacer Corp., which
makes dietary supplements including the vitamin C product
Emergen-C. </p>
<p>Terms of the deal weren''t disclosed by New York-based
Pfizer, which plans to divest its nutritional and animal health
units. Alacer, based in Foothill Ranch, California, makes about
500 million packets of the vitamin powder each year, Pfizer said
today in a statement announcing the deal. A 30-pack of Emergen-C
sells for $9.99 on the drugstore Walgreen Co. (WAG)''s website. </p>
<p>Emergen-C products add to and greatly complement our
market-leading dietary supplement portfolio, Paul Sturman,
president of Pfizer Consumer Healthcare, said in the statement. </p>
<p>The brand will become part of Pfizer''s consumer health-care
business, which was acquired with the 2009 purchase of Wyeth.
The unit made up 4.5 percent of Pfizer''s 2011 revenue in 2011.
Pfizer''s dietary supplements line has more than $1 billion in
sales, and the largest product is the Centrum brand
multivitamin. </p>
<p>Shares of Pfizer rose less than 1 percent to $21.26 at the
close in New York. </p>
<p>In 2011, Pfizer bought Danish vitamins company Ferrosan
from Altor Equity Partners AB, a private equity fund, for an
undisclosed amount. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) plans to bring its
Windows Phone software to 23 new countries and put the operating
system on less expensive smartphones, part of an effort to win
back market share lost to Google Inc. (GOOG) and Apple Inc. (AAPL) </p>
<p>Microsoft will kick off the expansion by opening mobile-
application stores in China, Thailand, Venezuela and 20 other
nations by the end of the month, with phones arriving around the
same time, said Terry Myerson, who oversees the company''s
Windows Phone business. That will bring the total number of
markets Microsoft serves to 63, letting it target 60 percent
more buyers, he said. </p>
<p>The company aims to close ranks on Apple, the No. 2
provider of mobile-phone software, and set up a showdown with
Google''s market-leading Android operating system. While research
firm IDC has predicted that Microsoft will leapfrog Apple by
2015, moving up in the ranks won''t be easy, Myerson said. </p>
<p>I wish all I had to do is press a button and say, Make
it happen,'' he said. We''ve got some great strategies to get
there, but it''s not a gimme. We''re a challenger in a market
against two established competitors. </p>
<p>Google and Apple aren''t as entrenched in emerging markets,
which provides an opportunity for Microsoft, said Al Hilwa, an
analyst at Framingham, Massachusetts-based IDC. Global
smartphone sales will top 1 billion units in 2015, with China as
the biggest single market, the research firm estimates. </p>
<h2>Fleeting Chance </h2>
<p>Still, Microsoft will have to move quickly in developing
economies, where cheaper Android phones are gaining a foothold,
Hilwa said. </p>
<p>That opportunity may be fleeting in that we are seeing a
lot of Android phones come down to the low end, he said.
They need more phones, more carriers, more prices, more
languages. </p>
<p>Microsoft also released a test version of its first Skype
video-calling application for Windows Phone today at the Mobile
World Congress show in Barcelona, Spain. The company plans to
have a final version available in April. </p>
<p>Rather than make phones itself, Microsoft supplies its
software to Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) and other handset manufacturers. Those
partners are working on phones with Microsoft''s latest operating
system and showed off new models today at the Barcelona
conference. The company added app stores in Argentina,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Peru and the Philippines earlier this month
to help support the phones. </p>
<h2>Nokia Model </h2>
<p>Nokia announced plans today to sell a Windows Phone priced
at 189 euros ($254) in the second quarter running on the new
software. That''s 30 percent less expensive than Nokia''s current
cheapest Windows Phone. </p>
<p>Microsoft has adapted Windows Phone software so that it
requires half as much memory and runs the cheaper 7X27A chip
from Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) That should help manufacturers cut their
costs by about 30 percent to 40 percent, Myerson said. New
Windows Phones could cost as little as $100 to $200 to make. </p>
<p>In the U.S., those savings are unlikely to be passed along
to consumers, Myerson said. In emerging markets, though, the
changes should lead to cheaper phone prices. </p>
<p>For Windows to be relevant and exciting to consumers in
these countries, we need to be at the price points they buy
consumer electronics at, he said. </p>
<p>Phones based on the new software and cheaper hardware are
slower for certain uses, Myerson said. A small number of apps
also aren''t yet running on the new products, though Microsoft is
working to fix that, he said. </p>
<p>Not in Love? </p>
<p>The effort is particularly important in China, where many
phones cost about $100 to $150 to make, Myerson said. The
country is poised to pass the U.S. as the biggest smartphone
market this year, with Android ranking as the most popular
software, according to IDC. </p>
<p>What Microsoft is counting on is there are a lot of
Android users, but there aren''t a lot of Android lovers, said
Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Stamford, Connecticut-based
Gartner Inc. They think they can convert those people. </p>
<p>Microsoft also is working to persuade more carriers to
offer prepaid Windows Phones -- an approach that''s popular in
emerging markets. Myerson plans to discuss that topic this week
with America Movil SAB (AMX), the biggest mobile-phone carrier in the
Americas. </p>
<p>For now, the new software won''t work on handsets that cost
less than $100 to make. Still, Microsoft might be able to
address that segment someday, Myerson said. </p>
<p>We want to maintain a consistent level of quality, he
said. In the fullness of time, price points come down. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank by assets, should consider breaking up and selling
businesses because its parts are worth one-third more than its
market value, according to Mike Mayo, an analyst at CLSA Ltd. </p>
<p>While JPMorgan''s stock has outperformed its peers, the New
York-based company has trailed the leading firms in its
individual businesses, Mayo wrote in a note e-mailed today.
JPMorgan executives must make the case at tomorrow''s investor
conference for why the firm shouldn''t be broken up, he wrote. </p>
<p>At what point does the conglomerate discount become so
great that it encourages the company to take action? Mayo
wrote. The stock seems undervalued, but the question is how
and when this value gets realized? </p>
<p>Bank stocks including JPMorgan underperformed the broad
market over the past eight years, according to Mayo. Even after
this year''s 15 percent gain, the stock is worth about 2 percent
less than at the end of 2004. Mayo asked whether the firm run by
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon should sell its asset-
management and processing units, which accounted for 18 percent
of 2011 revenue, and use proceeds for share buybacks. </p>
<p>Eight years is a long time to wait for a higher share
price when the five top executives at JPM from 2004-2010
received over $600 million in compensation, Mayo wrote. </p>
<p>Joe Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment
on the report. The stock gained 6 cents to $38.34 at 11:32 a.m.
in New York. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s net income climbed 9 percent to $19 billion last
year as credit quality improved. Revenue dropped 5 percent to
$97.2 billion, the lowest since 2008. </p>
<p>If JPM is best-of-breed and it still underperforms,
perhaps the breed is not so good or the company needs to better
explain the synergies whose benefits are missing from the share
price, Mayo wrote. </p>

<p>General Maritime Corp. (GMRRQ), the second-
largest U.S. owner of oil tankers, filed an amended
reorganization plan after unsecured creditors objected to its
previous proposal. </p>
<p>The amended plan doesn''t address objections raised Feb. 21
by the official committee of unsecured creditors that the
company failed to explore alternatives to a $175 million equity
investment from Oaktree Capital Management LP, according to
papers filed yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York. </p>
<p>Under the reorganization plan, General Maritime would pay
secured claims in full, reduce debt by $600 million and raise
$61.3 million in a rights offering. The amended plan changes the
rights offering schedule to allow claims as of March 26. </p>
<p>General Maritime, which operates in more than 230 ports of

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will release a Skype

Technologies SA to boost the popularity of its mobile software. </p>
<p>Microsoft plans to have the app available in April, Terry Myerson, head of the Redmond, Washington-based company''s mobile

<p>Microsoft bought Skype to gain customers and enhance its

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank by assets, said about 70 percent of customers with
less than $100,000 in deposits and investments will be
unprofitable following regulations that cap lenders'' fees. </p>
<p>I''m trying to give you a proxy for what the banking
industry has to look forward to if you don''t take into account
business bank clients and getting more of the affluent wealth
wallet, Todd Maclin, chief executive officer of consumer and
business banking at the New York-based company, said today at an
investor presentation. </p>
<p>The biggest U.S. banks are grappling with lost revenue from
regulations that cap debit interchange fees and overdraft
charges, making customers with low deposits more expensive for
lenders to manage. JPMorgan, run by CEO Jamie Dimon, sees its
greatest opportunity with affluent customers that have more
relationships with the company, Maclin said. </p>
<p>Lost revenue has to be replaced with higher share of
wallet and customer penetration, Maclin said. You have to
get your costs and where you spend your time, to the fullest
extent possible, more in line with where the opportunity is. </p>
<p>JPMorgan said there is a significant opportunity to
deepen affluent relationships and a limited opportunity to
deepen relationships with customers who have less than
$100,000 in deposits and investments, according to slides at the
presentation. </p>
<h2>Better Customers'' </h2>
<p>We will see banks pulling out of certain markets, looking
closely at where they have market share, said Bert Ely, an
independent bank consultant based in Alexandria, Virginia. If
you shrink the customer base too much, it will kill the bottom
line. You have to avoid the downward spiral where you try to
drive away customers and trim customers, and you lose your
better customers because they aren''t happy with what you''ve
done. </p>
<p>The Federal Reserve has held interest rates at record lows,
putting pressure on profit margins as banks make less money from
deposits. The Fed has decided to keep the rates near zero
through at least late 2014. </p>
<p>When you are in this interest-rate environment, retail
customers aren''t generating the interest income they used to,
Ely said. The low interest rates would have a negative impact
no matter what happens with regulations. </p>
<h2>Bank of America </h2>
<p>CEO Brian T. Moynihan of Bank of America Corp., the second-
biggest U.S. lender by assets, has said his strategy is to
broaden relationships with the lender''s 8 million so-called
preferred clients that are 1.5 times as profitable as the retail
group. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based company gives these
customers incentives such as removing monthly service fees on
checking accounts for using a Bank of America credit card,
mortgage or Merrill Lynch brokerage account. </p>
<p>Bank of America abandoned a plan to charge some debit-card
users $5 a month for the service after JPMorgan and San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) decided against imposing
similar fees. Citigroup Inc. (C) and U.S. Bancorp (USB) had already
rejected the idea. Maclin said JPMorgan will implement follow-
on pricing for fees in the future. </p>
<p>When the world lets us charge something more akin to your
gym membership or your card, we''ll be right there with them,
he said. In this environment, we''re just not going to rock
that boat, and we have a brand and a franchise where we can make
it up other ways over time. </p>
<h2>Regions Financial </h2>
<p>Regions Financial Corp. (RF), the 10th-largest U.S. bank by
deposits, launched a fee-based service last year that provides
customers with money transfers, bill pay services, check cashing
and reloadable prepaid cards. Since the program started in July,
half of the customers who have started the service were existing
Regions clients and half were new, said John Owen, head of
consumer services group at the Birmingham, Alabama-based lender. </p>
<p>If I can start off by cashing their check or loading a
prepaid card, and then move them into traditional banking, which
means moving them into a savings account or checking account,
that''s what I want to do, Owen said today in a phone
interview. We''re trying to get more people into the banking
system. </p>
<p>Regions would love to take on clients shunned by larger
banks, Owen said. We''ll take all we can get in our 16-state
footprint, he said. </p>
<p>Maclin said it''s possible that fees for checking accounts
could reach $20 one day, which he said the bank would
celebrate. </p>
<h2>Invaluable'' Branches </h2>
<p>JPMorgan''s branches are invaluable to its so-called
affluent customers, according to the presentation slides. The
company said it may open 900 potential new branch buildings
in 2012, especially in California, Florida and Atlanta. </p>
<p>Branches are not that expensive relative to all the
opportunity and the other expenses that we have in running this
place, given our scale, Maclin said. We would acknowledge
with everybody else out there that it is entirely possible that
they could go away one day. If they do, we will make a lot more
money than we''re making right now. Until they do, we''re going to
make sure we''ve got them so no one else can take our location. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) said interest-
rate swaps and credit are among the biggest sources of revenue
in its trading businesses, as it broke with most U.S. rivals by
releasing a breakdown typically kept secret. </p>
<p>JPMorgan generates $375 million from credit trading in a
typical quarter and $350 million each from interest-rate
swaps and foreign-exchange spot and futures trading, the New
York-based bank said today in a presentation to investors. Cash
equities produces about $325 million, while the bank gets $300
million a quarter from asset-backed securities. </p>
<p>While some European banks describe revenue from large units
within their trading divisions, U.S. banks rarely quantify the
makeup of their businesses, which generate about a quarter of
total revenue at the five largest Wall Street banks. JPMorgan
reported $20.2 billion in 2011 trading revenue, which on its own
would make it bigger than U.S. Steel Corp. (X) and Capital One
Financial Corp. (COF) </p>
<p>They are pulling up the hem of their skirt so we can see
a bit more leg, said Gary Townsend, a founder of Hill-Townsend
LLC in Chevy Chase, Maryland, which owns shares of JPMorgan.
They want to make sure the diversity of these operations is
well understood. </p>
<h2>Net Income Target </h2>
<p>Jes Staley, chief executive officer of JPMorgan''s
investment bank, said the bank provided the disclosure in order
to show the breadth of the businesses that contributed to market
share gains. The firm''s 17 percent market share in fixed-income
trading is probably a Wall Street record, he said. The trading-
revenue breakdown was included in slides accompanying his
presentation. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s investment bank is still targeting a 17 percent
return on equity, a measure of profitability, the documents
show. The unit had $467 billion of risk-weighted assets under
Basel 3 as of the fourth quarter and plans to cut that to $413
billion by the end of this year, giving the division a 9.5
percent Tier 1 common ratio. </p>
<p>The bank seeks to eventually produce total net income of
about $24 billion, compared with a record $19 billion last year,
Chief Financial Officer Doug Braunstein said today in a separate
presentation, without specifying a target date. </p>
<h2>Revenue Per Trade </h2>
<p>While less than 0.2 percent of all client trades in the
fixed-income business produced more than $500,000 per
transaction, those accounted for about 25 percent of total
trading revenue. About 98 percent of client trades produced less
than $50,000 per trade in 2011, according to Staley''s
presentation. </p>
<p>Equity swaps and options, which produce about $200 million
a quarter, had the highest revenue-per-trade of the products
listed, at $30,000. Interest-rate swaps produced $12,000 per
transaction, with about 30,000 trades per quarter. Foreign-
exchange spot and forwards generated $70 per trade, while North
American cash equities charged about 1.5 cents per share. </p>
<p>The bank''s description of high-volume products didn''t
account for all of its trading revenue. JPMorgan reported an
average of $3.8 billion from trading in fixed-income products,
currencies and commodities, and $1.2 billion from equities over
the last four quarters. The product revenue listed in the
presentation totaled $2.3 billion in fixed-income and $675
million in equities. </p>
<p>Staley said the disclosure highlighted about 70 percent
of trading revenue. It excluded revenue tied to trading with
other banks, and also didn''t include other areas, such as
structured products, prime brokerage, and net interest income,
he said. </p>
<h2>Volcker Rule </h2>
<p>JPMorgan''s disclosure comes as banks say the proposed U.S.
Volcker rule, which seeks to bar banks from making bets with
their own money, threatens market-making operations and could
hurt liquidity in the marketplace. The breakdown is probably
aimed at informing regulators and may prompt similar moves from
competitors, Townsend said. </p>
<p>We''ve always had an idea as to what their product set is,
but it would be interesting to get more information that would
help make clear how penetrating JPMorgan is in a particular
product area compared to others, Townsend said. Maybe we''ll
get a better sense of that as time goes on. </p>
<p>JPMorgan has about 16,000 clients in its markets business,
according to the presentation. Asset managers accounted for 29
percent of 2011 trading revenue, while hedge funds provided 23
percent and banks 16 percent. More than half of trading revenue
came from North America, with one-third coming from the Europe,
Middle East and Africa region, and 10 percent coming from Asia. </p>
<p>The investment bank employs 2,500 salespeople and 2,000
traders over more than 110 trading desks, the company said. It
also has 2,000 bankers, 800 research analysts, 4,000 control and
risk employees and 13,000 people working on technology and
operations, it said. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon assailed the pay practices of the newspaper
industry today as he sought to deflect criticism of bank pay as
viewed through the compensation ratio. </p>
<p>Obviously our business, in investment banking in
particular, all of our businesses, we have high capital and high
human capital, Dimon said today at a presentation in New York,
where the bank is based. Newspapers -- I went and got this one
day just for fun -- 42 percent payout ratio, which I just think
is just damned outrageous. </p>
<p>Lawmakers and journalists have criticized bankers for the
size of their salaries and bonuses and regulators have blamed
compensation for fueling the financial crisis. Dimon, who runs
the biggest and most profitable U.S. bank, previously cited the
media industry during a January investor call in which he sought
to show why using compensation payout ratios is wrongheaded. </p>
<p>JPMorgan paid the 25,999 employees in the investment bank
an average of $341,552 last year, or about 34 percent of the
unit''s revenue, according to figures posted Jan. 13. </p>
<p>Worse than that, you don''t even make any money! Dimon
said, directing his comments to those in the media covering the
company''s investor day and drawing laughter from his audience.
We pay 35 percent. We make a lot of money. JPMorgan posted
$19 billion in profit last year. </p>
<p>Gannett Co., the McLean, Virginia-based media company that
produces 82 daily publications including USA Today, earned $518 million
last year. The stock has dropped 8.7 percent in the past year,
while JPMorgan has fallen 16 percent. Since the end of 2007,
Gannett is down 61 percent, while JPMorgan is off 10 percent. </p>
<p>Newspapers do make money and they are still quite
profitable, many operating with double-digit margins, said
Randy Bennett, a spokesman at the Newspaper Association of
America. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world''s largest computer-services provider, fired
more than 1,000 workers in North America this week, according to
an employee advocacy group. </p>
<p>The job reductions are mostly in the U.S., with some in
Canada, said Lee Conrad, national coordinator of Alliance@IBM,
which has been trying to organize IBM employees. The group is
continuing to update the number as it receives severance
documents from workers notified with what IBM calls resource
actions, Conrad said. Redundant employees may apply for other
positions within IBM, the documents show. </p>
<p>Doug Shelton, a spokesman for Armonk, New York-based IBM,
declined to provide a number, citing company policy and the
competitive nature of our business. </p>
<p>The cuts would represent about 0.2 percent of IBM''s global
workforce, which totaled 433,362 at the end of 2011, according
to the annual report filed today with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. The company stopped providing a geographic
breakdown of its employees in 2009. At the end of 2008, U.S.
staff accounted for 115,000 of its 398,455 employees, according
to its annual report that year. </p>
<p>IBM is constantly rebalancing its workforce, Shelton
said today. That means reducing in some areas and hiring in
others -- based on shifts in technology and client demand. This
allows IBM to remain competitive and relevant in an industry
that is constantly changing. </p>
<p>IBM rose less than 1 percent to $197.98 at the close in New
York. The shares have gained 7.7 percent this year. </p>
<p>Alliance@IBM is affiliated with the Communications Workers
of America and is seeking union recognition at IBM. </p>
<p>Information Week reported yesterday that more than 250 jobs
had been cut at IBM. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) released the first
broadly available test version of the Windows 8 operating
system, giving consumers an early peek at software designed to
rival the touch-enabled features on Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s iPad. </p>
<p>The so-called Consumer Preview is available for download
from Microsoft''s website. The Redmond, Washington-based company
demonstrated the software, which lets users store applications
in the Internet-based cloud in order to easily switch between
computers and Windows Phones, in a two-hour session at the
Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona, Spain, today. </p>
<p>Revenue from Windows software, which runs most of the
world''s personal computers, has missed analysts'' estimates in
four of the past five quarters, in part because some consumers
are defecting from laptops with Windows to tablets. Microsoft
probably won''t be able to significantly change that trend until
Windows 8 goes on sale, Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein said
in an interview last month. </p>
<p>Julie Larson-Green, a Microsoft vice president, showed off
the software''s tile design and the ease of switching between
different applications on a tablet computer. The program allows
users to pin people to the Windows start screen to
communicate and maintain important contacts. Larson-Green also
demonstrated how the software allows live video to run within an
instant-messaging app. </p>
<p>Windows 8 is really fast, fluid and responsive,
Windows President Steven Sinofsky said today. It''s really an
operating system for a new generation. </p>
<h2>Windows App Store </h2>
<p>The company has declined to say when Windows 8 will be
officially released, although analysts expect it later this
year. Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) has said it plans to introduce a
tablet based on the new software some time before the end of
2012. </p>
<p>Users have the option of signing in to a Windows account,
which lets them connect to their information stored in an
Internet-based cloud on multiple personal computers and Windows
Phones. This lets them access e-mail and calendars, take apps
and settings with them when they switch PCs and lets them use
cloud storage, the company said in a statement. </p>
<p>The release of the test version also marks the opening of
the Windows app store. Applications will be free during the
Consumer Preview period. </p>
<p>The operating system marks the first time Microsoft will
release a version of Windows for PCs that also runs on chips
with ARM Holdings Plc (ARM)''s technology. Those are the kind of
processors that dominate the tablet market, giving those
machines better speed and battery life. </p>
<h2>X86 Version </h2>
<p>The test version available for download is the x86 version
of Windows that will run the rival chips from Intel Corp. (INTC) and
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) The ARM-based systems will get a
narrower test audience, with Microsoft distributing thousands of
them shortly, Sinofsky said in an interview earlier this month. </p>
<p>The ARM version of Windows will only be sold pre-installed
on a computer or tablet and won''t run applications written for
older versions of Windows, while the x86 product will run
existing applications and can be sold separately, Sinofsky said. </p>
<p>Microsoft released an earlier preview of the program,
designed for software developers writing apps for Windows, in
September. Since them the team has made over 100,000 changes to
the product, Sinofsky said today. </p>
<p>Microsoft fell 0.4 percent to $31.74 at the close in New
York. The shares have gained 22 percent this year. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS), two of the largest derivatives dealers, posted
identical gross notional amounts of credit-default swaps bought
and sold on five troubled European nations. </p>
<p>JPMorgan purchased single-name contracts protecting $147.3
billion of debt and sold $142.4 billion related to the so-called
GIIPS nations of Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, the
bank said in its annual filing today. Goldman Sachs disclosed
the exact same figures in a filing yesterday. In both cases, the
numbers were as of Dec. 31. </p>
<p>Banks, facing regulatory pressure to more thoroughly
explain risks posed by countries at the center of Europe''s debt
crisis, are beginning to provide specific gross notional figures
for credit derivatives. The disclosures show the extent to which
firms have insured debt from those nations, and their efforts to
balance that exposure by buying protection. </p>
<p>There are a nearly infinite number of possible
coincidences that could occur any day of the year but don''t,
said Chris Kotowski, an analyst at Oppenheimer  Co. in New
York. Every now and then, they do. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is the largest U.S. credit-derivative dealer, and
Goldman Sachs is No. 3. The notional amounts represented about 7
percent of Goldman Sachs'' total credit derivatives, and 5
percent of JPMorgan''s total. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs previously reported only its so-called funded
exposure to the debt of those nations, excluding commitments or
contingent payments such as credit-default swaps. JPMorgan had
provided net figures. </p>
<h2>In Agreement </h2>
<p>Top risk managers for the two firms sat next to each other
today at a panel discussion organized by a trade group in New
York. David Weisbrod, vice chairman of risk management at
JPMorgan, and Craig Broderick, Goldman Sachs''s chief risk
officer, repeatedly agreed with each other''s statements during
the discussion of new challenges in risk management at the
annual convention of the Global Association of Risk
Professionals. Broderick worked for Chase Manhattan Bank, now
part of JPMorgan, before joining Goldman Sachs, according to the
association''s convention booklet. </p>
<p>JPMorgan said master netting agreements reduced the
notional amount of protection purchased to $18.5 billion and the
amount sold to $13.7 billion. The fair value of the contracts
after collateral and netting were $3.9 billion and $2.7 billion,
respectively. </p>
<h2>Citigroup, BofA </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs also said that legally enforceable netting
agreements would reduce the amount of credit-default swaps
purchased on the five countries to $21.1 billion and the amount
sold to $16.2 billion. Those so-called notional amounts exclude
collateral as well as derivatives from outside those nations
that could mitigate the risk, according to the filing. Both
banks are based in New York. </p>
<p>Citigroup Inc. (C) said the net notional amount of swaps it
purchased on the GIIPS nations was $16.9 billion, and the net
amount sold was $7.8 billion. It didn''t provide gross figures.
Bank of America Corp. also didn''t disclose notional amounts
related to those nations. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), the second-largest credit derivative dealer
among U.S. banks, included net notional amounts of credit-
default swaps within its net inventory category, which also
comprised long and short positions in debt and equity securities
tied to the region. </p>

of mortgage-backed securities. </p>
<p>JPMorgan said in a filing today that the Securities and
Exchange Commission warned in January it may bring complaints
stemming from two investigations into mortgage securitizations.
Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo also said yesterday they received
so-called Wells notices from the SEC, warning that agency staff
may recommend enforcement. </p>
<p>It''s a big deal given the level of anticipation that has
been in the markets about whether there would be further
actions, said Jacob Frenkel, a former SEC lawyer now with
Shulman Rogers Gandal Pordy  Ecker PA in Potomac, Maryland.
These cases were complicated and time-consuming and the
government has said for a long time that its investigations were
continuing. </p>
<p>The SEC has issued such notices to multiple banks in probes
focusing on mortgage securities, said people with knowledge of
the matter who asked not to be identified because the
communications weren''t public. </p>
<p>Almost four years after mounting mortgage defaults prompted
unprecedented government bailouts of the financial system,
regulators are still examining how banks packaged and sold home
loans to investors. The SEC is looking for evidence that firms
failed to disclose underlying credit weaknesses in mortgage
pools and delinquencies, Jason Anthony, special counsel for the
agency''s structured products unit, said last week. He didn''t
identify companies under scrutiny. </p>
<h2>Goldman Sachs </h2>
<p>JPMorgan said one inquiry focuses on due diligence and
disclosures in two securitizations by a subsidiary. The other
probe relates to settlements of claims against originators
involving loans included in securitizations handled by Bear
Stearns Cos., which JPMorgan acquired in 2008, according to the
filing. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs got a Wells notice Feb. 24 relating to
disclosures for a late-2006 offering of $1.3 billion in subprime
residential mortgage-backed securities, the company said in an
annual report. The New York-based firm said it will be making
a submission to, and intends to engage in a dialogue with, the
SEC staff seeking to address their concerns. </p>
<h2>Fair Lending </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs paid $550 million in 2010 to settle SEC
claims that it misled investors on a mortgage-linked investment
in 2007. In that case, the company said it made a mistake in
omitting disclosures. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo, which revealed the SEC''s warning in an annual
report yesterday, said the government has been examining whether
it properly described facts and risks in offering documents. </p>
<p>The notices show SEC enforcement staff concluded that
violations occurred, Frenkel said. John Nester, a spokesman for
the agency, declined to comment on the investigations. </p>
<p>Government agencies are also looking at whether San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo may have violated fair-lending laws
or other regulations when making home loans, the firm said. </p>
<p>The SEC said in January it will help form a state and
federal working group that will share information and coordinate
inquiries involving residential mortgage-backed securities. </p>
<p>We already have issued scores of subpoenas, analyzed more
than approximately 25 million pages of documents, dozens and
dozens of witnesses, and worked with our industry experts to
analyze the terms of these deals and the accuracy of the
disclosures made to investors, the agency''s enforcement
director, Robert Khuzami, said at the time. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo was among five mortgage servicers that agreed
this month to a $25 billion settlement of state and federal
probes into shoddy foreclosure practices. The deal allowed
regulators to continue pursuing the industry over claims
regarding the packaging of loans into securities. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS)''s top trading
executives for Latin America, Marcio Rochwerger and Igor Mansour, left the company last month after being bought out, two
people familiar with the matter said. </p>
<p>Rochwerger ran equity trading and was president of the New
York-based company''s brokerage unit in Brazil, according to the
people, who declined to be identified because the departures
haven''t been announced. Mansour was responsible for fixed-income
and foreign-exchange trading in the region, the people said.
They were both based in Sao Paulo. </p>
<p>Daniel Goldberg left his position in July as president of
Morgan Stanley''s Brazil business to start investment firm FKG
Capital Gestao de Recursos Ltda. in a partnership with Farallon
Capital Management LLC. Morgan Stanley (JEF) has 205 employees in
Brazil and 35 in Mexico, excluding secretaries, Christopher Harland, the head of the bank in Latin America, said Feb. 23. </p>
<p>Under the buyout agreement, Rochwerger and Mansour can''t
accept any work offer until April, the people said. Morgan
Stanley''s trading businesses lost money on 64 days last year,
compared with 38 days in 2010, according to a regulatory filing
on Feb. 27. </p>
<p>Mary Claire Delaney, a spokeswoman for the New York-based
bank, declined to comment on the departures. </p>

<p> Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world''s
largest software maker, said it will increase advertising
spending to build market share for Windows Phone as it drives
into new regions. </p>
<p>The next year to 18 months is really about seeing a
significant uptake in market share, Aaron Woodman, the
director of Windows Phone, said in an interview at the Mobile
World Congress in Barcelona. Microsoft previously focused on
getting publicity and good reviews for the system, he said. </p>
<p>Microsoft handset partners led by Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) sold about
2.8 million Windows Phones in the fourth quarter for a
1.9 percent market share in smartphones, according to Gartner
Inc. The software maker needs to peddle tens of millions of
units a quarter to make its mobile software a durable contender
alongside Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s iPhone and Google Inc. (GOOG)''s Android. </p>
<p>It doesn''t feel like we''re really pushing apart from the
competition, Woodman said. We need to go pick a fight. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s rallying cry will be that Windows Phone helps
users do what they want to do faster than handsets with other
operating systems, he said. Over the next six months, the
Redmond, Washington-based company will expand its Smoked by
Windows Phone campaign, in which users race handsets to
accomplish tasks through various digital and video media. </p>
<p>We''ll do TV spots, the question is where, Woodman said.
Microsoft is patient and willing to use deep pockets, but
we''re also respectful of shareholder value so we want to pick
appropriate countries and spend levels. He declined to specify
an advertising budget. </p>
<h2>China Entry </h2>
<p>Entering markets with lower smartphone penetration, such as
China, could help Microsoft build volume. That requires cheaper
handsets that are starting to come to market. Nokia broke the
200-euro mark with the 189-euro ($254) Lumia 610 this week. ZTE
Corp. (000063) also introduced a cheaper Windows Phone, the ZTE Orbit. </p>
<p>We''re getting demand from handset makers and operators to
expand geographically more quickly than we originally thought,
Woodman said. In China, people are now able to afford data
cost, they''re pretty comfortable with that price point of the
Lumia 610, so there''s still significant volume. </p>
<p>Microsoft is opening mobile applications stores in China,
Thailand, Venezuela and 20 other nations by the end of the
month, with phones arriving around the same time, Terry Myerson,
who oversees the Windows Phone business, said this week. That
will bring the total number of markets Microsoft serves to 63,
letting it target 60 percent more buyers, he said. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Co SA (EEEK),
the world''s second-biggest bottler of Coke beverages, will cut
its production plants in Greece to three from five as the
recession hits revenue in the country. </p>

affect 30 employees, according to the e-mail. </p>
<p>The Greek economy is in its fifth year of recession and the

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s (JPM) pipeline of
clients from China seeking financing overseas has doubled from a
year ago to a record, led by developers seeking funds, said the
head of its China investment banking business. </p>
<p>We saw a level of activity that we''ve never seen in the
past by property companies tapping offshore debt markets, Fang
Fang, who is also managing director and Asia vice chairman for
New York-based JPMorgan, said in an interview yesterday. He
declined to provide specific figures. We are seeing the return
of the equity investor as well. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. lender by assets, is among banks
benefiting from a revival in overseas fundraising by China''s
largest developers, who aim to ease a cash crunch as home prices
drop and the government maintains curbs on the property market.
Last month, JPMorgan was among banks that arranged a $500
million bond sale by China Overseas Land  Investment Ltd. (688) </p>
<p>The U.S. bank''s ties to China go back to 1911, when it led
a syndicate in managing a railway company''s $7.5 million bond
sale. In 1921, Equitable Eastern Banking Corp., one of
JPMorgan''s predecessor firms, opened a Shanghai branch,
according to the lender''s website. </p>
<h2>Lagging Behind Rivals </h2>
<p>JPMorgan began offering investment banking services in
China in the middle of last year after tying with First Capital
Securities Co. (FISCPZ) as a joint-venture partner in March 2010. That
puts it behind rivals such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which in
2004 became the first Wall Street firm to firm to win an
underwriting license in China, and Zurich-based UBS AG, which
began operations on the mainland in 2006. </p>

<p>In the new Walt Disney Co. (DIS) film
John Carter, a Civil War veteran transported to Mars fights
giant saber-toothed apes and four-armed, sword-wielding aliens. </p>
<p>Things are only a little less scary here on earth, where
the pricey picture -- researcher Box Office Mojo pegs its cost
at about $250million, not counting marketing -- is already
battling bad buzz, reports of cost overruns, and criticism of
Disney''s early marketing. </p>
<p>Hollywood studios in recent years have made fewer, more
expensive films that can spawn sequels and become long-lived
franchises. When it works, the payoff is big: The Harry Potter
string of eight films has brought in $7.7billion at the box
office. For every Toy Story, there''s a The Adventures of
Pluto Nash, which made back less than a 10th its estimated
$100million budget through ticket sales, Bloomberg Businessweek
reports in its March 5 edition. </p>
<p>John Carter is also a test of whether Burbank,
California-based Disney can spread the magic of animation
powerhouse Pixar, which it acquired in 2006 for $7.01billion,
to live-action films. </p>
<p>Andrew Stanton, the writer and director of John Carter,
previously co-wrote and directed Pixar hits Finding Nemo and
WALL-E, for which he won Academy Awards. He was a writer on
Monsters, Inc. and all three Toy Story movies. While
John Carter isn''t just different because it uses real
actors, it''s more costly than any of Stanton''s previous films. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) said it
fundamentally disagrees with an advisory group''s criticism
of its pay practices and the process for naming Chief Executive
Officer Robert Iger to the added role of chairman. </p>
<p>Institutional Shareholder Services, which consults on
governance issues, has recommended voting against members of
Disney''s governance and nominating committee and criticized the
compensation of Iger, the Burbank, California-based company said
today in regulatory filings. </p>
<p>The company accused ISS of second-guessing its independent
directors and urged shareholders to back the board''s decisions.
The filings are designed to bolster support for Disney ahead of
the March 13 annual meeting, when all 10 board nominees will be
up for re-election, including four ISS opposes. </p>
<p>Disney fundamentally disagrees with certain of ISS''s
recommendations, which are based on both flawed premises and
methodology, the company said in a statement. </p>
<p>The October decision to make Iger chairman when John Pepper
steps down this month represents an about-face from reforms
adopted in 2004 when then-chairman Michael Eisner relinquished
the title under pressure from shareholders, ISS said. </p>
<p>We are not second-guessing the board''s rationale for
choosing to recombine the roles, or its right to do so, ISS
said in a Feb. 29 report. We are highlighting concerns with
the process underlying the board''s action, which reversed an
earlier commitment to independent board leadership without
transparency or shareholder input. </p>
<h2>CEO Pay </h2>
<p>Iger''s pay has climbed to $30 million from $17.3 million
over a six-year period, ISS said in the 28-page document. While
Disney increased the dividend by 50 percent last year, an
investment of $100 in the stock five years ago was worth only
$105 at the end of fiscal 2011, the group said. </p>
<p>The ISS assertion that Disney reversed a commitment to
independent board leadership without conducting outreach to
shareholders beforehand is false, the company said, adding no
such pledge existed. </p>
<p>The company lived up to its commitment by explaining the
decision and appointing an independent lead director, according
to the filing. Iger''s pay is entirely in line with that of
its media peers that include CBS Corp. (CBS), News Corp. (NWSA), Time Warner
Inc. (TWX), Viacom Inc. and Comcast Corp. (CMCSA), the company said. </p>
<p>Disney also said a $100 investment made when Iger took over
in October 2005 had appreciated to $171 as of year-end, while
comparable companies returned no more than $136. </p>
<p>Disney rose 1 percent to $42.39 at the close of trading in
New York. The stock has gained 13 percent this year. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Bristol-Myers Squibb
Co.''s new blood-thinning pill Eliquis has had its review by U.S.
regulators delayed by three months. </p>
<p>The delay is from additional data the two companies
submitted, Bristol-Myers said in a statement last night. The new
data is a major amendment to the application and will require
additional time for review, the drugmaker said. </p>
<p>The medicine will be sold by the two New York-based
companies to prevent stroke and embolisms in patients with
atrial fibrillation, or an irregular heartbeat. The drugmakers
will split sales from the pill, which Tim Anderson, an analyst
with Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in New York, estimates at $2.5
billion a year by 2015. </p>
<p>A small delay in the approval of Eliquis would not be
terribly material to either Bristol-Myers (BMY) or Pfizer in our view,
and FDA delays with new drugs are certainly not an uncommon
occurrence, Anderson wrote yesterday in a note to clients, in
which he predicted the delay. However, this could cut into
analyst sales forecasts slightly. </p>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration now aims to rule on
the drug by June 28, Bristol-Myers said in the statement, from a
late March deadline. If approved by the FDA, Eliquis will
compete with Xarelto, sold by Bayer AG (BAYN) and Johnson  Johnson,
and Pradaxa, sold by Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH (BING). </p>
<p>There aren''t plans for the FDA to convene an advisory
committee to rule on the drug, according to the statement. </p>
<p>Bristol-Myers rose 1.5 percent to $32.64 at the close of New
York trading. Pfizer climbed 1.7 percent to $21.49. </p>

<p>General Maritime Corp. (GMR), the second-
largest U.S. owner of oil tankers reorganizing in bankruptcy,
reported a net loss of $63.7 million for the month ended Jan.
31. </p>
<p>The net loss since its Nov. 17 bankruptcy filing is $103.5
million, and total assets are $1.67 billion, according to the
operating report filed in Manhattan bankruptcy court yesterday.
Assets include cash of $15 million and vessels valued at $1.5
billion. </p>
<p>On Feb. 28, the New York-based company won provisional
court approval to reorganize even as a bankruptcy judge told
creditors to prepare their evidence for an expected fight over
final approval of a Chapter 11 plan. The proposed terms will
cancel all of General Maritime''s old stock and give all the
stock in a new company to Oaktree Capital Management LP (OAKTRZ). </p>
<p>Reorganization costs made up the bulk of the company''s
expenses, at $54 million, including a $44.9 million write-off of
a discount on its Oaktree credit facility and another $7.6
million related to deferred financing costs on the debt. </p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn overruled most
objections from a committee of unsecured creditors at the Feb.
28 hearing, and said they can pursue their arguments at a final
hearing on the plan in April. Unsecured creditors had objected
to the plan, saying Oaktree had a deal with the company locked
up and that the reorganization proposal wasn''t made in good
faith, citing a long relationship between Oaktree and General
Maritime Chairman Peter Georgiopoulos. </p>
<p>General Maritime operates in more than 230 ports of call in
more than 70 countries. The company listed assets of $1.71
billion and debt of $1.41 billion in its Chapter 11 petition in
November. </p>
<p>The case is In re General Maritime Corp., 11-15285, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Four banks charged with defrauding
Milan with derivatives offered to unwind the swap at a discount
and pay the city its profit from the transaction under a
proposed settlement with the municipality. </p>
<p>According to a draft agreement drawn up by the city
administration, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), UBS AG (UBSN), Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)
and Depfa Bank Plc will reverse the deal for 63 million euros
($84 million). The banks will cut that fee to 23 million euros
and pay Milan its 476 million-euro mark-to-market gain on the
swap, according to the papers seen by Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>In return, Milan will drop its claims for damages from the
banks a prosecutor accuses of tricking the city into buying the
swaps by hiding the fees they reaped from the trade. The banks
won''t admit any responsibility as part of the settlement on the
30-year swaps, and will ask a court to return funds seized
during the criminal proceedings, the document shows. The
agreement is pending final approval by both sides. </p>
<p>A transaction of this kind eliminates the financial
damages that the banks might have to pay if they were convicted,
and it may lessen the sanctions that could include being barred
from doing business with certain clients, said Alessio Lanzi,
a criminal lawyer in Milan, who is not involved in the case. </p>
<p>The government is satisfied with the reduction in
costs, according to the document. Officials for the city
declined to comment, as did spokeswomen for UBS, Deutsche Bank,
JPMorgan and a spokesman for Depfa. </p>
<h2>Hidden Fees </h2>
<p>The lenders charged 101 million euros in fees for arranging
the derivatives that adjusted payments on the city''s 1.7
billion-euro bond offering in 2005 and from subsequent
restructurings, according to city prosecutor Alfredo Robledo.
That the fees weren''t disclosed makes them fraudulent, he said
as he secured charges against the banks in March 2010. </p>
<p>The banks said in court that firms don''t typically disclose
what they''re charging municipalities to arrange swaps, tailored
trades that lack comparable market prices. </p>
<p>Every time I sold a derivative to a public
administration, even before getting to the details, the first
question was always, How does the bank make money?'' Antonia Creanza, a JPMorgan Chase banker, told the court in September
under questioning by her lawyer. I would explain that we would
retain a margin. Never has a legal adviser told me, Look you
need to detail the gross margin,'' she said. </p>
<p>Under the agreement, the city will commit to not describe
the deal as the reimbursement of the alleged implicit costs
of the original transactions, and the banks will drop a suit at
the High Court in London. </p>
<h2>Reasonable Rate'' </h2>
<p>The firms say raising the cash to fund the payment to Milan
will cost about 53 million euros, according to the document. The
other costs are linked to hedging the swaps. UBS expects to
charge the least, at 8.9 million euros, and Deutsche Bank, at
24.5 million euros, the most. </p>
<p>The costs reflect a funding gap for which the banks
appear to be charging at a reasonable rate, said Jacopo Ceccatelli, founder of JC  Associati SIM, a Milan-based
financial advisory firm. </p>
<p>Milan plans to place about 138 million euros of the cash it
will receive from the banks in U.K. deposit accounts with the
four firms on which it will earn interest equal to 3-month
Euribor, the filing shows. </p>
<p>The city will also invest about 275 million euros in
Italian government bonds which it will be free to buy through
other intermediaries, according to a person with knowledge of
the settlement proposal who declined to be identified because
the agreement isn''t final. </p>
<p>The cash and bonds will be pledged as guarantees for swaps
that the municipality still retains with the banks. Milan sold
the banks a credit-default swap on Italy, a transaction on which
the city is losing about 206 million euros, the filing shows. </p>
<p>The municipality, which claimed that it had relied on the
banks'' advice in arranging the swaps in 2005, says it''s now
acting independently based on its own assessment of the risks,
according to the term sheet. The city will seek prior approval
from the Treasury. </p>

<p>A U.S. investigation of possible
insider-trading by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) employees expanded
to include a managing director whose name emerged at the trial
of convicted hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam, a person with
knowledge of the probe said. </p>
<p>David Loeb, who works on Asia equity sales in New York and

<h2>New Suits </h2>
<h2>Kinder Morgan''s El Paso Buyout Deal Allowed by Judge to Proceed </h2>
<p>Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMI) was allowed to proceed with a $21.1
billion takeover of El Paso Corp. (EP) by a judge who rejected claims
that Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s conflict of interest in the deal
warranted blocking a shareholder vote. </p>
<p>Delaware Chancery Court Judge Leo Strine rejected calls by
some El Paso shareholders to block rival pipeline operator
Kinder Morgan''s $25.91-a-share offer. El Paso didn''t negotiate a
high enough price and Goldman Sachs, which owns 19 percent of
Kinder Morgan, wrongfully served as adviser to El Paso on the
deal and improperly influenced negotiations, they argued. </p>
<p>I reluctantly deny the plaintiffs'' motion for a
preliminary injunction, concluding that the El Paso stockholders
should not be deprived of the chance to decide for themselves
about the merger, despite the disturbing nature of some of the
behavior leading to its terms, Strine ruled yesterday. </p>
<p>El Paso shareholders are scheduled to vote on the offer
March 6. </p>
<p>The role of New York-based Goldman Sachs on both sides of
the deal was the focal point of the Wilmington case. Pension
funds from Louisiana, Florida and New York that invested in El
Paso argued Goldman Sachs, the fifth-largest U.S. bank by
assets, has long-standing ties to Kinder Morgan and helped
Richard Kinder, the firm''s chief executive officer, take the
pipeline operator private in 2006. </p>
<p>We''re gratified that the judge denied the injunction and
that we can proceed with the vote of the shareholders, Larry
Pierce, a spokesman for Kinder Morgan, said in an e-mail
yesterday. </p>
<p>El Paso officials are looking forward to the close of the
transaction with Kinder Morgan, company spokesman Richard
Wheatley said in a phone interview. </p>
<p>We are pleased that shareholders will get to vote on the
merger, David Wells, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, said in an e-mail. We respect the judge''s opinion but
want to be clear that we stood by our client through this
process, encouraging them to get independent views from another
adviser. We were also transparent with El Paso about our
relationship with Kinder Morgan and the related issues. </p>
<p>The pension funds contended in their suit that Goldman
Sachs had a financial incentive to advise El Paso''s managers to
accept a lower price than they might have negotiated. Kinder''s
cash-and-stock bid amounts to a 37 percent premium to El Paso
shareholders, according to the company. </p>
<p>Goldman''s staggering conflict of interest was obvious
from the outset: With a stake in KMI worth over $4 billion,
every dollar shaved off the buyout price represented $150
million of savings for Goldman, the funds argued. </p>

<h2>Morgan Stanley Mortgage Capital Sued for Breach of Contract </h2>
<p>A Morgan Stanley (MS) unit was sued for breach of contract by a
securitization trust seeking to force the bank to buy back about
$300 million in mortgage loans. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley Mortgage Capital failed to comply with the
terms of agreements governing the sale of about 5,400 mortgage
loans with a total unpaid principal balance of about $300
million, trustee U.S. Bank NA said in a complaint filed
yesterday on the trust''s behalf in New York State Supreme Court
in Manhattan. </p>
<p>The loans began to default or become delinquent at a
significant rate shortly after they were sold to the trust,
which has suffered losses of $140.7 million as of Feb. 25,
according to court papers. The trust seeks $142 million in
damages. </p>
<p>The plaintiff has been informed of numerous breaches of
representations and warranties made by MSMC that related to the
quality of the mortgage loans, U.S. Bank said. MSMC has
failed to cure these breaches or repurchase the loans. </p>
<p>Mary Claire Delaney, a spokeswoman for New York-based
Morgan Stanley, declined to comment on the lawsuit. </p>
<p>The case is Morgan Stanley Mortgage Loan Trust 2006-4SL and
Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2006-4SL v. Morgan
Stanley Mortgage Capital, 650579/2012, New York State Supreme
Court (Manhattan.) </p>
<h2>Doctors Among 36 Charged in $275 Million Insurance Scheme </h2>
<p>Thirty-six people, including 10 doctors and three lawyers,
were charged in a no-fault auto insurance scheme that made more
than $275 million. </p>
<p>The ring, which consisted mostly of Russian-born U.S.
residents, used medical fraud mills, phony clinics that
billed insurers for unnecessary treatments, according to the
indictment. </p>
<p>Lawyers connected to the scheme filed fraudulent personal
injury claims and suits to make additional money, the government
said in the indictment. Charges against participants in the
alleged scheme include racketeering conspiracy, health-care
fraud conspiracy, conspiracy to commit mail fraud and conspiracy
to launder money. </p>
<p>New York law requires vehicles registered in the state to
carry no-fault insurance providing as much as $50,000 per person
to cover injuries sustained in auto accidents, according to the
government. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Zemlyansky, 12-CR-171, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<h2>Drilling Rig Manager Charged With Lying About Blowout Tests </h2>
<p>Donald Hudson, who was a manager at Helmerich  Payne Inc. (HP),
was charged with lying to a federal agent reviewing blowout
prevention testing and records of drilling rigs in the Gulf of
Mexico. </p>
<p>Hudson, 49, lied to an investigator with the U.S.
Department of Interior''s inspector general office when he denied
directing others to falsify blowout prevention testing records,
U.S. Attorney Jim Letten in New Orleans said yesterday in a
statement. </p>
<p>Prosecutors said Hudson was employed by Helmerich  Payne
as a drilling rig manager aboard Rig 206 in May 2010, during a
period of heightened vigilance on oil rigs following the deadly
blowout that killed 11 crew members aboard the Deepwater Horizon
operated by BP Plc (BP/) -- an unrelated incident that triggered the
nation''s worst offshore oil spill. </p>
<p>In May 2011, the company said in a regulatory filing that
it suspended operations on an offshore rig after an employee
reported possible testing irregularities. The Tulsa,
Oklahoma-based company told stockholders that operations on the
rig were promptly suspended, federal authorities were
alerted, and certain employees were fired for violating
company policies and procedures. </p>
<p>The company said it was cooperating with a grand jury
investigation of the matter. </p>
<p>Hudson''s attorney, Steven Lemoine of New Orleans, declined
to comment on the charges. </p>
<p>Steven R. Mackey, vice president and general counsel of
Helmerich  Payne Inc., didn''t immediately respond to an e-mail
seeking comment on the charges against Hudson. </p>
<h2>Swiss Bank Employee Offered Stolen Hyposwiss Client Account Data </h2>
<p>Swiss authorities arrested a man suspected of stealing data
from Hyposwiss Privatbank AG and offering it for sale, public
prosecutors said yesterday. </p>
<p>Prosecutors opened an investigation on Jan. 19 after they
were alerted by a law firm that was offered the data, Jeannette
Balmer, a prosecution spokeswoman said, in an e-mail. A former
external Hyposwiss employee was arrested on Feb. 16 and
remains in custody, she said, without providing the name. </p>
<p>The stolen data relate to a dispute between Russian
billionaires Oleg Deripaska and Vladimir Potanin, according to a
report in Handelszeitung newspaper yesterday. Swiss prosecutors
have dismissed allegations by Deripaska that Potanin and Hans
Bodmer, a lawyer who resigned from Hyposwiss''s board in
November, used offshore accounts to move money from MMC Norilsk
Nickel OJSC. (GMKN) </p>
<p>The requested price for the data was 2 million francs
($2.23 million), the Swiss newspaper said. </p>
<p>We can confirm that a former employee of Hyposwiss has
been arrested, said a St. Galler Kantonalbank spokesman, Simon
Netzle, adding that the bank remained in contact with
prosecutors. Hyposwiss is owned by St. Galler. </p>
<p>Neither the bank nor the prosecutors commented on whether
the arrest relates to the dispute between the Russians. </p>

<h2>CIFG, Syncora Can''t Bring New Claims Against Loan Originator </h2>
<p>CIFG Assurance North America Inc. and Syncora Guarantee
Inc. can''t bring new claims against a loan originator over the
quality of $1.8 billion of home-equity loans they guaranteed, a
judge ruled. </p>
<p>New York State Supreme Court Justice Bernard J. Fried on
Feb. 24 denied a motion by the insurers to amend their complaint
against GreenPoint Mortgage Funding Inc., saying that the new
claims are based on documents that were already filed in the

which accused the loan originator of violating its mortgage-
underwriting guidelines. </p>

<h2>Stanford Jurors Weigh U.S. Claim He Used Bank as Personal ATM </h2>
<p>R. Allen Stanford flushed investor money away on
failing businesses, yachts and cricket tournaments, prosecutors
told jurors who began deliberations on whether the Texas
financier led a massive Ponzi scheme. </p>
<p>If Stanford''s customers knew what he was really doing with
their money, they wouldn''t have bought certificates of deposit
issued by his Antigua bank, Justice Department lawyer William
Stellmach said in Houston federal court yesterday at the close
of the financier''s five-week fraud trial. </p>
<p>The truth is that he flushed it away, Stellmach said.
He told depositors he was using their money in one way and the
truth was completely different. </p>
<p>Stanford, 61, is accused of leading a $7 billion scheme
funded through the sale of CDs issued by Stanford International
Bank Ltd. Some of the CDs were sold in the U.S. by the Houston-
based securities firm, Stanford Group Co. He faces 14 criminal
counts, including mail fraud and wire fraud, that each carry
maximum sentences of 20 years in prison. </p>
<p>His attorneys rested their case Feb. 27 without Stanford
taking the stand. In his closing argument, defense lawyer Ali
Fazel said there was no deceit and this man is not guilty. </p>

<h2>Mattel Asks Appeals Court to Reverse $310 Million MGA Award </h2>
<p>Mattel Inc. (MAT) asked a federal appeals court to reverse the
$310 million in damages and fees that toymaker MGA Entertainment
Inc. won last year in a trial over ownership of the rights to
MGA''s Bratz dolls. </p>
<p>Mattel said in a brief filed Feb. 27 with the U.S. Court of
Appeals in San Francisco that after two trials and eight years
of litigation, it isn''t contesting the jury''s finding that MGA
didn''t infringe Mattel''s copyright when it developed the dolls
from an idea and drawings by a former Mattel designer. </p>
<p>The El Segundo, California-based maker of the Barbie doll
said it wants the appeals court to throw out the $172.5 million
MGA won on its counterclaims that Mattel stole its trade
secrets. Those claims were time-barred and shouldn''t have been
brought to trial, Mattel said. Nor was there evidence that the
alleged trade secrets were actually secrets, it said. </p>
<p>MGA failed to prove on a trade-secret-by-trade-secret
basis that the 26 products on which the jury found liability and
damages were trade secrets, adducing at best only vague and
general proof that MGA protected the secrecy of some of the
products it displayed at toy fairs for publicity purposes,
Mattel said. </p>
<p>The company asked the court to reverse what it called the
unprecedented $105.6 million in attorneys'' fees and $31.6
million in costs U.S. District Judge David O. Carter in Santa
Ana, California, awarded to MGA for having to defend against
Mattel''s copyright-infringement suit. </p>
<p>I''m pleased that Mattel and its board of directors, after
wasting $400 million of shareholders'' money in a lawsuit they
should have never brought, have now abandoned that and the
ownership of the Bratz brand belongs to MGA, Isaac Larian,
chief executive officer and founder of Van Nuys, California-
based MGA, said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>As for the damages for their crimes against MGA, as well
as 40 other toy companies, and the legal fees, I am confident we
will prevail on appeal, Larian said. </p>
<p>The case is Mattel v. MGA, 11-56357, U.S. Appeals Court for
the Ninth Circuit (San Francisco.) </p>
<h2>Martin Marietta''s Nye Says Vulcan Takeover Would Mean Growth </h2>
<p>Martin Marietta Materials Inc. (MLM) Chief Executive Officer Ward
Nye told a judge his planned $4.7 billion hostile takeover of
rival gravel producer Vulcan Materials Co. (VMC) would lead to long-
term growth. </p>
<p>Nye''s testimony came a day after Vulcan CEO Don James told
Delaware Chancery Court trial Judge Leo Strine Jr. that the
companies had been in friendly talks about a merger of
equals just two years ago. Martin Marietta made the
unsolicited offer in December, after negotiations stalled. </p>
<p>I''ve always viewed it as a very attractive and
synergistic combination, Nye told the judge in the second day
of trial in Wilmington. He said the merger, seriously
contemplated in talks in 2010, would produce hundreds of
millions of dollars in savings. The operating efficiencies
would have been huge, based on earlier studies, he said. </p>
<p>Vulcan has rejected the offer as inadequate and claims
Martin Marietta violated a confidentiality agreement not to
reveal the negotiations. Martin Marietta sued contending the
agreement lacked any clause prohibiting takeover solicitations. </p>
<p>The combination of Martin Marietta, based in Raleigh, North
Carolina, and Vulcan, of Birmingham, Alabama, would create the
world''s largest producer of sand, gravel and crushed stone. </p>

<h2>EPA''s Greenhouse Gas Rules Are Illegal, Opponents Tell Court </h2>
<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency''s limits on
industrial emissions of greenhouse gases including carbon
dioxide are illegal and must be thrown out, opponents told
federal judges in Washington. </p>
<p>A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals yesterday
considered challenges to the agency''s rules determining which
polluters are covered and when states and industries must comply
with regulations curtailing the use of greenhouse gases. </p>
<p>The agency crossed the line from statutory interpretation
to statutory revision, Peter Keisler, a lawyer for the
National Association of Manufacturers, told the judges. He said
the EPA violated the law when the agency raised emissions
thresholds far above what Congress called for. </p>
<p>Companies such as Massey Energy Co. (MEE), business groups
including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and states led by Texas
and Virginia are seeking to stop the agency through more than 60
lawsuits. Some argue that the agency relied on biased data from
outside scientists, including some affiliated with the so-called
climategate scandal. </p>
<p>The arguments were split into three parts. The panel heard
arguments Feb. 29 on the agency''s finding that greenhouse gases
are pollutants that endanger human health. They also heard
arguments against a 2010 rule on motor vehicle emissions that
opponents said improperly sets greenhouse-gas standards for
stationary sources, such as steel mills and power plants. </p>
<p>Yesterday, the court considered challenges to the EPA''s
tailoring rule, which limits the businesses covered by
carbon regulation and phases in controls. </p>
<p>The agency aims to phase in industrial polluters covered by
the carbon rules through 2016. The EPA argued in court filings
that the tailoring rule is acceptable under the Clean Air Act
and necessary to avoid states being overrun with permit
requests. </p>

<h2>Apple Says Giving Proview IPad Brand Would Harm Consumers </h2>
<p>Apple Inc. (AAPL), battling for ownership of the iPad trademark
for its tablet computer in China, said allowing Proview
International Holdings Ltd. (334) to make products with that brand
would hurt consumers. </p>
<p>Lawyers for both companies presented arguments for almost
six hours at the Higher People''s Court of Guangdong in southern
China yesterday before being asked by the three judges if they
wished to settle the case. They said they would consult with
their clients and the hearing was adjourned without a new court
date or a time frame for a ruling. </p>
<p>Apple appealed a November ruling by a lower court that the
trademark belongs to the Shenzhen unit of Proview, a failed
display maker, and not the Taiwanese unit that signed a 2009
deal. Losing the appeal would open Apple to lawsuits seeking
damages and enable a nationwide ban on iPad sales in the
company''s biggest market outside the U.S. </p>
<p>Consumers in China have come to associate this trademark
with Apple''s tablet computer, Shi Yusheng, one of the lawyers
representing Apple, said during the hearing. Allowing Proview
to use the brand to make their own products would cause
confusion and harm consumer interests. </p>
<p>The dispute centers on whether Proview''s Taiwan unit, which
Apple paid 35,000 British pounds ($55,000) to use the iPad name
in mainland China, had the right to sell it or whether that
rested with the Shenzhen unit and its creditors, including Bank
of China Ltd. (601988) and China Minsheng Banking Corp. (1988) </p>

<h2>Verdicts/Settlements </h2>
<h2>Cigarette Makers Can''t Be Forced to Use Graphic Warnings </h2>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration was blocked by a
federal judge from requiring tobacco companies to put graphic
health warnings on cigarette packaging. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Richard Leon in Washington said the
government''s rule violates the tobacco companies'' rights to free
speech. </p>
<p>These mandatory graphic images violate the First
Amendment by unconstitutionally compelling speech, Leon wrote
in yesterday''s decision. </p>
<p>Under direction from Congress, which wanted tobacco
companies to use color graphics depicting the negative health
consequences of smoking, the FDA selected nine images, including
ones of a corpse and cancerous lungs. The FDA wanted to require
tobacco companies beginning Sept. 22 to put one of the labels on
each pack of cigarettes, pairing the images with text such as
Smoking can kill you. </p>
<p>The graphics were supposed to cover the top half of the
front and back of cigarette packages and 20 percent of print
advertisements. The FDA estimated the visual warnings would help
lower the smoking rate by about 0.212 percentage points, Leon
wrote in his opinion. </p>
<p>Units of  Lorillard Inc. (LO) and Reynolds American Inc. (RAI), along
with Commonwealth Brands Inc. and Liggett Group LLC, sued the
FDA in August, claiming the mandates for cigarette packages,
cartons and advertising would violate the First Amendment. The
companies said in court papers that it would cost them a
combined total of about $20 million to meet the 2012 deadline. </p>
<p>The opinion is a straightforward and clear affirmation
that compelled speech by the government is not only rarely
constitutional but plainly unconstitutional in this case,
Floyd Abrams, a lawyer for Lorillard, said in a phone interview. </p>
<p>Michelle Bolek, an FDA spokeswoman, said in an e-mail that
the agency doesn''t comment on litigation as a matter of policy. </p>
<p>The case is R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. v. U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, 11-cv-01482, U.S. District Court, District of
Columbia (Washington). </p>
<h2>Cantor Fails to Win Damages From Four Who Joined China Bank </h2>
<p>Cantor Fitzgerald LP failed to win damages from four
managing directors in Hong Kong who left the New York-based
brokerage to join China-backed investment bank Reorient
Financial Markets Ltd. </p>
<p>There is not a shred of evidence suggesting that, whether
individually or collectively, they had any intention to injure
Cantor Hong Kong, High Court Judge A.T. Reyes said in a
judgment handed down yesterday. </p>
<p>Cantor''s Europe and Hong Kong units had sought HK$8.7
million ($1.1 million) in damages from former Hong Kong head
Jason Boyer and three others, accusing them of breaching their
employment contracts and causing a 29 percent drop in its
average monthly revenue in the Chinese city. </p>
<p>Victoria Ho, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for Cantor at
Ogilvy, couldn''t immediately provide a comment from the
brokerage in response to yesterday''s court decision. </p>
<p>Boyer, Bradford Ainslie and Brett McGonegal of Cantor''s
Asian cash equities desk and Uwe Parpart, its former Asia chief
economist and strategist, left for a firm now known as Reorient
Financial on the same day last year. The startup is backed by an
asset manager under China''s State-owned Assets Supervision and
Administration Commission and aims to become a global investment
bank, according to the defendants. </p>
<p>All four told the court in a trial in January that they
left Cantor independently. </p>
<p>He ordered the defendants to pay Cantor at least $1.3
million, mostly representing payments in lieu of notice. Cantor
was ordered to pay most of the defendants legal fees. </p>
<p>The case is Cantor Fitzgerald Europe, Cantor Fitzgerald

Ainslie, Brett McGonegal, Uwe Henke von Parpart, HCA1160/2011 in

<h2>Lehman Client-Money Appeal Is Rejected by U.K. Supreme Court </h2>
<p>The U.K. Supreme Court ruled clients of Lehman Brothers
Holding Inc. (LEHMQ)''s British unit whose money wasn''t properly
separated from the bank''s own funds can access billions of
dollars held in customer accounts. </p>
<p>Courts should interpret future claims in a way which
affords a high degree of protection for all clients, Supreme
Court Judge John Dyson said in yesterday''s decision. All
client money is subject to a trust that arises upon receipt of
the money. </p>
<p>Customers of insolvent firms, including Lehman Brothers and
MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ), without properly separated cash had
faced uncertainty about whether they would be given access to a
protected pool of client money or treated as unsecured creditors
and suffer greater losses on their claims. The ruling is a
victory in a three-year battle for CRC Credit Fund Ltd. and two
Lehman affiliates that were told their claims would be treated
as unsecured. </p>
<p>It''s a boost for investor protection and an important
stepping stone in terms of getting the administrators closer to
being in a position, at long last, to get client money back to
those entitled, Robert Turner, a lawyer for CRC, said in an e-
mailed statement. </p>
<p>The Supreme Court said clients should be able to claim from
the protected pool even if they weren''t given the correct status
before the brokerages failed, and that client money mixed with a
firm''s own funds should be added to the pool. Under U.K. rules,
client funds are pooled together in the event of insolvency
before being distributed. </p>

<h2>Ex-General Re Executives Face Fraud Retrial in January 2013 </h2>
<p>Four former executives at General Reinsurance Corp. and one
at American International Group Inc. (AIG) face a Jan. 22 retrial on
charges of defrauding AIG investors of as much as $597 million. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Vanessa Bryant will preside over the
trial in Hartford, Connecticut, according to an order made
public Feb. 29. On Aug. 1, the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York
ordered a new trial, reversing the executives'' convictions in
2008. </p>
<p>Federal jurors in Hartford convicted former General Re (134618Q)
Chief Executive Officer Ronald Ferguson, ex-Chief Financial
Officer Elizabeth Monrad, ex-Senior Vice President Christopher
Garand and ex-Assistant General Counsel Robert Graham. Former
AIG Vice President Christian Milton also was found guilty. </p>
<p>Prosecutors said the fraud involved a sham transaction in
2000 and 2001 to inflate AIG''s loss reserves by $500 million. It
preceded the financial crisis of New York-based AIG, which got a
bailout of $182.3 billion from U.S. taxpayers. The appeals court
said the trial judge at the time, Christopher Droney,
erroneously let prosecutors show jurors three charts with AIG
stock-price data. Droney has since joined the appeals court. </p>
<p>Droney also erred by improperly instructing the jury on
causation, according to the appeals court opinion. </p>
<p>Bryant''s order set a schedule for prosecutors and defense
lawyers, including a pretrial conference on Dec. 3 and jury
selection on Jan. 3. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Ferguson, 08-6211, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit (New York). </p>

<p>A U.S. trade agency said it will
review a judge''s findings that Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. (MMI)
infringed one Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) patent and not six others. </p>
<p>The U.S. International Trade Commission said today that it
will consider aspects of all seven patents. The agency has the
power to block imports of products that violate U.S. patent
rights. Notice of the decision was posted on the agency''s
website. </p>
<p>Motorola Mobility, being bought by Google Inc. (GOOG), was accused
of infringing seven Microsoft patents. Microsoft said it''s owed
royalties from any company making products running on Google''s
Android operating system, and filed the ITC complaint to stop
imports of Motorola Mobility''s Android-based phones. </p>
<p>The judge found that the six patents weren''t infringed, and
that two were invalid. The case targets Motorola Blur devices,
including the Atrix, Backflip, Bravo, Charm, Cliq, Devour,
Droid, Droid 2, Spice and the Xoom tablet. </p>
<p>The commission said it will consider the judge''s
infringement analyses of the patents, the validity of the patent
that Administrative Law Judge Theodore Essex had found
infringed, and whether Microsoft had met the requirement that it
be using the inventions as well. </p>
<p>We look forward to the ITC''s review of the issues it has
identified, Microsoft Deputy General Counsel David Howard said
in an e-mailed statement. We remain confident that the
Commission will affirm that Motorola has infringed our
intellectual property. </p>
<h2>Broader Effort </h2>
<p>Motorola Mobility said the questions asked by the
commission may help it win the case. </p>
<p>Motorola is pleased with today''s ITC notice identifying
the issues to be reviewed in the ALJ''s initial determination of
December 20, 2011, Christa Smith, a spokeswoman for the
company, said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>The case is part of a broader effort to curtail the growth
of Android, licensed for free by Google to further its mobile-
advertising business. The platform has become the most popular
for smartphones, with 51 percent of the global market in the
fourth quarter, compared with 2 percent for Microsoft, according
to researcher Gartner Inc. </p>
<p>Microsoft, the world''s biggest software maker, has said it
reached licensing agreements with makers of more than 70 percent
of the Android-based smartphones sold in the U.S. </p>
<p>Apple Inc. (AAPL), whose operating system had 24 percent of the
global smartphone market, also is suing makers of Android
devices, seeking to force Android handset and tablet makers into
removing key features that it contends copy the iPhone and iPad.

<p>Restaurant owner Bernardo Van der
Vyver is thrilled by the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona,
Spain''s second-largest city. And he isn''t a techie. </p>
<p>At Ben cafe, which offers a menu of 18 dishes about 200
meters (660 feet) from the Fira conference center, Van der Vyver
said he had to hire extra waiters as sales doubled in the past
four days. He is just one example of those who stand to gain
from the more than 300 million euros ($400 million) in revenue
the city receives from the event, according to its organizer. </p>
<p>This week has been fantastic for my business, said Van
der Vyver, 41, who also serves food inside the Fira. I''ve seen
an increasing number of customers since the Mobile came to
Barcelona six years ago. This has been a good one, and I want
the next one to be even better. </p>
<p>Barcelona, which ranks behind Madrid by population, is the
capital of Catalonia, a region whose budget deficit has reached
4.28 percent of its gross domestic product. That''s the third-
biggest behind Castilla-La Mancha and Murcia. Earlier this week,
its government approved a plan to cut the wages of more than
200,000 workers in the public sector by 3 percent this year to
save 180 million euros, said Marta Vilalta, a spokeswoman. </p>
<h2>Traffic Jam </h2>
<p>Further reductions in education and health care led to
demonstrations during the four-day Mobile World Congress, 
clogging traffic and forcing the organizer to shut down one 
of the main entrances in the evening of Feb. 29. </p>
<p>From restaurants and hotels to taxi service, Barcelona''s
local businesses said the event offered relief in the continuing
debt crisis and high unemployment as more than 67,000 visitors
came to the city for the show, including 3,500 chief executive
officers, according to a statement from GSMA, the industry group
of almost 800 mobile operators including Telefonica SA (TEF), ATT
Inc. (T) and China Mobile Ltd. (941) </p>
<p>David Salazar, a cab driver in Barcelona, said the congress
allowed him to make 50 percent more in sales than a regular day
even as more visitors took public transportation this year
because of the protests. Thousands of youngsters rallied in
Barcelona streets protesting austerity measures. </p>
<p>Thanks to events like this one, we can make up for
declining revenues as people take fewer cab rides, Salazar
said. </p>
<h2>Qualcomm, Gemalto </h2>
<p>The Mobile World Congress provides a stage for technology
companies to show some of the most innovative products, meet
customers and sign business partnerships, said Sy Choudhury,
director of product management at San Diego, California-based
Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM), who attends the trade fair every year. </p>
<p>We showcase all the greatest technologies and it''s also
an easy way for us and partners not only to meet with executives
and key product management folks but also to see the demos,
Choudhury said at Qualcomm''s stand. And of course, we also
want to impress consumers, the press and analysts. </p>
<p>Samir Khlif, vice president of subscriptions management at
smartcard maker Gemalto NV (GTO), said he came to Barcelona along with
other 100 executives and employees of the company from around
the world including Chief Executive Officer Olivier Piou. </p>
<p>This is the event to be if you are in the telecoms
industry because it''s worldwide and you have all technologies,
from NFC to machine-to-machine and cloud computing, in just one
place, Khlif said, referring to the short-range wireless
standard called near field communications. </p>
<h2>Soaring Unemployment </h2>
<p>More than 6,000 temporary jobs were created during the
congress, said Estefania Redondo, a spokeswoman for the city
mayor''s office. Spain has the highest unemployment rate in the
European Union at 23 percent, with almost half of youngsters
without jobs. </p>
<p>Barcelona resident Pol Amat, 19, said he got a contract for
five days, and worked 12 hours a day checking badges at the
site''s entrance. He''s earned 450 euros, he said. </p>
<p>We work hard, but you can''t say no amid the current
crisis, said Amat, who is studying for a degree in tourism.
Besides, I get to meet people from all over the world, which
is very cool. </p>
