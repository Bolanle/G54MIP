&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Vice
Chairman Michael Sherwood was granted a bonus in shares worth
almost $10 million, exceeding the $7 million awarded to Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, the Sunday Times in
London reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bonus for Sherwood, co-chief of the bank in London, was
34 percent down on last year and will be transferred to him over
three years, the Times said. The bonus is in addition to $2.5
million in shares that Sherwood received last week, the
newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noble Group Ltd. named Yusuf Alireza,
formerly co-president of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s Asia-
excluding-Japan unit, as chief executive officer to lead Asia&#8217;s
biggest commodity supplier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alireza will start in the role on April 16, Hong Kong-based
Noble said yesterday in a statement. Alireza replaces Noble
Chairman Richard Elman, who had acted as CEO since Ricardo Leiman resigned in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alireza inherits a company that has grown into Asia&#8217;s
biggest listed commodity trader by sales, overtaking century-old
rivals in Japan including Marubeni Corp. Noble posted its first
quarterly loss in about 14 years in November because of a
downturn in its cotton and carbon-trading businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I do not foresee major changes to the way business is run
given that Richard Elman remains as chairman,&#8221; Lee Wen Ching, a
Singapore-based analyst at CIMB Research Pte., said yesterday by
phone. One of the biggest challenges for Alireza is &#8220;navigating
the environment of more pronounced commodity price volatility.
Noble going forward will have to be more alert in managing such
risks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noble rose 2.4 percent to S$1.475 at 9:43 a.m. in
Singapore. The statement came after the market closed yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These appointments are part of Noble&#8217;s succession
planning, and further strengthen our leadership as I prepare to
reduce my day-to-day involvement,&#8221; Elman said in the statement.
Noble also appointed William Randall as a member of the board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Departing Managers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leiman, who quit as CEO on the same day the company posted
its third-quarter loss, left because of personal reasons and was
at least the fourth senior manager to leave in 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alireza, 41, is leaving Goldman Sachs after 19 years with
the company, according to an internal memo on Nov. 11. Goldman
promoted him in January 2011 to oversee trading operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He joined Goldman&#8217;s fixed-income research group in New York
in 1992 and had held positions in fixed-income sales and hedge
fund sales, rising to become a partner in 2004, according to the
memo. He moved to Hong Kong in 2008 to run the securities
division in the Asia-Pacific region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;During the time I have spent in Asia, I have had the
opportunity to get to know the Noble Group, and have great
respect for the organization and its people,&#8221; Alireza said
yesterday in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elman, who left school at 15 years of age, has transformed
Noble from a commodities trader to one that produces, ships and
sells energy, metals and food materials. Singapore-listed Noble
has $78 billion in trailing 12-month sales, besting rivals
including Japan&#8217;s Mitsubishi Corp., according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Major Review &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third-quarter loss of $17.5 million has thrown the
company into a &#8220;major review&#8221; of its businesses to improve
profitability, the company said last year. The loss was due to a
systematic default by mostly U.S. farmers to deliver cotton,
Noble&#8217;s need to buy the material in the spot market, and a
plunge in the price of carbon credits, the company said Nov. 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We just have to shape up and deal with the situation,&#8221;
Elman, a former scrapyard worker who set up Noble with $100,000
in savings in a small Hong Kong office, said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television on Jan. 16. &#8220;Everybody just has to be a
little more cautious, a little more alert.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noble may have swung to a profit of $106 million in the
final quarter of last year, James Koh, an analyst with Kim Eng
Holdings Ltd., said yesterday in a report. He has a &#8220;buy&#8221;
rating on the stock. Noble is due to report earnings on Feb. 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Randall, who joined Noble in 1997 and is currently the
group&#8217;s head of energy coal and carbon complex, will also be
responsible for hard commodities, Noble said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. and Ranbaxy Laboratories
Ltd. (RBXY) were sued in an antitrust case filed in federal court in
New York alleging the drugmakers engaged in an anti-competitive
scheme to delay a generic version of Lipitor into the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AFL-AGC Building Trades Welfare plan, a health and
welfare benefit plan based in Mobile, Alabama, claims that two
drugmakers engaged in a monopolization scheme after the Pfizer&#8217;s
original patent for the cholesterol-lowering drug expired on
March 24, 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the proposed class-action, or group, lawsuit, the
plaintiffs allege the drug companies agreed to delay the entry
of generic Lipitor for 20 months. As a result of an unlawful
agreement with generic-maker Ranbaxy, Pfizer cost purchasers to
pay more for Lipitor than they would have paid for the generic
version of the drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Defendants&#8217; scheme was successful -- generic Lipitor did
not become available for sale until November 2011,&#8221; the
plaintiffs said. &#8220;As a result of defendants&#8217; illegal acts,
plaintiffs and the indirect purchaser class were forced to pay
billions of dollars more for Lipitor than they would have absent
defendants&#8217; anticompetitive scheme.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both drugmakers were sued in a complaint making similar
allegations filed in federal court in San Francisco by 11
California pharmacies in November. In that case, the plaintiffs
alleged that they held back on a generic version of the
cholesterol-lowering drug in the U.S. and then fixed its price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inflated Costs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipitor sells for more than $4 a day compared with prices
as low as 10 cents day for the generic, the drug stores said in
their complaint. Lipitor&#8217;s purchasers in the U.S. are paying
inflated costs as a result, the pharmacies said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of Lipitor generated $10.7 billion in revenue for New
York-based Pfizer in 2010. A legal settlement with Pfizer gave
New Delhi-based Ranbaxy six months&#8217; exclusivity to market
generic Lipitor, the world&#8217;s best-selling drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit seeks disgorgement of profits from the
allegedly illegal arrangement and triple damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Federal Trade Commission reviewed the terms of the
2008 settlement,&#8221; Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;Pfizer believes the suit has no merit. We
are confident that the Lipitor patent settlement with Ranbaxy is
appropriate,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chuck Caprariello, a spokesman for Ranbaxy, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a voice-mail message left at his office
seeking comment on the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is AFL-AGC Building Trades Welfare Plan, v. Pfizer
Inc. (PFE) 12-CV-931, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama today
nominated a JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) executive to the five-member
board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremiah O. Norton, 34, who is an executive director in the
bank&#8217;s JPMorgan Securities unit, previously served as a policy
adviser in the U.S. Treasury Department during the
administration of President George W. Bush. Before that, he was
an aide to a Republican congressman, Edward Royce of California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norton joins two Democrats and a fellow Republican whose
confirmations to FDIC leadership posts have been delayed by
Senate Republicans who have complained that Obama used a recess
appointment to install Richard Cordray, a former Ohio attorney
general, as director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
without formal Senate approval. Cordray, in his role as consumer
bureau director, also has a seat on the five-member FDIC board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin J. Gruenberg, the White House pick to serve as head
of the FDIC, is working in an acting capacity. Thomas Hoenig,
the FDIC&#8217;s nominee for vice chairman, is waiting for
confirmation. Thomas J. Curry, Obama&#8217;s nominee to lead the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, is serving as a
director of the FDIC while he awaits confirmation to the new
post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three were approved by the Senate Banking Committee
with bipartisan support and have been awaiting final
confirmation by the full chamber. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, reached a preliminary agreement to pay $110
million to settle litigation saying it gouged customers on
overdraft fees for checking accounts, court records show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement would resolve claims by customers including
Andrea Luquetta of Los Angeles, who sued over fees charged to
debit cards attached to her checking account. U.S. District
Judge James Lawrence King in Miami must approve any settlement.
King had earlier rejected arguments by various banks that
customers were legally bound to arbitrate the dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re pleased to have reached an agreement in
principle,&#8221; Patrick Linehan, a JPMorgan spokesman, said in an
e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The litigation before King involves more than 30 banks sued
over their overdraft-fee policies. The customers say the banks
reorder debit-card transactions in their computers to maximize
overdraft fees. Bank of America Corp., the second-biggest U.S.
bank by assets, agreed last year to pay $410 million without
admitting liability to settle an overdraft lawsuit brought by
its customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her lawsuit, filed in 2009, Luquetta claimed JPMorgan
engaged in &#8220;unfair, deceptive and unconscionable&#8221; assessment
and collection of overdraft fees. Her complaint also refers to
the practices of Washington Mutual Inc., which JPMorgan bought
in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Insufficient Funds &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chase didn&#8217;t decline debit transactions when a customer had
insufficient funds and didn&#8217;t warn them an overdraft fee would
be charged, Luquetta alleged. Rather, Chase routinely charged
customers overdraft fees of $25 to $35 for transactions of only
a few dollars, according to the amended complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chase and Washington Mutual &#8220;either refused to allow their
customers to opt out of overdraft protection, or failed to
adequately disclose to their customers that they may do so,&#8221;
according to the complaint, which sought to proceed as a class-
action, or group, lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In many instances, these overdraft fees cost the banks&#8217;
account holders hundreds of dollars in a matter of days, or even
hours, when they may be overdrawn by only a few dollars,&#8221; it
claimed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 2009, Chase announced several changes to its
overdraft fees for debit cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It eliminated overdrafts unless a customer elects the
service, modified the posting order of charges to recognize
debit-card transactions and ATM withdrawals as they occur, ended
fees for accounts overdrawn by $5 or less, and reduced the
maximum number of fees per day to three from six. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Arbitration &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last September, King ruled that customers of SunTrust Banks
Inc., MT Bank Corp., Regions Financial Corp. and Branch Banking
 Trust Co. can use the federal courts rather than arbitration
to pursue overdraft claims. He said a U.S. Supreme Court ruling
last April in ATT Mobility LLC v. Concepcion didn&#8217;t require
arbitration in every case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October, a federal appeals court ruled that King should
consider the JPMorgan case in light of the Concepcion ruling.
The judge, the appeals court ruled, should have limited the
pretrial collection of evidence to &#8220;issues bearing
significantly on the arbitrability of this dispute until the
question of arbitrability has been decided.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bruce Rogow, a lead attorney for the JPMorgan Chase
customers, wouldn&#8217;t comment on the accord. Another lead
attorney, Robert Gilbert, didn&#8217;t return a phone call or e-mail
seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Largest Settlement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America&#8217;s settlement, finalized in November, is the
largest thus far in the litigation. The accord won court
approval despite objections the amount was too little for
customers and lawyers were being paid too much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Union Bank NA agreed to a $35 million settlement with
customers in November; an Associated Banc-Corp. unit,
Associated Bank, agreed in November to pay $13 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Checking Account Overdraft Litigation,
09-md-02036, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida
(Miami). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barnes  Noble Inc. should win a
patent-infringement case brought by Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) that
threatens to halt imports of the bookseller&#8217;s Nook e-reader,
according to staff of the U.S. trade agency hearing the dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff Hsu, a staff attorney at the U.S. International Trade
Commission, said today in an interview he is recommending that
ITC Judge Theodore Essex find there was no violation by Barnes 
Noble of three Microsoft patents. The recommendation came in a
trial beginning today in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essex is scheduled to release his findings April 27, and a
decision in Microsoft&#8217;s favor could lead to a ban on imports of
Nook readers made outside the U.S. The staff acts as a third
party in the case, and there&#8217;s no requirement that the judge
follow the recommendation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is part of a strategy by Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft to push Barnes  Noble into paying patent royalties
for the Nook, which runs on Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Android operating
system. Microsoft claims all Android devices use its technology
and has said it collects fees on 70 percent of Android
smartphones in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker, said the
staff&#8217;s recommendation was made before the presentation of
evidence, and it may change after the trial, according to an e-
mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnes  Noble, based in New York, denies infringing the
patents, and contends they are invalid because they don&#8217;t cover
new inventions. The three patents apply to a way to select text
to make it larger or smaller; a way to put highlights or
footnotes on copyrighted documents; and faster downloading of
text from Web pages that have background images. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Exorbitant&#8217; Fees &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnes  Noble has refused to pay Microsoft and complained
to the government about its adversary&#8217;s tactics. Microsoft
&#8220;uses these patents to demand that every manufacturer of an
Android-based mobile device take a license from Microsoft and
pay exorbitant licensing fees,&#8221; Barnes  Noble said in a trade
commission filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essex has thrown out the patent misuse claim, leaving only
the question of whether the patents are valid and have been
infringed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bookstore chain is banking on the Nook as consumers
turn from traditional publishing. Sales of Nook devices surged
70 percent during the holiday-shopping period, and revenue in
the Nook division may total $1.5 billion in the fiscal year
ending April 30, the company said Jan. 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade agency has the power to block imports of products
that infringe U.S. patents. The Nook is made in Asia, and
Microsoft is counting on the threat of the reader being stopped
at the border to force Barnes  Noble into a licensing deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Amazon.com Agreement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnes  Noble said Microsoft first approached it two years
ago about an agreement, and in meetings and e-mail exchanges
that began in July 2010, Microsoft contended that its patents
had the power to block Android devices. The bookseller said in
an ITC filing that Microsoft was demanding &#8220;shockingly high
licensing fees&#8221; and requirements that would have limited Barnes
 Noble&#8217;s ability to upgrade its Nook devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Android-based Nook devices infringe Microsoft
patents,&#8221; Microsoft said in its statement. &#8220;Barnes  Noble has
refused to license Microsoft&#8217;s intellectual property on
commercially acceptable terms, a decision which has left us with
no choice but to file this action in the ITC.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon.com Inc., whose Kindle reader is the Nook&#8217;s top
competitor, has a license with Microsoft for at least one of the
patents in the case, Microsoft said in its March 2011 complaint.
That filing occurred before Seattle-based Amazon.com introduced
its Kindle Fire, which also runs on a version of Android. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In the Matter of Certain Handheld Electronic
Computing Devices, 337-769, U.S. International Trade Commission
(Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nickel is moving more deeply into
contango as a decline in Russian exports suggests metal has been
retained as inventory, adding to a global glut, said JPMorgan
Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contango describes a market in which later-dated contracts
trade at higher prices than those with nearer dates. Immediate-
delivery nickel today reached a discount of $91 a metric ton to
the three-month contract, heading for the widest closing gap
since December 2009, on the London Metal Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian nickel exports dropped 19 percent to 195,500 tons
last year even after December&#8217;s 91 percent jump, customs figures
showed today. OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel (GMKN), the world&#8217;s biggest
producer of the metal, said Jan. 30 output of nickel at its
Russian units climbed 0.7 percent to 237,200 tons last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The weaker export number reflects a buildup in domestic
inventory of refined metal that will continue to dribble out,&#8221;
Michael J. Jansen, a London-based JPMorgan analyst, said in a
report today. &#8220;There is a lot of nickel in the global economy
which is yet to be priced into flat price and spreads. However,
the market is suspicious of the pending impact, evident in the
steadily widening contango.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nickel for three-month delivery rose 1.4 percent to $21,600
a ton by 5:15 p.m. on the LME. The metal, used mostly to protect
stainless steel from corrosion, is up 15 percent this year after
dropping 24 percent in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nickel market will be in surplus this year by 54,000
tons, JPMorgan forecasts. Inventories monitored by the LME
climbed 9 percent to 94,518 tons since Nov. 1, data from the
exchange show. Norilsk expects total output of the metal to gain
as much as 3.4 percent to 305,000 tons in 2012 after a 0.8
percent drop last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMAG Austria Metall AG (AMAG) rose to the

aluminum producer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares increased 4.5 percent to 18.155 euros at the 5:30

has advanced 15 percent this year, valuing the company at 640
million euros ($840 million). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Equity Partners LLC, JPMorgan&#8217;s buyout arm, is in talks
to sell its 34.5 percent stake in AMAG, Oberoesterreichische
Nachrichten reported on Feb. 4, without saying where it got the
information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Equity is negotiating with several potential buyers
including Raiffeisenlandesbank Oberoesterreich AG, which
acquired an 11.5 percent stake in AMAG&#8217;s initial public offering
last year, and BC Industrieholding GmbH, the Linz, Austria-

according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMAG will report &#8220;very good&#8221; profit that beat

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo 
Co. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. were sued by New York Attorney
General Eric Schneiderman over the use of a mortgage database
that the state said led to improper foreclosures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks&#8217; use of the database, known as MERS, misled
homeowners, undermined foreclosure proceedings and created
uncertainty about ownership interests in properties, the state
said in the complaint filed Feb. 3 in New York state Supreme
Court in Brooklyn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The banks created the MERS system as an end-run around
the property recording system, to facilitate the rapid
securitization and sale of mortgages,&#8221; Schneiderman said in a
statement. &#8220;Once the mortgages went sour, these same banks
brought foreclosure proceedings en masse based on deceptive and
fraudulent court submissions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit comes three days before a Feb. 6 deadline for
states to join a proposed multistate agreement over foreclosure
practices said to be worth as much as $25 billion. Last week, he
was selected by the Obama Administration to help lead a state-
federal group probing misconduct in the packaging and sale of
residential mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MERS tracks servicing rights and ownership interests in
mortgage loans on its electronic registry, allowing banks to buy
and sell loans without recording transfers with individual
counties. The system was created by the mortgage industry to
evade recording fees, avoid the need to publicly record mortgage
transfers and facilitate the packaging of mortgage loans into
securities, Schneiderman claimed in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janis Smith, a spokeswoman for Reston, Virginia-based
Merscorp, which was also named as a defendant in the New York
complaint, said in an e-mailed statement that the company
rejects the attorney general&#8217;s allegations and will fight the
suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rick Simon, a spokesman for Charlotte, North Carolina-based
Bank of America, and Tom Kelly, a spokesman for New York-based
JPMorgan, declined to comment on the suit. Tom Goyda, a
spokesman for San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, said the bank was
reviewing the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Citigroup, Discover Sued Over Student Loan Corp. Losses &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc., Discover Financial Services and Student
Loan Corp. were sued by a union pension fund over claims that
Student Loan Corp. misled investors about increasing losses
beginning in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Oklahoma Firefighters Pension  Retirement System sued
the companies and several Student Loan Corp. (STU) officials in
federal court in Manhattan on Feb. 3, claiming it lost money
when the company&#8217;s stock price dropped after information about
the losses became public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Student Loan Corp., formerly a unit of Citigroup, was sold
to Riverwoods, Illinois-based Discover in September 2010. The
pension fund seeks to represent all Student Loan Corp. investors
from Jan. 15, 2008, to Sept. 23, 2010. The company originated
and held student loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At the same time STU was failing to properly account for
its mounting risks and losses, defendants issued materially
false and misleading statements regarding the company&#8217;s business
and financial results, by telling the investing public that it
was well positioned and performing well despite adverse market
conditions,&#8221; the pension fund said in its complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The suit is baseless and we will seek its prompt
dismissal,&#8221; Shannon Bell, a spokeswoman for New York-based
Citigroup, said in an e-mail. Leslie Sutton, a spokeswoman for
Discover, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Oklahoma Firefighters Pension  Retirement
System v. Student Loan Corp., 12-CV-895, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ex-UBS Trader Adoboli Denied Bail as Trades Prompt Enforcement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kweku Adoboli, a former UBS AG trader, was denied bail at a
London criminal court on the same day U.K. regulators formalized
their enforcement action of the unauthorized trading for which
the bank claims he&#8217;s responsible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bail application Feb. 3 was Adoboli&#8217;s first request to
be released from prison since he was arrested by London police
Sept. 15 for allegedly causing a $2.3 billion loss, the largest
in British history. Adoboli, who holds a Ghanaian passport, was
denied bail in part because of his links to the African country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 31-year-old pleaded not guilty to fraud and false
accounting last week and is being held at Wandsworth prison in
southwest London awaiting a trial in early September. The U.K.
and Swiss finance regulators also said in a statement Feb. 3
that they have begun formal enforcement actions against UBS over
the risk-management processes at its investment bank in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. Financial Services Authority and the Swiss
Financial Market Supervisory Authority, known as Finma, are
investigating the risk controls at UBS&#8217;s investment bank that
didn&#8217;t prevent the unauthorized trades, the agencies said in
statements Feb. 3. The regulators hired the accounting firm KPMG
in September to handle an independent investigation into events
surrounding the losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move to a formal enforcement proceeding typically
indicates the regulators have found sufficient evidence of
financial rule violations. UBS said the regulators told them of
their decision and they are cooperating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Immediately after the unauthorized trading incident, the
Group Executive Board thoroughly investigated the incident and
implemented measures to better protect our firm from
unauthorized activities,&#8221; UBS spokeswoman Jenna Ward said in an
e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adoboli&#8217;s lawyer, Tim Harris of Bark  Co., declined to
comment on the bail refusal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;California&#8217;s Solo Mortgage Probe May Be Hamstrung by 2008 Deal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California Attorney General Kamala Harris objects to giving
banks broad releases of liability for predatory lending. At the
same time, she may be locked into her predecessor&#8217;s 2008
settlement with the largest lender in the state during the
mortgage boom that does exactly that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facing today&#8217;s deadline to join a proposed multistate
agreement over foreclosure practices said to be worth as much as
$25 billion if California joins, Harris has said she won&#8217;t sign
onto a deal blocking her from investigating whether the five
largest U.S. mortgage servicers misled homeowners about the
terms of their loans, among other issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the five lenders involved in the talks, Bank of
America Corp., reached an agreement in 2008 with Harris&#8217;s
predecessor, Jerry Brown, who is now governor, that bars its
Countrywide Financial unit&#8217;s mortgage holders from pursuing
claims of the type that Harris wants to investigate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the &#8220;broad release&#8221; contained in the agreement,
&#8220;it is unclear on what grounds Kamala Harris would pursue
lending violations by Countrywide,&#8221; said Guy Cecala, publisher
of Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry publication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harris, 47, whose state is the most populous and leads the
nation in foreclosure filings for housing units, has described
as &#8220;inadequate&#8221; the proposed settlement state and federal
officials have been negotiating for more than a year with
Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase
 Co., Citigroup Inc., Wells Fargo  Co. and Ally Financial Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foreclosure probe, which had involved attorneys general
from all 50 states, began in October 2010 following disclosures
that banks were using faulty documents to seize homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harris, through spokesman Shum Preston, declined to comment
on the Countrywide settlement or the multistate negotiations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gil Duran, a spokesman for Brown, had no immediate comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another person familiar with negotiations in the multistate
deal said that while the 2008 agreement may present an obstacle
to an investigation of origination claims by Harris, her lawyers
have identified ways in which Countrywide may be violating the
accord. The compliance failures may be grounds to terminate the
settlement, said the person, who didn&#8217;t want to be identified
because the negotiations aren&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America has &#8220;adhered to the letter and spirit of
our agreements with the attorneys general since 2008,&#8221; Richard
Simon, a spokesman for the bank, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more, click here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Foreclosure Accord Said to Ensure Same Terms for All 50 States &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders including Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase
 Co. and state attorneys general agreed to ensure that states
signing a nationwide accord on foreclosures will be entitled to
improved terms won later by states that opt out, two people
familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California Attorney General Kamala Harris is one of the
highest profile attorneys general to publicly balk at the
settlement, saying she won&#8217;t sign a deal that blocks
investigations into mortgage loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who last week
declined to say whether he would sign the deal, on Feb. 3 sued
Bank of America, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, New York-
based JPMorgan and Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) in state court in Brooklyn
over the use of a national mortgage database that the state
claims led to improper foreclosures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement to grant so-called most-favored nation status
comes in the endgame of a probe that began in 2010 following
claims of widespread foreclosure wrongdoing by mortgage
servicers. States have until today to accept the agreement with
the five largest servicers, which also include San Francisco-
based Wells Fargo, New York-based Citigroup Inc. (C) and Detroit-
based Ally Financial Inc. The deal, said to be worth as much as
$25 billion, will settle allegations the banks used faulty or
forged documents to seize homes from borrowers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without California, the value of the deal may sink to $17
billion, said one of the people. Both declined to be identified
because the negotiations aren&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most-favored nation provision would only kick in under
certain thresholds, said a third person familiar with the matter
who also didn&#8217;t want to be named because the talks aren&#8217;t
public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All 50 states announced an investigation into bank
foreclosure practices in October 2010. A group of state
attorneys general and federal officials have since negotiated
terms of the settlement, which would set standards for how banks
conduct foreclosures while providing mortgage relief to
borrowers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Goldman Sachs Suit May Proceed as Class Action, Judge Rules &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A suit against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) may go forward as a
class action on behalf of all investors in a $698 million
mortgage-backed securities offering, a federal judge in
Manhattan ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Harold Baer Jr. granted a request by
the Public Employees&#8217; Retirement System of Mississippi to let it
represent more than 150 investors in the offering, according to
an opinion Baer gave to the parties Feb. 2. The opinion hasn&#8217;t
been released publicly, and a clerk in Baer&#8217;s chambers declined
to provide a copy Feb. 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs say New Century Financial Corp., which
originated the mortgages underlying the securities, failed to
adhere to its underwriting standards and overstated the value of
the collateral backing the loans. They say Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t
conduct proper due diligence when it bought the loans in 2005.
The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Duvally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, didn&#8217;t immediately return a call seeking comment on the
ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Public Employees&#8217; Retirement System of
Mississippi v. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., 09-01110, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;RBS Condoned Libor Conduct, Sought Scapegoats, Fired Trader Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, which accused a fired
Singapore trader of manipulating London interbank offered rates,
had condoned such behavior and sought scapegoats in an internal
probe, the former employee said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBS&#8217;s employees &#8220;were not at any time forbidden from
communicating input or requests&#8221; to have the bank&#8217;s rate
setters set rates at levels to maximize profits, Tan Chi Min,
the former trader, said in court papers filed in Singapore&#8217;s
High Court Feb. 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Such requests and input were regularly made or given in
order to maximize profit,&#8221; Tan said. RBS &#8220;was fully aware of
this, condoned such conduct and waived any right to terminate
employees on the basis of this.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patricia Choo, a Singapore-based RBS spokeswoman, declined
to immediately comment on Tan&#8217;s claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tan, the former head of delta trading for RBS&#8217;s global
banking and markets division in Singapore, sued the bank in
December over his dismissal and is seeking to recoup $1.5
million in bonuses and 3.3 million RBS shares that he claims
he&#8217;s owed. RBS said Tan deserved to be fired because he was
guilty of &#8220;gross misconduct,&#8221; according to its court filing
last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tan in his filing Feb. 2 said RBS, Britain&#8217;s biggest
government-owned lender, started an internal probe after
inquiries by European and U.S. authorities on the conduct of
banks in setting Libor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBS, based in Edinburgh, is cooperating with investigations
by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, U.S.
Department of Justice and European Commission into whether
Libor, which acts as a benchmark for about $360 trillion of
financial instruments worldwide, had been manipulated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Tan Chi Min v The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc
S939/2011 in the Singapore High Court. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Carlyle Drops Class-Action Lawsuit Ban as Opposition Mounts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlyle Group LP abandoned a plan to ban shareholders from
filing class-action lawsuits, a proposal that could have delayed
the private-equity firm&#8217;s long-awaited stock sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Washington-based firm amended the documents for its
initial public offering last month to include a provision that
would have required future stockholders to resolve any claim
against Carlyle through arbitration rather than in court. The
move provoked controversy among lawmakers and shareholder rights
advocates, who urged the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
not to approve the arbitration clause. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;After consultations with the SEC, Carlyle investors and
other interested parties, we have decided to withdraw the
proposed arbitration provision,&#8221; Christopher Ullman, a Carlyle
spokesman, said Feb. 3 in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We first
offered the provision because we believed that arbitrating
claims would be more efficient, cost effective and beneficial to
our unitholders.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlyle is seeking to market its IPO to investors early in
the second quarter through a road show, according to a person
with direct knowledge of the plans, who asked not to be named
because the information isn&#8217;t public. The road show is one of
the final steps before a company goes public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democratic Senators Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Al
Franken of Minnesota and Robert Menendez of New Jersey urged
Feb. 3 SEC Chairman Mary Shapiro not to clear the IPO unless
Carlyle drops the arbitration clause. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Swiss Agree to Transfer Encrypted Documents to U.S. Authorities &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switzerland agreed to transfer about 20,000 encrypted
documents to authorities in the U.S. as the two countries work
toward settling a dispute over tax evasion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switzerland may help decode the names should the two
nations find a comprehensive solution to the dispute, Roland
Meier, a spokesman for the Swiss Finance Ministry, said in an e-
mailed response to questions from Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating 11
financial institutions in Switzerland, including Credit Suisse
Group AG (CSGN), suspected of helping Americans hide money from the
Internal Revenue Service. The U.S. and Switzerland are in talks
to resolve the probe of offshore tax evasion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven financial firms, including Swiss banks and the local
units of foreign companies, handed over data, such as e-mails,
travel plans and details of internal procedures, to the U.S. by
the end of last month, Tages-Anzeiger reported Feb. 3, without
saying where it got the information. Employee and customer names
were blacked out, the Zurich-based newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford Used &#8216;Slush Fund&#8217; at SocGen for Bribes, Davis Testifies &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R. Allen Stanford funneled millions of dollars siphoned
from investor deposits through a &#8220;slush fund&#8221; at Societe
Generale SA in Switzerland to cover bribes, personal expenses
and private investments, his former finance chief told jurors at
the ex-financier&#8217;s criminal fraud trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was a slush fund, just used for whatever the holder
wanted to use it for,&#8221; James M. Davis, Stanford Financial Group
Co.&#8217;s former chief financial officer, testified Feb. 3 about the
SocGen account. &#8220;One purpose was to pull cash out to bribe the
regulator in Antigua, Mr. Leroy King.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors contend Stanford diverted $2 billion from
customer deposits at his Antigua-based Stanford International
Bank to fund his luxurious lifestyle and money-losing ventures
such as Caribbean airlines and real-estate developments. More
than $40 million went to maintain Stanford&#8217;s yachts and as prize
money for a cricket tournament, according to records introduced
in the 10th day of Stanford&#8217;s trial in federal court in Houston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis, 63, told jurors that by the end of 2007, $130
million had been transferred from the Antiguan bank to the
Stanford account at SocGen. &#8220;These funds came from CD
depositors,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Assistant U.S. Attorney William Stellmach asked Davis
how much of this money Stanford ultimately paid back, Davis
replied, &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe he actually repaid any of the
money.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford, 61, denies all wrongdoing in connection with what
the government claims was a $7 billion investment fraud scheme
built on bogus certificates of deposit at his Antiguan bank.
King, former chief executive officer of Antigua and Barbuda&#8217;s
Financial Services Regulatory Commission, is fighting
extradition to the U.S., where he was indicted in 2009 on
charges he accepted bribes from Stanford to mislead U.S.
securities regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Stanford, 4:09-cr-00342, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ex-Credit Bancorp Officials Will Pay $329 Million in SEC Lawsuit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three former Credit Bancorp Ltd. officials convicted of
operating an international Ponzi scheme must pay almost $329
million in a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, a U.S. judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet in New York ordered Feb. 3
the final judgment against Thomas Rittweger, manager of North
American operations for the firm, Douglas Brandon, a Kentucky
lawyer who represented the firm, and Richard Blech, who was
Credit Bancorp&#8217;s chairman and chief executive officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rittweger and Brandon were convicted at trial in 2003 of
defrauding clients, including the chairman of Vintage Petroleum
Inc., of $210 million, prosecutors said. Blech pleaded guilty
before trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unbeknownst to its clients, the firm operated as a Ponzi
scheme, taking cash and other assets from new investors to make
payments to earlier ones, creating the impression of sizable
returns, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his order, Sweet, who was presiding over the SEC suit,
directed that the three were liable for $218 million,
representing profits from the scheme, with additional interest
of $110.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to court and U.S. Bureau of Prison records,
Brandon was sentenced to 97 months in prison, Blech was
sentenced to 72 months in prison and was released in 2007 and
Rittweger was sentenced to serve 135 months in prison and
ordered to pay more than $18 million in restitution. He is
scheduled to be released from prison in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are U.S. v. Blech, 02-CR-122, and SEC v. Credit
Bancorp, 99-cv-11395, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Motorola Solutions Agrees to Pay $200 Million to Settle Suit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Solutions Inc. agreed to pay $200 million to
settle a 2007 investor lawsuit accusing the company of
overstating its sales prospects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement with the company, which was formerly known as
Motorola Inc., must still be approved by U.S. District Judge Amy
St. Eve, who was scheduled to preside over a trial starting
April 9 in Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased to have this behind us,&#8221; Nicholas Sweers,
a spokesman for the Schaumburg, Illinois-based company, said
Feb. 2 in a phone interview. &#8220;It removes the risk and
distractions of this litigation and enables us to continue to
focus on delivering mission-critical communications solutions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stockholder Eric Silverman initially alleged that then-
Motorola Inc. Chief Executive Officer Edward Zander and other
officers had told investors to expect strong sales growth in the
last quarter of 2006. The lead plaintiffs in the case are the
Macomb County Employees&#8217; Retirement System and the St. Clair
Shores Police  Fire Pension System, both of Michigan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the suit was filed in August 2007 amid declining
sales, Motorola had fallen from the world&#8217;s second-biggest
mobile phone maker to third. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The settlement represents an extraordinary recovery for
investors in a case where there was no financial restatement&#8221;
or an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, the plaintiffs&#8217; attorney, Samuel Rudman of San
Diego-based Robbins Geller Rudman  Dowd LLP, said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Silverman v. Motorola, 07-cv-04507, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;U.K. Court Upholds Damages Ruling Against 3M in MRSA Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A U.K. judge upheld a decision that 3M Co., the maker of
Post-It Notes, should pay $1.3 million to investors after it
decided not to market BacLite, a product that detects hospital
super-bug MRSA, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porton Capital Ltd. and Ploughshare Innovations Ltd., a
civilian unit of the U.K. Ministry of Defence, sued 3M over a
2007 deal that depended on sales of the product, claiming about
$40 million in damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a London judge ruled in November 3M had breached its
obligations, he rejected the estimate of damages as optimistic.
The High Court confirmed Feb. 3 that decision, 3M said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The court&#8217;s final order underscores a decisive victory
for our company and the positions it took relative to this
technology,&#8221; said Maureen Harms, 3M&#8217;s assistant general
counsel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the ruling of $1.3 million was less than what 3M
had offered to settle the case, Porton and Ploughshare will have
to pay some of the legal fees from the dispute, 3M said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are delighted that the U.K. High Court judge today
awarded Porton Group a proportion of its costs in respect of its
contractual dispute with 3M,&#8221; Porton Group said in an e-mailed
statement Feb. 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For 3M to suggest they prevailed in this case when they
breached their contract with Porton and Ploughshare, part of the
U.K. MoD, and have to pay damages and costs is delusional in the
extreme,&#8221; Porton Chief Executive Officer Harvey Boulter said in
the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Litigation Departments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.S. Antitrust Enforcers Add Litigators to Bolster Odds at Trial &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. antitrust enforcers are hiring litigators from major
law firms, signaling a growing readiness for court battles to
block mergers they view as anticompetitive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department&#8217;s antitrust division on Jan. 3
brought in Mark Ryan, a partner at Mayer Brown LLP, as director
of litigation, a new position. He&#8217;ll work for Joseph Wayland, a
former Simpson Thacher  Bartlett LLP antitrust litigator who
joined as civil enforcement chief a year ago. The Federal Trade
Commission intends to hire a trial attorney in coming months,
Commissioner Tom Rosch said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If a case is worth bringing, then we should be prepared
to litigate it,&#8221; Rosch said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an improving economy spurred a 24 percent jump in merger
proposals last year from 2010, the Obama administration may be
seeking to respond more forcefully to deals it considers
anticompetitive, said Andrew Gavil, an antitrust professor at
Howard University School of Law in Washington. Being prepared
for trials sets up a credible threat that may also help
regulators win more favorable settlements, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merger filings under antitrust regulations rose to 1,450 in
fiscal 2011 from 1,166 filings the year before, Sharis Pozen,
the acting head of the Justice Department&#8217;s antitrust division,
said in a speech to the American Bar Association in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most of the deals were approved or settled with
conditions, a few faced court challenges, Pozen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have made a concerted effort to increase the
division&#8217;s litigation resources,&#8221; Pozen said. &#8220;Bringing
additional experienced trial attorneys to the antitrust division
is a perfect complement to our team of experienced litigators
and trial attorneys.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Baer, who leads the antitrust team for Arnold 
Porter LLP in Washington, is being vetted by the White House to
become the new antitrust chief when Pozen departs April 30,
according to two people familiar with the process who asked not
to be identified because of its confidential nature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosch, who has more than 40 years of experience as a trial
lawyer for business clients including Chrysler Corp., General
Motors Corp. and Greyhound Lines Inc., said the FTC should bring
more lawsuits to block deals. The agency reports publicly
settling nine challenges to mergers last year while five were
resolved before any action was taken. Three cases went to court. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. reached an
&#8220;agreement in principal&#8221; to settle a class action suit
claiming losses from the bank&#8217;s securities lending program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit was filed by three union pension funds, which
represented a class of all investors in a group of structured
debt securities. The settlement was to be announced on the
plaintiffs&#8217; website, according to a statement provided today by
Stephanie Cirkovich, a spokeswoman for the federal court in
Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The parties are drafting a formal settlement agreement,
to be submitted to the court for approval within approximately
three weeks,&#8221; according to the statement. &#8220;The settlement
terms will remain confidential until the agreement is submitted
to the court.&#160;The settlement is subject to the court&#8217;s approval
and to certain other conditions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funds claim they lost money that New York-based
JPMorgan invested for them in medium-term notes issued by Sigma
Finance Corp., a structured investment vehicle that collapsed in
2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The union pension funds representing the class are the
AFTRA Retirement Fund, the Imperial County Employees&#8217; Retirement
System and the Investment Committee of the Manhattan and Bronx
Surface Transit Operating System. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Johmann, a JPMorgan Chase spokesman, didn&#8217;t return a
message seeking comment on the announced settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Board of Trustees of the AFTRA Retirement Fund
v. JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 09-cv-686, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan
Stanley will rewrite their so-called clawback policies to make
it clear they will reclaim pay from supervisors as well as from
employees who take excessive risk or engage in improper conduct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memos from both firms confirming the planned changes,
responding to a December shareholder request from New York City
pension funds, were posted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission&#8217;s website. The New York-based companies said
regulators are drafting clawback rules, which may satisfy the
city&#8217;s request for disclosure of how much pay the banks take
back. Dow Jones Newswires reported on the changes earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These two firms have set the standard for clawback
policies in the banking industry,&#8221; New York City Comptroller
John C. Liu, who oversaw $113 billion in pension funds as of
Nov. 30, said in a statement today. &#8220;We appreciate the dialogue
we&#8217;ve had on this issue and will continue to call for them to
disclose the amount of clawbacks if forthcoming regulation does
not require it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liu filed shareholder requests with Goldman Sachs, Morgan
Stanley (MS) and New York-based JPMorgan Chase  Co. seeking tougher
clawbacks after each paid more than $100 million over 18 months
to settle charges of improper conduct tied to mortgage-backed
securities. Spokesmen at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the
fifth- and sixth-biggest U.S. banks by assets, declined to
comment. JPMorgan&#8217;s Joe Evangelisti didn&#8217;t immediately respond
to a request for comment. The company is the biggest U.S. bank
by assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Garland, the New York City comptroller&#8217;s executive
director for corporate governance, withdrew the shareholder
proposals made to Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley after they
agreed to change the language in their policies, according to
memos posted on the SEC&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liu hired Garland to the new position in September 2010.
Garland had served as director of value strategies for the CtW
Investment Group, which he co-founded within Change to Win, a
federation of unions that represented 5.5 million U.S. workers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hawker Beechcraft Inc., the jet maker
partly owned by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), named turnaround
specialist Steve Miller as chief executive officer as the
company works to avoid breaching debt covenants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller&#8217;s hiring spurred American International Group Inc. (AIG),
the bailed-out insurer for which he is chairman, to review
succession plans. Miller, 70, was designated in 2010 to serve as
interim CEO at AIG in the event that Robert Benmosche has to
step down while fighting cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new chief takes over immediately at Wichita, Kansas-
based Hawker Beechcraft, which has been close to violating loan
terms as a softer global economy saps business-aircraft demand.
Hawker Beechcraft hired Perella Weinberg Partners LP as a
financial adviser in December, and its bonds have been tumbling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They are working to address their debt situation, so it&#8217;s
not surprising that they would look to bring in outside people
to help,&#8221; Christopher DeNicolo, a Standard  Poor&#8217;s credit
analyst in New York, said in an interview today. &#8220;The market
for small- and mid-sized business jets is still fairly weak.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller succeeds Bill Boisture, who will remain chairman of
subsidiary Hawker Beechcraft Corp. Nicole Alexander, a company
spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t immediately return a phone call or e-mail
seeking comment on whether Miller will lead a restructuring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Revolving Credit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maker of Hawker-brand business jets was in compliance
with debt covenants as of Dec. 12, Alexander said at the time.
She also said then that the company probably would &#8220;need to
address our revolving credit agreement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawker Beechcraft&#8217;s 9.75 percent notes due in April 2017
fell 4 cents to 8 cents on the dollar at 2:02 p.m. in New York,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeNicolo said Hawker Beechcraft may continue to face debt
covenant compliance issues, and a $1.4 billion debt maturation
in March 2014 may increase chances of a distressed debt exchange
or restructuring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawker Beechcraft&#8217;s small- and mid-sized business jets
compete against models from General Dynamics Corp. (GD)&#8217;s Gulfstream
Aerospace, Textron Inc. (TXT)&#8217;s Cessna Aircraft and Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B)&#8217;s
Learjet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is certainly the most crowded part of the business-
jet market,&#8221; DeNicolo said. Hawker Beechcraft also makes
military training and light-attack aircraft and small planes
used for air ambulance and aerial survey needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AIG Chairman &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller remains chairman at New York-based AIG, according to
the insurer, which received a 2008 federal bailout that swelled
to $182.3 billion. He became a director in 2009 before moving up
to chairman the next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The board has an active succession planning process and
will be assessing its plans in light of Mr. Miller&#8217;s
announcement,&#8221; Mark Herr, an AIG spokesman, said in an e-mail
today. Benmosche in December said he would like to remain CEO
past 2012, longer than previously planned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG has sought to assure investors there will be a smooth
CEO transition as the U.S. government winds down its investment.
Peter Hancock, who runs AIG&#8217;s global property-casualty business,
and life-insurance head Jay Wintrob are two internal front-
runners to be the next CEO, former General Counsel Ernest
Patrikis said last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Delphi, Chrysler &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller dubbed himself &#8220;The Turnaround Kid&#8221; after a career
of helping hobbled companies survive. He helped oversee the
bankruptcy of auto-parts suppliers Delphi Corp. (DLPH) and Federal-
Mogul Corp. (FDML) and assisted in Chrysler Corp.&#8217;s return to profits
after taking $1.5 billion in government loans in 1980. Chrysler
repaid that borrowing seven years early. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His 2008 autobiography was called &#8220;The Turnaround Kid:
What I Learned in Rescuing America&#8217;s Most Troubled Companies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That background &#8220;should reassure creditors that he&#8217;s not
new to the game&#8221; in the event that Hawker Beechcraft opts to
file for Chapter 11 protection, said Dan Luria, director of
research for the Michigan Manufacturing Technology Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Miller said he was &#8220;honored&#8221; to join
Hawker Beechcraft to &#8220;help this company navigate through the
challenges of the current general aviation market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, the fifth-biggest U.S.
bank&#8217;s private-equity arm, and Onex Corp. bought Hawker
Beechcraft in 2007 for about $3.3 billion, giving the bank and
Canada&#8217;s largest buyout firm equal stakes of 49 percent each. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following companies had unusual
price changes in Chilean trading. Stock symbols are in

&lt;p&gt;The Ipsa index slid 0.3 percent to 4,362.74. The MSCI Chile
index gained 0.1 percent to 2,553.91. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cap SA (CAP CC) fell 1.4 percent to 21,308 pesos. Chile&#8217;s
largest steel and iron-ore producer retreated from a six-month
high as the price of iron ore for immediate delivery fell for
the first time in more than two weeks, according to a measure
compiled by The Steel Index Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Embonor SA (EMBONOB CC) rose 2.7 percent to a
nine-month high of 959.99 pesos. Chile&#8217;s second-largest Coca-
Cola bottler has climbed 9.1 percent in the three trading days
since larger rival Embotelladora Andina SA announced a plan to
take over Embotelladora Coca-Cola Polar SA at a 44 percent
premium to Polar&#8217;s shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soc. Quimica  Minera de Chile SA (SQM/B CC) fell for a
fourth day, losing 0.7 percent to 28,207 pesos. Chile will call
for bids to develop and operate lithium mines as authorities

Estrategia reported, citing Mining Undersecretary Pablo Wagner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola Co., the world&#8217;s largest
soft-drink maker, reported fourth-quarter profit that topped
analysts&#8217; estimates as teas and juices boosted sales in Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit excluding some items was 79 cents a share, Atlanta-
based Coca-Cola said today in a statement. That exceeded the 77-
cent average of 14 analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Net income in the quarter fell to $1.65 billion, or 72 cents a
share, from $5.77 billion, or $2.46, a year earlier, when the
company posted a gain from an acquisition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent is expanding sales of
beverages in Asia with global marketing campaigns and products
such as its Minute Maid Pulpy juice drink. Fourth-quarter sales
volume climbed 5 percent in Japan and 10 percent in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Coke&#8217;s fourth-quarter results benefited from continued
strength from its international beverage portfolio,&#8221; Ann Gurkin, an analyst for Davenport  Co. in Richmond, Virginia,
said today in a telephone interview. &#8220;We also found the
continued strong performance by the Coca-Cola and Coke Zero
franchises as a standout for the North American segment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola rose 0.8 percent to $68.55 at 4 p.m. in New York.
The shares climbed 6.4 percent last year, while PepsiCo Inc.
gained 1.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also said it plans to reduce costs by $550
million to $650 million by 2015 and use the savings to invest in
its brands and mitigate higher commodities prices. Coca-Cola
said it exceeded the $500 million it sought to cut during the
four years that ended in the last quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Higher Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola, which is facing higher costs for commodities
such as plastic and corn-based sweeteners, raised pricing to
retailers in North America by 1 percent for the year, less than
the 2 percent to 3 percent it forecast in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kent said demand is strong for its flagship Coca-Cola soft
drink, with volume sales gaining 1 percent even as the company
raised retail pricing for carbonated beverages by 4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a testament to the strength of our brands,&#8221; Kent
said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodity costs this year may increase as much as $450
million from 2011, driven by juice ingredients and sweeteners,
Chief Financial Officer Gary Fayard said on a conference call
with analysts. Foreign-currency fluctuations may reduce
operating income in 2012 by a mid-single digit percentage,
Fayard said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have the right strategic plans in place to mitigate
the impacts of these incremental commodity costs and remain
confident in our ability to achieve our long-term growth
targets,&#8221; Fayard said on the call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;North American Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter sales volume in North America gained 1
percent. Volume sales of Coca-Cola&#8217;s flagship soft drink in the
region grew 1 percent in the quarter, while Coke Zero increased
by a high single-digit percentage, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total sales in the quarter rose 5.2 percent to $11 billion,
matching the average estimate of 11 analysts. The Pacific region
unit, which includes China and Japan, boosted sales volume 5
percent. In the company&#8217;s Eurasia and Africa group, volume
climbed 4 percent while operating income jumped 16 percent.
Sales volume in India rose 20 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the year-earlier quarter, Coca-Cola recorded a $5
billion gain for the 33 percent stake in Coca-Cola Enterprises
Inc. it traded in the purchase of the bottler&#8217;s North American
operations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. agreed to
buy Dwight Asset Management, a Vermont-based stable-value money
manager, from Old Mutual Plc (OML) as it expands retirement offerings
for investors. Terms were not disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dwight, which manages and advises about $42 billion in
assets, is scheduled to become part of Goldman Sachs Asset
Management in the second quarter, the New York-based bank said
in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchase &#8220;enables us to deliver more investment
solutions to help defined-contribution plan participants
preserve and grow their hard-earned retirement savings,&#8221; said
Eric S. Lane and Timothy J. O&#8217;Neill, co-heads of Goldman Sachs&#8217;
investment management unit, in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By expanding defined-contribution products, Goldman Sachs&#8217;
investment unit is seeking a bigger share in the U.S. retirement
market, where assets have surged 47 percent to $17 trillion
since 2000, according to data from the Investment Company
Institute in Washington. Employer-based defined-contribution
plans, which allow individuals to invest money toward
retirement, accounted for about $4.3 trillion of the total. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stable value funds seek to preserve capital by investing in
bonds and are offered in about half of all defined-contribution
plans, according to the Stable Value Investment Association.
There are about $540 billion in assets in such funds, according
to the Washington-based organization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale of Dwight will help &#8220;free up capital to redeploy
into our global distribution and asset management franchise,&#8221;
Peter Bain, the chief executive officer of Old Mutual Asset
Management, said in today&#8217;s statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industrias Penoles SAB (PEOLES* MM), Mexico&#8217;s largest

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO MM), the world&#8217;s largest
Spanish-language broadcaster, fell 0.7 percent to 50.49 pesos.

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co., the world&#8217;s largest
soft-drink maker, will see its spending on commodities increase
this year because of higher costs for sweeteners and juices,
Chief Financial Officer Gary Fayard said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costs will increase between $350 million and $450 million,
compared with a rise of $800 million in 2011, when the Atlanta-
based company spent more on sweeteners, juices, metals and
plastics, Fayard said today during an earnings conference call
with analysts and investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola makes Minute Maid and Simply Orange juices.
Before today, orange-juice futures were up 17 percent in the
past year, reaching a record $2.2695 a pound on Jan. 26 on ICE
Futures in New York. While raw-sugar futures are down 25 percent
from a year ago, last year&#8217;s average of 26.73 cents a pound was
the highest since  1980 and more than double the average of
2008. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dongyan Wang, an executive at data-
storage provider NetApp Inc. (NTAP), did what peers at some other
businesses deem unthinkable: He let the company&#8217;s 10,000
employees start making their own mobile applications for work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do-it-yourself mobile software can be unreliable or leave a
company vulnerable to malware. Wang bet that employee-generated
applications would result in a productivity boost and cost
reduction that outweighed those risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One year later, the effort has resulted in 20 apps,
including an employee directory and another that helps provide
customer service, Bloomberg Businessweek.com reported today. The
apps cost an average of $35,000 to $50,000 to build, compared
with hundreds of thousands of dollars or more for programs made
with help from conventional business-software makers such as SAP
AG and Oracle Corp., Wang said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We call it, &#8216;You cook and we host for you,&#8217;&#8221; said Wang,
senior director of enterprise solutions and the person
responsible for mobile apps at Sunnyvale, California-based
NetApp. &#8220;Both our own team and our users are amazed at how we
can get value so quickly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A growing number of workers, even those without technical
expertise, are building mobile apps for use on the job, a
democratization of technology creation spurred by the boom in
portable devices, such as Apple Inc. iPads and the smartphones
featuring Google Inc.&#8217;s Android. That can create tension with
information technology managers concerned about network
security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Not the Boss of Me&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, rank-and-file employees will build at least a
quarter of new business applications by 2014, up from less than
5 percent in 2007, Stamford, Connecticut-based Gartner Inc.
predicts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The business units are telling IT, &#8216;You&#8217;re not the boss
of me anymore,&#8217;&#8221; said Jeffrey Hammond, principal analyst at
Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Forrester Research Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DIY app trend is fueling demand for services provided
by such companies as Taptera, Mobile Roadie and Socialize Inc.&#8217;s
AppMakr, which can make it easier and cheaper to build mobile
apps. They&#8217;re part of a market for mobile-application
development that generated $20.5 billion in revenue in 2011, and
the figure may rise to $100 billion in 2015, according to a
report from research firm Research2guidance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Avoiding IT Department &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Within a large organization, it&#8217;s typically a small
department that wants an app but doesn&#8217;t want to go to IT,&#8221;
said Raju Vegesna, whose title is evangelist at software maker
Zoho Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#8217;s a reason IT departments are reluctant to cede
control of app creation. Employees who build their own apps
might create bugs or security holes in a corporate network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s why NetApp insists on vetting each app much like
Apple reviews each program made available on its App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We can&#8217;t allow everyone to publish their own app and put
it into the app store,&#8221; Wang said. About 90 percent of the apps
that have been built by employees require some revision, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the app review process at NetApp is fairly nimble
and a way for the company to get new software into circulation
relatively quickly and cheaply when compared to the old way of
creating enterprise software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re almost the other extreme of traditional IT where
you had to go through a steering committee,&#8221; Wang said. &#8220;If
the business groups say we have money and this idea, we can
build it within six to eight weeks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Open to Customers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s employees make apps for internal use, as well
as use by clients, including one for customer support and
another that compares NetApp products with a competitor&#8217;s.
There&#8217;s also a business-intelligence app that helps executives
analyze corporate data and make decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees at Accenture Plc, the world&#8217;s second-largest
technology-consulting company, used AppMakr to build an app to
communicate with clients in its consumer goods and services
division. The app also gives customers access to case studies,
podcasts and news, and it&#8217;s available free to other businesses
through Apple&#8217;s App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other app-building services such as Zoho Creator and Intuit
Inc.&#8217;s QuickBase can help employees create their own Web apps --
applications that are accessed through a mobile Web browser.
Hiring a Web developer to make a custom mobile app can easily
run $50,000 to $75,000. In contrast, some of these services are
free or can cost less than $10,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Honeywell, Ikea &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoho&#8217;s Web app building service has been used by employees
at Honeywell International Inc., Ikea AB, Hewlett-Packard Co.,
Sony Corp. and Walt Disney Co.&#8217;s Pixar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even traditional software makers including SAP see mobile-
app development as a less expensive way to connect customers
with their larger-scale software systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris O&#8217;Connor and Dan McCall realized how expensive and
time-consuming it was to develop mobile apps when they were
working at Genentech Inc., the cancer-drug maker acquired in
2009 by Roche Holding AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Connor and McCall built about 60 custom apps to do things
like create a company directory or to reserve conference rooms
for employees. The pair co-founded startup Taptera because they
realized that other companies would also want to buy these types
of apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intuit has given its own employees permission to create
QuickBase apps, which are online database apps designed to
collect and distribute information. So far, 3,500 of the
company&#8217;s 8,000 employees have built their own QuickBase apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We still see business teams at the workgroup or division
level having some need that isn&#8217;t getting served and choosing to
self-solve,&#8221; said Allison Mnookin, vice president and general
manager at Intuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Intuit lawyer built a Web app to manage the process for
submitting patents. The app made it easier for employees to
submit ideas, distribute them internally for review and get
alerts about a reward for those whose ideas get patented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He did all of that without needing to know a line of
code,&#8221; said Mnookin. &#8220;The pace of business is moving faster,
and folks are looking for a way to solve their problems.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, is seeking outside investors for
its REDI Technologies trading-software business, according to
two people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit, which develops and manages software that allows
Goldman Sachs clients to trade financial products
electronically, could reach agreement with new investors within
a month, said one of the people, who declined to be identified
because the talks are private. Dow Jones Newswires reported on
the unit&#8217;s planned spin-out earlier yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs intends to maintain a significant investment
in the business, which relocated to the bank&#8217;s New Jersey
building from its Manhattan headquarters in the past few months,
according to one of the people. Investors are likely to include
other brokers with global businesses across asset classes, the
other person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Commissions are currency on the Street these days,&#8221;
Scott Harrison, global head of product at Liquidnet Holdings
Inc. in New York, said in a phone interview. He is a former
chief executive officer of Burbank, California-based UNX LLC, a
technology company that has an execution-management system.
&#8220;You have to pay commissions to multiple brokers to get
services,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Clients need access to many brokers on
one system.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Currencies, Rates &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs acquired the software that formed the basis
for REDI Technologies when it purchased New York Stock Exchange
specialist Spear, Leeds  Kellogg LP in 2000 and has expanded it
to handle trades in asset classes such as currencies and
interest rates. Goldman Sachs expects the independent business
to meet client demand for execution management systems that give
them easier access to multiple brokers and aren&#8217;t seen as
single-dealer platforms, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tabb Group LLC, a New York-based research firm, said in a
June report that single-dealer execution-management systems,
which once functioned for clients as a &#8220;direct highway of order
flow and a portal to services,&#8221; have become less relevant to
the brokers that sponsored them. Their return on investment is
&#8220;questionable,&#8221; the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The REDI platform is used by Goldman Sachs&#8217;s hedge fund
clients, asset managers and brokers that employ the firm&#8217;s
electronic-trading services. While orders can be sent to some
brokers through the REDI system, it&#8217;s used primarily to ship
orders to Goldman Sachs, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rishi Nangalia, an executive in the Goldman Sachs
Electronic Trading unit, will have a senior role in the
business, according to one of the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Barclays, ConvergEx &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s plans come about a year after London-based
Barclays Plc sold the RealTick trading platform, which lets
customers access services from multiple brokers, to New York-
based ConvergEx Inc. Barclays said in December 2010 that it
planned to use the system within its investment banking unit and
offer the platform to customers. The bank got RealTick when it
acquired part of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase  Co., Knight Capital Group
Inc. and other securities firms bought execution-management
systems starting in the mid-2000s to give mutual funds and other
clients access to exchanges and algorithms, or trading
strategies that allow them to process larger orders in small
pieces over a preset period, along with other transaction
services. Some platforms were open to the algorithms of multiple
brokers or technology providers while others focused on those
from a single firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ITG, Instinet &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Single-broker EMSs offer branding, constant presence and
a single portal to services,&#8221; Tabb&#8217;s report said. &#8220;Routing to
other brokers may also be an option, but as a reluctant service
rather than an advertised benefit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment Technology Group Inc. and Instinet Inc., a
subsidiary of Tokyo-based Nomura Holdings Inc., offer execution
platforms to customers. Both firms are execution-only brokers
that don&#8217;t trade with their own money. Bloomberg LP, the parent
of Bloomberg News, offers similar systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and brokers providing mainly execution
services had the most success in finding users among asset
managers that considered them one of their top five brokers, the
Tabb report said. Trading platforms from Morgan Stanley,
JPMorgan and Bank of America Corp. are less utilized, Tabb said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our hope is to deliver a product to our clients that&#8217;s
open, that delivers them products and services from multiple
brokers, assets and markets across the globe,&#8221; Nangalia, who
runs REDI Technologies, said in an undated online video about
the business. &#8220;We are not limited to the services that are
offered by one firm nor by the size of a small technology
vendor.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co., owner of the ABC
broadcast network, is in talks with Univision Communications
Inc. to create an English-language 24-hour cable-news channel,
according to two people with knowledge of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, would oversee
advertising sales and distribution for the venture, said the
people, who sought anonymity because an agreement hasn&#8217;t been
reached. The channel would draw newsgathering resources from ABC
News and Univision, the largest U.S. Spanish-language
broadcaster, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussions have been under way for at least six months
and are ongoing, said the people. The channel would be based in
Miami and start service before the November presidential
election, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A venture would provide Disney, which reports first-quarter
results today after markets close, with a cable-news presence,
and advance Univision Chief Executive Officer Randy Falco&#8217;s goal
of building new channels. Falco is interested in starting
English-language service in sports and news, he told the Wall
Street Journal in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closely held Univision, based in New York, is starting a
Spanish-language telenovela network this month on Dish Network
Corp.&#8217;s satellite-TV system. Spanish-language sports and news
channels will follow by midyear, according to Monica Talan, a
spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney added 1.2 percent to $40.46 yesterday in New York
and has gained 7.9 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Journal reported Univision&#8217;s discussions with Disney
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s Pangang Group Co. (PISZ), California
businessman Walter Liew and two former DuPont Co. (DD) employees face
charges they conspired to steal trade secrets about titanium
dioxide technology from DuPont, according to the U.S. Justice
Department and a revised indictment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defendants made a &#8220;long-running effort&#8221; to obtain
U.S. trade secrets for Chinese companies, U.S. Attorney Melinda Haag in San Francisco said yesterday in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China sought to develop a manufacturing process for
developing chloride-route titanium oxide, a white pigment used
in paint, plastics and paper, and state-owned Pangang conspired
to steal the technology developed by DuPont, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The theft of America&#8217;s trade secrets for the benefit of
China and other nations poses a substantial and continuing
threat to our economic and national security,&#8221; Lisa Monaco,
assistant attorney general for national security, said in an e-
mailed statement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pangang runs the largest titanium complex in China and is
one of the country&#8217;s largest titanium pigment producers,
according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liew, of Orinda, California, and the other defendants sold
information on DuPont&#8217;s trade secrets to Pangang so it could
develop a large-scale titanium-oxide factory in Chongqing,
China, Haag said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company began building the plant in 2010, with the
first phase scheduled to be commissioned at the end of this
year, according to Pangang&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conspiracy Charges &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pangang was charged in an indictment with conspiracy to
commit economic espionage, attempted economic espionage and
conspiracy to commit trade-secrets theft. A former vice director
of Pangang&#8217;s chloride process titanium oxide project department
who is a Chinese citizen was also charged and a warrant issued
for his arrest, the Justice Department said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former DuPont employee who had access to information
about a company titanium oxide plant in Taiwan was arrested
today in Harbeson, Delaware, and charged. A second ex-DuPont
employee who lives in Newark, Delaware, was also charged, the
agency said. Arraignment is scheduled for March 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liew was charged with attempted economic espionage,
according to a superseding indictment filed yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was previously charged with witness tampering and
threatening a former employee to prevent the disclosure that he
had hired two former DuPont workers to help design manufacturing
facilities for customers in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dupont Civil Suit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The threat allegedly came just days after Liew and the
employee were sued in a civil case by DuPont and accused of
giving confidential information about the manufacturing process
to competitors in China, according to a 2011 indictment. DuPont,
based in Wilmington, Delaware, the world&#8217;s largest manufacturer
of titanium dioxide, reported the technology theft to the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, leading to a federal
investigation starting last March, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, the government has obtained documents that it
alleges show that Liew was directed by a Chinese government
official to obtain technology needed to build the pigment
manufacturing factories, according to a Jan. 31 court document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A magistrate judge in San Francisco on Feb. 1 ordered that
Liew remain in custody after his lawyers sought his release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liew&#8217;s lawyer, Thomas Nolan, declined to comment yesterday
on the revised indictment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liew owned Oakland-based USA Performance Technology Inc.,
according to the first indictment, filed in August. DuPont sued
the company in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Company General Counsel &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are disappointed that former DuPont employees working
together with certain companies allegedly stole our proprietary
technology,&#8221; Thomas Sager, DuPont general counsel, said in an
e-mail. &#8220;Upon learning of the apparent breach, we took prompt
action and filed a civil suit. We also referred the theft of our
technology to law enforcement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s Anshan Iron  Steel Group won government approval
in May 2010 to merge with rival Pangang Group. Calls to Pangang
spokesman Zhou Jun seeking comment about the charges weren&#8217;t
answered. An Anshan spokeswoman, who declined to be identified
due to a company policy, declined to comment about the case. The
Chinese consulate in San Francisco couldn&#8217;t be reached
immediately for comment on the charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. Liew, 3:11-cr-00573, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V), the world&#8217;s biggest
payments network, said fiscal first-quarter profit climbed 16
percent as consumers increased use of credit and debit cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income for the three months ended Dec. 31 rose to $1.03
billion, or $1.49 a share, from $884 million, or $1.23, a year
earlier, the San Francisco-based company said today in a
statement. The average estimate of 26 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for earnings per share of $1.45. Visa authorized a
new $500 million share repurchase program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Joseph W. Saunders,
66, is positioning Visa for its next phase of growth after U.S.
regulators capped so-called swipe fees, or interchange, that the
company charges merchants for debit-card purchases. Visa, which
derived about 56 percent of revenue from the U.S. in fiscal
2011, has said it intends to generate more than half from
markets abroad by 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We remain intensely focused on further growing our
international business,&#8221; Saunders said in the statement. &#8220;At
the same time, we are moving forward on our innovation
strategy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa advanced 3.2 percent to $111.78 at 6:36 p.m. in
extended trading in New York after gaining 45 percent in the
past year, the second-best performance in the 71-company
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Information Technology Index (S5INFT) after
Purchase, New York-based MasterCard Inc. (MA), the No. 2 network,
which climbed 58 percent. Shares of both companies closed at
all-time highs today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Worldwide Spending &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating revenue was $2.55 billion, beating the average
estimate of $2.47 billion by analysts in the Bloomberg survey.
Worldwide spending on Visa credit and debit cards, adjusted for
currency fluctuations, climbed 11 percent to $994 billion in the
first quarter from a year earlier, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross-border volume, a measure of spending by consumers
outside their home countries, surged 13 percent. Processed
transactions worldwide rose 8 percent to 13.6 billion as
consumers continued to shift from cash and checks to electronic
payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are signs of &#8220;modest&#8221; expansion of worldwide gross
domestic product for the rest of the fiscal year, &#8220;with
emerging markets continuing to grow at rates faster than the
global average,&#8221; Saunders said in a conference call with
analysts after results were announced. &#8220;That being said, we are
closely watching economic conditions that could impact our
business, including continued volatility in Europe.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2012 Outlook &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa updated its 2012 outlook, forecasting net revenue
growth in the &#8220;low teens&#8221; and earnings-per-share growth in the
&#8220;high teens.&#8221; The company previously expected &#8220;high single to
low double-digit&#8221; revenue growth and EPS growth in the &#8220;mid to
high teens,&#8221; according to its fourth-quarter statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, Visa announced a plan to help develop Rwanda&#8217;s
payments system and connect the African nation&#8217;s 11 million
citizens to the global economy. The company also has rolled out
prepaid accounts linked to mobile phones across Africa and the
Middle East. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MasterCard said Feb. 2 that fourth-quarter profit climbed
24 percent to $514 million. The company reported 2011 profit of
$1.91 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MasterCard took a $495 million charge representing its
portion of a potential settlement to price-fixing litigation
that challenges credit-card interchange fees, which generate
about $40 billion a year for U.S. banks. Merchants sued Visa,
MasterCard and banks including JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) in 2005,
claiming that the companies stifled competition by banning
merchants from steering customers to cheaper forms of payment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interchange Litigation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An accord may cost $4 billion, and last February, the
defendants agreed that Visa would be responsible for two-thirds
of any settlement and MasterCard would pay about one-eighth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, Visa said it would deposit $1.57 billion into
its litigation escrow account to prepare for any settlement. It
now has $4.3 billion in the account, Saunders said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Visa is unwilling to agree to any significant or long-
term credit interchange rate reductions or any settlement
agreement that doesn&#8217;t provide a full resolution to that and
other key issues,&#8221; Saunders said during the conference call. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, will unveil the first broadly available test
version of the Windows 8 operating system on Feb. 29 in
Barcelona, Spain, at a mobile industry show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based company sent invitations via
e-mail for an event to show the test product, called the Windows
8 Consumer Preview. Microsoft is relying on the newest version
of Windows to make headway in the tablet-computer market. The
two-hour session is scheduled to take place during the Mobile
World Congress trade show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from Windows software, which runs most of the
world&#8217;s personal computers, has missed analysts&#8217; estimates in
four of the past five quarters, in part because some consumers
are defecting from laptops with Windows to tablets like Apple
Inc.&#8217;s iPad. Microsoft probably won&#8217;t be able to significantly
change that trend until Windows 8 goes on sale, Chief Financial
Officer Peter Klein said in an interview last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has declined to say when Windows 8 will be
officially released. Microsoft shares rose 1 percent to $30.66
at the close in New York. The stock has increased 18 percent
this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following companies had unusual
price changes in Mexico trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close of trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IPC index rose 0.2 percent to 38,140.55. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alfa SAB (ALFAA) , the world&#8217;s largest producer of
aluminum engine heads, rose 2 percent to 174.57 pesos. The
possible initial public offering of the company&#8217;s Alpek
petrochemicals unit may &#8220;liberate value,&#8221; making Alfa stock
attractive at its current price, Monex Casa de Bolsa said today
in an e-mailed research note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, the company said today that fourth-quarter
profit declined 51 percent to 1.1 billion pesos ($86.5 million),
while sales rose 33 percent to 48.3 billion pesos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO) , the world&#8217;s largest
Spanish-language broadcaster, rose 1.4 percent to 51.29 pesos.
The company was upgraded to &#8220;buy&#8221; from &#8220;hold&#8221; at Corp.
Actinver SAB by analyst Martin Lara, who said the stock&#8217;s recent
slump created an &#8220;attractive entry point for long-term
investors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste SAB (ASURB MM), the
operator of airports in southern Mexico, rose 0.8 percent to
86.35 pesos. Passenger traffic climbed 10 percent in January
from a year earlier, the company said in a statement to the
Mexican stock exchange today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitro SAB (VITROA) , the Mexican glassmaker that
defaulted on $1.5 billion of bonds in 2009, jumped 4.9 percent
to 14.96 pesos. The company said yesterday that a judge in
Monterrey gave final approval to restructure its debt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve Bank of New York
sold $6.2 billion in face value of mortgage bonds it assumed in
the rescue of American International Group Inc. (AIG) to Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS), allowing one of its bailout loans to be repaid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Fed said it sold the bonds through a
&#8220;competitive process&#8221; after Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) made an
unsolicited offer to buy assets held by a vehicle called Maiden
Lane II LLC (FARBML2). The sale will allow the repayment of the central
bank&#8217;s loan to Maiden Lane II, which was originally $19.5
billion, according to a statement posted on the New York Fed&#8217;s
website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s sale was the second such this year, following a Jan.
19 disposition of about $7 billion of mortgage bonds to Credit
Suisse. The New York Fed&#8217;s sales were in response to unsolicited
bids, after a series of auctions last year were blamed for
damaging prices. So far, the latest sales haven&#8217;t curbed a rally
in home-loan bonds, with analysts at Morgan Stanley and Bank of
America Corp. saying they are contributing to the gains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When the market saw there was a deep bid for this paper,
the momentum picked up,&#8221; said Bryan Whalen, co-head of mortgage
bonds at Los Angeles-based TCW Group Inc. which oversees $118
billion. &#8220;Both the end buyers as well as the Street are willing
to put money to work. It doesn&#8217;t seem like the momentum is
slowing, if anything, it looks like it&#8217;s picking up.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Fed in June ended its earlier plan to sell
Maiden Lane II assets through regular auctions, following sales
of about $10 billion. The face value of the assets had dwindled
to about $21 billion when the auctions were halted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Selling Piecemeal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Fed began selling the bonds piecemeal after
rejecting a $15.7 billion bid from New York-based insurer AIG
for the entire pool in March. The portfolio includes securities
backed by the types of home loans with some of the highest
default rates, such as so-called subprime, Alt-A (BBMDA60P) and option
adjustable-rate mortgage debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typical prices for the most-senior bonds tied to option
ARMs climbed to 55 cents on the dollar last week from 49 cents
in October and November, according to Barclays Capital data.
That&#8217;s down from last year&#8217;s high of 65 cents in February.
Option ARMs allow borrowers to pay less than the interest they
owe by increasing their balances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed was owed about $6.7 billion on the loan to Maiden
Lane II as of Feb. 1, not taking into account proceeds from last
month&#8217;s transaction. About $6 billion in bonds remain in the
Maiden Lane II portfolio, based on disclosures from the Fed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Continued Interest&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I am pleased with the continued interest in these assets
and am especially gratified that the New York Fed&#8217;s loan to ML
II will be repaid as a result of the sale announced today,&#8221; New
York Fed President William C. Dudley said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed made another loan to help bail out AIG to a vehicle
called Maiden Lane III LLC, and was owed about $9.6 billion
under that facility as of Feb. 1, according to the New York
Fed&#8217;s website. The central bank is also owed about $4.6 billion
from its rescue of Bear Stearns Cos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Fed &#8220;will dispose of the remaining securities
in the ML II portfolio individually and in segments over time as
market conditions warrant through a competitive sales process,
while taking appropriate care to avoid market disruption,&#8221; the
regional bank said. &#8220;There will be no fixed timeframe for the
sales; at each stage, the Federal Reserve will only transact if
the best available bid represents good value for the public.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, and Steven Vames, a spokesman for Credit Suisse, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lucas van Praag, who became one of
the public faces of the U.S. financial industry as Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s global head of corporate communications, is leaving
the firm after 12 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van Praag, a 62-year-old British citizen, will retire at
the end of March and continue to provide strategic advice as a
consultant to the company, according to an internal memo signed
by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and President Gary D. Cohn. The memo&#8217;s contents were confirmed by Michael DuVally,
a spokesman. Van Praag was promoted to partner, the highest rank
in the New York-based company, in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Lucas has played a critical role in helping the firm
navigate through one of the most difficult and testing
environments the firm has faced, particularly during the
financial crisis and its aftermath,&#8221; Blankfein and Cohn said in
the memo. &#8220;His strategic counsel and deep understanding of
complex issues defined his career at the firm as did his warmth,
natural inclusiveness and determination in the face of
relentless demands.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, has
been in talks with Richard &#8220;Jake&#8221; Siewert Jr., 48, a former
counselor to U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, to
manage the bank&#8217;s communications department, three people
familiar with the situation said last week. Siewert worked as a
press secretary for President Bill Clinton and managed corporate
development and public strategy at Alcoa Inc. (AA) before joining
Treasury in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Partners Leave &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van Praag follows about 50 partners who left Goldman Sachs
in the last year amid sagging profits and pay. Six members of
the firm&#8217;s management committee, including trading co-heads
David B. Heller and Edward K. Eisler, also left in the last 12
months. The company eliminated 2,400 jobs last year as it
reduced compensation 21 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the most profitable securities firm in Wall
Street history before converting to a bank in 2008, has been
criticized by regulators and politicians for activities leading
to 2008&#8217;s financial crisis. Blankfein, 57, settled a Securities
and Exchange Commission lawsuit against the firm in 2010,
reviewed the company&#8217;s business standards and rolled out an
advertising campaign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van Praag became known for his disparaging rebuttals to
negative stories, favoring phrases like &#8220;nonsense&#8221; and
&#8220;extraordinarily ill-informed.&#8221; Goldman Sachs partners are
typically the firm&#8217;s highest compensated employees. Van Praag
paid $7.85 million in August 2008 for a townhouse on New York&#8217;s
Upper West Side, the Real Deal reported at the time, citing
public records. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UniCredit SpA&#8217;s Ukrainian unit signed
a $200 million agreement with International Business Machines
Corp. to outsource information technology systems as the bank
seeks to cut costs and improve customer service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is the first instance of full outsourcing in the
region and marks a new era&#8221; &#8220;in the development of Ukraine&#8217;s
financial service sector,&#8221; Joseph Benaroya, vice president of
IBM Global Technology Services, said of the 10-year agreement in
a statement. &#8220;Banks across growth markets are currently under
enormous pressure to reduce costs and operational complexities
while at the same time improve the customer experience.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armok, New York-based IBM wants to expand in the former
Soviet republic. UniCredit&#8217;s unit is the country&#8217;s fifth-largest
lender by assets as of Jan. 1, according to central bank data.
It has a network of nearly 400 branches and provides services to
over 2 million customers across Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;By outsourcing our informational technology activities to
IBM we are able to focus on our core business priorities,&#8221;
Francesco Pusateri, head of UniCredit&#8217;s Global Banking Services
Division, said in the same statement. It &#8220;will help us to
strengthen our leadership in the Ukrainian banking sector.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cooperation with UniCredit&#8217;s Ukrainian unit will result
also &#8220;in growing interest in the region in the same type of&#8221;
services, said Alexander Bloch, the IBM&#8217;s head of financial
services in Russia and CIS, by phone from Kiev. It may bring
other deals for IBM as &#8220;competitors don&#8217;t want to be left
behind and they will have to look for potential outsourcing of
their own IT.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rajat Gupta, the ex-Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) director accused of giving inside information to fund
manager Raj Rajaratnam about that company and Procter  Gamble
Co., may face additional allegations he passed tips, prosecutors
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors, at Gupta&#8217;s arraignment on revised
charges yesterday, also told U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff of a
second &#8220;insider at Goldman Sachs&#8221; who provided Rajaratnam with
information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors disclosed in a Feb. 3 letter &#8220;certain witness
statements related to an insider at Goldman Sachs, a company
that provided information to Mr. Rajaratnam, that did not relate
to Goldman and or Procter  Gamble,&#8221; Rakoff said during the
hearing as he read the Feb. 3 letter aloud. Gupta was a director
at Procter  Gamble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta&#8217;s lawyer, Gary Naftalis, had previously asked the
government to share any evidence that Rajaratnam had an inside
source at Goldman Sachs other than his client. The defense
lawyer has said the evidence may be used to show that the other
source is the culprit, not Gupta. Rakoff has also pressed
prosecutors to identify the purported source, whom he called
&#8220;Mr. X.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta, 63, pleaded not guilty yesterday to a revised
indictment filed last week. The latest charges broaden the
prosecutors&#8217; description of the insider-trading scheme, saying
it began in March 2007, not in 2008, as the U.S. alleged when
Gupta was first charged in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naftalis said that with the new allegations, they need more
time to prepare for trial. Rakoff agreed to postpone until May
21 from its scheduled start date of April 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What the government is doing here now is wildly expanding
what everybody in the world believed the case to be about,&#8221;
Naftalis said, adding later, &#8220;I really think it&#8217;s quite unfair.
They can investigate my client &#8216;til the cows come home.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant U.S. Attorney Reed Brodsky told the judge the
government may file yet another superseding indictment adding
new allegations that Gupta passed tips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge told lawyers that with six additional weeks to
get ready for trial, no further delays will be allowed,
&#8220;barring an act of God.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My goal is to get this show on the road in a way that&#8217;s
fair to all concerned,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said that even if the judge doesn&#8217;t allow them
to further revise the indictment, they may still seek to
introduce evidence at Gupta&#8217;s trial of other acts of alleged
wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naftalis declined to comment on yesterday&#8217;s hearing after
court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta, who denies wrongdoing, faces as long as 20 years in
prison if convicted of any of the securities fraud charges and
as long as five years if convicted of conspiracy, U.S. Attorney
Preet Bharara in Manhattan said. He also faces a fine of as much
as $5 million, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, who was convicted by a jury last year of
insider-trading charges, is serving an 11-year prison term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Gupta, 11-cr-00907, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Four Accused of Running Insiders&#8217; &#8216;Criminal Club&#8217; Indicted &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four men arrested last month for allegedly participating in
a &#8220;criminal club&#8221; of inside traders that reaped almost $62
million from Dell Inc. shares were indicted by a federal grand
jury in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One trade earned a $53 million illegal windfall for Level
Global Investors LP co-founder Anthony Chiasson and his fund,
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara alleged. The ring, which
involved five hedge funds and investment firms, is the largest
identified by the U.S. to date tied to a single stock, federal
authorities said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiasson; Todd Newman, a portfolio manager formerly at
Diamondback Capital Management LLC; Jon Horvath, a hedge fund
analyst in New York; and Danny Kuo, a fund manager for Whittier
Trust Co. in South Pasadena, California, were all named
yesterday in an indictment filed in federal court in New York.
They were charged in total with one count of conspiracy to
commit securities fraud and nine counts of securities fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a federal grand jury returned the indictment, the
case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illegal profits earned from the scheme were almost of the
same &#8220;magnitude of fraud we proved in the Galleon Group insider
trading scheme,&#8221; Bharara said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A five-year insider-trading probe by Bharara&#8217;s office and
the Federal Bureau of Investigation in New York called &#8220;Perfect
Hedge&#8221; has resulted in charges against 63 people, said Janice
Fedarcyk, head of the FBI&#8217;s New York office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 50 have pleaded guilty or been convicted after
trial since 2009, including Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj
Rajaratnam, who is serving an 11-year prison sentence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three men who were charged in the scheme to illegally trade
in Dell stock have pleaded guilty and are cooperating with the
U.S. -- Jesse Tortora of Diamondback; Spyridon &#8220;Sam&#8221;
Adondakis, a Level Global analyst; and Sandeep Goyal, a former
Dell employee, according to Bharara and court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. Newman, 12-cr-121, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The
civil case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Adondakis,
12-409, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BNP Paribas Wins Dismissal of Unauthorized Trades Lawsuit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNP Paribas SA (BNP)&#8217;s wealth management unit won dismissal of a
lawsuit filed by Nitine Jantilal, a former client who claimed
the bank made unauthorized trades leading to a shortfall in his
account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jantilal sued the bank in 2009 over allegations that a
S$1.1 million ($883,000) reduction in his account was due to the
bank&#8217;s breaches. The Indian national had made two of his
relatives co-signatories of his account and claimed he was
unaware of trades based on instructions from them, Singapore
High Court Judge Choo Han Teck said in a ruling yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jantilal &#8220;assumed the risk of making his relatives
authorized signatories. He cannot now say that he did not
authorize them,&#8221; Judge Choo said. BNP Paribas &#8220;executed the
specific asset transactions and swap transactions with the
proper authority.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decline in asset value in Jantilal&#8217;s account was due to
trades made by his authorized signatories and market
fluctuations, according to the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K. Muralidharan Pillai represented the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Nitine Jantilal v. BNP Paribas Wealth
Management S1048/2009 in the Singapore High Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;States With Highest Foreclosure Rates Among Bank Deal Holdouts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California, New York, Nevada, Florida and Massachusetts are
among the states that haven&#8217;t signed off on a settlement with
banks over foreclosure abuses, according to state officials and
two people familiar with the talks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holdouts include some with the highest rates of
foreclosures. More than 6 percent of Nevada housing units had at
least one foreclosure filing in 2011, the nation&#8217;s highest rate,
according to RealtyTrac. California was third-highest with more
than 3 percent, said the firm, which tracks foreclosures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California Attorney General Kamala Harris and New York
Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who have been among the most
outspoken in pushing for changes to the accord, were among those
who hadn&#8217;t joined as of a Feb. 6 deadline. More than 40 states
signed on, said Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, who is helping
to lead talks with the banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Adding more numbers probably improves the political
dimension of the settlement from the standpoint of the attorneys
general,&#8221; said Ken Scott, a Stanford University law professor.
&#8220;If you can say there were only a handful of diehards that
didn&#8217;t sign on, that gives you some political protection.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All 50 states announced almost 16 months ago they were
investigating bank foreclosure practices following disclosures
that faulty documents were being used to seize homes. Officials
from states and federal agencies, including the Justice
Department, have since negotiated terms of a proposed settlement
with five banks that is said to be worth as much as $25 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley and Florida
Attorney General Pam Bondi hadn&#8217;t joined as of yesterday, said
the two people, who declined to be identified because the matter
isn&#8217;t public. Delaware and Nevada also hadn&#8217;t agreed to the
settlement as of Feb. 6, according to their offices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller said federal and state officials continue to discuss
the proposed deal and its terms with the banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Wells Fargo
 Co. (WFC) made a last-minute demand that New York drop claims filed
against them Feb. 3 as a condition of the settlement, a person
familiar with that case said. The push by the three banks raised
an obstacle in getting Schneiderman&#8217;s support for the deal, said
the person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York sued Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo in
state court in Brooklyn, saying their use of a mortgage database
known as MERS led to improper foreclosures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for Schneiderman, declined to
comment on the demand by the banks over the MERS lawsuit.
Schneiderman, who was scheduled to make remarks on the
settlement talks yesterday, postponed the conference call
indefinitely, according to a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Rodgers, a spokesman for New York-based Citigroup; Tom
Goyda of San Francisco-based Wells Fargo; Tom Kelly, a spokesman
at New York-based JPMorgan; and Gina Proia of Detroit-based Ally
Financial declined to comment on the proposed settlement terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re interested in finding a path forward with a
comprehensive settlement that benefits homeowners and
communities,&#8221; said Dan Frahm, a spokesman for Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America, declining to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;News Corp.&#8217;s Times Mislead U.K. Court About Computer Hacking &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News Corp. (NWSA)&#8217;s Times newspaper in London misled a court and
lawyers for a police officer who suspected his e-mail account
had been hacked by a reporter, editor James Harding told a media
inquiry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the last couple of weeks, I&#8217;ve learned a great deal
more about what happened in this incident,&#8221; Harding told the
inquiry that was set up in response to the phone-hacking scandal
at News Corp.&#8217;s now defunct News of the World. &#8220;I sorely regret
the intrusion.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reporter Patrick Foster hacked into officer Richard
Horton&#8217;s e-mail in May 2009 to expose him as the writer of an
unauthorized &#8220;Nightjack&#8221; blog about police work. Lawyers for
Horton, to prevent the story from being published, raised the
possibility that the e-mail had been illegally accessed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foster told his editor and the newsroom&#8217;s lawyer who
advised him to continue to pursue the story through legitimate
means and told Horton&#8217;s counsel that his identity was revealed
through deduction, Harding said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Metropolitan Police Service is investigating the Times
over e-mail hacking, Labour party lawmaker Tom Watson said in an
e-mail last week. The paper is the third News Corp. title in
London to come under suspicion in related probes of phone
hacking, computer hacking and bribes to police officers. The
scandal erupted in July after revelations that the News of the
World accessed messages on a murdered schoolgirl&#8217;s mobile phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foster didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;UBS Says Swiss Regulator Granted Immunity in Libor Investigation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS AG (UBSN) said it was given immunity from a second antitrust
regulator as part of an investigation into whether the London
Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, was manipulated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank has conditional immunity from the Swiss
Competition Commission regarding submissions for Yen Libor,
Euroyen Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate, or Tibor, and Swiss franc
Libor rates, the bank said in a regulatory filing yesterday. UBS
was granted similar immunity by the U.S. Department of Justice
in regards to Yen Libor and Euroyen Tibor because it is
cooperating with the probe, the Zurich-based bank said last
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS won&#8217;t be prosecuted, fined, or face other sanctions
from the Swiss regulator if it continues to cooperate, it said.
The regulator said last week that it was investigating 12 banks,
including UBS and Credit Suisse Group AG, over how the benchmark
for about $350 trillion of financial products is set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Justice Department,
Japan&#8217;s Financial Supervisory Agency and the U.K. Financial
Services Authority are investigating whether there were attempts
to manipulate Libor rates. European Union antitrust regulators
are also examining Libor rates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Google Removes Search, YouTube Content on Indian Court Order &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) removed content from its India domains that was
deemed objectionable by a New Delhi district court after a civil
lawsuit against the owner of the world&#8217;s largest search engine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The material was blocked from India search results,
YouTube, Blogger and the social-networking site Orkut, said
Gaurav Bhaskar, a spokesman for Google India. The content was
deleted from domains .in and .co.in, while remaining accessible
from other countries, Bhaskar said yesterday. Google can&#8217;t take
down content that appears on websites owned by other companies
and individuals, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India is stepping up scrutiny of Internet postings and
mobile communications as it tries to eliminate provocative
comments and curb discord between religious groups. The Hindu-
majority South Asian country is home to more than 138 million
Muslims, comprising about 13 percent of the world&#8217;s second-
largest population. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This step is in accordance with Google&#8217;s long-standing
policy of responding to court orders,&#8221; the company said in an
e-mailed statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement didn&#8217;t provide details about the lawsuit or
the content that was removed, and Bhaskar didn&#8217;t elaborate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The order follows a civil complaint filed by Mufti Aijaz
Arshad Quasmi, an Indian activist who seeks the removal of
videos and images that could be seen as offensive to Muslims,
his lawyer Santosh Pandey said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Raytheon Executive Fined in $1 Billion FAA Contract Lawsuit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Raytheon Co. (RTN) executive was fined by a Washington court
for failing to give opponents in a lawsuit a reprimand letter
stemming from an affair with a subordinate while both worked at
the Federal Aviation Administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles E. Keegan, leader of Raytheon&#8217;s Civil Aviation
Solutions division, violated a court order to turn over to
Washington Consulting Group Inc. the document showing he had an
improper romantic relationship with the woman, Judge A. Franklin
Burgess Jr. of the District of Columbia Superior Court ruled
Feb. 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past two years, Washington Consulting Group, or
WCG, has argued that the relationship began at the FAA, and
continued after Keegan left for Raytheon and Maureen Knopes, now
Keegan&#8217;s wife, became responsible for a contracting program to
train air traffic controllers. WCG held the contract for more
than 20 years until Raytheon won it in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bethesda, Maryland-based company is seeking $1 billion
in damages from Raytheon and Keegan, claiming the relationship
contaminated the bidding process on the 10-year contract. Keegan
and his wife, now Knopes-Keegan, conspired with others to
reconfigure the FAA&#8217;s contracting program and stole WCG&#8217;s trade
secrets to ensure Raytheon would take the business, the lawsuit
claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Though it is faced with conflicting evidence as to
whether Keegan&#8217;s failure to produce the reprimand letter was
inadvertent or intentional, the court reaches the same
conclusion in either case,&#8221; the judge said, ordering Keegan to
pay a portion of legal fees to opposing counsel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The couple&#8217;s romance was investigated by the Transportation
Department&#8217;s inspector general. In 2004, a top FAA official
reprimanded Keegan in a letter for having an &#8220;inappropriate
relationship&#8221; that created a &#8220;perception of favoritism&#8221; and
the appearance of &#8220;giving preferential treatment&#8221; to Knopes-
Keegan, according to the judge&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter wasn&#8217;t disclosed to WCG until Keegan was being
interviewed in the case in December. Keegan said in court
filings that the document was found in a box in his basement
that contained work papers along with a weather dial and a
runner&#8217;s bib. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These rulings are unrelated to the merits of the case,&#8221;
Jon Kasle, a spokesman for Waltham, Massachusetts-based
Raytheon, said in an e-mail. &#8220;Raytheon continues to maintain
that WCG&#8217;s suit is without merit,&#8221; he said, adding that the
company is reviewing the rulings and will defend itself and
Keegan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Thomas, a lawyer for WCG, said in an e-mail the
ruling means Raytheon &#8220;now must face public scrutiny of its
misconduct.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Washington Consulting Group Inc. v. Raytheon
Technical Services Co. LLC, 10-00296, Superior Court of the
District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hong Kong Regulator Says It Should Be Able to Redress Investors &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong&#8217;s securities regulator, whose attempt to ban New
York-based hedge fund Tiger Asia Management LLC last year from
trading was blocked by a court, said it should have the right to
redress investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If private individuals can seek civil remedies, why does
the SFC have to wait?&#8221; Benjamin Yu, a lawyer representing the
Securities and Futures Commission, told Hong Kong&#8217;s Court of
Appeal yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator is trying to overturn a court ruling that it
lacks the power to unwind Tiger Asia&#8217;s transactions in the
market and ban the hedge fund and employees from trading in Hong
Kong before proving insider trading allegations in a tribunal or
criminal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SFC alleges the hedge fund traded on inside information
from bankers arranging placements of China Construction Bank
Corp. (939) and Bank of China Ltd. shares in 2008 and 2009, pocketing
HK$38.5 million ($4.9 million). Tiger Asia, which has no
employees and physical presence in Hong Kong, denied the
allegations in an Oct. 12, 2010 letter to investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legal battle, which both the SFC and Tiger Asia&#8217;s
founder Bill Hwang have pledged to take to Hong Kong&#8217;s top
court, will determine whether the agency can sue independently
for relief without working through government departments to
bring a criminal case or civil inquiry. Tiger Asia&#8217;s lawyers
argue the regulator can&#8217;t use a provision for freezing assets to
bring its own lawsuit against them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was never intended that the SFC should have an
unchecked ability to seek a contravention of market
misconduct,&#8221; Charles Sussex, representing Tiger Asia and its
officers, argued before the court yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Criminal proceedings or a civil tribunal inquiry &#8220;are not
preconditions to investors taking action,&#8221; said Judge Robert
Tang from the bench yesterday. &#8220;If small investors don&#8217;t have
to wait, why should the SFC have to wait?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three appeals court judges reserved their judgment and
will hand down their decision at a later date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Securities and Futures Commission and Tiger
Asia Management LLC, Sung Kook Hwang Bill, Raymond Park, William
Tomita, CACV178/2011 in the Hong Kong Court of Appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some Stanford Assets Were Profitable, Ex-CFO Tells Jurors &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R. Allen Stanford&#8217;s businesses collapsed in part because
the stock market imploded and a court-appointed receiver
destroyed much of the companies&#8217; value after they were seized by
the government, Ex-Stanford Financial Group Co. finance chief
James M. Davis told jurors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis, testifying yesterday for the government under a plea
deal at Stanford&#8217;s federal court trial in Houston, was shown a
letter he wrote shortly after regulators seized Stanford&#8217;s
companies in February 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There was from the start never a thought to put the
clients in harm&#8217;s way in this process, never a hint of criminal
intent,&#8221; Robert Scardino, a lawyer for Stanford, read from the
letter, which Davis said he wrote to an attorney he was trying
to hire to defend him at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The underlying global business growth model remained
strong,&#8221; Davis wrote in the letter, adding that some of
Stanford&#8217;s businesses were moving toward profitability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that 180 degrees opposite from what you&#8217;ve been
telling this jury?&#8221; Scardino asked Davis. &#8220;You said these
companies had no value.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis responded, &#8220;A number of the companies Stanford owned
were growing; they were worth something.&#8221; The 2009 letter
&#8220;could be true under certain circumstances,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former finance chief told jurors he changed his mind a
month after writing that letter, when he met with his current
attorney, who persuaded him to seek a plea deal. &#8220;But at the
time I was still lying,&#8221; he said of the letter. &#8220;I was still
in the middle of it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis&#8217;s testimony may bolster Stanford&#8217;s defense that he
never intended to defraud investors of $7 billion through what
the government says was a Ponzi scheme built on bogus
certificates of deposit at Antigua-based Stanford International
Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford&#8217;s lawyers claim accountants were in the process of
consolidating companies the financier funded with $2 billion in
secret bank loans onto the Antiguan bank&#8217;s portfolio when
regulators stepped in and stopped the process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. Stanford, 09-cr-00342, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston). The SEC
case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Stanford
International Bank, 09-cv-00298, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of Texas (Dallas). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New Suits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Acer Sues Former Chief Lanci Over Non-Compete Clause &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acer Inc. (2353) sued former president and chief executive officer
Gianfranco Lanci in an Italian court seeking damages for breach
of a non-compete clause, the Taipei-based company said in an e-
mailed statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lanci left Acer last year after helming the company for
more than six years. Rival Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) in September
announced he would join the company as a consultant, and last
month named him head of its newly-created Europe, Middle-East
and Africa unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acer Chairman J.T. Wang and Lanci met March 28 last year to
agree on the terms of the Italian&#8217;s departure after they
couldn&#8217;t resolve disagreements over the company&#8217;s future
direction, Wang said in a May interview. Lanci&#8217;s resignation was
announced three days later, exposing a feud between the two
sides over product strategy and internationalization of the
Taiwanese company. Lanci confirmed accounts of that meeting in a
separate interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe Mr. Lanci has breached his non-compete
measures agreed into willingly by both parties when he left
Acer,&#8221; the company said in yesterday&#8217;s statement.  We are
taking legal action against him in order to protect Acer&#8217;s
rights and interests.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls to Lanci&#8217;s Italian mobile phone and e-mail to his
personal account weren&#8217;t answered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Reaches Tentative Settlement in AFTRA Pension Suit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. and the American Federation of
Television and Radio Artists Retirement Fund reached an
&#8220;agreement in principal&#8221; to settle a suit claiming losses from
the bank&#8217;s securities lending program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement is to be announced on the plaintiffs&#8217;
website, according to a statement provided yesterday by
Stephanie Cirkovich, a spokeswoman for the federal court in
Manhattan, where the AFTRA fund filed its suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The parties are drafting a formal settlement agreement,
to be submitted to the court for approval within approximately
three weeks,&#8221; according to the statement. &#8220;The settlement
terms will remain confidential until the agreement is submitted
to the court.&#160;The settlement is subject to the court&#8217;s approval
and to certain other conditions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund sued in 2009, claiming it lost money that New
York-based JPMorgan invested for it in medium-term notes issued
by Sigma Finance Corp., a structured investment vehicle that
collapsed in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Board of Trustees of the AFTRA Retirement Fund
v. JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 09-cv-686, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;California Gay Marriage Ban Ruled Unlawful by Appeals Court &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California&#8217;s voter-backed Proposition 8 law declaring
marriage to be only between a man and a woman was ruled
unconstitutional by a federal appeals court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco-based court, ruling 2-1, yesterday upheld
the 2010 decision of a federal court judge who said the measure
violated constitutional equal protection rights of same-sex
couples. That ruling came in the first federal trial over
whether it&#8217;s legal to ban marriage by gays and lesbians. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The people may not employ the initiative power to single
out a disfavored group for unequal treatment and strip them,
without a legitimate justification, of a right as important as
the right to marry,&#8221; the U.S. Court of Appeals said in its
ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents and advocates of Proposition 8 had appealed the
decision of U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker in San Francisco.
They argued that that the measure, which was approved by 52
percent of California voters in 2008 after the California
Supreme Court legalized gay marriage, reflected the traditional
definition of marriage and furthered the state&#8217;s interests in
&#8220;responsible procreation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court yesterday kept in place its earlier order
putting Walker&#8217;s ruling on hold. Proposition 8 proponents said
they will continue their court battle to uphold the measure and
hope to win in the U.S. Supreme Court (1000L). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are not surprised that this Hollywood-orchestrated
attack on marriage -- tried in San Francisco -- turned out this
way,&#8221; Brian Raum, an attorney for proponents and senior counsel
at the legal group Alliance Defense Fund, said in an e-mail.
&#8220;But we are confident that the expressed will of the American
people in favor of marriage will be upheld at the Supreme
Court.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Every pro-marriage American should be pleased that this
case can finally go to the U.S. Supreme Court (1000L),&#8221; Raum said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carla Hass, another attorney for the Proposition 8
proponents, said her clients were deciding whether to petition
for a rehearing of the case before a larger panel of appeals
court judges, or petition the Supreme Court for review without
delay. An immediate appeal to the high court would allow for a
hearing during the nine-month term that starts in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court in San Francisco could decide on its own
to rehear the case before more judges, Hass said in a phone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Perry v. Brown, 11-17255 and 11-16577, U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;GlaxoSmithKline Among Companies Paying $25 Million to State &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actavis Group HF and Merck  Co. Inc.&#8217;s Schering-Plough
were among five companies that paid a total of $25.2 million to
settle claims that they overcharged Louisiana for drugs for low-
income patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two companies and Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Dey Pharma
LP and GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) resolved civil claims that they
inflated drug prices to get larger reimbursements from the
state&#8217;s Medicaid program, Louisiana Attorney General James
&#8220;Buddy&#8221; Caldwell said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. The
state claimed the companies misreported average wholesale prices
for the drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louisiana has sued more than 100 drug companies, accusing
them of fraud and violating the state&#8217;s unfair trade practices
and consumer protection law. The statement didn&#8217;t specify the
amount that each company is paying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives of GlaxoSmithKline, Actavis, Boehringer
Ingelheim and Dey Pharma didn&#8217;t immediately return phone calls.
Ron Rogers, a spokesman for Merck, didn&#8217;t have an immediate
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fourteen Hospitals Reach $12 Million False Claims Accord &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourteen hospitals in New York and six other states agreed
to pay more than $12 million in total to settle allegations that
they submitted false claims to Medicare, the U.S. Justice
Department said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four hospitals affiliated with Adventist Health
System/Sunbelt Inc. in Florida will pay the largest sum, $3.9
million, according to an e-mailed statement by the Justice
Department. Plainview Hospital in Plainview, New York, will pay
$2.3 million, the largest single hospital payment, the agency
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement resolves civil claims that the hospitals
overcharged Medicare for eight years starting in 2000 for the
cost of performing kyphoplasty procedures, which treat spinal
fractures due to osteoporosis. In total, more than 40 hospitals
have paid at least $39 million to settle such overbilling
claims, the Justice Department said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;By recovering taxpayer dollars lost to improper billing,
this settlement will help support the vital public health care
programs we depend on,&#8221; Assistant Attorney General Tony West
said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlements follow a 2008 whistle-blower lawsuit
brought under the False Claims Act by two men who had worked for
Kyphon Inc., a maker of surgical equipment. The men, a former
regional sales manager and an ex-reimbursement manager, will
collect a total $2.1 million from the settlements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plainview Hospital, which is part of the North Shore-Long
Island Jewish Health System, said in a statement that the
dispute concerned &#8220;technical billing allegations,&#8221; and it
denied violating the law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Settlement without any admission of liability avoids the
significant costs and distraction of litigation against the
government,&#8221; the hospital said. Representatives of Adventist
Health System didn&#8217;t immediately respond to phone calls seeking
comment on the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Court News &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rajaratnam Judge Announces Departure in Press Release &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. judge who sentenced Raj Rajaratnam to 11 years in
prison for insider trading after a trial where he often closed
proceedings and sealed files used a public relations firm to
announce he was quitting the bench. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Holwell, 65, revealed his departure yesterday in a
press release advertising the creation of his new Manhattan law
firm, Holwell Shuster  Goldberg. The announcement was
circulated by Hellerman Baretz Communications LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to a question last week on reports he planned
to leave the judiciary, Holwell said he told a court spokeswoman
it&#8217;s not his practice &#8220;to talk about my future plans.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I gave the chief judge a heads-up a week or two ago,&#8221;
Holwell said yesterday in an interview, referring to U.S.
District Judge Loretta Preska. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think it was
appropriate to ask the court to issue a press release,&#8221; Holwell
said. &#8220;I thought I should be the guy to do it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement comes a day after Holwell published his
last ruling in the Rajaratnam case, a 39-page opinion giving the
reasons for how he calculated the applicable federal sentencing
guidelines. The hedge fund manager&#8217;s sentence was the longest in
U.S. history for insider trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holwell said he wanted to finish that ruling before leaving
the bench, along with a decision in a securities case against
Vivendi SA (VIV) and another denying a request to block toll increases
on New York-area bridges and tunnels. His new firm opened
yesterday, according to the press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holwell spent more than 30 years as an attorney with White
 Case LLP (1116L) in Manhattan before President George W. Bush
appointed him to the federal bench in 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holwell&#8217;s new firm includes Michael Shuster and Daniel
Goldberg, lawyers he practiced with at White  Case. Holwell
Shuster  Goldberg plans to represent clients in complex
commercial, securities, antitrust and bankruptcy litigation,
according to the press release. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey may see more of its companies
acquired as buyers raise offers to match premiums demanded by
sellers, according to Utku Ozay, an executive director at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The gap between valuations and buyers is decreasing, and
that&#8217;s basically because buyers are increasing their
valuations,&#8221; Ozay said at a conference on acquisition finance
in Istanbul yesterday. &#8220;For the right story, there is
willingness to pay more for Turkish companies. Prices are
increasing, the multiples are increasing, so we may see more
deals.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkey had 114 mergers and acquisitions worth $9.3 billion
last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The country
may attract between $12 billion and $13 billion in 2012, Ilker
Ayci, head of the Investment Support and Promotion Agency, told
Hurriyet newspaper in December. The figure could reach as much
as $26 billion, according to Istanbul-based brokerage BGC
Partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failure to close deals in Turkey in the past has been
largely due to unwillingness to pay the premiums Turkish sellers
demand, Ozay said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not a lack of interest, it&#8217;s basically not being
able to come to an agreement on valuation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkish deal flow may also be increased by conglomerates
selling off assets to invest in energy and infrastructure, which
are expected to be key growth areas in Turkey, according to
Mustafa Tiftikcioglu, senior vice president in charge of project
and acquisition finance at Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS, who was
also speaking at the seminar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Conglomerates who want to take significant positions in
energy or infrastructure will dispose of non-core assets,&#8221; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than $10 billion of Turkish energy grid privatizations
last year were canceled after the winning bidders at auction
failed to make the down-payments necessary to complete the
transactions, indicating difficulty funding the deals, Ozay
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In Turkey, buyers tend to look for financing after they
win the asset,&#8221; Ozay said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Jody Shenn" date="Feb 09, 2012  4:20 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-09/goldman-sachs-retained-most-of-fed-s-mortgage-bonds-it-bought-data-show.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Kept Almost All of Mortgage Bonds Bought From Fed, Data Show</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. held on to
almost all of the $6.2 billion in face value of mortgage bonds
that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York sold the company
yesterday, based on data from Trace, the transaction reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers bought $961 million of speculative-grade home-
loan bonds from dealers yesterday while selling $6.9 billion,
according to the data. Trading of investment-grade debt totaled
$385 million, while dealers traded about $45 million of both
types of bonds among themselves, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It certainly looks like they&#8217;re willing to provide
liquidity to the market by bidding for their own account,&#8221; said
Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Montgomery
Scott LLC in Philadelphia. &#8220;It&#8217;s a little bit of shift,&#8221; after
a period in which dealers reduced their inventories, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the most profitable securities firm in Wall
Street history before converting to a bank in 2008, won an
auction of bonds assumed in the U.S. central bank&#8217;s rescue of
American International Group Inc. (AIG) after the New York Fed put the
pool out for competitive bidding following an offer from Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN), the New York Fed said yesterday in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weighted average price of non-investment grade, or
junk, securities traded yesterday was 57.8 cents on the dollar,
according to Trace data. High-yield, or junk, bonds are rated
lower than Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and below BBB- by
Standard  Poor&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Jan. 19, when Credit Suisse won the New York Fed&#8217;s last
auction of bonds from its AIG-tied Maiden Lane II vehicle,
customers bought $4.7 billion of home-loan bonds with junk
ratings from dealers and sold $6.7 billion, the data showed. The
central bank sold $7 billion of securities that day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our intention has always been to distribute the portfolio
to our clients globally and we are in the midst of doing that,&#8221;
Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman Sachs,
said today in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) raised $1.4 billion
in its fourth bond sale within a year as the biggest U.S.
entertainment company by market value takes advantage of
corporate bond yields at about record lows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company issued $1 billion of 1.125 percent, five-year
notes that yield 47 basis points above similar-maturity
Treasuries and $400 million of 2.55 percent, 10-year debt at a
62 basis-point spread, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Before today&#8217;s offering, Burbank, California-based Disney had
sold $3.95 billion of bonds since May, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney joined blue-chip American companies from Procter 
Gamble Co. to McDonald&#8217;s Corp. in snagging borrowing costs at
almost all-time lows as the Federal Reserve pledges to hold
interest rates near zero percent through at least late 2014.
Average yields on investment-grade debt sank to 3.53 percent
yesterday, 8 basis points above the record low of 3.45 percent
reached in August, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve obviously increased our debt because of the
availability of money at these great rates,&#8221; Chief Financial
Officer James Rasulo said in a Feb. 7 conference call to discuss
earnings. &#8220;For what we borrowed in both the amounts and our
rating, we really almost always in the past year saw
historically low coupon rates on that debt.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company cut borrowing costs on both of its issues
today, Bloomberg data show. Disney offered $750 million of 1.35
percent, five-year notes in August, a record low at that time,
and $750 million of 2.75 percent, 10-year debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Timing Debt Issues &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Disney&#8217;s previous bond sale in November, the company set
a 0.875 percent coupon on $1 billion of three-year notes, its
lowest ever, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve timed our steps into the debt marketplace very
carefully and put a lot of time into picking what we think will
be a low entry points and we&#8217;ve been very successful in doing
that,&#8221; Rasulo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the string of offerings in the past year, Disney had
last tapped the market in 2009 for $500 million of 5.5 percent
notes, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is graded A2 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and
an equivalent A by Standard  Poor&#8217;s and Fitch Ratings,
Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney has room to issue more debt while maintaining its
single-A credit grade, which &#8220;served us incredibly well over
the past decade including when liquidity dried up for most
companies in 2008,&#8221; Rasulo said in the conference call this
week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve got a couple of maturities that we&#8217;d like to fill
in and when we see the opportunity to step in at great rates I
think you&#8217;ll see us doing that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As time passes
we&#8217;ll have some maturities that we&#8217;ll refill but don&#8217;t expect us
to back the truck up to the point where we have to give up that
great debt, that great balance sheet and great Standard  Poor&#8217;s
rating.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobel-prize winning economist Paul Krugman isn&#8217;t paying enough attention to growing U.S. government
debt as he promotes deficit spending, Columbia University
professor Jeffrey Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Krugman has staked out a rather crude Keynesian position
and unrelentingly so,&#8221; Sachs said today, referring to John Maynard Keynes, the British economist who advocated government
spending to spur economic growth during the Great Depression.
Krugman &#8220;knows one thing, which is stimulus, stimulus, stimulus
and expand deficit spending,&#8221; Sachs said in a television
interview on &#8220;Bloomberg Surveillance&#8221; with Ken Prewitt and Tom Keene. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total federal debt held by the public has more than doubled
as a share of gross domestic product in the last decade. It
totaled 72 percent of GDP last year, compared with 35 percent in
2000, according to calculations by the Office of Management and
Budget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krugman didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mail or
telephone request seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Feb. 6, Krugman, a professor at Princeton University and
a New York Times columnist, wrote in his &#8220;Economics and
Politics&#8221; blog that the U.S. economy was in a depression
because an excess supply of savings prevented full employment.
Government spending would help &#8220;reduce that incipient
surplus,&#8221; he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Paul has a powerful bully pulpit in his New York Times
column, and he&#8217;s been on one theme for three years,&#8221; Sachs
said. Krugman has &#8220;under-emphasized the risks of growing debt,
he&#8217;s over-asserted what we really know about the effects of
these policies and he has underestimated the long-term need for
public-sector change and reform,&#8221; Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Warring &#8216;Ideologues&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, Krugman is &#8220;battling ideologues on the other
side who have been equally extreme,&#8221; Sachs said. &#8220;This brawl
is really a brawl of extreme positions,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not
very illuminating, but it is rather entertaining.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offering Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney
advice, Sachs said that &#8220;simply cutting government spending in
order to be able to enable tax cuts is going to be seen as
terribly unfair.&#8221; Such a policy wouldn&#8217;t address the need for
more investment in education, research and development, and
infrastructure, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will begin handing
out test versions of Windows 8 computers running chips with ARM
Holdings Plc (ARM)&#8217;s technology, part of its push to release devices
that can compete with Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPad tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft wants ARM-based devices to go on sale at the same
time as computers sporting chips from Intel Corp. (INTC) The ARM-based
test computers, featuring chips made by Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM), Texas
Instruments Inc. (TXN) and Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), will go to partners and
software developers in the next several weeks, Microsoft Windows
President Steven Sinofsky said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first broadly available test version of Windows 8 will
be distributed Feb. 29, and Microsoft has so far only provided
developers with machines running Intel&#8217;s chips. Because the
company also wants the next version of its operating system to
gain a foothold in the tablet-computer market dominated by ARM-
based machines like the iPad, it&#8217;s important for Microsoft to
have an ARM product available quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s Windows unit is releasing a personal-computer
operating system for the first time that runs on ARM chips.
Previous versions of Windows for PCs have run on x86 chips from
Intel and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Still, Microsoft should be
able to get ARM-based products in stores at the same time,
Sinofsky said, while declining to comment on when the products
will be released. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Release Target &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our collective goal is for them to ship at the same time
as PCs with Windows 8 on x86,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be saying
it&#8217;s a goal if I didn&#8217;t think we could do it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sinofsky will discuss Microsoft&#8217;s efforts to release
Windows with ARM technology in an approximately 8,000-word blog
post today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, will start to
distribute thousands of the test machines around the same time
it unveils the Windows 8 Consumer Preview at a mobile conference
in Barcelona, Spain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from Windows software, which runs most of the
world&#8217;s PCs, has missed analysts&#8217; estimates in four of the past
five quarters, in part because some consumers are defecting from
laptops with Windows to tablets like the iPad. Microsoft
probably won&#8217;t be able to significantly change that trend until
Windows 8 goes on sale, Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein said
in an interview last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Preinstalled Software &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows on ARM will only be sold preinstalled on computers
and all applications and updates for the product will be
distributed through the Windows apps store only, Sinofsky said.
That&#8217;s different from the x86 version, which will also be
available for purchase separately from the hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That lets Microsoft closely control how the ARM machines
run and ensure that everything works -- akin to other
electronics, such as TV set-top boxes and game consoles, which
are built and sold with hardware and software in the same
package. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will include versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint
and the OneNote note-taking application on the Windows on ARM
devices, Sinofsky said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with x86 machines, Windows 8 on ARM will let users
choose either the new Metro design, which features tiles that
update with new information, or revert to the current Windows
design, Sinofsky said. Unlike x86, the ARM machines won&#8217;t be
able to run older applications such as those written for the
current version of Windows, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you are a customer, whether an enterprise or an
individual, and there is an existing Windows program you
absolutely have to run, you&#8217;ll be best served by a PC with one
of the Intel or AMD chips that can run that software,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attendance at the Amfar benefit last
night at Cipriani Wall Street showed the organization&#8217;s base of
support in the fashion, beauty and entertainment industries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woody Allen, nominated for several Academy Awards for
&#8220;Midnight in Paris,&#8221; stuck close to Mathilde Krim, founding
chairman of the American Foundation for AIDS Research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rocker Debbie Harry sat with John Demsey, who oversees the
M.A.C. Viva Glam brand, the event&#8217;s presenting sponsor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heidi Klum, Cindy Crawford, Rose Byrne, and Julianne Moore
were some of the beauties scattered about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the center of the room -- the prime spot for taking
in the performances by Janelle Monae and Theophilus London --
were the folks from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), whose partners
last year gave $1 million to the organization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The donations followed a speech at Goldman by Kevin Frost,
Amfar&#8217;s chief executive officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I invited Kevin to come to the trading floor, right at
market close,&#8221; Marty Chavez, a Goldman Sachs partner, said. &#8220;I
told him we had an ADD crowd, to use as many numbers as possible
and that he only had 15 minutes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chavez, an Amfar board member, then followed with &#8220;the
ask,&#8221; sending an e-mail with a link to the company&#8217;s intranet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It took you to the page where you put in the amount you
want to give,&#8221; Chavez said. &#8220;It was the easiest thing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goldman Gives &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partners made their donations through Goldman Sachs Gives,
the firm&#8217;s donor-advised fund. As Chavez explained, Goldman
Sachs partners receive an allocation to direct to Goldman Sachs
Gives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You can&#8217;t direct it to just anything,&#8221; Chavez said. The
fund has four focus areas: honoring service and veterans;
building and stabilizing communities (under which the Amfar
donation fell); increasing educational opportunities; and
creating jobs and economic growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frost recalled the talk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Marty gave me 15 minutes to tell people what I believe
in,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I believe with the right investments, and the
right political will, we can cure AIDS in our lifetime. It&#8217;s not
a pipe dream, it&#8217;s what the science says.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frost noted that a research grant costs $150,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Right now we only fund half of what scores as fundable,&#8221;
Frost said. &#8220;So we&#8217;re leaving 50 percent on the shelf.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colleen Foster, a Goldman Sachs partner, was one of the
people on the trading floor that afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are exposed to many world-class organizations,&#8221;
Foster said. &#8220;Amfar was the most compelling, inspiring
presentation I attended. You really got a sense of the impact.
And they were very approachable, very real.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the largest software
maker, said it would be &#8220;fair and reasonable&#8221; in licensing its
industry-standard technology, pledging to negotiate with
competitors instead of trying to block sales of their products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also will make its industry-essential patents
available without requiring companies to cross-license their own
non-essential technology, according to a posting yesterday on
the company&#8217;s website. The pledge comes as Google Inc. prepares
a similar promise to appease regulators scrutinizing its
acquisition of Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility has sued Microsoft and Apple Inc. (AAPL) for
infringing patents that are covered partly by standards in which
companies agree to share technology that is common across their
industry. Google, which has drawn scrutiny over the acquisition,
plans to send the letter to standards organizations reassuring
them it will license Motorola Mobility patents on fair terms,
according to two people with knowledge of the situation who
asked not to be named because the decision isn&#8217;t yet public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s statement didn&#8217;t name any companies, and a
spokesman for the software maker, Kevin Kutz, declined to
comment. Jennifer Erickson, a spokeswoman for Libertyville,
Illinois-based Motorola Mobility, and Kristin Huguet of Apple
also wouldn&#8217;t comment. Jim Prosser, a spokesman for Google in
Mountain View, California, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-
mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility has sought sales bans in Germany on Apple
products using standard-essential patents, and is seeking to
halt U.S. imports of Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox gaming system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s policy announced today doesn&#8217;t bar the company
from seeking bans on the use of patented technology that isn&#8217;t
part of an industry standard or from suing to demand
compensation for the use of the essential patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple, based in Cupertino, California, sent a letter in
November to the European Telecommunications Standards Institute
saying the &#8220;industry suffers from a lack of consistent
adherence&#8221; to policies that require companies to license
standard-essential patents on &#8220;fair, reasonable and non-
discriminatory&#8221; terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that letter, reported yesterday by the Wall Street
Journal, Apple said companies that pledge to license their
patents on fair terms can&#8217;t seek to prevent use of the
inventions without being in violation of their commitment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Facebook CEO Won&#8217;t Have to Answer Questions in Patent Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc. (FB) Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg won&#8217;t
have to give pretrial testimony in a patent-infringement lawsuit
filed by a mobile networking company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel in Manhattan yesterday
denied a request by Wireless Ink Corp. to depose Facebook co-
founder Zuckerberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the CEO of Facebook has relevant knowledge not readily
available from other sources, Wireless Ink ought to be able to
establish this from documents produced in discovery or the
testimony of other employees of Facebook,&#8221; Castel said in his
order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wireless Ink, which operates the Winksite social networking
service, said in a complaint filed in 2010 that Facebook Mobile
and Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Google Buzz infringed a patent related to ways
of offering content on mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook&#8217;s lawyers said in a letter to the judge that
Wireless Ink &#8220;has not identified any relevant knowledge that
Mr. Zuckerberg uniquely possesses that cannot be obtained from
other witnesses.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook, based in Menlo Park, California, is planning an
initial public offering of stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Wireless Ink Corp. v. Facebook Inc., 10-01841,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USPTO&#8217;s &#8216;Patents for Humanity&#8217; Prize to Speed Up Office Process &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has set up a project
that will move some patent owners to the head of the line for
proceedings within the office if their patented technology has
been used for neglected humanitarian issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;Patent for Humanity&#8221; project, which will run for 12
months, is aimed at public health  or quality-of-life issues
affected the poor, the patent office said in a statement
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judges, drawn from academia in medicine, law science,
engineering, public policy or a related field, will consider
applications in four categories: medical, food and nutrition,
clean technology and information technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winners will receive an &#8220;acceleration certificate&#8221; which
can move several different kinds of patent-office procedures to
the head of the line, including patent appeals and re-
examinations. The certificate can be used for one item in the
winner&#8217;s portfolio, regardless of whether it is related to the
humanitarian program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The submission period for applications runs from March 1
through Aug. 31. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lenovo, Computer Makers Settle Case Over Green Dam Software &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) and other computer makers settled a
lawsuit brought by a California software maker who had claimed
the Green Dam software installed on personal computers in China
infringes its copyright. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The parties have reached a settlement resolving the
entire case,&#8221; Cybersitter LLC, the software maker, said Feb. 7
in a filing in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana, California.
Terms of the settlement weren&#8217;t disclosed in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closely held Cybersitter sued China, seven computer makers
and two Chinese software makers in 2010, seeking $2.2 billion in
damages over allegations the Green Dam program illegally copies
more than 3,000 lines of code from Cybersitter&#8217;s Internet
content-filtering program. The Chinese government made Green Dam
mandatory on personal computers sold there in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers in China have reported that Green Dam contains
more than 6,500 political keyword filters, including words
related to China&#8217;s control of Tibet, the 1989 Tiananmen Square
massacre and the government-banned Falun Gong religious group,
Cybersitter said in its complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Michigan said in a 2009
report that Green Dam could impair computer performance by
making machines more prone to security breaches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A report that same year from the OpenNet Initiative, which
includes researchers at the University of Cambridge, University
of Oxford and University of Toronto, called Green Dam, a
&#8220;substandard product&#8221; developed by companies with little
experience in such software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Schwartz, a lawyer for Lenovo in Los Angeles, and
Elliot Gipson, a lawyer for Santa Barbara, California-based
Cybersitter, didn&#8217;t immediately return calls seeking comment on
the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gipson said in a telephone interview last month that China
hadn&#8217;t responded to the complaint and that U.S. District Judge
Josephine Staton Tucker last year granted a motion for entry of
default against the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Cybersitter v. the People&#8217;s Republic of China,
U.S. District Court, Central District of California (Santa Ana). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pornography Not Copyrightable, Infringement Defendant Argues &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A resident of California&#8217;s Solano County has presented a
novel defense to allegations of copyright infringement made by
lawyers for an adult film company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liuxia Wong, who filed a complaint seeking a court
declaration she hasn&#8217;t infringed a copyright belonging to Hard
Drive Productions Inc., says the work in question isn&#8217;t entitled
to copyright protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her complaint filed Jan. 30 in federal court in San
Francisco, she argues that the U.S. Constitution&#8217;s Copyright
Clause protects only works &#8220;which promote the progress of
science and the useful arts.&#8221; The film she is accused of
infringing -- &#8220;Amateur Allure Jen&#8221; -- fails to meet the
constitutional requirements for protection, she said in her
pleadings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film depicts &#8220;obscene material,&#8221; &#8220;does not promote
the useful arts&#8221; and &#8220;does not promote the progress of
science,&#8221; Wong claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also argued that Hard Drive demanded $3,400 from her so
she could avoid being named a defendant in an infringement
action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Included in her case filing is a demand letter from Steele
Hansmeier LLC, a Chicago law firm. The letter tells her that she
can &#8220;work out a settlement with us&#8221; and avoid &#8220;the costs of
attorney fees and the uncertainty associated with jury
verdicts&#8221; by mailing the firm a check for $3,400. The firm said
if she settled she would remain anonymous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wong called the firm&#8217;s actions intimidation, claiming she
didn&#8217;t download the movie or authorize anyone else using her
computer to download it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She asked the court to declare she wasn&#8217;t liable for
infringement and that the film wasn&#8217;t copyrightable.
Additionally, she sought an order barring Hard Drive from
demanding settlements &#8220;not supported by facts and law&#8221; and for
awards of litigation costs and attorney fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wong is represented by Aaron K. McClellan and Steven W.
Yuen of Murphy Pearson Bradley  Feeney of San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Liuxia Wong v. Hard Drive Productions Inc.,
5:12-00469-HRL, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ericsson Sued by Airvana in New York for $330 Million &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ericsson AB, the world&#8217;s largest maker of wireless
networks, was sued for more than $330 million by Airvana Network
Solutions Inc., which says Ericsson misappropriated intellectual
property. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ericsson secretly developed a product based on Airvana
trade secrets to operate wireless network equipment in order to
avoid paying software licensing fees, Airvana said in a
complaint filed yesterday in New York state court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ericsson has now undertaken a blatant ploy to evade its
contractual obligations, by developing a secret &#8216;in-house&#8217;
project designed to misappropriate critical Airvana intellectual
property,&#8221; the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ericsson, which depended on Airvana&#8217;s technology to service
customers, &#8220;constantly badgered&#8221; Airvana to reduce the price
of the software and began development of its own product in
2010, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airvana, based in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, said it has
suffered damages of more than $330 million and will face &#8220;an
immediate and precipitous decline&#8221; in revenue if Ericsson is
able to displace the company with its own product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Stockholm&#8217;s Ericsson couldn&#8217;t be reached
for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Airvana Network Solutions Inc. v. Ericsson
Inc., 650360-2012, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ex-Motorola Worker Guilty of Trade Secret Theft, Judge Rules &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hanjuan Jin, a former Motorola Inc. (MMI) software engineer
charged with stealing trade secrets from the company, was found
guilty and acquitted of economic espionage to benefit a foreign
government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jin was tried in Chicago before U.S. District Judge Ruben Castillo in November after being indicted on three counts of
stealing trade secrets and three more counts of economic
espionage. She waived her right to a jury. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday Castillo found her guilty of stealing trade
secrets and acquitted her on the three counts of economic
espionage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I conclude that Ms. Jin criminally betrayed Motorola by
stealing its trade secrets,&#8221; the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Castillo allowed Jin to remain in home confinement and
scheduled sentencing for April 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jin, 41, faces as long as 10 years in prison on the trade
secrets conviction. She faced as long as 15 years in prison on
each of the economic espionage counts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was indicted in 2008, a year after she returned to
Schaumburg, Illinois-based Motorola following a yearlong medical
leave of absence and immediately stepped down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Customs agents stopped her as she was about to board a
plane at Chicago&#8217;s O&#8217;Hare International Airport on Feb. 28,
2007. In her possession were more than 1,000 Motorola documents,
$30,000 in cash and a one-way ticket to China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was accused of simultaneously working for Motorola and
for a Beijing-based company, Kai Sun News (Beijing) Technology
Co., also known as SunKaisens, which was affiliated with China&#8217;s
military. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Jin, 08-cr-192, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of Illinois (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;EKA-AZS Challenges Trademark Infringement Award to Rosneft &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EKA-AZS, the operator of a chain of gas stations in the
Moscow region, is challenging the award the Moscow Commercial
Court made to Rosneft Oil Co. (ROSN) in a trademark-infringement suit,
the Russian Legal Information Agency said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2005 the two companies entered into a franchise
agreement for EKA-AZS to use the trademark on 40 gasoline
filling stations for five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit involved the use of the Rosneft trademark for five
months after a contract between the two companies for the use of
the mark expired in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December the court reduced the judgment against EKA-AZS
from 5 million rubles ($168,000) to 3 million. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian Kuritzky ran the 1,576 steps up
New York&#8217;s tallest building in the time it usually takes him to
grab lunch at the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) cafeteria. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuritzky, a 25-year-old security analyst, raised $100,000
for the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation by completing the
1,050-foot stair climb at the 35th Annual Empire State Building
Run-Up in 12 minutes, 52 seconds last night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In these 12 minutes I ran up 86 flights of stairs,&#8221;
Kuritzky said in an interview from the Empire State Building&#8217;s
observation deck. &#8220;That&#8217;s a bit more productive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event, which began with 15 competitors in 1977,
featured runners from 20 to 78 years of age from 25 countries
including Australia, Japan, Mexico and Turkey. The race expects
to raise more than $475,000 for MMRF. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Dold of Germany won the men&#8217;s invitational, his
record seventh consecutive title, with a time of 10:28. Melissa
Moon of New Zealand (12:39) triumphed in the women&#8217;s division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuritzky&#8217;s friends, family and co-workers pledged $10,000
for each of the 10 runners he beat in the men&#8217;s invitational
heat. He finished 14th, raising $100,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There was an unbelievable amount of support for me once
they heard it was a charitable event,&#8221; Kuritzky said. &#8220;It&#8217;s
very humbling.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Charity Runs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuritzky, whose mother died of breast cancer when he was
15, has run the New York City marathon and a 140.6-mile (226
kilometer) iron-distance triathlon to raise funds for cancer
research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event was invitation only before last year, when MMRF
first became the benefiting charity. This year featured a wave
of about 100 charity runners, each of whom raised a minimum of
$2,500 for MMRF. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As snow fell outside, runners spread the workload between
their arms and legs by pulling themselves up along the handrail.
Moon, who won the event in 2010, said the snowy nighttime finish
was a &#8220;dream come true.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s so special to be able to finish the race at the
Empire State Building at night,&#8221; the 42-year-old New Zealander
said in an interview. &#8220;It all unfolded just the way I
visualized it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Backward Running &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dold also holds a world record in the 10-kilometer backward
run, according to his website. He said this was one of the
toughest races he&#8217;s had at the Empire State Building. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The biggest thing for me is not to look at the others,&#8221;
Dold, 27, said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not able to go 100 percent the whole time,
so pacing myself is the strategy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 10-team corporate division race was won by Joe Walsh,
Greg Maurer-Hollaender and Russell Kempf of CBRE Group Inc. (CBG), the
world&#8217;s biggest commercial real-estate services firm, with a
combined time of 46:01. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course record of 9:33 was set by Paul Crake in 2003,
according to the New York Road Runners, which also organizes the
New York City Marathon. The woman&#8217;s record of 11:23 was set in
2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrissie Wellington, a four-time Ironman World Champion,
finished third in the women&#8217;s race at 13:15. The 34-year-old
from the U.K. said she didn&#8217;t decide to run until noon
yesterday, while she was in town promoting a memoir about her
athletic career. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Mind Over Matter&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wellington, who wants to enter more stair climb events,
said the Run-Up was more painful than a triathlon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Whether you&#8217;re doing a triathlon or you&#8217;re doing this,
it&#8217;s all mind over matter,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Your body hurts and you
want to give up, and it&#8217;s just having the mental strength to
resist those urges.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuritzky said he had to push himself to continue after
reaching the halfway point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I hit the 43rd floor and thought, &#8216;Okay I made it
halfway,&#8217; and my body said, &#8216;Well that&#8217;s about all I can do,&#8217;&#8221;
he said. &#8220;You have this vision of it being a lot easier and
when you&#8217;re running it&#8217;s so much more challenging.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former Cornell University soccer player, Kuritzky said he
trained mostly by running and playing sports. He said it was
hard to train on stairs because there&#8217;s no structure even close
to tall enough to simulate the challenge of the Empire State
Building. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was at work yesterday and said he&#8217;d be up at 6 a.m. to
return to work on time this morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The legs won&#8217;t be happy with me, but I will sleep very
well tonight,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, will face claims in court that it
had conflicting interests when it advised El Paso Corp. in its
$21.1 billion buyout by oil-pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMI) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delaware Chancery Court Judge Leo Strine will hear
arguments in Wilmington today from El Paso shareholders that
Kinder Morgan&#8217;s $25.91-a-share bid for the pipeline company
should be put on hold so other potential offers can be pursued.
The original offer was tainted by Goldman Sachs&#8217;s conflicting
roles in the deal, lawyers for pension funds and other investors
said in court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This case presents a rare combination of deliberate
indifference to an adviser&#8217;s flagrant conflicts with the soft
but powerful harm from undisclosed management conflicts,&#8221;
lawyers for the investors said in a Feb. 3 filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s business practices have been criticized
over the past two years after the New York-based company agreed
to pay $550 million to resolve government claims that marketing
materials about investments linked to subprime mortgages had
&#8220;incomplete information.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the largest penalty ever levied by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission against a Wall Street firm.
Goldman Sachs also faced questions from politicians and labor
unions about its compensation system after getting taxpayer aid
during the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given all the bad press Goldman has gotten recently, it
might have been better if they&#8217;d taken a pass on serving as an
adviser in this deal,&#8221; said Charles Elson, a finance professor
at the University of Delaware who runs the school&#8217;s Weinberg
Center for Corporate Governance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Reasonable Measures&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Goldman Sachs and El Paso countered in their
court filings that the investment bank took &#8220;reasonable
measures&#8221; to deal with potential conflicts and Goldman&#8217;s
advisers didn&#8217;t compromise El Paso directors&#8217; consideration of
the buyout proposal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for a Louisiana pension fund contend Goldman Sachs
has long-standing ties to Kinder Morgan, helping Richard Kinder,
the firm&#8217;s chief executive officer, take the Houston-based
pipeline operator private in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs wound up with a 19 percent stake in Kinder
Morgan and has its designees in two of the company&#8217;s board
seats, the fund&#8217;s lawyers say. The investment bank then reaped
millions of dollars by leading Kinder Morgan&#8217;s initial public
offering in 2011, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Didn&#8217;t Provide Enough &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs also had advised El Paso over the years, the
investors&#8217; lawyers said. When Kinder approached the rival
pipeline company about a buyout last year, El Paso executives
called in Goldman Sachs as an adviser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Paso&#8217;s board ultimately agreed to Kinder&#8217;s $25.91-a-
share bid, which includes both cash and stock, and provides a 37
premium to shareholders, officials for the company said last
year. Investors contend the offer didn&#8217;t provide enough for
their El Paso shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman&#8217;s staggering conflict of interest was obvious
from the outset: With a stake in KMI worth over $4 billion,
every dollar shaved off the buyout price presented approximately
$150 million of savings for Goldman,&#8221; the investors&#8217; lawyers
said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors&#8217; lawyers contend Goldman Sachs officials
convinced El Paso directors that Kinder Morgan&#8217;s bid was the
best option and downplayed advantages of continuing independent
operations or spinning off parts of the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Eyes Wide Open&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their court filings, Goldman Sachs officials counter the
bank took steps to deal with any potential conflict, including
having Goldman directors on Kinder Morgan&#8217;s board recuse
themselves from considering the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank also made sure El Paso officials were aware of
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s stake in Kinder Morgan and that they brought the
firm&#8217;s advisers in &#8220;with their eyes wide open,&#8221; lawyers for
Goldman Sachs said in their Jan. 26 filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Paso also had Goldman Sachs&#8217;s advice double-checked by
executives of Morgan Stanley  Co., which served as a second
adviser in the deal, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s lawyers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, El Paso&#8217;s decision to bring Goldman Sachs in as an
adviser drew the ire of Morgan Stanley executives, court filings
show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Munger, a Morgan Stanley banker, said in an e-mail
that Goldman Sachs had an &#8220;enormous conflict&#8221; in the case and
that the investment bank&#8217;s decision to serve as one of El Paso&#8217;s
advisers was &#8220;GS at its most shameless,&#8221; investors&#8217; lawyers
said in their filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Both Sides &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s attorneys said that investors&#8217; lawyers
portrayed the bank as a wrongdoer simply because it had
relationships with both sides of a buyout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Every piece of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s advice is painted in the
most dastardly terms, allegedly motivated by rapacious and crude
objectives,&#8221; the firm&#8217;s lawyers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strine will have to decide whether the efforts of Goldman
Sachs and El Paso to ensure potential conflicts didn&#8217;t taint
consideration of Kinder Morgan&#8217;s offer inoculated the firms from
liability, said Larry Hamermesh, a professor at Widener
University (78130MF)&#8217;s law school in Wilmington who specializes in
corporate law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Del Monte Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If a board is fully aware an adviser has a conflict, and
decides to look past that and hire them anyway, I don&#8217;t see much
problem with that,&#8221; Hamermesh said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Paso investors are hoping Strine will take note of a
colleague&#8217;s recent finding that Barclays Plc (BARC) executives had a
conflict when they served as a financial adviser to Del Monte
Foods Co. (DLM) in a buyout by private-equity firms led by KKR  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chancery Judge Travis Laster found Barclays officials had a
conflict because they provided some of the financing to the
private-equity firms buying the maker of Meow Mix cat food and
Milk Bone dog biscuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge put the deal on hold until the company could make
more disclosures about Barclay&#8217;s role in the acquisition. Del
Monte and Barclays later agreed to pay $89.4 million to settle
investor suits over the buyout that cited the conflict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think this Goldman case is being driven by the idea
that these conflict cases in Chancery are hot right now,&#8221;
Hamermesh said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re El Paso Corp. (EP) Shareholder Litigation,
Consolidated 6949-CS, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lucas van Praag&#8217;s departure after 12
years as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s chief spokesman and the
possible hiring of a former U.S. Treasury Department aide to
replace him signal that Wall Street is ready to change its tone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van Praag, whose retirement was announced in an internal
memo yesterday, had a taste for dismissing negative press
reports about New York-based Goldman Sachs as &#8220;chimera produced
by a febrile mind&#8221; and &#8220;effluent.&#8221; The 62-year-old British
citizen&#8217;s style was described in a New York Observer profile as
&#8220;basically a stiffly extended middle finger.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That may have suited the pre-2008 era, when Goldman Sachs
was still the most profitable securities firm in Wall Street
history and its employees the most richly rewarded. After an
economic collapse, taxpayer bailout, anti-Wall Street protests
and declining profits and pay, the entire industry has to find a
new approach, said Mark Arena, a former spokesman for Zurich-
based UBS AG (UBSN) who rates public relations efforts on
prverdict.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s far bigger than Goldman Sachs, it&#8217;s really a whole
shift in the way the industry is viewed,&#8221; Arena said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;The perception that they&#8217;re the smartest
people in the room has faded.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arena, who worked at UBS, Switzerland&#8217;s largest bank, for
14 years and ran communications in the Americas before leaving
18 months ago, said Wall Street had become accustomed to being a
&#8220;glamour industry&#8221; thanks to its high pay and complexity.
Bankers and traders have been slow to recognize that the press
and public are no longer willing to accept Wall Street&#8217;s views
without question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Listening Mode &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A PR strategy that basically says, &#8216;If you don&#8217;t
understand it you&#8217;re an idiot,&#8217; that only works when markets are
going very high,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But when suddenly the industry was
having to be bailed out and there are all sorts of regulatory
problems, then the mood needs to change and you need to be much
more in listening mode, conciliatory mode, explanatory mode.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, led since mid-2006 by Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 57, has had an especially
hard time adapting. As a private partnership until 1999, the
firm&#8217;s employees were warned to avoid media attention. By 2007,
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s industry-leading profits -- and Blankfein&#8217;s
record-setting $67.9 million bonus -- gave the firm an aura of
invincibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was stripped away in 2008 when the firm converted to a
bank one week after smaller rival Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc.&#8217;s bankruptcy and accepted a $10 billion rescue from the
Treasury Department -- led at the time by Henry Paulson,
Blankfein&#8217;s predecessor at Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;God&#8217;s Work&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rolling Stone writer Matt Taibbi dubbed the firm &#8220;a great
vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity&#8221; in a 2009
article. An interview Blankfein granted to London&#8217;s Sunday Times
that year backfired when the paper splashed his sarcastic quip
that the firm&#8217;s employees were doing &#8220;God&#8217;s work.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s image hit a low in April 2010 when the
Securities and Exchange Commission sued the firm for fraud,
alleging it misled investors about a mortgage-linked investment
sold in 2007. The company paid $550 million in July 2010 to
settle the charges, admitting only to making a &#8220;mistake&#8221; in
marketing materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Wall Street never had a lot of really bad press after
World War II until the present period,&#8221; said Charles Geisst, a
finance professor at Manhattan College in Riverdale, New York,
who has written about the history of Wall Street. Now Goldman
Sachs is &#8220;the most maligned financial institution in this
country and probably will remain so for a very long time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Considering Siewert &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is considering replacing van Praag by hiring
Richard L. &#8220;Jake&#8221; Siewert Jr., a 48-year-old former aide to
Democrats including Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and
former President Bill Clinton, people familiar with the matter
said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siewert, who hasn&#8217;t been hired yet, has the career of a
Washington policy technocrat compared with the drama of van
Praag&#8217;s. The Goldman Sachs spokesman joined the British Navy
after being kicked out of boarding school, worked on an oil rig
and spent a decade at Bankers Trust where he arranged ship
finance, sold currency swaps and used his French and Dutch
language skills during a stint in Brussels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siewert is a graduate of Yale University and the University
of California at Berkeley&#8217;s law school. He started his
Washington career as communications director for the Democratic
Governors Association before working for Gene Sperling at the
National Economic Council during the Clinton administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;President&#8217;s Press Secretary &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He worked his way up in Clinton&#8217;s communications
department, eventually succeeding Joe Lockhart as the main press
secretary in the last few months of the presidency. At age 37 he
joined Pittsburgh-based Alcoa Inc., the largest aluminum
company, and managed corporate development and public strategy
before joining Geithner at Treasury in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Wells, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York,
declined to comment. Van Praag didn&#8217;t immediately reply to an
e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Cohan, a Bloomberg View columnist who interviewed
Siewert last year, said he seemed &#8220;very open and honest and
frank.&#8221; Cohan, whose book &#8220;Money and Power: How Goldman Sachs
Came to Rule the World&#8221; was published last year, said Siewert
seems &#8220;more like a regular guy&#8221; than van Praag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I do sense a little that because of Lucas&#8217;s demeanor, the
way he was brought up, that he might have seemed arrogant and
condescending,&#8221; said Cohan, who said he himself found van Praag
&#8220;warm and charming.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He doubts that the public perception of Goldman Sachs will
change as long as Blankfein is running the firm and economic
distress and regulatory change limits revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Paradigm Shift &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They think that they&#8217;re just a few innings away from the
status quo being restored but actually is there something else
going on, is there a real paradigm shift going on?&#8221; Cohan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as Goldman Sachs was distributing a memo to employees
yesterday about van Praag&#8217;s retirement at the end of March,
Chief Financial Officer David A. Viniar was telling investors at
a conference in Miami that the company&#8217;s declining profit was a
temporary setback similar to the 2001 downturn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the question-and-answer session, one man -- who
described himself as a Goldman Sachs competitor and observer for
more than 40 years -- asked Viniar what Wall Street can do
differently to get its &#8220;collective voice&#8221; heard again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acknowledging that &#8220;it&#8217;s a hard question,&#8221; Viniar said
that time has to pass and the economy has to improve. In its
contacts with regulators about new rules, Goldman Sachs is
trying to emphasize what will help markets and the economy and
to talk less about what will be good for the industry, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Good for Business &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We need to convince people that&#8217;s really what we care
about, and obviously, those things will be good for our
business,&#8221; said Viniar, 56. &#8220;We have to make sure that those
things are more aligned than many had thought they were aligned
in the past.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To succeed, Wall Street has to find a new voice in an era
where &#8220;people are less interested in what they have to say and
question their motives all the time,&#8221; said Arena, the former
UBS spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even if the message from the firm doesn&#8217;t change,
sometimes all that&#8217;s needed is a shift in tone,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A
tone that seems appeasing rather than instructive, that&#8217;s more
conciliatory rather than didactic.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cobalt International Energy Inc. (CIE), a
deep-water oil explorer whose biggest investors include Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS), climbed to a record after test results at a
discovery off the coast of Angola exceeded the company&#8217;s
expectations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cobalt surged 33 percent to $31.68 in New York, its highest
close since the company first sold shares to the public in 
December 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work at the Cameia-1 well confirmed a 1,180-foot (360-
meter) oil column, the company said in a statement. Cobalt and
its partners will now begin to appraise the well to evaluate the
discovery&#8217;s size, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The results have exceeded our pre-drill expectations and
have increased our confidence in our entire West Africa pre-salt
exploration inventory,&#8221; Joseph Bryant, chairman and chief
executive officer of Houston-based Cobalt, said in the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cobalt said on Jan. 10 its Cameia-1 well in the Kwanza
basin found a &#8220;high-quality&#8221; oil reservoir. BP Plc (BP/),
ConocoPhillips (COP) and Total SA are among oil producers that won
licenses in Angola&#8217;s pre-salt areas largely running from the
equator south to the Tropic of Capricorn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy companies are exploring possible oil reservoirs
below a layer of salt more than two miles beneath the seabed off
Africa&#8217;s coast. That follows success off Brazil on the South
American side of the Atlantic in finding some of the largest
fields of the last decade under the same mineral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Drilling Plan &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cameia well may have the potential to produce more than
20,000 barrels of oil a day, according to Cobalt, which has
wells in the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa. The company said it
plans to start drilling at the Cameia-2 well this month, work
that&#8217;s expected to take 100 to 120 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This basically confirms pre-salt hydrocarbons within this
trend and opens up opportunity on the other multiple prospects
that Cobalt holds in the area, including Gabon,&#8221; Scott Hanold,
an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in Minneapolis, said in a
telephone interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cameia prospect area may have close to 2.5 billion
barrels gross, based on preliminary results, said Hanold, who
has a &#8220;sector perform&#8221; rating on Cobalt shares and doesn&#8217;t own
any. The 50 percent stock price climb by the company earlier
today implied a possible 10 billion barrels gross in areas
offshore West Africa where Cobalt has properties, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re talking about something that could rival all the
stuff that&#8217;s happening in Brazil,&#8221; Hanold said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be several years before production is under way off
Angola, Cobalt said on a conference call today. Cobalt has a 40
percent stake in Cameia-1 and the block where it was drilled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and private-equity firm Riverstone Holdings
LLC each hold 19 percent stakes in Cobalt, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greece, facing doubts from European
officials about its commitment to reduce deficits, will take
years to emerge from its debt crisis, JPMorgan Chase
International Chairman Jacob Frenkel said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What we&#8217;re talking now about is not a magic wand that in
one day will change the face of the country,&#8221; Frenkel, a former
governor of the Bank of Israel, said today in a radio interview
on &#8220;Bloomberg Surveillance&#8221; with Tom Keene and Ken Prewitt.
&#8220;Those expectations will be frustrated unless it is
communicated very clearly that problems that arose over years
need to be corrected over years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emergency talks of euro-area finance chiefs on a second
bailout of Greece broke up late yesterday, with Luxembourg Prime
Minister Jean-Claude Juncker saying the nation must turn its
budget cuts into law to win a 130 billion-euro ($172 billion)
rescue package. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told
lawmakers in Berlin that Greece was missing deficit targets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People say past record has shown that promises have not
always been delivered,&#8221; said Frenkel, who&#8217;s based in New York
at the JPMorgan Chase  Co. unit. &#8220;If you have a binding
commitment that is coupled with international and Europe
community assistance, then this can give some breathing space.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Athens, unions struck for the second time this week and
police used tear gas to counter protesters. George Karatzaferis,
head of one of the three parties backing interim Prime Minister
Lucas Papademos, said he wouldn&#8217;t support austerity measures
worked out for a rescue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Won&#8217;t Solve Problem &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Let&#8217;s face it, it will not solve the problem for the long
term,&#8221; Frenkel said of the aid package. &#8220;Growth is not
purchased by money or by debt. Growth is acquired through
economic policy, improved markets and increased flexibility of
the marketplace.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany&#8217;s Schaeuble said that current plans would leave
Greece&#8217;s debt as high as 136 percent of gross domestic product
by 2020, according to two people in the meeting who spoke on
condition of anonymity because it was private. That compares
with the 120 percent foreseen in the bailout being negotiated.
Debt was about 160 percent of GDP last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A debt load that&#8217;s 120 percent of GDP can be an
&#8220;encouraging number if it is a longer trajectory of a smaller
number over time,&#8221; Frenkel said. &#8220;If the future means economic
policies with greater tilt toward sustainable growth, and the
word sustainable is key, then there is a chance. Otherwise, we
are throwing good money after bad.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) and three other U.S. banks reached a $25 billion
settlement with 49 states and the U.S. government to end a probe
of abusive foreclosure practices stemming from the collapse of
the housing bubble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department, Department of Housing and
Urban Development and state attorneys general yesterday
announced the agreement, which was more than 16 months in the
making following a move by states to investigate bank
foreclosure practices in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nation&#8217;s five largest mortgage servicers -- Bank of
America, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), Citigroup Inc. (C) and Ally
Financial Inc. (ALLY) -- entered into the settlement. With 49 state
attorneys general on board, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder
called the agreement the largest federal-state civil settlement
in U.S. history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oklahoma entered into a separate agreement worth $18.6
million with the banks and didn&#8217;t sign the federal settlement,
according to a statement from the state&#8217;s attorney general,
Scott Pruitt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $25 billion agreement includes a $1.5 billion payment
to some 750,000 borrowers who lost their homes to foreclosure.
About $17 billion will pay for mortgage debt forgiveness,
forbearance, short sales and other assistance to homeowners.
Servicers will also provide $3 billion in refinancings to lower
homeowners&#8217; interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America has committed as much as $11.8 billion,
including a cash payment of $3.24 billion, according to a
government fact sheet. The balance will be applied toward
mortgage modifications, principal reductions and other benefits
for borrowers. Ally has committed as much as $310 million;
Citigroup $2.2 billion; JPMorgan $5.29 billion and Wells Fargo
$5.35 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This settlement will help provide additional support for
homeowners who need assistance, brings more certainty to the
housing market and aligns to our ongoing commitment to help
rebuild our neighborhoods and get the housing market back on
track,&#8221; Dan Frahm, a Bank of America spokesman, said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement doesn&#8217;t release any criminal liability or
grant any immunity, release any private claims by individuals or
any class-action claims, or release claims related to the
packaging of mortgage loans into securities, according to the
website outlining the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resolution also establishes a monitor, Joseph A. Smith
Jr., North Carolina&#8217;s top banking regulator, to track compliance
with the terms of the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New Suits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ex-Takeda Executive Committed Insider Trading, SEC Claims &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former Takeda Pharmaceutical International Inc. (4502) executive
was accused of using inside information to make more than
$63,000 trading in call options, according a lawsuit filed by
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent Bankosky, a former director in Takeda&#8217;s business
development group, used non-public information to trade in
advance of Takeda&#8217;s announcement of transactions involving Cell
Genesys Inc. and Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc., the SEC said
in a civil complaint filed yesterday in Manhattan federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bankosky also used information about confidential
discussions between Takeda and two other drug companies, Arena
Pharmaceutical Inc. and AMAG Pharmaceutical Inc., according to
the agency. Bankosky failed to profit from his trades in those
companies&#8217; securities, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elissa Johnsen, a spokeswoman for Osaka, Japan-based Takeda
Pharmaceutical Co.&#8217;s North American unit, didn&#8217;t immediately
return a voice-mail message seeking comment on the SEC suit.
Bankosky&#8217;s lawyer, Robert Heim, also didn&#8217;t immediately return a
voice mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Bankosky, 12-CV-1012, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lehman Sues Citigroup for $2.5 Billion &#8216;Wrongfully&#8217; Taken &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. sued Citigroup
Inc.&#8217;s Citibank for $2.5 billion claiming the bank
&#8220;wrongfully&#8221; withheld the money after it was transferred by
Lehman in the months before its 2008 bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman also is seeking &#8220;hundreds of millions&#8221; owed by
Citibank, and wants to reduce or deny $2 billion of claims
Citibank filed against Lehman, according to a court filing Feb.
8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman, which is pursuing a liquidation plan that would pay
creditors less than 18 cents on the dollar, has said that $2
billion of the cash it has gathered so far to pay creditors was
pledged to Citigroup. In addition to trying to free up cash, it
is seeking to cut bank claims on its assets to increase the
amount available for other creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This action is an unjustified attempt by the Lehman
estates to renege on their obligations to Citi, and claw back
assets to which they have no right,&#8221; said Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a spokeswoman for New York-based Citigroup. The bank,
which &#8220;went out of its way to try to help Lehman prior to its
bankruptcy filing,&#8221; will fight the lawsuit, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Lehman, Citibank has said it&#8217;s entitled to $2
billion of the defunct firm&#8217;s cash to secure its claims on
Lehman, which would otherwise be unsecured. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called setoff &#8220;is in violation of the bankruptcy
code,&#8221; Lehman said in the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romero-Apsilos said the bank took the cash to protect
itself and its shareholders from loss. Lehman filed the biggest
U.S. bankruptcy in history with debt of $613 billion more than
three years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Lehman v. Citibank, 12-01044, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Intel Antitrust Suit Dropped by N.Y. Attorney General &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York state has ended its more than two-year-old
antitrust suit against Intel Corp. (INTC) without fining the chipmaker
or imposing any restrictions on its conduct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel hasn&#8217;t admitted any wrongdoing or agreed to any
limitations on its business practices, said Sumner Lemon, a
spokesman for the Santa Clara, California-based company. Intel,
the world&#8217;s largest chipmaker, will pay $6.5 million to cover
the cost of some of the litigation, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While certain other matters are on appeal, this
settlement brings to an end what was the last active court-level
antitrust litigation involving Intel&#8217;s sales conduct,&#8221; Lemon
said. It &#8220;puts an end to any associated expense and distraction
from such matters.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York sued Intel in November 2009, accusing it of using
threats and illegal payments to pressure computer manufacturers
to use its chips. Leonard Stark, a U.S. district judge in
Delaware who is presiding over the case, canceled the Feb. 14
trial to allow lawyers from both sides to discuss whether the
case should be dismissed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While we were disappointed by the rulings of the Delaware
federal judge handling the matter, it&#8217;s important to note that
our claims were dismissed on procedural, not substantive
grounds,&#8221; Jennifer Givner, a spokeswoman for New York Attorney
General Eric Schneiderman, said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We
continue to believe that those claims, which were asserted under
the previous administration, had merit, but in light of the
court&#8217;s decision believe that no purpose is served by pursuing
the matter further.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is State of New York v. Intel Corp., 09-cv-827,
U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SEC Said to Review Settlement With Ex-Bear Stearns Managers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is considering
a proposed settlement with two former Bear Stearns Cos.
portfolio managers to resolve a case that has been pursued by
federal securities regulators for more than three years, three
people familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ralph Cioffi and Matthew Tannin, who managed the Wall
Street firm&#8217;s two largest hedge funds, are scheduled to stand
trial on Feb. 13 over SEC civil claims that they deceived their
own investors about their funds&#8217; subprime mortgage exposure,
causing losses of about $1.6 billion when the funds collapsed in
July 2007. SEC commissioners were scheduled to vote on a
proposed agreement in a closed meeting yesterday, the people
said without providing details of the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cioffi and Tannin gained attention in November 2009 when a
federal court jury found them not guilty in a related criminal
trial, the first stemming from a U.S. probe of the collapse of
the subprime-mortgage market. Cioffi, 56, was senior portfolio
manager for the funds and Tannin, 50, was chief operating
officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hedge funds filed for bankruptcy in July 2007 after
collateralized debt obligations linked to risky home loans began
to sour. Bear Stearns collapsed less than a year later and was
purchased by New York-based JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two men misrepresented the funds&#8217; deteriorating
condition and the level of investor redemption requests as they
sought to bring in new money and keep existing investors from
withdrawing funds, the SEC said in its complaint. They also
exaggerated their own investments in the funds while using their
personal stakes as a selling point, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cioffi and Tannin have contested the SEC&#8217;s claims for more
than three years in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, New York.
They argued in a December filing that, under a U.S. Supreme
Court ruling involving Janus Capital Group Inc. (JNS), they can&#8217;t be
held liable for alleged misstatements in monthly reports to
investors because they only assisted in preparing the documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed settlement being weighed by SEC commissioners
would still need to be approved by U.S. District Judge Frederic Block in Brooklyn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Nester, an SEC spokesman, declined to comment, as did
Nina Beattie, an attorney for Tannin at Brune  Richard LLP.
Phone calls to Edward Little and Marc Weinstein, lawyers for
Cioffi at Hughes Hubbard  Reed LLP, weren&#8217;t immediately
returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wynn Resorts Hearing Over Financial Records Access Continued &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN)&#8217;s former Vice Chairman Kazuo Okada must
wait until Feb. 23 to find out whether he can access the casino
operator&#8217;s financial records, a Las Vegas judge ruled, saying
she needs more time to go over the document requests in detail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevada state court judge Elizabeth Gonzales said at the
conclusion of a hearing yesterday that she wants to look at
Okada&#8217;s requests to determine which ones are reasonable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The company has a right to determine each document
individually,&#8221; Gonzales said. A director&#8217;s right to review
company books is &#8220;limited under Nevada law,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okada, who was removed as vice chairman in October, sued in
state court in Clark County, Nevada, to force the company to
produce spending records. Okada, who is chairman of Universal
Entertainment Corp. (6425), Wynn&#8217;s largest shareholder, has $380
million invested in the casino operator dating back to 2000,
according to regulatory filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirk Lenhard, an attorney for Wynn, argued that Okada&#8217;s
request was premature as such actions should be brought before
the board of directors. The board should be allowed to review
the request at a meeting next month before the court rules,
Lenhard said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gidon Caine, an attorney for Okada, said the request was
about &#8220;good corporate governance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gonzales &#8220;did not grant Mr. Okada&#8217;s request for relief but
she did ask us to reconsider the request,&#8221; Robert Shapiro, a
lawyer for Wynn Resorts, said after the hearing. &#8220;We will go to
the board of directors and get back to Judge Gonzales in two
weeks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Okada v. Wynn Resorts Ltd., A-12-654522-B,
District Court, Clark County Nevada (Las Vegas) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.S. Drops Antitrust Lawsuit Against Deutsche Boerse, NYSE &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department said it dismissed an antitrust
lawsuit and proposed settlement agreement with Deutsche Boerse
AG (DB1) and NYSE Euronext because the two exchange owners have given
up on their proposed merger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit and settlement are &#8220;no longer necessary since
the parties have formally abandoned their plans to merge,&#8221; the
Justice Department said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext terminated their merger
agreement Feb. 2, a day after European antitrust regulators
blocked the transaction because it would have concentrated too
much derivatives trading in the hands of a single entity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department had cleared the transaction Dec. 22
on the condition that a Deutsche Boerse unit sell its 31.5
percent stake in another U.S. equity market, Direct Edge
Holdings LLC. The proposed settlement resolved the concerns
about competition the Justice Department outlined in a lawsuit
filed the same day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its peak, a combined New York-based NYSE Euronext and
Frankfurt-based Deutsche Boerse would have been valued at more
than $26 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apple Loses German Case Over Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy Tab 10.1N &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL), maker of the iPad and iPhone, for the second
time failed to win a ban on sales of Samsung Electronics (005930) Co.&#8217;s
Galaxy 10.1N from a German court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dusseldorf Regional Court rejected the bid for an
emergency ruling yesterday in a case where Apple invoked a
European design right. Apple last week lost a similar attempt
over a technology patent in a Munich court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Dusseldorf appeals court last week upheld Apple&#8217;s request
to ban sales of the Galaxy Tab 10.1, the predecessor model,
which the company had won in the same lower court that rejected
yesterday&#8217;s bid. Samsung began selling the Galaxy Tab 10.1N, a
revised version, in Germany last year to get around that ban.
Samsung lost two patent rulings against its rival in a Mannheim
court last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Galaxy Tab 10.1N now sufficiently differs from the
form Apple has registered as a design right,&#8221; the court said in
a statement. &#8220;Apple&#8217;s iPads and Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy Tab 10.1N now
are two competing products of equal value.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legal battle between Cupertino, California-based Apple
and its closest competitor in tablet computers is intensifying
as an increasing number of consumers use tablets and smartphones
to visit websites, play games and download music. More patent
rulings between the two are scheduled for the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung said the ruling affirms its position that the
Galaxy Tab 10.1N is distinctive and doesn&#8217;t infringe the rights
asserted by Apple. The Galaxy Tab 10.1N remains available to
consumers in Germany, Samsung said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple spokesman Alan Hely declined to comment on
yesterday&#8217;s ruling and referred to the company&#8217;s earlier
statement that Samsung is &#8220;blatantly&#8221; copying the iPhone and
iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s case is LG Dusseldorf, 14c O 292/11. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Google, Amazon.com Win Trial Over Interactive Web Patents &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) were among the companies
that won a jury trial that challenged the validity of patents of
a Texas business on ways to make the Internet more interactive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal jury in Tyler, Texas, said two patents owned by
Eolas Technologies Inc. of Tyler are invalid. Adobe Systems
Inc. (ADBE), CDW Corp., JCPenney Co., Staples Inc., Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) and
Google&#8217;s YouTube unit were also challenging the patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eolas and the University of California, which co-owns the
patents because they stem from work by Michael Doyle, the Eolas
founder and a former university researcher, claimed some basic
Internet features used their technology, including music clips,
search features, maps, advertisements and embedded applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than a dozen companies had been named in the 2009
lawsuit. Apple Inc., Citigroup Inc. EBay Inc. and Playboy
Enterprises Inc. were among companies that settled before trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case was to have been tried in phases before U.S.
District Judge Leonard Davis, with the first looking at the
validity of the two patents, and then subsequent trials on
infringement and damages by groups of companies. Yesterday&#8217;s
verdict eliminates the need for those later trials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re disappointed, but we respect the jury&#8217;s decision,&#8221;
said Douglas Cawley of McKool Smith in Dallas, a lawyer for
Eolas. &#8220;We will evaluate our options.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verdict &#8220;affirms our assertion that the claims are
without merit,&#8221; said Jim Prosser, a spokesman for Mountain
View, California-based Google. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Rio Tinto Loses Bid to Challenge Australian Labor Ruling &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rio Tinto Group lost a bid to keep using non-unionized
workers in Western Australia&#8217;s Pilbara region, a decision a
lawyer for the world&#8217;s third-biggest mining company said may
affect other companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The High Court of Australia today rejected the miner&#8217;s
request for a full hearing as it attempted to overturn last
year&#8217;s appeal court ruling that invalidated its agreements with
railway workers and could give unions more leverage to represent
other employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John West, Rio Tinto&#8217;s lawyer, said failure to overturn the
appeal court decision would affect about 3,000 workers who have
contracts with BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) and HWE Mining. &#8220;Their
agreements have evaporated,&#8221; West said. &#8220;All someone has to do
now is sue.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rio Tinto&#8217;s attempt to stem the influence of unions at its
mines is part of a bigger battle in Australia between labor,
pressing to entrench workers&#8217; bargaining rights, and business,
which claims current laws stifle productivity. The government,
which re-introduced worker safeguards in 2009, is reviewing
legislation, with a three-member panel scheduled to issue a
report by the end of May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Five years ago Australia was one of the cheapest places
in the world for us to do business; today it&#8217;s one of the most
expensive,&#8221; Rio Tinto&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer Tom Albanese
said on a conference call yesterday. He said he&#8217;s concerned
&#8220;about the declining levels of productivity&#8221; in Australia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The unions were pretty well shut out,&#8221; Brandon Ellem, an
associate professor at the University of Sydney and author of
&#8220;Hard Ground: Unions in the Pilbara,&#8221; said in a phone
interview before today&#8217;s decision. The earlier Federal Appeal
Court ruling, &#8220;will make it a lot easier,&#8221; for workers to
organize, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The High Court panel said Rio Tinto&#8217;s prospects of winning
a reversal of the appeal court decision were insufficient to
warrant a full hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;EPA Cross-State Air Rule Unlawful, Opponents Tell Court &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&#8217;s regulation on
interstate air pollution is &#8220;one of the most costly, burdensome
and arbitrary&#8221; rules ever issued under the Clean Air Act,
opponents told a federal appeals court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than three dozen challengers to the EPA&#8217;s Cross-State
Air Pollution Rule in filings yesterday urged the U.S. Appeals
Court in Washington to vacate the rule, which was put on hold by
the court in December while it considered the legality of the
regulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Southern Co. (SO), EME Homer City Generation LP, a unit of
Edison International (EIX), and Energy Future Holdings Corp. units in
Texas are among the power companies challenging the rule. The
state of Texas, the National Mining Association and the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers joined in
parallel cases, saying the rule puts an undue financial burden
on power producers and threatens electricity reliability by
forcing companies to shut some older plants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EPA rule, which applies to Texas and 26 eastern states,
imposes caps on sulfur dioxide, which can lead to acid rain and
soot harmful to humans and ecosystems, and nitrogen oxide, a
component of ground-level ozone and a main ingredient of smog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule, issued in July and revised in October, applies to
emissions that cross state lines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power companies, state officials and lawmakers said the EPA
provided too little time to comply, and argued in court that the
October revisions should invalidate the entire rule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arguments in the case are scheduled for April 13. The EPA
is scheduled to respond to the opponents&#8217; filings on March 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is EME Homer City Generation LP v. U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, 11-1302, U.S. Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stanford Bank&#8217;s Swiss Accounts $1 Billion Short, Regulator Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Antiguan banking regulator told the jury in R. Allen
Stanford&#8217;s criminal trial he was &#8220;shocked&#8221; to find $1 billion
missing from Swiss bank accounts belonging to Stanford&#8217;s
Antiguan bank, days before U.S. regulators seized the company on
suspicion of fraud in February 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Ashe, Antigua&#8217;s supervisor of international banks,
testified that records he received from Societe Generale SA (GLE) in
early 2009 listed $250 million in Stanford International Bank
Ltd.&#8217;s Swiss investment account as of mid-2008. Stanford bank
records Ashe examined in the same timeframe showed $1.25 billion
in the same account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I was shocked,&#8221; Ashe testified yesterday in federal
court in Houston. &#8220;It suggested the document shown to us when
we did the examination was altered, forged.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors claim Stanford masterminded a $7 billion
investment fraud through bogus certificates of deposit at his
Antigua-based Stanford International Bank. Stanford, 61, who
denies all wrongdoing in connection with the alleged scheme, has
been in custody as a flight risk since his indictment in June
2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Witnesses have testified that Stanford secretly borrowed
more than $2 billion to finance a lavish lifestyle and private
businesses ranging from Caribbean airlines and real estate to
cricket tournaments. Prosecutors have presented evidence
suggesting that Stanford bribed Leroy King, then Antigua&#8217;s top
banking regulator, to hide the fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashe testified he found no mention of Stanford&#8217;s sizeable
borrowings in Stanford International Bank&#8217;s investment portfolio
records. Under Antiguan banking laws, any significant loans to
bank insiders must be &#8220;fully secured by cash, and the cash
should be placed within the bank itself, not in another bank,&#8221;
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Stanford International Bank had revealed Stanford&#8217;s loan
was part of its investment portfolio, &#8220;that would&#8217;ve been the
end of the bank,&#8221; Ashe testified. &#8220;This loan would&#8217;ve been
illegal. It would&#8217;ve been reckless, irresponsible and downright
negligent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford&#8217;s attorneys have told jurors the financier was in
the process of consolidating more than 100 private companies and
investments onto the bank&#8217;s ledgers in late 2008. They said the
consolidation would have zeroed out Stanford&#8217;s loan balance and
repaid all depositors if the SEC had not stepped in and stopped
the process. They contend the court-appointed U.S. receiver has
destroyed much of the value of Stanford&#8217;s companies through
mismanagement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kinder Morgan&#8217;s El Paso Buyout Should Be Barred, Lawyer Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMP)&#8217;s proposed $21.1 billion buyout of rival
pipeline operator El Paso Corp. should be barred because it was
tainted by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s conflicting interests in
the deal, a lawyer for El Paso investors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which holds a 19 percent stake in Houston-based Kinder Morgan, improperly served as an adviser to El Paso
on the acquisition offer, said Mark Lebovitch, a lawyer for
pension funds from Louisiana, Florida and New York that sued
over the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If there was ever a conflict that can&#8217;t be neutralized,
this is it,&#8221; Lebovitch told Delaware Chancery Court Judge Leo
Strine yesterday at a hearing in Wilmington. &#8220;The word
&#8216;conflict&#8217; just doesn&#8217;t do it justice.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s business practices have been criticized
during the past two years after the New York-based company
agreed to pay $550 million to resolve government claims that
marketing materials about investments linked to subprime
mortgages had &#8220;incomplete information.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the largest penalty ever levied by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission against a Wall Street firm.
Goldman Sachs also faced questions from politicians and labor
unions about its compensation system after getting taxpayer aid
during the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Paso&#8217;s board ultimately agreed to Kinder&#8217;s bid, which
includes both cash and stock and provides a 37 percent premium
to shareholders, officials for the company said last year. El
Paso investors contend the offer was too low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lebovitch told the judge yesterday that Goldman&#8217;s dual
roles as investor and adviser in the El Paso deal tainted the
pipeline company&#8217;s consideration of Kinder Morgan&#8217;s offer &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re El Paso Corp. Shareholder Litigation,
Consolidated 6949-CS, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Court News &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Delaware&#8217;s Secret Courts are Unconstitutional, Lawyer Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delaware Chancery Court&#8217;s use of its five judges to preside
over secret arbitration proceedings is unconstitutional, a
lawyer for a state advocacy group said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arbitration used to settle disputes between companies
outside the public eye in the presence of judge amounts to a
trial, especially if that judge is deciding facts and applicable
law in a decision that&#8217;s binding, attorney David Finger told a
federal judge in Philadelphia yesterday. The public has a right
under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution to access
judicial proceedings, Finger said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The point is the right to observe the judges in action,&#8221;
Finger told U.S. District Judge Mary A. McLaughlin in a hearing
to decide whether the Delaware statute should stand. &#8220;Evidence
is being presented and the judge is making findings of fact and
rules of law.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument is at the heart of a complaint filed by the
Delaware Coalition for Open Government Inc. against the five
Chancery Court judges in October challenging the 2009 statute
governing the sealed proceedings. The Reporters Committee for
Freedom of the Press and five news organizations, including the
New York Times and the Associated Press, filed papers in support
of the Delaware Coalition. The Delaware State Bar Association,
the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq have backed the court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint was filed after Skyworks Solutions Inc. (SWKS), a
semiconductor maker, and Advanced Analogic Technologies Inc., a
chipmaker, revealed in September that both companies filed
arbitration petitions under the Delaware program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dueling petitions were the first public indication that
the statute had been put into use in the Chancery Court, which
has jurisdiction over the majority of Fortune 500 companies. At
least six companies have used the confidential process so far,
Finger said. Delaware Superior Court has a similar statute,
which hasn&#8217;t yet been used, Finger said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andre Bouchard, an attorney for the judges, argued that the
proceedings fall within the scope of traditional commercial
arbitrations that have long been confidential and are meant to
streamline litigation and bring business to the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you opened up public access to this, what would be the
good of it?&#8221; Bouchard said. &#8220;Confidentiality is a key benefit
of commercial arbitration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Delaware Coalition for Open Government Inc. v.
Strine, 11-01015, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware
(Wilmington.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. corn stockpiles in the 2011-12
marketing year will tighten further and price gains will outpace
increases in other commodities in six months, Goldman Sachs
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corn will rise 9 percent in six months, Goldman said in an
e-mailed report dated yesterday. U.S. inventories are expected
by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to fall to 20.3 million
metric tons, the lowest level in 16 years. Global stockpiles may
fall to the lowest since 2006-07, according to the USDA.
Soybeans may gain 6 percent to $12.90 a bushel on reduced South
American production, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect further tightening of the 2011-12 U.S. corn
balance, lower South American corn and soybean production and a
2012-13 U.S. soybean balance in deficit,&#8221; New York-based
analyst Damien Courvalin said. &#8220;Corn prices will remain high
relative to other crops in coming months in order to secure
sufficient acreage gains in the U.S. to help rebuild U.S.
inventories.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corn futures have declined 11 percent in the past year,
partly on speculation that demand would decline amid economic
crises in the U.S. and European Union. Soybeans declined 15
percent and wheat has plunged 26 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soybean acreage may suffer as farmers plant corn in the
U.S., Goldman said. Dry weather in Brazil and Argentina will
reduce production of both crops, improving export demand for
inventories from the U.S., according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the increased corn planting in the U.S., the
biggest exporter of the grain, prices may decline after the
harvest in August and September. Gains in soybean futures are
expected to outpace corn in the 12-month timeframe, Goldman said
in the report. Corn may drop to $5.25 a bushel in a year while
soybeans may rise to $12.90 a bushel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political constraints and concern
production gains at shale fields aren&#8217;t sustainable will hinder
the development of liquefied natural gas export plants in the
U.S., former Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) chief Lee Raymond said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is going to be a big debate in the U.S. as to
whether or not they&#8217;re going to permit the export of liquefied
natural gas,&#8221; Raymond said in an interview in Oslo yesterday.
&#8220;Even if you get past the politics, you have to test whether or
not the resource base is sufficient.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New techniques to access the natural gas trapped in shale
rocks, including the use of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal
drilling, have transformed the U.S. into the world&#8217;s largest gas
producer. Estimates suggest fields in Pennsylvania, Ohio and
Texas may contain as much as 862 trillion cubic feet of the
fuel, enough to supply the U.S. for over thirty years at current
consumption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politicians including Democrats Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon
and Representative Edward Markey of Massachusetts have said
exports may raise domestic gas prices. In allowing exports, the
U.S. may be &#8220;trading away the enormous economic advantage of
having large, low-cost domestic natural gas supply,&#8221; Wyden
said in an e-mailed statement on Jan. 6.             &#8220;It&#8217;s
going to be a little while before people are really confident
that there is going to be a sufficient amount of gas for 30
years to support the construction of an LNG plant,&#8221; said
Raymond, who stepped down in 2005. &#8220;I&#8217;m frankly not sure that
we have enough experience with shale gas to make the kind of
judgment you&#8217;d have to make.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Global Supply &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some gas-industry players are confident the U.S. will
become a major exporter. BG Group Plc (BG/) said yesterday that the
U.S. will be able to supply about 9 percent of global liquefied
natural-gas output by the end of the decade. The U.K.&#8217;s third-
largest gas producer said the U.S. will have the capacity to
export about 45 metric million tons of LNG a year from 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising production of natural gas has driven down prices and
is leading owners of import terminals to explore exports.
Cheniere Energy Inc. has proposed a liquefaction facility at its
Sabine Pass terminal, which would be the first new North
American export project since 1969. BG has a preliminary
agreement to take gas from Sabine Pass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of building an LNG (LNG) terminal runs to billions of
dollars. Cheniere&#8217;s Sabine Pass terminal will have a capacity of
9 million tons a year. Construction costs at projects underway
in Australia, have reached $4,000 a ton of capacity, according
to analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Huge Investments&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you build any LNG, from a producer&#8217;s point of view,
you can only do that from an economic point of view if you&#8217;re
assured that you have a long-term competitive supply because
these are huge investments,&#8221; Raymond said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the world&#8217;s largest energy company by market value,
is pursuing shale exploration in Argentina, Poland and the U.S.
The company said earlier this month that two exploratory wells
drilled in a Polish shale formation last year weren&#8217;t
commercially viable. The gas discovered failed to flow in
sufficient quantities Texas-based Exxon said Feb. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s lots of shale around the world, but just because
it has the name shale on it doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s something that
would be economic to try to develop by the technique being used
largely in the U.S.,&#8221; Raymond said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production of shale gas in China would be a &#8220;real game
changer,&#8221; the former executive added. &#8220;China is run by
engineers, it&#8217;s not run by politicians.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re technically competent and they approach things in
the same way a good engineering group at a major oil company
would approach things,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey&#8217;s benchmark ISE National 100
Index climbed 2.1 percent to 60,557.48 at the close in Istanbul,
rising the most in almost two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following were among the active equities in the Turkish
market today. Stock symbols are in parentheses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otokar Otomotiv  Savunma Sanayi AS (OTKAR TI), a producer
of minibuses, buses, jeeps and military vehicles, added 2.1
percent to 29.80 liras. Otokar profit last year was 54.8 million
liras ($31 million), the company said in a filing today, beating
market estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Park Elektrik Uretim Madencilik Sanayi  Ticaret AS (PRKME
TI), a miner and energy company, jumped 4.6 percent to 4.31
liras, its highest since May 9. The company extended its
southeast Turkey mining license to 2037, it said in a filing
with the exchange today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petkim Petrokimya Holding AS (PETKM) , Turkey&#8217;s sole
refiner, increased 3.2 percent to 2.24 liras. The State Oil Co.
of Azerbaijan, which owns Petkim, will invest between $350
million and $400 million to build a container port for Petkim in
western Turkey by 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tofas Turk Otomobil Fabrikasi AS (TOASO) , a manufacturer
of vehicles and parts under license from Fiat, gained 3.1
percent to 7.88 liras. ING Groep NV (INGA) added the stock to its
preferred list for the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turk Hava Yollari (THYAO) AO, or Turkish Airlines,
increased 3.4 percent to 2.73 liras. Passenger numbers rose 22
percent in January from a year ago, it said in a statement to

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s first-
quarter profit estimate was raised 21 percent at International
Strategy  Investment Group Inc. after an oil discovery near
Angola boosted the value of one of the firm&#8217;s investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ed Najarian, an analyst at ISI, raised his earnings per
share estimate to $3.50 from $2.90, according to a research note
he distributed yesterday. Najarian cited the higher value of
Cobalt International Energy Inc. (CIE), a Houston-based deep-water oil
explorer whose stock surged 33 percent on Feb. 10 after it said
test results at an oil discovery off the coast of Angola were
better than expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, owns
19 percent of Cobalt through one of the firm&#8217;s private-equity
funds. Najarian estimates that 70 percent of the investment was
made with client money, with about 30 percent -- or about 6
percent of Cobalt -- owned by Goldman Sachs itself. At the
current price, Cobalt could provide Goldman Sachs with a $365
million private-equity gain, Najarian wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Overall, we now estimate that private-equity and debt
gains should cause Goldman&#8217;s total investing and lending revenue
to jump to about $2 billion&#8221; in the first quarter, Najarian
wrote. The gains probably won&#8217;t recur and the firm may fall
short of consensus earnings in subsequent quarters, Najarian
wrote, so he kept his &#8220;hold&#8221; recommendation on the stock. The
shares advanced 1.2 percent to $115.51 at 9:40 a.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

Energy Affairs Hussain al-Shahristani. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Iraq will ban Exxon Mobil from taking part in the fourth
round if it persists in its position to make deals with the
Kurdistan Regional Government,&#8221; Faisal Abdallah said in a
telephone interview in Baghdad today. He confirmed that Iraqi
authorities had not yet taken a final decision on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq is waiting for Exxon to &#8220;take the right decision&#8221;
and rescind the contract it signed with Kurdish authorities,
Shahristani said in an interview yesterday. He called Exxon&#8217;s
agreement with the Kurds illegal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq&#8217;s central government has so far refused to recognize
production-sharing agreements between foreign companies and
Kurdistan, home to about 40 percent of Iraq&#8217;s 115 billion
barrels of reserves. The central government insists on service
contracts with foreign companies and that it needs to pre-
approve agreements concerning the country&#8217;s energy resources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, which has not commented publicly on the matter,
operates with Royal Dutch Shell Plc in southern Iraq at the West
Qurna field, one of the nation&#8217;s biggest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks will post a further 10
percent rally in 2012, extending advances made so far this year,
as profits grow and the European debt crisis stabilises,
according to JPMorgan Asset Management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest gains will be in emerging-market equities where
earnings expansion will be larger, according to Dan Morris, a
global strategist at JPMorgan, which has $1.3 trillion in client
assets. The MSCI World Index (MXWO) of global shares rose 7.4 percent
this year through Feb. 10 as prospects for an improving U.S.
economy added more than $4.2 trillion to global equity prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If risk aversion continues to fall as the situation in
Europe stabilises, equity prices should be driven less by swings
in sentiment and more by the outlook for company profits,&#8221;
Morris wrote in a report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With earning-per-share gains of around 8 percent, a
dividend yield of nearly 3 percent, and the potential for better
valuations, we believe that equity markets may yet return
another 10 percent this year even after the rebound we have
already seen.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Bank of
America Corp. (BAC), the two biggest U.S. banks by assets, added a
record number of health savings accounts they manage for workers
in 2011, the firms said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employers are increasing the use of so-called HSAs, which
are paired with high-deductible health insurance plans, to shift
more costs to U.S. workers. The accounts generally require
consumers to pay more out of pocket for health care and let them
save for medical expenses in their own accounts. Money
contributed can grow tax-free and carry over from year to year
or to another job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America increased the number of HSAs it administers
by a record 34 percent last year to almost 200,000, totaling
more than $300 million in assets, according to a statement from
the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank today. JPMorgan added a
record number of new accounts in 2011, reaching more than
900,000 as of February compared with about 700,000 in 2010, said
Elena Szymanski, an executive director who manages the HSA
business for the New York-based firm. JPMorgan administers more
than $1.5 billion in HSA balances, the firm said in a report
also released today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to hear from our clients and customers about
health care,&#8221; Justin Raniszeski, health benefit solutions
executive for Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said in a telephone
interview last week. &#8220;They need help affording health care and
controlling costs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies buying health coverage for workers spent the most
this year since 2005 and costs may reach $32,175 for a family in
2021, according to a September report by the Henry J. Kaiser
Family Foundation in Menlo Park, California, and the Chicago-
based American Hospital Association&#8217;s Health Research 
Educational Trust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Costs Rise &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average cost of a family policy climbed 9 percent in
2011 to $15,073, with employees paying 28 percent of premiums,
according to the Kaiser survey. That compares with the average
premium for a high-deductible plan of $13,704 for a family.
Among workers offered health benefits, 17 percent are enrolled
in a high-deductible health plan with a savings option, compared
with 13 percent in 2010, according to the study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To defray costs, companies are offering health benefits
with lower premiums and deductibles of at least $2,400 for a
family plan that are paired with a tax-free medical expense
account such as an HSA, the Kaiser survey showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People are really starting to be able to use these as a
true savings vehicle,&#8221; JPMorgan&#8217;s Elena Szymanski, who is based
in Chicago, said in a telephone interview last week. &#8220;About 74
percent of folks out there contributed more than they spent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rollovers Allowed &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money deposited in HSAs by individuals or their employers
generally isn&#8217;t taxed and may be kept in cash or invested.
Contributions are capped at $3,100 for an individual and $6,250
for families in 2012, according to Internal Revenue Service
rules. Funds in HSAs may be rolled over from year to year and
accounts are portable if workers change jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average balances of HSAs administered by Bank of America
rose to more than $1,600 last year, a 10 percent increase from
2010, according to the statement. At JPMorgan the average HSA
balance increased 4 percent last year to $1,547, the report
showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most HSA account holders keep their savings in cash
to spend on medical expenses during the year, more people are
investing funds as balances rise, said Szymanski. Last year
about 9 percent of individuals with an HSA investment account at
JPMorgan had a balance of more than $20,000, compared with 3
percent in 2009, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like 401(k)s &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals with HSAs at JPMorgan need at least $2,000
before they can start making investments, Szymanski said.
Account holders at Bank of America may invest money in excess of
$1,000, said Raniszeski. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There will be a time where the menus are going to be
diverse like 401(k)s,&#8221; Kevin Crain, head of institutional
retirement and benefit services at Bank of America Merrill
Lynch, said in a telephone interview referring to investment
options in HSAs. Other banks and mutual-fund firms including
Wells Fargo  Co. and Fidelity Investments also administer HSAs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings and withdrawals from the accounts are tax-free if
used for qualified medical expenses, otherwise there&#8217;s a 20
percent penalty, according to IRS rules. After age 65 or
becoming disabled, account holders may take money out of their
HSAs for non-medical reasons without a penalty and pay ordinary
income tax on withdrawals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., Deutsche Bank
AG (DBK) and HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) are among at least seven firms facing a
Canadian probe into whether they participated in a conspiracy to
manipulate prices on interest-rate derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nation&#8217;s Competition Bureau is investigating conduct by
the group -- also including Citigroup Inc. (C), Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc, ICAP Plc and RP Martin Holdings Ltd. --
between 2007 and 2010, according to documents it filed with the
Ontario Superior Court in May. Investigators are examining
whether firms conspired to affect prices on derivatives linked
to the Yen London interbank offered rate, according to the
documents, which were shown to Bloomberg News by court clerks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexa Keating, a spokeswoman for the Competition Bureau,
said in an e-mailed statement that &#8220;there is no conclusion of
wrongdoing at this time and no charges have been laid.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canadian officials opened the case after a &#8220;cooperating
party&#8221; told the bureau that banks, at times facilitated by cash
brokers, agreed to make artificially high or low submissions for
the benchmark rate known as Yen Libor, according to the
documents, which described the informant as a bank involved with
the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators in the U.S., Europe and Asia are investigating
whether financial firms tried to manipulate benchmark interest
rates set by a survey of banks. The rates were used by investors
to gauge firms&#8217; ability to borrow money at the height of 2008&#8217;s
credit crisis and can play a key role in prices on derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Libor Surveys &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libor rates are generated through a daily survey of firms
conducted on behalf of the British Bankers&#8217; Association in
London. The lenders are asked how much it would cost them to
borrow from one another for 15 different periods, from overnight
to one year, in currencies including dollars, euros, yen and
Swiss francs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for New York-based JPMorgan and Citigroup,
Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank, Edinburgh-based RBS and London-
based ICAP said they couldn&#8217;t immediately comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diane Soucy Bergan, a spokeswoman for London-based HSBC in
Chicago, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to requests for comment. A
call after normal business hours to a U.K. phone number listed
on RP Martin&#8217;s website for media inquiries wasn&#8217;t answered, nor
was a call to a number listed for the broker&#8217;s New York office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bureau described the claims in an application for court
orders compelling the companies to provide records, such as e-
mails. The firms may have influenced derivatives trading &#8220;on a
worldwide basis, including in Canada,&#8221; it said. The court
granted the orders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Brokers, Traders &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ICAP broker allegedly told a derivatives trader that he
would try to get London-based brokers to influence banks
participating in setting Yen Libor, according to the bureau. A
trader at HSBC also allegedly communicated with cash brokers,
instructing them to influence the benchmark rate, the bureau
said. Not all attempts to manipulate the rate were successful,
according to an affidavit filed by the bureau. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Canadian officials said they were seeking lists of
individuals responsible for making Yen Libor submissions,
internal communications and records describing so-called Chinese
walls separating workers within the banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They sought a list of interest-rate derivative trades,
including records showing whether the banks made a profit or
loss on them. They also requested records showing the process
banks used to price interest-rate derivatives and how traders
were compensated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cooperating party told the bureau that by manipulating
the rate, the participant banks affected all interest-rate
derivatives that use Yen Libor as a basis for their price,
according to the court filing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)&#8217;s
$699 million settlement with JPMorgan Chase  Co. was unopposed
by creditors as it heads for a court hearing tomorrow, according
to a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the agreement today, JPMorgan will pay bankrupt
Lehman the money, which the bank&#8217;s investment fund affiliates
had claimed as compensation for losses on Lehman investments.
Lehman and its creditors had said the claims weren&#8217;t
&#8220;plausible.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge usually approves such uncontested agreements put
before him. The $699 million was part of an $8.6 billion fight
between Lehman and JPMorgan. Lehman has been trying to recover
the funds, consisting of collateral deposited with the bank
about the time of Lehman&#8217;s 2008 bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit is Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 10-03266, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said a
proposed U.S. ban on banks&#8217; proprietary trading and limits on
their investments in private equity and hedge funds may boost
financial-system risks the measure was designed to curtail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Without substantial revisions, the proposed rule will
define permitted market making-related, underwriting and hedging
activities so narrowly that it will significantly limit our
ability to help our clients,&#8221; John F.W. Rogers, the firm&#8217;s
chief of staff, said in one of two comment letters on proposed
Volcker rule restrictions. The rule would stifle Goldman&#8217;s
ability to help clients &#8220;raise capital, manage their risks,
invest their wealth and generate liquidity,&#8221; he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs joined its banking rivals, including JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM), Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS), in
registering complaints about the 298-page proposal released for
comment by U.S. regulators including the Federal Reserve and the
Securities and Exchange Commission ahead of yesterday&#8217;s public
comment deadline. Regulators, who sought input on more than
1,300 questions in their October proposal, now have until July
21 to complete and implement the rule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers included the rule, named for former Fed Chairman
Paul Volcker, in the Dodd-Frank Act to restrict risky trading by
banks that operate with federal guarantees. The Fed, SEC,
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency invited comment on how the measure would affect
market-making, liquidity, foreign institutions, and private
equity and hedge fund investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Key Aims&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Although one of the key aims of Dodd-Frank was to promote
greater stability in financial markets, we are concerned that
the proposed rule could inadvertently increase systemic risk,&#8221;
Rogers wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the rule makes hedging more expensive, &#8220;banking
entities&#8217; clients and customers will be forced to hold more risk
on their own books,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This will increase the
volatility of their earnings and hurt their share prices, which
in turn will raise their cost of capital, reduce their capacity
to invest, lower their returns to shareholders and diminish
their appeal as strategic partners.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negative consequences &#8220;could be far-ranging,&#8221; with the
Volcker Rule putting U.S. firms at a competitive disadvantage to
their non-U.S. counterparts and imposing costs &#8220;which do not
appear to have been sufficiently analyzed,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lansdowne Partners LP, the largest
European hedge fund that invests in stocks, bought stakes in
Google Inc. (GOOG), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Morgan Stanley and sold shares
of International Business Machines Corp. worth $464.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hedge fund purchased 760,952 shares of Google in the
fourth quarter valued at $491.5 million and 709,250 shares of
Amazon.com valued at $122.8 million, according to a filing today
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The London-
based firm bought 3.1 million shares of Morgan Stanley valued at
$46.7 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lansdowne, which was founded by Paul Ruddock and Steven Heinz in 1998 and oversees about $14.5 billion, sold its IBM (IBM)
stake amid a 25 percent gain in the stock last year. The Armonk,
New York-based firm, the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services
provider, has surged 127 percent since 2008 as clients increased
spending on software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lansdowne sold an earlier stake of 3 million shares of
Morgan Stanley (MS) in the third quarter of last year amid a 50
percent slump for the New York-based bank. Morgan Stanley has
climbed 40 percent since Sept. 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managers who oversee more than $100 million in equities
must file a Form 13F within 45 days of each quarter&#8217;s end to

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s Jeffrey Moslow, an investment banker to companies such as Tyco
International Ltd., plans to leave the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moslow, 47, a partner based in New York, is a former head
of the investment-banking services group and joined the firm in
1994, Goldman Sachs said today in an internal memorandum
disclosing the move. The memo was obtained by Bloomberg News and
confirmed by the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moslow&#8217;s departure is the second by a partner in the
investment bank to be announced this week. Goldman Sachs, the
fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, said yesterday that George
Mattson, head of the industrials investment-banking group, plans
to leave. In the last year, Goldman Sachs has lost about 50
partners, the highest rank of employees who share in a special
compensation pool and are elected every two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Over the course of his career, Jeff played a significant
role in the development of our IBS strategy and has also helped
to recruit, mentor and develop many of our next generation of
coverage bankers,&#8221; Richard Gnodde, David Solomon, and John S. Weinber, the co-heads of investment banking, said in the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment banking services group, which Moslow ran or
co-ran from 2002 to 2008, was founded by former Goldman Sachs
Co-Chairman John Whitehead and consists of bankers focused on
&#8220;covering&#8221; specific clients rather than specializing in a
product such as stock underwriting or merger advice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moslow has been advising Nstar, the Boston-based utility,
on a planned sale to Northeast Utilities, and counseled defense
contractor Dyncorp International Inc. in its 2010 sale to
Cerberus Capital Management LP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is a graduate of Tufts University and Harvard Law
School, according to a profile on the Tufts website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s Kazakh oil venture
plans to spend $5 billion to $6 billion in the next five years
drilling at Tengiz, the Central Asian country&#8217;s biggest
producing field,to sustain output. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TengizChevroil LLP venture will invest $1 billion of
that amount to drill three to four wells this year, starting in
April, General Director Tim Miller told reporters in Almaty
today, without giving a production forecast for 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude output fell 0.4 percent last year to 25.8 million
metric tons, or almost 565,000 barrels a day, the venture said
on Jan. 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The venture wants to invest $15 billion to $20 billion to
raise output through 2016, Deputy Head Anuarbek Dzhakiyev said
in June last year, citing preliminary data. The plan, which
hadn&#8217;t been submitted to Kazakhstan&#8217;s government, is designed to
raise annual output to 36 million metric tons, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO), the biggest
maker of networking equipment, asked a European Union court to
overturn antitrust approval for Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s $8.5 billion
takeover of Skype Technologies SA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission should have required Microsoft to
use open standards for video communications to allow rival
products to work smoothly with Skype before it authorized the
deal, Marthin De Beer, a senior vice-president at San Jose,
California-based Cisco, said in a blog post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft won unconditional approval from the commission,
the EU&#8217;s antitrust agency, in October to buy Skype, the world&#8217;s
most popular international calling service. EU regulators said
the deal wouldn&#8217;t harm competition for video communications
services because the market was growing and they faced
&#8220;numerous players, including Google.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission &#8220;should have placed conditions that would
ensure greater standards-based interoperability, to avoid any
one company from being able to seek to control the future of
video communications,&#8221; said De Beer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is &#8220;confident that the decision will stand up on
appeal,&#8221; said Jesse Verstraete, a Brussels-based spokesman for
the company. EU approval of the deal followed &#8220;a thorough
investigation of the acquisition in which Cisco actively
participated.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission will defend the decision in court, said
Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for the regulator in Brussels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s plans to integrate Skype with its Lync
messaging and teleconferencing software for corporate customers
&#8220;could lock-in&#8221; companies to Microsoft&#8217;s products, Cisco said.
By 2016, video will account for more than 70 percent of all
mobile traffic, up from about 52 percent in 2011, according to
Cisco. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and
Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) sold a $200 million loan backing Apollo
Global Management LLC&#8217;s 2011 buyout of CKX Inc. (CKXE), the owner of
the television show &#8220;American Idol&#8221;, at the steepest discount
on record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first-lien credit was sold for 78 cents on the dollar,
according to three people familiar with the transaction, who
declined to be identified because the deal is private. That&#8217;s
the biggest so-called original issue discount for U.S. bank
debt, according to Standard  Poor&#8217;s Leveraged Commentary 
Data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loan sale allows the banks to reduce their exposure to
CKX after the company failed to sell $360 million in bonds in
July to pay for the $509 million buyout by Leon Black&#8217;s Apollo
after credit markets weakened due to Europe&#8217;s debt crisis. The
discount on New York-based CKX&#8217;s term loan follows a decline in
viewership of the company&#8217;s &#8220;American Idol&#8221;, according to
Michael Altberg, a credit analyst with SP in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re heavily reliant on &#8216;American Idol&#8217;,&#8221; Altberg
said in a telephone interview. &#8220;While the show might have more
near-term visibility, in five, six years from now there&#8217;s a lot
more risk around where that show will be.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original issue discount on CKX&#8217;s first-lien loan is
about 20 cents below the average in January of 98.14 cents on
the dollar for loans rated B+/B, data from SP&#8217;s LCD show. The
OID reduces proceeds for borrowers and can cut underwriting
profits for banks while boosting yield for investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fewer Viewers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;American Idol,&#8221; the most-watched series on U.S.
television, drew 17 percent fewer viewers for the debut of its
11th season last month than for its 2011 premiere. This year&#8217;s
show attracted 21.9 million viewers, News Corp. (NWS)&#8217;s Fox network
said in an e-mailed statement on Jan. 19, citing Nielsen data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &#8220;high concentration&#8221; of CKX&#8217;s earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization come from &#8220;American Idol&#8221;
and related revenue, according to a Jan. 18 report from Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s lowered CKX&#8217;s ranking to B3, six levels below
investment grade, from B2 when CKX was taken private by Apollo
in June. Junk debt is rated less than Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s and below
BBB- by SP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CKX, which owns rights to the name, image and likeness of
Elvis Presley and Muhammad Ali, had about $258 million of
revenue in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, according to Moody&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Results have been a little weaker than we had
anticipated, and their show Viva Elvis in Las Vegas is expected
to be canceled,&#8221; Scott Van den Bosch, senior analyst at
Moody&#8217;s, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;Those events have been
weighing on the company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bridge Loan &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CKX&#8217;s bridge financing was replaced by a $200 million
first-lien loan due in 2017 and a $160 million second-lien
portion maturing in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The term loans do not amortize, which means there&#8217;s no
requirement to pay down these term loans over time,&#8221; said SP&#8217;s
Altberg. &#8220;So there is the risk of these bullet maturities 5 to
6 years from now.&#8221; A so-called bullet maturity means the entire
principal amount is due in a lump sum payment when the debt
expires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s first-lien loan will pay interest at 9
percent, according to a fourth person with knowledge of the
matter, who also declined to be identified because the
transaction is private. The debt has 15 percent yield-to-
maturity, said three people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Benson, chief financial officer at CKX, Tiffany Galvin, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, and Paula Chirhart, a
spokeswoman for Macquarie, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bondlike &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a loan but it&#8217;s structured like a bond,&#8221; Moody&#8217;s
Van den Bosch said. &#8220;It&#8217;s fixed rate, there&#8217;s no amortization
payment, it&#8217;s covenant-lite and the incurrence test is the only
limitation that restricts additional debt from being issued.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incurrence tests require the borrower to be in compliance
with certain financial ratios only when it is seeking a specific
action such as a dividend or acquisition. First-lien debt is
repaid first in a bankruptcy or liquidation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CKX&#8217;s leverage is &#8220;moderately high&#8221; with debt to Ebitda
of 4.9 times, according to Moody&#8217;s, including lease expenses and
preferred shares treated as debt. The ratings company gave a B1
grade to CKX&#8217;s $200 million first-lien loan and Caa2 to its $160
million second-lien loan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think &#8216;American Idol&#8217;s&#8217; performance will be relatively
stable over the next few seasons,&#8221; said SP&#8217;s Altberg. &#8220;It&#8217;s
the longer term outlook that has less certainty. They have to
basically find new shows that are going to work that will help
to replenish their portfolio down the line.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended
its clients exit the bets that the Mexican peso and the euro
will rise against the dollar, citing &#8220;significant
uncertainties&#8221; surrounding the Greece bailout negotiations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wagers on the euro and the peso have returned 0.3
percent and 2.9 percent, respectively, since Goldman recommended
them on Jan. 25, analysts led by London-based Thomas Stolper
wrote in a note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the very near term, the risk-reward for our
recommendations has deteriorated,&#8221; the analysts said in the
report. &#8220;The compression in sovereign risk premia has run most
of its course. The next few weeks will see significant
uncertainties linked&#8221; to the Greek bailout negotiation, the
analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro fell for a fourth day, declining 0.5 percent to
$1.3068 as of 11:16 a.m. New York time. The peso dropped 0.3
percent to 12.7932 per dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs had expected the euro to rise to $1.38 and
the peso to advance to 12 per dollar when it made the
recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. authorities are investigating
whether a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) technology analyst leaked
insider information to hedge funds, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing people close to the situation it didn&#8217;t name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henry King, who is based in Hong Kong, took a leave from
his position after traveling to the U.S. earlier this year,
Goldman Sachs clients were told, according to the report. Edward Naylor, a Hong Kong-based spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined
to comment on the report when contacted by Bloomberg News today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taiwan is home to Foxconn Technology Group, which assembles
Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPhone, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.,
which manufactures for Qualcomm Inc. and Intel Corp. Technology
stocks have the largest collective weighting in Taiwan&#8217;s Taiex
index, with four of the benchmark&#8217;s top 10 stocks being
technology companies, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives from the Manhattan U.S. attorney&#8217;s office
and the Federal Bureau of Investigation declined to comment, the
Journal reported. King, co-head of Asia technology research and
New York-based Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Taiwan research head, didn&#8217;t
return calls for comment, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King covered Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Lenovo Group
Ltd. and Acer Inc., among other companies, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Goldman Sachs director Rajat Gupta was accused in
October by Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara of passing
inside information to Raj Rajaratnam, the co-founder of Galleon
Group LLC. The U.S. says Gupta tipped Rajaratnam about Goldman
Sachs and Procter  Gamble Co. earnings. Rajaratnam was
convicted of insider trading in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taiwan&#8217;s black market for business intelligence and its

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan
Stanley (MS), the two Wall Street banks most reliant on trading,
warned U.S. regulators that a proposed ban on proprietary
trading could make the financial system more risky and curtail
services for clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based banks, along with competitors Bank of
America Corp., Citigroup Inc. (C) and JPMorgan Chase  Co., are
pushing to limit the reach of the Volcker rule, a ban on
proprietary trading included in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. A draft
of the rule, which takes effect in July, was released by U.S.
regulators in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Without substantial revisions, the proposed rule will
define permitted market making-related, underwriting and hedging
activities so narrowly that it will significantly limit our
ability to help our clients,&#8221; John F.W. Rogers, Goldman Sach&#8217;s
chief of staff, said in a comment letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Although one of the key aims of Dodd-Frank was to promote
greater stability in financial markets, we are concerned that
the proposed rule could inadvertently increase systemic risk,&#8221;
he added. If the rule makes hedging more expensive, &#8220;banking
entities&#8217; clients and customers will be forced to hold more risk
on their own books.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve, Securities and Exchange Commission and
other financial regulators received thousands of comments
letters by the Feb. 13 deadline. A number of the world&#8217;s largest
banks questioned whether regulators took into account how they
conduct business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Real Misconception&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There appears to be a real misconception about how
principal market makers generate revenues,&#8221; Colm Kelleher, who
runs Morgan Stanley&#8217;s trading business, and Chief Operating
Officer Jim Rosenthal, wrote in the firm&#8217;s comment letter. &#8220;The
proposal should be revised to reflect the realities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley generated about 44 percent of its revenue
last year from trading. In the letter, the bank officers argued
that the proposed rule fails to adequately distinguish between
permitted market making and prohibited proprietary trading, and
they objected to a provision requiring market makers to generate
most of their revenue from commissions, fees and bid-ask
spreads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed rule has a &#8220;narrow view&#8221; of market-making,
underwriting and hedging activities that is based on liquid
exchange-traded U.S. markets, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Rogers said. The
rule doesn&#8217;t account for trading that is currently conducted in
less liquid or over-the-counter markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Rigid Application&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The proposed rule&#8217;s rigid application of an agency-based,
exchange-traded equities paradigm threatens to reduce liquidity
in these markets,&#8221; Rogers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule may hurt banks&#8217; ability to underwrite corporate
bonds by restricting their ability to hold bonds as inventory
during a bond issuance, which could then increase costs for
issuers, according to the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two men responsible for the provision&#8217;s inclusion in
the Dodd-Frank Act -- Democratic Senators Carl Levin of Michigan
and Jeff Merkley of Oregon -- urged regulators to be more
forceful in implementing the rule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Volcker rule demands Wall Street change its
culture,&#8221; Merkley and Levin wrote in their own comment letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two senators insisted that the rule is not as
complicated as the banks maintain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If a firm is holding onto a position in a way that
principally profits from price changes in the instrument and it
is being held for a period that indicates the holding was not a
long-term investment or the extension of credit, then that
should be considered prohibited proprietary trading,&#8221; the
senators wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conflicts of Interest &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin and Merkley also pushed for a more detailed account
of bank activities that may be banned by regulators as well as
an explicit ban on conflicts of interest. Levin has cited the
ban as a response to a Senate investigation he oversaw into the
financial crisis that faulted Goldman Sachs&#8217; trading practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which accounted for 60 percent of its
revenue through trading in 2011, has already shuttered its
standalone proprietary trading desk. No matter how the final
version of the Volcker rule comes out, Rogers said Goldman Sachs
recognizes that Wall Street is in a time of change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are not arguing that the line between permitted
activities and prohibited proprietary trading be drawn in such a
way as to permit all activities in which we have historically
engaged,&#8221; Rogers wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., Deutsche Bank
AG (DBK) and HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) are among at least seven firms accused
by another bank of participating in a conspiracy to manipulate 
the price of derivatives worldwide for more than three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unnamed bank, seeking immunity, told Canada&#8217;s
Competition Bureau that traders and cash brokers conspired to
influence the Yen London interbank offered rate from 2007 to
2010 to profit on interest-rate derivative positions linked to
the benchmark. The bureau spelled out the probe in documents it
filed with the Ontario Superior Court in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documents, shown yesterday to Bloomberg News by court
clerks, offer one of the most detailed accounts yet as watchdogs
in Europe, Asia and the U.S. look into concerns that firms
conspired to manipulate interest rates serving as benchmarks for
trillions of dollars of financial products. Canada also is
investigating Citigroup Inc. (C), Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS),
ICAP Plc (IAP) and RP Martin Holdings Ltd., the court documents show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is no conclusion of wrongdoing at this time and no
charges have been laid,&#8221; Alexa Keating, a spokeswoman for the
Competition Bureau, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libor rates are generated through a daily survey of firms
conducted on behalf of the British Bankers&#8217; Association in
London. The lenders are asked how much it would cost them to
borrow from one another for 15 different periods, from overnight
to one year, in currencies including dollars, euros, yen and
Swiss francs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Communications Among Firms &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canadian officials, who were seeking records from the
companies, said the cooperator claimed that the banks&#8217; employees
agreed to make artificially high or low submissions for Yen
Libor to improve the outcomes of trades tied to the rate.
According to the documents, banks communicated with one another
and with cash brokers to form agreements. In some cases,
derivatives traders allegedly asked cash brokers to help
influence submissions for Yen Libor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for New York-based JPMorgan and Citigroup,
Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank (DBK), Edinburgh-based RBS and London-
based ICAP declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diane Soucy Bergan, a spokeswoman for London-based HSBC in
Chicago, didn&#8217;t respond to requests for comment. A call after
normal business hours to a U.K. phone number listed on RP
Martin&#8217;s website for media inquiries wasn&#8217;t answered, nor was a
call to a number listed for the broker&#8217;s New York office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Documents Sought &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ICAP broker was accused of telling a derivatives trader
that he would try to get London-based brokers to influence banks
participating in setting Yen Libor, according to the bureau. A
trader at HSBC also allegedly communicated with cash brokers,
instructing them to influence the benchmark rate, the bureau
said. Not all attempts to manipulate the rate were successful,
according to an affidavit filed by the bureau. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICAP is the world&#8217;s largest broker of transactions between
banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Canadian officials said they were seeking lists of
people responsible for making Yen Libor submissions, internal
communications and records describing so-called Chinese walls
separating workers within the banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They sought a list of interest-rate derivative trades,
including records showing whether the banks made a profit or
loss on them. They also requested records showing the process
banks used to price interest-rate derivatives and how traders
were compensated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bureau said it became aware of the case when it was
approached by the bank seeking to take advantage of an immunity
program. A lawyer for the company told the bureau that by
manipulating the rate, participating banks affected all
interest-rate derivatives that use Yen Libor as a basis for
their price, according to the court filing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks advanced, sending the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index near the highest level in about
three years, amid better-than-estimated economic reports and
optimism that Greece will receive a second bailout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial (S5FINL) shares rebounded from earlier losses as Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) rose 4 percent. Microsoft (MSFT) Corp. climbed 4.1
percent on a report that SP is likely to increase its weighting
in the SP 500. General Motors Co. (GM) jumped 9 percent after the
automaker posted the biggest annual profit in its 103-year-
history. NetApp (NTAP) Inc. increased 7.2 percent as the maker of data-
storage products reported revenue that beat analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 rose 1.1 percent to 1,358.04 at 4 p.m. New York
time. The benchmark gauge for American equities is 0.4 percent
away from its peak nine months ago of 1,363.61, which was the
highest level since June 2008. The Dow (INDU) Jones Industrial Average
increased 123.13 points, or 1 percent, to 12,904.08. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t see what the case is for the market collapsing,&#8221;
Brian Barish, who helps oversee about $7 billion as Denver-based
president of Cambiar Investors LLC., said in a phone interview.
&#8220;The U.S. economy is doing pretty well. Taking the possibility
of a euro-Lehman type of event off the table, that has a big
effect on sentiment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks rose as Americans filed the fewest claims for
jobless benefits since 2008 and builders broke ground on more
homes than forecast. Manufacturing (OUTFGAF) in the Philadelphia region
expanded in February at the fastest pace in four months as
orders and sales picked up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Bonds &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benchmark gauges extended gains and banks rallied as three
euro-area officials said the European Central Bank is swapping
its Greek bonds for new ones to ensure it isn&#8217;t forced to take
losses in a debt restructuring. European governments are
considering cutting interest rates on emergency loans to Greece
and using contributions from the ECB to plug a new financing gap
in the second bailout program for Athens, two people familiar
with the discussions said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re more important to Europe than Europe is to us,&#8221;
Liz Ann Sonders, the New York-based chief investment strategist
at Charles Schwab Corp., said in a telephone interview. Her firm
has $1.68 trillion in client assets. &#8220;U.S. economic numbers
have been much better than expected. I&#8217;m pretty optimistic, but
I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re going to boom. The debt overhang puts a lid
on how fast the U.S. economy can grow.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial shares underperformed the SP 500 earlier today
as Moody&#8217;s Investors Service is reviewing 17 banks and
securities firms with global capital markets operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Banks Rebound &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The KBW Bank Index (BKX) rose 2.2 percent as all of its 24
companies gained. The gauge fell as much as 0.6 percent earlier
today. Bank of America added 4 percent to $8.09. Morgan Stanley
rose 1.2 percent to $19.19, after tumbling as much as 4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-nine out of 30 companies in the Dow gained today.
Microsoft jumped 4.1 percent, the most in the Dow, to $31.29.
The shares rose to the highest price since April 2010. SP is
likely to increase Microsoft&#8217;s weighting in the SP 500 by about
12 percent later this year because Chairman Bill Gates&#8217;s stock
sales are increasing the amount of shares available for public
trading, Adam Holt, an analyst at Morgan Stanley (MS), wrote in a
report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM surged 9 percent to $27.17. North America earnings
before interest and taxes more than tripled for the year to
$7.19 billion. The automaker&#8217;s Europe business, including the
Opel brand, lost $747 million for the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Customers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NetApp rallied 7.2 percent, the most in the SP 500, to
$42.74. The maker of data-storage products said revenue in the
third quarter was $1.57 billion, above the average analyst
estimate of $1.56 billion. The company said it won a record
number of new customers and significantly increased the amount
of units shipped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CVR Energy Inc. (CVI) surged 5.8 percent to $29.20. Carl Icahn
offered to pay $30 a share in cash and give stockholders the
right to collect an additional $7 a share if any other bidder
tries to buy the oil-refining company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with the stock&#8217;s 24 percent gain since Icahn disclosed
an investment in January, a buyer could offer about a 40 percent
premium and still purchase CVR at the lowest valuation relative
to earnings of any takeover greater than $500 million in the
U.S. oil refining and marketing industry, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Icahn, CVR&#8217;s biggest investor, urged the
company this week to put itself up for sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) sank 2.5 percent to $179.93. The world&#8217;s
largest Web retailer fell after Morgan Stanley downgraded the
stock, citing competition from Apple Inc. and the decline of
traditional media such as CDs and video games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Folgers Coffee &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J.M. Smucker Co. (SJM) slumped 8.4 percent to $71.60. The maker
of Folgers coffee forecast 2012 earnings excluding some items of
$4.65 a share at most. On average, the analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg estimated profit of $5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gauge of homebuilders in SP indexes dropped 0.8 percent.
PulteGroup Inc., the largest U.S. homebuilder by revenue,
declined 1.8 percent to $8.87. The shares retreated after David
Goldberg, an analyst at UBS AG, cut the rating to &#8220;neutral&#8221;
from &#8220;buy,&#8221; citing valuation concern. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Price swings by the SP 500 have narrowed to a nine-month
low following the measure&#8217;s biggest rally to start a year since
1997. The distance between its intraday low and high has
averaged 0.86 percent since Feb. 2, a 10-day level last seen on
May 5, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volatility (SPX) has diminished after the SP 500 advanced 6.8
percent in 2012. When the 10-day average swing was this low in
May, the index had just peaked on April 29 and went on to slump
19 percent through October. The current narrowing signals the
rally may be running out of steam, said Katie Stockton, chief
market technician at Greenwich, Connecticut-based MKM Partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It reflects a loss of momentum, which had been very
strong until last week,&#8221; Stockton wrote in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;

epinephrine e-cue auto injector, beginning Nov. 15, according to
the settlement with Pfizer&#8217;s Meridian Medical Technologies,
Mylan and Pfizer said in a statement today. The sales are
contingent upon final approval from the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased with this settlement,&#8221; said Mylan Chief
Executive Officer Heather Bresch. &#8220;In addition to our
significant efforts in this area, people with&#160;life-threatening
allergic reactions&#160;will benefit from more voices in the fight&#8221;
against such reactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial lawsuit was filed in January 2011 in federal
court in Wilmington, Delaware, by Meridian, which makes the
EpiPen, alleging the Intelliject product would infringe a U.S.
patent. Further terms of the settlement weren&#8217;t released. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mylan is based in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, and Pfizer is
based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UBS AG (UBSN), Switzerland&#8217;s biggest bank,
sought immunity from prosecution by Canadian regulators probing
a potential conspiracy to rig the price of derivatives globally,
three people with knowledge of the inquiry said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lender is the cooperating party referred to by Canada&#8217;s
Competition Bureau in court papers filed by the regulator with
the Ontario Superior Court in May, said the people, who declined
to be identified because the identity of the firm hasn&#8217;t been
made public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The papers, shown this week to Bloomberg News by court
clerks, indicate a bank told the regulator that traders and cash
brokers conspired to influence the Yen London interbank offered
rate from 2007 to 2010 to profit on interest-rate derivatives
linked to the benchmark. Regulators worldwide are investigating
whether banks attempted to manipulate the London, Tokyo and euro
interbank offered rates, known as Libor, Tibor and Euribor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS has also suspended a number of employees including Yvan
Ducrot, co-head of rates, and Holger Seger, global head of
short-term interest rates trading, as part of an investigation
of its rate submissions, said a person briefed on the matter who
declined to be identified because the decision is private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank has already been given conditional immunity by the
Swiss Competition Commission as part of an investigation into
suspected manipulation of the Yen Libor, Tibor and Swiss franc
Libor rates. The Zurich-based lender was granted similar
immunity by the U.S. Department of Justice last year as part of
its probes of Yen Libor and Euroyen Tibor rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dominik von Arx, a spokesman for UBS in London, declined to
comment on the court case. Alexa Keating, a spokeswoman for the
Competition Bureau, declined to comment on the identity of the
cooperating party. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is no conclusion of wrongdoing at this time and no
charges have been laid,&#8221; Keating said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither Ducrot nor Seger were reachable through their
office telephone numbers and neither responded to e-mails
through LinkedIn. A profile under Seger&#8217;s name says he oversees
70 traders worldwide. The Financial Times reported the
suspensions earlier today. Von Arx declined to comment on the
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the affidavit filed by the bureau, Canadian
officials were informed that HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA), JPMorgan Chase 
Co., Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc, ICAP Plc (IAP) and RP Martin Holdings Ltd. took part in the
scheme. Employees at the banks agreed to make artificially high
or low submissions for Yen Libor to improve the outcomes of
trades tied to the rate, the Canadian regulator said, citing
information it received under the immunity program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documents also describe similar communications
involving traders at other banks. For instance, Peter O&#8217;Leary, a
trader at HSBC, allegedly instructed cash brokers on how to
influence the benchmark rate, the bureau said. It also described
communications involving London-based traders Guillaume Adolph
at Deutsche Bank, Stuart Wiley at JPMorgan and Brent Davies at
RBS, as well as former RBS employee Will Hall and former
JPMorgan employee Paul Glands. The bureau hasn&#8217;t brought claims
against any of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiley and Glands declined to comment. Davies didn&#8217;t return
calls to his mobile phone. There was no response to an e-mail
sent to an address found for O&#8217;Leary. Contact information for
Adolph and Hall couldn&#8217;t be located through directory assistance
and in an Internet search. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for New York-based JPMorgan and Citigroup,
Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank, Edinburgh-based RBS and London-
based ICAP have declined to comment on the affidavit. A
spokeswoman for London-based HSBC didn&#8217;t respond to requests for
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tavistock Communications, which handles media inquiries for
RP Martin, issued a statement saying, &#8220;RP Martin has received
requests from certain regulators to provide information on a
voluntary basis to assist them with their preliminary inquiries
but no formal allegations have been made against RP Martin by
any regulator.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Goldman Sachs Analyst Inquiry Said to Show U.S. Focus on Taiwan &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation of a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) analyst
shows U.S. officials have intensified their focus on banks and
Taiwan in a multiyear insider-trading probe that has implicated
hedge funds, technology company employees and consultants, a
person familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation of Henry King, the Goldman Sachs analyst
covering Taiwan, shows federal authorities are expanding the
insider-trading probe by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in
Manhattan and the FBI in New York, said the person, who didn&#8217;t
want to be identified because the matter isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probe, called operation &#8220;Perfect Hedge,&#8221; began five
years ago and has resulted in insider-trading and securities
fraud charges being filed against 64 people, with more than 50
since 2009 either pleading guilty or being convicted at trial.
They included Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam, who
is serving an 11-year prison term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Margolin, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of
Investigation in New York, declined to comment on the case, or
whether King is cooperating. King didn&#8217;t answer calls to his
Hong Kong office number yesterday. E-mails to his company
account received an auto reply saying he&#8217;s out of the country on
a personal matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to
comment on the investigation of King, or whether he remains a
bank employee or is on leave. Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for
Bharara, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King, based in Hong Kong, covers Taiwanese companies
including Quanta Computer Inc. and Compal Electronics Inc., the
world&#8217;s two largest manufacturers of notebook computers for
clients including Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) and Dell Inc. (DELL), according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King, who joined Goldman Sachs in 2002, was named head of
Taiwan research in 2005. Prior to New York-based Goldman Sachs,
he worked at Credit Suisse First Boston and Indosuez W.I. Carr
Securities Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bharara&#8217;s office in October indicted Rajat Gupta, a former
Goldman Sachs and Procter  Gamble Co. director, with leaking
material, nonpublic information to Rajaratnam about the two
companies. Gupta has denied wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said in a Feb. 3 letter to U.S. District Judge
Jed Rakoff, who is presiding over Gupta&#8217;s case in Manhattan,
that they had witness statements that there was a second
&#8220;insider&#8221; at Goldman Sachs who leaked tips to Rajaratnam that
&#8220;did not relate to Goldman and/or Procter  Gamble.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors didn&#8217;t disclose which stocks the second unnamed
tipper, who Rakoff called &#8220;Mr. X,&#8221; had allegedly disclosed to
Rajaratnam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta&#8217;s lawyer, Gary Naftalis, declined to comment about
King, or other Goldman Sachs sources Rajaratnam may have had for
illegal tips. Naftalis has argued in court that he should be
permitted to use such information while defending Gupta at
trial. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New Suits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Olympus Former Chairman and Six Others Arrested Over Fraud &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three former executives at Olympus Corp. (7733), including ex-
chairman Tsuyoshi Kikukawa, and four others were arrested for
suspected violation of Japan&#8217;s Financial Instruments and
Exchange Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The camera maker is facing shareholder lawsuits and may be
subject to further criminal investigation after admitting to a
13-year cover-up. The company restated past securities reports
and took a $1.3 billion reduction in net assets in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olympus&#8217;s Tokyo headquarters and its affiliated offices
were raided in December by prosecutors after the company said
Kikukawa and two others colluded to hide investment losses from
the 1990s. The stock has plunged 49 percent since the Oct. 14
dismissal of its first non-Japanese president, Michael Woodford,
who later publicly questioned inflated takeover costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kikukawa, 70, who headed Olympus for 10 years until last
year, Hideo Yamada, 67, who led the investment unit since the
1980s and later became an auditing officer, and former Executive
Vice President Hisashi Mori concealed losses, booked overstated
goodwill and falsified financial statements, the prosecutors
said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prosecutors also arrested Akio Nakagawa, cited in a
December panel report as having aided Olympus in structuring its
loss-hiding schemes. Nobumasa Yokoo, who was also named in the
report, Taku Hada and Hiroshi Ono, were arrested by the Tokyo
Metropolitan Police, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We take the situation seriously,&#8221; Yoshiaki Yamada, a
spokesman for Olympus, said by phone yesterday. &#8220;We will
cooperate fully with investigators.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a press conference in London this morning, former
president Woodford said, while the arrests were encouraging,
&#8220;there are still many important issues which are not covered by
today&#8217;s announcement.&#8221; He called for further investigation into
the role of banks and accounting firms in the fraud, and said
three directors at the company -- Masataka Suzuki, Kazuhiro
Watanabe and Shinichi Nishigaki -- should be replaced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olympus sued 19 current and former executives, including
current President Shuichi Takayama and five corporate auditors,
in January over their roles in concealing losses. The company
formed panels to reform management and nominate a new board. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;UBS Claims Two Ex-Advisers Took Customer Data to Wells Fargo &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A UBS AG brokerage unit sued two former financial advisers
in Chicago, claiming they took confidential trade secret
information including customer account data to competitor Wells
Fargo (WFC) Advisers LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Named as defendants in the lawsuit filed yesterday by UBS
Financial Services Inc. are David Kinnear and Kathleen Bakas,
who allegedly resigned two days ago to join the Wells Fargo 
Co. unit. One full-time and one part-time UBS employee, all part
of Kinnear&#8217;s wealth-management group, went with them, according
to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Led by Kinnear, the team serviced accounts that generated
more than $3.7 million in revenues for UBS over the past 12
months of the defendants&#8217; employment,&#8221; UBS alleged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based brokerage unit of Zurich-based UBS seeks
a court order blocking the defendants and any Wells Fargo
representative from soliciting any UBS client Kinnear or Bakas
had advised while there, preventing the disclosure of any
proprietary UBS information and directing its return. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS also seeks expedited arbitration of its claims through
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ancel Martinez, a spokesman for San Francisco-based Wells
Fargo, which isn&#8217;t a party to the suit, couldn&#8217;t immediately
comment on the case. Kinnear and Bakas didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to e-mail messages seeking comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is UBS Financial Services Inc. v. Kinnear,
12CH05333, Cook County, Illinois, Circuit Court, Chancery
Division (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deutsche Bank Sued Over $512 Million in Mortgage Securities &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)&#8217;s Ace Securities was sued in New York
state court for fraud for allegedly misrepresenting the quality
of $512 million worth of residential mortgage-backed securities
by Phoenix Light SF Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phoenix Light, which bought and later sold the securities,
is seeking at least $300 million in damages, according to a
summons filed yesterday. It accuses Ace Securities of making
&#8220;material misrepresentations and omissions&#8221; regarding
underwriting standards used to issue the mortgage loans that
were pooled together into the offerings, according to court
filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ace Securities knew about problems with the mortgages
underlying the securities because of reports they received from
mortgage-review firm Clayton Holdings, yet still included them
in the offerings that were sold to the plaintiffs, according to
Phoenix Light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The securities have performed worse than expected due to
the poorer-quality collateral, and defendants&#8217; wrongdoing has
led directly to plaintiffs&#8217; damages, which include loss of
market value on the securities,&#8221; Phoenix Light said in the
filing. &#8220;Plaintiffs have lost the entire value of certain of
the securities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duncan King, a New York spokesman for Frankfurt-based
Deutsche Bank, said in a phone interview that the claims had no
merit and the company would fight the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Phoenix Light SF Ltd. v. Ace Securities Corp.,
650422/2012, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Syncora Guarantee Sues EMC Over Mortgage-Backed Securities &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syncora (SYCRF) Guarantee Inc. sued JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s EMC
Mortgage unit over mortgage-backed securities, alleging fraud
and breach of contract in a lawsuit filed in New York state
court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit was brought in connection with a transaction known
as SACO I Trust 2006-1, which involved the securitization of
residential mortgage loans with an aggregate principal balance
of more than $310 million, Syncora said in the complaint. That
transaction served as collateral for the issuance of about $303
million in securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EMC Mortgage was a unit of Bear Stearns Cos. until the
investment bank was bought by JPMorgan in 2008. Bear Stearns and
EMC obtained a financial-guaranty insurance policy from New
York-based bond insurer Syncora &#8220;to enhance the marketability
of the securities and their return on the transaction,&#8221;
according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns made &#8220;materially false and misleading
representations to induce Syncora to insure the transaction,&#8221;
and didn&#8217;t conduct &#8220;extensive due diligence&#8221; as it had
promised, lawyers for the bond insurer said in the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction had experienced cumulative losses of $96.7
million as of Sept. 30, which has resulted in Syncora making
more than $51.9 million in claim payments, the complaint says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan Chase, declined to comment on the lawsuit in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Syncora Guarantee Inc. v. EMC Mortgage LLC,
650420/2012, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ex-Aluminium Bahrain Executive Charged by U.K. With Corruption &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. prosecutors charged Bruce Allan Hall with corruption
and money laundering tied to his time as an executive at
Aluminium Bahrain B.S.C., a smelting company in Bahrain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Australian national, Hall was released on conditional
bail and must appear at a London criminal court next month, the
Serious Fraud Office said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. He
is accused of accepting bribes over an eight-year period while
he worked at the company, known as Alba, the prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hall was extradited from Australia to London to face the
charges, the SFO said. His co-defendant in the case, British
investor Victor Dahdaleh, is also scheduled to appear at the
same court hearing, the SFO said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dahdaleh was charged Oct. 24 with six counts of making
corrupt payments, two counts of money laundering, and one charge
of conspiracy to corrupt. He is accused of paying bribes to Alba
officials to win contracts for Alcoa Inc. (AA), the largest U.S.
aluminum producer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efforts to reach Hall or an attorney representing him were
unsuccessful. A call to the SFO wasn&#8217;t immediately returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Taleo Sued by Shareholder Over $1.9 Billion Oracle Offer &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taleo Corp. (TLEO) was sued by an investor claiming the human-
resources software company failed to get the best price in its
planned $1.9 billion acquisition by Oracle Corp. (ORCL) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hillary Coyne contends Taleo directors are duty-bound to
maximize shareholder value in such a sale, and violated that
duty by agreeing to the $46 per-share buyout, according to a
complaint filed Feb. 14 in Delaware Chancery Court in
Wilmington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offer &#8220;does not account for Taleo&#8217;s expected future
growth,&#8221; and &#8220;particularly its July 2011 acquisition of
JobPartners, which significantly expanded the company&#8217;s presence
in Europe,&#8221; Coyne&#8217;s lawyers said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle, based in Redwood City, California, said Feb. 9 it
would buy Taleo in part to expand so-called cloud computing,
which provides software, storage and other services from remote
data centers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caroline Japic, a spokeswoman for Dublin, California-based
Taleo, declined to comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Coyne v. Taleo, CA7245, Delaware Chancery Court
(Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BofA Seeks to Change Venue on $8.5 Billion Mortgage Deal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. and a group of investors that reached
an $8.5 billion mortgage-bond settlement with the bank are
seeking to overturn a ruling that kept the deal before a federal
judge for review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, and
the investor group, which includes BlackRock Inc. (BLK), have said the
settlement over Countrywide Financial Corp. mortgage bonds
should be considered by a state court in New York, where it was
first filed last year for approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This case does not belong in federal court at all,&#8221;
Charles Rothfeld, a lawyer for Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK),
which is seeking approval of the settlement, said at a hearing
yesterday before the U.S. Appeals Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accord would resolve claims from investors about
defective Countrywide mortgages underlying their securities. The
deal has the support of the investors that negotiated it,
including BlackRock and Pacific Investment Management Co.
American International Group Inc. (AIG) and others are opposed or have
demanded more information to evaluate it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan in October
ruled that the settlement should be considered in federal court
for approval because it &#8220;implicates core federal interests in
the integrity of nationally chartered banks and the vitality of
the national securities markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, the investor group and Bank of New York,
the trustee for the mortgage securitization trusts, are asking
the appeals court to overturn Pauley&#8217;s ruling. Under the federal
Class Action Fairness Act, it should be returned to state court,
they said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entities under the name Walnut Place, which own Countrywide
mortgage bonds, said the case should remain in federal court.
Bank of New York is trying to obtain approval for one of the
largest class-action settlements in history &#8220;without providing
adequate protection&#8221; for investors, Walnut Place said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bank of New York Mellon v. Walnut Place LLC,
11-cv-05988, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Macy&#8217;s Says Martha Stewart Living Is Holding It &#8216;Hostage&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. (MSO) is &#8220;essentially
holding Macy&#8217;s hostage&#8221; by saying that its pact with the
department-store chain expires in January 2013, Macy&#8217;s Inc. (M) said
in court papers in their contract dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macy&#8217;s sued in January to stop New York-based Martha
Stewart Living from executing an agreement to sell merchandise
in J.C. Penney Co. stores. Macy&#8217;s, based in Cincinnati, said it
has the exclusive right to sell Martha Stewart-branded products
in certain categories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martha Stewart Living fired back last week, accusing Macy&#8217;s
of breach of contract and saying that the retailer has stocked
and priced Martha Stewart products in a manner that favors
Macy&#8217;s own private-label brands. Martha Stewart Living also said
Macy&#8217;s couldn&#8217;t have exercised a five-year renewal option on the
deal between the two companies because of the breach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The uncertainty created by MSLO&#8217;s breach has put Macy&#8217;s
in an inequitable and untenable position,&#8221; Macy&#8217;s said in
papers filed Feb. 14 in New York state Supreme Court. &#8220;If the
agreement were to actually expire in January 2013, Macy&#8217;s would
have to immediately begin seeking to replace and wind down the
Martha Stewart product line at Macy&#8217;s.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeanne Meyer, a spokeswoman for Martha Stewart Living, said
the company stands behind earlier statements and what has been
said in court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Macy&#8217;s Inc. v. Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia
Inc., 650197/2012, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan, Lehman Trade Data on Bank&#8217;s $6 Billion Claim &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ),
after getting a judge&#8217;s approval yesterday to settle a $699
million dispute, are trading documents in a fight over a sum
that&#8217;s almost 10 times larger, according to a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. bank, which lent $70 billion to Lehman&#8217;s
brokerage around the time of the 2008 bankruptcy, says it is
still owed $6.3 billion by the defunct firm and its brokerage.
Lehman, which termed the claim &#8220;significantly overstated,&#8221;
agreed that certain shared documents and information should be
treated confidentially, according to yesterday&#8217;s filing in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fight relates to JPMorgan&#8217;s role as a go-between for
the Lehman brokerage&#8217;s repurchase agreements with short-term
investors after the parent&#8217;s bankruptcy. Lehman said last year
that JPMorgan failed to sell collateral securing the loans in a
&#8220;commercially reasonable manner.&#8221; JPMorgan said it generated
more than $18 billion of cash from the sale of collateral &#8220;in
some of the most difficult markets in modern times,&#8221; benefiting
Lehman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, New York-based JPMorgan is fighting a lawsuit
by Lehman that alleges the lender helped cause its 2008 collapse
by demanding $8.6 billion in collateral. The settlement approved
yesterday, which means that JPMorgan will return $699 million of
the collateral to Lehman, doesn&#8217;t affect the bank&#8217;s other claims
against the defunct firm, a lawyer for JPMorgan told the judge
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan sued Lehman back after the $8.6 billion suit,
alleging Lehman defrauded its lender into making the loan. It
has asked the judge to dismiss Lehman&#8217;s suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history in
2008, listing $613 billion in debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
08-13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). The lawsuit is Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 10-03266, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Stanford Helped Support Antiguan Banking Reforms, Witness Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R. Allen Stanford underwrote expenses for a blue-ribbon
panel to &#8220;clean up&#8221; Antigua&#8217;s offshore banking sector in 1999,
a lawyer who served on that commission testified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Antigua was getting blasted&#8221; for lax regulation and poor
cooperation with international anti-money-laundering efforts,
which threatened island banks&#8217; ability to do business with U.S.
banks, Patrick O&#8217;Brien, a former U.S. Customs Service agent,
said yesterday at Stanford&#8217;s criminal fraud trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the Federal Reserve won&#8217;t do business with your
country, you&#8217;re out of business,&#8221; he told the jury. &#8220;Allen
Stanford wanted it to be the crown jewel of the Caribbean.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Brien said he and Stanford personally seized the records
of all Antiguan offshore banks over the protests of Althea
Crick, the island&#8217;s top regulator. They loaded the records into
Stanford&#8217;s truck and put them under guard in a Stanford facility
so the commission could &#8220;do its job,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ms. Crick was an obstructionist; we couldn&#8217;t get the
records; we couldn&#8217;t get things done,&#8221; O&#8217;Brien testified. &#8220;We
were basically stonewalled. The only one who could authorize
access was Ms. Crick and she wouldn&#8217;t.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jurors previously heard Crick testify that Stanford tried
to take control of Antigua&#8217;s banking regulatory agency through a
combination of threats and charm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors have told jurors that Stanford bribed Crick&#8217;s
successor, Leroy King, with satchels of cash and Super Bowl
tickets to shield Antigua-based Stanford International Bank Ltd.
from scrutiny by island and international regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford is accused of defrauding investors of more than $7
billion through a Ponzi scheme built on bogus certificates of
deposit at that bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Brien is the first defense witness in Stanford&#8217;s trial,
which is in its fourth week in federal court in Houston. After
he retired from the customs service, O&#8217;Brien worked for
Greenberg Traurig LLP (1153L), a law firm that represented Stanford&#8217;s
businesses. He said he &#8220;did a little bit of work&#8221; for Stanford
before the financier asked him to join the Antiguan banking
reform commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford, 61, denies all wrongdoing. He has been in prison
since being indicted in June 2009 and faces as long as 20 years
in prison if convicted of the most serious charges against him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. Stanford, 09-cr-342, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston). The SEC
case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Stanford
International Bank, 09-cv-298, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of Texas (Dallas). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ex-News Corp. Phone Hacker Approved for Supreme Court Appeal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ex-News Corp. (NWSA) private detective who was jailed in 2007
for intercepting mobile-phone voice mails won permission to
appeal to the U.K. Supreme Court in a dispute over giving
incriminating evidence in civil cases against him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glenn Mulcaire, 41, won the court&#8217;s approval yesterday in
London, according to his lawyer Sarah Webb. The private eye, who
hacked into phone messages for News Corp.&#8217;s News of the World
tabloid, was re-arrested last year as part of a new police probe
involving hundreds of newly identified victims. The appeal
relates to parallel civil lawsuits filed by victims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s clearly a very important matter of law which the
Supreme Court have decided they should rule on,&#8221; Webb, of Payne
Hicks Beach in London, said in a phone interview. A two-day
hearing scheduled to start May 9 could affect how British courts
deal with self-incrimination in lawsuits, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mulcaire and Clive Goodman, a reporter for the News of the
World, pleaded guilty and were jailed for as long as six months
in 2007 for intercepting phone messages for members of Prince Charles&#8217;s staff and five other public figures. Police opened a
new probe a year ago after celebrities&#8217; civil lawsuits revealed
evidence of thousands more potential victims and the involvement
of more News Corp. journalists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mulcaire, whose phone-hacking notes were seized by police
in 2006, has been named in many of the claims filed against News
Corp.&#8217;s U.K. newspaper unit since the scandal erupted again in
2010. The appeal stems from lawsuits by actor Steve Coogan and
Nicola Phillips, a former employee of celebrity publicist Max
Clifford, whose voice mails were intercepted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeal on Feb. 1 upheld a ruling that Mulcaire
must disclose who at the tabloid told him to intercept messages
left for Coogan and Phillips, what information was collected and
to whom he gave it. Mulcaire&#8217;s lawyers argued that by doing so
he would incriminate himself if he&#8217;s charged in the new police
probe. While Coogan has since settled his case, Phillips hasn&#8217;t
and the ruling could affect future cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate phone-hacking suit filed by the Welsh pop
star Charlotte Church, scheduled for a trial starting Feb. 27,
Mulcaire&#8217;s lawyers are seeking to block the press from reporting
on evidence about the private detective&#8217;s activities that could
potentially undermine him in a criminal case. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Citigroup Mortgage Unit to Pay $158.3 Million in Settlement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C)&#8217;s CitiMortgage unit agreed to pay $158.3
million to settle claims tied to its actions in a federal home-
loan insurance program, the Manhattan U.S. Attorney&#8217;s office
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. settled a lawsuit against the Citigroup unit that
alleged more than six years of misconduct in connection with the
Federal Housing Administration Direct Endorsement Program, the
U.S. Attorney&#8217;s office said yesterday in a statement. In the
settlement, CitiMortgage admitted to falsely stating that some
loans were eligible for mortgage insurance through the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development, according to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For far too long, lenders treated HUD&#8217;s insurance of
their mortgages like they were playing with house money,&#8221;
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in the statement.
&#8220;In fact, they were playing with other people&#8217;s money and other
people&#8217;s homes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five banks including Citigroup settled with 49 states on
Feb. 9 to end a probe into abusive foreclosure practices, with
Citigroup agreeing to pay as much as $2.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased to resolve this matter in conjunction with
the National Mortgage Settlement reached last week among the
five largest mortgage servicers and the Department of Justice
and state attorneys general,&#8221; Mark Rodgers, a spokesman for New
York-based Citigroup, said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;As with
the larger mortgage agreement, we have fully provided for this
settlement as of the fourth quarter of 2011.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is  U.S. ex rel. Hunt v. Citigroup Inc., 11-
cv-005473, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Fortis, Former Executives Held Liable for Damages in Court &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortis, now known as Ageas (AGS), and its former executives Jean-
Paul Votron and Gilbert Mittler misled investors about the
bank&#8217;s ability to meet capital requirements for more than a
month in 2008 and are liable for damages, a court ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much Ageas, Votron and Mittler must pay will be
determined in separate proceedings, the district court in the
Dutch city of Utrecht said in a ruling yesterday. Maurice
Lippens, the former chairman of Fortis, can&#8217;t be held personally
liable for misleading investors, according to the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verdict is the first court victory for investors who
lost money in the collapse of Fortis, once Belgium&#8217;s largest
financial-services company. Fortis&#8217;s market value dropped by
8.21 billion euros ($10.8 billion) in the period when the court
said investors were being misled, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It lost an additional 5.39 billion euros on June 26,
2008, when Fortis said it would scrap an interim dividend and
announced a share sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ageas regrets this judgment and will lodge an appeal
against it with a view to protecting the interests of its
stakeholders,&#8221; the insurer, based in Brussels and Utrecht, said
yesterday in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortis will cover any damages its former top executives are
found liable for, according to their 2008 termination
agreements. Ageas is contesting those commitments in a lawsuit
Votron, Mittler and Lippens filed before the Utrecht court,
Greet Poulmans, a spokeswoman for Ageas, said by telephone from
Brussels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pentagon Capital Must Pay SEC $76.8 Million for Abusive Trading &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pentagon Capital Management Plc, a closed U.K. hedge fund,
was told by a judge to pay $76.8 million in a lawsuit filed in
2008 by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over
allegedly abusive mutual fund trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet in Manhattan ruled Feb. 14
that the SEC proved its claim in a 17-day trial last year that
the hedge fund and its chief executive officer, Lewis Chester,
engaged in a fraudulent scheme by making mutual fund trades
after the 4 p.m. close of markets in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The defendants intentionally, and egregiously, violated
the federal securities laws through a scheme of late trading,&#8221;
Sweet wrote in the Feb. 14 decision. &#8220;This scheme was broad-
ranging over the course of several years and in no sense
isolated.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweet ruled that Pentagon Capital and Chester must disgorge
$38.4 million in improper profits on the trades. He imposed the
same amount as an additional civil penalty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are extremely disappointed by the judgment and intend
to appeal,&#8221; Frank Razzano, a lawyer for the defendants, said in
a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweet ruled against the SEC&#8217;s claim that Pentagon Capital
committed fraud by making deceptive, rapid-fire transactions
known as market-timed trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pentagon Capital said in 2008 that it was closing and
returning investors&#8217; money because of the SEC investigation and
civil suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Pentagon
Capital Management Plc, 08-cv-3324, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Litigation Departments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ex-Juror Says She Lied to Be &#8216;More Marketable&#8217; in Tax Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A juror who helped convict four defendants in a 10-year tax
shelter scheme said she lied about her background to make
herself &#8220;more marketable&#8221; to serve on the panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catherine Conrad, who was Juror No. 1 in the trial of Paul
Daugerdas, a former lawyer at the defunct law firm Jenkens 
Gilchrist, and three others, testified in a hearing in Manhattan
federal court yesterday that she failed to disclose that she&#8217;s
an alcoholic and a suspended attorney with numerous arrests for
crimes including shoplifting and driving under the influence of
alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daugerdas and the other defendants convicted in May at the
end of a 10-week trial have asked U.S. District Judge William
Pauley to order a new trial based on Conrad&#8217;s lies and omissions
about her past during jury selection. Pauley ordered her
arrested this morning after she telephoned a judge&#8217;s clerk in
Manhattan federal court to say she wasn&#8217;t going to obey a court
subpoena requiring her to testify yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I know I served and I know I did my civic duty,&#8221; Conrad
told Pauley near the end of her testimony yesterday. &#8220;I know my
disclosures would definitely not have allowed me to serve as a
juror.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pauley is holding a two-day hearing to determine whether to
throw out the convictions and order a new trial. Conrad was
granted immunity for her testimony yesterday, after invoking her
constitutional right not to incriminate herself. Pauley released
Conrad at the end of 3 1/2 hours on the stand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jurors convicted Daugerdas on more than 20 criminal counts,
including conspiracy, multiple counts of tax evasion and
attempting to impede the Internal Revenue Service. He faces more
than 20 years in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defendants claim Conrad wouldn&#8217;t have been permitted to
serve on the jury if she&#8217;d told the truth about her background.
Her presence on the panel deprived them of a fair trial, they
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Daugerdas, 09-CR-581, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) failed to persuade
a federal judge to bar the U.S. and Alaskan governments from
pursuing further damage claims related to the 1989 Exxon Valdez
oil spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge H. Russel Holland in Anchorage
yesterday refused Exxon&#8217;s request to enforce a 1991 agreement,
under which the Irving, Texas-based company paid $900 million to
settle claims over damage to the environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Exxon presently suffers no particular harm,&#8221; Holland
wrote in the order. &#8220;Its business is not in any fashion
disrupted or impeded because of the uncertainty of a claim by
the governments.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Exxon Valdez tanker ran aground in 1989, dumping 11
million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound. Exxon agreed
in 2009 to pay $470 million in interest on a $507.5 million
judgment won by local victims of the spill, including fishermen
and small businesses. That was in addition to the $900 million
civil settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The civil settlement contains a reopener clause that allows
governments to pursue additional damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The possibility of a reopener claim has been &#8216;on the
table&#8217; since the consent decree was finalized,&#8221; Holland wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil from the spill is still trapped between layers of sand
on the Alaskan shoreline, according to a study published in
Nature Geoscience in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is United States of America v. Exxon Corp. 3:91-
cv-0082, U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska
(Anchorage). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), trying to attract
younger Internet users, is bolstering its MSN site with a
service that produces short news synopses based on popular
topics on search and social-media sites such as Twitter Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Called msnNOW, the product scans Twitter, Facebook Inc.,
BreakingNews.com and Microsoft&#8217;s own Bing search engine every
five minutes. MSN&#8217;s staff then create 100-word articles on the
news and post them with related video, news and social-media
posts. Besides a Web version, msnNOW will have be available on
Facebook and mobile devices, MSN General Manager Bob Visse said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web portals such as MSN, Yahoo! Inc. and AOL Inc. have
struggled to hold on to younger users, who increasingly get
their news from social networks. Microsoft is trying to appeal
to more people age 25 to 40 by making it easier to view
information on the day&#8217;s hot topics from multiple sources. MSN
typically attracts older customers and more casual Internet
users, rather than information junkies, Visse said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We skew a little bit older and a little bit lighter usage
than we&#8217;d like,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides leaning heavily on social-networking sources to win
over younger users, msnNOW also is looking to delve into
&#8220;edgier topics,&#8221; Visse said. A demonstration of the product
this week featured a piece on &#8220;butt cleavage.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feature won&#8217;t have advertisements at first, though
Microsoft will add them in the future, he said. In subsequent
versions, the Redmond, Washington-based company also may be able
to respond to users&#8217; behavior by tailoring topics and stories to
their tastes, Visse said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For us to grow in the demographic we want, we have to
show something quite different,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Jeffrey McCracken and Jacqueline Simmons" date="Feb 17, 2012  7:54 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-17/danone-said-to-vie-with-nestle-on-antitrust-plan-for-pfizer-nutrition-unit.html"><headline>Danone, Nestle Said to Have Bid Proposals for Pfizer Unit</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Danone SA (BN) and Nestle SA (NESN), vying to
buy Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s infant-nutrition unit, are working on ways to
overcome antitrust hurdles after submitting preliminary bids of
about $10 billion, said two people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestle is considering buying all of Pfizer&#8217;s infant-
nutrition assets and then conducting an auction to sell what it
can&#8217;t keep because of regulatory concerns it would become too
dominant in some markets, said one of the people, who declined
to be identified because the process is confidential. Danone is
weighing a joint bid with Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. (MJN) and may
split the business along geographies or brands, said the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danone, owner of the Bledina brand formula, and Nestle,
maker of Gerber baby food, may present plans to Pfizer in the
coming weeks, said the people. The companies, two of Europe&#8217;s
biggest foodmakers, are seeking to expand in infant nutrition,
where growth has outpaced other parts of the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either buyer would be asking regulators to approve a deal
after regulatory scrutiny ended some of 2011&#8217;s biggest
transactions. European antitrust authorities stymied Deutsche
Boerse AG (DB1)&#8217;s planned combination with NYSE Euronext, while the
U.S. Department of Justice sued to block ATT Inc.&#8217;s $39 billion
purchase of T-Mobile USA. (DTE) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exploring Options &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, hasn&#8217;t made a
decision on the nutrition business, which had revenue of $2.14
billion last year, said Joan Campion, a spokeswoman for the New
York-based company. Pfizer is in the process of exploring
options for the unit, which include a sale, spinoff or other
transaction, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Nestle declined to comment on the process,
as did a spokeswoman for Paris-based Danone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares declined less than 1 percent to $21.19 at the
close in New York yesterday. The company gained 9.4 percent in
the past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danone said this week its baby-food revenue last year rose
11 percent to 3.67 billion euros ($4.8 billion) on a comparable
basis, helping drive total sales growth. Revenue from Nestle&#8217;s
nutrition business, excluding acquisitions, disposals and
currency shifts, advanced 7.3 percent to 7.2 billion Swiss
francs ($7.9 billion), the company said this week. Infant
nutrition accounted for about 90 percent of the unit&#8217;s sales,
Nestle said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Heinz Interest &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H.J. Heinz (HNZ) Co., as well as other rival food companies and
regional players, may seek to acquire assets from Nestle in
countries where the Vevey, Switzerland-based company could run
into regulatory snags, the people said. While Pittsburgh-based
Heinz had considered bidding for the entire Pfizer unit, it is
now more focused on buying only parts, said one of these people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Heinz declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestle may face antitrust issues in more than a dozen
countries, while Danone would have hurdles in key markets
including the U.K., the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China, where Pfizer generated about 29 percent of its 2010
infant-nutrition revenue, is a country where local regulators
will scrutinize any bid, one person said. China&#8217;s baby-food
market will probably expand by about 17 percent a year from 2010
to 2015, Euromonitor estimated last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying Pfizer&#8217;s business would give Nestle about 10 percent
of the infant milk formula market in China, while a Danone
purchase may create a company with at least a 17 percent share,
according to people with knowledge of the figures. Mead Johnson
would likely have the largest, at about 20 percent or more, the
people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Splitting Brands &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of its plan, Danone may propose that Mead take over
brands such as Pfizer&#8217;s SMA line of products, one of the people
said. Danone may also seek to join with Mead to make it easier
for the company to line up the needed financing and spread the
risk of taking on too much debt. Typically to make a joint bid,
the seller must give approval for bidders to work together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer gained the formula division through its $68 billion
purchase of Wyeth in 2009. The unit, which also makes Enercal
supplements for adults, offers products in more than 60
countries, according to its website, and accounted for 3.2
percent of the company&#8217;s 2011 revenue. Pfizer&#8217;s Campion said the
company expects to announce a decision on the process in 2012
and complete any transaction from July 2012 to July 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is shedding its animal health and nutrition
businesses as part of Chief Executive Officer Ian Read&#8217;s plan to
focus on developing new prescription drugs after losing patent
protection for Lipitor, a cholesterol pill and the world&#8217;s best-
selling medicine. The divestitures are &#8220;on track,&#8221; he said in
a Jan. 31 earnings conference call. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive
officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) since 2006, may step down as
early as the U.S. summer, Fortune Magazine reported today,
citing an unnamed executive at the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary Cohn, president and chief operating officer, is the
board&#8217;s top candidate to replace Blankfein, according to the
report. Blankfein&#8217;s departure isn&#8217;t certain, Fortune wrote.
David Wells, a spokesman for the New York-based firm, declined
to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s 2011 earnings dropped 47 percent to the
lowest level since 2008 on a second consecutive annual decline
in fixed-income trading revenue. Blankfein has sought to repair
the firm&#8217;s reputation after the Securities and Exchange
Commission and a Senate subcommittee accused the company of
misleading buyers of mortgage-linked investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J. Michael Evans, a vice chairman who runs Goldman Sachs
business in growth markets, has tried to position himself to
replace Blankfein, Fortune reported. He hasn&#8217;t won the support
of the board, Fortune said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs shares have jumped 28 percent in 2012 after
plunging 46 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A probe of a JPMorgan Chase  Co.
account that received almost $1.8 billion in inflows of cash in
the month before MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ)&#8217;s bankruptcy showed no
evidence that brokerage customers&#8217; money was being siphoned off,

&lt;p&gt;Louis Freeh, who is handling the parent company&#8217;s

brokerage customer account and the JPMorgan account, held by the
parent company&#8217;s finance affiliate, related to margin loans. The
affiliate lent money to brokerage customers to cover margin
requirements and was later repaid, he said in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freeh said he started the probe, which included &#8220;review of
volumes of bank statements and an extensive population of cash-
transaction activity during October 2011,&#8221; after U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn in Manhattan asked if any cash in
the account belonged to brokerage customers, as some customers
had alleged. His findings indicate that at the JPMorgan account
money flowed from the parent&#8217;s affiliate to the brokerage, and
not the reverse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an investigation, &#8220;the trustee does not believe that
any of the cash in the JPM account as of the petition date
represents misdirected customer property,&#8221; Freeh said in the
report filed yesterday in bankruptcy court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Account Activity &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the account activity from Oct. 26-28, when a shortfall
began in MF Global&#8217;s segregated customer accounts, showed no
misdirected customer cash moving to the account at JPMorgan, he
said. In those two days, $322 million flowed into the finance
unit&#8217;s account and $773 million flowed out, of which $697
million was sent to the brokerage, Free said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global Holdings (MFGLQ), formerly run by ex-Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) co-chairman Jon Corzine, filed the eighth-largest U.S.
bankruptcy on Oct. 31, listing debt of almost $40 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global is using money in the account, which had a
balance of $25.3 million on Oct. 28, while it is in bankruptcy.
The account had about $21 million as of Jan. 31, according to a
monthly operating report filed yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers of the failed brokerage had said the money may
have been part of the $1.2 billion believed at the time to be
missing from their segregated accounts. The brokerage trustee,
James Giddens, has since traced most of the missing money, which
had been added to other sums he hasn&#8217;t immediately been able to
recover. He currently estimates the gap between customer claims
and funds available to pay them at $1.6 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freeh is handling the parent company&#8217;s bankruptcy in a
separate court proceeding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brokerage case is Securities Investor Protection Corp.
v. MF Global Inc., 11-cv-02790, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). The parent&#8217;s bankruptcy case
is MF Global Holdings Ltd., 11-bk-15059, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TransUnion Corp. (TRANSU), a provider of
credit information to banks and consumers, said Advent
International Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s private
equity unit agreed to buy the company from Madison Dearborn
Partners and the Pritzker family in the largest leveraged-buyout
deal this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction, which is expected to be completed by early
in the second quarter, values the company at more than $3
billion, according to a statement today from TransUnion. The
Chicago-based firm had total debt of $1.6 billion last year,
according to public filings, and is preparing to take on $600
million more, according to a Standard  Poor Financial Service&#8217;s
report issued today, valuing the equity component of the
transaction at about $800 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The conversion of cash to plastic is an unstoppable,
global trend and several markets would be well served by a
credit bureau like TransUnion,&#8221; said Philip J. Philliou of New
York-based Philliou Partners, a payments consultant. &#8220;Global
expansion has got to be part of Advent&#8217;s investment thesis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TransUnion&#8217;s owners had initially planned to sell shares in
the company to the public, filing in July of last year to raise
$325 million in an initial public offering, just before the
market rout in the third quarter slowed stock sales. TransUnion
and its biggest competitors, including Equifax Inc. and Experian
Plc, are now coming under scrutiny as state and federal
regulators focus on the practice of providing credit checks to
employers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Heightened Scrutiny &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bobby Mehta, the company&#8217;s chief executive officer, and the
rest of the leadership team will remain with TransUnion,
according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has been criticized by civil rights groups and
the AFL-CIO, the nation&#8217;s largest labor union, who say that
credit checks by employers discriminate against black, Latino
and unemployed applicants. TransUnion, which keeps credit
histories on 500 million consumers and businesses, has led
lobbying against state laws restricting the use of such data,
those groups said in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. has sued companies such as the Washington Post
Co. (WPO)&#8217;s Kaplan Inc. education unit over using credit reports in
hiring and California&#8217;s Democratic Governor Jerry Brown last
year signed a law that limits many employers from engaging in
the practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau yesterday proposed
a regulation that would let it examine the books of such
businesses for the first time. Supervision, the process of
examining records and collecting data from companies, can lead
to enforcement action if regulators find violations of the law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Madison Dearborn &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our proposed rule would mean that those debt collectors
and credit reporting agencies that qualify as larger
participants are subject to the same supervision process that we
apply to the banks,&#8221; Richard Cordray, the bureau&#8217;s director,
said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Created as a rail-car holding company in 1968, TransUnion
began a credit-reporting business and became the first company
to replace physical records with automated tape-to-disc
transfer, according to its website. In 2002, the company
acquired TrueCredit.com to offer credit services directly to
customers online, expanding beyond credit reporting and
business-to-business services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2010, Madison Dearborn, a Chicago-based private
equity firm, acquired a 51 percent stake in TransUnion from the
city&#8217;s Pritzker family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advent International, based in Boston, focuses on
international buyouts, strategic repositioning opportunities and
growth buyouts. Goldman Sachs will be making the investment out
of its $20.3 billion GS Capital Partners VI (PEF3230) Fund LP raised in
2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) advised
TransUnion on the deal. Advent International and GS Capital
Partners were advised by Evercore Partners Inc. and Goldman
Sachs, with Deutsche Bank and affiliates of Goldman Sachs
providing bank and bridge financing commitments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following companies had unusual
price changes in Mexico trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close of trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IPC index fell 0.8 percent to 37,914.70. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO) , the world&#8217;s largest
Spanish-language broadcaster, advanced 2 percent to 54.20 pesos
after Executive Vice President Alfonso de Angoitia said
Televisa&#8217;s content business, which includes advertising, cable
network subscriptions and syndication, will expand 6 percent to
7 percent this year on a conference call today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TV Azteca SAB (AZTECACP) (AZTECACP MM), Mexico&#8217;s second-largest
broadcast television network, fell 2.2 percent to 8.42 pesos. TV
Azteca&#8217;s 2012 sales will grow in the mid-single digit percentage
points, Bruno Rangel, executive director of investor relations,
said today in a conference call, falling short of the average
estimate for a 9.5 percent increase from six analysts, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Crayton Harrison" date="Feb 17, 2012  4:25 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-17/televisa-net-falls-17-on-partner-payouts-for-cable-satellite-expansion.html"><headline>Televisa Net Falls 17% on Partner Payouts for Cable, Satellite Expansion</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO), the world&#8217;s
largest Spanish-language broadcaster, said fourth-quarter profit
fell 17 percent as growth in its pay-TV divisions led to bigger
payouts to partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income declined to 2.17 billion pesos ($169 million)
from 2.62 billion pesos a year earlier, Mexico City-based
Televisa said yesterday in a filing. Sales rose 11 percent to
18.3 billion pesos, beating the 17.9 billion peso average
estimate of five analysts polled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa is using promotions such as free calls to wireless
phones to recruit more cable customers from America Movil SAB (AMXL),
the phone company controlled by billionaire Carlos Slim. The
three cable carriers controlled by Televisa added 61,000 TV
subscribers, 92,000 Internet users and 40,000 voice plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa gained 2 percent to 54.2 pesos at the close in
Mexico City. The shares have dropped 6.7 percent in the past
12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as the company offered promotions to lure customers,
profit margins were little changed in the satellite business
and expanded in the cable unit, helping push operating profit up
16 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pay-TV growth also cut into net income, since Televisa
has to pay out a portion of its profits to DirecTV, which owns
42 percent of its satellite business, and to Grupo Multimedios,
which owns half of its TVI cable unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Higher Payouts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Payouts to such partners rose to 385 million pesos from
94 million pesos a year earlier. A weaker peso and higher
interest payments also hurt net income, pushing financing costs
up 54 percent to 1.08 billion pesos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales in the broadcast division, Televisa&#8217;s largest unit,
climbed 5.1 percent from a year earlier. Sales of advance
advertising for 2012 rose 8.9 percent from a year earlier,
Executive Vice President Alfonso de Angoitia said today on a
conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content business, which includes advertising, cable
network subscriptions and syndication, will expand 6 percent
to 7 percent this year, with an operating profit margin of
47 percent, little changed from 2011, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa&#8217;s satellite-TV unit added 184,000 subscribers for
a total of 4 million in 2011. This year, sales will expand at
a rate in the mid-single-digit percentage points, down from
11 percent in 2011, de Angoitia said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Capital Expenses &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital expenses will reach $850 million, including
$475 million for the cable unit, $250 million for satellite
and $125 million for programming, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Losses in two companies in which Televisa has stakes, U.S.
broadcaster Univision Communications Inc. (UVN) and Spanish TV network
Gestora de Inversiones Audiovisuales La Sexta SA, cut into net
income. Those units combined for 131 million pesos in losses, up
from 23.7 million pesos a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royalties from Univision, which licenses Televisa&#8217;s
programming, will climb 8.9 percent to $245 million this year,
de Angoitia said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Income taxes more than doubled last year to 1.4 billion
pesos as the company&#8217;s tax rate increased from 2010. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner should to be ordered to give a deposition in Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)&#8217;s lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
which alleged the bank siphoned $8.6 billion out of Lehman in
the 2008 credit crisis, helping to cause its collapse, the
defunct firm and its creditors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman has a March 16 deadline for completing its fact
finding in the case, after interviewing more than 200 witnesses,
creditors said in a filing in U.S. District Court in Washington.
Lehman is asking a federal judge to order Geithner to be
interviewed by lawyers for the firm and its creditors. The
Treasury Department &#8220;has for many months delayed and ultimately
refused to allow the testimony of Secretary Timothy F.
Geithner,&#8221; which is key to the case, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The filing, e-mailed to Bloomberg, was confirmed by a
Lehman official who declined to be named. The filing was made in
person, the official said. It couldn&#8217;t be immediately confirmed
in court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geithner, at the time president of the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York, discussed the collateral JPMorgan was demanding for
its loans with Richard Fuld and James Dimon, Lehman&#8217;s and
JPMorgan&#8217;s chief executive officers, in the week before Lehman&#8217;s
bankruptcy, according to the filing. He also met with Dimon and
Henry Paulson, then Treasury Secretary, to discuss &#8220;concerns&#8221;
that Dimon was using the crisis to strengthen his bank at
Lehman&#8217;s expense, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Treasury Refusal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Treasury also has refused to let Paulson testify,
creditors said. They would address the refusal separately, they
said. Lehman&#8217;s official committee of creditors works closely
with the defunct firm on its plans and lawsuits, it has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Secretary Geithner has given public testimony about the
failure of Lehman Brothers on multiple occasions before Congress
and other government bodies,&#8221; said Anthony Coley, a Treasury
Department spokesman, in an e-mail. &#8220;In this particular matter,
Treasury and the Federal Reserve have cooperated extensively
with the plaintiffs. Treasury and the Fed have provided
thousands of pages of documents and arranged for depositions of
numerous other witnesses. We have also offered to provide a
written declaration from the Secretary in order to provide any
additional information that the parties are seeking. Given all
the available information, it is unclear why plaintiffs continue
to insist on unnecessary depositions of current and former
Treasury secretaries.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on Lehman
creditors&#8217; account of Dimon&#8217;s conversations with officials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dispute Settled &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman and JPMorgan this week got a judge&#8217;s approval to
settle a $699 million dispute, with the bank returning that
amount of the $8.6 billion to Lehman. In addition to the
lawsuit, they are fighting over $6.3 billion in claims that the
bank filed against the defunct firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. bank, which lent $70 billion to Lehman&#8217;s
brokerage around the time of the 2008 bankruptcy, sued Lehman
back after the $8.6 billion suit, alleging Lehman defrauded its
lender into making the loan. It has asked a judge to dismiss
Lehman&#8217;s suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history in
2008, listing $613 billion in debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-
13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). The lawsuit is Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 10-03266, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada Pension Plan Investment
Board, the country&#8217;s second-biggest retirement fund, tapped a
veteran investment banker to head its Asia-Pacific unit as it
seeks to increase investments in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Machin, who stepped down as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s
vice-chairman for Asia-Pacific excluding Japan in December, will
become president of CPPIB Asia Inc. effective March 19, the
company said in an e-mailed statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machin, 45, joins Toronto-based Canada Pension as the
retirement plan is expanding its reach into emerging markets
with a focus on Asia and Latin America. The fund had less than 9
percent of its C$152.8 billion ($153.3 billion) in total assets
invested in Asia at the end of December, according to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our expectation is that our investments in Asia-Pacific
will grow disproportionate to the upside of the total fund,&#8221;
said Mark Wiseman, executive vice president at Canada Pension,
in an interview in Hong Kong today. &#8220;We have to be here. I
think we&#8217;re actually behind where we need to be.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada Pension&#8217;s current level of investment in Asia is
&#8220;arguably underweight,&#8221; relative to size of the region&#8217;s
economies, Wiseman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machin, who spent 20 years at Goldman Sachs and ran the New
York-based bank&#8217;s investment bank for six years, will be based
in Hong Kong in his new role, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Record Fundraising &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundraising by private equity firms in Asia rose to a
record $53.8 billion last year, from $43.5 billion a year ago
according to the Asia Venture Capital Association. Canada
Pension has already committed capital to Asia-focused funds run
by Baring Private Equity Asia, Citic Capital, Hony Capital Ltd.,
and MBK Partners Ltd., according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund will invest in local funds and also co-invest with
those funds, Wiseman said. Apart from private equity, Canada
Pension is broadening is investment in real estate and
infrastructure and its primary markets are China, Australia,
India and Japan, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It certainly makes sense for them to be thinking on those
terms,&#8221; William Robson, chief executive officer of C.D. Howe
Institute, a Toronto-based nonpartisan research firm, said in an
interview. &#8220;They do need, increasingly, to move abroad if they
want to escape the cap on growth that Canadian demography
imposes on them and do a little better for the investors in the
fund.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goldman Departures &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machin&#8217;s appointment comes after several senior investment
bankers have left Goldman Sachs for the private equity industry
in Asia. TPG Capital hired former Goldman Sachs managing
director Steve Sun as a partner in China last year, and Permira
Advisers LLP hired Alan Chen, executive director of the bank&#8217;s
Asian Special Situations Group, as head of China, it said in
August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Ong, who was Goldman Sachs&#8217;s co-head of Asia
investment banking with Machin, left in 2008 to join Hopu
Investment Management Co., a fund set up by Fang Fenglei, who
ran Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Chinese securities venture. Ong later
started his own fund called RRJ Capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machin trained as a doctor before joining Goldman Sachs,
where he worked for 20 years until his departure. Canada
Pension, which opened its Asia office in Hong Kong in 2008, has
20 staff based in the city, according to the statement. The fund
may open its second Asian office in India, Wiseman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada Pension also said today it also retained Vikram
Gandhi, a former Credit Suisse Group banker, to advise the fund
on investment opportunities in India. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada Pension covers every Canadian province except
Quebec. Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec, the country&#8217;s
largest pension manager, oversees pensions for retirees in the
French-speaking province. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Kinnucan, the Broadband
Research LLC founder who said he refused to secretly record a
money manager in a U.S. probe of insider trading, was arrested
in Portland, Oregon, the FBI said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Bureau of Investigation agents arrested Kinnucan at
his home yesterday, Elizabeth Steele, an FBI spokeswoman in
Portland, said in an e-mail. Steele said Kinnucan was in the
Multnomah County Jail awaiting his initial appearance today
before a federal judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is no further information that I can give to you at
this point,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Donald, a spokesman in the FBI&#8217;s New York office,
said he expected Kinnucan to be arraigned today in Portland and
eventually be brought to New York to face prosecution. He said
the charges are under seal and he couldn&#8217;t discuss the case
further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least 10 agents wearing FBI jackets arrived at
Kinnucan&#8217;s home at 4:19 p.m. yesterday, said a neighbor, who saw
the arrest and didn&#8217;t want to be identified because she knows
the family. Kinnucan, wearing a T-shirt and blue jeans and with
his arms handcuffed behind his back, was led away from his house
minutes later by the agents, the neighbor said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors in New York previously disclosed in
court papers that they had a court-authorized wiretap on
Kinnucan&#8217;s mobile phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kinnucan, 54, whose public refusal of an FBI request to
wear a wire presaged a dozen insider-trading arrests, said in a
July 8 interview that he expected to be arrested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Am I a target? Yeah, absolutely,&#8221; Kinnucan said in the
interview. &#8220;There&#8217;s a saying that the government indicts who
they investigate, so I have always assumed that I was a
target.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kinnucan, who ran the expert networking firm, denied he
ever received illegal tips on companies, and insisted the kind
of information he provided hedge fund clients was publicly
available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kinnucan&#8217;s calls were recorded in talks with Donald
Longueuil, a former SAC portfolio manager, and Level Global
Investors LP co-founder Anthony Chiasson, said prosecutors in
the office of Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longueuil was sentenced in July to 2 1/2 years in prison
for his role in an insider-trading scheme. Chiasson pleaded not
guilty Feb. 14 to conspiracy and securities-fraud charges in
federal court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probe is the biggest insider-trading investigation in a
generation, one that has implicated hedge funds, technology
firms and expert networking firms such as Broadband Research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 60 people have been charged with insider trading
in the five-year probe called &#8220;Perfect Hedge&#8221; by the FBI in
New York and by Bharara&#8217;s office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathaniel Burney, a New York lawyer who has represented

&lt;h2&gt;Madoff Trustee May Struggle to Undo HSBC Ruling, Lawyers Say &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The liquidator of Bernard Madoff&#8217;s firm asked an appeals
court to reinstate $30 billion of his claims against banks
including HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) and JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff trustee Irving Picard filed arguments in a federal
appeals court in New York on why district judges Jed Rakoff and
Colleen McMahon were wrong in barring him from demanding damages
from the banks, which include UBS AG (UBSN) and UniCredit SpA. (UCG) He is
challenging two similar rulings made on &#8220;solid legal ground,&#8221;
said Peter Henning, a former Securities and Exchange Commission
lawyer who teaches at Wayne State University in Detroit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rakoff in July threw out almost $9 billion in damages that
Picard demanded from HSBC and feeder funds, saying the trustee
can&#8217;t sue on behalf of customers, using common-law claims
against parties who had an alleged duty to detect Madoff&#8217;s
fraud. Picard demanded $19 billion in damages from the con man&#8217;s
banker, JPMorgan, which McMahon also dismissed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The chances are not good for turning around a ruling on a
matter where the court has substantial discretion,&#8221; said
Michael Clark, a lawyer with Duane Morris LLP in Houston who
specializes in financial fraud and has handled appeals. &#8220;He has
to show the court misapplied the law in a way that&#8217;s beyond a
discretion call. Rakoff is a very bright judge, and he sets out
clearly why he&#8217;s ruled.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The district court&#8217;s holding is erroneous,&#8221; Picard said
in his filing in the HSBC case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanda Remus, a Picard spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t respond to an e-
mail seeking comment on the lawyers&#8217; views that overturning the
judges&#8217; rulings would be hard. She has previously said Picard
remains confident of his right to make the claims against the
banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it didn&#8217;t know about the fraud, or in any way
participate in it, and couldn&#8217;t be held responsible for a scheme
orchestrated by Madoff alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC faulted Picard for his theory that the bank had
obligations to all Madoff investors and should have probed the
fraud. HSBC wasn&#8217;t the &#8220;watchman&#8221; for all the con man&#8217;s
investors and didn&#8217;t owe them any duty, a lawyer for the London-
based bank said at a court hearing before Rakoff last year in
Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 73, is serving a 150-year sentence in a federal
prison in North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main case is Securities Investor Protection Corp. v.
Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, 08-ap-1789, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bank Mortgage Probes Will Proceed, New York and Delaware Say &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State and federal officials will aggressively investigate
misconduct in the bundling of mortgages into securities
following a settlement with banks over foreclosure abuses, the
New York and Delaware attorneys general said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $25 billion agreement announced last week was crafted
to allow further probes of banks to proceed by states and
federal agencies, including inquiries into possible criminal
violations, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and
Delaware&#8217;s Beau Biden said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are all committed to pursuing real investigations for
all the areas that we are still able to investigate,
specifically and most importantly on the securitization side,&#8221;
Biden said in an interview. &#8220;You&#8217;re going to see a real effort
on our part and the New York attorney general to pursue the
securitization pieces of this to wherever it takes us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department in January announced the formation
of a joint state-federal group that will investigate misconduct
that led to the financial crisis through the bundling of
mortgage loans into securities sold to investors. The group is
led by officials from the Justice Department, the Securities and
Exchange Commission and Schneiderman&#8217;s office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group will share resources and information,
Schneiderman said in a remarks yesterday at a breakfast
sponsored by Crain&#8217;s New York Business. Schneiderman and Biden
have been cooperating in an investigation of bank mortgage
practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $25 billion settlement reached with Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America Corp., New York-based JPMorgan
Chase  Co., New York-based Citigroup Inc. (C), San Francisco-based
Wells Fargo  Co. and Detroit-based Ally Financial Inc (ALLY). will
provide mortgage relief to homeowners and sets requirements for
how the banks conduct foreclosure and service loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks in return were granted liability releases
protecting them from certain claims. Biden and Schneiderman said
the releases are narrowly tailored to allow further
investigations of bank practices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bank of America Seeks to Block CEO Deposition in MBIA Suit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. asked a New York state judge to block
the deposition of Chief Executive Officer Brian T. Moynihan in a
fraud lawsuit brought by MBIA Inc. (MBI), a court filing showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nation&#8217;s second-biggest lender, based in Charlotte,
North Carolina, asked New York state Supreme Court Justice
Eileen Bransten in Manhattan to issue a protective order against
the deposition, according to a proposed order to show cause
filed Feb. 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have moved for a protective order because a chief
executive officer of a major corporation may only be deposed
when he or she has unique information that is not available
through other means.&#8221; Bank of America spokesman Lawrence
Grayson said yesterday in a statement. &#8220;The discovery process
remains fully available to MBIA, including through the numerous
current and former executives that MBIA will be deposing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed order to show cause asks Bransten to order
MBIA to explain why a protective order against the deposition
shouldn&#8217;t be issued. The motion for the protective order wasn&#8217;t
immediately available in court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MBIA, which sued Countrywide in 2008, guarantees payments
to investors that bought securities backed by pools of the
lender&#8217;s loans. The insurer says the loans were riskier than
Countrywide promised, and as they defaulted, the Armonk, New
York-based company was forced to make payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Sushon, an attorney at O&#8217;Melveny  Myers LLP who
filed the proposed order to show cause, didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to messages seeking further comment. Manisha M. Sheth,
an attorney with Quinn Emanuel Urquhart  Sullivan LLP who is
representing MBIA, didn&#8217;t immediately return a telephone message
left at her office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is MBIA Insurance Corp. v. Countrywide Home Loans
Inc., 602825-2008, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exxon Valdez Judge Refuses to Rule Against More Damage Claims &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) failed to persuade a federal judge to bar
the U.S. and Alaskan governments from pursuing further damage
claims related to the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge H. Russel Holland in Anchorage refused
Feb. 15 Exxon&#8217;s request to enforce a 1991 agreement under which
the Irving, Texas-based company paid $900 million to settle
claims over damage to the environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Exxon presently suffers no particular harm,&#8221; Holland
wrote in the order. &#8220;Its business is not in any fashion
disrupted or impeded because of the uncertainty of a claim by
the governments.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Exxon Valdez tanker ran aground in 1989, dumping 11
million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound. Exxon agreed
in 2009 to pay $470 million in interest on a $507.5 million
judgment won by local victims of the spill, including fishermen
and small businesses. That was in addition to the $900 million
civil settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The civil settlement contains a reopener clause that allows
governments to pursue additional damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The possibility of a reopener claim has been &#8216;on the
table&#8217; since the consent decree was finalized,&#8221; Holland wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil from the spill is still trapped between layers of sand
on the Alaskan shoreline, according to a study published in
Nature Geoscience in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is United States of America v. Exxon Corp. 3:91-
cv-0082, U.S. District Court, District of Alaska (Anchorage). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BTA Bank Ex-Chairman Gets 22 Months in Prison for Contempt &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mukhtar Ablyazov, the former chairman of Kazakhstan&#8217;s BTA
Bank, was sentenced to 22 months in a U.K. jail for breaching a
court-ordered freeze on his assets and lying under oath in a $5
billion fraud lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The violations were &#8220;deliberate and brazen&#8221; and require
that Ablyazov be placed in immediate custody, Judge Nigel Teare
said yesterday in London. Ablyazov, who fled to Britain to
escape prosecution in his home country, failed to appear at the
hearing. BTA&#8217;s lawyer said the ex-banker may be fleeing again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Ablyazov has lied to his own lawyers and lied to this
court,&#8221; Stephen Smith, a BTA lawyer, said before the
sentencing. &#8220;He has had plenty of opportunities to tell us the
truth and has continually evaded doing so.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTA, the biggest Kazakh lender before defaulting on $12
billion of debt in 2009, filed a series of civil suits against
Ablyazov and ex-Chief Executive Officer Roman Solodchenko
claiming they took more than $5 billion from the Almaty-based
bank using fake loans, back-dated documents and offshore
companies. Both men have denied the claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for BTA, which restructured its debt after being
nationalized, said Ablyazov violated a 2009 court order by
failing to reveal all his assets, including a house in the
British countryside and a London mansion, each valued at 20
million pounds ($31.6 million), two apartments in the U.K.
capital worth 1 million pounds each, and an offshore firm that
allegedly carried out a $300 million fraud against the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ablyazov&#8217;s lawyer, Duncan Matthews, said he didn&#8217;t know his
client was planning to skip the hearing and there&#8217;s no reason to
believe he&#8217;s fleeing the country. Teare denied his request to
delay sentencing so he could advise Ablyazov on &#8220;the
consequences of his course of action.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The judgment should serve as a signal to Mr. Ablyazov&#8217;s
associates that the full force of the law will be pursued to
ensure court orders are obeyed,&#8221; Nikolay Varenko, a deputy
chairman at the bank, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A call to Ablyazov&#8217;s spokesman, Locksley Ryan of RLF
Partnership Ltd. in London, wasn&#8217;t answered and an e-mail didn&#8217;t
receive an immediate response. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;U.K. FSA Arrests Legal  General Employee in Trading Probe &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Legal  General Investment Management Ltd. employee was
arrested in London and three premises were searched as part of
the U.K. markets regulator&#8217;s highest-profile insider-trading
investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man was released on bail after he was interviewed under
caution at a London police station, the Financial Services
Authority said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. The FSA and
the Serious Organized Crime Agency searched an office and home
in London and a residence in Kent, an area southeast of the
British capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A 44-year-old man employed by Legal  General Investment
Management was arrested on 16 February and released on bail
pending further enquiries,&#8221; the company said in an e-mailed
statement. &#8220;We are not aware of any detriment caused to
customers or any impact on our financial results.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case relates to an insider-trading investigation where
employees from Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Exane BNP Paribas and Moore
Capital Management LLC were arrested in March 2010. Those
questioned include Julian Rifat of Moore Capital, Deutsche
Bank&#8217;s Martyn Dodgson, Exane&#8217;s Clive Roberts, Novum Securities
Ltd.&#8217;s Graeme Shelley and Iraj Parvizi, a director at Aria
Capital Ltd. No one has been charged in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSA conducted further searches in April 2011 and
arrested someone at the time, the regulator said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency is probing whether the men used knowledge of
upcoming securities sales to engage in the front running of
block trades, generally on behalf of a corporate client, to
generate a profit for themselves. The case is codenamed
Tabernula, Latin for &#8220;little tavern.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Stanford Operations Run by CFO Davis, Not Boss, Manager Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R. Allen Stanford left daily operating decisions to his
finance chief, who volunteered to &#8220;lay himself off&#8221; for a
$650,000 lump-sum payout as regulators were closing in on the
company in February 2009, a former manager testified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We were in the midst of a crisis, and I told him it would
look strange if we lay off our global CFO,&#8221; Joan Stack, former
global human resources manager at Stanford Financial Group, said
she told finance chief James M. Davis. &#8220;He was the person I
felt made the day-to-day decisions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis replied that he would &#8220;stay behind the scenes&#8221; and
continue running the firm, Stack told jurors yesterday in
federal court in Houston at Stanford&#8217;s criminal fraud trial. In
exchange for appearing to step aside, Davis asked for an upfront
payment of 65 percent of his 2009 salary, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis made this proposal &#8220;at a very fast-moving time&#8221;
when &#8220;cash flow problems&#8221; were causing Stanford&#8217;s firm to
cancel 2008 year-end bonuses and lay off half its employees,
Stack testified. &#8220;We were trying to get to a point where costs
would be reduced to the point the organization would survive,&#8221;
Stack said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jurors previously heard Davis testify that Stanford was the
mastermind and prime beneficiary of an alleged $7 billion
investment fraud centered on what the government claims were
bogus certificates of deposit at Antigua-based Stanford
International Bank Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors accuse Stanford of skimming more than $2
billion of investor deposits to finance an extravagant lifestyle
and risky ventures ranging from Caribbean airlines and real
estate development to cricket tournaments. Investors were told
their funds were kept in safe, liquid assets rather than
speculative ventures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis pleaded guilty to his role in the alleged scheme and
testified as a government witness in the trial, now in its
fourth week. &#8220;Follow the money,&#8221; Davis told jurors, pointing
across the courtroom at Stanford. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford, 61, denies wrongdoing in connection with the
alleged investment fraud. If convicted of the most serious
charges against him, he faces as long as 20 years in prison. He
has been jailed as a flight risk since being indicted in June
2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. Stanford, 09-cr-00342, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston). The SEC
case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Stanford
International Bank, 09-cv-00298, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of Texas (Dallas). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Merger Suits Often Mean Cash for Lawyers, Zero for Investors &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A shareholder lawyer told a Delaware judge at a midsummer
court hearing two years ago that his team deserved $700,000 for
work on a lawsuit in which his clients received nothing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholders of BJ Services Co., an oilfield-services
company now owned by Baker Hughes Inc., claimed its sale to the
former parent would undervalue their holdings. The settlement of
the case gave investors &#8220;crucial&#8221; data such as performance
projections for five more years, Shane T. Rowley of Faruqi 
Faruqi LLP told the judge, seeking to justify the legal fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I can&#8217;t think of fruit that&#8217;s closer to the ground,&#8221;
Chancery Court Judge John W. Noble responded. Still, the judge
awarded Rowley and his colleagues $500,000 for their efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scenarios like the one played out at the July 2010 hearing
in Wilmington are common in the Delaware court, the chief U.S.
venue for mergers and acquisitions suits, Bloomberg News&#8217; Ann
Woolner, Phil Milford and Rodney Yap report. Of 57 such investor
class actions settled or otherwise concluded there in 2010 and
2011, 40 -- or 70 percent -- made money for plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers
but not clients, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The greatest benefit is for the plaintiffs&#8217; attorneys&#8221;
in such litigation, said John C. Coffee Jr., a Columbia
University professor who teaches securities law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the 10 cases that New York-based Faruqi  Faruqi
helped to settle during the two years produced cash for clients,
according to court records. Legal fees in those 10 cases totaled
$6 million, split among plaintiffs&#8217; firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, lawyers won $32.4 million for themselves in the 40
cases that generated no money for clients. The lowest legal fee
award was $150,000; the highest was $4 million. The median came
to $512,500, according to the data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 17 MA lawsuits that resulted in cash for clients
produced $350 million for the shareholders. The largest, a Del
Monte Foods Inc. case, gave plaintiffs $89.4 million. Of that
amount, attorneys were paid $22.3 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even without consistent monetary awards, such lawsuits let
shareholders scrutinize transactions and gain changes in terms,
according to defenders of MA litigation. Deal-makers, knowing
their work will be closely evaluated by lawyers, produce fairer,
more transparent transactions as a result, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;policing&#8221; effects of litigation have &#8220;real value,&#8221;
Bernard Black, a Northwestern University law and finance
professor who co-wrote an academic study of the Delaware courts,
said. That &#8220;might well justify the money we throw at
plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;R.J. Reynolds, Philip Morris Win Federal Jury Trial in Florida &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altria Group Inc. (MO)&#8217;s Philip Morris USA and R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co. won a defense verdict in a wrongful-death case filed
by the widow of a smoker who died of lung cancer, Altria said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A jury in federal court in Jacksonville, Florida, returned
the verdict for the companies yesterday on the first day of
deliberations, Altria said in a statement. The trial was the
first federal trial of thousands of so-called &#8220;Engle&#8221; tobacco
injury claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virginia Gollihue claimed her husband, Manuel Gollihue,
died from lung cancer at age 53 after smoking at least two packs
a day of the defendants&#8217; cigarettes for almost 38 years. His
illness and death were caused by his addiction to nicotine,
Virginia Gollihue claimed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gollihue&#8217;s suit was the first individual claim by a smoker
tried in a Florida federal court after the state&#8217;s supreme court
in 2006 threw out a $145 billion punitive-damage verdict against
the industry and ended a class action filed on behalf of Florida
smokers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling, which permitted smokers in the class to sue
individually, is known as the &#8220;Engle&#8221; decision, after Howard
Engle, the lead plaintiff in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, smokers have won 40 of the 58 Engle verdicts in
state court trials, according to Edward L. Sweda Jr., senior
attorney for the Tobacco Products Liability Project, which
tracks the suits. Trials in federal court have been delayed by
pretrial appeals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Feb. 13, Philip Morris faced 3,306 Engle cases in
Florida state courts and 3,238 in federal courts, according to
an Altria Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Reynolds is
a defendant in 6,561 cases in state and federal courts combined,
it said in an SEC filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury deliberated for 47 minutes before delivering its
verdict, according to Stephanie Parker, a partner with the Jones
Day (1113L) law firm who represented Reynolds in the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate case yesterday, a jury in Oregon state court
issued a $25 million verdict against Philip Morris in a lawsuit
by the family of a woman who smoked low-tar cigarettes and died
of lung cancer in 1999, said Chuck Tauman, the family&#8217;s
attorney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Gollihue v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 09-
CV-10530, U.S. District Court, Middle District of Florida
(Jacksonville). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JJ&#8217;s Risperdal Wasn&#8217;t Factor in Man&#8217;s Diabetes, Jury Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson  Johnson&#8217;s anti-psychotic drug Risperdal wasn&#8217;t a
substantial factor in causing a Nebraska man&#8217;s diabetes, even
though JJ failed to give an adequate warning to his doctor
about the drug&#8217;s risks, a New Jersey jury ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jurors in state court in New Brunswick, where JJ is based,
found by a 5-1 vote that the company didn&#8217;t adequately warn the
doctor for Gary Skala of the risk of diabetes. Because they
ruled 5-1 against Skala, 56, on the causation question, they
didn&#8217;t award him any damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skala&#8217;s lawsuit was the first of more than 400 personal-
injury lawsuits over Risperdal to go to trial. JJ lawyers said
the company properly warned of the drug&#8217;s risks after its
introduction in 1994. They said Skala was an obese &#8220;couch
potato&#8221; whose disease was caused by his weight, his heavy
drinking, his sedentary lifestyle and other risks, not
Risperdal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The label was adequate, and the information was there,&#8221;
JJ attorney Jeffrey Peck told jurors Feb. 15 in his closing
argument. &#8220;Doctors used the medicine because it worked. In this
case, Dr. Skala&#8217;s doctors prescribed it and it saved his life.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An attorney for Skala, Fletch Trammell, argued to jurors
that Risperdal was a &#8220;substantial contributing factor&#8221; in his
diabetes by helping to cause his obesity. While the drug may
have helped his mental illness, Trammell said, JJ&#8217;s Janssen
unit failed to warn Skala&#8217;s doctor of the diabetes risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trammell said he was disappointed with the verdict, which
he called a &#8220;Pyrrhic victory.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teresa Mueller, a spokeswoman for JJ, the world&#8217;s second-
biggest health-products company, said in an e-mail: &#8220;We are
pleased with the jury&#8217;s decision to reject the plaintiff&#8217;s
claims. Since the early 1990s, Risperdal has improved the lives
of countless people throughout the world who suffer from
debilitating mental illnesses.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Jersey case is Skala v. Johnson  Johnson (JNJ), MID-
L-6820-06 (MT), Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division,
Middlesex County (New Brunswick). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Motorola Solutions&#8217; $200 Million Accord Tentatively Approved &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Solutions Inc. (MSI) and a group of investors who sued a
corporate predecessor claiming it misled them about the
company&#8217;s prospects in 2006 won a U.S. judge&#8217;s tentative
approval of a $200 million settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Amy St. Eve yesterday preliminarily
signed off on the proposed agreement after hearing from the
parties&#8217; lawyers at the federal courthouse in Chicago. She will
consider a motion for final approval on May 9, after class
members have had an opportunity to file objections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an August 2007 complaint, Motorola Inc. (MMI)&#8217;s then-Chief
Executive Officer Edward Zander and other executives were
accused of overstating the prospects of the company and its
mobile phone-making unit in the second half of 2006. By 2007,
Motorola was the world&#8217;s third-biggest mobile phone maker, down
from second-biggest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Solutions and lawyers for the stockholders
announced the settlement agreement on Feb. 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lead plaintiffs in the case are the Macomb County
Employees&#8217; Retirement System and the St. Clair Shores Police 
Fire Pension System, both of Michigan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department on Feb. 13 approved Motorola
Mobility&#8217;s acquisition by Google Inc. (GOOG) for $12.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Silverman v. Motorola Inc., 07-cv-4507, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Producers of &#8220;Spider-Man: Turn Off
the Dark&#8221; said they will pay full royalties to the show&#8217;s
former director, Julie Taymor, three months after she sued for
back pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement is part of a settlement with the Stage
Directors and Choreographers Society, the union which filed an
arbitration on Taymor&#8217;s behalf. Producers of the $75 million
musical continue to battle in a separate copyright lawsuit in
federal court over Taymor&#8217;s role in writing the book of the
musical and whether she&#8217;s owed money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laura Penn, executive director of the society, said she&#8217;s
hopeful there will be a settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Julie should be making great theater and not in
litigation,&#8221; she said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penn declined to disclose the total royalties owed. Taymor
wasn&#8217;t available for comment, said a spokesman, Chris Kanarick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taymor sued producers in November, claiming that they
refused to pay royalties guaranteed by her contract and violated
her intellectual-property rights by changing the show without
her permission. As the co-writer, she said she worked on the
script for more than seven years. Producers countersued last
month in federal court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show formally opened on June 14 after 182 previews.
Last week, its eight performances grossed $1.4 million, behind
only &#8220;Wicked&#8221; and &#8220;The Book of Mormon,&#8221; according to the
Broadway League, a trade group, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remaining copyright case is Julie Taymor v. 8 Legged
Productions LLC, 1:11-cv-08002-RJH, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;EU Court Won&#8217;t Require Filter System for Social-Networking Site &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Justice of the European Union ruled yesterday
that social-networking sites cannot be forced to install
filtering systems to protect against the unauthorized sharing of
files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case involved SABAM, a Belgian company that represents
authors, composers and publishers of musical works and
authorizes the use of those works by third parties. Netlog NV is
a social-networking company that, according to SABAM, allows the
unauthorized sharing of music and videos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the court recognized the importance of protecting
intellectual property rights, imposing a filtering system would
improperly require social-networking sites &#8220;to actively monitor
almost all the data relating to all of its service users in
order to prevent any future infringement of intellectual
property rights,&#8221; according to the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It follows that an injunction would require the hosting
service provider to carry out general monitoring,&#8221; which is
prohibited by EU law, the court found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court also held that &#8220;such an injunction would result
in a serious infringement of the freedom of the hosting service
provider to conduct its business&#8221; and said that such a system
would impinge on users&#8217; right to &#8220;protection of their personal
data and their freedom to receive or impart information.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Belgische Vereniging van Auteurs, Componisten
en Uitgevers(SABAM) v Netlog NV, C-360/10. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pfizer, Mylan Settle With Sanofi Over Allergic-Reaction Device &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mylan Inc. (MYL) and a unit of Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, settled patent litigation with France&#8217;s Sanofi (SAN) over a
device used to treat severe allergic reactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanofi may start selling the device, the Intelliject
epinephrine e-cue auto injector, beginning Nov. 15, according to
the settlement with Pfizer&#8217;s Meridian Medical Technologies,
Mylan and Pfizer said in a statement yesterday. The sales are
contingent upon final approval from the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased with this settlement,&#8221; said Mylan Chief
Executive Officer Heather Bresch. &#8220;In addition to our
significant efforts in this area, people with&#160;life-threatening
allergic reactions&#160;will benefit from more voices in the fight&#8221;
against such reactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial lawsuit was filed in January 2011 in federal
court in Wilmington, Delaware, by Meridian, which makes the
EpiPen, alleging the Intelliject product would infringe a U.S.
patent. Further terms of the settlement weren&#8217;t released. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mylan is based in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, and Pfizer is

&lt;h2&gt;Intellectual Ventures Sues ATT, Sprint and T-Mobile &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intellectual Ventures, the firm controlled by former
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Technology Officer Nathan Myhrvold, sued
ATT Inc. (T)&#8217;s ATT Mobility division, Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) and T-
Mobile USA Inc. for infringement of 15 patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closely held Intellectual Ventures, founded by Myhrvold
after he left Microsoft in 2000, owns more than 35,000 patents
and has earned more than $2 billion in licensing fees, according
to the complaint filed yesterday in federal court in Wilmington,
Delaware. The suit is the company&#8217;s eighth against several high-
tech companies, including Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ), Canon Inc. (7751) and
Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Siegel, an ATT spokesman; Anna Friedges, a T-Mobile
spokeswoman; and Stephanie Vinge-Walsh, a spokeswoman at Sprint
Nextel, all declined to comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melissa Finocchio, Intellectual Ventures&#8217; chief litigation
counsel, said in a statement on the company&#8217;s website that it
&#8220;previously attempted to discuss licensing options with each of
these companies, but none were responsive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon Wireless wasn&#8217;t sued because it is already a
licensee of the firm&#8217;s patents, said Naomi Zeitlin, a
spokeswoman for the Bellevue, Washington-based Intellectual
Ventures. She declined to say whether Verizon licensed the
specific patents at issue in the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myhrvold is a columnist for Bloomberg View, which is owned
by Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Intellectual Ventures I LLC v. ATT Mobility
LLC, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apple Gets Partial Win Against Motorola Mobility in Germany &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL) won a partial victory in a patent case against
Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. over mobile-device technology in
Germany. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Munich Regional Court granted an injunction against
Motorola Mobility mobile phones that use methods for unlocking
touch screens protected by a European patent owned by Apple,
company spokesman Alan Hely said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of Apple&#8217;s case was dismissed, said Marcus Grosch,
Motorola Mobility&#8217;s German lawyer. The court ruled that Motorola
Mobility Xoom tablets don&#8217;t violate Apple&#8217;s patent, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s ruling is Apple&#8217;s first win in Germany after
Motorola Mobility won two out of three rulings in suits it filed
against Apple in a Mannheim court. The world&#8217;s most valuable
technology company was forced to briefly remove some older
iPhone and iPad models from its online store in Germany earlier
this month when Motorola Mobility sought to enforce its first
win from December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility &#8220;has implemented a new design for the
feature,&#8221; the company said yesterday in an e-mailed statement.
&#8220;Therefore, we expect no impact on current supply or future
sales.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European and U.S. antitrust regulators this week approved
Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s $12.5 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility.
The deal arms Google with patents to protect its Android
operating system, used by smartphones and tablets from companies
including Motorola Mobility that compete with Apple&#8217;s products.
The regulators warned they will continue to watch how the
companies use patents in litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Munich case centered on Apple&#8217;s European patent
EP1964022B1, which protects a method for unlocking a device in
which the user swipes his finger across an image. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is LG Muenchen, 7 O 11395/11, 7 O 19692/11. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apple Wins Hong Kong Ruling, Aiding China IPad Trademark Fight &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. can use some documents filed previously by
Proview International Holdings Ltd. (334) in the Hong Kong courts,
aiding the iPad maker&#8217;s efforts in a trademark dispute over the
tablet computer&#8217;s name in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple&#8217;s application to use four documents filed by Proview
in a case that started in 2010 was granted by Master A. Ho in a
hearing today. Ho rejected another application by Apple to use
documents submitted in the future by Proview, saying he couldn&#8217;t
issue such a &#8220;blanket&#8221; order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawyer representing Apple said the company wants the
documents as it prepares to appeal a November ruling by a
Chinese court that Proview&#8217;s Shenzhen subsidiary owns the iPad
trademark in the nation. Since that ruling by the Shenzhen
Intermediate People&#8217;s Court, Proview asked China&#8217;s customs
bureau to stop imports and exports of the iPad, and asked local
retailers to stop selling the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawyer for Apple told the court that the documents
sought by the Cupertino, California-based company contained
details of correspondence between Proview officials. The lawyer
wasn&#8217;t required to identify herself during the hearing and
declined to give her name when approached by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple was represented by the law firm Baker  McKenzie at
the hearing, according to Hong Kong court information. Proview
wasn&#8217;t represented at today&#8217;s hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple started litigation against Proview over the iPad
trademark in Hong Kong and China in 2010. In June 2011, a Hong
Kong court granted Apple&#8217;s application for an injunction
preventing Proview from selling the iPad trademark to others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple said this week it acquired Proview&#8217;s worldwide rights
to the iPad trademark in 10 countries, including China. Proview
is refusing to honor an agreement with Apple in China, Apple
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roger Xie, a lawyer for Proview at the Grandall Law Firm in
Shenzhen, didn&#8217;t respond to a phone call seeking comment. The
Higher People&#8217;s Court of Guangdong will hear Apple&#8217;s appeal on
Feb. 29. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;UBS Claims Two Ex-Advisers Took Customer Data to Wells Fargo &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A UBS AG (UBSN) brokerage unit sued two former financial advisers
in Chicago, claiming they took confidential trade secret
information including customer account data to competitor Wells
Fargo (WFC) Advisers LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Named as defendants in the lawsuit filed Feb. 15 by UBS
Financial Services Inc. are David Kinnear and Kathleen Bakas,
who allegedly resigned two days earlier to join the Wells Fargo
 Co. unit. One full-time and one part-time UBS employee, all
part of Kinnear&#8217;s wealth-management group, went with them,
according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Led by Kinnear, the team serviced accounts that generated
more than $3.7 million in revenues for UBS over the past 12
months of the defendants&#8217; employment,&#8221; UBS alleged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based brokerage unit of Zurich-based UBS seeks
a court order blocking the defendants and any Wells Fargo
representative from soliciting any UBS client Kinnear or Bakas
had advised while there, preventing the disclosure of any
proprietary UBS information and directing its return. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS also seeks expedited arbitration of its claims through
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ancel Martinez, a spokesman for San Francisco-based Wells
Fargo, which isn&#8217;t a party to the suit, couldn&#8217;t immediately
comment on the case. Kinnear and Bakas didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to e-mail messages seeking comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is UBS Financial Services Inc. v. Kinnear,
12CH05333, Cook County, Illinois, Circuit Court, Chancery
Division (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MacAndrews  Forbes, Drapkin Reach Post-Verdict Settlement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ronald Perelman&#8217;s MacAndrews  Forbes Holdings Inc. and
Donald Drapkin settled their remaining claims against each other
after Perelman&#8217;s ex-lieutenant won $16 million at a trial in
January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All disputes between Donald Drapkin and MacAndrews 
Forbes are resolved,&#8221; David Dunn, a lawyer for Drapkin, said in
a telephone interview. The terms of the agreement are
confidential, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two sides filed papers in Manhattan federal court
yesterday dismissing the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A jury deliberated for 90 minutes last month before
returning a verdict for Drapkin in his breach-of-contract suit
against MacAndrews  Forbes, which he left in 2007. The
agreement means the court won&#8217;t consider any remaining disputes
between the parties, including Drapkin&#8217;s claim for attorneys&#8217;
fees and MacAndrews  Forbes&#8217;s planned request to have the
verdict thrown out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Kobre, a lawyer for MacAndrews  Forbes, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a message seeking comment on the settlement.
MacAndrews  Forbes had also claimed that Drapkin tried to
induce another employee to leave and had failed to turn over
company documents. Drapkin had denied those charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Drapkin v. Mafco Consolidated Group, 09-
cv-1285, and MacAndrews  Forbes LLC v. Drapkin, 09-cv-4513,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

Moore" date="Feb 17, 2012 12:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-17/morgan-stanley-goldman-move-away-from-mark-to-market-on-loan-commitments.html"><headline>Morgan Stanley, Goldman Move Away From Mark-to-Market on Loan Commitments</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley increased its use of
historical cost accounting for corporate loan commitments,
joining Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) in moving away from the mark-
to-market approach the firms had earlier used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley raised the amount of loans and lending
commitments that it accounted for as &#8220;held for investment,&#8221; or
HFI, to $9.7 billion in the fourth quarter from $800 million a
year earlier. Goldman Sachs decided to make the change to some
of its corporate loan book, the Wall Street Journal reported
yesterday, citing people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both New York-based firms had losses on relationship
lending last year and face differing treatment from regulators
between HFI and fair-value commitments. Fair-value accounting
often requires firms to book losses on the commitments, even if
they aren&#8217;t tapped by the borrowers, while commercial bank
competitors avoid mark-to-market declines by holding the
commitments at historical cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are still fanatical believers in mark-to-market,&#8221;
Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said on a
conference call with analysts last month. &#8220;Substantially all of
our assets today are mark-to-market. Our risk is managed on a
mark-to-market basis. And whatever we conclude on what I&#8217;ll call
a very small portion of assets, just relationship lending, those
statements will still be true.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) had about $400 million of losses in the
third quarter from corporate lending, the majority of which is
unfunded commitments. Goldman Sachs had $1 billion in unrealized
losses related to relationship lending for 2011. Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to comment on
whether the firm made a decision on the accounting treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Onerous&#8217; Treatment &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consideration of the change was also being driven by &#8220;more
onerous capital treatment&#8221; of mark-to-market commitments
compared to similar HFI assets, Viniar said. Fair-value loans
&#8220;were penalized substantially more than HFI loans,&#8221; in the
Federal Reserve&#8217;s annual review of banks&#8217; capital plans, Morgan
Stanley CFO Ruth Porat said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley is working to increase lending as it gains
more deposits through buying Citigroup&#8217;s remaining stake in the
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney brokerage, which had $110.6 billion
in deposits as of Dec. 31. Total corporate loans and commitments
rose to $82.9 billion at the end of 2011 from $69.1 billion a
year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Fundamentally, we are a mark-to-market shop,&#8221; Porat said
last month. &#8220;As it relates to the loan book, we obviously have
a bank. We&#8217;re the fifteenth-largest U.S. depository by deposits,
and so we&#8217;re always considering what makes sense in terms of
capital and funding efficiency.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commercial banks helped fight off a proposal last year from
the Financial Accounting Standards Board that sought to make
them mark loans to market. The panel sets U.S. accounting
standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs told Norwalk, Connecticut-based FASB during
the comment period for that proposal that banks hide losses on
loans used to generate investment-banking fees and should be
required to report the loans at fair value. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walter Schloss, the money manager
who earned accolades from Warren Buffett for the steady returns
he achieved by applying lessons learned directly from the father
of value investing, Benjamin Graham, has died. He was 95. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He died on Feb. 19 at his home in Manhattan, according to
his son, Edwin. The cause was leukemia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1955 to 2002, by Schloss&#8217;s estimate, his investments
returned 16 percent annually on average after fees, compared
with 10 percent for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. (SPX) His firm,
Walter J. Schloss Associates, became a partnership, Walter 
Edwin Schloss Associates, when his son joined him in 1973.
Schloss retired in 2002. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett, a Graham disciple whose stewardship of Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. has made him one of the world&#8217;s richest men and
most emulated investors, called Schloss a &#8220;superinvestor&#8221; in a
1984 speech at Columbia Business School. He again saluted
Schloss as &#8220;one of the good guys of Wall Street&#8221; in his 2006
letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Walter Schloss was a very close friend for 61 years,&#8221;
Buffett (BRK/A) said yesterday in a statement. &#8220;He had an extraordinary
investment record, but even more important, he set an example
for integrity in investment management. Walter never made a dime
off of his investors unless they themselves made significant
money. He charged no fixed fee at all and merely shared in their
profits. His fiduciary sense was every bit the equal of his
investment skills.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Began as &#8216;Runner&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Buffett, Schloss&#8217;s record disproved the theory of an
efficient market -- one that, at any given moment, assigns a
reasonably accurate price to a stock. If companies weren&#8217;t
routinely overvalued and undervalued, Buffett reasoned, long-term results like Schloss&#8217;s couldn&#8217;t be achieved, except through
inside information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schloss, who never attended college, began working on Wall
Street in 1935 as a securities-delivery &#8220;runner&#8221; at Carl M.
Loeb  Co. He said Armand Erpf, the partner in charge of the
statistical department, recommended that he read &#8220;Security
Analysis&#8221; by Graham and David Dodd, published a year earlier.
The book became a classic in the field. The firm then paid for
Schloss to take two courses with Graham sponsored by the New
York Stock Exchange Institute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schloss stayed in touch with Graham while serving four
years in the U.S. Army during World War II, then went to work
for Graham before striking out on his own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Schloss theory of investing, passed from father to son,
involved minimal contact with analysts and company management
and maximum scrutiny of financial statements, with particular
attention to footnotes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Focus on Statements &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Schlosses would rather trust their own analysis and
their longstanding commitment to buying cheap stocks,&#8221; Bruce
Greenwald, Judd Kahn, Paul Sonkin and Michael van Biema wrote in
&#8220;Value Investing: From Graham to Buffett and Beyond,&#8221; their
2001 book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This approach,&#8221; the authors wrote, &#8220;leads them to focus
almost exclusively on the published financial statements that
public firms must produce each quarter. They start by looking at
the balance sheet. Can they buy the company for less than the
value of the assets, net of all debt? If so, the stock is a
candidate for purchase.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example was copper company Asarco Inc. The Schlosses
bought shares in 1999 as the stock bottomed out around $13. In
November of that year, Grupo Mexico SA (GMEXICOB) bought Asarco for $2.25
billion in cash and assumed debt, paying almost $30 a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Guts to Buy&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Basically we like to buy stocks which we feel are
undervalued, and then we have to have the guts to buy more when
they go down,&#8221; Schloss said at a 1998 conference sponsored by
Grant&#8217;s Interest Rate Observer. &#8220;And that&#8217;s really the history
of Ben Graham.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett, in his 2006 letter to shareholders, said Schloss
took &#8220;no real risk, defined as permanent loss of capital&#8221; and
invested &#8220;in about 1,000 securities, mostly of a lackluster
type. A few big winners did not account for his success.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edwin Schloss, now retired, said yesterday in an interview
that his father&#8217;s investing philosophy and longevity were
probably related. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A lot of money managers today worry about quarterly
comparisons in earnings,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They&#8217;re up biting their
fingernails until 5 in the morning. My dad never worried about
quarterly comparisons. He slept well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter Jerome Schloss was born on Aug. 28, 1916, in New
York City, the son of Jerome H. Schloss and the former Evelyn
Gomprecht, according to a paid notice in the New York Times. He
attended the Franklin School in Manhattan, now part of the
Dwight School. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Early Lessons &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schloss learned lessons about earning and saving from his
father, whose radio factory warehouse burned down before a
single unit was sold, and from his mother, who lost her family
inheritance in the 1929 market crash, Alice Schroeder wrote in
her 2009 book, &#8220;The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business
of Life.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He enlisted in the Army on Dec. 8, 1941, the day after
Japan&#8217;s surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, and rose to the rank of
second lieutenant. He served in Iran as part of the Signal
Corps, then moved to the Pentagon in Washington to complete his
tours of duty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this period, he stayed in touch with Graham, who was
looking for a securities analyst just as Schloss was finishing
up his wartime service. Schloss joined Graham-Newman in 1946. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schloss first met Buffett at an annual meeting of
wholesaler Marshall Wells, which drew both investors because it
was trading at a discount to net working capital, according to a
2008 article in Forbes magazine. When Buffett joined Graham-Newman, he and Schloss shared an office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Buffett became a star inside the firm, Schloss was
&#8220;pigeonholed as a journeyman employee who would never rise to
partnership,&#8221; Schroeder, a Bloomberg News columnist, wrote in
her book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schloss left Graham-Newman in 1955 and, with $100,000 from
an initial 19 investors, began buying stocks on his own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His wife, Louise, died in 2000. They also had a daughter,
Stephanie. In 2001, Schloss married the former Ann Pearson. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) plans to
increase its first sale of Samurai bonds in more than four years
to at least 75 billion yen ($943 million) from an original
target of 50 billion yen, according to a person with direct
knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brokerage will offer at least 70 billion yen of five-
year notes priced to yield 205 basis points more than the yen
swap rate, the person said, asking not to be identified because
the details are private. Goldman also intends to sell at least 5
billion yen of five-year, floating-rate notes at 220 basis
points more than the three-month London interbank offered rate
for yen, said the person. The bonds could price as soon as
tomorrow, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Goldman Sachs delayed the sale last week
after Moody&#8217;s Investors Service placed it under review for
downgrade, another person familiar with the matter said at the
time. The bank last sold Samurai bonds in January 2008, when it
raised 148.5 billion yen, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I thought the spreads would be tighter than this,&#8221;
Yoshihiro Nakatani, a Tokyo-based senior fund manager at Asahi
Life Asset Management Co., said in a phone interview today.
&#8220;The five-year maturity of the fixed-rate bonds is a
disadvantage for investors, given their price volatility.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Record Start &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs initially marketed the fixed-rate notes to
yield 170 basis points to 195 basis points more than the yen
swap rate before price guidance was raised to a 195 basis point
to 210 basis point spread, the person said on Feb. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiroko Matsumoto, a spokeswoman at Goldman Sachs in Tokyo,
declined to comment on the sale when contacted by telephone
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217; sale would make 2012 the busiest start to
the year on record for yen-denominated notes issued by overseas
companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V), the world&#8217;s biggest
electronic payments network, plans to increase the volume of
transactions in Kenya by more than 30 percent this year,
according to Victor Ndlovu, country manager for East Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of transactions increased 26 percent to almost 5
billion shillings ($60.2 million) last year, Ndlovu said in an
interview on Feb. 17 in Nairobi, the capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are obviously trying to grow that much more because of
our presence and what we think we are going to be doing in the
market,&#8221; Ndlovu said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company opened a regional office in Nairobi in December
that is responsible for operations in about 20 English-speaking
countries in sub-Saharan Africa, he said. Most of the growth in
Kenya, east Africa&#8217;s biggest economy, is from retail outlets,
travel and entertainment industries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa has almost doubled the number of branded credit cards
in Kenya to 4.1 million at the end of September from 2.7 million
a year earlier, Ndlovu said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd. (CCL), Australia&#8217;s
biggest soft-drink maker, posted a 54 percent rise in second-
half profit as a one-time gain from selling its beer unit to
SABMiller Plc (SAB) outweighed the effect of stalling domestic demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income rose to A$438.2 million ($467 million) in the
six months ended Dec. 31 from A$284.6 million a year earlier.
Second-half figures were calculated by subtracting first-half
earnings from the A$591.8 million full-year profit the Sydney-
based company reported today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooler summer weather in Australia&#8217;s eastern states
combined with stalling consumer spending to crimp sales in the
company&#8217;s biggest market. The result was helped by a A$170.3
million gain from the sale of Coca-Cola Amatil&#8217;s stake in the
Pacific Beverages beer business to SABMiller, and it may
exercise an option to buy spirit assets from the London-based
brewer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Considering the weather it&#8217;s a pretty consistent
performance,&#8221; David Cooke, an analyst at Nomura Holdings Ltd.
in Sydney, said by phone yesterday. &#8220;A quality company like
this should be able to deliver high single-digit or low double-
digit earnings growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full-year profit of A$591.8 million beat the A$573
million average of nine analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excluding items, profit for 2011 rose 5 percent to A$532
million, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Most Challenging &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past 12 months were &#8220;undoubtedly the most challenging
year the business has faced in over a decade,&#8221; Chief Executive
Officer Terry Davis said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Amatil shares fell 0.3 percent to A$12.08 at
12:02 p.m. in Sydney. The benchmark SP/ASX 200 index declined
0.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company agreed in December to sell its stake in the
Pacific Beverages beer venture for A$305 million to clear the
way for SABMiller to complete its A$10.5 billion acquisition of
Foster&#8217;s Group Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Amatil said it expects to spend as much as A$200
million by the middle of this year if it exercises a related
option to buy Foster&#8217;s spirits and pre-mixed drinks business
from SABMiller. It would aim to return to the local beer
business as soon as a two-year exclusion period under its
agreement with SABMiller lapses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While in the short term we may not be able to compete in
beer in Australia, we are not restricted in our other markets,&#8221;
Davis said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Australian Slowdown &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annual earnings before interest and tax from Australian
beverages rose 2.4 percent from a year earlier to A$607.2
million as the cooler weather curbed demand before Christmas.
The pace of growth slowed from 7.3 percent in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia  Papua New Guinea profit jumped 18 percent to
A$88.1 million while earnings from New Zealand  Fiji slipped
2.3 percent to A$80 million. Earnings from the Alcohol, Food 
Services unit fell 1.2 percent to A$93.2 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One-time items added A$59.8 million to annual profit, with
the gain from the Pacific Beverages sale partially offset by
A$110.5 million in restructuring costs in its food business as
it fired employees and wrote down the value of inventory. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy Inc. (WLT), the U.S. mining
company that paid C$5.3 billion ($5.3 billion) for Western Coal
Corp. in April, posted fourth-quarter earnings that missed
analysts&#8217; estimates after metallurgical-coal prices fell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income dropped 8.8 percent to $83.8 million, or $1.34 a
share, from $91.9 million, or $1.72, a year earlier, Birmingham,
Alabama-based Walter said today in a statement. The average
estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for profit of
$1.50 a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of metallurgical coal, which is used in steelmaking,
rose 60 percent to 2.4 million tons. The average selling price
for hard coking coal was $244 a metric ton. The company&#8217;s so-
called average cash cost of production climbed to $131.74 a ton
from $91.14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Average realized pricing was a little lower than we were
looking for and average costs were a little higher,&#8221; Jim Rollyson, a Houston-based analyst with Raymond James Financial
Inc., said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter reiterated its guidance of 11.5 million to 13
million tons of coal production in 2012. It sold 8.7 million
tons in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter rose 1.7 percent to $66.64 in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) attempted to counter
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s allegations that it sidestepped privacy
settings in the Internet Explorer Web browser by saying that the
policies in question are &#8220;widely non-operational.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft had said in a blog post yesterday that Google is
circumventing certain privacy settings and tracking users of the
Internet Explorer browser with so-called cookies, which keep
tabs on what people do on the Web. The tool cited by Microsoft
asks websites to disclose information about their privacy
practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is impractical to comply with Microsoft&#8217;s request
while providing modern Web functionality,&#8221; Google said in an e-
mailed statement. &#8220;Today the Microsoft policy is widely non-
operational.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 11,000 websites were not providing the
information as requested by Microsoft, Google said, citing
research from 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, owner of the world&#8217;s largest search engine, is
grappling with concerns from privacy groups and government
officials around the world over how it uses information about
Web surfers. A Stanford University study released last week said
Google violated users&#8217; privacy on Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s Safari browser
through its DoubleClick ad network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In yesterday&#8217;s blog post, Microsoft said its Internet
Explorer browser blocks third-party software called cookies,
unless a site presents a recognized policy statement indicating
how the site will use the cookie and will avoid user tracking.
The &#8220;P3P&#8221; policy statement is derived from a Web standards
body. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google bypasses this &#8220;P3P&#8221; privacy setting in Microsoft
browsers, Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said. The
company&#8217;s new Internet Explorer 9 has an additional privacy
feature that is not susceptible to this type of bypass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, thousands of websites are not using P3P standards
requested by Microsoft, according to a report by Carnegie Mellon
University that was cited in the Google statement. Google, based
in Mountain View, California, said Microsoft began using the
protocol in its browser in 2002. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IPC index fell 0.5 percent to 38,096.95. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genomma Lab Internacional SAB (LABB) , the Mexican

pesos. The company said it plans to acquire all shares of
Prestige Brands Holdings Inc. for $16.60 per share, valuing the

Prestige&#8217;s closing price on Feb. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO) , the world&#8217;s largest

The positive impact on cable and telecom profit margins from

&lt;p&gt;Nigeria (OPCANIGE), Africa&#8217;s biggest crude

Mobil Corp. (XOM) will be renewed tomorrow as it concludes a review of
expired or soon to lapse leases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will be signing off on the renewals of the three
joint-venture leases operated by Mobil Producing Co. of
Nigeria,&#8221; Petroleum Minister Diezani Alison-Madueke said today
in the capital Abuja. &#8220;We expect that all others will follow.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil leases 67, 68 and 70, which together produce 580,000
barrels of crude a day, were nullified by the minister in March,
Lagos-based ThisDay reported in May. Negotiations for 16 oil
blocks operated by companies including Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch
Shell Plc and Chevron Corp. have been under way for two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The West African country will present a draft bill for the
regulation of the country&#8217;s oil industry to the parliament
within six weeks, Alison-Madueke said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigeria is the fifth-biggest source of U.S. crude imports.
Shell, Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Total SA and Eni SpA (ENI) operate joint

&lt;p&gt;A former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
computer programmer was freed after his conviction for stealing
the bank&#8217;s high-speed trading code was reversed by a U.S.
appeals court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wearing a gray sweatsuit, white tennis shoes and a huge
grin, Sergey Aleynikov, 42, left the Manhattan courthouse where
he had been convicted in December 2010 and entered a waiting car
with his lawyer, Kevin Marino. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Justice occasionally works,&#8221; Aleynikov told reporters as
he left. &#8220;This was such big news to me I haven&#8217;t had any time
to think about what would happen.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Russia, said
he hoped to be with his three daughters, ages 8, 6 and 3. Until
Feb. 17, he had been serving an eight-year sentence at the
federal prison in Fort Dix, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hearing oral arguments from both prosecutors and
Marino on Feb. 16, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Manhattan issued
a one-page order vacating Aleynikov&#8217;s convictions for economic
espionage and the interstate transportation of stolen property.
The appeals court said it would issue an opinion explaining the
ruling later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court also issued a mandate that would have
foreclosed any further challenge to its decision. The office of
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara persuaded the court to set
aside the mandate so it can argue for a rehearing of the appeal,
either before a three-judge panel or all the court&#8217;s available
judges. Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for Bharara&#8217;s office,
declined to comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Denise Cote, who presided over the
trial, ordered Aleynikov released from prison Feb. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov was convicted by a jury of violating the Economic
Espionage Act and the Interstate Transportation of Stolen
Property Act. He was sentenced last March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On his last day of work at New York-based Goldman Sachs in
June 2009, Aleynikov uploaded hundreds of thousands of lines of
source code from the firm&#8217;s high-frequency trading system,
prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He circumvented Goldman Sachs&#8217;s security, sent the code to
a server in Germany, compressed and encrypted it, and took it
with him to a meeting with new employers in Chicago, the U.S.
said. Prosecutors argued Aleynikov wanted it as a &#8220;cheat
sheet&#8221; to start a trading system at his new job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During oral arguments on Feb. 16, the three-judge appeals
panel criticized the government&#8217;s application of the espionage
act to Aleynikov&#8217;s actions, asking the prosecutor how the crime
occurred and how it affected commerce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judges -- Dennis Jacobs, 67, Guido Calabresi, 79, and
Rosemary Pooler, 73 -- also asked if taking Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
trading code was comparable to taking copyrighted material or
bringing an employee manual to a new job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Aleynikov, 1:10-cr-00096, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stanford CFO Allegedly Forged Boss&#8217;s Name, Refused Reforms &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R. Allen Stanford was furious to learn that his finance
chief, James Davis, forged his name to a 2007 employee memo
abolishing a department Stanford created to &#8220;reel in&#8221;
expenses, a former executive testified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He called me at home at 11 or 12 one evening, and he was
very mad,&#8221; Linda Wingfield, Stanford&#8217;s former executive
director of special projects, told jurors Feb. 17 at Stanford&#8217;s
criminal fraud trial in federal court in Houston. &#8220;He said he
did not sign it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wingfield, who held a number of executive positions at
Stanford&#8217;s companies over 10 years, testified that Davis refused
to give the boss access to a corporate computer system with
Stanford Financial Group Co.&#8217;s financial records. Testifying as
a defense witness, she said Davis also ignored or circumvented
policies Stanford instituted to clamp down on expenditures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He fought us from day one, a department set up by the
chairman to try to control costs,&#8221; Wingfield said of Davis.
&#8220;Mr. Davis was always refusing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wingfield&#8217;s testimony may bolster Stanford&#8217;s claim that it
was Davis, not he, who ran the financial services empire and
engineered a fraud that cost investors more than $7 billion.
Davis pleaded guilty and testified as a government witness
earlier in the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors accuse Stanford of stealing more than $2
billion from certificates of deposit at his Antigua-based
Stanford International Bank Ltd. Instead of holding investor
funds in safe assets as he promised, Stanford used their money
to fund an extravagant lifestyle and risky ventures including
Caribbean airlines, real estate projects and cricket
tournaments, prosecutors say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford, 61, has been jailed as a flight risk since being
indicted in June 2009. If convicted of the most serious charges,
he faces as long as 20 years in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wingfield, who also ran some of Stanford&#8217;s side ventures,
testified Feb. 17 via a video link from federal court in
Orlando, Florida. She said she was too ill to travel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Scardino, Stanford&#8217;s lawyer, asked Wingfield who
controlled &#8220;all the financial issues, including the treasury,
accounting, internal audits and investments&#8221; at Stanford&#8217;s
companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Davis -- and the insurance, too,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There
was nobody else who handled all the books.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wingfield told jurors she believed Stanford&#8217;s court-
appointed receiver duplicated efforts and wasted money during
the &#8220;chaotic&#8221; period after the businesses were seized by the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in February 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 40 Stanford investors crowded into the courtroom
Feb.17 to mark the third anniversary of the SEC crackdown. Angie
Shaw, leader of the Stanford Victims&#8217; Coalition, said the
group&#8217;s motto is &#8220;3 and $0,&#8221; meaning &#8220;three years and zero
recovery&#8221; by defrauded investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. Stanford, 09-cr-342, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston). The SEC
case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Stanford
International Bank, 09-cv-298, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of Texas (Dallas). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Commerzbank Defends Bonus Cut After Bank Fell Off &#8216;Cliff&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commerzbank AG (CBK) didn&#8217;t act dishonestly in going back on a
promise to pay bankers from a guaranteed bonus pool, the German
lender&#8217;s attorney said in a London trial over payments to
Dresdner Kleinwort staff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commerzbank, which took over Dresdner in 2009 and cut
bonuses by 90 percent or more, is defending a lawsuit brought by
104 Dresdner bankers who want individual payouts of as much as 2
million euros ($2.7 million). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stefan Jentzsch, Dresdner&#8217;s former chief executive officer,
had promised at a 2008 company meeting to set aside 400 million
euros for discretionary pay. Dresdner&#8217;s record loss that year
justified changing the policy and Jentzsch&#8217;s pledge wasn&#8217;t
legally binding, Commerzbank lawyer Thomas Linden said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It may be perfectly honorable to withdraw from a non-
binding commitment in circumstances when the business has fallen
off a cliff,&#8221; Linden told the judge in closing arguments
yesterday. &#8220;Every banker, we say, in the U.K. knows that until
you have a document which sets out the award, you don&#8217;t have an
entitlement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European banks face pressure from governments and
regulators over pay. Executives at Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) and
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc should have to give up bonuses
so individuals aren&#8217;t rewarded for failure, the U.K. Treasury
said, while European financial services chief Michel Barnier has
called for new curbs on excessive compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case &#8220;comes at a time when the words &#8216;banker&#8217;s bonus&#8217;
are perhaps not the most popular in the English language,&#8221;
Andrew Hochhauser, a lawyer representing some of the Dresdner
claimants, said in his closing arguments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the 2008 bonus pool promise had been agreed
with then-owners Allianz SE (ALV) in consultation with the U.K.
Financial Services Authority as a way to stop staff leaving
Dresdner, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vermont Attorney General Appeals Ruling on Yankee Nuclear Plant &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state of Vermont filed an appeal of a federal court
ruling allowing Entergy Corp. (ETR) to keep its Vermont Yankee nuclear
power plant open. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Sorrell, the state&#8217;s attorney general, said a Jan.
19 ruling by U.S. District Judge Garvan Murtha &#8220;improperly
limits&#8221; the state&#8217;s role in deciding whether the nuclear power
plant stays open past March 21. The appeal was filed Feb. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Murtha said in his ruling last month that Vermont lacked
the authority to deny Entergy a license to operate the reactor
after March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entergy sued Sorrell, Vermont Governor Peter Shumlin and
members of its Public Service Board in April 2011. Entergy
claimed that the state didn&#8217;t have the authority to overrule the
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which renewed Entergy&#8217;s
license to operate the power station until 2032. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has said in court papers that Vermont Yankee,
the state&#8217;s only nuclear power plant, supplies about 33 percent
of Vermont&#8217;s electricity. It pays about $13 million a year in
state fees and taxes. The plant is in Vernon, on the Connecticut
River in the southeastern corner of the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Orleans-based Entergy is the second-largest operator of
U.S. nuclear plants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee v. Shumlin,
1:11-00099, U.S. District Court, District of Vermont
(Brattleboro). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeal will be heard by the Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New York Can Enforce Ban Against Use of Schools for Worship &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York City can enforce a ban on the use of public
schools for worship services, a U.S. appeals court said,
restricting a judge&#8217;s temporary halt on the ban to only the
group that brought the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The district court&#8217;s finding that Bronx Household has
shown likelihood of success on the merits of its case does not
justify enjoining the board from enforcing its order against
non-parties,&#8221; the appellate court in Manhattan said Feb. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska on Feb. 16 granted a 10-
day temporary order blocking the city&#8217;s ban. The Bronx Household
of Faith had sought the order to allow its members to continue
meeting in a New York City public school on Sundays, in
contravention of an order that went into effect Feb. 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the appellate court, overturning Preska&#8217;s 2007
decision in favor of the church, ruled that the city may
prohibit religious groups from using school facilities outside
of regular school hours for &#8220;religious worship services.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legal battle dates to 1995, when the Bronx Household of
Faith, an evangelical Christian church, sued the city. The
church argued the city was violating the First Amendment by
denying it use of a school while allowing other community groups
access to campuses for their activities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court in December refused to consider the
appeals court&#8217;s ruling reversing Preska&#8217;s decision. Lawyers for
the church returned to argue before Preska that the city&#8217;s ban
violates the First Amendment&#8217;s free exercise clause, which
forbids government interference in religious activities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jordan Lorence, a lawyer with the Alliance Defense Fund in
Washington who represents the Bronx Household of Faith, said in
a phone interview the appeals court&#8217;s order didn&#8217;t deal with the
merits of the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s somewhat disappointing but it&#8217;s not a major
ruling,&#8221; Lorence said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is The Bronx Household of Faith v. Board of
Education of the City of New York, 01-cv-08598, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ex-SanDisk Employee Pleads Guilty in Kinnucan Insider Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former SanDisk Corp. (SNDK) executive Donald Barnetson pleaded
guilty to participating in a securities fraud scheme with John
Kinnucan, an expert networking consultant who was also charged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnetson, 37, pleaded guilty in federal court in Manhattan
Feb. 17 to one count of conspiracy to commit securities and wire
fraud. He faces as long as five years in prison and was ordered
released on $50,000 bond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I conspired with a consultant to provide confidential
information with regard to my employer at the time, SanDisk
Corp.,&#8221; Barnetson told U.S. Magistrate Judge Gabriel Gorenstein
in the hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnetson, a former senior director of original equipment
manufacture strategy for SanDisk, passed tips to Kinnucan who
shared them with his clients, which included hedge funds and
money managers, according to Barnetson&#8217;s plea agreement with the
government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors claim Barnetson tipped Kinnucan in July 2010
about SanDisk&#8217;s anticipated revenue, which wasn&#8217;t public. In
September 2010, he told Kinnucan about confidential negotiations
about a legal dispute between SanDisk and Apple Inc., according
to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kinnucan paid Barnetson with a $25,000 investment in a
business he was starting, as well as meals at expensive
restaurants and food deliveries, according to the Kinnucan
complaint. Kinnucan also gave Barnetson inside information about
other companies, according to prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kinnucan, 54, the Broadband Research LLC founder who said
he refused to secretly record a money manager in a nationwide
U.S. probe of insider trading, was charged with one count of
conspiracy to commit securities fraud, one count of conspiracy
to commit wire fraud and two counts of securities fraud in the
complaint unsealed Feb. 17 in federal court in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was arrested at his home in Portland, Oregon, Feb. 16
the Federal Bureau of Investigation said. Elizabeth Steele, an
FBI spokeswoman in Portland, said Kinnucan was in the Multnomah
County Jail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee Flanagin, a spokesman for Milpitas, California-based
SanDisk, said Barnetson left the company in early 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. Kinnucan, 12-mj-00424, and the
civil case is SEC v. Kinnucan, 12-cv-01230, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;SEC Submits Revised Koss Settlement After Earlier Rejection &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission submitted a
revised settlement of a lawsuit against stereo headphone maker
Koss Corp. (KOSS) and its chief executive officer after a judge
rejected an earlier one as too vague. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC sued Milwaukee-based Koss in October, claiming it
had filed &#8220;materially inaccurate&#8221; financial statements from
2005 to 2009. The agency said the failure of Michael J. Koss,
who was CEO and chief financial officer, to supervise his
accounting staff enabled another executive to embezzle $30
million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC on Feb. 16 submitted a new settlement to U.S.
District Judge Rudolph T. Randa in Milwaukee after his rejection
of a prior one in December. As in the earlier one, the new
agreement requires the CEO to forfeit $450,000 and 160,000
options and to cooperate with the SEC. Neither the company nor
the Koss will admit or deny the SEC&#8217;s claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There was no substantive difference&#8221; between the two
settlements, SEC lawyer Andrea Wood said Friday in a telephone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After rejecting the earlier proposal, Randa in December
asked the SEC to explain how it calculated the amount that Koss
would pay. SEC lawyers said the sum was equal to bonuses and
incentive pay that he received for the fiscal years 2008 and
2009 and part of 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Randa said on Feb. 1 that the SEC&#8217;s response &#8220;largely&#8221;
satisfied his concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Berkeley, a partner in Pittsburgh-based KL Gates LLP (1142L)
who is representing the company and the CEO, didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to a voice-mail message seeking comment on the revised
settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sujata Sachdeva, a former Koss finance executive, pleaded
guilty in 2010 to embezzling more than $30 million. She was
sentenced to 11 years in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v. Koss
Corp., 11-cv-00991, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Wisconsin (Milwaukee). The criminal case is U.S. v. Sachdeva,
10-cr-00006, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Wisconsin
(Milwaukee). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MOEX Agrees to Pay $90 Million to Settle U.S. Spill Claims &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitsui  Co. (8031)&#8217;s MOEX Offshore 2007 LLC will pay $90 million
to the U.S. and five states for violating the Clean Water Act in
the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, according to court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. filed a consent order in federal court Feb. 17
outlining the settlement. The agreement requires MOEX to pay $45
million in civil penalties to the U.S. and about $25 million
total to Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas,
court papers show. MOEX will also pay $20 million for land
acquisition projects, the U.S. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MOEX held a 10 percent share of BP Plc (BP/)&#8217;s Macondo well,
which blew up in April 2010, setting off the largest offshore
oil spill in U.S. history. The company earlier paid BP about $1
billion to settle claims. The U.S. has also sued BP and Anadarko
Petroleum Corp., which held a 25 percent interest in the well,
over Clean Water Act violations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement is the first of a series of expected
agreements with the U.S. as lawsuits over the 2010 spill
approach a trial set for Feb. 27. The U.S. Justice Department
sued MOEX, BP, Anadarko and Transocean Ltd. (RIG), which owned the rig
that exploded, in December 2010, seeking fines for each barrel
of oil discharged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MOEX settlement doesn&#8217;t affect claims against or
potential recoveries from other companies over the spill, the
Justice Department said Feb. 17. MOEX no longer owns a share of
the lease, the U.S. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Macondo well blowout and the explosion that followed
killed 11 workers. The sinking of Transocean&#8217;s Deepwater Horizon
drilling rig and subsequent spill led to hundreds of lawsuits
against London-based BP and its partners and contractors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier in New Orleans, who&#8217;s
overseeing much of the spill litigation, has scheduled a nonjury
trial for Feb. 27 to determine liability and apportion fault for
the disaster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MOEX said in the consent decree that it wasn&#8217;t admitting
any liability under the Clean Water Act. The settlement also
wasn&#8217;t &#8220;an admission by the MOEX entities of any liability for
civil payments or any other claim out of or relating to the
Deepwater Horizon incident,&#8221; according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government case is U.S. v. BP Exploration  Production
Inc., 2:10-cv-04536, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Louisiana (New Orleans). The lawsuit is part of In Re Oil Spill
by the Oil Rig Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico on April
20, 2010, MDL-2179, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Louisiana (New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Facebook Wins Lawsuit Against Power Ventures Over Login Data &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc. (FB), operator of the world&#8217;s largest social-
networking site, won a 2008 lawsuit accusing Power Ventures
Inc.&#8217;s Power.com of accessing and storing users&#8217; login data
without authorization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling Feb. 16 by U.S. District Judge James Ware paves
the way for hearings on damages for Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The undisputed facts establish that defendants
circumvented technical barriers&#8221; to access Facebook&#8217;s site,
Ware wrote in a 19-page opinion issued without a trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook sued Power Ventures in December 2008 in federal
court in San Jose, California, saying Power.com offered users
the ability to retrieve their Facebook messages and other
information from Facebook&#8217;s computer servers without permission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook, based in Menlo Park, California, accused
Power.com of infringing its copyrights and trademarks and
violating computer fraud and unfair competition laws. It sought
a court order prohibiting further access and unspecific damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power Ventures is based in the Cayman Islands, according to
court papers. Power.com is up for sale on the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased that the court ruled in our favor,&#8221; Craig
Clark, lead litigation counsel for Facebook, said in an e-mailed
statement. &#8220;We will continue to enforce our rights against bad
actors who attempt to circumvent Facebook&#8217;s privacy and security
protections and spam people.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Facebook has established a dangerous precedent for the
future of users&#8217; rights to own and control their data,&#8221; said
Steven Vachani, chief executive officer of Power Ventures, in an
e-mailed statement. &#8220;We intend to aggressively continue this
fight.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Facebook Inc. v. Power Ventures Inc., 08-
cv-5780, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
(San Jose). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New Suits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BNY Accused of $1.5 Billion Fraud in Amended U.S. Complaint &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of New York Mellon Corp., the world&#8217;s largest custody
bank, defrauded clients of more than $1.5 billion through
foreign-exchange trades, according to a new complaint by the
U.S. government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank &#8220;repeatedly lied&#8221; about a service for foreign
currency transactions and defrauded clients, including pension
funds and federally insured financial institutions, of more than
$1.5 billion, the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office in Manhattan said in an
amended complaint. It was filed Feb. 16, according to the
office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government&#8217;s lawsuit is one of several brought against
the bank, including one by New York Attorney General Eric
Schneiderman, alleging it defrauded clients through its so-
called standing instruction foreign-exchange service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Standing instruction was so much more profitable to BNYM
than any other foreign exchange service because it relied on a
fraudulent business model,&#8221; U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in
the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first complaint filed in October, the U.S.
Attorney&#8217;s Office said the bank defrauded clients of &#8220;hundreds
of millions of dollars.&#8221; Part of the lawsuit was resolved under
an agreement approved last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As we have said before regarding this lawsuit, we believe
it is without merit, and we will defend ourselves in court,&#8221;
said Kevin Heine, a Bank of New York spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK), 11-6969,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Harbinger Capital, Falcone Sued Over LightSquared Investment &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge fund manager Phil Falcone and his Harbinger Capital
Partners were sued by a New York woman who claims she and others
were misled about the fund&#8217;s decision to put most of the money
they invested into LightSquared Inc. (SKYT) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lili Schad, a Wallkill, New York, resident who said she
invested $4 million with Harbinger, claims she wasn&#8217;t told that
more than 60 percent of the partnership&#8217;s money went into
LightSquared, a company attempting to build a high-speed
wireless network, according to a complaint filed Feb. 17 in
federal court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schad, who seeks to represent all the limited partners in
Harbinger Capital Partners Fund I LP, also claims she wasn&#8217;t
informed that LightSquared&#8217;s plan to build the network faced
obstacles from U.S. regulators. The suit seeks unspecified
damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Had plaintiff known that defendants would concentrate the
fund&#8217;s investments in LightSquared or known of the regulatory
obstacles the company faced, she would have refrained from
investing in the fund or immediately sought to withdraw her
investment from the fund,&#8221; Schad said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schad alleged that Harbinger allowed some &#8220;favored
investors,&#8221; including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., to redeem their
investments on terms unavailable to others. She said that in
2009 Harbinger let Goldman Sachs redeem a $50 million investment
in the fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lew Phelps, an outside spokesman for Harbinger Capital,
didn&#8217;t immediately return a phone message seeking comment on the
suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Schad v. Harbinger Capital Partners LLC, 12-
CV-1244, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Geithner Should Testify in JPMorgan Suit, Lehman Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner should to be
ordered to give a deposition in Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)&#8217;s
lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), which alleged the bank
siphoned $8.6 billion out of Lehman in the 2008 credit crisis,
helping to cause its collapse, the defunct firm and its
creditors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman has a March 16 deadline for completing its fact
finding in the case, after interviewing more than 200 witnesses,
creditors said in a filing in U.S. District Court in Washington.
Lehman is asking a federal judge to order Geithner to be
interviewed by lawyers for the firm and its creditors. The
Treasury Department &#8220;has for many months delayed and ultimately
refused to allow the testimony of Secretary Timothy F.
Geithner,&#8221; which is key to the case, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The filing, e-mailed to Bloomberg, was confirmed by a
Lehman official who declined to be named. The filing was made in
person, the official said. It couldn&#8217;t be immediately confirmed
in court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geithner, at the time president of the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York, discussed the collateral JPMorgan was demanding for
its loans with Richard Fuld and James Dimon, Lehman&#8217;s and
JPMorgan&#8217;s chief executive officers, in the week before Lehman&#8217;s
bankruptcy, according to the filing. He also met with Dimon and
Henry Paulson, then Treasury Secretary, to discuss &#8220;concerns&#8221;
that Dimon was using the crisis to strengthen his bank at
Lehman&#8217;s expense, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Treasury also has refused to let Paulson testify,
creditors said. They would address the refusal separately, they
said. Lehman&#8217;s official committee of creditors works closely
with the defunct firm on its plans and lawsuits, it has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthony Coley, a Treasury Department spokesman, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a phone call and e-mail message seeking
comment on the filing. Joseph Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman,
didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on
Lehman creditors&#8217; account of Dimon&#8217;s conversations with
officials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history in
2008, listing $613 billion in debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
08-13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). The lawsuit is Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 10-03266, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New York Seeks to Pursue Ernst  Young Lehman Fee Suit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ernst  Young LLP, bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEH)&#8217;s
former auditor, should &#8220;disgorge&#8221; $125 million in fees earned
in an alleged fraud involving so-called Repo 105 transactions
that concealed tens of billions of dollars in debt, the New York
attorney general said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorney General Eric Schneiderman asked a judge Feb. 17 to
let him pursue the suit after the auditing firm tried to get it
dismissed. The state is limited by law from recovering the fees
for itself or for Lehman&#8217;s former shareholders, Ernst  Young
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;EY is wrong on every count,&#8221; Schneiderman said in a
court filing in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. &#8220;It is well-
settled that the state can, and frequently does, obtain
disgorgement of ill-gotten gains under public enforcement
statutes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repo 105 transactions are a form of short-term financing
that Lehman used to move as much as $50 billion off its balance
sheet temporarily to show investors it wasn&#8217;t carrying too much
debt, according to a bankruptcy examiner&#8217;s report. The report
was used as a basis for many suits, including one that Ernst 
Young is fighting by investors including the Alameda County
Employees&#8217; Retirement Association, which alleges the firm made
misleading statements about Lehman&#8217;s finances before its 2008
bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie Perkins, an Ernst  Young spokesman, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to a call and e-mail after regular business
hours seeking comment on the attorney general&#8217;s filing. The
auditing firm has said its work for Lehman met all applicable
professional standards and applied rules that existed at the
time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schneiderman said New York wasn&#8217;t suing on behalf of
Lehman&#8217;s shareholders and could distribute money obtained from
the suit &#8220;in any manner that serves justice, including to the
state.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman filed the biggest U.S. bankruptcy in history in
September 2008 with $639 billion in assets. It has said it will
spend the next few years completing a liquidation to pay
unsecured creditors less than 18 cents on the dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is People of the State of New York v. Ernst 
Young LLP, 11-cv-00384, U.S. District Court, Southern District
of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Legal Challenge to Google Privacy Policy Is Baseless, U.S. Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A privacy group should lose its bid for a court order
forcing the Federal Trade Commission to challenge Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s
changes to its privacy policy, the U.S. Justice Department said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Electronic Privacy Information Center has no basis in
the law to compel the FTC to take enforcement action against
Google, said Drake Cutini, a Justice Department lawyer, in a
filing Feb. 17 in federal court in Washington. The privacy group
sued Feb. 8, claiming Google&#8217;s planned changes to its privacy
policy violate a consent order requiring the search engine
company to protect consumer data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group said in its complaint that the FTC should sue
Google. The consent order stems from a lawsuit that the group,
known as EPIC, filed against Google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are asking the court to dismiss the case because
parties such as EPIC are barred by law from interfering with the
proper investigation and enforcement of FTC orders,&#8221; Claudia
Farrell, an FTC spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There can be no question that the Federal Trade
Commission has a duty to enforce its final order in the Google
matter,&#8221; Marc Rotenberg, EPIC&#8217;s executive director, said in an
e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, the world&#8217;s most-popular search engine, announced
plans on Jan. 24 to unify privacy policies for 60 services and
products including YouTube videos and Android software for
mobile phones. The move, set to take effect March 1, would
simplify conditions for user agreements, the Mountain View,
California-based company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EPIC said the plan would allow Google to combine more
information about users, reduce users&#8217; control of their own data
and give more personal information to advertisers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FTC&#8217;s 2011 settlement with Google over privacy, which
barred sharing user data outside the company without clear
permission, stemmed from a complaint filed by the advocacy group
in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Electronic Privacy Information Center v.
Federal Trade Commission, 12-00206, U.S. District Court,
District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Credit Suisse Trader Case Was Most Popular Docket on Bloomberg &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s suit against
Kareem Serageldin, Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)&#8217;s former global head
of structured credit trading, was the most-read docket on the
Bloomberg Law system last week for the second week in a row. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serageldin was charged in a scheme to falsify prices tied
to collateralized debt obligations to meet targets and boost
year-end bonuses for his $5.35 billion trading book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serageldin, 38, who lives in the U.K. and led the
securities department of Credit Suisse&#8217;s investment banking
division, was named in an indictment on Feb. 1 in New York. Two
of his former subordinates, David Higgs, 42, and Salmaan
Siddiqui, 36, pleaded guilty in federal court in New York on
Feb. 1 and said they&#8217;re cooperating with the U.S. in the probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are U.S. v. Higgs, 12-cr-00088, and U.S. v.
Siddiqui, 12-cr-00089, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan). The SEC case is U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission v. Serageldin, 12-cv-00796, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sergey Aleynikov, a former Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) computer programmer, walked out of a New York
courthouse the day after his conviction for stealing the bank&#8217;s
high-speed trading code was reversed by a U.S. appeals court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wearing a grey sweatsuit, white tennis shoes and a huge
grin, Aleynikov, 42, left the building where he had been
convicted in December 2010 and entered a waiting car with his
lawyer, Kevin Marino. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Justice occasionally works,&#8221; Aleynikov told reporters as
he left Feb. 17. &#8220;This was such big news to me I haven&#8217;t had
any time to think about what would happen.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Russia, said
he hoped to be with his three daughters, ages 8, 6 and 3. Until
Feb. 17, he had been serving an eight-year sentence at the
federal prison in Fort Dix, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m very grateful to my mother and my aunt who supported
me from Russia, and my friends who stood by me and believed in
my innocence,&#8221; he said. &#8220;One lesson you learn is to really
start valuing your life, day-to-day is a victory.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hearing oral arguments from both prosecutors and
Marino Feb. 16, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Manhattan issued a
one-page order vacating Aleynikov&#8217;s convictions for economic
espionage and the interstate transportation of stolen property.
The appeals court said it would issue an opinion explaining the
ruling later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court also issued a mandate that would have
foreclosed any further challenge to its decision. The office of
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara persuaded the court to set
aside the mandate so it can argue for a rehearing of the appeal,
either before a three-judge panel or all the court&#8217;s available
judges. Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for Bharara&#8217;s office,
declined to comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marino said he was confident the appeals court&#8217;s decision
would stand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s over now,&#8221; said Marino, of Marino, Tortorella 
Boyle PC in Chatham, New Jersey. &#8220;We&#8217;re on firm ground. This
was a wrongheaded prosecution that should never have been
brought.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Denise Cote, who presided over the
trial, ordered Aleynikov released from prison Feb. 17. After a
brief hearing this afternoon with prosecutors, Aleynikov and his
lawyers, she agreed to release him on his own recognizance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov was convicted by a jury in December 2010 of
violating the Economic Espionage Act and the Interstate
Transportation of Stolen Property Act. He was sentenced last
March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On his last day of work at New York-based Goldman Sachs in
June 2009, Aleynikov uploaded hundreds of thousands of lines of
source code from the firm&#8217;s high-frequency trading system,
prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He circumvented Goldman Sachs&#8217;s security, sent the code to
a server in Germany, compressed and encrypted it, and took it
with him to a meeting with new employers in Chicago, the U.S.
said. Prosecutors argued Aleynikov wanted it as a &#8220;cheat
sheet&#8221; to start a trading system at his new job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Aleynikov, 1:10-cr-00096, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Facebook Wins Lawsuit Against Power Ventures Over Login Data &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc. (FB), the operator of the world&#8217;s largest social-
networking site, won a 2008 lawsuit accusing Power Ventures
Inc.&#8217;s Power.com of accessing and storing users&#8217; login data
without authorization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling on Feb. 16 by U.S. District Judge James Ware
paves the way for hearings on damages for Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The undisputed facts establish that defendants
circumvented technical barriers&#8221; to access Facebook&#8217;s site,
Ware wrote in a 19-page opinion issued without a trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook sued Power Ventures in December 2008 in federal
court in San Jose, California, saying Power.com offered users
the ability to retrieve their Facebook messages and other
information from Facebook&#8217;s computer servers without permission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook, based in Menlo Park, California, accused
Power.com of infringing its copyrights and trademarks and
violating computer fraud and unfair competition laws. It sought
a court order prohibiting further access and unspecific damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power Ventures is based in the Cayman Islands, according to
court papers. Power.com is up for sale on the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook filed papers with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission for an initial public offering on Feb. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased that the court ruled in our favor,&#8221; Craig
Clark, lead litigation counsel for Facebook, said in an e-mailed
statement. &#8220;We will continue to enforce our rights against bad
actors who attempt to circumvent Facebook&#8217;s privacy and security
protections and spam people.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Facebook has established a dangerous precedent for the
future of users rights to own and control their data,&#8221; said
Steven Vachani, chief executive officer of Power Ventures, in an
e-mailed statement. &#8220;We intend to aggressively continue this
fight.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Facebook Inc. v. Power Ventures Inc., 08CV5780,
U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;HTC Loses Patent Case Against Apple at Trade Agency &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTC Corp. (2498) lost a patent-infringement claim against Apple
Inc. (AAPL) at the U.S. International Trade Commission, the first of
the Taiwanese handset maker&#8217;s cases targeting the iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple didn&#8217;t violate an HTC patent for controlling how
mobile phones manage power supply, the Washington-based
commission said Feb. 16. The ruling completes a review of an
October finding by an agency judge, who had determined that
Apple devices didn&#8217;t infringe HTC&#8217;s intellectual property. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission also found that HTC wasn&#8217;t using the
invention at issue in the case, a requirement to have an
infringement violation found against another company. The
agency&#8217;s full opinion will be made available after both sides
have a chance to redact confidential information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are disappointed by the commission&#8217;s ruling, and look
forward to reading the full opinion to understand its
reasoning,&#8221; Grace Lei, HTC&#8217;s general counsel, said in an e-
mail. &#8220;We&#8217;ll explore all options, including appeal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTC, the second-largest maker of devices that run on Google
Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Android software, has a second case against Apple that is
scheduled to begin Aug. 30. Cupertino, California-based Apple
and Taoyuan, Taiwan-based HTC have been using patent lawsuits to
help protect their share of the smartphone market, which
expanded 55 percent last quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple filed first in March 2010, seeking to block imports
of HTC&#8217;s Android phones. Apple contends that Android devices
infringe its patents. The commission, which can ban imports of
products found to infringe U.S. patents, found in December that
HTC was infringing an Apple patent related to data-detection.
HTC said it&#8217;s been able to design around that feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HTC case against Apple is In the Matter of Portable
Electronic Devices, 337-721, U.S. International Trade Commission
(Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apple Files Competition Claim Against Motorola Mobility &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. (MMI) said Apple Inc. filed a
complaint with the European Union&#8217;s competition authority
accusing the company of violating a pledge to license industry-
standard patents on fair terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility said in a regulatory filing that it was
notified of the complaint Feb. 17 by the European Commission.
Jennifer Erickson, a Motorola Mobility spokeswoman, said the
company is willing to negotiate a patent license with Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple and Motorola Mobility have sued each other in the
U.S. and Europe over technology used in smartphones, a market
that researcher IDC said grew 55 percent last year. Motorola
Mobility won two out of three rulings in lawsuits it filed
against Apple in a Mannheim, Germany, court, and in one case
forced Apple to remove some older iPhone and iPad models from
its online store in Germany. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies often collaborate on standards that are used to
make products work together, with participants pledging to
fairly license any patents on the standards they help create.
Apple contends Motorola Mobility (MMI) is violating that commitment.
Motorola Mobility, which has said it&#8217;s been in licensing talks
with Apple since 2007, denied the charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;MMI has a long-standing practice of licensing our patents
on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and we offered
those to Apple,&#8221; Erickson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German courts have become the focal point of litigation
between the two companies, with each seeking orders that would
limit sales of the others&#8217; products. On Feb. 16, a court in
Munich said Motorola Mobility&#8217;s mobile phones infringe an Apple
patent for a method of unlocking touch screens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc., which is buying Libertyville, Illinois-based
Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, pledged to continue the
company&#8217;s licensing practices. Regulators in Europe and the U.S.
granted approval to the purchase while expressing some
reservation about how industry-standard patents are handled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hyundai, Kia Sued by Toyota Foe in Fight Over Hybrids &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp. (000270) were named in a
patent-infringement lawsuit filed by a company that had been
embroiled in a years-long fight with Toyota Motor Corp. over
hybrid-engine technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closely held Paice LLC and Baltimore&#8217;s Abell Foundation, a
non-profit that&#8217;s invested in Paice, filed the suit Feb. 16 in
federal court in Baltimore, accusing the Seoul-based automakers
of infringing three patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint targets Hyundai&#8217;s Sonata Hybrid and the Kia
Optima Hybrid. Hyundai and Kia, which are affiliated and whose
hybrid vehicles use the same powertrain technology, were aware
of the patent litigation with Toyota. The litigation ended with
a 2010 settlement reached after eight years of legal fighting,
Paice said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Since as early as 2004, Paice has contacted Hyundai on
numerous occasions and offered to discuss its patented hybrid
technology,&#8221; Paice said in the complaint. The company is
seeking cash compensation and an order that prevents further use
of the technology without permission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Hyundai Motor America is still examining the issues
raised in the lawsuit, which we received a short time ago, and
is not able to comment on the specifics of the suit at this
time,&#8221; Chris Hosford, a spokesman for Hyundai said. Officials
with Kia couldn&#8217;t immediately be reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paice was founded by Alex Severinsky, a Soviet emigrant who
began his career developing antitank-warfare instrumentation. In
the 1990s, he developed a high-voltage method to power gas-
electric vehicles that he contends is the basis for modern
hybrid technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford Motor Co., maker of the Fusion hybrid car, also agreed
to license Paice&#8217;s technology to resolve lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Paice LLC v. Hyundai Motor Co. (005380), 12cv499, U.S.
District Court for the District of Maryland (Baltimore). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Megaupload Defendants Face More Criminal Counts, U.S. Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Megaupload.com, a file-sharing website charged with
illegally distributing copyrighted movies and music, faces more
counts of criminal copyright infringement and wire fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A revised indictment filed in a U.S. court in Alexandria,
Virginia, on Feb. 16 charged Megaupload.com and founder Kim Dotcom with three new criminal copyright counts and five new
wire fraud counts for allegedly running an illegal enterprise
for five years that unlawfully copied works and made them
available for download to customers. The original Jan. 5
indictment included five counts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since September 2005, what prosecutors have dubbed the
&#8220;Mega Conspiracy&#8221; has generated more than $175 million in
criminal proceeds by distributing millions of copies of
copyrighted works, such as movies, television programs, music,
books, video games and software, according to the indictment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Megaupload reproduced copyrighted works directly from other
websites including Google Inc.&#8217;s YouTube for illegal sharing and
to give the false impression that a related video-sharing
website hosted user-generated, rather than copyrighted, content,
prosecutors said in an e-mailed statement on Feb. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conspiracy was led by Dotcom, a resident of Hong Kong
and New Zealand and a dual citizen of Finland and Germany, who
founded Megaupload Ltd., according to the indictment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dotcom, imprisoned in New Zealand since Jan. 20 at the
request of the U.S., failed to win release Feb. 16 after a judge
declined to immediately rule on his bid for bail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v Megaupload.com, 12-0003, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of Virginia (Alexandria). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Spider-Man&#8217; Trial Over Script Royalties Scheduled for January &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Director Julie Taymor and the producers of &#8220;Spider-Man:
Turn Off the Dark&#8221; are set to square off in federal court in
Manhattan in January, 10 years after Marvel Entertainment (MVL) began
negotiating for its superhero to fly on Broadway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In court on Feb. 17, U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest
scheduled a jury trial to start Jan. 7, to resolve Taymor&#8217;s
claim that she&#8217;s owed money as co-author of the show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Feb. 16, producers and the Stage Directors and
Choreographers Society announced a settlement regarding her
director royalties. The lead producers are Michael Cohl and
Jeremiah Harris. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taymor, 59, was removed from the stunt-filled $75 million
musical in March, 2011, after critics lambasted it during an
extended preview period. She sued the producers on Nov. 8,
saying they violated her intellectual property rights by making
changes without her permission and didn&#8217;t pay royalties due her
as a co-book writer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her suit, Taymor claims she&#8217;s owed at least $2,917.50 a
week from April 17, 2011, to the present, plus damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dale Cendali, a lawyer in the New York office of Kirkland 
Ellis who represents  Cohl and Harris&#8217;s 8 Legged Productions,
declined to comment after the hearing. Taymor&#8217;s spokesman, Chris
Kanarick, didn&#8217;t return an e-mail on Feb. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Julie Taymor v. 8 Legged Productions LLC, 1:11-
cv-08002-RJH, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lawyer Says National Candidates Violate Songwriters&#8217; Rights &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue of political campaigns using popular songs
without permission has come up again this year. Newt Gingrich is
being sued for using Survivor&#8217;s &#8220;Eye of the Tiger&#8221; and K&#8217;naan
has asked Mitt Romney to stop using his &#8220;Wavin&#8217; Flag.&#8221;
Lawrence Iser, an attorney at Kinsella Weitzman Iser Kump 
Aldisert in Santa Monica, California, who represented both
Jackson Browne and David Byrne when their songs were used in

&lt;h2&gt;Pirate Bay Website Infringes U.K. Record Copyrights, Judge Rules &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony Corp. (6758)&#8217;s British unit and eight other record labels won
a U.K. trial on their claims that users and operators of Pirate
Bay, the Sweden-based website used for online file sharing,
violate their copyrights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operators of the site, who weren&#8217;t represented at the
trial, &#8220;incite or persuade&#8221; users to commit copyright
infringement, Judge Richard Arnold ruled yesterday in London.
The users have &#8220;a common design to infringe.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Pirate Bay isn&#8217;t a defendant, the court&#8217;s finding was
required before the record labels could seek a court order
forcing British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY) and five other
Internet-service providers to block access to the site,
according to the judgment. Arnold said the case was similar to a
landmark ruling last year in which ISPs were ordered to block
access to a file-sharing website known as Newzbin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pirate Bay enables downloading of digitized music and films
using software called BitTorrent that enables complete works to
be assembled from pieces on other users&#8217; computers. The site has
faced civil and criminal proceedings in other countries,
including in Sweden. Arnold said the website was openly opposed
to the record labels&#8217; copyrights. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should wager the British
pound will weaken further against Norway&#8217;s krone as the
Scandinavian country&#8217;s central bank finds itself unable to stem
the currency&#8217;s strength, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The krone rose versus all of its 16 most-traded
counterparts today as crude oil climbed to a nine-month high and
stronger-than-estimated labor-market data fueled speculation
Norges Bank may refrain from cutting interest rates next month,
after reducing them a half-percentage point in December to 1.75
percent. Norway is the world&#8217;s seventh-largest oil exporter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The surprising 50 basis-point rate cut by Norges Bank in
December now looks too aggressive,&#8221; strategists headed by
Thomas Stolper, London-based chief foreign-exchange strategist
at Goldman Sachs International, wrote today in a note to
clients. &#8220;With the currency already strong relative to recent
ranges, Norges Bank likely has little scope to use monetary
policy to prevent further Norwegian krone strength.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.K., the strategists noted, minutes from this
month&#8217;s Bank of England meeting released today showed two policy
makers wanted a larger increase in asset purchases than the
amount finally approved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The krone gained 1.5 percent to 8.8532 to the pound today
and touched 8.8497, the strongest level since Oct. 31. It has
strengthened 4.9 percent this year against the U.K. currency.
The pound fell against all of its major peers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stolper recommended that investors bet against the pound
with an initial target of 8.6 kroner and a stop order at a one-
day close above 9 in case sterling gains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robin Brooks, a note author based in New York, couldn&#8217;t
immediately be reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sterling Slides &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sterling weakened today after the BOE minutes showed Adam
Posen and David Miles voted for a 75 billion-pound ($118
billion) boost in quantitative easing, versus the 50 billion
pounds supported by the other seven members of the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude oil for April delivery rose as much as 1.2 percent to
$106.72 a barrel in New York, the highest level since May 5.
Norway&#8217;s unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 3.3 percent in
the December quarter, data showed. Economists in a Bloomberg
News survey predicted no change from the previous period&#8217;s 3.4
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By David Glovin" date="Feb 22, 2012  5:13 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-22/sec-seeks-testimony-of-ex-ikb-employee-in-suit-against-goldman-s-tourre.html"><headline>SEC Seeks Testimony of Ex-IKB Employee in Lawsuit Against Goldman&#8217;s Tourre</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission wants to question a former employee of IKB Deutsche
Industriebank AG (IKB) in its lawsuit against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
trader Fabrice Tourre, court records show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC today asked a federal judge in New York to issue a
so-called letter of request that would allow the agency to take
testimony from Jorg Zimmerman, a resident of Germany. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency sued Tourre in 2010, saying he defrauded
investors by not disclosing that hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped
pick the underlying securities for a collateralized debt
obligation, known as Abacus, and planned to bet against them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reaching a $550 million settlement with New York-
based Goldman Sachs, the SEC filed a new claim against Tourre,
saying he gave the company &#8220;substantial assistance&#8221; as it
misled investors. The SEC said IKB wouldn&#8217;t have invested if it
had known of Paulson&#8217;s involvement in the portfolio selection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Tourre personally spoke with IKB employee Jorg Zimmerman
to solicit interest in ABACUS 2007-ACI securities,&#8221; the SEC
said in its filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency said its lawyers want to ask Zimmerman about
IKB&#8217;s decision to invest, the representations that Tourre and
Goldman Sachs made to the bank, &#8220;and the importance of the
facts omitted by Tourre&#8221; and Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Jersey Firms &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zimmerman isn&#8217;t a defendant in the case. Tourre has denied
wrongdoing in the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pamela Rogers Chepiga, a lawyer for Tourre, said in an
interview that today&#8217;s request is a corrected version of an SEC
filing from several weeks ago, and that she has also asked the
German court to order testimony. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre has said in court that the $150 million investment
was actually made by two Jersey-based firms in the Channel
Islands, and not by Dusseldorf, Germany-based IKB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have to finish up discovery in Germany,&#8221; Chepiga
said. Discovery is the gathering and sharing of evidence before
a trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones in Manhattan last year
refused to dismiss the case while narrowing some of the claims
against Tourre. She said the SEC had met its burden for pursuing
a claim that Tourre violated a law designed to prevent
fraudulent sales of securities and should stand trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Tourre, 10-cv-03229, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) won a
judge&#8217;s approval of a lawsuit settlement that will require the
bank to pay $993,841 to a group of computer technicians who said
they weren&#8217;t paid overtime for their work as contractors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley in Manhattan today
entered a judgment approving the settlement, citing reasons he
stated at a Feb. 10 court conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the lawsuit, the technicians said they deserved overtime
pay for working more than 40 hours a week. Work weeks topped 70
hours, and more than 100 employees in New York and New Jersey
were underpaid as a result, they said in a complaint filed in
May 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Wells, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to comment
on the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the plaintiffs will be paid $262,787 plus
expenses, which will come from the settlement fund, Pauley said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bardouille v. Goldman Sachs  Co., 10-cv-4285,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;California (STOCA1) is seeking to use capital
from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Barclays Bank Plc and other
lenders to encourage landlords to make energy-saving changes at
their buildings, state Senator Kevin de Le&#243;n said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De Le&#243;n, a Los Angeles Democrat, introduced legislation
today that would make low-interest loans available to owners of
commercial and industrial property for energy retrofits. The
state would aggregate loans and issue revenue bonds to repay
them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview in the state Capitol in Sacramento, de Le&#243;n
said the state also is working with Citigroup Inc., Wells Fargo
 Co. and GE Capital Corp. on providing &#8220;hundreds of millions
of dollars&#8221; to building owners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This will be a big boon,&#8221; de Le&#243;n said. &#8220;You&#8217;re getting
hundreds of millions of dollars in equity off the sidelines.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De Le&#243;n, state Controller John Chiang and state Treasurer
Bill Lockyer have been working with the banks on a program they
said would help rejuvenate California&#8217;s construction industry
while curbing energy use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The California Alternative Energy and Advanced
Transportation Financing Authority, whose members include Chiang
and Lockyer, would set criteria for building owners to qualify
for the loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Michael B. Marois" date="Feb 22, 2012  1:44 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-22/barclays-jpmorgan-complete-1-billion-loan-to-help-california-pay-bills.html"><headline>Barclays, JPMorgan Complete $1 Billion Loan to Help California Pay Bills</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;California (STOCA1) sold $1 billion of short-
term notes to Barclays Plc and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) to pay bills
after tax collections in the biggest U.S. state by population
trailed budgeted amounts, according to the treasurer&#8217;s office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks will earn 0.2 percent interest on the so-called
revenue-anticipation notes, Treasurer Bill Lockyer said in a
statement. The state will repay the notes by June 30, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loan was needed after Controller John Chiang said in
January that because tax collections trailed budget projections
and spending exceeded estimates, the state would face a $3.3
billion cash shortfall by mid-April. It&#8217;s the third such sale
this fiscal year, which began July 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re pleased we&#8217;ve completed this part of the cash-
management solution,&#8221; Tom Dresslar, a spokesman for Lockyer,
said in the statement. &#8220;We believe we obtained a good deal for
taxpayers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lockyer in July secured a $5.4 billion interim loan from
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), and six other banks
and investors. The treasurer took the loan anticipating a
possible credit-market disruption as Congress debated raising
the nation&#8217;s debt ceiling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Previous Sale &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two months later he borrowed another $5.4 billion through
revenue-anticipation notes that were supposed to carry the state
through June. State and local governments commonly sell such
notes to bolster cash flow until more tax receipts arrive later
in the fiscal year. California repaid the interim loan with
proceeds from that sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest loan would be repaid before June 30, though not
until after the September notes, which mature June 26. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, lawmakers passed and Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill that lets the state shift $865 million in
internal accounts to help avert the cash shortfall. Chiang also
has said he temporarily delayed making more than $1 billion in
scheduled payments to public colleges, counties and health
programs for the poor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The California Public Employees&#8217; Retirement System, the
largest public pension in the U.S., with $235.5 billion of
assets, agreed last month to let the state delay making a $527
million payment until April to cover worker benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lockyer also sold $860 million of taxable revenue bonds
today for the University of California. Called &#8220;century bonds&#8221;
because they mature in 100 years, the debt was priced to yield
4.86 percent, or about 165 basis points more than 30-year U.S.
Treasuries (USGG30YR) as of yesterday, Dresslar said in the statement. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lockyer boosted the size of the sale by $500 million
because of demand, Dresslar said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) filed a complaint
with European antitrust regulators saying Motorola Mobility
Holdings Inc. (MMI) and Google Inc. (GOOG) are trying to block sales of
personal computers and game consoles that run its software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility is violating a pledge to license
industry-standard patents on fair terms and &#8220;demanding that
Microsoft take its products off the market,&#8221; Microsoft said in
a blog post. Apple Inc. (AAPL) has also filed a complaint to the
European Union over Motorola Mobility&#8217;s licensing terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have taken this step because Motorola is attempting to
block sales of Windows PCs, our Xbox game console and other
products,&#8221; Microsoft said. Legal actions by Motorola Mobility
to enforce its patents may &#8220;kill&#8221; video-streaming services on
the Internet, Microsoft said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility, Microsoft, Samsung Electronics Co. and
Apple are involved in numerous patent lawsuits in Europe as
demand for smartphones and tablets soar. Google, which is buying
Libertyville, Illinois-based Motorola Mobility for $12.5
billion, has written to groups that establish industry standards
to assure them it will license Motorola Mobility patents on a
fair and reasonable basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Step Back&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Watching video on the Web is one of the primary uses of
computers these days,&#8221; Microsoft said in its statement.
&#8220;Imagine what a step back it would be if we could no longer
watch videos on our computing devices or connect via Wi-Fi, or
if only some products, but not others, had these capabilities,&#8221;
it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are yet to receive a copy of the complaint, but
Motorola is committed to vigorously defending its intellectual
property,&#8221; Gemma Goatly, a spokeswoman for Motorola Mobility,
said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s complaint also covers Google because the firm
hasn&#8217;t committed to changing Motorola Mobility&#8217;s policy, the
Redmond, Washington-based company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft&#8217;s complaint is just another example of their
attempts to use the regulatory process to attack competitors,&#8221;
Niki Fenwick, a spokesperson for Google, said in an e-mailed
statement. &#8220;It&#8217;s particularly ironic given their track record
in this area and collaboration with patent trolls.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission has &#8220;received this complaint and
we will examine it,&#8221; Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for EU
antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia, said in an e-mail. Samsung is
already being investigated by EU antitrust regulators over
whether it broke licensing commitments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Playground Monitor&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The European Commission is a little bit, in this context,
like the playground monitor when it comes to U.S. technology
companies,&#8221; said Andrew Updegrove, a lawyer with Gesmer
Updegrove LLP in Boston who advises standard-setting boards on
intellectual property policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s really a kind of scuffle where everyone tries to
bend the ear of the European Commission to make life
uncomfortable for their rivals,&#8221; Updegrove said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility also has filed complaints against Apple
and Microsoft at the U.S. International Trade Commission in
Washington, to block imports of Apple&#8217;s iPhone and Microsoft&#8217;s
xBox into the U.S. Apple and Microsoft have argued that the
agency shouldn&#8217;t issue exclusion orders when the patents are
essential to industry standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Microsoft and Apple have said they wouldn&#8217;t seek a
court order to block use of technology covered by industry-
standard patents even as they pursue infringement claims over
non-essential patents against Motorola Mobility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google has said it would seek a royalty fee of no more than
2.25 percent of the net cost of devices using its patents, and
would try to resolve any disputes through negotiation before
asking courts to block use of the Motorola Mobility technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are aware of the increasingly strategic use of patents
in the sector and are vigilant,&#8221; the EU&#8217;s Almunia said Feb. 13.
&#8220;We can avoid a continuation of this patent war.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s (GS) hedge
fund industry group chief, C. Howard Wietschner, is retiring
after 18 years at the securities firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The departure of Wietschner, who was named partner a decade
ago, was disclosed in a memo today to employees, a copy of which
was obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wietschner, 44, joined New York-based Goldman Sachs in 1994
in the firm&#8217;s convertible sales group after working for three
years at law firm Weil Gotshal  Manges LLP (1127L), according to the
memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was co-head of Goldman Sach&#8217;s U.S. convertibles desk and
ran relative value sales and trading in 2000. Wietschner in 2007
helped form the bank&#8217;s hedge fund industry group, which offers
advisory services for alternative asset managers, according to
the memo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OMV AG (OMV), central Europe&#8217;s biggest oil
company, said it discovered what may be its biggest gas find in
a Black Sea well it is exploring together with a unit of Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM) Shares soared in Vienna trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The exploration well encountered 70.7 meters of net gas
pay, resulting in a preliminary estimate for the accumulation
ranging from 1.5 to 3 trillion cubic feet (42 to 84 billion
cubic meters),&#8221; OMV said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Domino-1 well, which is operated by the Exxon unit, is
located in the Neptun Block, 170 kilometers (106 miles) offshore
in water about 1,000 meters deep, according to the statement.
Drilling operations started at year-end 2011 and the total depth
of the well is expected to be more than 3,000 meters below sea
level. OMV Petrom (SNP) and Exxon each hold 50 percent in the well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This may be the biggest find in OMV&#8217;s history,&#8221; Chief
Executive Officer Gerhard Roiss told reporters in Vienna today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OMV shares advanced after the announcement, climbing 4.3
percent to 28.78 euros at the 5:30 p.m. close of trading in the
Austrian capital. Petrom shares rose 5.1 percent to 0.41 lei in
Bucharest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Multi-Billion Dollar Investment &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies are planning new 3D seismic acquisition
during 2012, Jaap Huijskes, who heads exploration and production
at OMV, said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &#8220;it is too early in the data evaluation and
exploration process to determine whether the Neptun block will
ultimately prove to be commercially developable or not,&#8221; the
companies would need to spend &#8220;multiple billions of dollars to
develop&#8221; Domino-1, he said, adding that potential first
production would be &#8220;toward the end of the decade at the
earliest.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s Romania unit head Ian Fischer said in August that
the first drilling of the well may cost about $150 million
and that the companies may invest between $3 billion and $10
billion to operate the block if the testing proves to be
successful, according to Mediafax. OMV today declined to comment
on specific amounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appraisal wells and 3D Seismic &#8220;will take some time, the
Black Sea is not off the coast of Aberdeen, it takes some time
to get rigs into the Black Sea and it takes time to get seismic
vessels into the Black Sea,&#8221; Huijskes said, declining to
specify a time frame. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting up the rig for the initial drilling took one year
as it had to be dismantled to pass under bridges in the
Bosphorus Straits, said CEO Rois. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nigeria, Africa&#8217;s largest oil
producer, said crude-producing licenses operated by Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA) and Chevron Corp. (CVX) will be renewed within a month as it
concludes a review of expired or soon-to-lapse leases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will renew the expired licenses before the end of
March,&#8221; Austen Oniwon, group managing director of state-owned
Nigerian National Petroleum Corp., said at a conference in
Abuja, the capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The West Africa nation signed a deal today with Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM) to renew for 20 years oil leases 67, 68 and 70, which
together produce about 550,000 barrels a day, Mark Ward,
managing director of Exxon&#8217;s Nigerian unit, told reporters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negotiations for 16 oil blocks operated by companies
including Exxon, Shell and Chevron have been under way for over
two years. Shell is &#8220;optimistic&#8221; about the process and the
&#8220;sooner the renewals, the better,&#8221; Mutiu Sunmonu, the
company&#8217;s chairman for Nigeria, said at the conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigeria is the fifth-biggest source of U.S. crude imports.
Shell, Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Total SA (FP) and Eni SpA (ENI) operate joint
ventures with Nigerian National Petroleum that pump about 90
percent of the country&#8217;s crude. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investment-banking revenue will drop
about 4 percent this year as commissions earned from advising on
mergers, underwriting securities and trading fall, JPMorgan
Cazenove analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue will be 13 percent lower in the first quarter
compared with the year-earlier period, analysts led by Kian Abouhossein wrote in a note to clients today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysts upgraded their estimate for fixed-income,
currencies and commodities sales to a 13 percent drop for the
first quarter from a decline of 26 percent after a &#8220;material
improvement&#8221; at the start of the year. Their estimate for total
sales this year was unchanged at 6 percent lower than 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We witnessed material improvement in investment banking
overall revenues from the first two weeks of January into
February, leading us to upgrade our year-on-year FICC revenue
estimate,&#8221; analysts said in the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Income from equities will be down 15 percent in the first
quarter and 5 percent for the full year over the year-earlier
period, the analysts said. Revenues from investment banking,
which includes advising companies on mergers and underwriting
debt and equity sales, will decline 16 percent in the first
quarter compared with the year-earlier period amid a dearth of
rights offerings and initial public offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s revenue will outperform Morgan
Stanley (MS), the analysts said. UBS AG (UBSN), Switzerland&#8217;s biggest bank,
remains their top stock pick in the industry because a drop in
revenue may prompt the Zurich-based firm to scale back in
investment banking, releasing the proceeds to shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In short, UBS investment bank should be much smaller than
management&#8217;s targets and the release of equity will be highly
accretive to shareholders,&#8221; the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memory-chip designer Rambus Inc. (RMBS)&#8217;s
conduct before an industry board won&#8217;t be reviewed by the U.S.
Supreme Court, clearing an obstacle in the company&#8217;s decade-long
pursuit of patent royalties from semiconductor makers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high court yesterday declined to take an appeal of a
lower-court decision clearing Rambus of accusations it
improperly used knowledge gleaned from a standard-setting board
to obtain patents so it could extract royalties from the
computer-chip industry. The case was brought by Hynix
Semiconductor Inc. as part of an effort to overturn a $397
million judgment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rambus contends that the semiconductor industry conspired
to steal its technology and has filed patent-infringement
lawsuits against companies that refuse to pay licensing fees.
The litigation has defined Sunnyvale, California-based Rambus
since the late 1990s, and its activities at the semiconductor
industry&#8217;s standard-setting board form the basis of those
disputes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high court declined to hear two previous appeals of
rulings that favored Rambus on the issue of the company&#8217;s
participation in the industry board &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Hynix Semiconductor Inc. v. Rambus Inc., 11-549, U.S. Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JJ Bid to Reinstate Abbott Verdict Rejected by U.S. High Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court rejected Johnson  Johnson (JNJ)&#8217;s request
to reinstate the largest patent-infringement verdict in American
history, a $1.67 billion award it won against Abbott
Laboratories (ABT) over arthritis treatments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high court yesterday declined to review a lower court
ruling that a patent on a method to make antibodies was invalid
because it inadequately described what JJ&#8217;s Janssen Biotech
said it invented. JJ and patent co-owner New York University
want to collect on the verdict they received over the drug
Humira. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A U.S. appeals court said inventors must describe their
work clearly to show they conceived the invention and that
failure to do so may lead to the patent&#8217;s being tossed out. JJ
contends that requirement is too onerous when it comes to
patents on basic research or discoveries that have broad
applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute centers on a method to create antibodies that
block the action of tumor necrosis factor, or TNF. When the body
produces too much TNF, it can cause the immune system to attack
healthy tissue and leads to inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ruling the patent invalid, the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit said the claims made in the invention, as
written, &#8220;constitute a wish list of properties&#8221; that a human
antibody should have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A March 2010 Federal Circuit decision laying out the
written description requirement got U.S. support, Abbott said,
and JJ &#8220;seeks to disrupt the settled expectations of
innovators like Abbott by upending decades of precedent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk A/S (NOVOB), the world&#8217;s largest insulin maker, and
vaccine maker Bavarian Nordic A/S (BAVA) urged the high court to take
the case, saying they need broadly written patents to protect
their research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbott has filed its own lawsuit, claiming JJ&#8217;s arthritis
drug Simponi, made with human antibodies, is infringing an
Abbott patent. It also claims a JJ psoriasis medicine, Stelara,
violates two other patents. Those cases are pending in federal
court in Worcester, Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Janssen Biotech Inc. v. Abbott Laboratories,
11-596, U.S. Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Berkshire Hathaway&#8217;s Geico Newest MacroSolve Patent Target &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)&#8217;s Geico unit is the most recent
defendant sued for infringing a patent held by an Oklahoma-based
mobile data company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MacroSolve Inc. of Tulsa, Oklahoma, filed the suit against
Geico Feb. 21 in federal court in Tulsa, Oklahoma. This suit is
among 28 the company has filed in the same court since March
2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the defendants MacroSolve sued earlier are Facebook
Inc., Marriott International Inc., Apple Inc., Dell Inc. and
Priceline.com Inc., as well as a number of smaller companies
that create apps for mobile devices. The various defendants are
accused of infringing patent 7,822,816. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent, which was issued in October 2010, is related to

&lt;h2&gt;Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s Russian Trademark Dispute Goes to Court April 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s trademark-infringement suit related to
its &#8220;Windows&#8221; trademark is to be heard April 11 in Moscow
Commercial Court, the Russian Legal Information Agency reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based software company is seeking
to bar Dmitry Shapovalov, identified by the news agency as a
Russian businessman, from using the mark in his &#8220;Windows.ru&#8221;
domain name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presently the website is blocked, the news agency reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An attorney representing Shapovalov told the news agency
that Microsoft&#8217;s claim to the &#8220;Windows&#8221; mark is unclear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Big Ginger&#8217; Trademark Suit Against Pernod-Ricard Settled &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trademark infringement suit against Pernod-Ricard SA (RI) has
been settled, according to a Feb. 21 court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit, filed by a Minnesota company that promotes its
proprietary brand of Irish whiskey, was related to a cocktail
developed to expand the range of consumers for the product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint filed Feb. 15 in federal court
in Minnesota, the Big Ginger cocktail, comprised of Irish
whiskey, ginger ale, lemon and lime, was designed to extend the
appeal of Irish whiskey beyond its usual drinkers -- middle-aged
and older men who drank whiskey in the colder months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big Ginger made the product &#8220;accessible and inviting to
all types of consumers and allows for a new perception of a
spirit that is traditionally thought of as solely masculine,
extreme/harsh,&#8221; Minneapolis-based A Kieran Collective LLC said
in its complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cocktail, originally made with Pernod-Ricard&#8217;s Jameson
Irish whiskey, proved to be so successful that the pub where it
was invented became the single largest on-premise seller of
Jameson&#8217;s in the world, from 2006 through 2011, according to
court papers.  After the &#8220;Big Ginger&#8221; trademark was issued,
Pernod-Ricard made an offer to buy it for $200,000, which was
rejected by the brand owner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brand owner then went on to develop and import its own
proprietary Irish whiskey, for which it uses the &#8220;2 Gingers&#8221;
mark. At the pub where the cocktail was developed, 2 Gingers is
now used instead of Jameson&#8217;s, and the drink is poured in 2
Gingers-branded glasses, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit was filed after Pernod-Ricard&#8217;s Jameson unit began
providing Minnesota restaurants promotional material for &#8220;Big
Jameson Ginger.&#8221; Jameson was accused of trying to benefit from
the fame created by &#8220;Big Ginger.&#8221; The brand owner claimed in
the complaint that Paris-based Pernod-Ricard appeared to be
promoting &#8220;Big Jameson Ginger&#8221; in order to drive sales of
Jameson&#8217;s in the weeks leading to St. Patrick&#8217;s Day March 17,
which is the busiest period in the year for sales of Irish
whiskey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parties in the case reached an amicable settlement of
the dispute, according to a letter from lawyers for the brand
owner that was filed with the court Feb. 21. They asked that a
hearing on their motion for a restraining order against Pernod-Ricard be canceled, and said they expect to dismiss the case
next week. No terms of the settlement were disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is A Kieran Collection LLC v. Irish Distillers
Ltd., 0:12-cv-00395-MJD-TNL, U.S. District Court, District of
Minnesota (Minneapolis). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Paramount Pictures Sues Puzo Estate Over &#8216;Godfather&#8217; Sequels &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paramount Pictures Corp. sued Anthony Puzo, the son and
executor of the estate of author Mario Puzo, to prevent the
publication of a new sequel novel to &#8220;The Godfather.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paramount, which says it bought the copyright to Puzo&#8217;s
novel in 1969, is trying &#8220;protect the integrity and reputation
of The Godfather trilogy,&#8221; according to a complaint filed Feb.
17 in federal court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paramount claimed that, after Puzo&#8217;s death in 1999, the
company agreed to allow Bertelsmann AG&#8217;s Random House unit to
publish a single Godfather sequel, &#8220;The Godfather Returns,&#8221; in
2004. The estate published another novel, &#8220;The Godfather&#8217;s
Revenge,&#8221; in 2006 without Paramount&#8217;s approval, according to
the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Far from properly honoring the legacy of &#8216;The Godfather,&#8217;
the unauthorized &#8216;The Godfather&#8217;s Revenge&#8217; tarnished, and in the
process, also misled consumers into believing that &#8216;The
Godfather&#8217;s Revenge&#8217; was authorized by Paramount,&#8221; Paramount, a
unit of New York-based Viacom Inc. (VIAB), said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paramount is seeking damages and an order barring the Puzo
estate from publishing the third sequel novel, &#8220;The Family
Corleone,&#8221; this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bertram Fields, a Los Angeles lawyer who represented the
Puzo estate in an earlier lawsuit against Paramount, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a message seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paramount claims that the Puzo estate infringed its
copyright and trademarks, which the company has used in films,
video games, software, clothing and prints. The trademark
consists of the words The Godfather and a hand holding puppet
strings. Paramount said the Puzo estate plans to use the
trademarks without authorization to promote the new sequel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first Godfather film was released in 1972 and won
Academy Awards for best picture, actor and adapted screenplay.
Puzo shared credit for the screenplay. Francis Ford Coppola
directed the three Godfather movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Paramount Pictures Corp. v. Puzo, 12-CV-1268,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two Canadian Schools Sign Far-Reaching Copyright Agreement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Canadian universities signed an agreement with Canada&#8217;s
copyright licensing agency that defines e-mailing hyperlinks as
equivalent to making a photocopy, the Bulletin of the Canadian
Association of University Teachers reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement with Access Copyright, signed by the
University of Western Ontario and the University of Toronto,
also permits surveillance of academic staff e-mail and requires
an annual fee of C$27.50 ($27.58) for every full-time equivalent
student, according to the Bulletin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many other Canadian universities have refused to sign the
agreement, the Bulletin reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Turk, CAUT&#8217;s executive director, said better
alternatives to the agreement are available, and his group is
working with library organizations, copyright officers and
academic staff associations &#8220;to protect academic rights to the
fair use of copyrighted material, according to the Bulletin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) cut its 12-
month prediction for commodity returns, while forecasting gains
for crude oil and gold and keeping an &#8220;overweight&#8221; allocation
in raw materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank reduced its estimate for returns to 12 percent
from 15 percent after prices rallied this year, analysts led by
Jeffrey Currie said in a report today. They kept their
predictions for Brent and gold at $127.50 a barrel and $1,940 an
ounce compared with $121.23 and $1,755.30 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities advanced 8.5 percent this year to the highest
level in six months as measured by the Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI
index of 24 raw materials. Prices climbed as the U.S. economy
strengthened and the Chinese central bank cut reserve
requirements. While Morgan Stanley is also bullish on gold, it
expects oil prices to decline in the first half as supply
recovers and demand slows, it said in a report Feb. 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With much of the &#8216;value&#8217; opportunities behind us, we look
to fundamental drivers for further expected gains in 2012, which
we believe will be centered in the oil complex,&#8221; said Goldman.
Oil climbed to a nine-month high in New York yesterday after
Greece won a second bailout. Gold advanced 12 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank is bullish on oil because the price is vulnerable
to supply disruptions from Iran and elsewhere and OPEC spare
capacity is &#8220;at a trough&#8221; just as the world economic recovery
is gaining momentum, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Iran, China &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union agreed last month to ban crude imports
from Iran starting July 1 to increase pressure on the country
over its nuclear program. The Middle Eastern country said Feb.
19 it stopped selling crude to France and Britain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent for April delivery fell 0.4 percent to $121.23 in
London today and gold for the same month in New York declined
0.2 percent to $1,755.30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing in China, the biggest consumer of energy and
industrial metals, may shrink for a fourth month in February,
indicating the economy remains vulnerable to a deeper slowdown
as Europe&#8217;s crisis caps exports and the home market cools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preliminary 49.7 reading of an index from HSBC Holdings
Plc and Markit Economics today compared with a final 48.8 in
January. A number below 50 signals a contraction. January and
February economic data are distorted by a weeklong holiday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chinese construction activity and consumer appliance
output remain relatively weak,&#8221; the Goldman analysts said.
&#8220;Recent fundamental developments leave us happy to stay on the
sidelines&#8221; of industrial metals for now, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank predicts copper and aluminum at $9,000 a ton and
$2,400 a ton in 12 months compared with $8,421.50 and $2,257 now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysts see &#8220;little outright opportunity&#8221; in
agriculture, predicting lower prices in wheat and corn in 12
months and a 2 percent gain in soybeans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A U.S. trade agency said it needs
more time to decide whether to review a judge&#8217;s findings that
Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. (MMI) infringed one Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)
patent and not six others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. International Trade Commission said today it will
announce its decision March 2. It gave no reason for the delay
in a notice posted on its website. The agency has the power to
block imports of products found to violate U.S. patent rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility, being bought by Google Inc. (GOOG), was accused
of infringing seven Microsoft patents, a charge it denies. ITC
Judge Theodore Essex sided with Motorola Mobility on six of the
seven patents. The six-member commission can uphold the judge,
modify his decision or overturn him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s case against Motorola Mobility is In the Matter

&lt;p&gt;Chevron (CVX) Phillips Chemical Co., a
joint venture of Chevron Corp. and ConocoPhillips (COP), is studying
whether to build an ethylene-cracking plant on the U.S. Gulf
Coast to process natural gas from shale fields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The facility would &#8220;capitalize on advantaged feedstock
sourced from emerging shale-gas developments,&#8221; San Ramon,
California-based Chevron said in a U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission filing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chemical company initially announced the feasibility
study for a $5 billion cracker near Houston that would begin
operations in 2017. A surfeit of gas from U.S. shale formations
has pushed prices for the commodity to a 10-year low, prompting
companies including Royal Dutch Shell Plc to pursue new cracker
developments from the Appalachians to Texas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s
second-most valuable company, sued dozens of insurers in New
York state court to recover money for asbestos lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil producer filed the lawsuit yesterday against some
underwriters at Lloyd&#8217;s of London and other insurers, seeking a
declaration of their &#8220;rights, duties and obligations&#8221; to cover
Exxon Mobil&#8217;s defense costs and indemnify the company for money
it&#8217;s obligated to pay as a result of asbestos claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The claims arise from alleged exposure during several
decades to asbestos-containing materials at facilities owned by
Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp., and Mobil&#8217;s manufacture and
distribution of asbestos-containing products from 1963 until
about 1980, according to the filing. Exxon bought Mobil in 1999
for $85.2 billion in stock and assumed debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Claims by thousands of plaintiffs against Exxon Mobil
have been settled or otherwise disposed of,&#8221; the Irving, Texas-
based company said in the complaint. &#8220;Thousands more remain
pending against Exxon Mobil, and Exxon Mobil expects many more
to be filed in the future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lloyd&#8217;s of London declined to comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. is the world&#8217;s biggest company by market value. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genel Energy Plc (GENL), the oil explorer
focused on northern Iraq, won&#8217;t buy fellow Kurdistan producers
Gulf Keystone Petroleum Plc or DNO International ASA (DNO) because the
entry of Exxon Mobil Corp. into the region has forced up prices,
Chief Executive Officer Tony Hayward said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genel, the largest oil producer in Kurdistan, will seek to
expand outside the region, acquiring prospects in the Middle
East or Africa, Hayward told journalists in London today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kurdistan regional government said Nov. 13 that Exxon
had signed contracts to drill in the semi-autonomous region.
Since then shares of Gulf Keystone have doubled and DNO is up 23
percent. Genel President Mehmet Sepil said as recently as
November that the company would approach DNO about a merger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s too expensive for us,&#8221; Hayward said. &#8220;What changed
is Exxon coming in. We don&#8217;t need any more Kurdistan.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genel fell 1 percent to 821 pence in London. DNO fell 0.5
percent, and Gulf Keystone closed up 0.9 percent at 368 pence
after earlier rising as much as 8.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genel can fund its exploration and drilling programs with
cash flow from current production in Kurdistan, which it mostly
sells in the domestic market, Hayward said. The company still
has $1.9 billion to use for acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operations will produce as much as $300 million in revenue
this year, Hayward said before giving a presentation to
investors. Current production generates enough cash to fund
exploration, appraisal and development in Kurdistan, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explorer would considering buying fields or companies
involved in offshore exploration in east or west Africa, Hayward
said. Acquisitions may include the purchase of companies, assets
and licenses as Genel seeks geographic diversity, more
exploration potential and technical capability, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genel plans to lift production from the Taq Taq field to
about 200,000 barrels a day in 2014 from 66,000 barrels in 2011.
The company will also build a 255-kilometer (160 mile) pipeline
to the main Kirkuk-Ceyhan export line. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s Luca Ferrari, an investment banker to Xstrata Plc (XTA) on its proposed
merger with Glencore International Plc, is leaving the company
after 12 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferrari, a managing director based in London and head of
Northern European MA at the firm, joined from UBS Warburg in
2000. He was named a partner in 2006, according to an internal
memo seen by Bloomberg News and confirmed by a spokeswoman in
London today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His exit is the third by a senior banker in the investment
bank this month. Goldman Sachs said that George Mattson, head of
the industrials investment-banking group, was leaving the firm.
Jeffrey Moslow, a partner based in New York, will also leave the
company according to a memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferrari&#8217;s clients have included Telefonica SA, Spain&#8217;s
largest telephone company. New York-based Goldman Sachs is the
top ranked merger adviser this year, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glencore (GLEN), the world&#8217;s largest publicly traded commodity
trader, plans to combine with Xstrata&#8217;s coal and copper mines to
create a business with $209 billion in sales, the companies said
on Feb. 7. The takeover would be the biggest-ever mining deal if
completed and would form a commodities supplier to challenge BHP
Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto Group. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. (MMI) said
it is open to resolving its patent-licensing dispute with
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) in a &#8220;mutually beneficial manner&#8221; after
Microsoft filed an antitrust complaint with the European
Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s filing, and a related blog post, were &#8220;simply
tactics in the patent battle that Microsoft initiated with
surprise infringement actions against Motorola Mobility in
October 2010,&#8221; Gemma Goatly, a spokeswoman for Libertyville,
Illinois-based Motorola Mobility, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission said yesterday that it received
complaints from Microsoft concerning Motorola Mobility and
Google Inc. (GOOG) Microsoft said the actions were in response to
attempts by Motorola to block sales of personal computers and
game consoles that run its software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We just received the complaint and we are looking into
this,&#8221; Joaquin Almunia, the EU&#8217;s competition chief told
reporters today in Brussels. &#8220;These patent issues are very
important.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, said Google, which
is buying Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, was included in
the complaint because it hadn&#8217;t committed to change Motorola
Mobility&#8217;s policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft has touted the value of patent licensing for
its own patents, but a fair resolution requires that Microsoft
also recognize the value of the Motorola Mobility patents it is
using,&#8221; Goatly said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Samsung, Apple &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility, Microsoft, Samsung Electronics Co. and
Apple Inc. (AAPL) are involved in numerous patent lawsuits in Europe as
demand for smartphones and tablets soar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple has filed a patent-licensing complaint against
Motorola Mobility with the European Commission. The commission
is also probing Samsung over whether it broke licensing
commitments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether Microsoft&#8217;s filing is grouped together with Apple&#8217;s
for consideration by EU antitrust officials depends on the
&#8220;substance of each one of the complaints,&#8221; Almunia said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lithuania&#8217;s planned nuclear power
plant will cost as much as $6.5 billion, making it the biggest
investment in the Baltic country since independence from the
Soviet Union 22 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithuania plans to control 34 percent of the plant, while
Estonia, Latvia and Poland would each take a 20 percent stake,
with the remaining 6 percent paid by companies leasing the
atomic technology, Vytautas Nauduzas, a Lithuanian ambassador
for energy and transport policy, said yesterday in an interview
in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Baltic region is seeking to cut its dependence on
energy imports from Russia after closing the Soviet-era Ignalina
facility at the end of 2009. Lithuania is planning to build the
new 1,300-megawatt reactor in Visaginas by 2020 together with
Latvia and Estonia and Hitachi Ltd. (6501), a strategic investor in the
facility and Japan&#8217;s second-largest builder of nuclear reactors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PGE (PGE) SA, Poland&#8217;s largest utility, dropped plans to invest
in the new reactor to instead focus on other projects, the
Warsaw-based company said Dec. 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Polish government hasn&#8217;t pulled out officially and
Japanese banks might make up the shortfall should Poland abandon
the project, Nauduzas said today in a subsequent interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Participation by Poland is a little confusing at the
moment,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese financial institutions have confirmed their
interest to provide credit for the project, Arvydas Sekmokas,
Lithuania&#8217;s Energy Minister, said today in a radio interview
with Ziniu Radijas, the national broadcaster, without providing
names. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hitachi expects to sign the final contract to begin
constructing the atomic plant this year, it said in December.
The reactor will be built by Hitachi-GE Nuclear Energy Ltd., a
joint venture with General Electric Co. Hitachi offered its
advanced boiling water reactor technology with a proposed
capacity of 1,300 megawatts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power production costs at Visaginas may average 7 centai
($0.03) to 10 centai per kilowatt hour, lower than current costs
in the country, Sekmokas said on Feb. 15. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. (MMI) said
it is open to resolving its patent-licensing dispute with
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) in a &#8220;mutually beneficial manner&#8221; after
Microsoft filed an antitrust complaint with the European
Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s filing, and a related blog post, were &#8220;simply
tactics in the patent battle that Microsoft initiated with
surprise infringement actions against Motorola Mobility in
October 2010,&#8221; Gemma Goatly, a spokeswoman for Motorola
Mobility, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission said yesterday that it received
complaints from Microsoft concerning Motorola Mobility and
Google Inc. (GOOG) Microsoft said the actions were in response to
attempts by Motorola to block sales of personal computers and
game consoles that run its software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said Google, which is buying Libertyville,
Illinois-based Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, was included
in the complaint because it hadn&#8217;t committed to change Motorola
Mobility&#8217;s policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft has touted the value of patent licensing for
its own patents, but a fair resolution requires that Microsoft
also recognize the value of the Motorola Mobility patents it is
using,&#8221; Goatly said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility, Microsoft, Samsung Electronics Co. and
Apple Inc. (AAPL) are involved in numerous patent lawsuits in Europe as
demand for smartphones and tablets soar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple has filed a patent-licensing complaint against
Motorola Mobility with the European Commission. The commission
is also probing Samsung over whether it broke licensing
commitments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elpida Memory Inc. (6665) rose the most in
five months in Tokyo trading after filings showed Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) and Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) each own more than 5
percent of the world&#8217;s third-largest memory chip maker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elpida jumped 13 percent, the most since Sept. 13, to 349
yen at the close of trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Japan&#8217;s
benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average added 0.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs-related companies own a combined 6.07 percent
of Elpida, according to a regulatory filing to Japan&#8217;s finance
ministry yesterday. Credit Suisse Group companies held a 5.11
percent stake in the Tokyo-based chipmaker, another filing
showed. Elpida faces an April deadline to repay 92 billion yen
($1.1 billion) in debt and said Feb. 14 there was
&#8220;uncertainty&#8221; about its future, after saying Feb. 2 it
expected to secure financing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The stock&#8217;s volatility is getting high, especially after
it reversed its statement about the ability to repay loans,&#8221;
Yuichi Ishida, a Tokyo-based analyst at Mizuho Investors
Securities Co., said today by phone. Ishida has a &#8220;neutral
plus&#8221; rating on the company&#8217;s stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elpida said Feb. 14 it wasn&#8217;t able to reach a deal with
Japan&#8217;s government and its main lenders to get financing for
debt due in April. Japan Credit Rating, the only company that
grades its bonds, cut the company one level to the lowest
investment score of BBB- the same day and put it on a
&#8220;negative&#8221; outlook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chip Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chipmaker&#8217;s ability to repay the 92 billion yen in
bonds and loans by the deadline has been eroded by slumping chip
prices and five straight quarters of losses. Elpida is Japan&#8217;s
biggest maker of dynamic random access memory, the most common
chip used in computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elpida, Hynix Semiconductor Inc. and other makers of DRAM
chips lost a combined $14 billion in the past three years,
according to Bloomberg calculations. The price of the benchmark
DDR3 2-gigabit DRAM, which plunged to a record low of 71 cents
in November, fell 57 percent to 91 cents in the past year amid
slowing personal-computer sales, according to Taiwan-based
DRAMeXchange, Asia&#8217;s biggest spot market for the chips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elpida lost 62 percent of its market value last year,
extending a 37 percent slump in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Jody Shenn and Esteban Duarte" date="Feb 23, 2012 12:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-23/jpmorgan-wagers-72-billion-on-global-home-loans-in-yield-hunt-mortgages.html"><headline>JPMorgan Places $72 Billion Bet on Global Homeowners</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) has more than
tripled its holdings of mortgage securities without U.S.
government guarantees to $72 billion as the nation&#8217;s biggest
bank bets on borrowers from outside the country it calls home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investments swelled $8.4 billion in the fourth quarter,
climbing from $52.8 billion at the end of 2010 and $19 billion
the prior year, according to regulatory data released last week.
The bank has primarily been adding debt from outside the U.S.,
including bonds tied to U.K. and Dutch mortgages, Securities and
Exchange Commission filings by New York-based JPMorgan show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The bet is they can get a little more yield in areas
where they think that they&#8217;re safe,&#8221; said Jim Leonard, an
analyst at Morningstar Inc. in Chicago who covers the bank&#8217;s
debt. While mortgage bonds carry a stigma after fueling the
worst financial crisis since the 1930s, &#8220;that can be a little
unfair&#8221; because many were repaid in full, he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon added the
securities even as U.K. economic growth slows toward zero, the
Dutch property market slumps for a third year and Europe&#8217;s
leaders try to stem the region&#8217;s sovereign-debt crisis. The bank
may be benefiting as bailed-out lenders such as Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc (RBS) and ING Groep NV (INGA) are forced to contract, said
Brad Golding, managing director at Christofferson, Robb  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All of those guys want to shrink their balance sheets,&#8221;
said Golding, whose New York-based hedge fund manages about $1.4
billion and invests in financial-company credit. At the same
time, the U.S. Federal Reserve&#8217;s &#8220;massive&#8221; buying of
government-backed mortgage bonds has made those securities
relatively less attractive by pushing down yields, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a spokesman for JPMorgan, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contrasting Strategy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lender&#8217;s buying contrasts with the rest of the biggest
U.S. banks. Competitors are trimming holdings of so-called non-
agency mortgage bonds such as U.S. subprime securities that
sparked the housing meltdown, and expanding portfolios of agency
notes guaranteed by government-supported Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac or U.S.-owned Ginnie Mae. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan last year shrunk its investments in U.S. agency
mortgage securities by $28.1 billion to $134.7 billion,
according to data compiled by SNL Financial, a Charlottesville,
Virginia-based financial-information and research provider. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the top-25 banks, including Bank of America
Corp. (BAC) and Citigroup Inc. (C), increased their agency portfolios by
$121.1 billion to $947.8 billion as their non-agency investments
fell $31.6 billion to $98.6 billion, according to data assembled
by SNL from regulatory reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Net Interest Margin &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While banks are benefiting from record low costs being paid
on deposits, they&#8217;re facing a squeeze on net interest margins.
That&#8217;s the difference between what they pay to borrow money and
what they get for loans and on securities. JPMorgan&#8217;s margin
narrowed to 2.7 percent last quarter from 2.88 percent a year
earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed, while holding its target for short-term interest
rates near zero, has contributed to depressing yields by buying
bonds to support the economy. It bought $1.25 trillion of agency
mortgage securities from January 2009 through March 2010 and in
October started to use proceeds from the holdings to buy more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan purchased 1.28 billion euros ($1.7 billion) of
top-rated bonds backed by Dutch home loans from Amsterdam-based
ING in November, according to a person with knowledge of the
deal. It also bought part of a $5.5 billion offering in October
tied to U.K. loans originated by RBS and National Westminster
Home Loans, said a banker familiar with that transaction. They
declined to be identified because terms weren&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Taxpayer Money &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ING, the biggest Dutch financial-services firm, sold its
U.S. online bank last week to McLean, Virginia-based Capital One
Financial Corp. as a condition of its government bailout, while
RBS is shrinking after an injection of 45.5 billion pounds
($71.3 billion) of taxpayer money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the RBS deal, JPMorgan bought top-rated debt with a
projected average life of 2.8 years, according to one of the
people. The bonds sold at yields that are 1.6 percentage points
more than the three-month London interbank offered rate, a
floating benchmark set yesterday at 0.49 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These types of bond investments can address the &#8220;two
problems money managers are facing right now -- the fear of
higher rates and the absolute low level of rates,&#8221; said John Kerschner, head of securitized products at Janus Capital Group
Inc., which manages about $160 billion of assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fannie Mae Yields &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While yields on newly issued Fannie Mae mortgage securities
averaged 3.18 percent in October, the debt&#8217;s expected life was
more than two years longer than the RBS notes and can extend as
homeowner refinancing drops, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That leaves investors more exposed to the risk of
rising interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on slices of repackaged agency mortgage debt that
protect investors from higher rates by limiting maturities
averaged 1.22 percent in October, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch&#8217;s 0-3 Year PAC Agency CMO index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had $2.27 trillion of assets as of Dec. 31, up
from $2.12 trillion a year earlier. Securities holdings,
excluding trading assets, climbed $48.5 billion to $364.8
billion, and loans rose $30.8 billion to $723.7 billion as the
economic recovery slowed, limiting demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank held $57.5 billion of residential-mortgage
securities tied to loans outside the U.S. and $2.3 billion of
bonds backed by so-called prime and Alt-A (BBMDADLQ) U.S. loans on Sept. 30
in the available-for-sale accounting designation, according to
an SEC filing. Under that category, changes in the values aren&#8217;t
reflected in earnings. The prime and Alt-A investments were down
from almost $7 billion at the end of 2008, while the non-U.S.
mortgage debt rose from $2.1 billion, an earlier filing showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unrealized Losses &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank had unrealized losses of $530 million on those
overseas bonds, &#8220;substantially all&#8221; of which stemmed from
securities with ratings of AAA, AA or A from the U.K. and
Netherlands, according to its third-quarter filing, the most
recent available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its portions of the deals can withstand losses of about 10
percent on the underlying mortgages because other classes will
take writedowns first. JPMorgan said it projects lifetime losses
of 1.5 percent. The so-called credit enhancement on the U.K.
bonds it bought in October was 22.4 percent of losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home prices in the U.K. fell 1.8 percent in the last 12
months, while unemployment is at 8.4 percent, the highest rate
for 16 years, according to Halifax and government data. A push
to balance the U.K.&#8217;s finances probably will reduce growth to
0.5 percent this year from 0.9 percent in 2011, according to the
median forecast of economists compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Financial Crisis &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dutch house prices retreated 3.3 percent in the past year,
while the unemployment rate jumped last month to 6 percent, the
highest since February 2006, according to government figures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mortgage bonds outside the U.S. held up better during the
global economic slowdown that deepened after Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.&#8217;s 2008 collapse. Standard  Poor&#8217;s downgraded
almost 48 percent of U.S. residential securities in 2008 and
71.7 percent in 2009, compared with 6.1 percent and 15.3 percent
for their European equivalents, the rating company&#8217;s data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of securities backed by new U.S. home loans without
government backing have failed to rebound, with less than $1.5
billion of deals since mid-2008 after a record $1.2 trillion in
each of 2005 and 2006, according to Bloomberg data and
newsletter Inside Mortgage Finance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issuance of European home-loan bonds totaled 196 billion
euros last year, compared with 269 billion euros in 2006,
according to JPMorgan data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks including JPMorgan are also struggling to find non-
agency U.S. securities that might offer higher yields while
carrying investment-grade ratings, which Morningstar&#8217;s Leonard
said appeal to the lenders because they can set aside less
capital than for lower-rated debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The opportunities are relatively limited,&#8221; said Jason Callan, the head of structured products at Columbia Management
Investment Advisers LLC in Minneapolis, which oversees about
$170 billion in fixed-income. &#8220;Oftentimes, investment-grade
bonds work their way into bank or insurance-company portfolios,
which rarely trade out of those positions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highest U.S. oil production in
nine years is failing to dissuade Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) from
predicting that the price of the country&#8217;s most-traded crude
will keep climbing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank says West Texas Intermediate will
gain 7 percent by August to trade within $5 a barrel of North
Sea Brent, even as rising output swells the nation&#8217;s inventories.
Citigroup Inc. (C) takes the opposite view, forecasting that WTI&#8217;s
discount to Brent may widen to $20 a barrel this year, from
about $15.79 yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a danger in trading the Brent-WTI spread right
now with any strong fundamental conviction,&#8221; Olivier Jakob,
managing director at Petromatrix GmbH, a Zug, Switzerland-based
oil researcher, said in a phone interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outlook for WTI is being clouded by a deluge of oil to
Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for WTI futures, amid a
production boom that has cut America&#8217;s dependence on imports to
a more than-10-year low. The logjam is likely to be relieved in
June, when flows through the Seaway pipeline are reversed,
giving producers in Canada and North Dakota direct access to
refineries on the Gulf coast, according to Goldman Sachs, which
correctly forecast Brent would decline in April last year and
recover the following month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude oil for April delivery rose as much as 0.8 percent
to $108.70 a barrel in electronic trading today on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, bringing its gain this year to 9.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent oil for April settlement increased as much as 0.5
percent to $124.28 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange
in London, an advance of 15 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seaway Flows &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The spread between WTI and Brent will narrow with the
reversal of the Seaway pipeline,&#8221; David Greely, the New York-
based head of energy research at Goldman Sachs, said in a report
on Feb. 22. &#8220;With the Seaway flowing from Cushing to the U.S.
Gulf Coast, we expect WTI prices will be closely tied to Brent 
prices, with WTI likely trading at a $3 to $5 discount.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WTI&#8217;s discount to Brent widened to a record $27.88 on Oct.
14 last year as U.S. oil shale production boosted supplies to
Cushing while the uprising against Muammar Qaddafi choked off
exports from Libya, driving up the European benchmark grade. The
average in the past nine years is $1.33. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forward curves, which show monthly futures prices through
to the end of the decade for the two grades, currently indicate
that WTI will remain below Brent until at least 2020, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. oil production rose 3 percent last year to an average
of about 5.65 million barrels a day, the highest level since
2003, according to Energy Department data. Output will grow a
further 61 percent to 9.1 million barrels a day in 2015, the
most since the 1970s, Raymond James  Associates said in a
report on Feb. 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Not Keeping Pace&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The U.S. is choking on crude,&#8221; Seth Kleinman, the global
head of energy research at Citigroup in London, said in a phone
interview. &#8220;There are points where the infrastructure build-out
is just not keeping pace. Can Seaway clean up Cushing? Seaway
can tighten the arbitrage, possibly, in the short-term. But in
2013, there&#8217;s going to be another 500,000 to 800,000 barrels a
day of oil.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the new North American oil production &#8220;will remain
landlocked, and therefore heavily discounted,&#8221; Kleinman said in
a Feb. 15 report. Infrastructure won&#8217;t catch up until &#8220;mid-
decade at the earliest, and perhaps not until much later.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD) and Enbridge Inc. (ENB) said on
Nov. 16 that they would reverse flows through the 500-mile (805-
kilometer) Seaway link from June. That may initially divert
150,000 barrels a day out of the region, and then as much as
400,000 a day early next year, helping to clear the surplus that
has depressed WTI in relation to Brent, Goldman Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The risk-reward over the next several months favors a
long position in the WTI contracts following the reversal of the
Seaway pipeline,&#8221; Greely said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mergers and acquisitions may
increase in 2012 as the euro area&#8217;s debt crisis wanes, Dorothee Blessing, a partner at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) in Germany, was
quoted as saying in an interview with Die Welt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After European governments and the European Central Bank
took steps to stem the crisis, the months ahead will be decisive
for stabilizing the economic outlook, the Berlin-based newspaper
quoted Blessing as saying in comments published today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Oliver Suess" date="Feb 26, 2012  6:01 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-26/goldman-fights-unicredit-for-prized-oktoberfest-conference-slot.html"><headline>Goldman Fights for Prized Oktoberfest Conference</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will spar
with UniCredit SpA (UCG) over steins of Bavarian beer this autumn as
they jostle to lure German equity investors to rival conferences
in Munich during Oktoberfest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When UniCredit quit its western European equities business
on Nov. 14, Italy&#8217;s largest bank took another month to confirm
that it would team up with Kepler Capital Markets SA to continue
the annual conference it started in 2003. Both Goldman, along
with partner Berenberg Bank, and Baader Bank AG (BWB) had in the
meantime announced similar events, leaving investors with three
ways to spend their days before heading for the beer tents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman and Berenberg as well as Baader have obviously
opportunistically jumped on this fixed conference date in
people&#8217;s diary in the wrong expectation that we would no longer
host the conference,&#8221; said Christian Steffens, UniCredit&#8217;s co-
head of global capital markets. &#8220;People have always enjoyed
coming to Munich for the conference, as it is a nice place to
be, especially during the Oktoberfest.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first Oktoberfest was held in 1810 to honor Bavarian
Crown Prince Ludwig&#8217;s marriage to Princess Therese von Sachsen-
Hildburghausen. This year&#8217;s festival, which runs from Sept. 22
through Oct. 7, will attract about 6 million revelers to the
tents and halls set up by local breweries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Economic Strength &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More important for the conference organizers is that
Germany, Europe&#8217;s largest economy, continues to buck a recession
that&#8217;s gripping the region&#8217;s southern countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At the moment the whole world is looking at Germany,&#8221;
said Benon Janos, a Frankfurt-based managing director at
Goldman, who is in charge of the conference in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman and Hamburg-based Berenberg start their three-day
&#8220;German Corporate Conference 2012&#8221; on Sept. 24, one day before
their rivals. They have invited more than 100 companies,
according to Janos, and 800 institutional investors are expected
to attend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Until now, we didn&#8217;t have such an event and we wanted to
keep this conference in Munich alive,&#8221; said Janos. &#8220;We will
deliver a very good event this year, next year and the year
after that and then we will see.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UniCredit and Kepler, the French securities firm that now
provides research on stocks in western Europe to the Italian
bank&#8217;s customers, expect more than 100 company representatives
and about 700 investors to attend their three-day conference,
starting Sept. 25, said Steffens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hiring Organizers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baader Bank, the German securities brokerage that is
expanding its capital markets offerings, will invite investors
to Munich&#8217;s BMW-Welt venue on the same days as the UniCredit
event. Baader, based in Unterschleissheim near Munich, has hired
Oliver Riedel, Karin Brinkmann and other people who previously
helped arrange the event at UniCredit, said Nico Baader, a
member of the management board and son of founder Uto Baader. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, 70 companies have confirmed their attendance and
the bank is targeting 500 to 600 participants, Baader said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We provide a broad range from blue chips to small caps
and, uniquely, Austrian companies as well,&#8221; said Baader.
&#8220;We&#8217;re not here to do this once.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While for us, as a Munich-based investor, the Oktoberfest
isn&#8217;t as much as an attraction as maybe for U.S. investors, we
don&#8217;t mind so much having three conferences on exactly the same
topic simultaneously,&#8221; said Stefan Degen, who helps manage
about 36 billion euros ($48 billion) as head of equities at
BayernInvest, the asset manager owned by Bayerische Landesbank (BLGZ)
in Munich. &#8220;We will simply decide where the most interesting
presentations are being offered.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Starting to Rebuild &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UniCredit and Kepler will have to battle to attract
participants after losing sales people to Baader and other
rivals, said Degen. &#8220;Kepler is just starting to rebuild those
relationships,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UniCredit can overcome the loss, said Steffens. Linking up
with Kepler has added about 2,000 investor contacts from France,
Spain, Benelux, Scandinavia and the U.S., he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re confident that this year&#8217;s conference will become
even broader in terms of investor participation than last
year&#8217;s, when we counted 591 investors,&#8221; Steffens said
&#8220;Companies want to see investors from all over the world at
such a conference and we have the track record of being able to
attract them to Munich.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some companies and investors, the choice will be easy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will attend the Goldman/Berenberg conference as we
haven&#8217;t been invited by the others, which don&#8217;t cover our
stock,&#8221; said Claudia Gutjahr-Loeser, head of corporate
communications and investor relations at German biotechnology
company MorphoSys AG (MOR). &#8220;Generally it doesn&#8217;t make sense to try
to accommodate three conferences at the same time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Westlake Chemical Corp. (WLK) rose the
most in six weeks after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said a record
spread between oil and ethane will boost the plastics maker&#8217;s
earnings more than analysts&#8217; estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Westlake, based in Houston, rose 5.9 percent to $61.04 at
the close in New York, the biggest gain since Jan. 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Consensus estimates are failing to give Westlake enough
credit for the recent drop in ethane and the rise in oil
prices,&#8221; Brian Maguire, a Houston-based analyst at Goldman,
said in a report yesterday. &#8220;We expect Westlake&#8217;s first half
EPS to substantially exceed current expectations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price of Brent crude rose to a record 3.4 times U.S.
Gulf Coast ethane on an energy-equivalent basis, said Maguire.
Rising U.S. shale-gas output has depressed ethane prices,
lowering Westlake&#8217;s costs to make plastics. Resin prices are
poised to climb because of higher production costs in Europe and
Asia, where oil-derived naphtha is the main feedstock,  Maguire
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Westlake, which offered to buy vinyls maker Georgia Gulf
Corp (GGC) for $1.2 billion, gets the biggest earnings benefit from
the widening spread between ethane and oil, outpacing larger
rivals Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) and LyondellBasell Industries NV (LYB),
Maguire said. Westlake may earn $7 a share this year, 32 percent
more than analysts&#8217; estimate on average, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maguire, who rates the shares &#8220;buy,&#8221; added Westlake to
Goldman&#8217;s &#8220;Conviction&#8221; Buy List. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, has agreed to buy closely held Alacer Corp., which
makes dietary supplements including the vitamin C product
Emergen-C. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terms of the deal weren&#8217;t disclosed by New York-based
Pfizer, which plans to divest its nutritional and animal health
units. Alacer, based in Foothill Ranch, California, makes about
500 million packets of the vitamin powder each year, Pfizer said
today in a statement announcing the deal. A 30-pack of Emergen-C
sells for $9.99 on the drugstore Walgreen Co. (WAG)&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Emergen-C products add to and greatly complement our
market-leading dietary supplement portfolio,&#8221; Paul Sturman,
president of Pfizer Consumer Healthcare, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brand will become part of Pfizer&#8217;s consumer health-care
business, which was acquired with the 2009 purchase of Wyeth.
The unit made up 4.5 percent of Pfizer&#8217;s 2011 revenue in 2011.
Pfizer&#8217;s dietary supplements line has more than $1 billion in
sales, and the largest product is the Centrum brand
multivitamin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Pfizer rose less than 1 percent to $21.26 at the
close in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2011, Pfizer bought Danish vitamins company Ferrosan
from Altor Equity Partners AB, a private equity fund, for an
undisclosed amount. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) plans to bring its
Windows Phone software to 23 new countries and put the operating
system on less expensive smartphones, part of an effort to win
back market share lost to Google Inc. (GOOG) and Apple Inc. (AAPL) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will kick off the expansion by opening mobile-
application stores in China, Thailand, Venezuela and 20 other
nations by the end of the month, with phones arriving around the
same time, said Terry Myerson, who oversees the company&#8217;s
Windows Phone business. That will bring the total number of
markets Microsoft serves to 63, letting it target 60 percent
more buyers, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company aims to close ranks on Apple, the No. 2
provider of mobile-phone software, and set up a showdown with
Google&#8217;s market-leading Android operating system. While research
firm IDC has predicted that Microsoft will leapfrog Apple by
2015, moving up in the ranks won&#8217;t be easy, Myerson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I wish all I had to do is press a button and say, &#8216;Make
it happen,&#8217;&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got some great strategies to get
there, but it&#8217;s not a gimme. We&#8217;re a challenger in a market
against two established competitors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google and Apple aren&#8217;t as entrenched in emerging markets,
which provides an opportunity for Microsoft, said Al Hilwa, an
analyst at Framingham, Massachusetts-based IDC. Global
smartphone sales will top 1 billion units in 2015, with China as
the biggest single market, the research firm estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fleeting Chance &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Microsoft will have to move quickly in developing
economies, where cheaper Android phones are gaining a foothold,
Hilwa said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That opportunity may be fleeting in that we are seeing a
lot of Android phones come down to the low end,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;They need more phones, more carriers, more prices, more
languages.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also released a test version of its first Skype
video-calling application for Windows Phone today at the Mobile
World Congress show in Barcelona, Spain. The company plans to
have a final version available in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than make phones itself, Microsoft supplies its
software to Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) and other handset manufacturers. Those
partners are working on phones with Microsoft&#8217;s latest operating
system and showed off new models today at the Barcelona
conference. The company added app stores in Argentina,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Peru and the Philippines earlier this month
to help support the phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nokia Model &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia announced plans today to sell a Windows Phone priced
at 189 euros ($254) in the second quarter running on the new
software. That&#8217;s 30 percent less expensive than Nokia&#8217;s current
cheapest Windows Phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has adapted Windows Phone software so that it
requires half as much memory and runs the cheaper 7X27A chip
from Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) That should help manufacturers cut their
costs by about 30 percent to 40 percent, Myerson said. New
Windows Phones could cost as little as $100 to $200 to make. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., those savings are unlikely to be passed along
to consumers, Myerson said. In emerging markets, though, the
changes should lead to cheaper phone prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For Windows to be relevant and exciting to consumers in
these countries, we need to be at the price points they buy
consumer electronics at,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phones based on the new software and cheaper hardware are
slower for certain uses, Myerson said. A small number of apps
also aren&#8217;t yet running on the new products, though Microsoft is
working to fix that, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not in Love? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effort is particularly important in China, where many
phones cost about $100 to $150 to make, Myerson said. The
country is poised to pass the U.S. as the biggest smartphone
market this year, with Android ranking as the most popular
software, according to IDC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What Microsoft is counting on is there are a lot of
Android users, but there aren&#8217;t a lot of Android lovers,&#8221; said
Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Stamford, Connecticut-based
Gartner Inc. &#8220;They think they can convert those people.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also is working to persuade more carriers to
offer prepaid Windows Phones -- an approach that&#8217;s popular in
emerging markets. Myerson plans to discuss that topic this week
with America Movil SAB (AMX), the biggest mobile-phone carrier in the
Americas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, the new software won&#8217;t work on handsets that cost
less than $100 to make. Still, Microsoft might be able to
address that segment someday, Myerson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We want to maintain a consistent level of quality,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;In the fullness of time, price points come down.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank by assets, should consider breaking up and selling
businesses because its parts are worth one-third more than its
market value, according to Mike Mayo, an analyst at CLSA Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While JPMorgan&#8217;s stock has outperformed its peers, the New
York-based company has trailed the leading firms in its
individual businesses, Mayo wrote in a note e-mailed today.
JPMorgan executives must make the case at tomorrow&#8217;s investor
conference for why the firm shouldn&#8217;t be broken up, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At what point does the conglomerate discount become so
great that it encourages the company to take action?&#8221; Mayo
wrote. &#8220;The stock seems undervalued, but the question is how
and when this value gets realized?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank stocks including JPMorgan underperformed the broad
market over the past eight years, according to Mayo. Even after
this year&#8217;s 15 percent gain, the stock is worth about 2 percent
less than at the end of 2004. Mayo asked whether the firm run by
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon should sell its asset-
management and processing units, which accounted for 18 percent
of 2011 revenue, and use proceeds for share buybacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Eight years is a long time to wait for a higher share
price when the five top executives at JPM from 2004-2010
received over $600 million in compensation,&#8221; Mayo wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment
on the report. The stock gained 6 cents to $38.34 at 11:32 a.m.
in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s net income climbed 9 percent to $19 billion last
year as credit quality improved. Revenue dropped 5 percent to
$97.2 billion, the lowest since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If JPM is best-of-breed and it still underperforms,
perhaps the breed is not so good or the company needs to better
explain the synergies whose benefits are missing from the share
price,&#8221; Mayo wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), the largest U.S.
bank by market value, hired Eric Fornell from JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) to advise energy and power clients in the investment bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fornell, 56, joins as a vice chairman and will focus on
power and pipeline companies, San Francisco-based Wells Fargo
said today in a statement. He was most recently a vice chairman
at JPMorgan, where he worked since 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to JPMorgan, Fornell worked at Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and at CMS Enterprises Co., Wells Fargo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fornell &#8220;brings more than 30 years of well-rounded
experience in banking, MA and equities,&#8221; Rob Engel, a co-head
of investment banking at Wells Fargo, said in the statement.
Fornell is based in New York and will report to Engel and the
other co-head, Jonathan Weiss. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General Electric Co. (GE) and JP Morgan
Chase  Co. jointly purchased a minority stake in the Capricorn
Ridge wind farm in Texas for $225 million from NextEra Energy
Inc. (NEE) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GE, whose equipment generates more than a quarter of the
world&#8217;s power, has invested in 2,143 megawatts of wind farms in
Texas, about 20 percent of the state&#8217;s total installed wind
capacity, the Fairfield, Connecticut-based company said today in
a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 662.5-megawatt Capricorn Ridge wind farm, which began
operating in 2007, uses turbines produced by both GE and Siemens
AG (SIE) and can produce enough power for about 220,000 homes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will release a Skype
video-calling application for its Windows Phone marketplace,
aiming to use last year&#8217;s $8.5 billion acquisition of Skype
Technologies SA to boost the popularity of its mobile software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft plans to have the app available in April, Terry Myerson, head of the Redmond, Washington-based company&#8217;s mobile
business, said in an interview last week. It will unveil the
software today at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain,
and release a version for beta testers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft bought Skype to gain customers and enhance its
existing products -- such as Windows phones and Xbox game
consoles, along with Internet-calling and videoconferencing
software. Skype customers made more than 300 billion minutes of
calls last year, Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer
said in January. The service, which handles both voice and video
calls, is the top provider of international calling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows Phone has just 2 percent of the mobile operating-
system market, and lags behind Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. in
providing apps. Both those rivals already have Skype apps. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank by assets, said about 70 percent of customers with
less than $100,000 in deposits and investments will be
unprofitable following regulations that cap lenders&#8217; fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to give you a proxy for what the banking
industry has to look forward to if you don&#8217;t take into account
business bank clients and getting more of the affluent wealth
wallet,&#8221; Todd Maclin, chief executive officer of consumer and
business banking at the New York-based company, said today at an
investor presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. banks are grappling with lost revenue from
regulations that cap debit interchange fees and overdraft
charges, making customers with low deposits more expensive for
lenders to manage. JPMorgan, run by CEO Jamie Dimon, sees its
greatest opportunity with affluent customers that have more
relationships with the company, Maclin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Lost revenue has to be replaced with higher share of
wallet and customer penetration,&#8221; Maclin said. &#8220;You have to
get your costs and where you spend your time, to the fullest
extent possible, more in line with where the opportunity is.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said there is a &#8220;significant opportunity to
deepen affluent relationships&#8221; and a &#8220;limited opportunity to
deepen relationships&#8221; with customers who have less than
$100,000 in deposits and investments, according to slides at the
presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Better Customers&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will see banks pulling out of certain markets, looking
closely at where they have market share,&#8221; said Bert Ely, an
independent bank consultant based in Alexandria, Virginia. &#8220;If
you shrink the customer base too much, it will kill the bottom
line. You have to avoid the downward spiral where you try to
drive away customers and trim customers, and you lose your
better customers because they aren&#8217;t happy with what you&#8217;ve
done.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve has held interest rates at record lows,
putting pressure on profit margins as banks make less money from
deposits. The Fed has decided to keep the rates near zero
through at least late 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When you are in this interest-rate environment, retail
customers aren&#8217;t generating the interest income they used to,&#8221;
Ely said. &#8220;The low interest rates would have a negative impact
no matter what happens with regulations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bank of America &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEO Brian T. Moynihan of Bank of America Corp., the second-
biggest U.S. lender by assets, has said his strategy is to
broaden relationships with the lender&#8217;s 8 million so-called
preferred clients that are 1.5 times as profitable as the retail
group. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based company gives these
customers incentives such as removing monthly service fees on
checking accounts for using a Bank of America credit card,
mortgage or Merrill Lynch brokerage account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America abandoned a plan to charge some debit-card
users $5 a month for the service after JPMorgan and San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) decided against imposing
similar fees. Citigroup Inc. (C) and U.S. Bancorp (USB) had already
rejected the idea. Maclin said JPMorgan will implement &#8220;follow-
on pricing&#8221; for fees in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When the world lets us charge something more akin to your
gym membership or your card, we&#8217;ll be right there with them,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;In this environment, we&#8217;re just not going to rock
that boat, and we have a brand and a franchise where we can make
it up other ways over time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Regions Financial &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regions Financial Corp. (RF), the 10th-largest U.S. bank by
deposits, launched a fee-based service last year that provides
customers with money transfers, bill pay services, check cashing
and reloadable prepaid cards. Since the program started in July,
half of the customers who have started the service were existing
Regions clients and half were new, said John Owen, head of
consumer services group at the Birmingham, Alabama-based lender. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If I can start off by cashing their check or loading a
prepaid card, and then move them into traditional banking, which
means moving them into a savings account or checking account,
that&#8217;s what I want to do,&#8221; Owen said today in a phone
interview. &#8220;We&#8217;re trying to get more people into the banking
system.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regions &#8220;would love to&#8221; take on clients shunned by larger
banks, Owen said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll take all we can get in our 16-state
footprint,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maclin said it&#8217;s possible that fees for checking accounts
could reach $20 one day, which he said the bank would
&#8220;celebrate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Invaluable&#8217; Branches &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s branches are &#8220;invaluable&#8221; to its so-called
affluent customers, according to the presentation slides. The
company said it may open 900 &#8220;potential&#8221; new branch buildings
in 2012, especially in California, Florida and Atlanta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Branches are not that expensive relative to all the
opportunity and the other expenses that we have in running this
place, given our scale,&#8221; Maclin said. &#8220;We would acknowledge
with everybody else out there that it is entirely possible that
they could go away one day. If they do, we will make a lot more
money than we&#8217;re making right now. Until they do, we&#8217;re going to
make sure we&#8217;ve got them so no one else can take our location.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) said interest-
rate swaps and credit are among the biggest sources of revenue
in its trading businesses, as it broke with most U.S. rivals by
releasing a breakdown typically kept secret. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan generates $375 million from credit trading in a
&#8220;typical quarter&#8221; and $350 million each from interest-rate
swaps and foreign-exchange spot and futures trading, the New
York-based bank said today in a presentation to investors. Cash
equities produces about $325 million, while the bank gets $300
million a quarter from asset-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some European banks describe revenue from large units
within their trading divisions, U.S. banks rarely quantify the
makeup of their businesses, which generate about a quarter of
total revenue at the five largest Wall Street banks. JPMorgan
reported $20.2 billion in 2011 trading revenue, which on its own
would make it bigger than U.S. Steel Corp. (X) and Capital One
Financial Corp. (COF) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They are pulling up the hem of their skirt so we can see
a bit more leg,&#8221; said Gary Townsend, a founder of Hill-Townsend
LLC in Chevy Chase, Maryland, which owns shares of JPMorgan.
&#8220;They want to make sure the diversity of these operations is
well understood.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Net Income Target &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jes Staley, chief executive officer of JPMorgan&#8217;s
investment bank, said the bank provided the disclosure in order
to show the breadth of the businesses that contributed to market
share gains. The firm&#8217;s 17 percent market share in fixed-income
trading is probably a Wall Street record, he said. The trading-
revenue breakdown was included in slides accompanying his
presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bank is still targeting a 17 percent
return on equity, a measure of profitability, the documents
show. The unit had $467 billion of risk-weighted assets under
Basel 3 as of the fourth quarter and plans to cut that to $413
billion by the end of this year, giving the division a 9.5
percent Tier 1 common ratio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank seeks to eventually produce total net income of
about $24 billion, compared with a record $19 billion last year,
Chief Financial Officer Doug Braunstein said today in a separate
presentation, without specifying a target date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Revenue Per Trade &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While less than 0.2 percent of all client trades in the
fixed-income business produced more than $500,000 per
transaction, those accounted for about 25 percent of total
trading revenue. About 98 percent of client trades produced less
than $50,000 per trade in 2011, according to Staley&#8217;s
presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity swaps and options, which produce about $200 million
a quarter, had the highest revenue-per-trade of the products
listed, at $30,000. Interest-rate swaps produced $12,000 per
transaction, with about 30,000 trades per quarter. Foreign-
exchange spot and forwards generated $70 per trade, while North
American cash equities charged about 1.5 cents per share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s description of high-volume products didn&#8217;t
account for all of its trading revenue. JPMorgan reported an
average of $3.8 billion from trading in fixed-income products,
currencies and commodities, and $1.2 billion from equities over
the last four quarters. The product revenue listed in the
presentation totaled $2.3 billion in fixed-income and $675
million in equities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staley said the disclosure highlighted &#8220;about 70 percent&#8221;
of trading revenue. It excluded revenue tied to trading with
other banks, and also didn&#8217;t include other areas, such as
structured products, prime brokerage, and net interest income,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Volcker Rule &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s disclosure comes as banks say the proposed U.S.
Volcker rule, which seeks to bar banks from making bets with
their own money, threatens market-making operations and could
hurt liquidity in the marketplace. The breakdown is probably
aimed at informing regulators and may prompt similar moves from
competitors, Townsend said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve always had an idea as to what their product set is,
but it would be interesting to get more information that would
help make clear how penetrating JPMorgan is in a particular
product area compared to others,&#8221; Townsend said. &#8220;Maybe we&#8217;ll
get a better sense of that as time goes on.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has about 16,000 clients in its markets business,
according to the presentation. Asset managers accounted for 29
percent of 2011 trading revenue, while hedge funds provided 23
percent and banks 16 percent. More than half of trading revenue
came from North America, with one-third coming from the Europe,
Middle East and Africa region, and 10 percent coming from Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment bank employs 2,500 salespeople and 2,000
traders over more than 110 trading desks, the company said. It
also has 2,000 bankers, 800 research analysts, 4,000 control and
risk employees and 13,000 people working on technology and
operations, it said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon assailed the pay practices of the newspaper
industry today as he sought to deflect criticism of bank pay as
viewed through the compensation ratio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Obviously our business, in investment banking in
particular, all of our businesses, we have high capital and high
human capital,&#8221; Dimon said today at a presentation in New York,
where the bank is based. &#8220;Newspapers -- I went and got this one
day just for fun -- 42 percent payout ratio, which I just think
is just damned outrageous.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers and journalists have criticized bankers for the
size of their salaries and bonuses and regulators have blamed
compensation for fueling the financial crisis. Dimon, who runs
the biggest and most profitable U.S. bank, previously cited the
media industry during a January investor call in which he sought
to show why using compensation payout ratios is wrongheaded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan paid the 25,999 employees in the investment bank
an average of $341,552 last year, or about 34 percent of the
unit&#8217;s revenue, according to figures posted Jan. 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Worse than that, you don&#8217;t even make any money!&#8221; Dimon
said, directing his comments to those in the media covering the
company&#8217;s investor day and drawing laughter from his audience.
&#8220;We pay 35 percent. We make a lot of money.&#8221; JPMorgan posted
$19 billion in profit last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gannett Co., the McLean, Virginia-based media company that
produces 82 daily publications including USA Today, earned $518 million
last year. The stock has dropped 8.7 percent in the past year,
while JPMorgan has fallen 16 percent. Since the end of 2007,
Gannett is down 61 percent, while JPMorgan is off 10 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Newspapers do make money and they are still quite
profitable, many operating with double-digit margins,&#8221; said
Randy Bennett, a spokesman at the Newspaper Association of
America. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider, fired
more than 1,000 workers in North America this week, according to
an employee advocacy group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The job reductions are mostly in the U.S., with some in
Canada, said Lee Conrad, national coordinator of Alliance@IBM,
which has been trying to organize IBM employees. The group is
continuing to update the number as it receives severance
documents from workers notified with what IBM calls &#8220;resource
actions,&#8221; Conrad said. Redundant employees may apply for other
positions within IBM, the documents show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doug Shelton, a spokesman for Armonk, New York-based IBM,
declined to provide a number, citing company policy and the
&#8220;competitive nature of our business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cuts would represent about 0.2 percent of IBM&#8217;s global
workforce, which totaled 433,362 at the end of 2011, according
to the annual report filed today with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. The company stopped providing a geographic
breakdown of its employees in 2009. At the end of 2008, U.S.
staff accounted for 115,000 of its 398,455 employees, according
to its annual report that year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;IBM is constantly rebalancing its workforce,&#8221; Shelton
said today. &#8220;That means reducing in some areas and hiring in
others -- based on shifts in technology and client demand. This
allows IBM to remain competitive and relevant in an industry
that is constantly changing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM rose less than 1 percent to $197.98 at the close in New
York. The shares have gained 7.7 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alliance@IBM is affiliated with the Communications Workers
of America and is seeking union recognition at IBM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information Week reported yesterday that more than 250 jobs
had been cut at IBM. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Treasuries investors increased
bets to the highest level since December 2010 that the price of
the government debt will rise, a survey by JPMorgan Chase  Co.
showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The percent of &#8220;longs&#8221; in the firm&#8217;s &#8220;all clients&#8221;
survey rose to 26 percent for the week ending yesterday, up from
17 percent the previous week. The percent of net longs in the
survey rose to 13 percent from 2 percent the previous week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 60 percent of the clients surveyed were &#8220;neutral,&#8221;
the lowest level since March 2011 and down from 68 percent the
previous week. The survey showed the percent of so-called
&#8220;shorts&#8221; dropped to 13 percent from 15 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short position is a wager the price of a security will
fall, while a long position is a bet it will rise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasury prices have traded in a narrow range. After the
yield on the 10-year note touched a record low of 1.67 percent
on Sept. 23, it has traded as low as 1.79 percent this year and
as high as 2.09 percent. The 10-year yield traded at 1.92
percent today at 12:30 p.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan doesn&#8217;t disclose the number of clients in the
survey. Srini Ramaswamy, a JPMorgan strategist in New York,
wasn&#8217;t immediately available to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goodwin Procter LLP (1176L), the Boston-
based law firm, hired William J. Harrington, a Manhattan federal
prosecutor, for its expanding white-collar crime practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrington, 38, was an assistant U.S. attorney in the
criminal division of the Southern District of New York. He
assisted in the conviction of investment adviser Kenneth I. Starr, and the bribery conviction of former New York State
Senator Carl Kruger, Goodwin said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrington also served as the criminal health-care fraud
coordinator under U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in the Southern
District. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He will join Goodwin&#8217;s New York office as a member of its
white-collar crime and government investigations practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Bill has built a strong experience base and reputation
over the course of his work for the Southern District,&#8221; Mark E. Tully, partner and chairman of the firm&#8217;s litigation department,
said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodwin had revenue of $695.5 million in 2011, a
2.5 percent increase from the previous year, according to the
American Lawyer, a trade publication. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complaints by Apple Inc. (AAPL) and
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) against Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. (MMI) will be
examined &#8220;closely&#8221; by European Union regulators, the region&#8217;s
antitrust chief said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joaquin Almunia, the EU&#8217;s competition commissioner, said
competition policy must ensure essential patents aren&#8217;t &#8220;used
strategically to block competitors,&#8221; according to a speech at
the European Parliament in Brussels today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung Electronics Co. is facing an EU antitrust probe
into its licensing of patents to other mobile-phone
manufacturers. Samsung, Motorola Mobility, Microsoft and Apple
are involved in litigation across Europe as demand for
smartphones and tablets soars. Google Inc. (GOOG), which is buying
Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, has written to groups that
establish industry standards to assure them it will fairly
license the Libertyville, Illinois-based company&#8217;s patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To build a modern smart phone one needs thousands of
standard-essential patents,&#8221; Almunia said. &#8220;Any company that
holds these patents can effectively hold up the entire industry
with the threat of banning the products of competitors from the
market. This sort of hold-up is not acceptable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU antitrust regulators are separately investigating claims
Google discriminated against other services in its search
results and stopped some websites from accepting rival ads.
Microsoft and shopping-comparison site Foundem are among
companies that asked the agency to examine the Mountain View,
California-based search-engine firm&#8217;s practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Formal Complaint &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almunia said he expected investigators to give him a report
on the Google before the end of April and would decide after
that if a formal antitrust complaint was needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to receive information or complaints&#8221; on
Google and the company regularly updates its products and
services &#8220;so it&#8217;s not a simple task to investigate,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Al Verney, a spokesman for Google in Brussels, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which is examining
whether Google gives preference to its own services in search
results, is expanding its antitrust probe to include scrutiny of
Google+, according to two people familiar with the situation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. and a group of
investors that reached an $8.5 billion mortgage-bond settlement
with the bank won their bid to remove the case from a federal
judge and return it to state court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals in Manhattan overturned a lower
court ruling and granted a request by Bank of America and the
investor group to remand the case to New York state court, where
it was first filed, according to a decision yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The case was not removable from state court and must be
remanded,&#8221; the appeals court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement, which would resolve claims from investors
in Countrywide Financial Corp. mortgage bonds, was filed last
year in New York State Supreme Court and was initially set for
consideration at a November hearing. Before that hearing took
place, the case was removed to federal court by entities under
the name Walnut Place that own some of the securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision sending the case back to state court is good
for investors in Countrywide bonds because it reduces
uncertainty in the settlement, Barclays Capital said in a
research note after the decision. Bank of America acquired
Countrywide in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The move back to New York state court increases the
likelihood of the settlement going through and pushes the
timeline forward,&#8221; Barclays said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America along with the group of institutional
investors that negotiated the settlement, including BlackRock
Inc. (BLK), fought the transfer of the case to federal court and
argued the case belonged in state court. They were joined by
Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK), the mortgage bond trustee, which
sought approval for settlement in state court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased the jurisdictional issues have been
resolved and we can now move toward getting the settlement
approved,&#8221; Robert Madden, an attorney for the investor group,
said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawrence Grayson, a spokesman for Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America, said the lender looks forward to
completing the court proceeding to obtain approval for the
agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Heine, a spokesman for Bank of New York, and Owen
Cyrulnik, a lawyer for Walnut Place, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bank of New York Mellon v. Walnut Place LLC,
11-cv-05988, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News Corp. to Pay $950,000 to Pop Star Over Phone Hacking &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News Corp. (NWSA) agreed to pay 600,000 pounds ($952,000) to
Charlotte Church, the U.K. pop star, and admitted its News of
the World tabloid hacked her mobile-phone messages for &#8220;many
years,&#8221; starting when she was 16 years old. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a court hearing yesterday in London, News Corp. lawyers
said the company regularly harassed Church&#8217;s family, put them
under surveillance, hacked the phone of her father and acquired
details of her mother&#8217;s &#8220;complex medical history&#8221; and suicide
attempt to write scoops about the Welsh singer, now 26. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would have learned nothing more from an actual trial,
since it is clear that no one from News International was
prepared to take the stand to explain their actions,&#8221; Church
said in a statement referring to the company&#8217;s U.K. publishing
unit. &#8220;In my opinion, they are not truly sorry, only sorry that
they got caught.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of about 70 victims to sue News International, Church
settled last week, days before the first civil trial over the
scandal was to begin. The deal comes after a person familiar
with the matter, who isn&#8217;t authorized to speak about the case,
said Church&#8217;s agent in Los Angeles and publicist in New York
have been identified as the first potential American victims of
the tabloid&#8217;s hacking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Church and her parents, James and Maria, sued in December
after the Metropolitan Police showed them evidence the News of
the World&#8217;s ex-private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, who was
jailed for phone hacking, had intercepted their phone messages
as late as 2006 to write stories about them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Church, who sang at Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s wedding in 1999, when
she was 13, settled after News International&#8217;s lawyers told a
judge they would seek to question her mother about her mental
state during any trial to potentially reduce damages. As part of
the accord, News Corp. said it coerced Church&#8217;s mother into
giving an interview about her attempted suicide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Geoffrey Vos said he would set another deadline for
new phone-hacking victims to come forward and that a trial could
take place a year from now, if they don&#8217;t settle. News
International is making &#8220;superhuman efforts&#8221; to settle the
cases, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Church v. News Group Newspapers, High Court of
Justice Chancery Division, HC11C03393. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Amazon, Bookstore Group Settle Suit Over Advertising Claims &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and a trade group for college bookstores
settled a lawsuit over Amazon&#8217;s advertising for textbook
discounts, the group said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest online retailer was advertising discounts of 30
percent on new college textbooks and 90 percent on used ones. In
May, Amazon asked a federal court in Seattle, where the company
is based, to declare that its advertising wasn&#8217;t false or
misleading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon provided the methodology by which it substantiates
its savings claims to the National Association of College
Bookstores Inc., the group said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday. While not endorsing the methodology or the results
obtained, the trade group agreed there&#8217;s no current dispute
about the advertising claims, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon and the group agreed not to challenge each other
about the advertising claims for one year. The settlement didn&#8217;t
include an exchange of money, the group said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary Osako, spokeswoman for Amazon, didn&#8217;t immediately
return an e-mail message seeking comment about the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Amazon.com v. National Association of College
Stores Inc., 11-754, U.S. District Court, Western District of
Washington (Seattle). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;BBT Purchase of BankAtlantic Unit Barred by Delaware Judge &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BBT Corp. (BBT)&#8217;s purchase of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#8217;s primary
business unit was barred by a Delaware judge, who said the sale
would harm shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BankAtlantic shareholders including Hildene Capital
Management LLC sued in November after BBT announced it would
pay as much as $301 million to acquire BankAtlantic&#8217;s retail-
lending unit. The deal excludes Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based
BankAtlantic&#8217;s non-performing assets. Delaware Chancery Court
Judge J. Travis Laster said the transaction would trigger an
acceleration of debt that BankAtlantic wouldn&#8217;t be able to pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Because this eventuality will inflict irreparable harm on
the plaintiffs, I have entered contemporaneously an order
permanently enjoining Bancorp from consummating the sale,&#8221; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We need some time to review the ruling and will have a
comment later,&#8221; David White, a spokesman for Winston-Salem,
North Carolina-based BBT, said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives of BankAtlantic didn&#8217;t immediately return
voice and e-mail messages seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sealink Funding Bear Stearns Suit Moved to Federal Court &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sealink Funding Ltd.&#8217;s lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
over $2.4 billion in residential mortgage-backed securities was
moved to federal court from New York state court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sealink sued New York-based JPMorgan Chase and units
including Bear Stearns and EMC Mortgage LLC in September,
accusing them of making misrepresentations about the risks and
characteristics of the loans underlying securities bought
between 2005 and 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was moved to U.S. District Court in Manhattan
by the defendants because it&#8217;s related to federal bankruptcy
proceedings and because it involves a party outside the U.S.,
according to documents filed in New York State Supreme Court on
Feb. 24. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was one of several filed in New York state
court during the past six months over residential mortgage-
backed securities by Sealink, an Ireland-based fund created to
manage Landesbank Sachsen AG&#8217;s riskiest assets after the German
lender almost collapsed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sealink has also sued Bank of America Corp. (BAC)&#8217;s Countrywide
unit over $1.6 billion in securities and Morgan Stanley (MS) over
$556 million of the investments. The Countrywide case was moved
to federal court in October. Sealink said last week that it
intends to sue banks including Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
and Credit Suisse AG (CSGN) over $948.8 million in mortgage securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Sealink Funding Ltd. v. Bear Stearns  Co.
Inc., 652681/2011, New York State Supreme Court, New York
County, Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Apple Wins Temporary Ruling on German IPad, IPhone Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL) won a German appeals court ruling temporarily
blocking the enforcement of a patent verdict obtained by
Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. (MMI) in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility, which forced Apple to remove some iPad
and iPhone models from its German online store for a short
period, can&#8217;t enforce the verdict during an appeal. The ruling
was issued after the iPad maker revised license-agreement terms
it offered Motorola Mobility, the court said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At the current state of the proceedings, it is to be
assumed that Motorola Mobility would violate its duties under
antitrust rules if it continues to ask Apple to stop the
sales,&#8221; the court said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility, which is being acquired by Google Inc.,
and Apple are entangled in numerous patent disputes. Yesterday&#8217;s
case concerned a so-called standard essential patent that
companies must license to competitors because they can&#8217;t produce
the devices without the technology. Cupertino, California-based
Apple has also filed a complaint with the European Union
accusing Motorola Mobility of violating a pledge to license
industry-standard patents on fair terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple spokesman Alan Hely declined to comment. Motorola
Mobility&#8217;s press office didn&#8217;t immediately reply to an e-mail
seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s ruling helps Apple&#8217;s prospects in the appeals
case, which hinges on the terms Motorola Mobility must accept to
be forced to grant a license. In their December verdict the
Mannheim judges rejected Apple&#8217;s offer, saying it didn&#8217;t
adequately take Motorola Mobility&#8217;s interest into account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s case is OLG Karlsruhe, 6 U 136/11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Monsanto Wins Dismissal of Organic Growers&#8217; Gene-Patent Suit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monsanto Co. (MON), the world&#8217;s largest seed company, won the
dismissal of a lawsuit by growers of organic crops seeking to
have its patents for genetically altered seeds invalidated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald in Manhattan threw
out the organic growers&#8217; lawsuit in a ruling dated Feb. 24,
saying it represented no controversy and that she had no
jurisdiction over the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic farmers, seed companies and food safety groups sued
St. Louis-based Monsanto in March 2011 seeking court protection
against possible lawsuits by the company for patent infringement
if genetically modified crops were mistakenly found among their
yields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is no evidence that plaintiffs are infringing
defendants&#8217; patents, nor have plaintiffs suggested when, if
ever, such infringement will occur,&#8221; Buchwald wrote in her
opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growers, claiming that Monsanto &#8220;aggressively
asserted&#8221; its patent claims against hundreds of U.S. farmers,
sought a ruling from Buchwald that the patents for genetically
engineered seeds are invalid because they are &#8220;injurious.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They claimed transgenic seeds might contaminate their crops
and that they don&#8217;t want to have to fight Monsanto patent claims
should that occur. The company has pursued &#8220;baseless litigation
to intimidate farmers and restrict competition with its
transgenic seed,&#8221; according to the growers&#8217; complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Her decision to deny farmers the right to seek legal
protection from one of the world&#8217;s foremost patent bullies is
gravely disappointing,&#8221; Daniel Ravicher, a lawyer for the
plaintiffs, said in an e-mail. &#8220;Her belief that farmers are
acting unreasonable when they stop growing certain crops to
avoid being sued by Monsanto for patent infringement should
their crops become contaminated maligns the intelligence and
integrity of those farmers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ravicher said the plaintiffs will appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The ruling makes it clear that there was neither a
history of behavior nor a reasonable likelihood that Monsanto
would pursue patent infringement matters against farmers who
have no interest in using the company&#8217;s patented seed
products,&#8221; David Snively, Monsanto&#8217;s general counsel, said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Organic Seed Growers  Trade Association v.
Monsanto Co., 11-02163, U.S. District Court, Southern District
of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New Suits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Molycorp Board, Majority Holders Sued Over Stock Bubble &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molycorp Inc. (MCP)&#8217;s board was sued on the company&#8217;s behalf over
claims that it misled investors about the rare-earth market,
creating a &#8220;price bubble&#8221; for the shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molycorp&#8217;s directors and its controlling shareholders
Resource Capital Funds and Pegasus Capital Advisors devised a
scheme to temporarily inflate the stock&#8217;s value and then profit
by dumping more than $1 billion of their personal holdings into
the market in February, March and June of last year, according
to the complaint. The lawsuit, which was made public yesterday,
was filed by Arizona resident Ira Gaines, a trustee of Paradise
Wire  Cable Defined Benefit Plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directors falsely implied that Greenwood Village, Colorado-
based Molycorp could meet increasing worldwide demand of
critical rare earth elements, Gaines said in the complaint.
Directors also omitted that mining experts predict the light
rare earth elements the company may be able to produce this year
will be in oversupply in the next several years, fetching lower
prices, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Company insiders, including current board members and a
controlling group of shareholders, netted $1.6 billion in
secondary offerings, months before concerns arose about declines
in rare-earth prices and delays in construction at the company&#8217;s
Mountain Pass mine, Gaines said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim Sims, a spokesman for Molycorp, declined to comment
immediately when reached by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ross Bhappu, a partner for Denver-based Resource Capital
and Molycorp&#8217;s chairman, didn&#8217;t immediately return a phone call
seeking comment on the lawsuit. Officials at Pegasus didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Gaines v. Mark A. Smith, CA7282, Delaware
Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stanford Defense Rests Without Calling Financier to Testify &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R. Allen Stanford&#8217;s lawyers rested their defense without
calling their client to the witness stand in his criminal fraud
trial in Houston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the defense completed its case, prosecutors said they
had no rebuttal witnesses. U.S. District Judge David Hittner
told the jury to return to the courtroom on Feb. 29. Lawyers
will have two hours each for closing arguments and instructions
to the jury will take an hour, the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors have accused Stanford of running a $7 billion
investment fraud scheme and misleading investors about the
nature and oversight of certificates of deposit issued by his
Antigua-based Stanford International Bank Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford, 61, has maintained his organization had
sufficient holdings to repay investors and was in the midst of
consolidating its disparate entities when he and the bank were
sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in February
2009 and their assets seized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is United States v. Stanford, 09cr342, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lenders Must Be Named in Foreclosures, New Jersey Court Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Jersey&#8217;s Supreme Court ruled documents indicating a
bank&#8217;s intention to foreclose on a mortgage must name the lender
before a residential property can be seized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case involves the foreclosure on an East Orange home
owned by Maryse and Emilio Guillaume, who received a notice of
intention to foreclose in May 2008. That notice included the
name of the mortgage servicer, America&#8217;s Servicing Co., while
omitting the name of the lender. Credit Suisse AG made the loan
and assigned it to US Bank NA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state high court in Trenton ruled yesterday that the
notice sent to the Guillaumes failed to comply with New Jersey&#8217;s
Fair Foreclosure Act, which requires the name and address of the
actual lender, as well as contact information for a loan
servicer. Failure to do so creates &#8220;potential for significant
prejudice&#8221; to homeowners, the court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A misunderstanding about a lender&#8217;s identity could prompt
a homeowner to make a critical error at a time when he or she is
struggling to avert foreclosure,&#8221; the court said in the
opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court ruled that while a trial court judge erred on
that point in interpreting the Fair Foreclosure Act, the judge
reached the correct conclusion in ordering a default judgment
against the couple. The Guillaumes failed to demonstrate either
&#8220;excusable neglect&#8221; or a &#8220;meritorious defense&#8221; to their
foreclosure, according to the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision &#8220;restores order&#8221; to New Jersey&#8217;s real estate
market, said Mark Melodia, a lawyer for Minneapolis-based US
Bancorp (USB), the parent of US Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a reaffirmation that our Chancery Court judges
are best positioned to determine in a given case whether a
technical defect in foreclosure paperwork requires the
extraordinary step of dismissing the case -- which, like this
one, may have been pending for years before the defect was
identified -- or whether a less drastic remedy, such as sending
a new notice, is the fairer way to proceed,&#8221; Melodia, of Reed
Smith LLP, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An attorney for the Guillaumes, Rebecca Schore of Legal
Services of New Jersey, said that while she was pleased with the
ruling on the need to name the actual lender in a notice of
intention to foreclose, she was disappointed that the court
didn&#8217;t require dismissal of the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We hope that the New Jersey legislature will take this
opportunity to clarify the statute and require dismissal of a
foreclosure complaint where the plaintiff fails to comply
strictly with its requirements,&#8221; she said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is US Bank National Association v. Guillaume,
11-068176, New Jersey Supreme Court (Trenton). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Speculation Limits Judge Says He&#8217;s &#8216;Skeptical&#8217; of CFTC Rule &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission arguments in
support of the agency&#8217;s limits on speculation are being
questioned by the judge presiding over a challenge to the rule
by two Wall Street groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m kind of skeptical about their position of Congress
mandating position limits,&#8221; U.S. District Judge Robert Wilkins
said during a hearing in Washington yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc.
and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association
urged Wilkins to put the rule on hold while he considers their
legal challenge. They argued financial firms including Barclays
Plc and JPMorgan Chase  Co. are losing millions of dollars
preparing for a regulation that is likely to be overturned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The groups argue that the CFTC never studied whether the
regulation was &#8220;necessary and appropriate&#8221; or quantified the
costs tied to implementing the rule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is not a country where we look at tens of millions
of dollars in direct costs and the entire restructuring of an
industry and say that&#8217;s not irreparable harm,&#8221; Eugene Scalia, a
lawyer for the groups, told the judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The groups, in one of the financial industry&#8217;s highest-
profile efforts to weaken 2010&#8217;s Dodd-Frank law, filed lawsuits
in two federal courts in Washington in December challenging the
rule setting caps on the number of contracts a trader can have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Marcus, a lawyer for the CFTC, said the harm some
of the groups&#8217; members claim they&#8217;ve incurred seeking to comply
are &#8220;miniscule&#8221; when compared to the companies&#8217; annual revenue
and income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilkins said he will take the matter &#8220;under advisement&#8221;
and issue a ruling &#8220;quickly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is International Swaps and Derivatives Association
v. U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 11-02146, U.S.
District Court, District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.S. High Court Permits Suit on Investing Racketeering Profit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court allowed a New York City steel
products retailer to proceed with a federal racketeering lawsuit
claiming that a competitor gained an illegal advantage by
investing criminal proceeds in a business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has fought to restrict
the use of federal racketeering laws in corporate conflicts, had
urged justices to block that sort of claim. Letting the case
proceed &#8220;would enable competitors who do not succeed in the
marketplace to harass their rivals&#8221; via the courtroom, the
Washington-based business organization said in a brief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideal Steel Supply Corp. filed suit under the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act alleging that a rival
company, National Steel Supply Inc., used money from a tax-fraud
scheme to open a competing store that damaged its business. The
justices yesterday declined to hear an appeal by National
seeking to block the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The racketeering law, known as RICO, permits lawsuits
seeking triple damages associated with conspiracies involving a
pattern of criminal activity. Originally targeted at organized
crime, the law&#8217;s penalties have made it a weapon in more garden-
variety business disputes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said
Ideal can proceed to trial with a claim that closely held
National illegally boosted its business and profit for years by
failing to collect sales tax from customers who paid with cash
at a store in Queens. National used the ill-gotten gains to
start a store in the Bronx, where closely held Ideal previously
had a local monopoly on its niche-market products, according to
the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court, without comment, declined yesterday to
consider Nation&#8217;s appeal of that ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case continues a long-running family feud: the Brancato
and Anza families who own Ideal and National are in-laws and
cousins in addition to being business rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp., 11-659, U.S.
Supreme Court, (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Litigation Department &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SEC&#8217;s Ex-Top Lawyer to Repay $556,000 in Madoff Ponzi Funds &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family of David M. Becker, the former top lawyer for
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, agreed to pay
$556,017 to settle claims over inherited money that was linked
to Bernard Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The payment is equal to the entire amount of profits that
Becker and his brothers inherited from a Madoff account held by
their mother, who died in 2004, according to a statement
yesterday by Amanda Remus, a spokeswoman for Irving H. Picard,
the trustee liquidating Madoff&#8217;s firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard, in a November 2010 lawsuit filed in bankruptcy
court in New York, had originally claimed that the Beckers
received $1.5 million in fictitious profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becker, who left the SEC in 2011 to return to private legal
practice, faced criticism last year after Picard&#8217;s lawsuit was
made public, suggesting he may have had a personal financial
interest in policies he worked on at the SEC related to how
Madoff customers should be compensated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Baker III, Becker&#8217;s attorney, said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday that Becker made full disclosure of his
mother&#8217;s account while he was at the SEC and followed the
agency&#8217;s ethics procedures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becker &#8220;was unaware of his mother&#8217;s account until long
after it was liquidated and he always expected that he would
return any fictitious profits that he unknowingly received,&#8221;
Baker said. &#8220;Mr. Becker has done everything possible, both at
the SEC and in his private affairs, to assist the victims of the
Madoff fraud.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) released the first
broadly available test version of the Windows 8 operating
system, giving consumers an early peek at software designed to
rival the touch-enabled features on Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called Consumer Preview is available for download
from Microsoft&#8217;s website. The Redmond, Washington-based company
demonstrated the software, which lets users store applications
in the Internet-based cloud in order to easily switch between
computers and Windows Phones, in a two-hour session at the
Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona, Spain, today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from Windows software, which runs most of the
world&#8217;s personal computers, has missed analysts&#8217; estimates in
four of the past five quarters, in part because some consumers
are defecting from laptops with Windows to tablets. Microsoft
probably won&#8217;t be able to significantly change that trend until
Windows 8 goes on sale, Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein said
in an interview last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julie Larson-Green, a Microsoft vice president, showed off
the software&#8217;s tile design and the ease of switching between
different applications on a tablet computer. The program allows
users to &#8220;pin&#8221; people to the Windows start screen to
communicate and maintain important contacts. Larson-Green also
demonstrated how the software allows live video to run within an
instant-messaging app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Windows 8 is really fast, fluid and responsive,&#8221;
Windows President Steven Sinofsky said today. &#8220;It&#8217;s really an
operating system for a new generation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Windows App Store &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has declined to say when Windows 8 will be
officially released, although analysts expect it later this
year. Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) has said it plans to introduce a
tablet based on the new software some time before the end of
2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users have the option of signing in to a Windows account,
which lets them connect to their information stored in an
Internet-based cloud on multiple personal computers and Windows
Phones. This lets them access e-mail and calendars, take apps
and settings with them when they switch PCs and lets them use
cloud storage, the company said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The release of the test version also marks the opening of
the Windows app store. Applications will be free during the
Consumer Preview period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operating system marks the first time Microsoft will
release a version of Windows for PCs that also runs on chips
with ARM Holdings Plc (ARM)&#8217;s technology. Those are the kind of
processors that dominate the tablet market, giving those
machines better speed and battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;X86 Version &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test version available for download is the x86 version
of Windows that will run the rival chips from Intel Corp. (INTC) and
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) The ARM-based systems will get a
narrower test audience, with Microsoft distributing thousands of
them shortly, Sinofsky said in an interview earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ARM version of Windows will only be sold pre-installed
on a computer or tablet and won&#8217;t run applications written for
older versions of Windows, while the x86 product will run
existing applications and can be sold separately, Sinofsky said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft released an earlier preview of the program,
designed for software developers writing apps for Windows, in
September. Since them the team has made over 100,000 changes to
the product, Sinofsky said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft fell 0.4 percent to $31.74 at the close in New
York. The shares have gained 22 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Michael J. Moore and Christine Harper" date="Feb 29, 2012  3:14 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-29/goldman-mirrors-jpmorgan-mirrors-goldman-on-swap-exposure-to-european-debt.html"><headline>Goldman Mirrors JPMorgan Mirrors Goldman on Swap Exposure to European Debt</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS), two of the largest derivatives dealers, posted
identical gross notional amounts of credit-default swaps bought
and sold on five troubled European nations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan purchased single-name contracts protecting $147.3
billion of debt and sold $142.4 billion related to the so-called
GIIPS nations of Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, the
bank said in its annual filing today. Goldman Sachs disclosed
the exact same figures in a filing yesterday. In both cases, the
numbers were as of Dec. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks, facing regulatory pressure to more thoroughly
explain risks posed by countries at the center of Europe&#8217;s debt
crisis, are beginning to provide specific gross notional figures
for credit derivatives. The disclosures show the extent to which
firms have insured debt from those nations, and their efforts to
balance that exposure by buying protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are a nearly infinite number of possible
coincidences that could occur any day of the year but don&#8217;t,&#8221;
said Chris Kotowski, an analyst at Oppenheimer  Co. in New
York. &#8220;Every now and then, they do.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the largest U.S. credit-derivative dealer, and
Goldman Sachs is No. 3. The notional amounts represented about 7
percent of Goldman Sachs&#8217; total credit derivatives, and 5
percent of JPMorgan&#8217;s total. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs previously reported only its so-called funded
exposure to the debt of those nations, excluding commitments or
contingent payments such as credit-default swaps. JPMorgan had
provided net figures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In Agreement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top risk managers for the two firms sat next to each other
today at a panel discussion organized by a trade group in New
York. David Weisbrod, vice chairman of risk management at
JPMorgan, and Craig Broderick, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s chief risk
officer, repeatedly agreed with each other&#8217;s statements during
the discussion of new challenges in risk management at the
annual convention of the Global Association of Risk
Professionals. Broderick worked for Chase Manhattan Bank, now
part of JPMorgan, before joining Goldman Sachs, according to the
association&#8217;s convention booklet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said &#8220;master netting agreements&#8221; reduced the
notional amount of protection purchased to $18.5 billion and the
amount sold to $13.7 billion. The fair value of the contracts
after collateral and netting were $3.9 billion and $2.7 billion,
respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Citigroup, BofA &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs also said that &#8220;legally enforceable netting
agreements&#8221; would reduce the amount of credit-default swaps
purchased on the five countries to $21.1 billion and the amount
sold to $16.2 billion. Those so-called notional amounts exclude
collateral as well as derivatives from outside those nations
that could mitigate the risk, according to the filing. Both
banks are based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C) said the net notional amount of swaps it
purchased on the GIIPS nations was $16.9 billion, and the net
amount sold was $7.8 billion. It didn&#8217;t provide gross figures.
Bank of America Corp. also didn&#8217;t disclose notional amounts
related to those nations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS), the second-largest credit derivative dealer
among U.S. banks, included net notional amounts of credit-
default swaps within its net inventory category, which also
comprised long and short positions in debt and equity securities
tied to the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Michael J. Moore, Dakin Campbell and Christine Harper" date="Feb 29, 2012 11:11 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-29/jpmorgan-joins-goldman-in-disclosing-threat-of-sec-action-over-mbs-sales.html"><headline>JPMorgan Joins Goldman in Disclosing Threat of SEC Enforcement</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) and Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) are among banks warned by
federal regulators that they may face civil claims tied to sales
of mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said in a filing today that the Securities and
Exchange Commission warned in January it may bring complaints
stemming from two investigations into mortgage securitizations.
Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo also said yesterday they received
so-called Wells notices from the SEC, warning that agency staff
may recommend enforcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a big deal given the level of anticipation that has
been in the markets about whether there would be further
actions,&#8221; said Jacob Frenkel, a former SEC lawyer now with
Shulman Rogers Gandal Pordy  Ecker PA in Potomac, Maryland.
&#8220;These cases were complicated and time-consuming and the
government has said for a long time that its investigations were
continuing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC has issued such notices to multiple banks in probes
focusing on mortgage securities, said people with knowledge of
the matter who asked not to be identified because the
communications weren&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost four years after mounting mortgage defaults prompted
unprecedented government bailouts of the financial system,
regulators are still examining how banks packaged and sold home
loans to investors. The SEC is looking for evidence that firms
failed to disclose underlying credit weaknesses in mortgage
pools and delinquencies, Jason Anthony, special counsel for the
agency&#8217;s structured products unit, said last week. He didn&#8217;t
identify companies under scrutiny. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goldman Sachs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said one inquiry focuses on due diligence and
disclosures in two securitizations by a subsidiary. The other
probe relates to &#8220;settlements of claims against originators&#8221;
involving loans included in securitizations handled by Bear
Stearns Cos., which JPMorgan acquired in 2008, according to the
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs got a Wells notice Feb. 24 relating to
disclosures for a late-2006 offering of $1.3 billion in subprime
residential mortgage-backed securities, the company said in an
annual report. The New York-based firm said it &#8220;will be making
a submission to, and intends to engage in a dialogue with, the
SEC staff seeking to address their concerns.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fair Lending &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs paid $550 million in 2010 to settle SEC
claims that it misled investors on a mortgage-linked investment
in 2007. In that case, the company said it made a &#8220;mistake&#8221; in
omitting disclosures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo, which revealed the SEC&#8217;s warning in an annual
report yesterday, said the government has been examining whether
it properly described facts and risks in offering documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notices show SEC enforcement staff concluded that
violations occurred, Frenkel said. John Nester, a spokesman for
the agency, declined to comment on the investigations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government agencies are also looking at whether San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo may have violated fair-lending laws
or other regulations when making home loans, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC said in January it will help form a state and
federal working group that will share information and coordinate
inquiries involving residential mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We already have issued scores of subpoenas, analyzed more
than approximately 25 million pages of documents, dozens and
dozens of witnesses, and worked with our industry experts to
analyze the terms of these deals and the accuracy of the
disclosures made to investors,&#8221; the agency&#8217;s enforcement
director, Robert Khuzami, said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo was among five mortgage servicers that agreed
this month to a $25 billion settlement of state and federal
probes into shoddy foreclosure practices. The deal allowed
regulators to continue pursuing the industry over claims
regarding the packaging of loans into securities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starbucks Corp. (SBUX), the world&#8217;s largest
coffee-shop operator, will begin selling its Seattle&#8217;s Best
coffee brand at Kmart stores and Chevron Corp. (CVX) gas stations as
the company expands beyond its namesake products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kmart, owned by Hoffman Estates, Illinois-based Sears
Holdings Corp. (SHLD), will begin selling Seattle&#8217;s Best packaged
coffee in the U.S. in March, Chris Bruzzo, the brand&#8217;s chief
marketing officer, said in an interview. All of Kmart&#8217;s
approximately 1,300 stores will have it by the end of this year,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starbucks is putting the brand into other U.S. retailers,
such as Chevron&#8217;s 550 ExtraMile convenience stores and some Yum!
Brands Inc (YUM).&#8217;s Taco Bell locations. Subway and Burger King
Holdings Inc. (BKC) restaurants also sell the coffee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re feeling confident that we can build this into a
billion-dollar brand,&#8221; Bruzzo said. Seattle&#8217;s Best is going to
places where it has &#8220;traditionally been hard to find great
coffee,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starbucks, which doesn&#8217;t publicly release revenue for
Seattle&#8217;s Best, is trying to boost sales with items other than
its traditional coffee. In November, the Seattle-based company
bought juicemaker Evolution Fresh Inc. for $30 million.
Starbucks also is expanding sales of beer and wine in some of
its cafes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seattle&#8217;s Best is sold in about 20,000 grocery and mass
retail stores and is becoming more important to Starbucks&#8217;
grocery business, Bruzzo said. Revenue for the company&#8217;s
consumer packaged-coffee segment rose 22 percent to $1.06
billion in the year ended Oct. 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron won&#8217;t sell Seattle&#8217;s Best in all of its stores,
said Ian Noble, district sales manager at the San Ramon,
California-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We would not be able to execute,&#8221; he said. ExtraMile is
Chevron&#8217;s higher-end gas station brand with stores in
California, Oregon and Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 20-ounce cup of coffee will cost $1.56 at Chevron,
compared with $1.86 at Seattle&#8217;s Best retail stores. The same
size coffee at Starbucks is $1.95. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank by assets, said the Securities and Exchange Commission
warned in January that it may bring civil claims after two
investigations relating to mortgage securitizations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One inquiry focuses on due diligence and disclosures in two
securitizations by a subsidiary, the New York-based bank said
today in a regulatory filing. The other probe relates to
&#8220;settlements of claims against originators&#8221; involving loans
included in securitizations handled by Bear Stearns Cos., which
JPMorgan acquired in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Cornelius Rahn and Diana ben-Aaron" date="Feb 29, 2012 10:09 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-29/microsoft-plans-more-ads-for-windows-phone-to-smoke-rivals.html"><headline>Microsoft Plans More Advertising for Windows Phone to &#8216;Smoke&#8217; Competitors</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s
largest software maker, said it will increase advertising
spending to build market share for Windows Phone as it drives
into new regions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The next year to 18 months is really about seeing a
significant uptake in market share,&#8221; Aaron Woodman, the
director of Windows Phone, said in an interview at the Mobile
World Congress in Barcelona. Microsoft previously focused on
getting publicity and good reviews for the system, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft handset partners led by Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) sold about
2.8 million Windows Phones in the fourth quarter for a
1.9 percent market share in smartphones, according to Gartner
Inc. The software maker needs to peddle tens of millions of
units a quarter to make its mobile software a durable contender
alongside Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPhone and Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Android. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t feel like we&#8217;re really pushing apart from the
competition,&#8221; Woodman said. &#8220;We need to go pick a fight.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s rallying cry will be that Windows Phone helps
users do what they want to do faster than handsets with other
operating systems, he said. Over the next six months, the
Redmond, Washington-based company will expand its &#8220;Smoked by
Windows Phone&#8221; campaign, in which users race handsets to
accomplish tasks through various digital and video media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ll do TV spots, the question is where,&#8221; Woodman said.
&#8220;Microsoft is patient and willing to use deep pockets, but
we&#8217;re also respectful of shareholder value so we want to pick
appropriate countries and spend levels.&#8221; He declined to specify
an advertising budget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;China Entry &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entering markets with lower smartphone penetration, such as
China, could help Microsoft build volume. That requires cheaper
handsets that are starting to come to market. Nokia broke the
200-euro mark with the 189-euro ($254) Lumia 610 this week. ZTE
Corp. (000063) also introduced a cheaper Windows Phone, the ZTE Orbit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re getting demand from handset makers and operators to
expand geographically more quickly than we originally thought,&#8221;
Woodman said. &#8220;In China, people are now able to afford data
cost, they&#8217;re pretty comfortable with that price point of the
Lumia 610, so there&#8217;s still significant volume.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is opening mobile applications stores in China,
Thailand, Venezuela and 20 other nations by the end of the
month, with phones arriving around the same time, Terry Myerson,
who oversees the Windows Phone business, said this week. That
will bring the total number of markets Microsoft serves to 63,
letting it target 60 percent more buyers, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lianzi is situated on the maritime border with Angola and

&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Victoria Slind-Flor" date="Feb 29, 2012  7:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-29/yahoo-microsoft-motorola-mobility-intellectual-property.html"><headline>Yahoo, Microsoft, Motorola Mobility: Intellectual Property</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) asked Facebook Inc. (FB) to
license technologies covered by its intellectual property and
threatened to take legal action if the companies don&#8217;t reach an
agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We must insist that Facebook either enter into a
licensing agreement or we will be compelled to move forward
unilaterally to protect our rights,&#8221; Sunnyvale, California-
based Yahoo said Feb. 27 in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo, the largest U.S. Internet portal, is looking for
ways to revive growth after losing ground to Facebook in the
display-advertising market and trailing Google Inc. in Web
searches. Yahoo said it has made &#8220;substantial&#8221; investments in
innovation and that other companies have already agreed to
license those technologies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo&#8217;s statement was previously reported by the New York
Times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook, the world&#8217;s largest social-networking service,
hasn&#8217;t yet been able to &#8220;fully evaluate&#8221; Yahoo&#8217;s claims, said
Larry Yu, a spokesman for the Menlo Park, California-based
company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Yahoo contacted us at the same time they called the New
York Times,&#8221; Yu said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook, which has grappled with lawsuits over
intellectual property in the past, faces potential threats from
other large companies that have patents on social-networking
technologies. Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), the world&#8217;s largest e-commerce
company, owns certain social-networking patents that predate
Facebook by seven years, according to M-Cam Inc., a patent
advisory service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As we&#8217;ve seen over the past few years in the mobile
device field, patent assertion can ultimately lead to blocking
the sale of a product, or, at the very least, an innovation
tariff that drags down earnings,&#8221; according to a report by M-
Cam. &#8220;That&#8217;s only if Amazon wants to play hardball.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary Osako, a spokeswoman for Seattle-based Amazon,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo didn&#8217;t identify companies that license its technology
or elaborate on which intellectual property is the subject of
the discussions with Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;EU to Examine Apple, Microsoft Complaints Over Motorola Mobility &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complaints by Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) against
Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. (MMI) will be examined &#8220;closely&#8221; by
European Union regulators, the region&#8217;s antitrust chief said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joaquin Almunia, the EU&#8217;s competition commissioner, said
competition policy must ensure essential patents aren&#8217;t &#8220;used
strategically to block competitors,&#8221; according to a speech at
the European Parliament in Brussels yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung Electronics Co. is facing an EU antitrust probe
into its licensing of patents to other mobile-phone
manufacturers. Samsung, Motorola Mobility, Microsoft and Apple
are involved in litigation across Europe as demand for
smartphones and tablets soars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc., which is buying Motorola Mobility for $12.5
billion, has written to groups that establish industry standards
to assure them it will fairly license the Libertyville,
Illinois-based company&#8217;s patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To build a modern smart phone one needs thousands of
standard-essential patents,&#8221; Almunia said. &#8220;Any company that
holds these patents can effectively hold up the entire industry
with the threat of banning the products of competitors from the
market. This sort of hold-up is not acceptable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU antitrust regulators are separately investigating claims
Google discriminated against other services in its search
results and stopped some websites from accepting rival ads.
Microsoft and shopping-comparison site Foundem are among
companies that asked the agency to examine the Mountain View,
California-based search-engine firm&#8217;s practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almunia said he expected investigators to give him a report
on Google before the end of April and would decide after that if
a formal antitrust complaint was needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Al Verney, a spokesman for Google in Brussels, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which is examining
whether Google gives preference to its own services in search
results, is expanding its antitrust probe to include scrutiny of
Google+, according to two people familiar with the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Motorola Mobility Says Apple Ruling Vindicates License Rights &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. (MMI) said a German appeals court
that granted Apple Inc. (AAPL) a temporary ruling blocking the
enforcement of a patent verdict shows that inventors should be
paid for their innovations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Motorola Mobility&#8217;s determination to collect fair
compensation for Apple&#8217;s use of patented technology has been
vindicated by&#8221; the court, Motorola Mobility said in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple won the German appeals court ruling Feb. 27 at the
Higher Regional Court of Karlsruhe, Germany. Motorola Mobility,
which forced Apple to remove some iPad and iPhone models from
its German online store for a short period, can&#8217;t enforce the
verdict during an appeal, the court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ericsson Turns to Mobile Wallet Amid Short-Term Uncertainty &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ericsson AB, the world&#8217;s largest maker of wireless-
networking equipment, is making a new push into services such as
money transfers over handsets, as short-term uncertainties weigh
on the growth of its traditional business, Chief Executive
Officer Hans Vestberg said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ericsson, which makes about 37 percent of its revenue
through services, said Feb. 27 at the Mobile World Congress in
Barcelona that it teamed up with Western Union Co. (WU) to grab a
share of the $800 billion worth of &#8216;m-commerce&#8217; it estimates
will be recorded by 2016. Such transactions allow customers to
use their prepaid phone credit to pay for purchases on handsets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the long term, the fundamentals are definitely
there,&#8221; Vestberg said of the growth drivers in the network-
equipment market. &#8220;In the short term, decisions may depend on
what carriers see in the environment around them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ericsson wants to develop new products and services
internally, Vestberg said. &#8220;Our priority is organic growth,&#8221;
he said. Asked whether he was looking to buy patents from
Eastman Kodak Co. (EKDKQ), the photography pioneer that filed for
bankruptcy protection this year, Vestberg said he wasn&#8217;t looking
to acquire more patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have 30,000 patents,&#8221; the CEO said. &#8220;We have the
most patents in 2G, 3G and 4G in the industry and we&#8217;re very
happy with that portfolio. We&#8217;re not looking to get more.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madonna Did or Didn&#8217;t Change Song Title After &#8216;Girls&#8217; Complaint &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Francis, whose Santa Monica, California-based company
produces the &#8220;Girls Gone Wild&#8221; series of adult films, said pop
singer Madonna backed down from the use of his trademark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madonna and her record label changed a song title and
lyrics to &#8220;Girl Gone Wild&#8221; from &#8220;Girls Gone Wild,&#8221; Francis
said in a Feb. 27 statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Clearly her label was trying to avoid legal action
surrounding the song,&#8221; Francis said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counsel for Francis sent Madonna a cease-and desist letter
Feb. 3, claiming that any use of &#8220;Girls Gone Wild&#8221; infringed,
and accusing the performer of attempting to &#8220;free ride&#8221; on the
&#8220;valuable consumer goodwill and brand recognition&#8221; associated
with the filmmaker&#8217;s mark. The letter claimed that Madonna made
unauthorized use of the mark &#8220;to lure potential consumers to
purchase her latest musical effort.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TMZ.com celebrity-gossip website reported that
Madonna&#8217;s manager, Guy Oseary, said the singer never received
the letter and that the song&#8217;s name change had nothing to do
with the film company&#8217;s mark. He told TMZ that the title of the
song was changed because Madonna uses the singular form --
&#8220;girl&#8221; -- when she sings the lyrics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Game Company Says &#8216;Joustin&#8217; Beaver&#8217; Doesn&#8217;t Infringe Bieber &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RC3 Inc., a Florida-based maker of video games, has asked a
federal court in Jacksonville, Florida, to declare it doesn&#8217;t
infringe trademarks related to teenaged pop idol Justin Bieber. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is related to RC3&#8217;s &#8220;Joustin&#8217; Beaver&#8221; video game
app, that the company said was created &#8220;in an effort to comment
upon&#8221; Bieber&#8217;s life. The game is a parody of the young
performer&#8217;s commercial success, according to court papers,
portraying the teen sensation as a beaver with a haircut like
the singer&#8217;s floating on a log down a river. The beaver signs
&#8220;otter-graphs,&#8221; and is harassed by &#8220;Phot-Hogs,&#8221; in the
course of the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RC3 said that despite the fact that it had numerous
conversations with counsel for Bieber, it received a cease-and
desist letter Feb. 13. The letter, which is included in the case
file, demanded that the &#8220;Joustin&#8217; Beaver&#8221; game be removed from
Apple Inc.&#8217;s iTunes and any other site selling mobile device
applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latter, Aaron D. Rosenberg of Los Angeles-based
Myman Greenspan Fineman Fox Rosenberg  Light LLP warned that
Bieber had &#8220;instructed us to take any and all legal action
necessary&#8221; in order to protect his IP rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said it fears being sued for infringement, and
claims the game is a parody permissible under trademark law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It asked the court to declare its game doesn&#8217;t infringe and
seeks awards of attorney fees a litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is represented by Bradley Sopotnick of
Jacksonville, Florida&#8217;s McGrath Gibson LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is RC3 Inc., v. Justin Bieber, 3:12-cv-00193-RBD-
TEM, U.S. District Court, Middle District of Florida
(Jacksonville). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube Video Subject of Infringement Complaint Over Birdsong
    Rumblefish Inc., a Portland, Oregon-based licensor of music
and sound content, accused the amateur maker of a video posted
on Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s YouTube video-sharing website of infringing the
copyright for a recording of wild birdsong, Australia&#8217;s Herald
Sun newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video maker, known on YouTube as &#8220;eeplox,&#8221; posted a
clip of himself foraging for and eating wild salad greens while
wild birds tweet in the background, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said he was told by YouTube that Rumblefish accused him
of copyright infringement, claiming he was using one of the
company&#8217;s recorded birdsong tracks in the background, the Herald
Sun reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rumblefish backed down, according to the Herald Sun, saying
the infringement claim was made by mistake because YouTube
identified a song in the music company&#8217;s catalog &#8220;improperly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sinovel Seeks $17 Million From AMSC in Arbitration &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sinovel Wind Group Co. (601558)&#8217;s complaint against American
Superconductor Corp. (AMSC) claiming it was sold substandard parts will
be heard by the Beijing Arbitration Committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sinovel, China&#8217;s largest wind-turbine maker, is seeking 105
million yuan ($17 million) plus fees for eight turbine-control
units delivered in 2008 that it claims were substandard, the
Beijing-based company said in a filing with the Shanghai Stock
Exchange yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profits may be reduced as a result of the arbitration case,
the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Superconductor is suing Sinovel in Chinese courts,
seeking more than $1.2 billion in damages for allegedly stealing
intellectual property and violating sales contracts. Before the
suit, Sinovel was the Devens, Massachusetts-based company&#8217;s
largest customer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Co SA (EEEK),
the world&#8217;s second-biggest bottler of Coke beverages, will cut
its production plants in Greece to three from five as the
recession hits revenue in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales have declined over the last three years as Greek
consumers cut spending amid austerity measures, the Athens-based
company said in an e-mailed statement today. The cuts will
affect 30 employees, according to the e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greek economy is in its fifth year of recession and the
government has committed to additional austerity to secure a 130
billion-euro second international bailout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Hellenic is &#8220;consolidating its operational
structure to improve efficiency, reduce costs and continue to
contribute to the Greek economy,&#8221; according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production from the Thessaloniki and Patras plants will be
moved to Schimatari, Volos and Heraklion, according to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola HBC reported a fourth-quarter net loss of 11.8
million euros ($15.9 million) compared with a profit of 22
million euros in the same period a year earlier.  Revenue rose

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s (JPM) pipeline of
clients from China seeking financing overseas has doubled from a
year ago to a record, led by developers seeking funds, said the
head of its China investment banking business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We saw a level of activity that we&#8217;ve never seen in the
past&#8221; by property companies tapping offshore debt markets, Fang
Fang, who is also managing director and Asia vice chairman for
New York-based JPMorgan, said in an interview yesterday. He
declined to provide specific figures. &#8220;We are seeing the return
of the equity investor as well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. lender by assets, is among banks
benefiting from a revival in overseas fundraising by China&#8217;s
largest developers, who aim to ease a cash crunch as home prices
drop and the government maintains curbs on the property market.
Last month, JPMorgan was among banks that arranged a $500
million bond sale by China Overseas Land  Investment Ltd. (688) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank&#8217;s ties to China go back to 1911, when it led
a syndicate in managing a railway company&#8217;s $7.5 million bond
sale. In 1921, Equitable Eastern Banking Corp., one of
JPMorgan&#8217;s predecessor firms, opened a Shanghai branch,
according to the lender&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lagging Behind Rivals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan began offering investment banking services in
China in the middle of last year after tying with First Capital
Securities Co. (FISCPZ) as a joint-venture partner in March 2010. That
puts it behind rivals such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which in
2004 became the first Wall Street firm to firm to win an
underwriting license in China, and Zurich-based UBS AG, which
began operations on the mainland in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;California-blend diesel in San
Francisco strengthened for the second day to the highest level
against futures in almost four months after Chevron Corp. (CVX) flared
gases at the Richmond refinery in Northern California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend, low-sulfur diesel, known as CARB diesel,
in San Francisco (DIEISCAD) rose for a second day, by 3.5 cents to a
premium of 16.5 cents versus heating oil futures traded on the
New York Mercantile Exchange, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That&#8217;s the largest premium for the fuel in San
Francisco since Nov. 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, flared gases at
the 240,000-barrel-a-day Richmond (CTRCCRUD) refinery yesterday, according
to a notice filed with Contra Costa County regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We reported a Level 1 incident yesterday morning,&#8221;
Melissa Ritchie, a Chevron spokeswoman at the refinery, said in
an e-mail today. &#8220;Beyond that we do not comment on day-to-day
operations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Richmond plant, the largest oil refinery in Northern
California, also flared gases Feb. 27 &#8220;due to low feed rates
and unstability of the plant,&#8221; according to a state regulatory
notice. Sean Comey, a Chevron spokesman in San Ramon, declined
to comment on the filing and said the refinery &#8220;continues to
supply products to our customers without interruption.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CARB diesel in Los Angeles (DIEILCAD) gained 1.5 cents to a 15.5-cent
premium. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Distillate Supplies &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distillate stocks in California dropped 7.6 percent to 3.77
million barrels last week, the lowest level in eight weeks, the
state Energy Commission said yesterday. London-based BP Plc (BP/)
started a hydrocracker at the 266,000-barrel-a-day Carson (BPCRCRUD)
refinery in Southern California earlier this week following
unplanned repairs, a person familiar with the work said Feb. 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in Los Angeles (MOGLDB85) fell
for the fourth straight day, slipping 6.75 cents to a premium of
14.75 cents against Nymex gasoline futures, the lowest level in
three weeks. San Francisco (MOGSD85P) Carbob fell 6.75 cents to 11.75 cents
above futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California gasoline supplies rose for the first time in
three weeks, by 441,000 barrels to 7 million in the week ended
Feb. 24, the state Energy Commission said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jet fuel in Los Angeles strengthened for the second day, by
0.5 cent to a premium of 12 cents. Inventories (CALXREFP) of the aviation
fuel fell dropped 7.9 percent to 3.5 million barrels last week,
an 11-week low, state data showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in Portland (MOGHD87P), Oregon,
weakened for the fourth day, by 3 cents to a discount of 9.5
cents a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesoro Corp. (TSO), based in San Antonio, brought the catalytic
cracking and alkylation units at the 125,000-barrel-a-day
Anacortes (TEANCRUD) refinery in Washington state back to service following
repairs, two people familiar with the work said Feb. 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Process units (unspecified) at Tesoro&#8217;s Anacortes
refinery have been restarted and operations are at planned
rates,&#8221; Tina Barbee, a spokeswoman at the company&#8217;s
headquarters in San Antonio, said in an e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the new Walt Disney Co. (DIS) film
&#8220;John Carter,&#8221; a Civil War veteran transported to Mars fights
giant saber-toothed apes and four-armed, sword-wielding aliens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things are only a little less scary here on earth, where
the pricey picture -- researcher Box Office Mojo pegs its cost
at about $250&#160;million, not counting marketing -- is already
battling bad buzz, reports of cost overruns, and criticism of
Disney&#8217;s early marketing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hollywood studios in recent years have made fewer, more
expensive films that can spawn sequels and become long-lived
franchises. When it works, the payoff is big: The Harry Potter
string of eight films has brought in $7.7&#160;billion at the box
office. For every &#8220;Toy Story,&#8221; there&#8217;s a &#8220;The Adventures of
Pluto Nash,&#8221; which made back less than a 10th its estimated
$100&#160;million budget through ticket sales, Bloomberg Businessweek
reports in its March 5 edition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;John Carter&#8221; is also a test of whether Burbank,
California-based Disney can spread the magic of animation
powerhouse Pixar, which it acquired in 2006 for $7.01&#160;billion,
to live-action films. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Stanton, the writer and director of &#8220;John Carter,&#8221;
previously co-wrote and directed Pixar hits &#8220;Finding Nemo&#8221; and
&#8220;WALL-E,&#8221; for which he won Academy Awards. He was a writer on
&#8220;Monsters, Inc.&#8221; and all three &#8220;Toy Story&#8221; movies. While
&#8220;John Carter&#8221; isn&#8217;t just different because it uses real
actors, it&#8217;s more costly than any of Stanton&#8217;s previous films. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) said it
&#8220;fundamentally disagrees&#8221; with an advisory group&#8217;s criticism
of its pay practices and the process for naming Chief Executive
Officer Robert Iger to the added role of chairman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Institutional Shareholder Services, which consults on
governance issues, has recommended voting against members of
Disney&#8217;s governance and nominating committee and criticized the
compensation of Iger, the Burbank, California-based company said
today in regulatory filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company accused ISS of second-guessing its independent
directors and urged shareholders to back the board&#8217;s decisions.
The filings are designed to bolster support for Disney ahead of
the March 13 annual meeting, when all 10 board nominees will be
up for re-election, including four ISS opposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Disney fundamentally disagrees with certain of ISS&#8217;s
recommendations, which are based on both flawed premises and
methodology,&#8221; the company said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The October decision to make Iger chairman when John Pepper
steps down this month represents an &#8220;about-face&#8221; from reforms
adopted in 2004 when then-chairman Michael Eisner relinquished
the title under pressure from shareholders, ISS said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are not second-guessing the board&#8217;s rationale for
choosing to recombine the roles, or its right to do so,&#8221; ISS
said in a Feb. 29 report. &#8220;We are highlighting concerns with
the process underlying the board&#8217;s action, which reversed an
earlier commitment to independent board leadership without
transparency or shareholder input.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CEO Pay &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger&#8217;s pay has climbed to $30 million from $17.3 million
over a six-year period, ISS said in the 28-page document. While
Disney increased the dividend by 50 percent last year, an
investment of $100 in the stock five years ago was worth only
$105 at the end of fiscal 2011, the group said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ISS assertion that Disney &#8220;reversed a commitment to
independent board leadership without conducting outreach to
shareholders beforehand&#8221; is false, the company said, adding no
such pledge existed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company lived up to its commitment by explaining the
decision and appointing an independent lead director, according
to the filing. Iger&#8217;s pay is &#8220;entirely in line&#8221; with that of
its media peers that include CBS Corp. (CBS), News Corp. (NWSA), Time Warner
Inc. (TWX), Viacom Inc. and Comcast Corp. (CMCSA), the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney also said a $100 investment made when Iger took over
in October 2005 had appreciated to $171 as of year-end, while
comparable companies returned no more than $136. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney rose 1 percent to $42.39 at the close of trading in
New York. The stock has gained 13 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Bristol-Myers Squibb
Co.&#8217;s new blood-thinning pill Eliquis has had its review by U.S.
regulators delayed by three months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The delay is from additional data the two companies
submitted, Bristol-Myers said in a statement last night. The new
data is a &#8220;major amendment to the application and will require
additional time for review,&#8221; the drugmaker said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medicine will be sold by the two New York-based
companies to prevent stroke and embolisms in patients with
atrial fibrillation, or an irregular heartbeat. The drugmakers
will split sales from the pill, which Tim Anderson, an analyst
with Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in New York, estimates at $2.5
billion a year by 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A small delay in the approval of Eliquis would not be
terribly material to either Bristol-Myers (BMY) or Pfizer in our view,
and FDA delays with new drugs are certainly not an uncommon
occurrence,&#8221; Anderson wrote yesterday in a note to clients, in
which he predicted the delay. &#8220;However, this could cut into
analyst sales forecasts slightly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration now aims to rule on
the drug by June 28, Bristol-Myers said in the statement, from a
late March deadline. If approved by the FDA, Eliquis will
compete with Xarelto, sold by Bayer AG (BAYN) and Johnson  Johnson,
and Pradaxa, sold by Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH (BING). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There aren&#8217;t plans for the FDA to convene an advisory
committee to rule on the drug, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bristol-Myers rose 1.5 percent to $32.64 at the close of New
York trading. Pfizer climbed 1.7 percent to $21.49. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Elisa Martinuzzi" date="Mar 01, 2012  9:43 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-01/jpmorgan-joins-ubs-to-offer-to-unwind-milan-swap-to-limit-damages-at-trial.html"><headline>JPMorgan, UBS Offer to Unwind Milan Swap, Pay City&#8217;s Profit as Settlement</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Four banks charged with defrauding
Milan with derivatives offered to unwind the swap at a discount
and pay the city its profit from the transaction under a
proposed settlement with the municipality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a draft agreement drawn up by the city
administration, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), UBS AG (UBSN), Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)
and Depfa Bank Plc will reverse the deal for 63 million euros
($84 million). The banks will cut that fee to 23 million euros
and pay Milan its 476 million-euro mark-to-market gain on the
swap, according to the papers seen by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In return, Milan will drop its claims for damages from the
banks a prosecutor accuses of tricking the city into buying the
swaps by hiding the fees they reaped from the trade. The banks
won&#8217;t admit any responsibility as part of the settlement on the
30-year swaps, and will ask a court to return funds seized
during the criminal proceedings, the document shows. The
agreement is pending final approval by both sides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A transaction of this kind eliminates the financial
damages that the banks might have to pay if they were convicted,
and it may lessen the sanctions that could include being barred
from doing business with certain clients,&#8221; said Alessio Lanzi,
a criminal lawyer in Milan, who is not involved in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government is &#8220;satisfied&#8221; with the reduction in
costs, according to the document. Officials for the city
declined to comment, as did spokeswomen for UBS, Deutsche Bank,
JPMorgan and a spokesman for Depfa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hidden Fees &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lenders charged 101 million euros in fees for arranging
the derivatives that adjusted payments on the city&#8217;s 1.7
billion-euro bond offering in 2005 and from subsequent
restructurings, according to city prosecutor Alfredo Robledo.
That the fees weren&#8217;t disclosed makes them fraudulent, he said
as he secured charges against the banks in March 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks said in court that firms don&#8217;t typically disclose
what they&#8217;re charging municipalities to arrange swaps, tailored
trades that lack comparable market prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Every time I sold a derivative to a public
administration, even before getting to the details, the first
question was always, &#8216;How does the bank make money?&#8217;&#8221; Antonia Creanza, a JPMorgan Chase banker, told the court in September
under questioning by her lawyer. &#8220;I would explain that we would
retain a margin. Never has a legal adviser told me, &#8216;Look you
need to detail the gross margin,&#8217;&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the agreement, the city will commit to not describe
the deal as the reimbursement of the alleged &#8220;implicit costs&#8221;
of the original transactions, and the banks will drop a suit at
the High Court in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Reasonable Rate&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firms say raising the cash to fund the payment to Milan
will cost about 53 million euros, according to the document. The
other costs are linked to hedging the swaps. UBS expects to
charge the least, at 8.9 million euros, and Deutsche Bank, at
24.5 million euros, the most. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The costs reflect a funding gap for which the banks
appear to be charging at a reasonable rate,&#8221; said Jacopo Ceccatelli, founder of JC  Associati SIM, a Milan-based
financial advisory firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milan plans to place about 138 million euros of the cash it
will receive from the banks in U.K. deposit accounts with the
four firms on which it will earn interest equal to 3-month
Euribor, the filing shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city will also invest about 275 million euros in
Italian government bonds which it will be free to buy through
other intermediaries, according to a person with knowledge of
the settlement proposal who declined to be identified because
the agreement isn&#8217;t final. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cash and bonds will be pledged as guarantees for swaps
that the municipality still retains with the banks. Milan sold
the banks a credit-default swap on Italy, a transaction on which
the city is losing about 206 million euros, the filing shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The municipality, which claimed that it had relied on the
banks&#8217; advice in arranging the swaps in 2005, says it&#8217;s now
acting independently based on its own assessment of the risks,
according to the term sheet. The city will seek prior approval
from the Treasury. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A U.S. trade agency said it will
review a judge&#8217;s findings that Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. (MMI)
infringed one Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) patent and not six others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. International Trade Commission said today that it
will consider aspects of all seven patents. The agency has the
power to block imports of products that violate U.S. patent
rights. Notice of the decision was posted on the agency&#8217;s
website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility, being bought by Google Inc. (GOOG), was accused
of infringing seven Microsoft patents. Microsoft said it&#8217;s owed
royalties from any company making products running on Google&#8217;s
Android operating system, and filed the ITC complaint to stop
imports of Motorola Mobility&#8217;s Android-based phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge found that the six patents weren&#8217;t infringed, and
that two were invalid. The case targets Motorola Blur devices,
including the Atrix, Backflip, Bravo, Charm, Cliq, Devour,
Droid, Droid 2, Spice and the Xoom tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission said it will consider the judge&#8217;s
infringement analyses of the patents, the validity of the patent
that Administrative Law Judge Theodore Essex had found
infringed, and whether Microsoft had met the requirement that it
be using the inventions as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We look forward to the ITC&#8217;s review of the issues it has
identified,&#8221; Microsoft Deputy General Counsel David Howard said
in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We remain confident that the
Commission will affirm that Motorola has infringed our
intellectual property.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Broader Effort &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility said the questions asked by the
commission may help it win the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Motorola is pleased with today&#8217;s ITC notice identifying
the issues to be reviewed in the ALJ&#8217;s initial determination of
December 20, 2011,&#8221; Christa Smith, a spokeswoman for the
company, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is part of a broader effort to curtail the growth
of Android, licensed for free by Google to further its mobile-
advertising business. The platform has become the most popular
for smartphones, with 51 percent of the global market in the
fourth quarter, compared with 2 percent for Microsoft, according
to researcher Gartner Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s biggest software maker, has said it
reached licensing agreements with makers of more than 70 percent
of the Android-based smartphones sold in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL), whose operating system had 24 percent of the
global smartphone market, also is suing makers of Android
devices, seeking to force Android handset and tablet makers into
removing key features that it contends copy the iPhone and iPad.
Overall, the companies are vying for share of a market that
researcher IDC said increased 55 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Infringed Patent &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent found to be infringed by Essex is among those
covering a Microsoft program called ActiveSync, which is broadly
licensed through the industry, including to Apple and Google.
Motorola Mobility, based in Libertyville, Illinois, has said it
would be able to design around the patent to ensure imports
aren&#8217;t stopped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patents in which no violation was found by the judge
involved methods to eliminate redundant data transmission,
generate meeting requests, create file names, select from
content menus, manage changes to a contact database and
integrate computer functions to a telephone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;XBox Claim &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility has filed its own patent-infringement
claim against Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft at the agency,
seeking to block sales of the XBox video-gaming system. Essex is
scheduled to release his findings in that case on April 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said Feb. 22 it filed a competition complaint
against Google and Motorola Mobility in Europe, claiming the
companies have refused to license their patents on fair and
reasonable terms. Google called the European Commission
complaint &#8220;just another example of their attempts to use the
regulatory process to attack competitors,&#8221; and Motorola
Mobility has said it&#8217;s willing to license the patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s case against Motorola Mobility is In the Matter
of Certain Mobile Devices, Associated Software and Components
Thereof, 337-744, while Motorola Mobility&#8217;s case against
Microsoft is In the matter of Gaming and Entertainment Consoles,
337-752, both U.S. International Trade Commission (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jose de Menezes Berenguer Neto, head
of retail, asset management and private banking at Banco
Santander Brasil SA, will leave to join a unit of JPMorgan Chase
 Co. (JPM), two people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berenguer, 45, will depart at the end of March to join
JPMorgan&#8217;s Gavea Investimentos Ltda., the Rio de Janeiro-based
private-equity and hedge fund founded by former Brazil central
banker Arminio Fraga, according to the people, who asked not to
be identified because the decision hasn&#8217;t been made public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santander, which generates more profit in Brazil than
anywhere else, will announce management changes for the country
at the end of March as it boosts the number of Spaniards on the
team, the people said. Brazil contributed more than 28 percent
of Santander&#8217;s earnings last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berenguer referred questions to a Santander spokesman, who
declined to comment, as did a spokesman at Gavea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berenguer joined Santander in 2008 when the company
acquired Banco ABN Amro SA, where he was a senior vice
president. ABN Amro&#8217;s former Brazil chief executive officer,
Fabio Barbosa, became Santander Brasil&#8217;s CEO at the time and
took on the role of chairman last year. Barbosa resigned in
September to become head of Abril SA, a Sao Paulo-based media
company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berenguer, an executive with experience in investment
banking and corporate finance, took on Santander Brasil&#8217;s retail
business in March 2011 in what was supposed to be a step toward
replacing Barbosa as CEO, according to the people. That plan was
abandoned. Marcial Portela, a former general director at
Santander in Spain with close ties to Chairman Emilio Botin,
succeeded Barbosa as CEO last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignacio Dominguez-Adame moved to Brazil from Spain to take
over for Berenguer as head of global banking and markets in
Brazil in March 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. was sued by a
Principal Financial Group Inc. (PFG) unit, which accused the bank of
making false statements in connection with the sale of $114.9
million in residential mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Principal Life Insurance Co., a unit of the Des Moines,
Iowa-based seller of insurance and retirement products, accused
New York-based JPMorgan Chase of making &#8220;misrepresentations and
omissions&#8221; about the mortgage loans that were pooled together
into the securities, according to documents filed in New York
state Supreme Court yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
biggest recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
and the crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the
market for the securities evaporated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan Chase,
didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a telephone message left at her
office seeking comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Principal Life Insurance Co. v. JPMorgan Chase
 Co. (JPM), 650615/2012, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Georgian government&#8217;s proposal
of visa-free travel for Russians will boost energy investments
and tourism, Economy Minister Vera Kobalia said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Mikheil Saakashvili called for closer economic
ties between the two nations with an eye on increasing
investment from Russia, which totaled $150 million last year,
mainly in energy projects, Kobalia said in an interview today in
Tbilisi, the capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a great idea and not only will it encourage more
Russian investments, but also allow businesses in Russia to
consider Georgia,&#8221; Kobalia said. &#8220;We are open to any
investments, regardless of politics.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Georgia, which fought a five-day war with Russia in 2008,
has signed 42 agreements to develop hydropower projects as part
of a plan to attract $5 billion to reduce the Black Sea
country&#8217;s dependence on fossil fuels. As many as 12 hydropower
projects are already planned this year, First Deputy Energy
Minister Mariam Valishvili said this week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European banking shares were
upgraded by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) analysts, who said they
anticipate a boost in liquidity and profit from the European
Central Bank&#8217;s three-year loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banking industry was raised to &#8220;overweight&#8221; from
&#8220;neutral,&#8221; according to a Goldman note to clients dated March
1. Even after this year&#8217;s gain by shares of the region&#8217;s
lenders, the stocks are still not expensive, analysts including
Matthieu Walterspiler and Sharon Bell wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The LTRO funding has improved liquidity and effectively
removed, over the medium term, the likelihood of a major bank
failure in Europe,&#8221; according to the analysts, referring to the
ECB&#8217;s Long-Term Refinancing Operation. It &#8220;will help sector
pre-provision profits, while banks still trade at a reasonable
multiple of book value.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Frankfurt-based ECB doled out 529.5 billion euros ($701
billion) to some 800 banks, surpassing economists&#8217; median
estimate of 470 billion euros in a Bloomberg News survey. Two
rounds of three-year loans from the ECB, designed to avert a
credit crunch, have eased concern that Europe&#8217;s banks would run
out of cash or curb lending as the region&#8217;s sovereign-debt
crisis drove up borrowing costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg Europe Banks (BEBANKS) and Financial Services Index
rose 0.5 percent to 87.61 at 10:35 a.m. Frankfurt time.
Commerzbank AG (CBK), Germany&#8217;s second-biggest lender, led gains with
a 3.2 percent advance, followed by Barclays Plc (BARC), Monte dei
Paschi di Siena SpA of Italy and BNP Paribas (BNP) SA of France. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays, the U.K.&#8217;s third-largest lender by assets, took
8.2 billion euros of three-year loans from the ECB to provide
&#8220;funding stability&#8221; for its units in Spain and Portugal, it
said today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Komercni Banka AS (KOMB), the Czech unit of
Societe Generale SA, rose for a fourth day as European leaders
agreed to accelerate payments to a bailout fund and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. raised the region&#8217;s banks to &#8220;overweight.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock increased 0.9 percent to 3,727 koruna as of 9:49
a.m. in Prague, extending this week&#8217;s rally to 2.4 percent. The
14-member PX (PX) index, where Komercni has a 17 percent weighting,
rose 0.3 percent today and 2 percent so far this week. &lt;/p&gt;
