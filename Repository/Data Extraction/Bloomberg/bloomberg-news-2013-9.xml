<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) must pay $8.01
million in deferred compensation to an energy trader the firm
fired for not meeting with government investigators in 2009, a
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority arbitration panel ruled. </p>
<p>Amit Gupta was awarded $4.7 million of stock units he was
promised from 2006 to 2008 and a deferred-cash award of $1.84
million from 2008, plus interest, according to the panel''s Aug.
29 ruling. Gupta, who earned more than $64 million in pay during
his time at Morgan Stanley, also sought as much as $14.2 million
in lost earnings from 2010 to 2012, the ruling shows. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley didn''t consider mitigating circumstances
and follow contractual obligations when it chose to fire Gupta
for cause after he refused to meet in 2009 with the Manhattan
District Attorney''s office, which was investigating a trade,
arbitrators wrote without elaborating on the probe. No charges
were ultimately brought against Gupta. </p>
<p>Mr. Gupta received no fair, reasoned, fully-informed.
individualized consideration of his circumstances, arbitrators
wrote in the ruling. The decision to terminate him for cause''
was so flawed that it does not constitute valid action by Morgan
Stanley. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley is among Wall Street firms that have
increased pay deferrals and strengthened clawback provisions to
recoup compensation from employees fired for cause in the wake
of the financial crisis. Morgan Stanley last year expanded the
list of misconduct that might trigger such penalties. </p>
<p>One of the three arbitrators dissented. Gupta''s decision
was on the advice of his lawyers after an assistant district
attorney said he believed Gupta had committed a pretty clear
violation of criminal law, wrote John Martin, the dissenting
arbitrator. Gupta knew at the time that Morgan Stanley
policy required he cooperate with the inquiry, Martin wrote. </p>
<p>Mark Lake, a spokesman for New York-based Morgan Stanley,
declined to comment. Eric Seiler, an attorney for Gupta, said he
was pleased with the ruling and that it speaks for itself.
Reuters reported the decision earlier today. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is spending 5.44 billion euros ($7.2 billion) to buy Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)''s handset unit so it can gain ground on Apple Inc. and Google (GOOG) Inc. in a smartphone market it let get away -- gaining a possible new chief executive officer in the process. </p> <p>Nokia''s devices and services unit, which accounted for half of the company''s 2012 revenue, along with 32,000 employees, will transfer to Microsoft, the companies said. Nokia CEO Stephen Elop, 49, will return to Microsoft after a three-year stint running the Finnish manufacturer. The move stoked speculation he may be a successor to CEO Steve Ballmer, who said last month he''d retire within 12 months. </p> <p>Microsoft is deepening a push into hardware as dwindling computer sales sap demand for the programs that made it the world''s largest software maker. Nokia shares jumped as much as 48 percent in Helsinki as the sale removes a money-losing handset business and lets it focus on higher-margin networking gear. Even combined, the companies have less than 4 percent of the smartphone market, leaving them far behind Apple and Google. </p> <p>The question is whether combining two weak companies will get you a strong new competitor -- it''s doubtful, said Paul Budde, a telecommunications consultant in Sydney. Both Nokia and Microsoft really missed the boat in terms of smartphones, and it is extremely difficult to claw your way back from that. </p> <h2>Market-Share Decline </h2> <p>Nokia, based in Espoo, Finland, racked up losses of more than 5 billion euros over nine quarters as Elop''s comeback efforts failed to eat into the dominance of Apple (AAPL) and Google''s Android platform in the smartphone market. The stock has lost more than 80 percent in the five years through yesterday. </p> <p>The shares rose 34 percent to 3.97 euros in Helsinki, valuing Nokia at 14.9 billion euros. The shares of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft fell 4.6 percent to $31.88 at the close in New York, wiping out more than $12.6 billion in market value. The company''s market capitalization is now about $265.6 billion. </p> <p>As part of the agreement, Microsoft will pay 3.79 billion euros for Nokia''s devices division and 1.65 billion euros for patents, according to a statement from the companies. The all-cash transaction, subject to Nokia investors'' approval, is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2014. JPMorgan Chase  Co. advised Nokia on the transaction, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc. worked with Microsoft. </p> <h2>Big Transformation'' </h2> <p>Nokia said it will book a gain of 3.2 billion euros, with the sale significantly accretive to earnings. It also said it aims to return its debt, which is ranked junk by all three major rating companies, to an investment grade. Chairman Risto Siilasmaa, who will become Nokia''s interim CEO, said the company may return excess capital to shareholders. </p> <p>It''s a big transformation, but that''s what you''ve got to do in the tech business to move forward, Ballmer told Tom Keene on Bloomberg Television''s The Pulse. </p> <p>Microsoft said it is confident of getting the deal approved by early next year. The transaction will shave 12 cents a share off earnings in the current fiscal year, or 8 cents excluding some items, the company said. In 2015, the cost will be 6 cents based on generally accepted accounting principles. Excluding some costs, the deal will add to profit that year. </p> <p>Microsoft also expects to get more profit for every device sold -- more than $40 a unit for smartphones, compared with the less than $10 in gross profit it currently gets for Windows Phone sold by Nokia. That doesn''t include the costs of marketing and development, though. </p> <h2>Cost Savings </h2> <p>Based on generally accepted accounting principles, the transaction will add to earnings in fiscal 2016, Microsoft said. The company expects to have annual cost savings of $600 million 18 months after the deal closes. </p> <p>The Microsoft purchase was the second major deal to be announced during the U.S. Labor Day holiday yesterday. Verizon Communications Inc. agreed to pay $130 billion for Vodafone Group Plc''s stake in their U.S. wireless venture in the biggest transaction in more than a decade. </p> <p>The Microsoft-Nokia deal is the largest for a wireless device maker after Google''s purchase of Motorola''s handset unit in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. For Microsoft, the deal including the payment to license Nokia''s patents is its second-biggest behind the $8.5 billion purchase of Internet telephone company Skype in 2011. </p> <h2>Motorola Comparison </h2> <p>Microsoft agreed to pay about 0.35 times annual revenue, compared with the median of about 1.4 times for 60 wireless equipment-maker deals tracked by Bloomberg. That also compares with the 0.77 times revenue Google paid for Motorola Mobility, the data show. </p> <p>Google paid about 1.3 times annual operating income for the handset maker, while Nokia''s device and services business reported an operating loss last year, according to the data. </p> <p>With the latest sale, the original pioneers in the mobile-phone industry -- Motorola, Nokia and Ericsson AB -- have all ceased to be independent handset manufacturers or given up on the business. BlackBerry Ltd. said last month it''s considering putting itself up for sale. Its shares advanced less than 1 percent to $10.21 in today''s trading. </p> <p>Microsoft, meanwhile, becomes the last major developer of smartphone operating systems to get into manufacturing. Apple makes its own handsets, which use its iOS operating system. Google''s acquisition of Motorola Mobility gave it its own lineup of phones. </p> <h2>Surface Tablet </h2> <p>Microsoft''s other recent significant move into hardware -- the Surface tablet -- has trailed expectations and the company wrote down inventory last quarter. </p> <p>To break even on an operating basis, Microsoft will need Nokia to sell about 50 million smartphones a year, it said in a presentation. Nokia has a run-rate of about 30 million units. In the second quarter, Nokia sold 7.4 million smartphones under the Lumia line. </p> <p>Microsoft acquired the Lumia brand to use with smartphones, while it will license the Nokia brand to use with low-end phones for 10 years, Elop said at a press briefing today. Microsoft will later decide what to call its future smartphones. </p> <p>Microsoft will face a balancing act owning Nokia and keeping its other hardware partners, including HTC Corp. (2498) and Samsung Electronics Co., committed to its Windows Phone. Aiming to reassure other phone makers that Microsoft will still support them, Ballmer said that the company was 100 percent committed to helping its manufacturing partners. </p> <p>Ballmer declined to say whether Elop would become CEO, or had been a candidate to succeed him. </p> <h2>Microsoft Tie-Up </h2> <p>Ballmer called Nokia''s Siilasmaa shortly after the new year to initiate discussions on an acquisition and the two met in February at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, according to Microsoft. Talks heated up in recent months and a deal was lined up before Ballmer announced his retirement last month, the company said. </p> <p>Microsoft and Nokia have had a close relationship through Elop, who had run Microsoft''s Office unit. He left the software maker in September 2010 to take the top job at Nokia. </p> <p>At the time, Elop likened Nokia''s position to a man standing on a burning oil platform on the verge of being engulfed in flames, facing the option of staying aboard or jumping to the ocean to have a chance to survive. </p> <p>In February 2011, Elop struck a deal with Ballmer to switch Nokia''s smartphones from its own Symbian operating system to Windows Phone. In exchange, Microsoft ponied up more than $1 billion to pay for Nokia marketing and developing products on Windows. </p> <h2>Losing Share </h2> <p>Nokia had the largest share of the mobile phone handset market until it was overtaken by Samsung (005930) in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p> <p>Still, Nokia remains a top seller of traditional mobile phones -- models that are more popular in developing markets. In total shipments, the company ranks second to Samsung among device manufacturers. Samsung accounted for 26 percent of shipments last quarter, while Nokia had 14 percent. Apple came in third with 7.2 percent. </p> <p>After the sale to Microsoft, Nokia''s biggest business will be network equipment, which it recently fully took over from Siemens AG (SIE) and renamed Nokia Solutions and Networks. The unit competes with Ericsson, Alcatel-Lucent as well as China''s Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. (763) </p> <p>Ericsson jumped 5 percent to 82.50 kronor in Stockholm. Alcatel-Lucent, which under new CEO Michel Combes is streamlining its business, added 9.2 percent to 2.20 euros in Paris trading. </p> <h2>Mapping Unit </h2> <p>Nokia said it will also keep its mapping and location services unit, called Here, and its technology development and licensing division. </p> <p>Nokia has a highly evolved device design and manufacturing process which will benefit Microsoft greatly, said Al Hilwa, an analyst at research firm IDC. This is simply the fastest path in front of Microsoft to achieve something like Apple''s vision on devices. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Leonid Bershidsky" date="Sep 03, 2013  3:10 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-03/microsoft-s-ill-starred-nordic-adventures.html"><headline>Microsoft''s Ill-Starred Nordic Adventures</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>Almost 14 years ago, Microsoft announced a major joint venture with a global leader in mobile communications, a company headquartered in a small Nordic country. The goal, according to Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer, was to get all 30 million users of Microsoft''s e-mail platform to use the company''s software on their mobile phones. </p><p>The partner company was called Ericsson, and it was a major producer of mobile handsets. My first mobile phone, bought in Russia in 1998, was an Ericsson. It had a 3-inch antenna, and it did not fit in my jeans pocket.</p><p>Ericsson Microsoft Mobile Venture AB fell apart in 2001. Microsoft never even paid for its 30 percent stake. Having tried working with Microsoft, Ericsson elected instead to team up with Sony to make mobile phones that looked more like consumer products than like telecommunications devices.</p><p>In 2011, that partnership, too, came to an end, with Sony buying Ericsson out for $1.5 billion. The partnership had garnered only a 5 percent share of the global smartphone market, in part because its phones ran Symbian and Windows Mobile, both dead-end systems that lost out to Apple''s iOS and Google''s Android. </p><p>Just before Ericsson sold its share in the business, Sony Ericsson moved to Android. In the 2013 financial year, Sony Mobile -- the renamed former joint venture -- was still losing money but hoping, after some serous cost-cutting, that its Xperia range would carry it into the black.</p><p>Ericsson, for its part, has never regretted moving away from handsets to concentrate on mobile network equipment. It boasts that 40 percent of the world''s mobile traffic runs through networks that it supplied. In 2012, it made a profit of almost $900 million. The consumer business is forgotten like a bad dream.</p><p>By selling its mobile phone business to Microsoft, another Nordic company, Nokia, is following in Ericsson''s footsteps. There is little doubt that the Finns can repeat their Swedish neighbors'' success. Nokia recently bought Germany''s Siemens out of their joint venture, Nokia Siemens Networks, another global leader in network equipment, focusing on mobile broadband. The business lost money last year, but only because of large restructuring charges. In the second quarter of 2013, it showed a profit of about $10 million. </p><p>In terms of importance to Nokia, the infrastructure business, with 2012 sales of $18.2 billion, comes a close second to handsets, which generated $20.7 billion. The phone division, however, lost almost $1.5 billion last year. Along with the growing but risky smartphone business, Microsoft has bought the Finnish company''s rapidly deteriorating line of "feature phones" -- cheap outdated devices with actual buttons. Last year, the unit sales of these Nokia phones decreased 20 percent compared to 2011, and the decline continues.</p><p>Microsoft''s role is similar to that of Sony''s in the Ericsson deal, except it is paying almost five times as much for a smaller, 3.3 percent share of the smartphone market. Nokia CEO Stephen Elop, who once worked for Microsoft and will return to the Redmond company to run the new mobile phone division, has done a great job for the Finnish company''s shareholders. </p><p>Unlike Sony, Microsoft is not a consumer-products company. It has been most successful selling its products to businesses, from computer manufacturers to corporate clients buying licenses for Microsoft Office software. Instead of betting on the most successful operating system, Android, it is intent on pushing its own Windows Phone, ignored by many application developers because of its tiny market share. Ballmer has locked his successor into a money-losing business with a headcount of more than 32,000 people, operating in a highly competitive market where Microsoft is the underdog. </p><p>As for Nokia, it can breathe a sigh of relief. Gone are the (recent) days when its sales equaled 20 percent of Finland''s gross domestic product. Also gone are the losses, offloaded on Microsoft with its $70 billion in cash. Let he who can afford it play the game.</p><p>(Leonid Bershidsky, an editor and novelist, is a Bloomberg View contributor. Follow him on Twitter.)</p>

<p>The surging popularity of

previously projected a 5.8 percent expansion in 2013. </p>
<p>While the smartphone business remains a two-horse race
between Google Inc. (GOOG)''s Android and Apple Inc.''s iOS, the Windows

its holiday faceoff against Sony (6758) Corp. </p>
<p>Consumer demand spurred Microsoft to speed production after
retailers sold out of pre-order allotments, said Yusuf Mehdi,
chief marketing officer for the Redmond, Washington-based
software maker''s interactive entertainment division. Sales this
year will top the debut of the current Xbox 360, he said,
declining to discuss specifics. </p>
<p>We''re building more consoles for day one and for the
holidays than we''ve ever done, Mehdi said in a telephone
interview. It is on track to be the biggest launch by a wide
margin, much bigger than what we did for Xbox 360. </p>
<p>Microsoft and Sony are betting that faster machines
allowing for features such as motion capture and immersive
graphics will entice consumers whose tastes are shifting toward
mobile games played on tablets and smartphones. Microsoft, which
is buying Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)''s handset unit, is stregthening a push into
hardware as demand weakens for programs such as Windows that
made it the world''s largest software maker. </p>
<p>Microsoft also has increased the speed of the Xbox One''s
central processing unit to 1.75 GHz, 10 percent more than
previously targeted, Mehdi said. </p>
<p>You are now able to have even better fidelity of the
games, Mehdi said. The system itself will work much
faster. </p>
<h2>Console Prices </h2>
<p>Retailers began taking orders for the $499 Xbox One and
Sony''s coming PlayStation 4 in June. Last month, Grapevine,
Texas-based GameStop Corp. (GME) raised its profit forecast, citing
strength in console orders. </p>
<p>Microsoft, the top U.S. seller of consoles for more than
two years, will debut the Xbox One a week later than the $399
PS4, which hits American stores on Nov. 15. Nintendo Co. (7974) last
week cut the price of the Wii U by $50 to $299. The console,
introduced last year, has missed company sales targets. </p>
<p>Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, is the
traditional start to the shopping season in the U.S., with
retailers offering discounts to draw customers. </p>
<p>Microsoft will release the Xbox One in 13 countries all on
the same day, giving it a week''s head start in Europe, where the
PS4 starts selling on Nov. 29. Sony will reach stores in 32
markets this year. </p>
<p>Microsoft, which initially targeted 21 countries for its
debut, last month cut the number to 13 to ensure larger markets
have sufficient supplies. </p>
<h2>NFL Highlights </h2>
<p>Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities in Los
Angeles, expects Sony to sell 3 million consoles this year and
12 million in 2014, compared with 2.5 million and 10 million,
respectively, for Microsoft. </p>
<p>Microsoft fell 4.6 percent to $31.88 yesterday in New York,
after announcing that it''s spending 5.44 billion euros ($7.2
billion) to buy Nokia''s devices and services unit. The shares
have climbed 19 percent this year. </p>
<p>Xbox One is an attempt to merge television watching with
video game playing, Mehdi said. Microsoft has teamed with
partners including the National Football League to offer
features such as viewing highlights and game scores. </p>
<p>Microsoft has no plans to offer pay-TV channels in
competition with established providers, nor to spin off the
video-game unit, Mehdi said. Xbox One is part of a companywide
strategy to offer multiple devices to consumers, he said. </p>
<p>That strategy was underscored by the acquisition Nokia''s
handset business. The unit accounted for more than half of the
revenue for the Espoo, Finland-based company, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>We know we live in a multi-device world, Mehdi said.
The people between 18 and 30 -- 80 percent of them are looking
at a phone or tablet while watching TV. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer isn''t letting his departure plans stand in the way of a complete overhaul of the software-centric strategy he spent decades putting in place. </p> <p>Even after saying last month he will retire from Microsoft within the next year, Ballmer is accelerating the company''s move into hardware with a $7.2 billion deal to buy Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)''s handset unit yesterday. That''s an area the Redmond, Washington-based company waded into in the past 18 months, including last year''s introduction of the Surface tablet. </p> <p>Now the company, which built a dominant position in personal-computing operating systems by focusing on software and relying on multiple partners to offer hardware, is diving into its own smartphone line, a low-end handset business and manufacturing operations. With rivals like Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG) leading in mobile, Microsoft executives said the company had few options except to break from its software past. </p> <p>We were in software exclusively and that was a logical thing to do for a long period of time, but the reality today is that''s no longer possible, Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said in an interview. </p> <p>Ballmer had no choice, said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Gartner Inc. Even combined with Nokia, Microsoft has less than a 4 percent share in smartphones and is running out of time to carve out a piece of a market ruled by Google''s Android and Apple''s iOS. </p> <h2>Urgent Change </h2> <p>There must be a sense of urgency that Microsoft feels about how much longer it will take them to make it in mobile and they need to make it in mobile, Milanesi said. There is a sense that they have to move faster than they have been and the only way they can do that is by integrating the hardware and software. </p> <p>Within Microsoft''s headquarters, Ballmer realized last year that the company needed to dump its traditional playbook and make its own phones, said a person familiar with the matter. </p> <p>At the time, Microsoft''s Windows Phones were still at a percentage in the low single digits. It became clear that the company couldn''t gain on competitors or turn phones into a significant moneymaker if Microsoft only made the operating system, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the talks were private. </p> <h2>Six Weeks </h2> <p>Soon Ballmer was on the phone with Nokia Chairman Risto Siilasmaa, resulting in a meeting in February at the Mobile World Congress show, said the person. Various forms of a deal were rejected by both boards and talks seemed dead in June before being revived about six weeks ago, the person said. </p> <p>Peter Wootton, a spokesman for Microsoft, declined to comment on specifics of the talks. </p> <p>With the deal, Microsoft becomes the last major developer of smartphone operating systems to get into phone hardware. Apple makes its own handsets that use its iOS operating system. Google acquired Motorola Mobility last year for about $12.4 billion, giving the company its own lineup of phones. </p> <p>Phones are the most personal of the personal devices people use today and success in phones is important for success in tablets and PCs, Brad Smith, Microsoft''s general counsel, said in an interview. We need to move faster. </p> <p>Ballmer helped Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates formulate much of the strategy that led the company to dominate PC operating systems in the 1990s. As Microsoft''s first business manager, Ballmer negotiated some of the company''s initial deals to put its software on partners'' computers. </p> <h2>Strategy Shift </h2> <p>The formula: focus on software that supports a multitude of devices, give customers choice, hone in on the part of the market that has very high margins and leave the low-margin hardware to others. </p> <p>Microsoft has developed Xbox game consoles since 2001 and took that on because partners weren''t interested. Elsewhere it hewed to the strategy -- it avoided making its own music player, for example, until it was too late to catch Apple''s iPod. </p> <p>Microsoft has increasingly deviated from the formula in recent months. In October 2012, it started selling the Surface tablet. That same month, Ballmer wrote a shareholder letter announcing a new strategy focused on devices and services. In July, he instituted the biggest reorganization in more than a decade to align divisions around his vision. </p> <p>It''s a big transformation, but that''s kind of what you need to do in the technology world to move forward, Ballmer told Tom Keene on Bloomberg Television''s The Pulse. </p> <h2>Trickier Partnerships </h2> <p>Microsoft isn''t completely changing its stripes, and it will still license its Windows Phone software to other handset makers. Yet that will be trickier because Microsoft now has to reassure hardware partners that it isn''t putting Nokia devices ahead of their products. </p> <p>Terry Myerson, head of Microsoft''s operating systems, this week authored a blog post claiming the deal would benefit all Windows Phone partners. He ended with a lyric from the rock band The Killers: I don''t shine if you don''t shine. </p> <p>The move to devices and services means a change for Microsoft''s margins. Internet-based services and hardware are costlier to deliver than software, and margins will decline, Hood said. Microsoft will still be able to increase revenue and profit by selling more, even at a lower margin, she said. </p> <h2>Shareholder Reaction </h2> <p>For phones specifically, Microsoft''s traditional strategy of working with equipment manufacturers wasn''t very profitable, Hood said. The phone unit had to fork over more than $1 billion to Nokia as part of a 2011 deal that got the Finnish phone maker to use the software. Hood said the Windows Phone business will end up with higher operating income once Nokia is integrated than it had without the hardware business. </p> <p>Neither the prospective margins nor Microsoft''s further entrenchment in consumer hardware thrilled shareholders, some of whom favor a focus on business software. The company''s shares fell 4.6 percent yesterday to close at $31.88. </p> <p>This is not good for investors that were hoping the company would narrow their focus to the enterprise, said Pat Becker Jr., a fund manager at Portland, Oregon-based Becker Capital Management Inc., which oversees $2.6 billion including Microsoft shares. Why not let the next CEO make this call? </p> <p>The deal is also serving to jolt investors who read Ballmer''s retirement as a sign Microsoft would reverse course on its devices strategy. </p> <p>Anyone who thought that would be put on hold while a new CEO was sought has to accept that now, said Tony Ursillo, an analyst at Loomis Sayles  Co. in Boston. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Tara Lachapelle and Brooke Sutherland" date="Sep 05, 2013  9:52 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-05/microsoft-out-18-billion-on-ballmer-nokia-deal-real-m-a.html"><headline>Microsoft Out $18 Billion on Ballmer Nokia Deal: Real M&amp;amp;A</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)''s $7.2 billion takeover of Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)''s handset business cost shareholders more than twice that as it dashed hopes for a fresh start under Steve Ballmer''s successor. </p> <p>The world''s largest software company lost $18 billion in market value since the purchase of Nokia''s mobile-phone assets was disclosed, erasing all of the gains that followed the announcement last month that Ballmer is retiring, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The agreement cements the departing chief executive officer''s shift toward the more volatile consumer-device business and leaves little room for his successor to take a different tack, Atlantic Equities LLP said. </p> <p>Microsoft is chasing growth in a market already dominated by Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG) with devices that generate lower returns than the company''s business-software division. Nokia CEO Stephen Elop is returning to Microsoft as part of the asset sale, making him Ballmer''s most likely successor and signaling that the company is in smartphones for the long haul, Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. said, even as some shareholders say that strategy is misplaced. </p> <p>I can''t say I''m too thrilled about the deal, Tim Schwartz, a money manager at Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Schwartz Investment Counsel Inc., which oversees $1.3 billion and owns Microsoft, said in a phone interview. The perception is that this is going to be a continuation of the old management and old-school Microsoft mentality. </p>

<p>Morgans Hotel Group Co. (MHGC) shareholder
Kerrisdale Capital Management LLC said it plans to nominate a
new slate of directors for the company, less than three months
after a board ouster and two days after the resignation of Chief
Executive Officer Michael Gross was announced. </p>
<p>Kerrisdale Capital, which owns about 4 percent of New York-based Morgans, said a new board is needed to sell the boutique-hotel operator, according to a letter to stakeholders, filed
today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>
<p>The current directors of Morgans Hotel do not adequately
represent the interests of the majority of shareholders, New
York-based Kerrisdale said in the letter. </p>
<p>The investment-management firm said it intends to nominate
a separate set of directors in 2014. The proposal follows a
demand by billionaire Ron Burkle''s Yucaipa Cos., also a Morgans
investor, that the board put the hotelier on the market. Burkle
called for a sale in a letter to Chairman Jason Kalisman that
was filed with the SEC two days ago, after Gross''s resignation
was announced. Kalisman is serving as interim CEO of Morgans. </p>
<p>OTK Associates LLC, founded by Kalisman and the owner of
about 14 percent of Morgans shares, led an ouster of the board
in June. Morgans, which operates properties including the
Mondrian in Los Angeles and the Delano in Miami''s South Beach,
has incurred losses each quarter since 2007, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Value Leakage'' </h2>
<p>Maintaining Morgans as a standalone entity is highly
undesirable because we doubt that any management team can add
sufficient operational value relative to the value leakage
incurred by delaying a sale, Kerrisdale said in its letter. </p>
<p>Burkle said earlier this week Yucaipa has more than $200
million of Morgans debt and warrants for about 30 percent of the
company''s stock. OTK in April sued Morgans board members over a
recapitalization deal with Yucaipa. OTK called a proposed swap
for the Delano South Beach and a $100 million rights offer
insider dealings that would benefit Yucaipa while Burkle was
on the board. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) sold its
largest structured notes outside the U.S. in six years, raising
115 million euros ($151.5 million) from securities tied to

<p>The 15-year notes will initially pay coupons based on the
rate for 10-year euro constant-maturity swaps, benchmarks that
measure the cost of exchanging floating rate and fixed interest
payments through the swaps market, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The sale was the New York-based bank''s largest
outside its home market since it raised 230 million euros in
August 2007, the data show. </p>
<p>Sophie Bullock, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in London,
declined to comment on the notes. </p>
<p>Investors in the securities will receive an additional
payment from the fourth year onwards based on the difference
between 10-and two-year swap rates, Bloomberg data show. The
1.61 percentage-point gap between the two rates is the widest
since January 2011, the data show. </p>
<p>A constant maturity swap is a variation of an interest rate
swap where the floating interest portion is reset periodically. </p>
<p>Goldman raised $552.8 million from selling 31 structured
notes outside the U.S. this year, up from $503.4 million in the
same period last year, according to Bloomberg data. </p>

<p>Google Inc. (GOOG)''s Motorola Mobility
didn''t act in good faith when it demanded patent royalties from
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) for use of video-compression and Wi-Fi
technology, a federal jury said yesterday. </p>
<p>The jury in Seattle acted in its first day of
deliberations. Microsoft was awarded about $14.5 million in
damages, the Seattle Times newspaper reported in a blog post. </p>
<p>This is a landmark win for all who want products that are
affordable and work well together, David Howard, Microsoft
deputy general counsel, said in an e-mailed statement. The
jury''s verdict is the latest in a growing list of decisions by
regulators and courts telling Google to stop abusing patents. </p>
<p>We''re disappointed in this outcome, but look forward to
an appeal of the new legal issues raised in this case, William
Moss, a Motorola Mobility spokesman, said in an e-mailed
statement. </p>
<p>The verdict could help the two companies resolve a dispute
over patent royalties for both fundamental technologies in
electronic devices and features that make them easier to use.
More broadly, the case is one front in a global debate on how to
handle patents that relate to technology included in industry
standards used by all manufacturers. </p>
<p>Microsoft claimed that Motorola Mobility acted unreasonably
by demanding royalties of 2.25 percent of the price of an Xbox
video-gaming system or a computer that runs on the Windows
operating system, and then threatening to get a court order
halting sales of the products if the money wasn''t paid. </p>
<h2>Common Tactic </h2>
<p>Motorola Mobility said the October 2010 letters sent to
Microsoft were a common opening offer that it used in
negotiating patent licensing with other companies for years.
Rather than sitting down to negotiate a licensing agreement as
other companies do, Microsoft went to the courts, Motorola
Mobility said. </p>
<p>Microsoft, which reported $73.7 billion in 2012 revenue,
has said the royalty demand would equal more than $4 billion a
year, a figure Motorola Mobility disputed. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge James Robart, who presided over the
trial, determined in April that the appropriate royalty rate was
about a half-cent per unit for video-decoding technology and 3
1/2 cents for wireless technology. Microsoft said that would
equal about $1.8 million a year. </p>
<p>The issue for the jury was whether Motorola Mobility''s
actions were in keeping with the standards of good faith and
fair dealing. Robart, in pre-trial rulings, said Motorola
Mobility''s offers have to be made in good faith, though the
initial offer doesn''t have to be on fair terms as long as the
result is fair. </p>
<h2>Royalty Demand </h2>
<p>Microsoft struck first in 2010, demanding royalties from
companies using Google''s Android operating system and filing a
complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission. Motorola
Mobility responded within weeks by sending a letter saying it
was owed royalties on the Xbox and Windows. The company then
filed its own infringement lawsuits. </p>
<p>Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, won a ruling that
limits imports of Motorola Mobility phones that have a feature
to synchronize calendars with computers. It sued U.S. Customs
and Border Protection for letting the phones continue to enter
the U.S., and both companies are appealing aspects of the case
to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in
Washington, D.C. </p>
<h2>$293.9 Billion Market </h2>
<p>The patent fights are part of a global war for an increased
share of the $293.9 billion smartphone market. They''ve become a
testing ground to determine how to treat patents that cover
basic technology used by companies so that, for instance,
chargers can plug into any device or Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s iPhone can
send and receive images from Samsung Electronics Co.''s Galaxy S4
handset. </p>
<p>Companies that participate in groups to establish
industrywide standards pledge to license any relevant patents on
fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. In return,
they have the advantage of ensuring their technology is widely
used, giving them a leg up on implementing the standard and
establishing a broad base of potential licensees. </p>
<p>A patent gives its owner the power to block others from
using the invention. Microsoft and Apple have both pledged not
to exercise that power when it comes to patents on industry
standards, though they have used other patents in their legal
fights with competitors. </p>
<p>Motorola Mobility and Samsung, two companies with long
histories with mobile phones, have lodged patent-infringement
suits using their patents on fundamental phone technology, such
as how data is transmitted. </p>
<h2>Obama Veto </h2>
<p>President Barack Obama''s administration said limits should
be placed on such patents, and on Aug. 3 vetoed an import ban on
some of Apple''s older phones that Samsung had won. </p>
<p>Samsung, which is under investigation by European
regulators over its use of standard-essential patents, had
agreed not to seek a sales ban on that continent against Apple
for use of any such technology. Google, of Mountain View,
California, reached an agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission that limits its activities regarding those patents. </p>
<p>Robart last year precluded Motorola Mobility from halting
sales of any Microsoft products based on an infringement finding
in Germany. Part of Microsoft''s request for damages was based on
the cost of relocating a logistics center warehouse to the
Netherlands from Germany. </p>
<h2>Sept. 11 Arguments </h2>
<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which
specializes in patent law, is scheduled to hear arguments Sept.
11 on whether there should be different rules for standard
essential patents, and when companies can obtain court orders to
block the use of patented technology. </p>
<p>U.S. Circuit Judge Richard Posner, who normally presides on
the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, threw out cases
Apple and Motorola Mobility had filed against each other. Posner
ruled in June 2012 that Motorola Mobility wasn''t entitled to any
ban on the use of standard-essential patents, while Apple wasn''t
entitled to halt sales of complicated electronics based on an
infringement claim over device features. </p>
<p>The case is Microsoft Corp. v. Motorola Mobility Inc.,
10cv1823, U.S. District Court for the Western District of
Washington (Seattle). </p>

<p>Now that CBS Corp. has prevailed in its monthlong dispute with Time Warner Cable Inc., it''s Bob Iger''s turn to see how much his Walt Disney Co. can squeeze from a pay-TV carrier. </p> <p>Disney, owner of the most-expensive pay-TV channel in ESPN, faces a Sept. 30 deadline to reach a new agreement with Dish Network Corp. (DISH), the second-largest U.S. satellite-TV provider. The negotiations cover how much Dish pays for content and whether it can put programs on mobile phones -- the same sticking points that led to the one-month blackout of CBS on Time Warner Cable systems that was resolved this week. </p> <p>The outcome of those talks bodes well for Iger, Disney''s chairman and chief executive officer, and other content owners. CBS CEO Leslie Moonves won significant price increases while holding on to digital rights. Disney especially is buoyed by ownership of sports network ESPN -- a must-have for pay-TV providers like Dish, which are struggling to keep expenses in check while online players such as Netflix Inc. siphon viewers. </p> <p>Even grandmas watch a lot of sports, so it will be difficult for Dish, Matthew Harrigan, an analyst at Wunderlich Securities in Denver, said in an interview. ESPN and Disney are in a great bargaining position. </p>

<p>Mark Schwartz, chairman of Goldman
Sachs Group Inc.''s Asia-Pacific operations, bought a rare free-standing mansion on Manhattan''s Upper West Side for $14 million. </p>
<p>The deal for the 12,000-square-foot (1,115-square-meter)
home on Riverside Drive closed Aug. 8, according to records made
public yesterday by New York City''s Department of Finance. </p>
<p>The four-story house at the corner of 107th Street is the
last fully detached single-family mansion in Manhattan,
according to the property listing by Tod Mercy of the Corcoran
Group brokerage. It was built in 1909 by William Tuthill, the
designer of Carnegie Hall, and was commissioned by Morris
Schinasi, a Turkish tobacco baron. </p>
<p>Schwartz, 59, agreed to pay 3.7 percent more than the last
asking price of $13.5 million, according to property-listings
website StreetEasy.com. </p>
<p>The 12-bedroom, 11-bathroom house, surrounded by private
gardens and overlooking the Hudson River, is an exquisite
French Renaissance jewel box executed in pristine white marble,
boasting deep-green roof tiles and bronze grills on the
balconies and at the main entrance, according to the Corcoran
listing. </p>
<p>Mercy, the broker, didn''t return a call seeking comment.
Schwartz, who is based in Beijing, didn''t immediately respond to
an e-mail after normal business hours. </p>
<h2>Goldman Return </h2>
<p>Schwartz left New York-based Goldman Sachs in 2001,
returning in June 2012. In the interim, he served as chief
executive officer of Soros Fund Management and later chairman of
MissionPoint Capital Partners, according to his biography on the
bank''s website. </p>
<p>Schwartz first joined Goldman Sachs''s investment-banking
unit in 1979 and became chairman of the Asia business and a
member of the company''s management committee in 1999, the same
year that Goldman Sachs went public. </p>
<p>The seller of the mansion was the estates of Hans and
Beverly Smit. Hans Smit was an emeritus professor at Columbia
Law School who died in January 2012 at the age of 84, according
to the university''s website. His wife, Beverly Smit, a teacher
at the Spence School, died five weeks later, according to a
notice published in the New York Times. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is in talks
to sell a majority stake in its European insurance business to
Singapore''s GIC Pte and Blackstone (BX) Group LP, according to a
person with knowledge of the transaction. </p>
<p>Both GIC, Singapore''s sovereign wealth fund, and
Blackstone, the world''s biggest private-equity firm, may each
buy a stake of about 30 percent in Rothesay Life Ltd., a London-based insurer run by Goldman Sachs partner Addy Loudiadis, said
the person, who asked not to be identified because the
negotiations are private. Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance
Co. may also buy 6 percent, the person said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs said last month that it expects to sell a
majority stake in Rothesay, which has about $9.66 billion in
assets, in the next 12 months as banks face more stringent
capital rules. Goldman Sachs sold about 80 percent of Global
Atlantic Financial Group, a reinsurance business in Bermuda, to
institutions and high-net worth clients this year. </p>
<p>The Financial Times reported earlier today that Goldman
Sachs was set to sell almost two-thirds of the pensions insurer
to GIC, Blackstone and Mass. Mutual. Spokesmen for Goldman
Sachs, Rothesay, GIC and Blackstone declined to comment. A
spokesman for Mass. Mutual, based in Springfield, Massachusetts,
couldn''t be reached outside of normal business hours. </p>
<p>Mass. Mutual invested 100 million pounds ($156 million) in
subordinated debt in Rothesay this year. The transaction is some
way off from being completed, with an announcement unlikely
before the end of September, the person said. </p>
<p>Rothesay insures about 12 billion pounds of insurance
contracts for companies including IAG SA''s British Airways and
General Motors Co. (GM)''s U.K. division. Firms such as Rothesay
promise to pay pensions if retirees live beyond a certain age
and then use derivatives to try to hedge the risk. The insurer
typically receives a portion of the pension plan''s assets. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), faced with rising health care costs for retirees, says it
will move them to a health exchange where they may have cheaper
plan options. </p>
<p>The move affects about 110,000 Medicare-eligible retirees,
Doug Shelton, an IBM spokesman, said by telephone. The company
has chosen the Extend Health exchange by Towers Watson, the
country''s largest private Medicare exchange, to provide more
options for prescription drug, dental and vision care, the
Armonk, New York-based company said in a statement e-mailed
today. </p>
<p>IBM''s move is the latest in a string of large changes that
organizations have made to counter rising health costs. In
August, United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) decided to drop health
benefits for 15,000 of its workers'' spouses, while Michigan
Governor Rick Snyder tried to reduce costs by moving municipal
retirees to exchanges. </p>
<p>This transition provides more choice and flexibility at
equal or better costs to our retirees, IBM said in the
statement. While some retirees may be skeptical today, studies
show that the majority of people who are presented the concept
of an exchange are skeptical at first, but once they understand
the options available to them through these exchanges, they have
a more positive outlook. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX) said it won''t seek
money damages against two Ecuadorians it sued in a New York
racketeering case claiming the pair committed fraud to win a $19
billion verdict in a pollution case in their country. </p>
<p>The oil company also asked that the trial, set to begin
next month in federal court in Manhattan, be held in two parts,
one before a jury and a second before a judge. </p>
<p>Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, was ordered
to pay as much as $19 billion in compensatory and punitive
damages for Texaco Inc.''s alleged dumping of toxic drilling
wastes in the Ecuadorean jungle from 1964 to about 1992. The
ruling came in an 18-year-old case decided by a judge in Lago
Agrio, a provincial capital near the Colombian border. </p>
<p>The company sued in federal court in New York in 2011
accusing Ecuadorians who were named plaintiffs in the case and
their lead legal adviser, Steven Donziger, of improperly
influencing a court expert in the case in Lago Agrio and
committing fraud to win the judgment. U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in New York, who is presiding over the case, scheduled an
Oct. 15 trial. </p>
<p>The San Ramon, California-based oil company said it won''t
seek money damages against the two Ecuadorians, and that a jury
should determine liability claims against Donziger and his law
firm. </p>
<h2>Extensive Evidence'' </h2>
<p>Chevron has uncovered extensive evidence that the 2011
Ecuadorian judgment was fraudulently obtained by the Lago Agrio
plaintiffs, Morgan Crinklaw, a company representative, said in
an e-mail. However, their international campaign to
enforcement that judgment has not gained much traction to date.
The equitable relief Chevron continues to seek against the
Lago Agrio plaintiffs will enable us to protect our assets, and
those of our subsidiaries, from being seized by the Lago Agrio
plaintiffs or in their name. </p>
<p>Kaplan today rejected a request by Donziger and two of the
individual plaintiffs in the Ecuadorean suit to delay the trial
pending a decision by the Manhattan-based U.S. Court of Appeals. </p>
<p>Oral arguments are to be heard Sept. 26 on Donziger and the
Ecuadorians'' request that the court remove Kaplan from the case
and cancel several orders he issued. </p>
<p>Kaplan said that Donziger had failed to request a delay
pending the appeals court''s decision soon enough. </p>
<p>The motion to delay the trial is without merit,
represents a radical change in defendants'' nominal position
(though it is entirely consistent with a years-old strategy of
delay wherever possible), and comes far too late, he said.
Notwithstanding their attempts to portray themselves as
Davids, each alone facing Goliath, the reality is quite
different. </p>
<p>Chevron asked that a jury determine what, if any,
compensatory and punitive monetary damages should be paid by
Donziger and asked Kaplan to determine what other remedies
should be imposed. </p>
<h2>Phase Two </h2>
<p>The company asked the judge to decide in a second phase of
the trial whether the Ecuadorians and Donziger should be barred
from further harming Chevron and to issue an order that protects
its assets. </p>
<p>The company also requested that the Lago Agrio plaintiffs
be prohibited from making what it called prejudicial statements
about alleged environmental issues in Ecuador. </p>
<p>Chevron denies there was company wrongdoing in the Lago
Agrio lawsuit, saying Texaco cleaned up its share of the
pollution at its former oil fields, which were taken over by
PetroEcuador, Ecuador''s state-owned oil company. Chevron said it
was released from any future liability by an agreement between
Texaco and Ecuador. Chevron acquired Texaco in 2001. </p>
<p>The racketeering case is Chevron v. Donziger, 11-00691,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).
The case in Ecuador is Aquinda v. Chevron, 002-2003, Superior
Court of Nueva Loja, Lago Agrio, Ecuador. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is shuffling the
management of its Windows division, a move that will leave
longtime executives Jon DeVaan and Antoine Leblond without
senior leadership roles, according to people with knowledge of
the changes. </p>
<p>Terry Myerson, who runs Windows and Windows Phone, is
reassigning executives in the newly joined software unit as part
of Microsoft''s companywide restructuring, said the people, who
asked not to be named because the moves haven''t been announced.
Henry Sanders, a Windows Phone executive, will lead development,
while Joe Belfiore, also from Windows Phone, will run a phone,
tablet and PC group, said one of the people. </p>
<p>Microsoft, the world''s largest software maker, is
overhauling its top ranks as Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer nears retirement. Ballmer, who said last month he will
leave within a year, in July rolled out the largest change to
the company''s executive staff in more than a decade. Those
picked as unit leaders by Ballmer are now setting up their own
leadership teams. </p>
<p>Leblond had been in charge of lining up applications for
Windows 8, Microsoft''s new operating system, which was
criticized for lacking some popular apps when it went on sale in
October. More recently he worked on the Windows 8.1 update to
the software. </p>
<p>DeVaan, a 29-year Microsoft veteran, was a vice president
in Windows development. It''s not clear if the two will take on
positions elsewhere in the company, stay in Windows, or leave
altogeter, the people said. </p>
<h2>Xbox Software </h2>
<p>Myerson, whose team also develops software for the Xbox and
the Xbox Live online service, picked Xbox executive Marc Whitten
to run those businesses, and Chris Jones will keep his current
job overseeing Windows services, the people said. </p>
<p>The Windows changes were reporter earlier by the All Things
D blog. Tony Imperati, a spokesman for Microsoft, declined to
comment. </p>
<p>To bolster its struggling mobile business, Microsoft agreed
last week to buy Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)''s handset business or $7.2 billion,
adding about 32,000 employees. </p>
<p>Microsoft will introduce new versions of its Surface tablet
at an event in New York on Sept. 23, according to an invitation
sent out by the company. While there has been speculation the
company might introduce a smaller Surface, no such device will
be unveiled at the event, said a person familiar with the
matter. Last quarter Microsoft took a $900 million charge
writedown on unsold Surface tablets. </p>
<p>The new products will include both a version for Intel
Corp. chips running Windows 8 and a version running Windows RT
on an Nvdia Corp. chip with ARM Holdings Plc (ARM) technology, the
person said. </p>
<p>Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, rose 1.6 percent
to $31.66 at the 4 p.m. close in New York. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is making its Xbox
Music service available on Android and iOS devices to compete
with Apple (AAPL) Inc.''s iTunes, Spotify Ltd. and Pandora Media Inc. (P) </p>
<p>The $9.99-a-month Xbox Music Pass, which provides
unlimited, advertising-free streaming, can be used today for the
first time on Apple iPhones and devices running Google Inc. (GOOG)''s
Android software, Scott Porter, principal program manager at
XBox Music, said in an interview. </p>
<p>The expansion gives Microsoft access to the biggest
smartphone platforms as it guns for the leaders in digital music
-- Spotify in subscription streaming, Pandora in Web radio, and
Apple''s iTunes for purchases. Microsoft introduced the service
in October on the Xbox 360 console and Windows 8 devices, saying
then it planned to add Android and iOS. </p>
<p>Music needs to be something that freely connects between
devices for users to be happy, Porter said. Windows users
spent time curating and discovering new music and we need to
give them access wherever they are. </p>
<p>Listeners can access Xbox Music on a smartphone, tablet,
Xbox 360 or the coming Xbox One video game console, Porter said.
A free, ad-supported online version allows tracks to be shared
with people who use an Apple PC, he said. </p>
<p>Microsoft, which is buying mobile-phone maker Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) for
$7.2 billion, trails iOS and Android. Windows accounted for 3.6
percent of worldwide smartphones at the end of June, according
to Bloomberg Industries data. That compares with 79 percent for
Android and 13 percent for Apple. </p>
<p>New Xbox Music features will be introduced when Microsoft
starts selling Windows 8.1 in October, Porter said. One such
addition will be a Web Playlist tool that grabs all the music on
a Web page to create a list of songs, he said. </p>
<p>Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, rose 1.6 percent
to $31.66 at the close in New York. The stock has gained 18
percent this year. </p>

Olson, a Piper Jaffray  Co. analyst. </p> <p>Shoppers bought 400,000 units, Olson said in a research note published today. First-week spending matched the debut of Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI)''s Skylanders Giants game, Olson said in an earlier note. That title was the top 2012 holiday children''s game, according to Activision. </p> <p>Sales have been excellent, beyond our expectations, said Richard Barry, chief merchandising officer at Toys R Us Inc., based in Wayne, New Jersey. Kids are really engaging in the brand. They are not only buying the software, but they are really engaging in the characters and the power discs. </p> <p>Infinity represents Disney''s biggest bet in video games, drawing on characters like Captain Jack Sparrow from its library of film hits. The company is counting on the product and follow-on sales to turn a profit at its interactive division, which lost $103 million through nine months of the current fiscal year. First-week purchases totaled 379,000, Olson said. </p> <p>Like Skylanders, Infinity integrates collectible figures with on-screen video-game play. Kids use the figures to create and play with characters using game consoles. </p> <p>Disney Infinity is having meaningful success at retail, Olson wrote in the earlier note. Clerks said the game is selling very well in 17 of 20 stores checked, he said. </p> <p>Disney, the world''s largest entertainment company, rose 0.3 percent to $61.59 at the close in New York. Shares of the Burbank, California-based company are up 24 percent this year. </p> <p>The Infinity product, including a base unit and three collectible characters, retails for $75. Additional toys and discs, providing more characters and features, sell for $5 to $13. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Christie Smythe" date="Sep 09, 2013  1:09 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-09/jpmorgan-reaches-insurance-accord-with-mortgage-borrowers.html"><headline>JPMorgan Reaches Insurance Accord With Mortgage Borrowers</headline><body><![CDATA[

<p>There''s more than a world chess championship at stake in
The Machine, Matt Charman''s play based on the 1997 re-match
between grandmaster Garry Kasparov and Deep Blue, the
computer that IBM (IBM) built to beat him. </p>
<p>Kasparov won the first duel a year earlier, and Deep Blue
returned with a chip on its shoulder. </p>
<p>The hall is tricked-out like a Las Vegas boxing arena, with
giant scoreboard, digital video screens and color commentators
bloviating from the wings. </p>
<p>All of which provides plenty of sizzle for very little
steak: As the match unfolds, Charman''s paint-by-numbers script
skips back in time to the parallel stories of Azerbaijan-born
Kasparov (the nuanced Hadley Fraser) and the computer''s chief
developer, Taiwan emigre Feng-Hsiung Hsu (Kenneth Lee, good in a
more one-note role). </p>
<p>Kasparov is a genius with mommy issues (the forceful
Francesca Annis). Hsu ignores his pretty cheerleader girlfriend
from Carnegie-Mellon (Antonia Bernath). Their passion lies
elsewhere, you see. </p>
<p>Charman toys with the idea that the man-versus-machine
showdown served a public relations purpose above all. But an
outsize set (Lucy Osborne) and snappy video (Andrzej Goulding)
don''t justify blowing such an intimate encounter so wildly out
of proportion. </p>

<p>A basic model of financial regulation is that it is a game in which (1) regulators write rules to stop banks from doing naughty things, and then (2) the banks sit down with a freshly printed copy of the rules and a bunch of lawyers and find ways to do the naughty things they were doing, plus some additional naughty things, all while technically complying with the new rules. Doing the naughty things tends to be more profitable than writing the regulations, so the banks have an upper hand in this game. </p><p>This is, I guess, a pretty cynical model? It doesn''t really have to be; many bankers actually think that what they do has social value, so they view regulatory efforts to slow them down as just impediments to progress. "This deal is risk-free and good for the world," they think, "so why should it be prevented by all these arbitrary risk limits?" Bankers are -- in their own estimation -- better stewards of capital than regulators, so it''s sort of understandable that they would try to do their jobs with as little regulatory interference as possible. </p><p>Anyway that''s always been my model and I''m rarely disappointed! Some examples of my absence of disappointment are in this footnote here.* But I was disappointed by today''s front-page Wall Street Journal article about Morgan Stanley because boy does it sound like Morgan Stanley is playing the game wrong:</p><blockquote>"Your No. 1 client is the government," John J. Mack, Morgan Stanley''s chairman and chief executive from 2005 to 2009, told current CEO James Gorman in a recent phone call. Mr. Gorman, who was visiting Washington that day, agreed. By both force and choice, Morgan Stanley has upended its culture and ethos. Go-go trading businesses once hailed as its future are gone or curtailed. In their place, the storied investment bank has embraced the retail-brokerage business -- peddling stocks and doling out financial advice to ordinary investors -- a less exclusive club more often associated with names like Merrill Lynch and Schwab. One small sign of the times: The cigar shop in the ground floor of Morgan Stanley''s Times Square headquarters, a favorite of former chairman Richard Fisher, decamped downtown in 2011 because business was poor. The space is now occupied by a bakery that sells minicupcakes.<blockquote/><p>It goes on and in a sense it''s all worth reading -- Sheila Bair, who''s pretty cynical about banks, is quoted saying "They''re not perfect, but there''s been real progress at that bank  Gorman has really tried to have a safer risk profile." Yet in another sense, you can stop with that cupcake anecdote. Regulatory arbitrage brainstorming sessions are not fueled by mini cupcakes. The ground floor of Goldman Sachs''s headquarters has a meth lab. (Not really.**)</p><p>So while of course it''s possible that this is just next-level perception manipulation and I''ve fallen for it -- that Morgan Stanley has found a novel way to take on immense amounts of complex risk and hide it behind an army of retail brokers and a layer of cream-cheese frosting -- I think that this story is what it appears to be. Morgan Stanley seems to be de-risking by cutting back on risky activities, and responding to new regulations by obeying them. </p><p>That''s ... I feel terrible saying this, but that''s weird. That''s not how it''s done. I mean, even now, that''s not how it''s done: Read the big Bloomberg News piece today about how underminey the banks have been about new financial regulation, or consider the mathematical manipulations that banks resort to to comply with new higher capital requirements. Or ponder how Goldman''s been sort of ignoring and evading the Volcker Rule, which bans proprietary trading by banks.*** Then ponder how Morgan Stanley''s dealing with it:</p><blockquote>Mr. Gorman says he regrets losing one business since the financial crisis -- the firm''s biggest and most consistent proprietary-trading desk, a quantitative-investment operation known as PDT. ... In 2007, the firm moved it to new, plusher digs in its headquarters to give it more space to make money. Five years later, PDT shut down, a casualty of the Volcker rule. <blockquote/><p>They had a business that they wanted to keep, and the rules said they couldn''t, and -- they shut it down. What an anticlimax. </p><p>It''s like Morgan Stanley really believes that the government is client number one, and that their aim is to please and delight, rather than just minimally appease, their regulators. It''s a fascinating experiment in part because it is an approach that is not, let us say, wholeheartedly shared by all of their peers. Morgan Stanley will be a good test case of whether a bank can be successful while taking the new regulatory environment seriously in the sense in which it is intended -- and also, perhaps, of whether that approach will actually make it safer.</p><p>* Just a couple:</p>
  Regulators required banks to hold capital against certain credit exposures from their derivatives contracts. Credit Suisse minimized that required capital by surreptitiously writing a derivative to itself to cover that credit risk, in a transaction that still makes me choke up from its sheer absurd beauty. (Later regulators caught on though.)
  JPMorgan did some quite astonishingly cynical exploitation of electricity-markets rules recently, basically on the theory of "well we didn''t write the rules, did we? You can''t blame us if they''re dumb and we noticed."
  The Volcker Rule is at this point just obviously a game. "You got us," the regulators probably chuckle, when Goldman finds a way to co-invest in private equity deals that obviously wasn''t intended -- though also obviously wasn''t expressly forbidden! -- by the rule. 
 <p>** But it does -- sort of -- have a Shake Shack. Also I mean: </p><blockquote>Fanning out from its headquarters bounded by Vesey and Murray Streets, next to the World Financial Center and a block northwest of ever-rising ground zero, there is now a kind of Goldman village anchored by Goldman Alley, as the locals call the public passageway between Vesey and Murray that''s shielded by a tilted glass canopy.In this Goldman-enabled world, any of its 8,000 employees can dart downstairs and acquire spicy onion rings at 1 a.m. Or, if the need arises during the day, pick up a Cymbidium orchid. Or grab a bottle of A. Edmond Audry Tres Ancienne Grande Champagne Cognac.<blockquote/><p>I assume that that is a flavor of cognac particularly conducive to dreaming up ways around the Volcker Rule. Possibly the orchids help too? </p><p>*** Boy you''re really gonna hate me when you realize you scrolled all the way down to this footnote only to find out that it''s just: see footnote 1. Footnote * I mean. Hyperlinks are coming I sort-of promise! Anyway here''s another Goldman Volcker thing for your trouble.</p>

to call meetings at any time, approve agendas and add agenda
items, and will guide the board in considering the succession of
chief executive officers, New York-based JPMorgan said yesterday
in a statement. </p>
<p>Investors in May rejected a proposal to split the chairman
and CEO roles, which advisory firms such as Institutional
Shareholder Services said would improve oversight. The bank said
yesterday that the board will hold executive sessions without
company management at every regular board meeting, make members
available to meet with major shareholders and won''t rotate the
lead independent director position every year. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, expects to elect
Bammann to the board on Sept. 16 and Neal will join in January
after he retires from his current position, according to the
statement. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is contending with criminal investigations of its
energy-trading and mortgage-backed securities operations. The
firm also faces U.S. probes of its anti-money-laundering
safeguards, foreclosures, credit-card collections and the London
Whale debacle. </p>
<p>The bank has made bolstering regulatory compliance and
internal controls its priority this year, Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon, has said. </p>

<h2>Compliance Policy </h2>
<h2>Mexico''s Pena Nieto Seeks Capital Gains, High Earners Taxes </h2>
<p>Mexico''s President Enrique Pena Nieto is proposing taxes on
capital gains, sugary drinks and the nation''s highest earners in
a bid to wean Latin America''s second-largest economy off its
dependence on oil revenue. </p>
<p>The bill sent to congress Sept. 8 along with the
president''s 2014 budget proposal would place a 10 percent tax on
individuals'' profits from stock sales and dividends, raise the
maximum personal income tax rate to 32 percent from 30 percent
and avoid taxing food and medicine. The measures would help
offset a proposed lower tax burden for state-owned oil producer
Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, and help pay for universal social
security and unemployment insurance. </p>
<p>Ratings companies will probably be disappointed by the
decision not to tax food and medicine, while some government
bond investors may be hurt as additional debt issuance boosts
supply of the securities, said Alonso Cervera, the chief Mexico
economist at Credit Suisse Group AG. </p>
<p>The tax bill would increase government revenue, according
to the bill. </p>
<p>Pena Nieto has pledged to boost tax collection as part of a
series of economic overhauls to speed up growth that''s 40
percent slower than the regional average over the past five
years. Income from Pemex crude sales funds about a third of the
federal budget. </p>
<p>The reform would end a tax benefit, known as fiscal
consolidation, which allows holding companies to postpone paying
taxes when their subsidiaries post losses. Companies with the
largest deferred tax assets, and thus may be the most affected,
are America Movil (AMXL) SAB, Cemex SAB, Arca Continental SAB (AC*), Empresas
ICA SAB (ICA*) and Grupo Bimbo SAB (BIMBOA), JPMorgan Chase  Co. said in a
Sept. 6 research note. </p>

<h2>Tin Smelters in Indonesia Pushing for JFX Trade Permits </h2>
<p>Smelters and Jakarta Futures Exchange are expected to meet
with the Trade Ministry this week to push for permits to trade
physical tin contracts, said M.B. Gunawan, director and general
manager at PT Stanindo Inti Perkasa, a metals manufacturer. </p>
<p>Smelters stopped operations and won''t resume until the
Futures Exchange gets trading permits or the government delays
the rule, Gunawan said by phone from Jakarta yesterday. </p>
<p>Miners halted work because they can''t sell ore, he said. </p>
<p>Smelters met last week. Most are not interested in joining
the Indonesia Commodity and Derivatives Exchange, Gunawan said.
They prefer the Futures Exchange because they can show their
brand and interact directly with buyers, he said. The Futures
Exchange will display smelters'' brands on the trading system,
according to Gunawan. </p>
<h2>Compliance Action </h2>
<h2>FDIC to Sell $2.42 Billion of Citigroup Debt to End Rescue Stake </h2>
<p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is selling $2.42
billion of bonds issued by Citigroup Inc. (C) in a transaction that
will eliminate U.S. government holdings in the bank linked to
the 2008 financial crisis. </p>
<p>Citigroup exchanged the subordinated notes due 2025 and
2043 to the FDIC for other securities used to pay the government
for $301 billion of asset guarantees, the New York-based bank
said yesterday in a regulatory filing. Citigroup won''t receive
any proceeds from the resale to the public. </p>
<p>The offering is the latest step to end taxpayer support for
Citigroup, which took more bailout assistance than any other
U.S. lender. </p>
<p>When the transaction concludes, no U.S. government entity
will continue to hold any securities in Citi issued as a result
of the financial crisis, Mark Costiglio, a spokesman for the
lender, said by e-mail. The government''s investment realized a
return of more than $13 billion, he said. </p>
<p>Citigroup issued a combined $7.06 billion in preferred
shares to the FDIC and the Treasury as consideration for the
loss-sharing protection, provided to help shore up investor
confidence in the bank during the worst financial crisis since
the Great Depression. The Treasury said in February that it
expected to receive $894 million in proceeds from a similar
offering. </p>
<p>David Barr, a spokesman at the FDIC, declined to comment on
the transaction. </p>
<h2>Hewlett-Packard Says Polish Regulators Join Bribery Probe </h2>
<p>Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) said the Polish Anti-Corruption Bureau
joined an investigation by U.S. regulators into potential
violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by the computer
maker. </p>
<p>The probe, along with the U.S. Department of Justice and
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, centers on an employee
of Hewlett-Packard''s Polska unit and public sector
transactions in Poland, according to a regulatory filing
yesterday. </p>
<p>The agencies are also investigating public-sector
transactions in Russia, Mexico and other countries that
weren''t named, according to the filing. The Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act, or FCPA, makes it illegal for U.S. business
people to bribe foreign officials. </p>
<h2>Courts </h2>
<h2>Reserve Primary Fund Settles Shareholder Suit for $54.9 Million </h2>
<p>Bruce R. Bent II, president of the $62.5 billion Reserve
Primary money-market fund that failed during the financial
crisis, agreed to settle a shareholder lawsuit in an accord
worth about $54.9 million. </p>
<p>Bent and his father, Bruce R. Bent, are among defendants
that agreed to pay $10 million in cash, drop their claim for
$42.4 million from a court-established expense fund, and to
allow $2.5 million from the expense fund to go to shareholders.
None of the defendants admitted wrongdoing as part of the
proposed settlement to end a class-action lawsuit led by Third
Avenue Institutional International Value Fund LP. </p>
<p>The suit was filed in September 2008, two days after Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. went bankrupt in the midst of the worst
U.S. economic crisis since the Great Depression. The Reserve
Primary money-market fund held $785 million in Lehman debt. A
run on the fund triggered its failure when it broke the buck
by failing to maintain a $1-a-share net asset value. </p>
<p>A federal jury found Bruce Bent II negligent on one claim
of violating a securities law. His father was absolved of all
claims in a suit by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>
<p>The fund''s closing sparked an investor run on similar money
funds, contributing to a freeze among global credit markets. </p>
<p>The settlement is subject to court approval. </p>
<p>The case is Reserve Primary Fund Securities  Derivative
Class Action Litigation, 08-cv-08060. The SEC case is SEC v.
Reserve Management Co., 09-cv-04346, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<h2>Interviews </h2>
<h2>Secret Swiss Accounts No Longer Safe Tax Dodge, Prosecutor Says </h2>
<p>Taxpayers who still believe they can hide secret Swiss bank
accounts from the Internal Revenue Service are beyond
foolish, the top U.S. tax prosecutor said as a five-year
crackdown expands to new offshore havens. </p>
<p>The enforcement drive has forced a remarkable change in
the ability of the U.S. to find secret accounts in Switzerland,
the world''s largest offshore financial center with about $2.2
trillion of assets, said Kathryn Keneally, assistant attorney
general in the Justice Department''s tax division. </p>
<p>If someone had an account in Switzerland, it is beyond
foolish to think that that account is going to remain secret,
said Keneally, 55. In the last five years, we''ve seen a
remarkable change in our ability to get information concerning
Swiss bank accounts. It''s extraordinary. Switzerland is no
longer a good place to hide assets for tax reasons. </p>
<p>Keneally, in her first interview since taking the job in
April 2012, said a new U.S. amnesty program for Swiss banks to
disclose how they aided tax evasion puts taxpayers and offshore
enablers at risk of prosecution. Since 2009, the U.S. has
prosecuted 68 U.S. taxpayers, three Swiss banks, and 30 bankers,
lawyers, and advisers. Another 38,000 Americans moved $5.5
billion to the U.S. and avoided prosecution by saying who helped
them offshore. </p>
<p>Fourteen firms are under criminal investigation. On Aug.
29, the U.S. announced a program for other Swiss banks to avoid
charges. They must pay penalties and disclose their cross-border
activities, among other measures. Banks that don''t come forward
by the Dec. 31 deadline could face criminal charges, Keneally
said. </p>
<p>We have investigations and activities that will be coming
in other parts of the world that I can''t comment on right now,
she said. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world''s largest computer-services provider, agreed to
sell its customer-care outsourcing business to Synnex Corp. (SNX) for
$505 million to focus on more profitable investments. </p>
<p>Synnex will pay $430 million in cash and $75 million in
stock, giving IBM a stake in Synnex, the companies said in
statements yesterday. The unit had $1.3 billion in 2012 sales,
accounting for more than 1 percent of IBM''s revenue. Synnex
shares jumped to a record intraday price. </p>
<p>IBM is getting rid of businesses with lower profit margins
to reach a goal of $20 a share in earnings by 2015, up from
$15.25 last year. The company last year sold its retail-store
systems unit to Toshiba Tec Corp. (6588) for $850 million. IBM has had
talks with Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) about selling its division that
makes standard X86 servers, which have become a commodity item
amid increasing competition, people familiar with the matter
said earlier this year. </p>
<p>As you look at our strategy, we continue to move our
business and transform our business to the higher-value
spaces, said Lori Steele, general manager of IBM Global
Process Services, in an interview. We''re trying to focus on
software and analytics. </p>
<p>The company, based in Armonk, New York, said earlier this
year that it would sell assets to make up for a $1 billion
charge to cut jobs. IBM excluded the charge from its 2013
earnings forecast, saying future divestitures would make up for
the expense. </p>
<h2>Lower Margins </h2>
<p>The customer service unit had a gross profit margin of
about 20 percent, IBM Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge
said in a presentation to investors earlier this year. That
compares with margins of about 60 percent for newer businesses
like analytics and cloud computing. </p>
<p>Synnex, based in Fremont, California, said the transaction
will add 55 cents in earnings per share in the first 12 months
after it closes the deal. Its shares jumped more than 20 percent
to $57.59 at the close in New York, an all-time high. IBM rose
2.2 percent to $190.70. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) hired Neil Moge from JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) to lead a London-based team
overseeing investments for insurers amid an expansion of asset
management in Europe. </p>
<p>Moge was named executive director and head of insurance
portfolio management for Europe, the Middle East and Africa,
according to a memo last month from Mike Siegel, global head of
Goldman Sachs''s insurance asset management unit. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets, and
No. 1 JPMorgan are among firms vying to manage money for
insurance companies facing pressure from low bond yields and new
regulation. New York-based Goldman Sachs manages $133 billion
for insurance clients, according to June 30 figures on the
company''s website. </p>
<p>Neil will play an integral role as we continue to expand
our insurance business in Europe and the United Kingdom,
Siegel said in the memo. Neil has an extensive background in
investment management for insurance companies. </p>
<p>Moge had been an executive director at New York-based
JPMorgan''s global insurance solutions team, where he managed
client relationships. Prior to joining JPMorgan, he was an
investment director at RSA Insurance Group Plc and also held
money-management roles at Axa SA and Prudential Plc''s MG
business, according to the memo. </p>
<p>He will report to John Melvin, chief investment officer of
the insurance asset management unit, and Iain Lindsay, co-head
of global fixed income portfolio management. Moge has a
bachelor''s degree in history and a master''s in medieval studies
from the University of Bristol in the U.K. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s asset management unit in June announced the
hiring in London of Prashant Sharma from Goldman Sachs as head
of international fixed-income investments for insurance clients.
Kristen Chambers, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined to
comment on the departure. She said the company has about $90

solutions business. </p>

African Oil-Law Changes to Deter Investment</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA) and other energy companies operating in South Africa
said planned changes to mineral and energy laws lack clarity and
will deter investment in the continent''s largest economy. </p>
<p>Changes to the 2002 Mineral and Petroleum Resources
Development Act, being processed by parliament, would give the
state an unspecified free stake in all new oil and gas ventures
and the right to name two directors to their boards. The state
would be able to force mine operators to process some output
locally and declare some minerals strategic to secure supplies. </p>
<p>The changes may significantly impact on the ability of
investors to continue exploration in South Africa, Russ
Berkoben, president of Exxon''s local unit, told lawmakers in
Cape Town today. The government is sending a message to
investors that their high-risk investment will have a much lower
reward. A lot of work has to be done. </p>
<p>South Africa, closed to foreign investment until apartheid
ended in 1994, is seeking to develop its oil resources to boost
and diversify an economy with a 25.6 percent unemployment rate.
While Irving, Texas-based Exxon and Shell have stakes in
offshore blocks, extraction is yet to take off. The country
imports 70 percent of its oil needs, processing the remainder of
its fuels from coal and gas. </p>
<h2>Excessive Discretion </h2>
<p>Parliament''s mineral resources committee began four days of
public hearings on the draft bill today. On July 30, officials
from the Department of Mineral Resources told lawmakers they
were winning over business to the new laws and they didn''t
expect the regulations to hurt investment. </p>
<p>Shell said the proposed bill gives the mineral resources
minister excessive regulatory discretion and doesn''t clarify the
size of stake the state intends to take in new energy ventures. </p>
<p>For a country to attract investment in the exploration of
oil and gas, the financial risks need to be balanced with stable
and transparent legislation that provides benefits to investors
and meets the country''s aspirations, The Hague-based Shell
said in its submission. The bill''s deficiencies could lead to
significant delays in planned investment. </p>
<p>Marek Ranoszek, managing director of Anadarko Petroleum
Corp. (APC)''s South African unit, told lawmakers the draft law failed
to protect the rights and expectations of mineral permit holders
and may lead investors to reconsider plans for oil and gas
exploration. </p>
<h2>Wider Deficit </h2>
<p>The potential costs to the country in terms of job
creation, energy security, energy diversification and revenue to
the fiscus will be in the order of billions of rands, Ranoszek
said. Johannesburg-based Sasol Ltd. (SOL), the world''s largest
producer of motor fuel from coal, several other energy companies
and business lobby groups also rejected the bill on the grounds
that it''s unclear and would hamper investment. </p>
<p>South Africa relies on foreign capital to fund its current-account deficit, which widened to 6.5 percent of gross domestic
product last quarter as a weaker rand failed to damp imports and
boost exports. </p>
<p>The draft law has also drawn objections from mining
companies. </p>
<p>Anglo American Plc, the largest investor in South African
mining, and Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP), the world''s second-largest platinum producer, said in written submissions that the
bill introduced legislative uncertainty and would fail to
achieve its aims of encouraging local processing. </p>
<h2>Legal Obligations </h2>
<p>The measures may also flout South Africa''s international
legal obligations, said London-based Anglo American, which is
due to address the committee on Sept. 18. </p>
<p>Fund-management companies Allan Gray Ltd. and Sanlam
Investment Management, both based in Cape Town, said many of the
law''s provisions would discourage investment in mining and
energy at a time when resources companies are struggling
worldwide. </p>
<p>Stagnating economies have eroded demand for commodities
from metals to fuels, sending the Standard  Poor''s GSCI Spot
Index (SPGSCI) of 24 raw materials down 4.8 percent in the past 12
months. </p>
<p>Provisions in the bill aimed at encouraging local mineral
processing may lead to the construction of unviable plants,
while restraints on exports would undermine businesses'' ability
to reap maximum revenue, Allan Gray said in its submission. </p>
<p>Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., the state power company, said coal
should be declared a strategic mineral and exports of some
grades should only be permitted after being offered to domestic
energy producers at a cost that provided for fair returns. </p>
<p>Eskom also urged lawmakers to ensure it and other domestic
utilities were consulted prior to the awarding, granting and
renewal of coal exploration and mining licenses, and they had
first right of refusal on forfeited exploration rights. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), whose $186.60 share price and 2.6 percent loss in 2013
combined to restrain the Dow Jones Industrial Average more than
any other stock, is about to have its influence diluted. </p>
<p>The world''s biggest seller of computer services will see
its proportion in the gauge cut to 7.9 percent from 9.4 percent
when Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Visa Inc. (V) and Nike Inc. (NKE) are added
this month. Goldman and Visa, at $165.14 and $184.59, become the
second- and third-most influential members of the Dow, which is
weighted according to stock price rather than market value. </p>
<p>Reducing IBM''s influence was part of the rationale for
picking Goldman, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, and
Visa, the largest payment network, according to David Blitzer,
chairman of the SP Dow Jones index committee, which announced
the actions yesterday. Had they been in the gauge all year, the
Dow would be up 17.3 percent instead of 15.9 percent, data based
on yesterday''s prices compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>IBM''s sway over the Dow has been reason enough not to
consider it a good reflection of the stock market, according
to Mark Luschini, the Philadelphia-based chief investment
strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, which oversees $58
billion. On certain days I''ll walk out, and I''ll know to the
right of the decimal where the SP 500 index closed. But I won''t
know if the Dow Jones industrial average is above 15,000. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the nation''s largest bank by assets, is easing mortgage lending standards in housing markets hard hit by the crash where prices are surging. </p> <p>The bank lowered some down payment requirements in Florida, Nevada, Arizona and Michigan because they will no longer be considered distressed states, it informed smaller lenders it buys loans from in July. The second-largest U.S. mortgage lender also loosened underwriting requirements for a refinancing program for Federal Housing Administration borrowers. </p> <p>As the economy rebounds and home values climb at about the fastest pace since 2006, lenders including the largest, Wells Fargo (WFC)  Co., JPMorgan, Bank of America Corp. (BAC), and mortgage insurers are easing the tightest credit conditions in two decades, lifting restrictions put in place after the worst real estate bust since the Great Depression. Banks are being forced to compete harder for customers after a spike in borrowing costs from near-record lows slowed refinancing by more than 70 percent and curbed what had been record profits. </p> <p>Historically, you make underwriting as tough as possible when people are lined up at the door and when the lines go away, you start loosening underwriting to get people back, said Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance. </p> <h2>Fed Survey </h2> <p>More than 10 percent of banks reported they loosened standards on prime or low-risk residential loans in recent months, according to the Federal Reserve''s July survey of senior loan officers. The average FICO score for closed loans fell to 737 in July, the lowest level since at least August 2011, according to data compiled by Pleasanton, California-based Ellie Mae. Borrowers loan-to-value and debt-to-income ratios also increased from May, signaling lenders are willing to accept more risk to maintain volume. </p> <p>Wells Fargo, which originated about 1 in 4 U.S. home loans in the first half of the year, has relaxed certain credit standards and is requiring borrowers to put up less equity to buy high-priced homes. </p> <p>The San Francisco-based bank began, on July 13, to offer nonconforming loans with a loan-to-value ratio of 85 percent, up from 80 percent, according to Tom Goyda, a bank spokesman. That means borrowers have to come up with less equity to get financing. The terms on the loans, which are too large for purchase by Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac, apply for new home purchases and refinancing, and don''t require mortgage insurance, Goyda said in an e-mail. </p> <h2>Total Picture'' </h2> <p>Getting approved for a home loan hinges on a borrower''s total financial picture, Goyda said in an e-mailed statement. We are always evaluating our credit standards in light of market conditions and trends. </p> <p>Goyda declined to provide further details on where Wells Fargo has eased underwriting restrictions. </p> <p>JPMorgan removed a minimum 640 credit score requirement for the FHA''s streamlined refinancing program in May, enabling more borrowers to get new home loans at lower interest rates, according to spokeswoman Amy Bonitatibus. </p> <p>Banks are trying to lure more borrowers as mortgage applications plunged last week to a five-year low. Refinancing dropped more than 20 percent, the lowest since June 2009. The industry benefitted from record profit margins last year, when refinancing accounted for 76 percent of last year''s $1.75 trillion in loan originations. </p> <p>JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon told investors in July that rising interest rates could trigger a dramatic reduction in the bank''s mortgage profits after mortgage fees and related revenue at the bank dropped 20 percent to $1.82 billion in the second quarter, compared with $2.27 billion a year earlier. </p> <h2>Eliminating Jobs </h2> <p>An increase in lending for home purchases won''t be enough to replace a drop in refinancings, JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said in a presentation at an investor conference this week. The bank''s pretax-profit margins and income on mortgage lending will be slightly negative in the third and fourth quarters as the firm takes time to adjust its fixed costs. The firm is eliminating as many as 19,000 jobs in its mortgage and community-banking divisions through 2014 as Dimon trims expenses, JPMorgan said in February. </p> <p>We continuously review our lending standards to help families buy homes they can afford over the long term, Bonitatibus said. We have responded to improvements in the housing market by removing some additional requirements we put in place in hard-hit markets during the crisis. </p> <p>Bank of America has been easing underwriting standards in markets it designated as soft in certain parts of the country as the housing market improves, said Kris Yamamoto, a company spokeswoman. </p> <h2>Loosened Credit </h2> <p>Since Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke indicated the central bank may slow its purchases of government and mortgage bonds, the average rate on 30-year home loans has risen more than 1.2 percentage points after hitting a low of 3.35 percent in May, according to Freddie Mac data. </p> <p>Loosened mortgage credit would offset some of the impact of rising rates, which make homeownership more expensive, said Jed Kolko, chief economist at San Francisco-based property-listings service Trulia Inc. Because rates are rising, demand for refinancing has plummeted and some banks have suggested that would open up capacity for home-purchase lending. </p> <p>The U.S. homeownership rate fell to 65 percent this year, its lowest level since 1995, according to Census Bureau data, as fewer people were able to qualify for a mortgage. Banks are starting to ease credit with home prices across the country rising 12.1 percent in June from a year earlier, according to the SP/Case-Shiller index of 20 cities. </p> <h2>Cash Buyers </h2> <p>Prices in some of the hardest-hit markets have rebounded faster. Las Vegas gained 24.9 percent, Phoenix showed a 19.8 percent increase, Detroit rose 16.4 percent Miami-area values were up 14.8 percent. </p> <p>Private-equity firms such as Blackstone Group LP building rental businesses and other cash buyers have helped lift house prices in cities showing some of the biggest gains. Their mass purchases have made it more difficult for borrowers seeking mortgage financing, as they compete for a shrinking supply of properties. </p> <p>In Florida, lenders including JPMorgan and mortgage insurers this year removed many of the additional requirements that had helped to push the share of cash buyers above 45 percent in the second quarter, said Rob Nunziata, co-Chief Executive Officer of FBC Mortgage LLC. </p> <h2>Florida Downpayments </h2> <p>JPMorgan decreased the minimum downpayment on mortgages made in Florida for primary residences to 5 percent from 10 percent and down to 10 percent from 20 percent for second homes, according to Bonitatibus. </p> <p>Those restrictions have handcuffed Florida buyers, Nunziata said, also referring to mortgage insurers and banks. When you had restrictions telling buyers they had to put down an extra 5 to 15 percent in some cases, that eliminated a lot of potential buyers from qualifying. </p> <p>Mortgage insurers that restricted coverage during the housing crisis, including MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG) and Genworth Financial Inc. (GNW), have eased underwriting guidelines this year as the market improves. </p> <p>During the crash, borrowers in California, Florida, Nevada and Arizona needed a credit score of at least 700 and could have a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 90 percent to qualify for mortgage insurance with MGIC, said Sal Miosi, vice president of marketing at the Milwaukee-based firm. </p> <h2>Added Complexity </h2> <p>Last month, the third-largest U.S. mortgage insurer limited rules so borrowers whose loans qualify for purchase by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac with credit scores of at least 620 and a loan-to-value ratio up to 97 percent can get insurance coverage, according to Miosi. </p> <p>Additional restrictions weren''t contributing to the credit quality, they were just adding to complexity, he said. </p> <p>Genworth Financial Inc., the fourth-largest mortgage insurer in the country, broadened credit guidelines in the first quarter of 2013 and reduced pricing, Rohit Gupta, chief executive officer of the company''s U.S. mortgage insurance business, said in an e-mailed statement. </p> <p>Banks are still taking a cautious credit posture, according to David H. Stevens, CEO of the Mortgage Bankers Association. </p> <p>You''re starting from a very narrow market, so any expansion wouldn''t go near the reckless lending practices of the early 2000s, he said. We''re in the most conservative overall credit environment for housing finance that we''ve seen in almost three decades. </p> <h2>Risky Lending </h2> <p>A decrease in access for interest-only loans and those with terms longer than 30 years led to a slide in a Mortgage Bankers Association measure of loan availability last month. </p> <p>Those types of loans are less attractive to banks as planned rules created by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to curb abusive or risky lending kick in next year. </p> <p>Credit has been loosening faster for the wealthiest Americans, since bigger loans are mostly put on bank balance sheets instead of packaged into securities that get sold to investors. Applications for jumbo mortgages of at least $729,000 increased 59 percent in the first four months from a year earlier. Loans of less than $150,000, fell by 2.1 percent, according to the MBA. </p> <p>President Barack Obama''s administration has been pushing to expand homeownership opportunities as families rebuilding from the recession face some of the tightest underwriting standards. The president last month introduced new housing reforms targeted at middle-class communities. </p> <p>Borrowers with foreclosures or bankruptcies resulting from a job or income loss can now finance a home purchase with an FHA mortgage as long as they demonstrate 12 months of timely payments, complete housing counseling and otherwise qualify. The FHA, a government mortgage insurer, previously required a three-year wait. </p> <p>More than 7 million houses have been sold for a loss or lost to foreclosure since 2007, according to RealtyTrac. </p> <p>The reaction post-bust was a bit extreme but we''re returning to more prudent underwriting standards, said Erin Lantz, director of mortgages at Seattle-based Zillow Inc. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Will Kennedy" date="Sep 11, 2013  9:09 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-11/exxon-charged-with-illegally-dumping-waste-water-in-pennsylvania.html"><headline>Exxon Charged With Illegally Dumping Waste in Pennsylvania</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world''s
largest energy company, was charged with illegally dumping more
than 50,000 gallons (189,000 liters) of wastewater at a shale-gas drilling site in Pennsylvania. </p>
<p>Exxon unit XTO Energy Inc. discharged the water from waste
tanks at the Marquandt well site in Lycoming County in 2010,
according to a statement on the website of Pennsylvania''s
attorney general. The pollution was found during an unannounced
visit by the state''s Department of Environmental Protection. </p>
<p>The inspectors discovered a plug removed from a tank,
allowing the wastewater to run onto the ground, polluting a
nearby stream. XTO was ordered to remove 3,000 tons of soil to
clean up the area. Wastewater discharged from natural-gas wells
can contain chlorides, barium, strontium and aluminum, the
attorney general''s statement showed. </p>
<p>Criminal charges are unwarranted and legally baseless,
the XTO unit said yesterday in a statement posted on its
website. There was no intentional, reckless or negligent
misconduct by XTO. </p>
<p>Pennsylvania has become one of the biggest gas-producing
states in the past five years as explorers drill the Marcellus
shale, a rock formation stretching across the northeast U.S.
that holds 24 percent of the nation''s shale gas reserves,
according to the Energy Information Administration. Exxon agreed
to buy XTO in 2009 for $34.9 billion. </p>
<p>XTO was charged with five counts of unlawful conduct under
the Clean Streams Law and three counts under the Solid Waste
Management Act. </p>
<h2>Legal Risks </h2>
<p>Charging XTO under these circumstances could discourage
good environmental practices, the company said in its
statement. This action tells oil and gas operators that
setting up infrastructure to recycle produced water exposes them
to the risk of significant legal and financial penalties should
a small release occur. </p>
<p>The company said it acted quickly to clean up the spill
and there was no lasting environmental impact, according to
the statement. </p>
<p>XTO said it agreed to pay reasonable civil penalties in
a July 18, 2013 settlement with the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency and the Department of Justice. It also agreed
to recycle at least half its drilling wastewater, according to
the agreement. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its
12-month forecast for commodity returns, predicting a decline in
precious metals, agriculture and energy. The bank kept its
neutral recommendation on raw materials. </p>
<p>The Standard  Poor''s GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index will
drop 2 percent, compared with an increase of 0.1 percent
expected in July, analysts led by New York-based Jeffrey Currie
said in a report today. Energy, with a 73.5 percent weighting,
will probably fall 1 percent, while precious metals slide 15
percent and agriculture declines 7 percent, they said.
Industrial metals may increase 2 percent. </p>
<p>The gauge advanced 2.9 percent this year through Sept. 9 on
speculation the U.S. may launch a military strike on Syria in
retaliation for what it said was use of chemical weapons.
President Barack Obama has since asked Congress to postpone a
vote on military action while he pursues a diplomatic solution.
JPMorgan Chase  Co. said Sept. 6 it turned overweight on
commodities because of an improvement in manufacturing, better
demand and more optimism over China. </p>
<p>Investors will probably make more profits buying and
rolling front-end futures, rather than purchasing one year out
and holding to maturity, the analysts said. We expect this
strong positive carry to offset these declines, leaving returns
mostly flat over the next year. Accordingly, we are maintaining
our neutral recommendation on commodities. </p>
<p>West Texas Intermediate crude climbed 17 percent this year
to $107.10 a barrel while gold for immediate delivery dropped 18
percent to $1,366.88 an ounce. </p>

<p>A former securities analyst
extradited to the U.S. from Hong Kong in March pleaded guilty to
his role in an insider trading scheme involving International
Business Machines Corp. (IBM)''s $1.2 billion acquisition of SPSS Inc. </p>
<p>Trent Martin, 34, an Australian citizen, entered his plea
to a single count of conspiracy in a hearing today before U.S.
District Judge Andrew L. Carter Jr. in Manhattan. Martin told
Carter that he made about $7,600 from trading on the tip, which
he received from an unidentified attorney working on the deal. </p>
<p>I knew my actions were wrong and in violation of the law
and I apologize to the court for my conduct, Martin said
today. </p>
<p>Martin, who faces as much as five years in prison when he''s
sentenced on March 14, is cooperating with the government in
hopes of leniency. Carter agreed to a request by lawyers for
both sides that he be allowed to return to Sydney until he''s
sentenced. Martin will probably face deportation to Australia as
a result of the guilty plea, Carter said. </p>
<p>Martin said he received the tip from the lawyer, a close
friend, in June 2009. He shared the information with his
Manhattan roommate, Thomas Conradt, who was a stockbroker.
Conradt passed the information to his co-worker and friend David
Weishaus, who in turn tipped two other brokers. </p>
<h2>Securities Fraud </h2>
<p>Conradt pleaded guilty in April to one count of conspiracy
and two counts of securities fraud. Weishaus has pleaded not
guilty. </p>
<p>Martin worked at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in the
U.S. and an RBS joint venture in Australia before joining Nomura
Holdings Inc. (8604) in September 2011, according to two people
familiar with the situation who asked not to be identified
because they aren''t authorized to speak about the matter. </p>
<p>The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority lists a Trent
Martin who left ABN Amro Bank NV in 2009 to work at the Stamford
office of RBS, which participated in ABN Amro''s takeover in
2007. Martin''s broker registration at RBS ended in November
2010, Finra documents show. </p>

<p>Sasol Ltd. (SOL), the largest producer of
motor fuel from coal, urged South Africa to say what size stakes
it plans to take in new energy ventures under proposed changes
to the law as a way to reduce industry opposition. </p>
<p>Parliament''s mineral resources committee is holding public
hearings into amendments that would give the state a holding in
new oil and gas projects, a plan that has drawn opposition from
companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (RDSA) </p>
<p>We don''t know what the percentage is, Johan Thyse,
Sasol''s head of public policy and regulatory affairs, told
lawmakers today in Cape Town. Concerns may be easily
remedied by spelling out the maximum stake, he said. </p>
<p>The country imports 70 percent of its oil needs, with the
rest produced by processing coal and gas. Shell will soon decide
on whether to invest 4 billion rand ($400 million) to 5 billion
rand in South Africa and is concerned about the proposed changes
to the regulatory regime, Jan Willem Eggink, general manager for
upstream operations in South Africa, told lawmakers. </p>
<p>Shell''s plans include drilling an offshore exploratory well
in the Orange Basin off the country''s west coast, and onshore
drilling for shale gas in the southern Karoo region. </p>
<p>We need certainty today on what the rules of the game
are, Eggink said. We need a fair return on investment. </p>
<p>The chance of commercial success for exploration projects
is about 10 percent to 30 percent and risks and rewards should
be shared among all participants, Thyse said. Companies spend
typically $10 million to $30 million on offshore seismic data
and $50 million to $100 million on exploration drilling, and
should be able to recoup some of that from the state, he said. </p>
<p>The government''s proposed amendments are to South Africa''s
2002 Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act. </p>

<p>Stocks will continue to rally as
the bull market in equities moves into a new phase driven by
earnings growth rather than expanding valuations, according to
strategists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>Equities will produce more moderate returns with lower
volatility in the second phase of the bull market, according to
Peter Oppenheimer, Goldman''s chief global equity strategist, who
reiterated his bullish stance on stocks. Oppenheimer said in a
March 2012 report that the prospects for returns from equities
versus bonds are as good as they have been in a generation. </p>
<p>Accommodative monetary policies from central banks have
helped extend the bull market in U.S. stocks into a fifth year.
The Standard  Poor''s 500 Index has rallied 150 percent since
March 2009, driven by three rounds of bond purchases by the
Federal Reserve and better-than-forecast earnings by companies.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index has surged 96 percent in the same
period, while the MSCI World Index has climbed 123 percent. </p>
<p>Eighteen months on, we continue to believe the case for
equities remains strong, albeit with returns likely to be more
muted in the months ahead, London-based Oppenheimer wrote in a
report dated yesterday. The driver from here is likely to be
earnings growth rather than valuation expansion from current
levels, consistent with the growth phase of the equity cycle. </p>

<p>Russia''s credit risk is lower than
markets are pricing in because the world''s biggest energy
exporter has strong earnings from oil sales and a low debt
burden in its favor, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>The contracts, which insure against a default, are 25 basis
points more expensive than the average of 10 developing-nation
peers and should trade at least on par, Clemens Grafe, an
economist at Goldman Sachs in Moscow, said yesterday. Russia''s
credit-default swaps climbed 44 basis points since May 22 to
180, compared with a 46-basis point increase to 176 for Brazil
and an advance of 51 to 218 for South Africa, all ranked BBB at
Standard  Poor''s and Fitch Ratings. </p>
<p>Investors probably haven''t taken into account Russia''s
current account surplus, driven by energy exports, while other
nations run deficits, Grafe said. Emerging-market credit default
swaps climbed, indicating rising investor perceptions of risk,
and bonds sold off after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke signaled in May that quantitative easing could be pared
amid signs of an improving U.S. economy. </p>
<p>Russia is obviously the one that has the least problems
on the external front, Grafe said by phone yesterday. The
market has aligned Russia with the wrong part of the peer group.
Russia certainly should outperform its peers in this
environment. </p>
<h2>Oil Boost </h2>
<p>Russia ran a current account surplus equivalent to 3
percent of gross domestic product at the end of the first
quarter, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Brazil had a 3 percent
deficit in the period, while South Africa ran a 5.8 percent
shortfall. Russia has $510.8 billion of gold and foreign-currency reserves. </p>
<p>Crude jumped to $116.61 per barrel in London on Aug. 28,
the highest since 2008, on concern a U.S. strike on Syria would
lead to supply disruptions in the Middle East. The oil and
natural gas industries contribute about 50 percent of Russia''s
government revenue. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is due to
meet counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Geneva today to discuss a
Russian initiative to place Syria''s chemical weapons arsenal
under international control. </p>
<p>Historically Russia''s credit risk traded in line with the
peer group average, Grafe said. It has the lowest external
financial requirements out of all emerging markets with the
exception probably of China. </p>
<h2>Auction Sell-out </h2>
<p>Russia is robust and protected given only 4 percent of
its foreign debt is due in the short-term and the total is
equivalent to 31 percent of GDP, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote
in a report dated June 13. </p>
<p>The Finance Ministry sold out two auctions of ruble bonds
yesterday as the possibility of U.S. military action subsided,
boosting investor appetite for riskier assets. </p>
<p>On Sept. 9, Russia sold the most foreign debt this year
among emerging-market nations with a $7 billion placement in
dollars and euros. Investor demand was more than double the
amount offered, Andrey Solovyev, the head of debt capital
markets at VTB Capital, which arranged the sale with five other
banks, said Sept. 10. </p>
<p>Russia''s CDS need to rise a further 15 basis points to be a
tempting investment because of the country''s exposure to oil-price movements, Konstantin Artemov, who manages $500 million of
fixed-income funds at Raiffeisen Capital in Moscow, said by
phone. </p>
<p>The yield on Russia''s 2042 dollar notes dropped 11 basis
points today to 5.737 percent by 11:37 a.m. in Moscow. The extra
yield investors demand to hold Russia''s dollar debt rather than
Treasuries fell one basis point to 237, compared with a gain of
one basis point to 237 for Brazil, according to JPMorgan
indexes. </p>
<h2>Key Categories </h2>
<p>Goldman''s analysts compared Russia against countries rated
BBB on 11 macroeconomic, fiscal and structural criteria, which
Fitch uses in its sovereign credit rating model. Russia ranked
in the middle of the peer group based on all variables, and
above average for key categories the market is focusing on,
including external and fiscal balances, Grafe said. </p>
<p>This mispricing will disappear in the next few months,
he said. </p>

<p>Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) will
ask a judge to put to rest antitrust allegations that have
plagued the companies for years over fees that are paid by U.S.
merchants to support the credit card networks. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge John Gleeson in Brooklyn, New York,
will hear arguments today over whether to grant final approval
to a multibillion-dollar class-action settlement on behalf of
merchants nationwide. Opposed by scores of big-box retailers and
other consumer businesses, the accord is aimed at ending future
court battles with U.S. merchants over the practice of setting
credit card interchange payments, known as swipe fees. </p>
<p>They''re seeing this settlement as finally buying them
some peace, said Steven Semeraro, a former U.S. Justice
Department lawyer who isn''t involved in the case. And that''s
worth it to them, however many billions of dollars it''s going to
cost. </p>
<p>Developed by banks half a century ago, Visa and MasterCard
have been subject to government scrutiny over their business
practices for decades, Georgetown University law professor Adam Levitin wrote in a 2008 report on credit card merchant
restraints. The card firms faced an antitrust suit filed by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) and other retailers in 1996 and actions by the
Justice Department, leading to changes in some of their rules. </p>
<p>Bank-owned groups spun off the card companies through
initial public offerings in 2006 and 2008 in a move that
merchants alleged was intended to dodge antitrust liability. </p>
<h2>Previous Settlement </h2>
<p>Not long after Foster City, California-based Visa and
Purchase, New York-based MasterCard received final approval for
their previous settlement of more than $4 billion in January
2004, the current case was brought against them in October 2005. </p>
<p>The firms thought they would be protected from future
antitrust lawsuits over interchange fees by releases written
into the settlement of the earlier Wal-Mart-led case, said
Semeraro, a professor at the Thomas Jefferson School of Law in
San Diego. </p>
<p>This time, the card companies think they really have the
language in there and included an unbelievably broad
release, he said. </p>
<p>It prohibits virtually anyone except an antitrust
enforcement authority from ever suing them again for anything
that relates to antitrust claims, he said. </p>
<p>Estimated to be the largest ever in a U.S. antitrust case,
the settlement is currently valued at about $5.7 billion. In an
August report, a court-appointed expert said that plaintiffs
might have difficulty establishing that the companies violated
antitrust laws at trial and are probably better off with the
accord. </p>
<h2>Interchange Payments </h2>
<p>Merchants are expected to receive about one-third of a
year''s worth of interchange payments if final approval is
granted and the order isn''t delayed by an appeal. That estimate
is based on assumptions about the number of merchants that will
file claims and other factors. </p>
<p>Visa and MasterCard forged ahead with the settlement
despite objections from hundreds of retailers, including Wal-Mart and Target Corp. (TGT), which contended that the releases would
cover too many of the firms'' policies and allow them to raise
rates in the future. </p>
<p>In a conference call with investors this July, MasterCard
President and Chief Executive Officer Ajay Banga disclosed that
the companies decided not to back out of the accord even though
a termination provision had been triggered by the volume of
merchants that dropped out. Some of those merchants have chosen
to file their own lawsuits. </p>
<h2>Gigantic Nightmare'' </h2>
<p>The settlement will help the card companies rid themselves
of a gigantic nightmare in terms of legal fees and other
costs, said Sarah Jane Hughes, a professor at Indiana University
Bloomington''s Maurer School of Law, who isn''t involved in the
litigation. </p>
<p>MasterCard said it''s confident the court will grant final
approval. </p>
<p>The scope of the release is reasonable and logical,
Noah Hanft, the company''s general counsel, said in a phone
interview. </p>
<p>Paul Cohen, a Visa spokesman, declined to comment about
today''s hearing. </p>
<p>In a joint court filing in April, lawyers for the card
companies and major U.S. banks said the release covers only
claims based on continued rules and practices that are the same
as, or substantially similar to, those currently in place or
modified by the settlement, which courts have held a class may
properly release. </p>
<p>Interchange fees are collected by Visa and MasterCard and
turned over to banks, which use the funds to help cover the
costs of issuing cards. </p>
<p>The U.S. began regulating debit-card interchange fees under
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of
2010. In July, a federal judge found those fees had been set too
high and ordered the Federal Reserve to revisit the rates. </p>
<p>The case is In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant
Discount Antitrust Litigation, 05-md-01720, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), on pace to be the top adviser on U.S. initial public offerings for the first time since 2009, scored a coup by landing the lead role on Twitter Inc.''s sale. </p> <p>Twitter, which announced yesterday that it filed for an IPO, gave Goldman Sachs the job of running the sale, a person with knowledge of the matter said. JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Morgan Stanley (MS) will also be bankers for the IPO, said another person, who asked not to be identified because the process is private. Deutsche Bank AG also has a part, another person said. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs lost out to rival Morgan Stanley on similar roles in the highest-profile technology IPOs in recent years, including Facebook Inc. (FB)''s $16 billion sale last year and offerings by Groupon Inc. and Zynga Inc. the year before. San Francisco-based Twitter may have opted for Goldman Sachs after the other offerings drew criticism and complaints from shareholders, according to Michael Holland of Holland  Co. </p> <p>The Facebook experience was one that was so egregious that Twitter did a fairly predictable thing, said Holland, who oversees more than $4 billion as chairman of the New York-based money manager. When the biggest and best have needed IPO services, Goldman is always a finalist. </p>

<p>Julien Grout, a former JPMorgan (JPM)
Chase  Co. trader charged with trying to hide the bank''s record
trading loss last year, is arguing to prosecutors that he was
following orders from his then-boss, Bruno Iksil, people with
knowledge of the matter said. </p>
<p>Grout''s lawyers provided records including e-mails to U.S.
prosecutors in Manhattan in the past two weeks in an effort to
cast doubt on the government''s assertion that Iksil resisted
pressure to inflate the value of the trades, said the people,
who asked not to be named because the talks were private. While
Grout and another supervisor, Javier Martin-Artajo, were charged
with conspiracy and wire fraud, Iksil -- nicknamed the London
Whale -- avoided prosecution after agreeing to cooperate with
authorities. </p>
<p>The exchange shows that Grout, who is fighting accusations
he improperly marked assets to hide losses, is trying to damage
his former boss''s credibility. In announcing charges against
Grout and Martin-Artajo last month, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara
in Manhattan said Iksil had sounded the alarm more than once
to co-workers. </p>
<p>It may be part of an attempt to tell the government that
this case is weaker than you think, and you''ll be embarrassed,
John Coffee, a securities law professor at Columbia University
Law School, said of Grout''s effort. E-mails are often a matter
of debate, with defense attorneys trying to tell the
prosecution that they can''t go forward because their
interpretation is wrong. </p>

<p>Gold is poised to extend declines
as the U.S. Federal Reserve withdraws stimulus and economic data
improve, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which says that
there''s a risk that bullion may drop below $1,000 an ounce.
Futures retreated in New York. </p>
<p>While debt-ceiling discussions in the U.S. and the Syrian

its decline into next year, Jeffrey Currie, head of commodities
research, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television today.
The bank''s target for 2014 is $1,050, and the commodity may
overshoot to the downside, Currie said in Singapore. Gold
futures haven''t traded below $1,000 since October 2009. </p>
<p>Bullion has dropped 22 percent this year as some investors
lost faith in the metal as a store of value, the U.S. economy
improved and stocks and the dollar rallied. The Fed will pare
its $85 billion a month bond-buying program next week, according
to a Bloomberg survey. Earlier this year, Currie issued a sell
recommendation on bullion on April 10, before gold plunged 13
percent in a two-session slump that ended April 15. </p>
<p>While we agree with the mid-cycle price somewhere around
$1,200, we believe that at least near term it can overshoot to
the downside, which is why we have $1,050 as a target, Currie
said. It clearly could trade below $1,000. </p>
<h2>Record Price </h2>
<p>Gold for December delivery fell as much as 2 percent to
$1,304.60 on the Comex, the lowest since Aug. 9, and traded at
$1,314.40 at 11:52 a.m. in New York. Most-active futures reached
a record $1,923.70 in September 2011. Goldman''s three- and six-month targets are $1,300, according to a report on Sept. 11. </p>
<p>Global stocks tracked by the MSCI All-Country World Index
rallied 12 percent this year and the Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index
climbed 3.9 percent. The Fed began buying $40 billion of
mortgage-backed securities per month in September of last year
and then supplemented that with $45 billion of Treasury
securities in December to bolster the recovery. Fed Chairman Ben
S. Bernanke suggested on June 19 that the program might be wound
up by the middle of next year. </p>
<p>For next year, a move to $1,000 is on the cards, said
Dominic Schnider, head of commodities research at UBS AG''s
wealth-management unit in Singapore. Once a timetable of
tapering is known, then you probably will see a fresh selling
wave of the exchange-traded fund side. </p>
<p>Most of the Fed''s expected decision next week to start
tapering has been priced in, and Goldman expects an initial
reduction of $10 billion a month in asset purchases, said
Currie. A stronger dollar would diminish gold demand, he said. </p>
<h2>ETP Sales </h2>
<p>Investors have sold bullion at a record pace from exchange-traded products this year. Holdings in ETPs have contracted
684.1 metric tons to 1,947.8 tons after shrinking every month in
2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Credit Suisse Group AG raised the possibility of gold
trading below $1,000 in May as Ric Deverell, head of commodities
research at the bank, said then that bullion was going to get
crushed as inflation risks remained muted. That forecast was for
bullion in five years'' time. </p>
<p>The real key in gold is to see the evidence of the
improving economic data in the U.S., said Currie, who is based
in New York. Weakening emerging-market currencies, especially
the South African rand, will also help to reduce the cost of
production in dollars, he said </p>
<p>The Institute for Supply Management''s factory index showed
U.S. manufacturing expanded in August at the fastest pace since
June 2011. The group''s gauge of service industries, which cover
almost 90 percent of the economy, posted the highest reading
since December 2005, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Disaster Insurance </h2>
<p>Gold has fallen this year because investors see less need
for disaster insurance, Bernanke said in July. One reason that
prices are lower is that people are less concerned about extreme
outcomes, particularly negative, he said. </p>
<p>The U.S. federal government needs to increase its debt
limit later this year, and Goldman expects that the ceiling will
be raised by the end of next month, according to the Sept. 11
report. On Syria, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met with
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov this week to seek to get
Syria to give up its chemical weapons. </p>

<p>General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP), the
second-largest U.S. shopping mall owner, said it spent $567
million repurchasing shares, mostly from Bill Ackman''s Pershing
Square Capital Management LP. </p>
<p>The real estate investment trust''s board has approved the
repurchase of 28.3 million shares at an average price of $20 a
share in the third quarter through yesterday, according to a
statement today. General Growth, based in Chicago, said it
bought 25 million shares at $20 a share from Pershing yesterday. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Sandeep Mathrani said the shares
are being bought at a capitalization rate of about 6 percent.
This is a discount to private-market valuation for high-quality U.S. retail properties, he said in the statement. </p>
<p>Pershing was the second-largest investor in General Growth,
holding about 68 million shares as of June 30, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The New York-based hedge-fund firm
previously sold about 7 million shares of the mall landlord in
June, the data show. General Growth''s shares fell 1.1 percent to
$19.36 yesterday and have dropped 2.5 percent this year. </p>
<p>Mall REITs, which enjoyed strong tenant sales growth since
the credit crisis and recession, now face sluggish retail sales
and limited opportunities to expand. This has pushed investors
to look elsewhere for earnings growth. </p>
<h2>Share Performance </h2>
<p>The Bloomberg mall REIT index has fallen 5.4 percent this
year, the worst performing part of the industry, after posting
the biggest increases from the start of 2009 through 2012. REITs
that own regional malls reported the smallest increase in tenant
sales per square foot in three years in the second quarter,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>General Growth''s purchases reduced the REIT''s total shares
outstanding to about 964 million, according to the statement.
The company paid for the transaction in cash. </p>
<p>Ackman, founder of Pershing, helped rescue General Growth
from near-collapse by pushing it to file for bankruptcy in 2009,
when he also won a board seat. The effort turned $60 million
into $1.6 billion, Ackman told Bloomberg News in 2011, and
contributed to his flagship fund''s net return of 29 percent in
2010. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its
outlook for U.S. soybean prices in the next three and six months
after a government report yesterday showed U.S. production will
be reduced due to dry weather. </p>
<p>Soybeans may be $12.50 a bushel in three months and $11.50
in six months, below current price levels while above the bank''s
previous outlook of $10.50 a bushel, Goldman analysts including
Damien Courvalin wrote in an e-mailed report today. The U.S.
Department of Agriculture lowered its forecast for the U.S.
harvest to 3.149 billion bushels yesterday, its second cut in as
many months and 3.3 percent less than expected in August. </p>
<p>Uncertainty over the size of the U.S. corn and especially
soybean crops remain unusually high for this time of year given
the volatility and extremes in planting and growing weather
across the Midwest, Courvalin wrote. The USDA may lower its
outlook for U.S. yields again in its October report, he said. </p>
<p>Soybeans for November delivery rallied 2.8 percent
yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade, before falling as much
as 0.7 percent today to $13.8675 a bushel. The most-active
contract has jumped 20 percent since reaching a 19-month low in
August as heat and dry weather intensified in U.S. growing
areas. </p>
<p>Areas of the Midwest, including top growers Iowa and
Illinois, had as little as 5 percent of the normal amount of
rain in the last 30 days, according to the National Weather
Service. Crop development was already delayed by wet, cool
weather earlier this year, leaving yields vulnerable to heat and
dry weather in August, a time when plants are developing pods
and maturing before the harvest, USDA data show. </p>
<h2>Production </h2>
<p>Soybean prices may still be pressured by ample world
supplies, Courvalin said. Global production may be 281.66
million metric tons, less than expected in August while still
the biggest crop on record, the USDA estimated. </p>
<p>While we see upside risk to current prices given downside
risks to U.S. production, we ultimately believe that lower U.S.
exports and another large increase in South American soybean
acreage and production will leave U.S. inventories above last
year''s level and prices below the current forward curve,
Courvalin said. </p>
<p>Corn prices may be $4.25 a bushel in the next three, six
and 12 months, Courvalin said. The bank left its wheat forecast
unchanged at $6.50 a bushel. </p>

<p>South Korean stocks are beating
bonds by the most in six quarters as foreign investors buy
shares at the fastest pace on record and accelerating global
economic growth increases the chances of monetary tightening. </p>
<p>The Kospi (KOSPI) index has added 7 percent since the end of June,
compared with a gain of less than 0.1 percent in Bank of America
Corp.''s index tracking the nation''s sovereign debt, the biggest
gap since the first quarter of 2012. While overseas money
managers withdrew $1.9 billion from debt in August, equities
lured inflows in the past five weeks, including a record $3.6
billion last week. The Kospi is valued at 1.1 times net assets,
a 47 percent discount versus the MSCI All-Country World Index. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Asset Management and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. say
shares will keep outperforming bonds as the fastest export
growth in seven months boosts profit at Kospi companies, which
get about 40 percent of their sales overseas. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg predict the Federal Reserve will announce
a reduction in its bond-purchase program on Sept. 18, while
Goldman Sachs says the Bank of Korea will increase interest
rates in the second half of 2014. </p>
<p>We bought more Korean stocks in August, Grace Tam, a
Hong Kong-based global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset,
which manages about $1.5 trillion, said in a telephone interview
on Sept. 11. Rotation from bonds to equities will go on. </p>
<p>International investors have poured a net $7.2 billion into
South Korean shares in the past five weeks as data showed the
economy expanded 1.1 percent in the three months through June
from the previous quarter, while exports jumped at a quicker-than-estimated 7.7 percent rate in August. Foreigners bought a
net $165.4 million worth of Kospi shares as of 10:37 a.m. in
Seoul today, extending net purchases to 17 consecutive days. The
benchmark Kospi index added 0.9 percent to 2011.96. </p>
<h2>Samsung Inflows </h2>
<p>Samsung Electronics Co. (005930), the world''s biggest smartphone
maker, attracted $2.05 billion of inflows during the period and
SK Hynix Inc. (000660), the second-largest computer-memory chipmaker,
lured $573 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The Kospi advanced 2 percent last week to 1,994.32,
extending its rally from an 11-month low on June 25 to 12
percent. The Bank of America bond index returned 0.8 percent
last week and its yield slipped to 3.19 percent, within 0.01
percentage point of the lowest level since July 24. The won
strengthened 0.6 percent to 1,086.88 per dollar, paring this
year''s drop to 2.1 percent. The cost of protecting the nation''s
debt against nonpayment using credit default swaps rose to 75
basis points from 73.5, according to CMA. </p>
<h2>Profit Growth </h2>
<p>The benchmark equity index will probably climb to as high
as 2,200 by the middle of next year, a 10 percent gain from its
closing level on Sept. 13, according to Kwon Goohoon, a Seoul-based economist for Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization at Kospi index companies will probably climb 15
percent in the next 12 months, versus 10 percent for the MSCI
All-Country index, according analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Corporate earnings will see better growth, most likely
from the fourth quarter, as global economies including Korea are
turning around, Kwon said in a phone interview. </p>
<p>Reduced stimulus by the Fed will weigh on most emerging-market assets, including South Korean equities, Vivek Misra, a
Bangalore-based Asia equity strategist at Societe Generale SA,
said in a telephone interview on Sept. 13. The Kospi may end the
year at 1,900, about 5 percent below the closing level last
week, before rallying in 2014, Misra said. </p>
<h2>Fed Taper </h2>
<p>The U.S. central bank will cut monthly Treasury purchases
to $35 billion from $45 billion while maintaining mortgage-bond
buying at $40 billion, according to the median of 34 responses
in a Bloomberg News survey of economists on Sept. 6. That pace
was unchanged from an Aug. 9-13 poll, as was a projection that
the program will end in June. The Kospi has rallied 106 percent
since the Fed''s first round of bond-buying in 2008. </p>
<p>The gains in South Korean stocks this quarter have reduced
dividend yields on the Kospi to the lowest levels since April
2012 compared with the yield on debt, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The equity gauge has a payout of 1.17 percent,
versus the 3.57 percent yield on the nation''s 10-year government
bonds. The gap of 2.4 percent compares with the 16-month low of
2.5 percent on Aug. 19. </p>
<p>Investors will continue favoring equities over bonds as
interest rates rise, said Kim Jiun, a Seoul-based analyst at
Shinhan Investment Corp. The foreign withdrawals from debt in
August were the first in seven months, according to the
Financial Supervisory Service. </p>
<h2>BlackRock Outlook </h2>
<p>While the Bank of Korea held its key interest rate at 2.5
percent for a fourth straight month last week, Goldman Sachs
estimates the central bank will increase the rate to 3 percent
by the end of 2014. The economy will expand 2.8 percent in 2013
and 4 percent next year, which would be the fastest pace since
2010, according to central bank forecasts. </p>
<p>We have been holding a conservative view on the bond
market and have moved to bonds with shorter maturity, Kim Ki
Hyun, head of the fixed-income investment division at Woori
Asset Management Co., said by phone from Seoul. </p>
<p>Quicker global growth is boosting the sales outlook for
South Korean companies, according to BlackRock Inc., the world''s
largest money manager. Service industries in the U.S. expanded
in August at the fastest pace in almost eight years as a pickup
in demand encouraged companies to increase hiring, the Institute
for Supply Management said on Sept. 5. </p>
<p>Korean exporters are benefiting from global growth,
Marc Desmidt, the head of alpha strategies for Asia Pacific at
BlackRock, which oversees about $3.8 trillion, said in a Sept.
11 interview on Bloomberg Television. If that continues that
will be very good for them. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank, said internal stress tests show the company would
come through an economic crisis with more than enough capital to
stay in business. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s Tier 1 common ratio would be at least 8.5
percent in a scenario designed to measure how the firm would
perform during a severe crunch, the New York-based bank said
today in a presentation on its website. </p>
<p>The bank would show a net loss before taxes of $0.3 billion
from the second quarter of 2013 through the middle of 2015, with
$32.1 billion in loan losses and $17.5 billion in trading and
counterparty losses. </p>
<p>The biggest U.S. banks must run their own tests on how they
would fare during a crisis to supplement those conducted by the
Federal Reserve six months earlier. The central bank reports
results each March based on different economic assumptions. The
most recent round showed 17 of the 18 largest firms surviving a
deep recession. </p>
<p>JPMorgan said it would have been more conservative in its
assumptions if it had been able to incorporate feedback from the
Federal Reserve before running the results in late March. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp., Wells
Fargo  Co. and Citigroup Inc. also concluded their firms would
ride out a shock. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs said it could handle a crisis that sends
stocks down 40 percent and produces $20 billion in trading
losses for the firm. Bank of America, ranked second by assets
among U.S. lenders, foresaw a $26.1 billion cumulative deficit.
Citigroup, ranked third by assets, found it would exceed capital
minimums even after sustaining about $43 billion in loan losses
and $10 billion in trading and counterparty losses. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs and Citigroup are based in New York. Bank of
America has its headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s stock advanced 1.1 percent today to $53.14,
bringing the gain for this year to 21 percent. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) said internal stress
tests show the firm can weather a severe economic crisis with a

<p>Morgan Stanley would maintain a Tier 1 common capital ratio
of at least 9.5 percent during a hypothetical shock scenario,
above the 5 percent minimum, the New York-based firm said in a
summary of its company-run test. It assumed the Standard 
Poor''s 500 Index would drop 41 percent while the U.S. and euro-zone economies shrink 5 percent within the first year. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said it
could survive a global market shock that would send stocks down
almost 40 percent and produce $20 billion in trading losses for
the firm. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs would maintain a Tier 1 common ratio of at
least 8.9 percent during the shock, above the 5 percent minimum,
the New York-based firm said in a disclosure of its company-run
stress test. The test included the assumption of a
reputational event specific to Goldman Sachs that would
reduce its revenue over the nine-quarter length of the exam. </p>
<p>The biggest U.S. banks must conduct so-called mid-cycle
stress tests using their own scenarios and disclose a summary of

that in the Federal Reserve''s version in March, in which it had
a minimum Tier 1 common ratio of 5.8 percent. The Fed''s test had
different assumptions and covered a different time period. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs projected it would have a $6.2 billion net

severely adverse scenario. The bank would have $15.5 billion
of pre-provision net revenue in the period, overwhelmed by $20

<p>Scotland approved a Morgan Stanley-backed venture that will use turbines to harness the power of
tides to generate electricity in the region''s waters. </p>
<p>MeyGen Ltd., owned by Morgan Stanley (MS), Atlantis Resources
Corp. and International Power Ltd., a GDF Suez (GSZ) SA unit, won
consent to install tidal turbines in stages, starting with a 9-megawatt demonstration project, the Scottish government said
today in a statement on its website. The project, in the
Pentland Firth off the coast of northern Scotland, may
eventually reach 398 megawatts. </p>
<p>The development will be the largest tidal turbine array
in Europe and the first commercial project off these shores,
Scottish Energy Minister Fergus Ewing said in the statement.
When fully operational, the 86-megawatt array could generate
enough electricity to power the equivalent of 42,000 homes --
around 40 percent of homes in the highlands. </p>
<p>Scotland, aiming for all of its electricity to come from
clean sources by 2020, may have as much as a quarter of Europe''s
tidal resources, according to government estimates. It offers
one of the highest subsidies in the world for marine energy. </p>
<p>The Scottish government also said today that the wave
energy technology companies Aquamarine Power Ltd. and Pelamis
Wave Power Ltd. will share 13 million pounds ($21 million). The
money comes from funds the government set aside to support the

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world''s
largest software maker, announced a new $40 billion stock
buyback plan and increased its dividend 22 percent, seeking to
reward shareholders as the company undergoes a change in
strategy and leadership. </p>
<p>The repurchase program, which has no expiration date,
replaces another $40 billion buyback plan that was due to lapse
at the end of this month, Microsoft said today in a statement.
The company''s quarterly dividend will rise to 28 cents a share,
payable on Dec. 12 to shareholders of record as of Nov. 21. </p>
<p>The move is a step in the right direction for investors,
though the open-ended schedule for the new buyback plan raises
questions, said Matthew Hedberg, an analyst with RBC Capital
Markets in Minneapolis. The company has come under pressure from
activist investor ValueAct Holdings LP, which pushed Microsoft
to return more money to shareholders, according to a person with
knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>What would be more interesting is if they put more
parameters on the timing of the buyback -- sooner is better than
later, said Hedberg, who has a neutral rating on Microsoft.
The dividend is more material because it''s incremental to
their existing dividend. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said it
could survive a global market shock that would send stocks down
almost 40 percent and produce $20 billion in trading losses for
the firm. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs would maintain a Tier 1 common ratio of at
least 8.9 percent during the shock, above the 5 percent minimum,
the New York-based firm said in a disclosure of its company-run
stress test. The test included the assumption of a
reputational event specific to Goldman Sachs that would
reduce its revenue over the nine-quarter length of the exam. </p>
<p>The biggest U.S. banks, including JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and
Bank of America Corp., must conduct so-called mid-cycle stress
tests using their own scenarios and disclose a summary of the
results. </p>
<p>Goldman Sach''s performance in its own test topped that in
the Federal Reserve''s version in March, in which it had a
minimum Tier 1 common ratio of 5.8 percent. The Fed''s test had
different assumptions and covered a different time period. </p>
<p>The firm projected it would have a $6.2 billion net loss
over the nine quarters from April 2013 to June 2015 in a
severely adverse scenario. It would have $15.5 billion of
pre-provision net revenue in the period, overwhelmed by $20
billion in trading and counterparty losses, $1.1 billion in
other losses and a $600 million provision for loan losses. </p>
<p>Separately, Citigroup Inc. (C), the third-largest U.S. bank by
assets, could incur $21.2 billion of losses over nine quarters
through mid-2015 and stay above minimum regulatory capital
levels in a severe financial downturn. </p>
<p>The bank''s Tier 1 common capital ratio would fall to as low
as 9.1 percent under a severely adverse scenario, above the 5
percent minimum set by U.S. regulators, the New York-based
company said yesterday in a presentation on its website. </p>
<p>Citigroup''s figures assume $43.1 billion in pre-provision
net revenue and an equal amount of loan losses in the nine
quarters from the end of March 2013 through June 2015. </p>
<p>Separately, Bank of America saw Tier 1 capital ratio under
its stress test at June 30, 2015, at 10.6 percent, according to
a statement posted on its website. </p>
<h2>Compliance Policy </h2>
<h2>Bundesbank Says ECB Bank Oversight May Need Primary-Law Change </h2>
<p>European Union lawmakers will probably have to amend the
rules governing the European Central Bank as it embarks on the
complex task of regulating banks, according to the Bundesbank. </p>
<p>Sabine Lautenschlaeger, vice president of the German
central bank, said in Frankfurt yesterday that a primary law
change may be needed to simplify the governance structure and
separate monetary policy more clearly from banking
supervision. </p>
<p>The ECB is set to oversee banks, starting next year, as
part of an effort to create a banking union that would break the
link between lenders and states, which spawned the sovereign
debt crisis. Critics say the move may create a conflict of
interest at the central bank as policy makers are charged with
guaranteeing the stability of Europe''s financial sector while
fighting inflation. </p>
<p>The Bundesbank vice president said her concerns don''t mean
she favors delaying plans for more concerted controls of
European lenders. </p>
<h2>Kenyan Bourse Authority Completes Draft Rules for Futures Trade </h2>
<p>Draft regulations, aimed at creating a fair and efficient
futures exchange, are open for public comment until Oct. 17, the

said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>The development of the two draft regulations bring to
completion the requisite regulatory framework for the
establishment of a futures market in Kenya, the authority said
in the statement. </p>
<p>Plans to set-up a futures market in Kenya have been delayed

<h2>Compliance Action </h2>
<h2>U.K. to Sell $5.3 Billion Lloyds Stake, Five Years After Bailout </h2>
<p>The U.K. government plans to sell a 3.3 billion-pound ($5.3
billion) stake in Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY), its first disposal
since bailing out the lender in 2008. </p>
<p>U.K. Financial Investments Ltd., which oversees the
government''s holding in the bank, is selling 4.28 billion shares
to money managers, the London-based body said in a statement
yesterday. </p>
<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, constrained by
the biggest austerity program since World War II, could use the
proceeds to fund tax cuts or more spending before the next
general election, due in 2015. He has said Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc, which received a 45.5 billion-pound bailout,
is still burdened by too many poor assets to be sold. </p>
<p>The transaction will reduce the Treasury''s stake in Lloyds
to 32.7 percent from 38.7 percent. JPMorgan Chase  Co., Bank of
America Corp. and UBS AG are managing the offering, according to
a statement from UKFI. The government still owns 81 percent of
Edinburgh-based RBS. </p>
<p>The Lloyds sale is the government''s biggest since the
financial crisis. </p>

<h2>HSBC Joins Morgan Stanley in Plan to Screen for Money Laundering </h2>
<p>HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) and Morgan Stanley (MS) are working with
outside firms to develop a shared client-screening service amid
a crackdown by regulators on money laundering. </p>
<p>Genpact Ltd. (G) and Markit Group Ltd. are creating the
service, which will help banks satisfy so-called know-your-client requirements, Hamilton, Bermuda-based Genpact said
yesterday in a statement. The service will allow banks to start
new trading relationships faster and cut costs by sharing
expenses, according to the statement. </p>
<p>The U.S. fined London-based HSBC $1.9 billion last year
over claims the lender gave terrorists and drug cartels access
to the U.S. financial system. Europe''s biggest bank was accused
of failing to monitor more than $670 billion in wire transfers
and more than $9.4 billion in purchases of U.S. currency from
HSBC Mexico, prosecutors said. </p>
<p>HSBC accepted responsibility at the time and said it''s a
fundamentally different organization from the one that made
those mistakes. </p>
<p>New York-based Morgan Stanley, owner of the world''s largest
brokerage, hasn''t faced fines over money laundering since the
financial crisis. </p>
<p>Regulators have ordered U.S. banks including Citigroup Inc.

<h2>Courts </h2>
<h2>Ex-JPMorgan Employees Indicted Over $6.2 Billion Derivative Loss </h2>
<p>Two former JPMorgan Chase  Co. traders were indicted for
engaging in a securities fraud to hide trading losses that
eventually surpassed $6.2 billion on wrong-way derivatives bets
last year. </p>
<p>Javier Martin-Artajo, who oversaw trading strategy for the
synthetic portfolio at the bank''s chief investment office in
London, and Julien Grout, a trader who worked for him, were
named in a federal indictment, which was unsealed yesterday in
federal court in Manhattan. The U.S. announced preliminary
charges against the men in August. </p>
<p>Both were charged in yesterday''s indictment with five
criminal counts, including securities fraud, conspiracy, filing
false books and records, wire fraud and making false filings
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The pair,
along with unnamed co-conspirators, are accused of engaging in a
scheme to manipulate and inflate the value of position markings
in the synthetic credit portfolio, or SCP. </p>
<p>Martin-Artajo and Grout were named in criminal complaints
filed by prosecutors in the office of Manhattan U.S. Attorney
Preet Bharara on Aug. 14 that accused them of four separate
counts of conspiracy, falsifying books and records, wire fraud,
and false filings with the SEC. Yesterday''s indictment, which
formalized those counts, added the securities fraud charge,
which carries a maximum term of 20 years in prison. </p>
<p>JPMorgan has agreed to pay at least $750 million to resolve
U.S. and U.K. regulatory probes of its record trading loss,
people with knowledge of the negotiations said. The bank is
seeking to settle as many inquiries as possible before the third
quarter ends Sept. 30, the people said, asking not to be
identified because the talks are private. </p>
<p>Ed Little, a lawyer for Grout, and Meeta Vadher, a
spokeswoman for Martin-Artajo''s lawyers, didn''t immediately
return e-mails yesterday after regular business hours seeking
comment on the indictment. Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for New
York-based JPMorgan, declined to comment on the charges against
the two men. </p>

from the securities industry and an admission of wrongdoing was
accepted by a federal judge. </p>
<p>The SEC accused Falcone, who became a billionaire by
betting against the U.S. housing market in 2006, of improperly
borrowing money from his fund to pay his personal taxes and said
he gave preferential treatment to some of his investors in
returning their money. </p>
<p>The bar from the securities industry will allow Falcone to
liquidate his hedge funds under SEC supervision. He and his firm

<h2>Repsol, Cepsa Lose Bid for Reduction in EU Bitumen-Cartel Fines </h2>
<p>Repsol SA and Cia. Espanola de Petroleos SA lost European
Union court appeals against fines levied for fixing prices of
bitumen in Spain, while Nynas AB and Galp Energia SGPS SA had
their penalties cut. </p>
<p>The EU General Court yesterday rejected appeals by Repsol
and Cepsa of the six-year-old fines. The Luxembourg-based EU
court trimmed the fines for Galp and a Spanish unit to 8.3
million euros ($11.1 million) from 8.6 million euros and reduced
a penalty for Nynas to 10.4 million euros from 10.6 million
euros. </p>
<p>Repsol, which previously was called Repsol YPF SA, was
fined 80.5 million euros. Madrid-based Cepsa was fined 83.8
million euros. BP Plc, Europe''s second-largest oil company, got
immunity from any fines for being the first to come forward with
information about the cartel. </p>
<p>Bitumen is used primarily for surfacing roads and
waterproofing. More than 10,000 European companies make or lay
asphalt. </p>
<p>Galp is certain that a complete annulment of the decision
is justified, the Lisbon, Portugal-based company said in a
statement on the securities regulator''s website. The company
said it will study the ruling before deciding whether to appeal. </p>
<p>Kristian Rix, a spokesman for Repsol, said the company
didn''t immediately have any comment, when contacted by phone. No
one in the press departments of Nynas or Cepsa was immediately
available for comment when contacted by phone. </p>
<p>Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for the commission, said it
welcomed the court ruling as it confirms all the substantial
findings of the authority. </p>
<p>The cases are: T-462/07, T-482/07, T-495/07, T-496/07,
T-497/07. </p>
<h2>RBS Said to Settle Highland Suits Over $100 Million CDO Losses </h2>
<p>Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc settled lawsuits with
Highland Capital Management LP over a failed debt deal that led
to accusations of fraud and dishonesty, and losses of as much as
$100 million, a person familiar with the cases said. </p>
<p>The settlement ends a four-year legal battle with lawsuits
in London and Texas between RBS and Dallas-based Highland. The
terms are confidential, according to the person, who asked not
to be identified because they weren''t authorized to discuss it. </p>
<p>Highland said it lost as much as $100 million when RBS
terminated a planned 500 million-euro ($668 million)
collateralized-debt obligation at the height of the 2008
financial crisis and then seized the underlying loans. </p>
<p>The Edinburgh-based lender is being sued by as many as
16,000 investors over a 2008 share offering before its collapse
in the 2008 financial crisis, as well as other claims from
customers. </p>
<p>Stefan Prelog, a spokesman for Highland in New York,
declined to comment on the settlement. A spokeswoman for RBS in
London declined to comment. </p>

Division) A3/2012/1474. </p>
<h2>Wabco Wins $272 Million Cut in EU Cartel Fine for Ideal Standard </h2>
<p>Wabco Holdings Inc. (WBC) won a 203.4 million euro ($272 million)
windfall after a European Union court cut the antitrust penalty
it paid for Ideal Standard''s involvement in a bathroom fittings
cartel. </p>
<p>The EU General Court in Luxembourg also trimmed Sanitec
Corp.''s fine to 50.6 million euros from 57.7 million euros.
Wabco was liable for the original fine as part of an accord
linked to its spinoff from American Standard Cos. that predated
the EU penalties. </p>
<p>The court said yesterday that EU regulators had wrongly
held Ideal Standard guilty of colluding on the Italian market
for ceramics for longer than was the case. </p>
<p>Wabco paid all of the 326.1 million-euros fine levied in
September 2010 and will keep the full amount of the
reimbursement awarded by the EU court yesterday, the company
said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. </p>
<p>Sanitec, owned by EQT Partners AB, said in a statement it
had made a provisional payment of 57.69 million euros in
September 2010. It now expects to be reimbursed the difference
plus interest. </p>
<p>Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for the commission in
Brussels, said the ruling confirms the substantial findings
of the regulator. </p>
<p>The cases are: T-412/10, T-411/10, T-408/10, T-396/10,
T-386/10, T-380/10, T-379/10, T-381/10, T-378/10, T-376/10,

<h2>BT Loses Court Fight Over EU Order to Repay U.K. Pension Aid </h2>
<p>BT Group Plc, the U.K.''s largest fixed-line phone company,
and its pension fund lost a court fight against a European Union
order forcing repayment of as much as 16.6 million pounds ($26.5
million) of exemptions from pension rules. </p>
<p>The EU General Court in Luxembourg yesterday rejected the
appeals by BT and BT Pension Scheme Trustees against the
findings of a European probe that the company benefited from
unlawful government aid which had to be recovered. </p>
<p>The European Commission, the 28-nation EU''s antitrust
regulator, concluded in 2009 that an exemption for the BT
Pension Scheme to contribute to the country''s Pension Protection
Fund was unlawful state aid. The EU probe was started after one
of BT''s competitors complained to the Brussels-based regulator. </p>
<p>The U.K. Pension Protection Fund was created in 2004 to
guarantee pensions when sponsor companies go bankrupt and was
financed by their contributions. BT''s exemption was created
under a so-called crown guarantee at the time of its
privatization in 1984 to protect the staff''s pensions. </p>
<p>We are disappointed with the decision, which is not in
the best interests of BT Pension Scheme members, Dan Thomas, a
spokesman for the company, said in an e-mailed statement. We
shall analyze the judgment in detail and decide upon next
steps. </p>
<p>The commission''s adverse decision had already been
implementedthrough changes to U.K.pensionlegislationprior to
the General Court''s decision as required by EU law, Thomas
said. The court''s decision maintains this status quo. </p>
<p>The amount to be recovered should be such as to eliminate
the economic advantage given to BT which, the EU decision
said, is the beneficiary of the measure. </p>
<p>The cases are: T-226/09, British Telecommunications v.
Commission, T-230/09, BT Pension Scheme Trustees v. Commission. </p>

<p>Investors expect German Chancellor
Angela Merkel to retain power in an election and they will

<p>There''s a clear expectation that Merkel will be involved
in the government in one form or another, Philip Holzer,
deputy head of Goldman Sachs in Germany, told reporters in
Frankfurt today. Merkel''s performance in the crisis was
received very positively internationally. The Americans are
increasingly constructive on Europe and the periphery. </p>
<p>Merkel''s Christian Democrats, who lead Germany''s largest
opposition party in polls ahead of the election this weekend,
have made fiscal austerity a condition of rescues of indebted
states amid efforts to preserve the euro. The European Central
Bank has also shored up confidence in the euro area by pledging
to buy sovereign bonds if states sign up to conditions. </p>
<p>There was a certain standstill before the election,
Hendrik Riehmer, managing partner of Hamburg-based Berenberg,
Germany''s oldest private bank, said at the joint briefing. The
expectation is that the European process will improve,

<p>Global investors and strategists
say India needs to remove all limits on investing in its bond
market, after a move to cut red tape helped bolster the rupee. </p>
<p>Lombard Odier Investment Management and Aletti Gestielle
Sgr SpA say such opening would allow India to join major bond
indexes, boosting inflows. Inclusion in JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s
GBI-Global Diversified Index of emerging-market government debt
could lure as much as $40 billion over 12 months, according to
Standard Chartered Plc. </p>
<p>The rupee rose 1 percent yesterday as Prime Minister
Manmohan Singh allowed foreigners to buy sovereign debt without
quotas until holdings reach 90 percent of the overall $30
billion limit. The currency slumped 14 percent as investors
pulled $8.9 billion from local notes in three months through
Aug. 31. Standard Chartered says inclusion in major indexes
would limit outflows during such panic selling as investors
can''t stray too far from their benchmark''s performance. </p>
<p>Removing the cap on debt investment is a progressive step
which policy makers should consider, said Nagaraj Kulkarni, a
strategist at Standard Chartered in Singapore. The latest
measure is a welcome simplification of an existing process. This
alone will be insufficient to reverse the recent outflows. </p>
<p>The rule change announced by Securities and Exchange Board
of India after trading hours on Sept. 13 follows an earlier
decision to remove the need for foreign institutional investors
to buy quotas for acquiring corporate debt. </p>
<h2>Investment Limit </h2>
<p>Regular overseas investors can buy as much as $25 billion
of government bonds and an extra investment of a maximum $5
billion is permitted for long-term investors such as sovereign
wealth funds. Both categories of foreigners held a combined 659
billion rupees ($10.4 billion) of debt as of Sept. 16, official
data show. Overseas funds held $138.5 billion of equities as of
Sept. 13, according to exchange data. </p>
<p>Foreign investors own about 2 percent of India''s $550
billion of rupee-denominated sovereign debt compared with 41
percent in Malaysia and 31 percent each in Indonesia and Brazil,
Standard Chartered estimated in a Sept. 12 research note.
Romania''s inclusion in JPMorgan GBI-EM index in March was
estimated to boost inflows by $2 billion, while the addition of
Nigerian debt in October last year was seen to lure $1.5 billion
to the country, according analysts at the U.S. bank. </p>
<p>Darrell Wright, head of communications and media relations
at JPMorgan in Singapore, said the lender couldn''t immediately
comment on India''s case. </p>
<h2>Portfolio Inflows </h2>
<p>We would expect portfolio inflows to pick up as India
joins global indices, said Holger Friedrich, who manages $490
million of bonds in London at Lombard Odier Investment
Manangement. It would be helpful in the long run, if combined
with reasonable macro long-term measures addressing structural
weaknesses, not just short-term steps to fix the currency
weakness. </p>
<p>The unit of Lombard Odier  Cie., a Geneva-based private
bank that managed $183 billion globally as of June, has a quota
to buy Indian government debt, Friedrich said in a Sept. 13
telephone interview. The notes have a 7 percent weight in its
in-house index for local-currency debt, he said. </p>
<p>The yield on India''s 7.16 percent rupee-denominated bond
due May 2023 fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point,
to 8.395 percent as of 2:08 p.m. in Mumbai, according to central
bank prices. It reached a five-year high of 9.24 percent on Aug.
19. The rupee fell 0.4 percent to 63.11 per dollar. </p>
<p>The cost of insuring bonds of State Bank of India (SBIN),
considered a proxy for the government by some investors, against
non-payment for five years fell 5 basis points yesterday to 326,
a sixth day of decline, according to data provider CMA. The
credit-default swaps surged 106 basis points in August, the most
since October 2008, and reached a 14-month high of 372 on Aug.
20. </p>
<h2>Twin Deficits </h2>
<p>India''s currency and bonds have declined this year as
Asia''s third-largest economy expanded 4.4 percent last quarter
from a year earlier, the least since the three months ended
March 2009, and amid the nation''s twin current-account and
budget deficits. Foreign investors pulled $3.7 billion from
stocks in the three months through Aug. 31 as capital fled
emerging markets amid prospects of the Federal Reserve reducing
its record stimulus. </p>
<p>The shortfall in the current account, the broadest measure
of trade, widened to a record 4.8 percent of GDP in the year
ended March 31, official data show. The Reserve Bank of India
considers the gap the biggest risk to India''s economy. </p>
<p>In January 2012, then RBI Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said
that though limits for foreign investment in corporate and
government debt have been expanded marginally, the changes were
only meant to gauge market appetite and were not a sign that
caps will be increased further. The central bank prefers non-debt flows over debt flows, he said. </p>
<h2>Yield Swings </h2>
<p>The perception that higher bond inflows would stoke market
volatility isn''t entirely true, Standard Chartered''s Kulkarni
said. Data compiled by the U.K. lender show yield swings in the
past three years have been larger in India than in markets like
South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand that have embraced larger
inflows, he said. </p>
<p>To be eligible for inclusion in global bond indexes India
shouldn''t have explicit capital controls, must allow its
currency to be freely traded and encourage foreign
participation, Standard Chartered said in its report, citing
criteria for benchmarks compiled by banks including JPMorgan. </p>
<p>India will see committed long-term flows if some of the
caps are eased, and that will benefit its economy and investor
community, Walter Rossini, who oversees $200 million of Indian
assets at Aletti Gestielle in Milan, said in a Sept. 12
telephone interview. It will lift confidence by more than just
a notch. </p>

<p>Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) isn''t the only Web

is unveiling today a revamped website with a redesigned logo. </p>
<p>The brand features a simpler typeface created to be
simple, real and direct that better matches the font used on
other Microsoft products, Scott Erickson, senior director, brand
and creative at Microsoft, wrote in a blog post. The company
also changed how it displays search results, moving from three
columns to two. </p>
<p>Microsoft has been rolling out changes to Bing about twice
a year and last unveiled a new design in May 2012, seeking to
attract more search users and narrow the gap with Google Inc. (GOOG)
The No. 1 software maker is undergoing a management transition
and struggling to break into mobile devices as users shift away
from personal computers, while keeping up investment in Web
services. </p>
<p>Microsoft had 17.9 percent of the search market in August,
up one percentage point from March, according to ComScore Inc. (SCOR)
Google leads with a 66.9 percent share, while Yahoo trails both
at 11.4 percent. </p>
<p>Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, said in July that
its online-services business, largely advertising revenue from
Bing and other online properties, posted an operating loss of
$1.28 billion in the fiscal year ended June 30. </p>

<p>Essent Group Ltd., the mortgage
insurer backed by investors including Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
and George Soros, filed for an initial public offering as
investors pour capital into companies that guaranty home loans. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Barclays Plc are
managing the share sale, Bermuda-based Essent said yesterday in
a regulatory filing. The proposed $287.5 million offering size
is a placeholder amount used to calculate registration fees and
may change. The prospectus didn''t include information about the
insurer''s implied valuation. </p>
<p>Mortgage insurers have rallied this year as the U.S.
residential real estate market rebounds and the government
weighs scaling back its role in housing finance. MGIC Investment
Corp. (MTG) and Radian Group Inc. sold stock and notes this year to
rebuild capital. Losses had mounted at the companies as
homeowners defaulted during the housing slump, triggering
payouts on policies sold prior to the crash. </p>
<p>Essent was created to serve the U.S. housing finance
industry at a time when the demands of the financial crisis and
a rapidly changing business environment created the need for a
new, privately funded mortgage insurance company, the firm
said in the filing. Its mortgage guarantee unit was formed in
late 2008. </p>
<p>The following year, Essent agreed to pay as much as $30
million for software and other assets from Triad Guaranty Inc.,
a mortgage insurer hobbled by losses from soured home loans.
Competitor PMI Group Inc. ceased writing new coverage and filed
for bankruptcy in 2011. </p>
<h2>Essent''s Expansion </h2>
<p>As those companies stopped writing new business, Essent
expanded. The firm accounted for 9.2 percent of coverage sales
in the first six months of this year, up from 5.2 percent a year
earlier, according to data compiled by Inside Mortgage Finance. </p>
<p>The insurer posted net income of $30.8 million in the six
months ended June 30, compared with a net loss of $12.5 million
a year earlier, according to the filing. Premium revenue more
than tripled from the same period in 2012, as losses and
expenses were almost unchanged. </p>
<p>Proceeds from the offering may be used for capital
contributions to support the growth of our insurance
subsidiaries, according to the filing. </p>
<p>Essent''s investors include New York-based Goldman Sachs and
Valorina LLC, which is majority owned by an entity that''s
managed by Soros Fund Management LLC, according to the filing.
The company is planning to list its shares on the New York Stock
Exchange under the ticker ESNT. </p>
<p>Mortgage insurers may benefit as the U.S. retools the
housing-finance system. President Barack Obama said in a speech
last month the government should play a smaller role covering
soured home loans and that private capital should take more risk
as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are wound down. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is poised to
pay about $900 million to settle U.S. and U.K. claims that lax
internal controls led the bank to provide inaccurate information
about last year''s record trading loss to the board, investors
and regulators, people with knowledge of the matter said. </p>
<p>The bank is set to announce deals today with four
regulators over its handling of the trades by an employee known
as the London Whale because his bets were so large, the people
said, requesting anonymity because talks were private.
Separately, the firm may also pay less than $80 million to
settle two watchdogs'' probes tied to consumer lending practices,
two people said. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, whose pay was cut in
half last year after the board said he was partially responsible
for faulty oversight of the trades, told employees in a Sept. 17
memo the bank is making an unprecedented effort to simplify
its business, overhaul controls and improve relations with
regulators. The firm has been beset by inquiries this year,
including the emergence last month of an investigation into its
hiring practices in Asia as well as criminal probes tied to
mortgage-bond sales and energy trading. </p>
<p>The package of penalties to be announced today is a message
to banks that regulators are going to really ratchet up the
fines if the organization is deemed too big to manage in order
to get the organization to simplify their structure, said
Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales Partners LLC in New
York. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. warned
that negative feedback loops triggered by waning investor
confidence are threatening India''s finances, after state-owned
lenders'' bond risk surged the most in Asia this quarter. </p>
<p>The investment bank said in a Sept. 16 report the rupee may
drop to 72 per dollar in six months from 63.385 now as weaker
capital inflows force the central bank to raise interest rates,
hurting lenders and the economy. Rising bad loans then require
more capital injections, further worsening perceptions of
India''s finances. </p>
<p>There might be a need to recapitalize banks above the
budgeted amounts, but there is not much fiscal room available
this year, Tushar Poddar, Mumbai-based economist at Goldman
Sachs, said in an interview yesterday. </p>
<p>Banking Secretary Rajiv Takru said last month authorities
may delay cash infusions into government-controlled banks, as
the International Monetary Fund forecasts the government''s
deficit will reach 8.3 percent of the economy this year, the
highest since 1987. Credit-default swap prices on State Bank of
India, a sovereign proxy, surged 32 basis points to 307 this
quarter, the worst in the Markit iTraxx Asia ex-Japan
investment-grade index. </p>
<p>The next-worst performers were also state-owned lenders.
Contracts on IDBI Bank Ltd. jumped 27 basis points to 342, while
those on Bank of India leapt 25 basis points to 325. China
Development Bank was the best performer, declining 43 basis
points to 104. </p>
<h2>Increasingly Tough'' </h2>
<p>Pacific Investment Management Co., which runs the world''s
biggest bond fund, warned this week that India faces risks of
ratings reductions. The chance of a downgrade by major credit
agencies is large even as outright default is unlikely,
Roland Mieth, Pimco Asia''s EM senior vice president, said in an
interview. </p>
<p>Compared to previous years, it''s increasingly tough now
for the government to sustain the cost of capital infusion,
said M. Narendra, chairman of Indian Overseas Bank (IOB), in a
telephone interview from Chennai yesterday. A sustained period
of difficulties is inevitable. </p>
<p>India may delay injecting capital into state-run banks
including IDBI and Indian Overseas Bank because it doesn''t want
to lose money on price declines when buying lenders'' shares,
Takru said in an Aug. 19 interview. The government, which
usually infuses cash by buying lenders'' shares, doesn''t want to
lose money on stock price declines, Takru said. While the SP
BSE Bankex index, a gauge for 13 banking stocks, has rebounded
from a 20-month low marked on Sept. 3, it remains down 17
percent this year. </p>
<h2>Slowing Economy </h2>
<p>The government needs to provide 910 billion rupees ($14.3
billion) of equity capital to state-run lenders by March 2018 in
order to maintain its current stakes, Duvvuri Subbarao, who was
governor of the Reserve Bank of India at the time, said in
October. </p>
<p>Prime Minister Manmohan Singh''s economic advisory council
said last week that containing the fiscal deficit within the
budget estimate of 4.8 percent could be a challenge. The
ratio was 4.9 percent in the year through March 31. </p>
<p>Capital adequacy ratios at the state-run banks under the
so-called Basel II rules averaged 12.4 percent as of March 31,
data compiled by the central bank show. That exceeds India''s
minimum regulatory requirement of 9 percent. A higher figure
shows lender''s ability to absorb bad loans. </p>
<p>India''s currency and bonds have dropped this year as Asia''s
third-largest economy expanded 4.4 percent last quarter from a
year earlier, the least since the three months ended March 2009. </p>
<h2>Positive Possibility </h2>
<p>The yield on India''s 7.16 percent rupee-denominated bond
due May 2023 fell 7 basis points to 8.37 percent yesterday,
according to central bank prices. It reached a five-year high of
9.23 percent on Aug. 19. The rupee was little changed yesterday
after slumping as much as 13 percent this year, making it the
worst performer in Asia. </p>
<p>I think the commitment to banks on infusing capital will
be met as it will strengthen the fundamentals of the economy,
D. R. Dogra, managing director of CARE Ratings Ltd., said in a
Sept. 17 telephone interview from Mumbai. The central bank as
a regulator will respond to the developing situation pro-actively. </p>
<p>Central bank governor Raghuram Rajan faces pressure to
signal a reversal this week in his predecessor''s tightening
measures. Rajan will hold the repurchase rate at 7.25 percent
tomorrow, his first meeting in charge of the central bank,
according to all 34 economists in a Bloomberg survey. </p>
<h2>Higher Costs </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs, whose report was meant to illustrate the
risk of feedback loops, not to predict them, wrote that there
is also the possibility of a positive circle in which any
improvement in the current account could lead to stability in
the rupee. That in turn could encourage capital inflows. </p>
<p>Takru''s retreat from earlier comments that India will
inject as much as 140 billion rupees by September comes after
the proportion of bad loans and restructured assets as a
percentage of total lending rose to a 10-year high of 10.02
percent at the end of June, central bank data show. </p>
<p>Soured loans in the banking system rose to 3.92 percent of
total lending as of June 30, the highest in at least five years,
from 3.4 percent at the end of March, according to central bank
data. </p>
<p>Expectations that the bad loan situation will worsen are
not out of place, Pratip Chaudhuri, chairman of State Bank of
India (SBIN), said in a telephone interview yesterday. It looks
imminent the government will have to bear a higher cost for
supporting the banks. </p>

<p>Federal Reserve projections for
where the federal funds rate will be in 2016 are a central piece
of information being released in conjunction with the policy-maker meeting ending today, said Goldman Sachs Group Inc. chief
economist Jan Hatzius. </p>
<p>That is the first time that FOMC participants are going
to be telling us where they see monetary policy that far out in
the future, Hatzius said of the Federal Open Market
Committee''s two-day session on Bloomberg Television''s Market
Makers with Stephanie Ruhle and Erik Schatzker. Our
expectation is that most of the participants will project
something in the low two''s, but I think there will be a
significant impact from whatever they do. </p>
<p>Fed policy makers will also probably decide today whether
to taper $85 billion in monthly bond buying at their meeting in
Washington, dialing down monthly Treasury purchases by $5
billion to $40 billion while maintaining mortgage-backed
securities purchases at $40 billion, according to a Bloomberg
News survey of economists. </p>
<p>No tapering would definitely be a surprise, Hatzius
said. Investors are very much on board with the idea that you
get some tapering. </p>
<p>The Fed will also release its economic forecasts today, and
Hatzius said it is pretty clear that 2013 growth numbers are
going to have to come down. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s physical
commodities unit is a core business that provides a crucial
service to clients, Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein
said today. </p>
<p>The role we play in that business is very, very important
to users in the market, Blankfein, 58, said in an interview
with CNBC. Without us in that market, a good credit, a
regulated company, the outcomes won''t be very good for the users
of the market. </p>
<p>U.S. lawmakers have questioned whether banks should be
allowed to own physical commodities businesses and the Federal
Reserve said it''s reviewing a decision it made a decade ago that
allowed commercial banks to enter the industry. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs hasn''t been pressured by regulators to exit
its physical commodities units, Blankfein said. The New York-based firm is in a different position than some commercial banks
because Goldman Sachs was already in the commodities business
when it became a bank holding company and didn''t need approval
from regulators later on, he said. </p>
<p>Blankfein worked in the firm''s J. Aron commodities unit,
which also produced Chief Financial Officer Harvey M. Schwartz
and President Gary D. Cohn. </p>
<p>That is a core, strategic business for us, Blankfein
said. Commodity hedging is no different to people who have
risks in the commodities markets -- which are real, iconic
American companies -- as their credit risk or interest-rate
risk. And we provide that service. </p>

<p>Arcapita Bank BSC, the Bahrain-based investment house that filed for Chapter 11 in the U.S.
last year, exited bankruptcy after receiving a $350 million loan
from Goldman Sachs International. </p>
<p>Under the terms of the restructuring deal, a new entity
named RA Holding Corp., owned by the creditors, will realize the
value of Arcapita''s investment portfolio, the bank said in a
statement on its website. The Goldman Sachs-led loan will fund
cash flow requirements of the new entity and pay obligations
connected to the restructuring, it said. </p>
<p>Companies including Kuwait''s Global Investment House KSCC,
Dubai World Corp. and Dubai-based Nakheel PJSC were forced to
restructure billions of dollars of debt after lending evaporated
and asset values plummeted during the global credit crisis.
Arcapita filed for bankruptcy in March 2012 after negotiations
with creditors over a $1.1 billion syndicated loan failed. </p>
<p>Chapter 11 was a challenging experience, but one which
has enabled us to deliver a solution in the best interests of
our investors, creditors, and other stakeholders, Chief
Executive Officer Atif Abdulmalik said in the statement. We
will be able both to assist RA and investors to maximize the
value of the existing investment portfolio and to undertake new
investment opportunities. </p>
<p>The existing management team at Arcapita will continue to
lead the bank''s investment portfolio with the aim of maximizing
sale values. </p>
<p>The reorganization is effective from Sept. 17. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. became the
second-largest shareholder in Eike Batista''s OSX Brasil SA (OSXB3) as
the shipbuilding unit of the former Brazilian billionaire faces
a possible restructuring of $500 million in bonds. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs acquired OSX shares on Sept. 3 to reach a
5.22 percent stake, the Rio de Janeiro-based company said in a
regulatory filing today. OSX is the worst-performing stock in
Batista''s commodities group this year with a 92 percent slump. </p>
<p>Batista, Brazil''s richest person until November, is selling
assets and restructuring his group of publicly traded
commodities and logistics startups after a series of missed
operational and financial targets eroded investor confidence.
Creditors representing about 60 percent of OSX bondholders hired
law firm Bingham McCutchen LLP in preparation for the possible
restructuring of the company''s 2015 bonds, two people briefed on
the arrangements told Bloomberg News on Sept. 9. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
declined to comment on the share purchase in an e-mail sent by
an external public relations representative in Brazil. </p>
<p>This is a minority investment that does not involve a
change in the composition of corporate control or a change in
the management structure of the company, the firm said in a

does not target any quantity of the company''s shares. </p>
<p>OSX fetches 0.06 times book value, making it the cheapest
stock among 264 companies trading in Brazil with a market value
of at least $100 million, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The entrepreneur created OSX to supply vessels to
sister company OGX Petroleo  Gas Participacoes SA (OGXP3), which is in
talks with creditors in a bid to avoid bankruptcy protection. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s $1.5
trillion asset management unit is buying emerging-market and
convertible bonds as it seeks higher-yielding securities with
the Federal Reserve maintaining its stimulus effort. </p>
<p>All asset prices are going to be underwritten by central
banks for the foreseeable future, Robert Michele, JPMorgan
Asset Management''s chief investment officer of fixed income and
currencies, said today on Bloomberg Television''s Market
Makers with Erik Schatzker and Stephanie Ruhle. There are
many parts of the bond market that look attractive. </p>
<p>Michele said the firm is buying equity-like fixed-income securities, including local emerging-market debt, bank
capital contingent notes and convertible bonds. </p>
<p>Investors are bolstered by the Fed''s decision yesterday to
maintain its $85 billion of monthly Treasury and mortgage-debt
purchases, surprising economists who expected the central bank
to start slowing the stimulus program. The greatest proportion
of fixed-income buyers are more overweight investment-grade
corporate bonds since February 2011, according to a September
survey by JPMorgan strategists led by Eric Beinstein. </p>
<p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year government note plunged
16 basis points, or 0.16 percentage point, to 2.69 percent
yesterday, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices, the
biggest drop since Oct. 31, 2011. </p>
<h2>Defensive'' Investors </h2>
<p>Corporate bonds in the U.S. are returning 0.4 percent this
month, paring a 4.3 percent loss in the previous four months as
concern mounted that the Fed would start slowing its
unprecedented stimulus effort. U.S. policy makers said yesterday
they want more evidence of an economic recovery before reducing
its quantitative-easing program. </p>
<p>Investors had become very defensive over the summer and
raised a lot of cash, Michele said. You start to sense that
the market is oversold. </p>
<p>Corporate bonds from developing nations are returning 1.3
percent this month, the biggest gain since October, according to
the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Emerging Markets Corporate
Plus Index, as confidence increases that easy monetary policies
will keep supporting riskier debt markets. A Bank of America

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, is paying $389 million in penalties and
restitution to settle regulators'' claims that it unfairly
charged customers for credit-monitoring products. </p>
<p>The New York-based bank will pay $60 million to the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency and $20 million to the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in penalties for improperly
billing customers for the add-on products, the agencies said
in a statement today. JPMorgan has already paid $309 million in
refunds to more than 2.1 million customers, CFPB Director
Richard Cordray said in a statement. </p>
<p>Put simply, Chase was charging consumers for services
they did not receive, Cordray said. </p>
<p>An investigation started by the OCC revealed that JPMorgan
enrolled customers in credit-monitoring programs that were sold
as add-ons to credit cards from October 2005 through June 2012,
the consumer bureau said. The bank began charging customers for
the programs before obtaining the necessary written
authorization, the regulators said. </p>
<p>The consumer bureau, created by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010,
is conducting an industrywide inquiry into various aspects of
the add-on market, including whether credit-card customers were
unknowingly enrolled in products such as credit-monitoring
services and whether banks properly oversaw contractors that
helped sell them. The probe has yielded settlements with
companies including Capital One Financial Corp. (COF), which agreed to
pay $210 million in July 2012. </p>
<p>Bill Wallace, the bank''s head of operations for consumer
and community banking, said in an e-mailed statement that the
company''s Chase Bank unit had stopped new enrollments in the
products in mid-2012. </p>
<h2>High Standards'' </h2>
<p>Any mistakes like these are regrettable and we are
committed to ensuring our partners and vendors hold themselves
to the same high standards that our customers expect of us,
Wallace said in the statement. </p>
<p>The bank still faces a CFPB investigation, disclosed last
month in a regulatory filing, over credit card debt sales. </p>
<p>Earlier today, the OCC was involved in two other
settlements with JPMorgan. It was among several regulators in
the $920 million agreement to settle allegations stemming from
the bank''s London Whale losses. The OCC also ordered the bank
repay harmed customers and fix problems with its consumer debt-collections practices. </p>

<p>Three of the world''s top 20 oil
companies by market value didn''t submit bids for Brazil''s
largest oil field amid lower-than-expected interest in the
deposit, the head of the country''s oil regulator said. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), BP Plc (BP/) and BG Group (BG/) didn''t register for
the Libra field before yesterday''s deadline, Magda Chambriard,
the head of Brazil''s oil regulator, told reporters in Rio de
Janeiro today. The number of participants was less than half of
the more than 40 companies expected by the regulator, Chambriard
said. At least a dozen companies registered, she said. </p>
<p>While Exxon, BP and BG didn''t bid because of company-specific reasons, the trio are still interested in a presence
in Brazil, Chambriard said, without elaborating. The companies
called to inform her of their decisions, she said. </p>
<p>Brazil is auctioning Libra, estimated to hold as much as 12
billion barrels of recoverable crude, under a new model for the
so-called pre-salt region where state-controlled Petroleo
Brasileiro SA (PETR3) is guaranteed operating control of new projects.
Libra will be auctioned under a profit-sharing model where
Petrobras and its partners will give the government at least
41.65 percent of production after deducting enough output to
cover costs. The government will choose the group that offers
the most so-called profit oil. </p>
<h2>Potential Opportunities'' </h2>
<p>After reviewing this opportunity, we decided not to
participate in the Libra bid round, Patrick McGinn, an Exxon
Mobil spokesman, said in an e-mailed reply to questions. We
continually look for new exploration and development
opportunities around the world where we can leverage our
experience and technology, and we look forward to evaluating
potential opportunities in Brazil. </p>
<p>BP and BG didn''t immediately reply to e-mails seeking
comment. Exxon, BP and BG all won acreage in Brazil''s most
recent auction in May when it sold onshore and offshore licenses
on the coast of northeastern Brazil. </p>
<p>UBS AG expected low interest in the auction, analysts
led by Lilyanna Yang said in a Sept. 4 note to clients. It will
take until 2021 to start selling crude from Libra, about two
years longer than ANP estimates, and higher-than-expected levels
of natural gas at the field will increase extraction costs, the
UBS analysts said. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) agreed to
repay harmed consumers and fix problems with its handling of
credit-card debt collections under an agreement with the U.S.
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency released today. </p>
<p>The New York-based bank violated rules regarding
collections practices, debt documents and sales of consumer
credit-card debt, the OCC said in a consent order. JPMorgan, the
biggest U.S. bank by assets, must provide remediation to
affected customers, improve its documentation procedures with
non-home loans and review lending accounts since 2005 for
deficiencies that need to be repaired, the OCC said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan agreed to the sanctions without admitting or
denying wrongdoing, according to today''s order. The settlement
was announced at the same time as a separate $920 million
agreement with multiple regulators over the bank''s London Whale
trades. </p>
<p>The unsafe or unsound practices identified by the OCC
were most prevalent in the Bank''s consumer and community banking
lines of business, including credit-card services, auto lending,
and student lending, according to the order. The bank''s
employees -- or those of hired third-party firms -- signed
affidavits that they personally reviewed debt documents that
were not based on such personal knowledge or review of the
relevant books and records. </p>
<p>The bank will review files and submit a plan to the
regulator on how it intends to repay those harmed. Because the
plan isn''t yet approved, the amount of remediation isn''t set. </p>
<h2>Steps Taken </h2>
<p>We have taken extensive steps over the past two years to
remediate the issues that affected customers and redesign our
practices, said Bill Wallace, the bank''s head of operations
for consumer and community banking, in a statement. Although
these issues affected less than 1 percent of Chase customers,
any mistake is regrettable and does not reflect the high
standards we set for ourselves. </p>
<p>The problems were discovered by the bank in its own
internal reviews in 2010, it said in a statement. JPMorgan said
it stopped filing credit-card collection lawsuits against
customers in early 2011 and hasn''t restarted. </p>
<p>Richard Cordray, director of the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau, has also made the debt collection industry a
top priority this year. His agency, which has been focusing on
the accuracy of information used to collect debts, is
investigating JPMorgan''s practices, the bank said in a
Securities and Exchange Commission filing last month. The
consumer agency may write a regulation to create nationwide
industry standards, Cordray said on July 10. </p>
<p>JPMorgan said in its SEC filing that it had responded to
formal and informal inquiries from both federal and state
regulators on credit-card collections. In May, the bank was sued
by the California attorney general for violating state laws on
the use of sworn documents in debt collection and taking illegal
shortcuts to pursue borrowers. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank by assets, generated the most revenue from commodities
out of the 10 biggest investment banks in the first six months
this year, according to Coalition, an analytics company. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ranked second and Morgan Stanley (MS)
was third, Coalition, based in London, said in a report today.
For all of last year, Goldman had the most revenue from
commodities, followed by JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley. Figures
for individual banks weren''t disclosed. </p>
<p>Commodity prices dropped 5.5 percent in the first half as
Chinese growth slowed and supply surpluses emerged. JPMorgan
said in July that it plans to get out of the business of owning
and trading physical commodities. </p>
<p>Revenue from raw materials fell 20 percent in the first
half to $2.7 billion and dropped 24 percent for all of last
year, to $6 billion, Coalition said. Last year''s total was less
than half the level in 2008, when oil climbed to a record.
Spokesmen for JPMorgan, Goldman and Morgan Stanley declined to
comment about their commodity rankings. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said
this year that he''s open to different structures in his bank''s
commodities unit. The firm held talks last year with Qatar''s
sovereign-wealth fund about selling a stake in the business. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s physical commodities unit is a core
business that provides a crucial service to clients, Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein said yesterday. </p>
<p>JPMorgan was the largest investment bank by revenue in the
first six months this year and also ranked first for fixed
income, currencies and commodities as a group, Coalition said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Investment Partners,
set up to allow clients to invest with some of the bank''s top
proprietary traders, is raising capital for a new Asian fund,
said two people with knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>The fund, named Oryza Capital, started early this month,
said the people, who asked not to be identified because the
information is private. It is overseen by a team led by Hideki Kinuhata in Tokyo and Hong Kong-based Ryan Thall, said the
people, who didn''t disclose how much money the fund is seeking
to gather. Kinuhata and Thall didn''t reply to e-mails seeking
comment on the new fund. Connie Ling, a Hong Kong-based
spokeswoman at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., declined to comment. </p>
<p>Asia''s economic growth that has outperformed the U.S. and
Europe, and renewed interest in Japan, where Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe has committed to ending deflation, are attracting
global investors. Inflows into Asia-focused funds took regional
hedge-fund assets to $98.4 billion as of the end of June, the
highest since 2007, according to Chicago-based data provider
Hedge Fund Research Inc. </p>
<p>Asia is still one of the fastest-growing regions in the
world, albeit at a slower pace, so it''s no surprise that there
is continued interest in notable Asian launches, Will Tan, a
managing director who focuses on the hedge-fund industry at
Singapore-based recruiting firm Principle Partners Pte, said.
The past year especially has seen renewed global interest in
Japan resulting in a surge in hiring for Japan-focused
investment professionals. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) will end its
partnership with Pirates of the Caribbean producer Jerry Bruckheimer as the company looks to rein in film costs and focus
on movies from Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm Ltd. </p>
<p>The first-look deal with Bruckheimer, one of the best-known
action producers in Hollywood, won''t be renewed when it expires
in 2014, Burbank, California-based Disney said yesterday in a
statement. They will continue to work together on projects
including the fifth Pirates of the Caribbean. </p>
<p>The decision underscores the pressure on studio Chairman
Alan Horn to limit risk while placing huge bets on a handful of
big movies with blockbuster potential. While the first four
Pirates films generated $3.73 billion at the global box
office, Disney pulled the next one from its release schedule,
and Bruckheimer stumbled in July with The Lone Ranger, which
may lose $190 million for the company. </p>
<p>We have had an incredibly successful collaboration over
the past two decades and he is a friend to many of us here,
Horn said in the statement. We will continue to work together
in the future. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer, who will be retiring within a year, said the company is still working to make sure that the personal computer remains relevant as the device of choice. </p> <p>He made his comment as Windows, which dominated computing for more than two decades, now makes up 25 percent of revenue. The operating system slipped to become Microsoft''s third-largest business after Office, which generated 32 percent of sales, and Server and Tools, which garnered 26 percent for the latest fiscal year through June. </p> <p>Ballmer''s remarks were being closely watched as he shakes up the world''s largest software maker amid a shift by consumers toward smartphones and tablets and away from PCs running Windows. The CEO overhauled Microsoft''s management and strategy to accelerate development of hardware and services, agreeing this month to buy Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)''s handset unit for $7.2 billion. </p> <p>We must do the work to ensure that the PC stays the device of choice when they''re trying to be productive in life, Ballmer said at a meeting for analysts and institutional shareholders yesterday, the first in two years. The company will have to work hard to keep the industry north of 300 million units, he said. </p> <p>Microsoft declined 2.5 percent to $32.79 at the close in New York, leaving the stock up 23 percent this year. The shares rose 7.3 percent the day Ballmer announced his retirement, then fell 4.6 percent when Microsoft said it would buy Nokia. </p> <h2>Challenging Environment </h2> <p>PC shipments will decline 9.7 percent this year to 315.4 million and won''t ever return to the peak levels it reached in 2011, according to researcher IDC. The market will shrink until 2015, it said. The slumping popularity of the devices is coming as consumers increasingly turn to smartphones and tablets, two markets where Microsoft and the PC industry have lagged. </p> <p>Windows accounted for 3.7 percent of smartphone operating-system shipments in the second quarter, according to IDC. In the tablet market, that figure was 4.5 percent, IDC said. Microsoft''s first-ever computer hardware, the Surface tablet, sold so poorly the company had to write down $900 million of unsold inventory. Introduced in October, the handheld device was aimed at taking on Apple Inc.''s iPad, as well as touchscreen computers running Google Inc.''s Android software. </p> <p>The challenges are fairly obvious and the questions are about how to execute, said Sid Parakh, an analyst at McAdams Wright Ragen in Seattle. They''ve laid out a strategy of being more of a devices- and services-focused company, and started to execute on that. Nokia is part of that. </p> <h2>Hardware Evolution </h2> <p>Ballmer is reorganizing Microsoft into fewer units around devices and services, while separating corporate tasks like marketing and finance. As part of the restructuring, the company will report results from five new segments beginning from the current fiscal first quarter, which ends this month. </p> <p>Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said she''ll give more detailed information on the company''s new financial-reporting structure on a Sept. 26 conference call with analysts. </p> <p>Ballmer told analysts that the company will perform better in the future by having its business, consumer, software and device units work together. </p> <p>Hardware and software will kind of need to evolve together, he said. </p> <h2>Long Microsoft </h2> <p>Some shareholders have been seeking more of a say in Microsoft''s strategy and finances. The company said earlier this week it will raise quarterly dividends by 22 percent to 28 cents a share, exceeding the average analyst estimate of 26 cents. Microsoft sought to head off shareholder dissent last month by reaching a cooperation agreement with ValueAct Holdings LP, which would let the activist investor claim a board seat starting next year. </p> <p>Microsoft said it''s still seeking a new CEO, and didn''t offer any updates on the process. </p> <p>The board continues on the process that we laid out in late August, Hood said at the conference, which was delayed by a power failure at the venue in Bellevue, Washington. We''ll update you when appropriate. </p> <p>There are only a few companies making the investments in data centers and technology needed to provide future devices and services that consumers and companies will demand, Ballmer said. Microsoft won''t be religious about having its services work only with Microsoft hardware, and will keep offering them on Apple and Google''s products, he said. </p> <p>Microsoft will also continue to challenge Google, which has secured a pole position in Internet search and is one of the few companies with the breadth to take on Microsoft, Ballmer said. Regulators should look at what he called Google''s monopoly in search, he said. </p> <p>I''m long Microsoft, said Ballmer, who owns about 4 percent of the company. I treasure it as an investor, too. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Chris Dolmetsch" date="Sep 20, 2013 12:23 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-20/goldman-managing-director-to-be-arraigned-on-rape-charge.html"><headline>Goldman Managing Director to Be Arraigned on Rape Charge</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) managing

woman at his rental home in East Hampton, New York, the wealthy
beach community on the east end of Long Island. </p>
<p>Jason Lee, 37, wearing a dark suit and accompanied by his
wife, was arraigned today before Suffolk County Judge Barbara
Kahn in Riverhead, New York. </p>
<p>Lee, of Manhattan, was arrested and charged with first-degree rape in August after police went to his Clover Leaf Lane
home and learned that a woman had been sexually assaulted inside
the residence, where several people had gathered, according to a
police statement. </p>
<p>A grand jury indicted Lee last month on one count of first-degree rape, which carries a maximum sentence of 25 years in
prison, and misdemeanor counts of assault and sexual misconduct,
according to court records. He was freed at the time on $20,000
cash bail. Bail was set today at $100,000 cash, with the $20,000
applied to that amount. Lee left the courthouse after posting
the additional bail. He was ordered to turn in his passport. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), seeking to
end probes of a $6.2 billion trading debacle, admitted to
violating federal securities laws and agreed to pay about $920
million for failing to implement adequate controls and providing
incomplete information to regulators and its board. </p>
<p>Senior management knew in April 2012 that the bank''s chief
investment office in London, which was responsible for the loss,
was using aggressive valuations that hid $750 million in losses,
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said yesterday in a
statement. Some executives expressed reservations at signing
off on JPMorgan''s first-quarter earnings filings last year as
required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the SEC said. </p>
<p>The settlement resolves claims by the SEC, the U.S. Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Reserve and the U.K.
Financial Conduct Authority. </p>
<p>The company was fined 137.6 million pounds ($221.2 million)
by U.K. regulators as part of a probe into last year''s record
trading loss, the Financial Conduct Authority said on its
website. </p>
<p>The Justice Department and Commodity Futures Trading
Commission are among agencies still investigating the trading
loss at the CIO, a unit of the New York-based bank that was
supposed to help reduce risk and manage excess deposits.
JPMorgan said yesterday that it was notified by the CFTC that
its staff intends to recommend enforcement action. </p>
<p>The more than $6.2 billion in losses led to the indictment
of two former traders this week, the departure of at least four
senior managers and a blow to the reputation of Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon, 57, whose pay was cut in half. </p>
<p>JPMorgan restated results and its market value fell by
almost $51 billion after disclosing errant bets made by Bruno
Iksil, a trader who became known as the London Whale because his
positions were so large. </p>

<h2>Compliance Action </h2>
<h2>Insurers Agree to Audit Workplace Pension Plans in OFT Deal </h2>
<p>U.K. insurers agreed to audit some pension plans as part of
a settlement with regulators reviewing the 275 billion-pound
($442 billion) market for defined contribution workplace
pensions. </p>
<p>Fees for the pension plans are too high and not always
transparent to consumers, the Office of Fair Trading said in a
report yesterday. The Association of British Insurers agreed to
conduct an immediate audit of older and high-charging contract
and bundled-trust schemes, containing about 30 billion pounds of
savings, to ensure participants understand the plans. </p>
<p>The regulator began an investigation into defined
contribution workplace pension plans in January. </p>
<p>We agree with the OFT that it is important to review
charges to ensure they represent good value for money for
today''s employers and savers, Otto Thoresen, the ABI''s
director general, said in a statement. Pension providers have
agreed to an audit of all legacy and higher charging schemes to
ensure any problems can be sorted out. </p>
<p>The National Association of Pension Funds, which represents
U.K. workplace pension plans and their members, said the report
didn''t go far enough to give companies more choices of pension
plans to offer their employees. </p>
<h2>Courts </h2>
<h2>BMC Software Loses Repatriation Case in U.S. Tax Court </h2>
<p>BMC Software Inc. faces a $12.9 million tax bill after the
U.S. Tax Court upheld a finding by the Internal Revenue Service
that some earnings repatriated in the mid-2000s were ineligible
for a temporarily lower tax rate. </p>
<p>BMC, based in Houston, contended that accounts receivable
on its books shouldn''t be counted as debt that would reduce the
amount of money it could bring to the U.S. from foreign
affiliates at the reduced tax rate. </p>
<p>Judge Diane Kroupa disagreed, ruling that the IRS''s
treatment of the accounts receivable are consistent with the
dictionary definition and may constitute indebtedness for
purposes of calculating how much in earnings could be taxed at
the lower rate in effect at the time. </p>
<p>Ann Duhon, a spokeswoman for BMC, said she hadn''t seen the
ruling and had no immediate comment. Christine Vaughn, of Vinson
 Elkins LLP, an attorney on the case for BMC, didn''t
immediately reply to a phone message requesting comment. </p>
<p>The 2004 repatriation program permitted U.S. corporations
to bring home income held outside the U.S. at an effective rate
of 5.25 percent instead of the top 35 percent corporate income
tax rate. </p>
<p>BMC claimed $709 million in earnings qualified for the tax
holiday. The IRS ruled that $43 million was ineligible for
taxation at the lower rate because it represented a foreign
unit''s debt to BMC created by accounts receivable, according to
court filings. </p>
<p>The case is BMC Software Inc. v. IRS, 15675-11, U.S. Tax
Court (Washington). </p>
<p>Ex-SAC Analyst Dennis Called Uncharged Co-Conspirator by U.S. </p>
<p>Ron Dennis, a former SAC Capital Advisors LP analyst, is an
uncharged co-conspirator in an insider-trading scheme involving
SAC portfolio manager Michael Steinberg, U.S. prosecutors said. </p>
<p>Steinberg, the long-serving portfolio manager at the
Stamford, Connecticut-based fund charged in the government''s
probe of insider trading, was indicted by a grand jury in
Manhattan, according to documents unsealed on March 29. He''s
scheduled to go on trial Nov. 18. </p>
<p>The U.S. alleges Steinberg engaged in insider trading in
Dell Inc. (DELL) and Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) based on illicit tips provided to him
by his analyst, Jon Horvath. The former analyst, who has pleaded
guilty and is cooperating with the U.S., is scheduled to be a
witness at Steinberg''s trial. </p>
<p>In a memo to Steinberg''s lawyers providing details on the
alleged conspiracy, prosecutors in the office of Manhattan U.S.
Attorney Preet Bharara said Horvath and Dennis were part of a
group of six analysts who obtained and passed nonpublic
information about stocks in at least 10 other technology
companies including Volterra Semiconductor Corp. (VLTR) and PMCS Sierra
Inc. Some of the tips were passed to former Diamondback Capital
Management LLC analyst Jesse Tortora, according to prosecutors.
Tortora has pleaded guilty to insider trading and is cooperating
with the U.S. </p>
<p>Steinberg faces as long as 20 years in prison if convicted. </p>
<p>Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for SAC at Sard Verbinnen
 Co., declined to comment on the government''s filing. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Steinberg, 12-cr-00121, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<h2>Cisco Officials Accused of Role in Falun Gong Monitoring </h2>
<p>Chinese and U.S. citizens accusing Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) of
conspiring with China''s government to monitor and torture
members of Falun Gong, a religious practice, have now said
officials at the company''s headquarters in San Jose, California,
were directly involved with human rights abuses. </p>
<p>Cisco''s main office helped design the surveillance and
internal security network known as Golden Shield, according
to an amended lawsuit filed Sept. 18 in federal court in San
Jose. </p>
<p>The revised complaint more directly ties Cisco and its
San Jose headquarters to human rights abuses against Falun Gong,
the plaintiffs said in a court filing. </p>
<p>In their suit against Cisco, the world''s biggest networking
equipment maker, unidentified Chinese and U.S. citizens alleged
that the company has collaborated with the Chinese Communist
Party to intercept communications of Falun Gong believers, who
were arrested, detained and tortured because of their religious
beliefs. The claim was originally filed in 2011. </p>
<p>Cisco continues to believe the entire case is without
merit and will file a motion to dismiss the amended complaint,
spokeswoman Kristin Carvell said Sept. 18 in an e-mailed
statement. </p>
<p>The plaintiffs have recycled previous allegations to try to
overcome a Supreme Court decision that the claims can''t be
brought in U.S. courts, Carvell said. </p>
<p>The case is Doe I v. Cisco Systems Inc., 11-cv-02449, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose). </p>
<h2>Interviews </h2>
<h2>Underfunded CFTC Hasn''t Grown Much in 20 Years, Gensler Says </h2>
<p>The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is
underfunded and needs more money to be an effective regulator,
Chairman Gary Gensler said. </p>
<p>The agency is only slightly larger than it was 20 years
ago, he said. Gensler made the remarks at a conference yesterday
in London. </p>
<p>We didn''t oversee swaps 20 years ago, we didn''t have
electronic trading, Gensler said. It''s critical for the
public''s confidence in a market that a regulator is well-funded. </p>
<h2>Comings and Goings </h2>
<h2>ASX Board Members Resign After SEC Action Against Hedge Fund </h2>
<p>Shane Finemore and Russell Aboud resigned from the board of
ASX Ltd. (ASX) after their hedge fund, Manikay Partners LLC, agreed to
settle claims of improperly buying shares of companies they had
bet against. </p>
<p>Aboud said by phone yesterday that he told ASX Chairman
Rick Holliday Smith he would resign. New York-based Manikay
agreed to pay $2.6 million to settle the action. </p>
<p>The hedge fund was sanctioned by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission as part of an enforcement against 23 firms,
the agency said in a statement Sept. 17. Aboud, a member of the
ASX board, is chairman of the fund. </p>
<p>He said while he doesn''t believe there are governance
issues at ASX, even a perception of an issue has the ability
to damage the company. Therefore, resigning was the right
thing to do, he said. Aboud said the action stemmed from a
Citigroup Inc. (C) share sale in 2009. </p>
<p>ASX board member Finemore is the managing partner of
Manikay. Finemore didn''t respond to e-mailed requests for
comment. The company made no admission of guilt. </p>
<p>ASX confirmed the two resignations in a statement. </p>
<p>The firms cited in the cases allegedly bought shares from
an underwriter, broker or dealer participating in a share sale
after having sold short the same security during the restricted
period, according to the SEC statement. </p>

<p>Sotheby''s (BID), the New York auctioneer
under pressure to improve returns, said Patrick McClymont, a
partner at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., is replacing its chief
financial officer of 17 years, William Sheridan. </p>
<p>A 1991 graduate of Cornell University, McClymont has been a
managing director in investment banking at Goldman since 1998,
Sotheby''s said in a release. </p>
<p>Andrew Gully, a Sotheby''s spokesman, said the move is
unrelated to corporate activism by investor Daniel Loeb, whose
Third Point LLC has taken a 5.7 percent stake in the auction
house, according to an Aug. 26 filing with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission. </p>
<p>The hedge-fund company intends to engage in a dialogue
with members of the board or management that may relate to
potential changes of strategy and leadership, the filing said. </p>
<p>Bill and Sotheby''s came to a mutual agreement that he
would no longer serve as CFO after being at Sotheby''s for 17
years, Gully said in a phone interview. </p>
<p>McClymont takes over Oct. 7. Sheridan will remain at the
company until the end of the year, according to the release. The
company said on Sept. 11 that it''s conducting a thorough
review of its capital allocation and financial policies. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) introduced two new versions of its Surface tablet, the software maker''s latest bid to challenge Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. in the hardware market after its first devices fell flat. </p> <p>The new Surface Pro, powered by an Intel Corp. chip, is 20 percent faster and features an all-day battery with 75 percent more life, Panos Panay, the company''s Surface vice president, said at an event in New York today. The Surface 2 has a high-definition screen and 25 percent better battery life, and runs on an Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) chip based on ARM Holdings Plc (ARM) technology. </p> <p>Microsoft jumped into the touch-screen tablet market, dominated by Apple''s iPad and models running Google Inc.''s Android software, in June 2012 with the announcement of its first Surface. Designed to keep its Windows software relevant as consumers shift to tablets from personal computers and laptops, the Surface instead generated such little demand that Microsoft took a $900 million inventory writedown last quarter. </p> <p>Microsoft bet the farm on touch and tablet, said Wes Miller, an analyst at Directions on Microsoft, a Kirkland, Washington-based research firm. They''ve got to move some serious tablets, he said. </p> <h2>Thinner Covers </h2> <p>Microsoft said the devices will go on sale on Oct. 22. The Pro, which runs on Intel''s Haswell chip, starts at $899, and the Surface 2, the successor to the Surface RT, starts at $449. The company also introduced new, thinner versions of the device''s covers that come with built-in keyboards -- and one model boosts the tablets'' battery life even further. There''s also a docking station that lets the Surface Pro connect to a computer monitor and speakers. </p> <p>This is the most powerful tablet in the world, Panay said of the new Surface Pro. This thing''s a beast. </p> <p>The Surface 2 is priced at $50 less than its predecessor when it was introduced. The new Pro starts at the same price as the earlier model when it debuted. That may still be too high to attract more buyers, though Microsoft has packed more powerful chips and hardware into the Pro to try to make it a better value, Miller said. </p> <p>It''s going to be interesting to see how the market receives it -- they''re both still premium-priced devices, he said. They were inspired by Apple''s model, which is you create premium devices and premium accessories and you hope that people are willing to pay premium prices. </p> <p>Surface 2 comes with a copy of Microsoft''s Office applications, and both devices include free Skype Internet-based calls to landlines internationally, Skype Wi-Fi and free storage on Microsoft''s cloud service. </p> <h2>Little Traction </h2> <p>The Redmond, Washington-based company has thus far failed to get traction in the market. Surface accounted for 0.7 percent of the 44.3 million tablets sold in the second quarter, according to researcher IDC. The device was too expensive, riddled with software bugs and featured too few applications, Miller said. </p> <p>Android controlled 62.6 percent of the tablet market and Apple had 32.5 percent, according to IDC. Android software is used in tablets manufactured by companies including Samsung and Sony Corp. </p> <p>Tablet shipments will top those of PCs for the first time in the fourth quarter, IDC said earlier this month. Some 84.1 million tablets will be shipped, compared with 83.1 million PCs, the researcher said. </p> <p>Microsoft entered the tablet hardware market in part because traditional manufacturers of Windows computers weren''t stepping up with compelling devices. Still, among Windows tablets with Intel chips, Surface is being outsold by vendors like Acer Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ), IDC said. </p> <h2>Hardware Competition </h2> <p>While giving a boost to the Windows business, the competition hurts the prospects of Microsoft''s hardware unit, fueling opposition from investors, who have balked at the Surface writedown and Microsoft''s agreement to spend $7.2 billion on Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)''s handset unit. </p> <p>For Windows, Surface is less important as long as other people''s tablets do OK, Miller said. The hardware challenge poses an interesting conundrum given that Microsoft just bought a phone company. </p> <p>Microsoft said it sold $853 million worth of Surface tablets in the fiscal year that ended June 30. To sell more devices, the company has cut prices, and earlier this month it started offering at least $200 in coupons to its retail stores if customers traded in a used iPad. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Michael J. Moore" date="Sep 23, 2013 11:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-23/goldman-sachs-said-to-expand-electronic-bond-trading-sessions.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Said to Expand Electronic Bond-Trading Sessions</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) has added
trading sessions and increased the money it makes available to
buy securities on its electronic bond-trading platform as the
industry grapples with changes in market structure, according to
a person briefed on the decision. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs will hold two daily sessions on its platform,
up from twice weekly when it started last year, and will offer
$300 million in guaranteed liquidity, said the person, who asked
not to be identified because the change hadn''t been publicly
announced. The platform, known as GSessions, was halted last
month amid a lack of demand, the person said. </p>
<p>Corporate bond dealers and investors have started
electronic-trading platforms as they seek to reduce costs and
improve their ability to convert investments into cash amid new
capital rules. The world''s biggest dealers have cut inventories
of corporate debt by three-quarters since the 2007 peak, leading
to concerns that waning liquidity provides greater potential for
market disruptions. </p>
<p>While clients have been wary of trading on so-called
single-dealer platforms run by one bank, the sell-side hasn''t
agreed on parameters that would allow one multidealer platform
to emerge, according to two people involved in the market. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs began trading on GSessions in June 2012,
after a year of development. The expansion will allow clients to
trade 35 bonds -- including investment-grade and high-yield
securities -- each day, the person said. GSessions is housed
within the New York-based bank''s credit-trading unit and remains
a small part of that group''s revenue, according to the person. </p>
<h2>Technology Shifts </h2>
<p>Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to
comment. The Financial Times reported the changes to Goldman
Sachs''s system yesterday. </p>
<p>The corporate bond market is unsuitable for full electronic
trading, according to a study last month by McKinsey  Co. and
Greenwich Associates. The bond market has more securities
compared with listed stocks and its issues trade at a lower
frequency, making a full transition to computer-based buying and
selling unlikely, the consultants said. </p>
<p>BlackRock Inc. (BLK), the world''s biggest asset manager, set up
an internal electronic bond-trading system that would match
orders from buy-side investors, allowing them to bypass Wall
Street dealers. The system failed in April because it couldn''t
attract a critical mass of customers, even as small dealers
stood ready to aid trading. The New York-based firm said in
April it would instead route trades through MarketAxess Holding
Inc.''s electronic system. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) revamped its electronic brokering system,
called Bond Pool, last year, offering sessions based on client
interest. JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Citigroup Inc. announced
plans to start electronic bond-trading platforms this year. </p>
<p>While technology and shifts in market structure have added
to the appearance of fixed-income market liquidity, they have
added little depth, according to a July report by the Treasury
Borrowing Advisory Committee. Trading volumes of investment-grade debt dropped in August to the lowest since 2008. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s private-equity fund and General Atlantic LLC are in talks to buy a 12.75
percent stake in STP -- Servicos  Tecnologia de Pagamentos SA,
the Brazilian electronic-toll-collection company, two people
with direct knowledge of the matter said. </p>
<p>Toll-road operator EcoRodovias Infraestrutura  Logistica
SA hired Banco Itau BBA SA to sell its stake in Osasco-based STP
for about 250 million reais ($114 million), the people said,
asking not to be identified because the negotiations are
private. The talks, which include additional potential buyers,
are preliminary and may not lead to a deal, the people said. </p>
<p>The number of vehicles traveling Brazil''s toll roads rose
4.2 percent in the past 12 months, according to Brazil''s
Association of Highway Concessionaires. STP sells Sem Parar and
Via Facil tags, which car owners use to pay tolls and parking
fees. CCR SA (CCRO3), the biggest toll operator by revenue, and CCBR
Catel Construcoes do Brasil Ltda are STP''s biggest shareholders,
with a combined 73.25 percent, according to data on STP''s
website. </p>
<p>STP said last month it agreed to sell a 10 percent stake to
Raizen Energia SA, a joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell Plc
and Cosan SA Industria  Comercio, for 250 million reais, in a
capital increase that will dilute holdings of most existing
shareholders when completed. Highway-concession company Arteris
SA will retain its 4.68 percent stake after the deal, which must
still to be approved by Brazil''s antitrust regulator. </p>
<h2>FleetCor Acquisition </h2>
<p>FleetCor Technologies Inc., a Norcross, Georgia-based
provider of fuel cards and workforce payment products to
businesses, said on Sept. 10 it agreed to acquire DB Trans SA, a
provider of payment solutions for independent truckers in Brazil
and also an electronic-toll-collection company. </p>
<p>STP, EcoRodovias and Itau declined to comment, according to
officials who asked not to be named in keeping with company
policies. </p>
<p>Andrea Raphael, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman, declined to
comment in a e-mailed statement. Pat Hedley, a spokeswoman for
General Atlantic, said the company''s policy is not to comment on
investments it may be considering. </p>

<p>(Corrects second paragraph to show Canada, Germany and
Children''s Investment Fund Foundation are among those
contributing the $94 million.) </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and the Bill 
Melinda Gates Foundation formed an investment fund that will
back late-stage development of technologies to fight killer
diseases in low-income countries. </p>
<p>A group of investors including the Canadian and German
governments and the Children''s Investment Fund Foundation
committed $94 million to the fund. The International Finance
Corp., GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK), Merck  Co. (MRK), Pfizer Inc. (PFE)''s
foundation, Storebrand ASA (STB) and JPMorgan Chase also invested. The
Global Health Investment Fund will tackle diseases including
malaria, tuberculosis and HIV, as well as maternal and infant
mortality, according to a statement. </p>
<p>The private financing seeks to address the fact that global
health funding barely grew last year. The U.S. and other
governments cut their aid to programs in developing nations by
4.4 percent, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and
Evaluation. </p>
<p>The Global Health Investment Fund demonstrates the
potential for innovative collaborations and thoughtful financial
structures to mobilize new sources of capital for social
challenges, said Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive
officer of JPMorgan Chase. This product brings a diverse group
of investors together around the shared objective of developing
life-saving technologies in a financially sustainable way. </p>
<p>Given the risks of investing in the clinical development of
new technologies, the Gates Foundation and the Swedish
International Development Cooperation Agency will partially
offset potential losses in the fund, which will seek a financial
return for investors by targeting technologies with public
health applications in both developed and emerging markets. </p>
<p>Lion''s Head Global Partners LLP, a London-based asset
manager specializing in sustainable development, will be
responsible for originating, managing and exiting the fund''s
portfolio investments. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. upgraded
equities in Turkey, Peru and South Africa, saying the Federal
Reserve''s decision to keep monetary stimulus intact would spur
emerging-market stocks for the rest of the year. </p>
<p>Investors should add domestic cyclical stocks listed in
Istanbul, Johannesburg and Mumbai, which underperformed their
benchmarks since June, JPMorgan analysts including Adrian Mowat
said in the e-mailed report dated Sept. 21. The New York-based
investment bank downgraded Russian stocks on falling oil prices. </p>
<p>The MSCI Emerging Markets Index jumped 2.2 percent the most
in more than two months, on Sept. 19, the day after the Fed
refrained from trimming its $85 billion monthly quantitative-easing program. Turkey, South Africa and India, which are facing
among the biggest current-account deficits in developing
countries, are the main beneficiaries of the move, JPMorgan
said. Turkiye Halk Bankasi AS (HALKB) and ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) are among its
top-10 emerging stock picks. </p>
<p>The Fed is allowing investors to temporarily'' relive the
happy days of QE-driven EM bonds and equities, JPMorgan said
in the report. The switch to bullish EM equities was built on
bearish positioning and improving cyclical data in EM. </p>
<p>The investment bank raised Turkey and Peru to overweight,
joining Mexico, Thailand, the Philippines and Taiwan. South
Africa was raised to neutral and Malaysia was cut to neutral.
The MSCI gauge was little changed at 1:13 p.m. in London. </p>
<h2>Russia Downgrade </h2>
<p>Lower oil prices are a downside risk for Russia, JPMorgan
said, lowering the country and Colombia to underweight, on par
with Brazil. The Micex Index (INDEXCF) fell for a second day in Moscow,
losing 0.6 percent to 1,468.08. Crude oil in New York has fallen
3.1 percent this month, trimming the quarterly gain to 8.1
percent. </p>
<p>Oil price is on thin ice given the receding threat of a
military action by the U.S. and supply appears to be improving,
particularly in Iraq and Libya, JPMorgan said. </p>
<p>The U.S., France and the U.K. want a United Nations
resolution this week that provides enforcement of the terms of
the Sept. 14 Geneva accord between the U.S. and Russia to rid
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad''s regime of chemical weapons. </p>
<p>Equities in Thailand and the Philippines should advance,
along with Indonesia, where the key risk stems from an
overvalued rupiah and declining foreign-exchange reserves,
according to JPMorgan. The investment bank lowered Taiwanese and
Korean financial-services stocks to neutral from overweight
after higher interest rates helped them outperform. The Kopsi
Finance Index has gained 5 percent this year in Seoul, compared
with a 0.6 percent increase for the broader measure. </p>
<p>JPMorgan also advised investors to stay away from policy-risk sectors that are value traps, including Chinese financial
companies, Brazilian banks, Indian materials and energy
companies and utilities in various countries. </p>

<p>The biggest U.S. banks'' fixed-income trading revenue will probably fall 20 percent in the
third quarter from a year ago on lower volumes, according to
Richard Staite, an analyst at Atlantic Equities LLP. </p>
<p>Staite cut his estimate for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s per-share earnings 18 percent to $2.47 and Morgan Stanley''s 25
percent to 38 cents, according to a research note today. Staite
also cut his estimate at Citigroup Inc. (C) by 14 percent to $1.05. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S. bank, and Barclays
Plc have told investors that third-quarter trading revenue will
probably drop from a year earlier. Jefferies Group LLC said last
week that revenue from fixed-income trading plunged 88 percent
in its fiscal third quarter that ended Aug. 31 compared with the
same period in 2012. </p>
<p>July and August were very slow months as investors sat on
the sidelines waiting for more clarity on Fed tapering, Syria
and the emerging-market slowdown, and we believe the weakness
has extended into September, Staite wrote in a note, referring
to uncertainty about when the Federal Reserve would slow its $85
billion-a-month bond-buying program. In contrast September
2012 was very active in rates and foreign exchange due to
improvements in the Eurozone. </p>
<p>Mortgage production revenue at the biggest banks will
probably be down 55 percent, Staite added. That''s because the
third quarter in 2012 was a strong period for both volumes and
margins, he said. </p>
<h2>1,800 Jobs </h2>
<p>Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), the biggest U.S. mortgage lender, said
last week that it''s cutting about 1,800 jobs in its home-loan
production business as rising interest rates curb demand for
refinancing. Chief Financial Officer Timothy Sloan said Sept. 9
that the San Francisco-based bank may originate about $80
billion in home loans during the third quarter, a 29 percent
decline from the three months that ended June 30. </p>
<p>Staite previously cut his estimates for JPMorgan by 14
percent and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) by 10 percent following their
comments at a conference, he wrote. Wells Fargo''s estimates were
held flat. </p>
<p>We think Bank of America will show better underlying cost
and revenue trends than its major peers, Staite said. </p>
<p>Atlantic Equities has an underweight recommendation on
Morgan Stanley (MS), U.S. Bancorp, and Wells Fargo, a neutral
rating on Goldman Sachs, and an overweight recommendation on
Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan and PNC Financial Services
Group Inc. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, is paying $389 million in penalties and
restitution to settle regulators'' claims that it unfairly
charged customers for credit-monitoring products. </p>
<p>The New York-based bank will pay $60 million to the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency and $20 million to the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in penalties for improperly
billing customers for the add-on products, the agencies said
in a statement Sept. 20. JPMorgan has already paid $309 million
in refunds to more than 2.1 million customers, CFPB Director
Richard Cordray said in a statement. </p>
<p>An investigation started by the OCC revealed that JPMorgan
enrolled customers in credit-monitoring programs that were sold
as add-ons to credit cards from October 2005 through June 2012,
the consumer bureau said. The bank began charging customers for
the programs before obtaining the necessary written
authorization, the regulators said. </p>
<p>The consumer bureau, created by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010,
is conducting an industrywide inquiry into various aspects of
the add-on market. </p>
<p>Bill Wallace, the bank''s head of operations for consumer
and community banking, said in an e-mailed statement that the
company''s Chase Bank unit had stopped new enrollments in the
products in mid-2012. </p>
<p>Any mistakes like these are regrettable and we are
committed to ensuring our partners and vendors hold themselves
to the same high standards that our customers expect of us,
Wallace said in the statement. </p>
<p>The bank still faces a CFPB investigation, disclosed last
month in a regulatory filing, over credit card debt sales. </p>
<h2>Compliance Action </h2>
<h2>Barclays Cybercrime Suspects Arrested Over $2.1 Million Theft </h2>
<p>London police arrested eight men in connection to a 1.3
million pound ($2.1 million) computer-aided robbery from a
Barclays Plc (BARC) branch in the capital. </p>
<p>The money was taken from the Swiss Cottage branch via the
bank''s computer system in April, the Metropolitan Police said in
a statement Sept. 20. Barclays has recovered a significant
amount of the stolen funds, police said. </p>
<p>The men, who are between 24 and 47, were arrested Sept. 19
and 20 and are in custody in a London police station. Searches
were carried out at addresses across London where cash, jewelry,
drugs and credit cards have been found. </p>
<p>The Sept. 20 arrests marked the second time in a week that
London police announced arrests over suspected bank hacking. The
Met said on Sept. 13 it detained twelve men over an attempt to
hack into Banco Santander SA (SAN) computers, preventing a theft
potentially worth millions of pounds. </p>
<p>Banks face cyber-security threats from increasingly
sophisticated hackers trying to steal customer identities or
access funds. In the Barclays case, police said a man posing as
an information technology engineer had installed a device in the
local branch that allowed the group to remotely transfer money
to accounts. </p>
<p>Barclays has no higher priority than the protection and
security of our customers against the actions of would-be
fraudsters, Alex Grant, a managing director for fraud
prevention at the bank, said in a statement. We can confirm
that no customers suffered financial loss as a result of this
action. </p>
<h2>Co-Op Deal With Regulator Cited as Bailout Obstacle by Creditors </h2>
<p>The parent of Co-operative Bank Plc, which is seeking
capital after losses, may avoid being forced to rescue the
lender thanks to an accord it struck with regulators last year,
according to bondholders. </p>
<p>Co-Op Group Chief Executive Officer Euan Sutherland said in
a letter to an unidentified bondholder, which was seen by
Bloomberg News, that the Financial Services Authority agreed not
to classify the firm as a mixed financial holding company.
That would mean Co-Op can''t be forced to inject capital into the
lender, Mark Taber, the organizer of a group of bondholders,
said in a separate letter dated Sept. 19 to the Prudential
Regulation Authority, or PRA, which along with the Bank of
England replaced the FSA as the banking industry''s regulators
this year. </p>
<p>Co-Op Bank must raise 1.5 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) to
plug a capital hole after losses incurred following its
acquisition of Britannia Building Society in 2009. The FSA
granted the waiver to the parent before the completion of a
planned purchase to acquire 632 branches owned by Lloyds Banking
Group Plc (LLOY) last year, Sutherland wrote in the letter. </p>
<p>Liam Parker, a spokesman for the PRA, declined to
immediately comment on the contents of the page-long letter
dated Sept. 18. </p>
<p>The FSA granted a three-year waiver from CGL being
considered a mixed financial holding company and put the matter
beyond doubt, Sutherland wrote in the letter. That waiver
remains in force. </p>
<h2>Telfer to Pay $194,000 Costs in Settlement With Canada''s OSC </h2>
<p>Goldcorp Inc. (G) Chairman Ian Telfer agreed to pay C$200,000
($194,000) in costs and will be banned from arranging for people
to buy shares in companies he promotes for one year in a
settlement over allegations that he violated Canadian securities
laws. </p>
<p>Telfer admitted his conduct fell below standards expected
from his position in capital markets, Cullen Price, a lawyer
representing Ontario Securities Commission staff, said at a
hearing Sept. 20 in Toronto. Telfer was reprimanded by the OSC
as part of the settlement and will make the payment to cover the
cost of the investigation, Price said. </p>
<p>The settlement is reasonable and appropriate, said Telfer''s
lawyer Kevin Richard. </p>
<p>The sanctions don''t include a prohibition on acting as a
director and officer of a public company, which was among the
potential penalties Telfer faced. </p>
<h2>Courts </h2>
<h2>Unitech Can Claim Deutsche Bank Libor Dishonesty, Judge Rules </h2>
<p>Unitech Ltd. (UT), an Indian property firm, won permission from
a London judge to argue that Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) dishonestly fixed
interest rates in a U.K. trial over a derivative contract. </p>
<p>While Unitech can''t use rigging allegations to annul the
disputed interest-rate swap, it can file a counter-claim for
damages caused by the German lender''s alleged attempts to
influence the London interbank offered rate, Judge Nigel Teare
said Sept. 20. </p>
<p>Both the swap dispute and any claim linked to Libor must be
decided at a trial, he said in a written ruling. </p>
<p>U.K. judges have taken differing approaches on lawsuits
related to Libor-fixing allegations, which led to criminal and
regulatory probes across the globe and fines totaling about $2.5
billion for investment banks that tried to manipulate the
interest-rate benchmark for profit. </p>
<p>Unitech lost its first attempt in February to add Libor
allegations to its U.K. lawsuit. Another judge allowed a suit to
proceed against Barclays Plc for fraud related to the benchmark
and swaps. Both decisions were appealed and will be decided in a
joint appeal-court hearing scheduled for October. </p>
<p>This is a long-standing case of a loan that was made and
never paid back, said Kathryn Hanes, a London spokeswoman for
Deutsche Bank. Unitech''s unfounded allegations about Libor are
an attempt to delay payment and divert attention from its
remaining unpaid debt on a swap agreement tied to the loan. </p>
<p>Unitech''s lawyer, Richard Gwynne, didn''t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment. </p>
<h2>Swipe-Fee Rules to Remain in Place During Appeal, Judge Says </h2>
<p>The U.S. Federal Reserve''s rules for debit-card transaction
fees and processing will remain in place while the central bank
appeals a decision throwing out the regulations, a judge said. </p>
<p>Both the Fed and retailers had asked the federal judge in
Washington to keep the current rules in place pending the
appeal. </p>
<p>The Fed is seeking to reverse Leon''s ruling that it wrongly
set the cap on debit-card transaction fees, known as swipe fees,
at about 21 cents for each transaction, and neglected to bolster
competition among payment networks. </p>
<p>The decision by U.S. District Judge Richard Leon''s, unless
overturned on appeal, will force regulators to revisit rules
that bankers said would cost them 45 percent of their swipe-fee
revenue. Lenders collected about $16 billion annually from those
fees before the Fed''s regulation and responded by cutting back
on perks such as rewards programs and free checking to soften
the blow to their profits. </p>
<p>The case is NACS v. Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System, 11-cv-02075, U.S. District Court, District of
Columbia (Washington). </p>
<h2>Interviews </h2>
<h2>Buffett Calls Federal Reserve History''s Greatest Hedge Fund </h2>
<p>Billionaire investor Warren Buffett compared the U.S.
Federal Reserve to a hedge fund because of the central bank''s
ability to profit from bond purchases while accumulating a
balance sheet of more than $3 trillion. </p>
<p>The Fed is the greatest hedge fund in history, Buffett
told students Sept. 19 at Georgetown University in Washington.
It''s generating $80 billion or $90 billion a year probably
in revenue for the U.S. government, he said. And that wasn''t
the case a few years back. </p>
<p>The central bank has been buying $85 billion of bonds a
month to help the U.S. recover as it emerges from the deepest
slump since the Great Depression. Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and
other Fed policy makers unexpectedly opted last week to sustain
that pace of asset purchases instead of tapering it, saying they
need to see more signs of lasting improvement in the economy. </p>
<p>The Fed is under no pressure, none whatsoever to have to
deleverage, Buffett said. So it can pick its time, and if
you have somebody wise there -- and I think Bernanke is wise,
and I certainly expect his successor to be -- it can be handled.
But it is something that''s never quite been done on this scale.
It will be interesting to watch. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s asset-management business hired Gareth Haslip to lead U.K. strategy

oversees more than $90 billion. </p>
<p>Haslip previously was a director at Aon Benfield Securities
and Aon Hewitt''s Insurance Asset Solutions, units of broker Aon
Plc (AON), according to a statement today from New York-based
JPMorgan. Prior to that, he worked in Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s
asset-management business, focusing on insurance clients. </p>
<p>Gareth''s extensive experience of advising insurance
companies on their investments will further strengthen our
capabilities and deep working relationships with insurance
companies in the U.K., Douglas Niemann, head of strategy and

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is altering its
compensation plan so that the company can use special equity
incentives to retain executives during a transition to a new
chief executive officer. </p>
<p>The software maker''s board approved the potential stock
awards, which will vest over a term of at least 30 months,
seeking to ensure continuity of key leaders during the
transition, Microsoft said in a filing yesterday. </p>
<p>Steve Ballmer, Microsoft''s CEO since 2000, said last month
that he will retire within a year and directors are currently
looking for his replacement among internal and external
candidates. The change in leadership is happening amid the
company''s biggest reorganization in more than a decade, as it
grapples with a decline in personal-computer sales as consumers
shift to smartphones and tablets. Adding to the upheaval,
Microsoft said earlier this month that it plans to acquire Nokia
Oyj (NOK1V)''s handset business. </p>
<p>While the incentive is also aimed at making sure key
executives have sufficient unvested equity to provide alignment
with shareholders, the stock awards won''t exceed share limits
previously in place, the Redmond, Washington-based company said
in the filing. </p>
<p>Some Microsoft executives sought to reassure spooked
managers by e-mailing their staff last month to say they remain
committed to the CEO''s reorganization plan, even after Ballmer
said he would retire, people with knowledge of the matter had
said. Some executives saw an increase in outside job offers
since the restructuring plan was unveiled in July, and others
may be tempted to leave since stock grants and bonuses are
awarded in late August, said the people. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) resumed
settlement talks with the U.S. as the government was preparing
to sue the bank in California alleging it misrepresented the
quality of mortgage-backed securities sold from 2005 to 2007,
according to a person familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>The government informed JPMorgan it was ready to file a
complaint yesterday in Sacramento, the person said. Shortly
after, talks between the bank and Justice Department officials
over a possible settlement restarted, said the person, who asked
not to be identified because the matter isn''t public. </p>
<p>JPMorgan wanted to negotiate an accord resolving mortgage-bond investigations being conducted by federal and state
authorities, including probes by the U.S. attorneys in
Sacramento, Philadelphia and Washington, according to another
person briefed on the effort. </p>
<p>The bank also tried to settle a $6 billion claim by the
Federal Housing Finance Agency and an investigation by New York
Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who sued the company in
October over mortgage bonds packaged by Bear Stearns Cos., which
JPMorgan acquired in 2008, according to the person, who asked
not to be identified because the talks are private. </p>
<p>The FHFA sued the bank and 17 other lenders two years ago
over faulty mortgage bonds. </p>
<p>Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment on settlement negotiations. Adora Andy
Jenkins, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Justice Department, and
Peter Garuccio, a spokesman for FHFA, also declined to comment. </p>
<h2>Compliance Action </h2>
<h2>BofA Told to Pay $2.2 Million in Race Bias Case Spanning Decades </h2>
<p>Bank of America Corp. was ordered to pay $2.2 million to
black job applicants who were unfairly rejected for teller and
clerical positions in a case spanning almost two decades,
according to the U.S. Department of Labor. </p>
<p>An administrative judge told the bank to pay $964,000 to
more than 1,000 applicants from 1993 and $1.22 million to 113
people who were rejected from 2002 to 2005, the regulator said
yesterday in a statement. The lender also was ordered to make
job offers to 10 people. The firm settled separate claims of
racial and gender bias at its Merrill Lynch unit in the past
month. </p>
<p>The Labor Department complaint stems from a routine review
of hiring practices at an office in the firm''s hometown of
Charlotte, North Carolina, according to the statement. After
talks broke down, the government filed an administrative
complaint in 1997, asserting the federally insured bank was
subject to laws covering U.S. contractors, the agency said. The
firm challenged that authority, according to the statement. </p>
<p>Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. lender by assets,
said it''s examining the recommended decision and order. </p>
<p>Diversity and inclusion are part of our culture and core
company values, said Christopher Feeney, a company spokesman.
We actively promote an environment where all employees have
the opportunity to succeed. </p>
<h2>Courts </h2>
<h2>JPMorgan Chase Said to Be Sued Over Libor With 12 Other Banks </h2>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., Barclays Plc (BARC), Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)
and 10 other international lenders were sued by a U.S. credit
union regulator alleging they illegally manipulated benchmark
Libor interest rates. </p>
<p>The National Credit Union Administration, an Alexandria,
Virginia-based regulator, said it sued the banks Sept. 23 at a
U.S. court in Kansas. The filing couldn''t immediately be
confirmed in court records. </p>
<p>Their alleged manipulation resulted in a loss of income
from investments and other assets held by five failed corporate
credit unions: U.S. Central, WesCorp, Members United, Southwest
and Constitution, according to an NCUA statement. </p>
<p>The banks are accused of giving false information in
response to a daily survey by the British Bankers'' Association,
which asks lenders how much it would cost to borrow money from
each other for various intervals in 10 different currencies. </p>
<p>Libor, the London interbank offered rate, is a key metric
to set interest rates for trillions of dollars in financial
instruments. </p>
<p>The misinformation allowed them to benefit their
investments that were tied to Libor, to reduce their borrowing
costs, to deceive the marketplace as to the true state of their
creditworthiness, and to deprive investors of the interest rate
payments to which they were entitled, according to the NCUA. </p>
<p>Kerrie Ann Cohen, a New York-based spokeswoman for
Barclays, declined to comment on the allegations. </p>
<p>Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
and Drew Benson, a spokesman for Credit Suisse, also declined to
comment. </p>
<p>The case is National Credit Union Administration Board v.
Credit Suisse Group AG, U.S. District Court, District of Kansas. </p>
<h2>Ex-SAC Manager Martoma Has Assets Frozen in Insider Case </h2>
<p>A judge in Manhattan yesterday froze the Florida home and
other assets of former SAC Capital Advisors LP manager Mathew
Martoma, who is charged in a $276 million insider trading case. </p>
<p>The U.S. claims the assets, including Martoma''s $1.9
million Boca Raton home and more than $4 million in accounts
held by Martoma and his wife, were derived from the alleged
crime. The government is seeking forfeiture if Martoma is
convicted. </p>
<p>Prosecutors and lawyers representing Martoma agreed to the
order, which bars him from transferring the property while the
case against him goes forward. </p>
<p>The U.S. claims Martoma used inside information from two
doctors who were involved in the clinical trial of the
Alzheimer''s disease drug bapineuzumab, or bapi, to trade in
shares of Elan Corp. (ELN) and Wyeth on behalf of SAC, the hedge fund
company founded by Steven A. Cohen. The government has called it
the biggest criminal insider-trading case against an individual
in history. </p>
<p>Martoma was paid a $9.3 million bonus tied to the illegal
trades, prosecutors claim. SAC, based in Stamford, Connecticut,
was indicted in July, partly because of Martoma''s alleged
illegal trading. </p>
<p>Martoma has pleaded not guilty. His trial is scheduled to
begin Nov. 4. It may be delayed at his lawyer''s request and to
accommodate court schedules. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Martoma, 12-cr-00973, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<h2>Bank of New York Mellon Wins Case Over Interest Deductions </h2>
<p>Bank of New York Mellon Corp. is entitled to deduct
interest on a loan linked to a transaction with a British bank
that generated disallowed tax credits, a U.S. Tax Court judge
ruled. </p>
<p>The loan served a purpose beyond the creation of the tax
benefits, Judge Diane Kroupa wrote in an opinion released
Sept. 23. </p>
<p>Kroupa''s decision grew out of her ruling earlier this year
that BNY Mellon couldn''t claim $199 million of tax credits and
related expense deductions for 2001 and 2002 from a series of
transactions with London-based Barclays Plc (BCS) because they had no
economic substance. </p>
<p>BNY Mellon didn''t challenge Kroupa''s ruling on the tax
credits and instead argued that since she ruled that the loan
proceeds could be used by the bank for business purposes,
interest on them is deductible. Kroupa agreed with that
analysis. The ruling didn''t indicate the amount of interest at
stake. </p>
<p>Kevin Heine, a spokesman for BNY Mellon, declined to
comment on the ruling. </p>
<p>The case is Bank of New York Mellon Corp. v. IRS, 09-26683,
U.S. Tax Court (Washington). </p>

<h2>U.S. Bank Agency Invites Foreign Regulators to Review Its Work </h2>
<p>The regulator of U.S. national banks is inviting overseas
counterparts to find flaws in its practices that may have caused
the agency to miss early signs of the coming financial crisis
more than five years ago. </p>
<p>Comptroller of the Currency Thomas Curry said he has asked
regulators from Australia, Singapore and Canada to review his
agency''s bank supervision methods even as the OCC conducts its
own performance evaluation. </p>
<p>Curry made the comments in remarks prepared for delivery at
an American Banker regulatory conference this week in Arlington,
Virginia. </p>
<p>The OCC was among regulators criticized by lawmakers for
missing early evidence that the financial system was under
threat before the crisis, as well as for overlooking initial
signs of money-laundering violations at HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) and
trades at JPMorgan Chase  Co. </p>
<p>We''ll be looking at everything from agency culture to our
approach to risk identification, Curry said in his remarks,
and we''ll be looking for gaps in the system that might have
led us to miss problems in the past. </p>
<p>Australia, Singapore and Canada were selected as countries
that weathered the 2008 global credit crisis well, Curry said.
They will conduct an independent peer review of the process we
use for the supervision of large banks and thrifts -- an
evaluation he said could be frankly painful for those at the
OCC, Curry said. </p>

<p>A group of Ecuadorians lost a bid
to remove a U.S. judge set to oversee a trial over Chevron
Corp. (CVX)''s claims that a $19 billion pollution verdict against it
in the South American country was obtained fraudulently. </p>
<p>Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, today won a
decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals in Manhattan rejecting
the Ecuadorians'' attempt to have a new judge take up the case
and to reverse several orders by the current judge. The three-judge appeals panel issued its ruling just hours after hearing
arguments over the matter. </p>
<p>Theodore Olson, a lawyer for the San Ramon, California-based company, argued today that U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan has been comprehensive and thorough, and that a
switch would be a waste of resources. </p>
<p>That remedy they seek is utterly unwarranted, he said
of the Ecuadorians'' request. </p>
<p>Residents from the country''s Lago Agrio area near the
Colombian border have sought damages for about 20 years for
pollution in the Amazon rainforest that they allege was caused
by Texaco. Chevron, which bought Texaco in 2001, claims the
Ecuadorians and their legal adviser, Steven Donziger, improperly
influenced a court in that country to issue a $19 billion
verdict in 2011. </p>
<p>A trial over the fraud allegations is scheduled for Oct. 15
in Manhattan. </p>
<p>I can''t tell you how many motions or proceedings there
have been in the case before Kaplan, Olson told the appeals
panel, referencing years of litigation and more than 1,400
docket entries. Our opponents have won a lot of those. </p>
<h2>Inappropriate Findings </h2>
<p>James Tyrrell, a lawyer for two of the Ecuadorian
claimants, argued that Kaplan issued inappropriate findings in
previous orders that conflicted with an earlier decision by the
appeals court. Tyrrell also contended that the judge is
accommodating the oil company''s effort to encourage courts
around the world not to enforce the Ecuador verdict. </p>
<p>Chevron denies there was company wrongdoing in Ecuador and
claims that Texaco cleaned up its share of the pollution at its
former oil fields, which were taken over by state-owned
PetroEcuador. The U.S. company also said that it was released
from future liability by an agreement between Texaco and
Ecuador. </p>
<p>This month, Chevron said it won''t seek money damages
against the two Ecuadorians in the fraud case. The oil company
asked that a jury determine liability claims against Donziger
and his law firm. </p>
<p>The racketeering case is Chevron v. Donziger, 11-cv-00691,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).
The appeals court case is In Re Naranjo, 13-00772, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit (Manhattan). </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the lender
that lost almost $2 billion during Chrysler Group LLC''s 2009
bankruptcy, is now its chief adviser as the automaker''s two
owners haggle over its value. </p>
<p>JPMorgan will advise Chrysler in the event of its sale to
majority shareholder, Fiat SpA, said people with knowledge of
the matter who asked not to be identified because the
information is private. The bank was also listed this week as
the lead underwriter of an initial public offering of Chrysler
shares owned by the company''s other shareholder, a United Auto
Workers retiree trust. </p>
<p>The dual role highlights the complicated path Chrysler has
been forced to take to resolve a dispute between its two
backers. Sergio Marchionne, the chief executive officer of both
Chrysler and Fiat who has spent four years seeking to merge the
companies, is at loggerheads with the UAW''s trust over the value
of its 41.5 percent stake in Chrysler. Letting public investors
put a price on the stake, through the IPO process, is one way to
resolve the matter. </p>
<p>From a banker''s viewpoint, more transactions are
preferred to less, said Jay Ritter, a professor of finance at
the University of Florida. In either an IPO or a merger, the
acquisition of the remaining stake offers opportunities to
collect fees. </p>

<p>Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) won a
tentative court ruling they don''t infringe a patent owned by
SmartMetric Inc., a technology development company that seeks
$13.4 billion in damages. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Michael W. Fitzgerald issued his
tentative ruling yesterday at a hearing in Los Angeles. </p>
<p>I don''t see there''s anything to determine here for a
jury, the judge said at the hearing. </p>
<p>SmartMetric sued Visa and MasterCard two years ago,
claiming they infringed its patent for a system for automatic
connection to a network. The company claimed it was entitled to
a royalty of 25 percent of the anticipated savings Visa and
MasterCard would receive from a drop in credit and debit-card
fraud by the introduction of so-called EMV cards in the U.S. </p>
<p>The EMV cards, which are already used in Europe, include a
microchip instead of a magnetic strip to access a payment
system. The SmartMetric patent pertains to the process by which
the payment system selects a network for a card transaction,
Patrick Bright, the company''s lawyer, said at yesterday''s
hearing. </p>
<p>Bright said he should be allowed to take his evidence
before a jury. </p>
<p>You substituted the court as the trier of fact, Bright
told the judge. That is reversible error. </p>
<p>Joseph Melnik, a lawyer for Visa, said at the hearing that
the Visa and MasterCard systems do fundamentally different
things than what''s claimed by the patent. An earlier lawsuit
brought by SmartMetric against the two companies resulted in a
court ruling that there was no infringement, according to a Visa
court filing. </p>
<p>Fitzgerald didn''t issue a final ruling at the hearing and
took the motion under submission. </p>
<p>In dispute is patent 6,792,464, which was issued in
September 2004. The patent suit was filed in August 2011.  The
case is SmartMetric Inc. (SMME) v. MasterCard International Inc., 11-cv-07126, U.S. District Court, Central District of California

<p>The application also lists flavored and unflavored water;
mineral water; sparkling water; soft drinks; fruit drinks; fruit
juices; sparkling fruit and juice based beverages; soda
beverages; frozen fruit beverages; frozen fruit-based
beverages. </p>
<p>In July Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. (GMCR)''s Keurig unit
filed an application to register a mark it said would be used
with machines for the production of cold water, soda, still,
carbonated and sparkling beverages. </p>
<p>The term Green Mountain is seeking to register is
Karbon. At that same time, Waterbury, Vermont-based Green
Mountain filed a second application to register Bolt for use
with carafes. </p>
<p>One of the selling points for SodaStream''s product is that
it cuts down on waste because customers will be using a
refillable container to make sparking beverages, instead of
buying soda in plastic bottles that need to be recycled. </p>
<h2>SeaWorld Seeks Trademark on Name of Japanese Island, Horse Breed </h2>
<p>SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. (SEAS), the subject of a critical
documentary over the use of killer whales in its theme parks,
may be going in a new direction in efforts to combat an
attendance slump. </p>
<p>The Orlando, Florida-based company filed an application
Sept. 19 to register the term Yonaguni as a trademark,
according to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office database. </p>
<p>The term is to be used for the entertainment services in
the nature of an animated television series for children, the
company said in its application. </p>
<p>The application also covers the use of the term for the
production of live-action and animated entertainment shows and
interactive programs for distribution via audio and visual
media, and electronic means, and for live performances by
costumed characters. </p>
<p>Yonaguni is the name both of a breed of horse found on
Japan''s western islands, and the westernmost inhabited island in
that chain. There is also a stone formation beneath the sea near
that island that is known as the Yonaguni Monument, and is
believed by some to be a sunken man-made structure. </p>
<p>SeaWorld received negative publicity from Blackfish,
released in U.S. theaters on July 19, which began attracting
attention after its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in
January. </p>
<p>Blackfish argues that killer whales shouldn''t be held
in captivity, and that the company ignored warning signs of the
danger to handlers. SeaWorld has countered with a detailed
critique of the film, calling it a dishonest movie in a
statement distributed to critics and refuting many of its
conclusions. </p>
<p>There is no higher priority for SeaWorld than the safety
of guests and staff and the welfare of our animals, the
company said in a statement following the release of the film. </p>
<h2>Pho Holdings Backs Down in Trademark Claim Against Mo Pho </h2>
<p>A Vietnamese restaurant in South London received a cease-and-desist letter from a restaurant chain accusing it of
infringing a pho trademark, the U.K.''s Guardian newspaper
reported. </p>
<p>Pho is Vietnam''s national dish and a staple at Vietnamese
restaurants, according to the Guardian. </p>
<p>Pho Holdings Ltd., which sent the notice to the Mo Pho
restaurant, said it had registered the mark six years earlier
and no one else was entitled to use the word in a restaurant
name, the newspaper reported. </p>
<p>The company has since changed course, saying it had made a
mistake, wouldn''t file a trademark infringement suit and hadn''t
meant to suggest that the trademark conveyed ownership of pho,
according to the Guardian. </p>
<h2>Diamond Resorts Claims Diamond Resort Marketing Infringes Marks </h2>
<p>Diamond Resorts International Inc., the Las Vegas-based
time-share vacation-property operator, sued a Virginia company
that offers time-share marking services for trademark
infringement. </p>
<p>Diamond Resort Marketing Services Inc. of Alexandria,
Virginia, is accused of confusing the public by using marks that
are similar to those belonging to the Las Vegas company. </p>
<p>According to the complaint filed Sept. 24 in federal court
in Newark, New Jersey, Diamond Resort Marketing also used an
Internet domain name -- www.diamondresortms.com -- that is also
causes the public to assume falsely that the two entities are
affiliated. </p>
<p>Diamond Resort Marketing allegedly uses similar names to
trade on the goodwill established by the Las Vegas company,
according to the complaint. </p>
<p>Diamond Resorts International asked the court for an order
barring further use of the confusingly similar names, and asked
that it be transferred the objectionable domain name. </p>
<p>Additionally, the company seeks money damages of at least
$2 million per infringed trademark, and asked that they be
tripled to punish the Virginia company for its actions, and for
awards of litigation costs and attorney fees. </p>
<p>The suit also names Diamond Resort Marketing''s Web-hosting
service and a privacy protection service that replaces visible
contact information for a domain name with alternative
information, concealing the identity of the true owner of the
domain. </p>
<p>Diamond Resort Marketing didn''t respond to an e-mailed
request for comment. </p>
<p>The case is Diamond Resorts Holdings LLC v. Host Department
LLC, 2:13-cv-05689-SDW-MCA, U.S. District Court, District of New
Jersey (Newark). </p>

<h2>Bollywood-Style Weddings Need Copyright Protection, Planners Say </h2>
<p>India''s wedding industry, which is growing 25 percent a
year, is in need of copyright protection, according to a meeting
of wedding planners, Asian Age reported. </p>
<p>At the Copyright of Wedding conference, held in
Guragon, India, wedding planners said the growing demand for
Bollywood-style wedding film videos means months of costly
preparation, and many planners say their ideas have been ripped
off and credited to others often within less than a week,
according to Asian Age. </p>
<p>Michael Menezes of the Showtime Group wedding organizers
told the conference that protecting his work is difficult
because intellectual property rights presently don''t exist in
the field, the newspaper reported. </p>
<p>At the conference attorney Umesh Sharma said when someone
is accused of infringement in this category, offenders often
manage to walk out of court with no more than a warning,

equipment under claims the competitor stole its trade secrets,
the China Post reported. </p>
<p>Ability Opto-Electronics Technology Co. (3362) is accused of

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) will extend
benefits to same-sex spouses of U.S. employees after federal
government agencies altered the definition of marriage, marking
the conversion of one of the last major corporate holdouts on
the issue. </p>
<p>Exxon''s decision follows a June ruling by the U.S. Supreme
Court that struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act,
spurring changes by the Internal Revenue Service and other
agencies on what constitutes legal marriages, Alan Jeffers, a
spokesman for the Irving, Texas-based company, said in a phone
interview yesterday. </p>
<p>Advocates of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender
community, known as LGBT, heralded the move as a victory. </p>
<p>Exxon''s announcement shows the tide is continuing to turn
in corporate America, said New York State Comptroller Thomas
DiNapoli, who for the past four years has failed to win approval
of shareholder resolutions it sponsored urging Exxon to take
this step. This is a very positive step for the LGBT community
and a vindication of years of efforts by shareholders and
activists across the country. </p>
<p>Exxon has long based its employee benefits programs on the
government''s definition of marriage in nations where it
operates. Accordingly, Exxon adapted its rules to the recent
changes in the U.S., Jeffers said. The company already provided
benefits to same-sex spouses in 30 other countries where local
laws allow for the marriages, he said. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Citigroup
Inc. (C) were among the banks that lost a bid to throw out a Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. lawsuit over $388 million in securities
sold to a failed lender. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Louis Stanton in Manhattan today denied
a motion to dismiss the suit, which also targets UBS AG (UBSN),
Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) Stanton rejected defense
arguments that FDIC filed the suit too late and that the agency
failed to make a sufficient claim that could allow it to
recover. </p>
<p>In the suit, filed last year, FDIC alleged that the banks
misrepresented the quality of the loans underlying 11
residential mortgage-backed securities that Colonial Bank
purchased in 2007. </p>
<p>Colonial Bank, of Montgomery, Alabama, was closed by the
Alabama State Banking Department on Aug. 14, 2009, and the FDIC
was named as a receiver for the institution. </p>
<p>The misrepresentations included inaccurate loan-to-value
ratios based on inflated property values, according to the
complaint. Many of the properties at issue also had second
mortgages that weren''t disclosed, the FDIC said. </p>
<p>In many cases, the amount of the undisclosed additional
liens was much greater than the owners'' ostensible equity,
putting the owner ''under water'' on the day on which this
securitization closed, the FDIC said in the complaint. </p>
<p>The case is Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. as receiver for
Colonial Bank v. Chase Mortgage Finance Corp, 12-cv-6166, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is part of
a group that''s close to buying a stake in Dong Energy A/S,
Denmark''s largest utility, a person involved in the transaction
said. </p>
<p>The group, which includes a unit of New York-based Goldman
and Danish pension funds ATP and PFA, will pay more than 8
billion kroner ($1.5 billion) for a stake that''s greater than 20
percent, said the person, who asked not to be identified because
the talks are private. Danish newspaper Borsen reported earlier
today that Goldman and the two funds are seeking a stake,
without saying how it obtained the information. </p>
<p>Denmark''s government said in February it will sell a stake
in the Skaerbaek, Denmark-based utility which is restructuring
after losing money on failed natural gas bets. Goldman would be
the lead buyer taking a greater stake than the pension funds,
the person said. </p>
<p>Goldman wouldn''t say if the bank is seeking to buy a stake
in Dong, according to an e-mail from Joanna Carss, a London-based spokeswoman. </p>
<p>The parties are still negotiating terms for how they would
exit the investment, the person said. The buyers want a clause
allowing them to sell their stake to the government or a
timetable for an initial public offering of Dong shares, the
person said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan
Stanley (MS) had their earnings estimates lowered by Brad Hintz, a
Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. analyst, amid a decline in trading he
called a full-scale rout. </p>
<p>Hintz cut Goldman Sachs''s third-quarter per-share earnings
estimate by 15 percent to $2.62 and the full-year estimate by
8.6 percent to $15.59 per share, according to a note today about
the two New York-based banks. Morgan Stanley''s per-share third-quarter estimate was decreased 20 percent to 41 cents, and the
2013 figure dropped 4.8 percent to $1.98. </p>
<p>While the third quarter is typically seasonally soft, Q3
2013 appears to be turning into a full-scale rout in trading as
weak activity and limited risk-taking constrained performance,
Hintz wrote. Fixed-income trading volume could decline 20
percent to 25 percent on average in the three months ended Sept.
30, he wrote. </p>
<p>Analysts have been reducing their third-quarter earnings
estimates for the biggest U.S. banks. JPMorgan Chase  Co., the
nation''s largest lender, said trading revenue will probably fall
this period and Jefferies Group LLC said revenue from fixed-income trading plunged 88 percent in its fiscal third quarter,
which ended Aug. 31, compared with a year earlier. </p>
<p>Marty Mosby, an analyst for Guggenheim Securities LLC,
downgraded shares of Goldman Sachs and Bank of America Corp.,
the second-biggest U.S. bank, to neutral from buy as revenue
from capital-markets and mortgage banking declines, according to
a note today. </p>
<p>Fixed-income trading revenue at the biggest U.S. banks will
probably fall 20 percent in the third quarter from a year
earlier amid lower volume, Richard Staite, an analyst at
Atlantic Equities LLP, said in a note this week. That led him to
cut his estimate for Goldman Sachs''s per-share third-quarter
earnings by 18 percent and Morgan Stanley''s by 25 percent. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s (JPM) negotiations
with federal and state authorities to resolve a series of
investigations tied to mortgage bonds are focusing on a
potential $11 billion figure, including $4 billion for consumer
relief, a person familiar with the talks said. </p>
<p>The amount isn''t final, said the person, who asked not to
be identified because the negotiations aren''t public. Those
involved in the talks include the U.S. Justice Department, the
Department of Housing and Urban Development and New York
Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is co-chairman of a
federal and state working group on residential mortgage-backed
securities. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon arrived at the
Justice Department in Washington yesterday to personally discuss
the settlement with Attorney General Eric Holder, according to a
person familiar with the meeting. Federal officials rejected a
proposalfrom the bank earlier this week to pay between $3
billion and $4 billion to settle the probes, a separate person
with knowledge of the negotiations said. </p>
<p>The talks are still fluid and the size of the settlement
keeps changing, according to another person familiar with the
matter. The people said they weren''t sure which claims may be
resolved. The bank is trying to resolve as many probes as
possible before the end of the third quarter on Sept. 30,
according to people familiar with the bank''s thinking. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is seeking to negotiate a resolution to mortgage-bond investigations being conducted by federal and state
authorities, including probes by U.S. attorneys in Philadelphia,
Washington and Sacramento, California, according to another
person briefed on the effort. </p>
<p>The bank has also tried to settle a $6 billion claim by the
Federal Housing Finance Agency, according to the person, who
also asked not to be identified because the talks are private. </p>
<p>Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for the New York-based bank,
declined to comment on the negotiations. </p>
<p>Talks are ongoing, Lauren Horwood, a spokeswoman for
Sacramento U.S. Attorney Ben Wagner, one of the federal
officials involved in the talks, said Sept. 25. </p>

<h2>Compliance Policy </h2>
<h2>Germany Rejects Plan for $68 Billion Fund to Aid Non-Euro Banks </h2>
<p>Germany rejected a European Commission proposal to turn a
50 billion-euro ($68 billion) rescue fund into a bank backstop
for member states outside the single-currency bloc. </p>
<p>The European Union''s balance-of-payments fund currently has
about 40 billion euros available, after being used to help
Latvia, Hungary and Romania. The commission, the EU''s executive
arm, now wants to overhaul the fund and add a tool for bank aid
that could be tapped by non-euro countries whose lenders fail
next year''s continent-wide stress tests. </p>
<p>The German government and those of five other EU member
states, including non-euro countries, reject the plan, which
isn''t needed to maintain financial stability, a German Finance
Ministry official said by telephone yesterday on customary
condition of anonymity. </p>
<p>The Brussels-based commission wants a resource that can
operate alongside the euro area''s 500 billion-euro firewall, the
European Stability Mechanism, so that the entire 28-nation EU is
braced for the results of next year''s stress tests. The goal is
to reach a deal by the end of this year so that the tool can be
ready by mid-2014, when the commission also hopes to have
finished negotiations on when the firewall can provide direct
aid to euro-zone banks. </p>
<p>The European Central Bank will be conducting balance-sheet
reviews of major banks across the euro area as it prepares to
take on new oversight duties in the second half of 2014. If all
the proposed backstops are in place, the EU would have as much
as 400 billion euros available to handle any banking problems
that emerge. </p>
<h2>China May Allow Non-Financials to Set Up Consumer Finance Units </h2>
<p>The China Banking Regulatory Commission plans to allow non-financial companies to set up consumer finance companies, the
regulator said in a statement on its website yesterday, citing
revised draft rules and seeking public opinion. </p>
<p>Non-financial companies will require experienced strategic
investors to meet regulatory requirements, according to the
statement. The minimum stake requirement for major shareholders
will be lowered to 30 percent from the current 50 percent, the
commission said in the statement. </p>
<p>Consumer finance companies will be allowed to accept
deposits from their shareholders in China, according to the
statement. </p>
<h2>Danish Regulator Cracks Down on Mortgage Banks as Risks Grow </h2>
<p>Denmark''s financial regulator is preparing a set of
guidelines due to be unveiled next year to stop mortgage banks
falling deeper into a funding mismatch spawned by reliance on
short-term borrowing. </p>
<p>The Financial Supervisory Authority, criticized in a
government-commissioned report last week for failing to curb
risk-taking in the years leading into the financial crisis,
plans to set limits on issuance of bonds backing interest-only
and adjustable-rate mortgages in the $500 billion market,
Director General Ulrik Noedgaard said. </p>
<p>A government-appointed committee investigating the causes
behind Denmark''s housing and banking crises said last week
regulators should have done more to prevent an explosion in
lending. More than one-third of the country''s commercial banks
have closed since a property bubble burst in 2008, according to
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. </p>
<p>The FSA''s standards will be based on recommendations from
the crisis committee, Noedgaard said. The clampdown on lending
follows warnings from Moody''s Investors Service, Standard 
Poor''s and the central bank that a shift away from 30-year,
fixed-rate mortgages during the past decade is threatening
Denmark''s financial stability. </p>
<h2>Compliance Action </h2>
<h2>Mizuho Penalized for Transactions With Anti-Social'' Groups </h2>
<p>Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411)''s lending unit was penalized by
Japan''s banking regulator for failing to take steps to end more
than two years of transactions with anti-social groups. </p>
<p>Mizuho Bank Ltd. was ordered to strengthen legal compliance
and administrative controls, the Financial Services Agency said
in a statement in Tokyo today. The unit of Japan''s third-biggest
bank by market value made loans to the anti-social groups, the
FSA said, without identifying them. The phrase is often used in
Japan to describe criminal organizations. </p>
<p>Japanese authorities have stepped up efforts to combat
yakuza gangs, whose activities range from extortion to fraud and
money laundering, according to the National Police Agency. In
the first penalty of its kind against a Japanese bank since
2007, the FSA told Mizuho to make a clean break from the
groups after conducting 230 transactions, mostly car loans. </p>
<p>Mizuho made transactions valued at about 200 million yen
($2 million), an FSA official said at a news briefing in Tokyo,
asking not to be named in accordance with the agency''s policy. </p>
<p>The bank has to formulate measures to prevent a recurrence
and submit a business improvement plan by Oct. 28, the regulator
said. It will report on its progress at the end of November and
December and then every three months. </p>
<p>Mizuho takes this order very seriously and deeply regrets
these occurrences, the bank said in a statement. The Tokyo-based company hasn''t decided any internal penalties yet,
spokeswoman Masako Shiono said by phone. </p>
<p>Today''s action is the latest blow to Mizuho after the FSA
punished the bank for a computer glitch that delayed
transactions following the nation''s March 2011 earthquake. </p>
<h2>Rabobank Said to Be Close to Libor Probe Settlement Next Month </h2>
<p>Rabobank Groep may reach a settlement with regulators as
soon as next month over claims the Dutch bank tried to
manipulate benchmark interest rates, a person with knowledge of
the matter said. </p>
<p>Rabobank, the Netherlands'' biggest mortgage lender, is
likely to pay a fine higher than the 290 million pounds ($466
million) levied on Barclays Plc (BARC) in June 2012 and lower than the
$612 million paid by Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, though it
may be negotiated even below the Barclays fine, said the person,
who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. </p>
<p>Rabobank, the only Dutch contributor to the London
interbank offered rate, has had talks since at least 2011 with
regulators including the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, the Justice Department and the U.K. Financial
Services Authority. </p>
<p>Europe''s biggest agricultural lender is next in line to
settle probes into Libor. The settlement''s timing was reported
earlier by the Financial Times. </p>
<p>Hendrik Jan Eijpe, a spokesman for the Utrecht-based
lender, said the company is cooperating with the investigations
and declined to comment on the status of the probes. Rabobank in
August said it took a provision to settle probes into Libor,
without elaborating the size of the charge. </p>
<p>The lender previously said it received Libor-and Euribor-related subpoenas and information requests in nations including
the Netherlands, U.K., U.S. and Japan. </p>
<p>China''s Capital Rules Compliant With Basel III, Basel Group Says </p>
<p>China''s implementation of the Basel capital framework was
found to be closely aligned with the Basel III global
standards, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision said. </p>
<p>Some differences with the Basel framework were found,
the Basel group said in statement on its website. </p>
<p>None of the findings were judged to be material at this
point, the group said. China''s response to the report
expresses the strong commitment of the Chinese authorities to
implement the global regulatory reforms, the Basel group said. </p>
<h2>Courts/Tribunals </h2>
<h2>GM Suppliers in Japan Plead Guilty in $5 Billion Cartel Case </h2>
<p>Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503), Hitachi Automotive Systems Ltd. (6501)
and seven other Japanese companies agreed to plead guilty and
pay a total of $740 million in fines for a price-fixing
conspiracy targeting automakers that included General Motors Co. (GM)
and Ford Motor Co. (F) </p>
<p>Chrysler Group LLC and Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) were also among
car companies operating in the U.S. that faced inflated costs on
more than $5 billion of parts, affecting prices on at least 25
million vehicles, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in a
news conference yesterday in Washington. </p>
<p>The announcement brings criminal fines in the Justice
Department''s continuing probe of price fixing in the auto-parts
industry to more than $1.6 billion and the number of companies
and individuals charged to 20 and 21 respectively, the Justice
Department said in a statement. </p>
<p>Seventeen of the 21 executives have been sentenced to jail
in the U.S. or have entered into plea agreements calling for
significant prison sentences, Holder said. Two of them were
charged yesterday. </p>
<p>Scott Hammond, a deputy assistant attorney general who
worked on the investigation said there are more than a dozen
separate conspiracies operating independently, that all target
U.S. automotive manufacturers. </p>
<p>The plea agreements must be accepted by a federal judge to
become final. </p>
<p>The Mitsubishi Heavy case is U.S. v. Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries Ltd. (7011), 2:13-cr-20711, U.S. District Court, District of
Columbia (Washington). </p>

<h2>Ex-RBS Trader Fired Over Libor-Rigging Sues for Unfair Dismissal </h2>
<p>A former Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc trader sued the
lender over his firing for alleged misconduct related to
manipulation of benchmark interest rates. </p>
<p>Simon Green, who traded derivatives tied to short-term
moves in interest rates in dollars and euros, filed an unfair
dismissal suit, according to documents from a London employment
tribunal. He was let go in March, weeks after the Edinburgh-based bank paid $612 million to settle with regulators probing
its attempts to rig the London interbank offered rate. </p>
<p>Claims that traders tried to influence Libor, the benchmark
for $300 trillion of contracts worldwide, led to criminal probes
and regulatory fines for Barclays Plc, UBS AG (UBSN), RBS and broker
ICAP Plc. (IAP) RBS has fired seven employees for misconduct related
to Libor, a person familiar with the matter said in April. </p>
<p>Sarah Small, an RBS spokeswoman, declined to comment. The
bank has said it will claw back bonuses from those involved to
help pay any fines. </p>
<p>Green''s lawyer, Layla Bunni, said she couldn''t immediately
comment when reached by phone at her office in London. Copies of
the employment complaint aren''t publicly available. </p>
<p>Green may argue he was singled out unfairly, or that the
bank knew about his actions and did nothing until regulators
intervened, according to employment lawyer Jo Keddie, who isn''t
involved in the case. </p>
<h2>Ex-ChinaCast Chairman Sued by SEC Over Claims He Stole Millions </h2>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused the
former chairman and chief executive officer of ChinaCast
Education Corp. (CAST) of stealing tens of millions of dollars from
investors in a U.S. public offering. </p>
<p>Chan Tze Ngon, 57, transferred $41 million out of the $43.8
million raised from investors to a purported subsidiary in which
he secretly held a controlling 50 percent stake, the SEC said in
a statement. Chan also secretly pledged $30.4 million of
ChinaCast''s cash deposits to secure the debts of entities
unrelated to the company, according to the agency. </p>
<p>The SEC also sued Jiang Xiangyuan, ChinaCast''s former
president for operations in China, over claims he avoided more
than $200,000 in losses by illegally selling shares in the
company on confidential information. </p>
<p>ChinaCast entered U.S. capital markets in 2006 through a
reverse merger, in which a closely held firm buys a shell
company already on an exchange in order to list shares without a
public offering, the SEC said. </p>
<p>The Hong Kong-based company had a market capitalization of
more than $200 million before the alleged frauds came to light,
the SEC said. </p>
<p>Chan and Jiang, who live in China, have no known defense
counsel, the SEC said. </p>

<h2>SEC''s White Says Investigators Will Focus Cases on Individuals </h2>
<p>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Jo
White said her agency will focus on bringing more cases against
individuals who violate securities laws rather than the
companies where they work. </p>
<p>I want to be sure we are looking first at the individual
conduct and working out to the entity, rather than starting with
the entity as a whole and working in, White said in remarks
prepared for delivery at a Council of Institutional Investors
conference in Chicago yesterday. It is a subtle shift, but one
that could bring more individuals into enforcement cases. </p>
<p>SEC investigators will also seek more mandatory compliance
measures in settlements to prevent future misconduct and not
just punish past wrongdoing, she said. </p>
<p>Redress for wrongdoing must never be seen as a cost of
doing business made good by cutting a corporate check, White
said. </p>

<p>Sales of structured notes tied to
the creditworthiness of banks in the euro region''s periphery are
the highest in six months as investors gain confidence lenders
will benefit from the region''s improving economy. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) led issuance
of $42.3 million of the securities in September, the most since
$167.2 million in March, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The notes are tied to the debt of lenders including
Spain''s Banco Popular Espanol SA (POP), Banco BPI SA of Portugal and
UniCredit SpA. </p>
<p>The euro area''s economy emerged from its longest-ever
recession in the second quarter and European Central Bank
President Mario Draghi said this week he''s ready to use another
longer-term refinancing operation if needed to curb market
rates. Bank credit risk is improving, with investors demanding
102 basis points of extra yield to hold their debt instead of
government bonds, down from 179 a year earlier, according to
Bloomberg bond index data. </p>
<p>Peripheral banks have been beaten up over the past few
years, but there is growing investor comfort with them and more
willingness to take on that exposure, especially in Spain where
the restructuring of balance sheets has been extensive and
visible, said Steve Hussey, head of financial institutions
credit research at AllianceBernstein Ltd. in London. </p>
<h2>Spanish Lenders </h2>
<p>Spanish banks took more than 200 billion euros ($270.6
billion) of impairments between June 2008 and December 2012 amid
the collapse of a decade-long property boom that sent home
prices plunging and burdened banks with more bad loans,
according to Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA. The country''s
lenders, which have received 129 billion euros of capital
injections since the end of 2007, are in a strong position to
pass an ECB asset quality review next year, BBVA''s chief
financial officer Manuel Gonzalez Cid, said Sept. 25. </p>
<p>JPMorgan issued the first credit-linked notes tied to
Portugal''s Banco BPI since at least 1999, Bloomberg data show.
The largest U.S. bank by assets raised $19.8 million from two
offerings that pay 4.7 percentage points and 4.8 percentage
points more than the three-month euro interbank offered rate. </p>
<p>Nomura sold $5.5 million of 15-year callable notes tied to
UniCredit, Italy''s largest bank, with coupons of 9.1 percent
this month, as well as 2.28 million euros of 5.26 percent
securities linked to Banco Popolare SC. Italian banks'' gross
non-performing loans as a proportion of total lending rose to
7.2 percent in July from 5.7 percent a year earlier, according
to the Italian Banking Association ABI. </p>
<p>Craig MacDonald, a spokesman for JPMorgan in London,
declined to comment on the notes, while Nomura spokesman Rob
Davies was unable to comment immediately. </p>
<p>Interest in peripheral banks is emblematic of the risk-on
environment, with investors looking to take advantage of wider
credit spreads on offer in countries like Spain and Italy said
Michael Symonds, a credit analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets in
London. </p>

<p>U.K. tax officials may have to pay
out 1 billion pounds ($1.62 billion) to about 100 investment
funds -- including some run by JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc -- suing for the return of overpaid
taxes dating back two decades. </p>
<p>Her Majesty''s Revenue  Customs won''t disclose what it may
owe the funds in lawsuits stemming from a 2007 European Court
ruling that investment trusts were improperly charged value-added tax on management fees. Marc Welby, a partner at
accounting firm BDO LLP estimated the agency might have to
refund about 1 billion pounds. </p>
<p>The litigation is about investment trusts who feel short-changed over the way in which HMRC handled claims, said Welby,
a London tax specialist who isn''t involved in the dispute. </p>
<p>U.K. lawmakers have publicly censured companies including
Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) and Apple Inc. (AAPL) for using legal loopholes to
minimize taxes. At the same time, the agency in charge of
collecting them is fighting in the courts to avoid refunds that
could cost the government billions of pounds. </p>
<p>About 120 investment trusts, including others operated by
BlackRock Inc. (BLK), Schroders Plc (SDR) and Investec Plc, have sued HMRC
since May 2012, according to court filings that didn''t show the
reason for the suits. Two people familiar with the actions said
at least 100 of them are related to overpaid VAT. </p>

<p>Pfizer''s Inc. (PFE)''s Premarin for
menopause may be tied to a higher risk of blood clots than
another common estrogen treatment called estradiol, a study
found. </p>
<p>Women taking Premarin, also known as conjugated equine
estrogens, had double the risk of a blood clot in the veins than
women taking estradiol, a synthetic form of estrogen, according
to research today in JAMA Internal Medicine. No difference
between the treatments was seen in the risk of stroke. </p>
<p>Today''s findings don''t mean women should stop taking
Premarin, an estrogen gathered from the urine of pregnant
horses, to ease their menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes,
night sweats, mood swings and vaginal dryness, said Nicholas
Smith, the lead study author. More research is needed to
replicate the results so doctors can say for sure that different
types of estrogen drugs carry varied levels of heart risks, he
said. </p>
<p>The assumption has held that all oral estrogens have
similar safety profiles. This may not be the case, Smith, a
professor of epidemiology at the University of Washington School
of Public Health in Seattle, said in an e-mail. More
comparative safety studies of commonly used treatments are
needed. </p>
<p>Researchers in the study included 384 post-menopausal women
ages 30 to 79 who were taking hormone treatments and were part
of the heart and vascular health study with Group Health
Cooperative, a health-care system in Washington state. </p>
<h2>Study Findings </h2>
<p>From January 2003 to December 2009, 68 women developed
blood clots, including 39 who used Premarin, 67 had a heart
attack, including 38 who used Premarin, and 48 had a stroke,
including 25 who used Premarin. Those women were matched with
201 patients who didn''t have any heart events and were current
estrogen users. </p>
<p>While the research showed the risk of having a heart attack
for Premarin users was higher than those taking estradiol, the
findings weren''t statistically significant. </p>
<p>Pfizer strongly believes in the use of conjugated
estrogens as a treatment option for women who have moderate to
severe menopausal symptoms, Jennifer Kokell, a company
spokeswoman, said in a statement. Premarin generated $1.07
billion in sales last year. </p>
<p>Conjugated estrogens have been used for over 70 years as
an effective treatment option for women experiencing menopausal
symptoms, Kokell said. Pfizer remains committed to helping
meet the needs of women going through menopause. </p>
<p>Women should use hormones at the lowest dose for the
shortest amount of time, according to U.S. recommendations. </p>
<h2>Health Risks </h2>
<p>More than 6 million women took New York-based Pfizer''s
Premarin and Prempro, a combination of estrogen and progestin,
to treat their menopausal symptoms before they were linked in
2002 to health concerns such as breast cancer. </p>
<p>The Women''s Health Initiative, a U.S.-sponsored study of
disease and disability in postmenopausal women, was halted in
2002 after finding that women who took Pfizer''s Prempro had a
higher breast-cancer risk. That led to a decline in sales of
hormone replacement therapy pills. The Women''s Health Initiative
Estrogen-Alone Trial was stopped in 2004, a year earlier than
planned, because of an increased risk of stroke. </p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration says that women shouldn''t
use hormone therapy to prevent heart attacks and strokes or
memory loss and Alzheimer''s disease. Studies also haven''t shown
the treatments prevent aging and wrinkles or increase sex drive,
the agency said. </p>
<p>Hormone treatments may help relieve menopausal symptoms and
reduce a woman''s chance of getting osteoporosis, according to
the FDA. Still the drugs may raise the chance a woman gets blood
clots, heart attacks, strokes, breast cancer and gall bladder
disease. Women who have a uterus and take estrogen may have a
higher risk of cancer of the uterine lining, the FDA said. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) bought Forties
crude for the first time in more than 19 months. Vitol Group
withdrew the only offer for Russian Urals in northwest Europe. </p>
<p>Libya''s state-run National Oil Corp. maintained the
official selling price for benchmark Es Sider crude for October
at 30 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent, according to a price
list obtained by Bloomberg News. </p>
<h2>North Sea </h2>
<p>Vitol sold Forties cargo F1008 for Oct. 14 to Oct. 16
loading to Exxon at parity to Dated Brent, according to a
Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
pricing window. Exxon last bought a Forties lot in the window on
Feb. 7, 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Today''s trade was
15 cents to 35 cents more than deals on Sept. 24. </p>
<p>Total SA failed to buy Oct. 20 to Oct. 25 Forties at a 30
cent premium to Dated Brent, according to the survey. </p>
<p>Brent for November settlement traded at $107.79 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $109.38 from the previous session. The December
contract was at $106.82, a discount of 97 cents to November. </p>
<p>The share of Buzzard crude in the Forties blend fell to 45
percent in the week ending Sept. 29, down from 46 percent a week
earlier, according to data posted on BP''s website. </p>
<h2>Urals/Mediterranean </h2>
<p>Vitol withdrew an offer to sell 100,000 metric tons of
Urals crude at $1.60 a barrel less than Dated Brent for loading
at the Baltic ports of Primorsk or Ust-Luga Oct. 11 to Oct. 15,
the survey showed. The Russian crude last traded on Sept. 26 at
discounts of $2 and $1.90 to the benchmark. </p>
<p>OAO Surgutneftegas sold three Urals cargoes for loading in
October in a tender. The company sold a shipment loading from
Primorsk on Oct. 12 to Oct. 13 and another from Ust-Luga on Oct.
13 to Oct. 14 to Glencore Xstrata Plc, according to four people
who participate in the market, asking not to be identified
because the information is confidential. The third lot was
bought by OAO Lukoil for Oct. 18 to Oct. 19 loading from Ust-Luga, the people said. The cargoes traded at discounts of $1.75
to $2 a barrel to Dated Brent. </p>
<p>Surgut also issued a tender for two Urals cargoes loading
at Primorsk on Oct. 20 to Oct. 21 and Oct. 23 to Oct. 24 and a
third consignment from Ust-Luga on Oct. 22 to Oct. 23. That
tender closes tomorrow. </p>
<p>PKN Orlen bought 100,000 tons of Urals for delivery to the
Butinge oil terminal in Lithuania, according to three people who
participate in the market, who also asked not to be identified
because the information is confidential. </p>
<p>Prices for all Libyan grades, except Al-Jurf and Bouri, are
unchanged from this month, a price list obtained by Bloomberg
News showed. </p>
<p>Libya''s oil production exceeded 700,000 barrels a day,
almost 45 percent of installed capacity, on higher output from
the western region, Oil Ministry Measurement Director Ibrahim Al Awami yesterday. </p>
<p>Protesters from the Amazigh community yesterday closed the
pipeline supplying the Mellitah terminal in western Libya with
oil from the Eni SpA-operated Wafa field, Mohamad Al-Ansari, the
oil ministry''s media executive, said today from Tripoli. </p>
<h2>West Africa </h2>
<p>BP Plc offered 600,000 barrels of Qua Iboe at either $5.50
a barrel more than Dated Brent for Oct. 10 to Oct. 15 delivery
to Rotterdam, or plus $5.35 to Lavera in France on the Dilong
Spirit crude carrier, according to the survey. This is unchanged
from its previous offer on Sept. 23. </p>
<p>Indian Oil Corp booked the Caesar supertanker to ship crude
from West Africa on Oct. 26 to India''s west coast, according to
three tanker reports including one from Marex Spectron Group.
The company bought 1 million barrels each of Nigerian Agbami and
Angolan Kissanje crudes for October loading from BP via a tender
in early August. </p>
<p>The Indian company''s third tender for crude loading in
November will close Oct. 3, with offers valid until the
following day, according to a document obtained by Bloomberg
News. </p>
<p>Japan imported 313,842 kiloliters, or 1.97 million barrels
of crude from Africa in August, compared with 616,187 barrels in
July, according to data from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and
Industry. </p>

<p>Visa Inc. (V), MasterCard Inc. (MA) and
American Express Co. (AXP), the biggest U.S. payment networks,
proposed using digital tokens instead of account numbers for
processing purchases made online and with mobile devices. </p>
<p>Tokens provide an additional layer of security and
eliminate the need for merchants, digital wallet operators or
others to store account numbers, the companies said today in a
joint statement. </p>
<p>The standard, to be applied worldwide, will be presented to
other payment firms and industry trade groups in coming weeks,
according to the statement. Tokens would be the digital
equivalent of magnetic stripes on the back of plastic bank cards
that contain customer information. They also may help to reduce
fraud by providing uniformity as companies such as Google Inc.
and Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) embrace mobile commerce and offer consumers
new ways to pay. </p>
<p>Mobile is the future, Jim McCarthy, global head of
innovation and strategic partnerships at Foster City,
California-based Visa, said during the conference call. We
haven''t evolved to create a standard. For the first time, we are
laying down the foundation. </p>
<p>Global card fraud losses for banks, merchants and
processors climbed 15 percent last year to $11.3 billion from
2011, according to the Nilson Report, a payments industry
newsletter based in Carpinteria, California. Gross fraud losses
in 2012 increased to 5.22 cents for every $100 in volume from
5.07 cents a year earlier. </p>
<h2>EMV-Chip </h2>
<p>Tokens also would complement so-called EMV-chip technology,
which has become a standard in Europe and much of the rest of
the world. </p>
<p>The U.S. is among the last developed nations whose payment
system relies primarily on cards with magnetic stripes and
hasn''t yet adopted EMV. Standards for the technology are managed
by EMVCo, which was formed in 1999 by Europay International,
Visa and Purchase, New York-based MasterCard. New York-based
AmEx is also an EMVCo member. </p>
<p>As merchants worldwide deploy more EMV terminals, fraud is
moving toward transactions conducted online or over the
telephone where physical payment cards aren''t present, according
to an August issue of the Nilson Report. </p>
<p>The U.S. has high fraud losses because it leads the world
in online sales, according to the trade publication. Smaller
merchants who do not invest in fraud-fighting tools are
particularly vulnerable. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS)''s contract renewal
talks with Dish Network Corp. (DISH) are hung up on Dish''s ad-skipping
technology and terms for two new Disney cable channels,
according to people familiar with the discussions. </p>
<p>Dish, the second-largest U.S. satellite-TV service, and
Disney, owner of ABC, ESPN and Disney Channel, gave themselves
one to two days beyond yesterday''s deadline to hammer out an
accord, said the people, who sought anonymity because the
discussions are private. Talks may last longer, they said. </p>
<p>Dish''s AutoHop technology, introduced in May 2012, presents
a obstacle to a deal. The one-button feature allows subscribers
to skip commercials on recorded broadcast TV shows, undermining
the effectiveness of network ads. Dish is embroiled in
litigation with ABC, CBS Corp. (CBS), Comcast Corp.''s NBC and 21st
Century Fox Inc.''s Fox over the feature. </p>
<p>Disney, based in Burbank, California, is also trying to
build distribution for two new channels -- Fusion, a venture
with Univision Communications Inc. aimed at Hispanics, and the
SEC Network, which will feature Southeastern Conference college
sports beginning next year. Terms for both are being negotiated,
the people said. </p>
<p>Dish, based in Englewood, Colorado, and Disney said
yesterday they agreed to a short-term extension of their
agreement, which was due to expire Sept. 30. The deal prevented
a blackout of ESPN and the Disney Channel for Dish subscribers,
including ABC viewers in markets where Disney owns the stations,
such as New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. </p>

<p>The purchase will give New York-based Goldman a 19 percent

<p>Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc.
strategists are maintaining their view that the dollar will
appreciate next year, despite recent weakness, as the U.S.
recovery accelerates and the Federal Reserve curbs stimulus. </p>
<p>Dollar strength is going to develop next year, based on
the growth story, Ian Stannard, Morgan Stanley''s head of
European foreign-exchange strategy, told the Bloomberg FX13
summit in London today. The advance will be driven by relative
monetary policy and relative investment flows, he said. </p>
<p>The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index has fallen more than 1
percent since Sept. 17, the day before the Fed said it would
keep printing cash to buy $85 billion of bonds a month because
it had yet to see signs of sustained economic growth. The index
had strengthened 5.5 percent in the first six months of the year
as investors bet that an improving outlook would prompt the
central bank to scale back stimulus. </p>
<p>The Fed may have just delayed the inevitable, Valentin Marinov, head of Group of 10 foreign-exchange strategy at
Citigroup Inc. in London, said at the event. We could be on
the verge of the next dollar bull run. </p>
<p>After the Fed refrained from reducing its monthly asset
purchases at last month''s meeting, Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said
the central bank would decide on whether to taper purchases
based on what''s needed for the economy. The Fed signaled
that day it needs to see more signs of sustained labor market
gains before slowing the pace of purchases. </p>
<h2>Taper Speculation </h2>
<p>Companies added fewer workers than projected in September,
indicating the U.S. job market is struggling to gain momentum, a
private report based on payrolls showed today. The 166,000
increase in employment followed a revised 159,000 gain in August
that was smaller than initially estimated, according to the ADP
Research Institute in Roseland, New Jersey. The median forecast
of economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 180,000 advance. </p>
<p>Speculation on when the Fed will start to withdraw stimulus
is the biggest driver of foreign-exchange markets after the
decision to press on with bond purchases weakened the dollar and
boosted emerging-market currencies, Citigroup''s Marinov said. </p>
<p>The U.S. bank''s economists see a 50 percent chance that the
Fed will start tapering by December, an 80 percent chance by
January 2014 and a 100 percent chance by March 2014. </p>
<h2>Biggest Losers </h2>
<p>Emerging-market and commodity currencies will remain the
biggest losers as the dollar starts to advance, Marinov said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley predicts the dollar will advance to $1.25
per euro by the middle of next year, Morgan Stanley''s Stannard
said. The U.S. currency weakened 0.4 percent to $1.3584 per euro
at 5:58 p.m. London time after reaching $1.3607, the weakest
level since Feb. 4. The greenback depreciated 0.6 percent to
97.45 yen after touching 97.15, the weakest level since Aug. 28. </p>
<p>The dollar recovery has probably been delayed because
the decision to taper stimulus was pushed back, Stannard said.
While the policy is aimed at supporting growth and asset
prices, it will provide a positive environment for the dollar. </p>

success and excellence as a practicing lawyer; and she has been
an effective and caring mentor to lawyers of all generations,
Milone said in a statement. </p>
<p>McKeon, whose practice focuses on complex litigation,
including class and mass actions, and civil and regulatory
proceedings, began working at Morgan Lewis in Philadelphia in
1981. As head of the litigation practice, she oversaw its
expansion, particularly in London and Moscow, the firm said. </p>
<p>We will continue to focus on New York, Washington and
California in the U.S. and continue to focus on where our
clients need us internationally -- in financial markets, energy
dominated or IP, McKeon said in a phone interview yesterday.
We will continue that focus and growth in a deliberate way. </p>
<p>Under Milone''s leadership of the firm, which began in 1999,
Morgan Lewis added 13 of the firm''s 25 offices. The firm
strengthened its practices with a focus on energy, financial
services, technology, and life sciences mattes during this time. </p>
<p>McKeon, who had two children as an associate at Morgan
Lewis and two as a partner, said her rise to the top of
management was a reflection of the firm''s inclusive culture,
where issues of gender did not seem to get in the way. </p>
<p>Her position is the latest of several announcements of
women taking the helm. Yesterday, Kimberly Leach Johnson took
over as the head of Quarles  Brady LLP, becoming that firm''s
first chairwoman. Last October, Kim Koopersmith of Akin Gump
Strauss Hauer  Feld LLP was named chairwoman, also a first for
that firm. Other women leading firms include Valerie Ford Jacob
of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver  Jacobson LLP and Goodwin
Procter LLP chairman Regina Pisa. </p>
<p>Morgan Lewis has more than 1,600 legal professionals in 25
offices across the U.S., Europe, Asia and the Middle East. </p>

<h2>U.S. Seeks Delay of Civil Cases as Government Shutdown Begins </h2>
<p>U.S. Justice Department lawyers from New York to San
Francisco are asking judges to delay civil cases as the
government partially shuts down, and in Manhattan already won a
halt to litigation in all but one trial. </p>
<p>The Justice Department made the requests in prominent cases
including its bid to block the merger of US Airways Group Inc. (LCC)
and AMR Corp. in Washington and others including an antitrust
suit in San Francisco pressing Bazaarevoice Inc. to sell assets.
Federal attorneys are seeking delays in cases such as the
Depository Trust and Clearing Corp.''s suit against the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission over rules for swaps data. </p>
<p>The scope of delays sought by the Justice Department is
laid out on its website, which says criminal litigation will
continue without interruption while civil litigation will be
curtailed or postponed as much as possible without significantly
compromising the safety of human life or the protection of
property. </p>
<p>If a court denies a request to suspend case, the government
will continue to staff it, considering the judge''s order legal
authorization to continue with staffing at the minimum level,
Justice Department planners said. </p>
<p>While prosecutors say they have been immediately pinched by
the government shutdown, the federal court system can run for
about two weeks without furloughing staff by tapping into fees
from filings and other sources, according to a statement by U.S.
District Judge John Bates, who is director of the Administrative
Office of the U.S. Courts. Bates'' statement came before the
shutdown began. </p>
<p>Once those funds have been spent, the court system would
continue to handle most cases, according to Bates. </p>
<p>Federal judges would remain on the job, though it''s unclear
whether magistrate and bankruptcy judges would be paid until the
crisis is resolved and payments to jurors and court-appointed
criminal defense lawyers might be deferred, he wrote in his
statement. </p>

<h2>CFTC Enforcement Chief David Meister to Step Down This Month </h2>
<p>The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission''s David Meister, the enforcement chief who pursued investigations of MF
Global Holdings Ltd. and interest-rate manipulations, plans to
step down this month. </p>
<p>Gretchen Lowe, the enforcement division''s chief counsel,
will serve as acting director after he departs, the CFTC said
yesterday in a statement. Meister, who previously worked as a
federal prosecutor and attorney in private practice, hasn''t
announced other plans, said Steve Adamske, an agency spokesman. </p>
<p>The probe into manipulation of the London interbank offered
rate and other benchmarks was among the widest-ranging in CFTC
history. The agency began the investigation in 2008, and, on
Meister''s watch, was among regulators that reached more than
$2.5 billion in settlements with Barclays Plc (BARC), Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc, UBS AG and ICAP Plc. </p>
<p>David has brought energy, talent and experience to our
critical mission to protect the public from fraud and abuse and
ensure market integrity, CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler said in a
separate statement. He is a tough but fair former federal
prosecutor who will be missed by all at the CFTC. </p>
<p>Meister said in the release that the time had come to
return full time to his family in New York. He called Lowe a
gifted attorney with superior judgment, who has the respect of
the staff, and who is strongly committed to executing the
enforcement mission. </p>
<p>Under Meister''s watch, the CFTC also joined other
regulators in examining JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s $6.2 billion
trading loss in London last year. The regulator is looking into
whether the company manipulated trading in credit derivatives,
people familiar with the matter said last month. The agency
hasn''t yet brought claims in that case. </p>
<p>He was picked to run the CFTC division in November 2010
from the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher  Flom LLP,
where he was a partner specializing in white-collar criminal
cases. He previously was an assistant U.S. attorney in
Manhattan, serving on that office''s securities and commodities
fraud task force. </p>
<p>Skadden didn''t immediately respond to a request for comment
on whether he will return to the firm. </p>

<h2>Firm News </h2>
<h2>NFL Free-Agent Lawyer Set to Unlock $16 Billion in NCAA Athletes </h2>
<p>Jeff Kessler, a Winston  Strawn LLP attorney who helped
bring free agency to the National Football League, is about to
focus on the unpaid athletes who generate more than $16 billion
in college sports television contracts. </p>
<p>New York-based Winston  Strawn is starting what it
describes as the first college-focused division at a major law
firm to represent players, coaches, schools and conferences
against what Kessler, 59, described as the unbridled power and
influence of the National Collegiate Athletic Association. </p>
<p>The NCAA should stand up and take notice that Jeff is
involved, said Bob Lanza, a former National Basketball
Association players'' union general counsel who worked alongside
Kessler and is now a partner in O''Neill  Lanza, a professional
sports advisory firm. I can''t think of anybody more qualified
to start this type of department. </p>
<p>Ed O''Bannon, a former basketball All-American at UCLA who
is suing the NCAA over the use of his image in commercial
ventures, reacted to the news by saying: Wow! Jeff Kessler. </p>
<p>College athletes, past and present, are taking increasingly
vocal, visible and litigious steps against what they consider to
be unfair rules set by the NCAA, which doesn''t permit athletes
to be paid. The agency faces lawsuits by former players that
could seismically alter the sports landscape and, according to
Steve Berman, managing partner of the Seattle-based law firm
Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, dissolve the 107-year-old governing
body of college athletics. </p>
<p>What''s at stake is a lot of money -- and their
survival, said Berman, whose firm represents former University
of Nebraska quarterback Sam Keller in a class-action lawsuit
against the NCAA over the use of player likenesses in video
games and promotions. Sometimes it takes litigation to make
social change. </p>
<p>NCAA spokeswoman Stacey Osburn said in an e-mail that the
organization wouldn''t comment on Kessler or his firm''s entry
into college sports. </p>
<p>Winston''s college group will be run by partner David Greenspan and associate Tim Nevius, who joined the firm from the
NCAA, where he worked as an associate director of enforcement. </p>
<p>No one has an attorney like Tim, Greenspan said on a
conference call interview last week with Kessler and Nevius. </p>
<p>The 33-year-old Nevius said his work at the NCAA enables
him to know what the enforcement staff is targeting in their
investigations and what angle they take when looking at
violations. </p>

<h2>White  Case Opens Office in Kazakh Capital Astana </h2>
<p>White  Case LLP opened a second office in Kazakhstan, in
the capital Astana. The new office will be headed by Maxim
Telemtayev, the executive partner in the firm''s existing office
in Almaty. </p>
<p>The firm has been present in Kazakhstan for nearly 20
years since we launched our office in Almaty in 1995, White 
Case chairman Hugh Verrier said in a statement. This move
demonstrates our continuing commitment to our clients investing
in Kazakhstan and the international activities of our Kazakh
clients. </p>
<p>The firm said it expects about nine lawyers to be located
in Astana by the end of the year. Office head Telemtayev, who
handles mergers and acquisitions matters, has expertise in the
renewable energy, mining and metals and oil and gas industries,
according to his firm bio. Among his most recent legal work is
handling debt restructuring and subsequent acquisition of
Kazakhstan''s largest bank and an equity acquisition of a power
plant in Kazakhstan. </p>
<p>Kazakhstan''s business hub has been shifting steadily to
Astana ever since it became the country''s capital city, he
said in a statement. Establishing an office in Astana will
ensure we''re ideally positioned to support our clients
effectively while strengthening the platform from which the
ongoing development of our Kazakh practice will continue. </p>
<p>White  Case has lawyers in 40 offices in 27 countries. </p>
<h2>Dentons and McKenna Long in Talks to Merge, Firms Confirm </h2>
<p>Dentons LLP, the 2,600-lawyer global law firm formed by a
merger with Fraser Milner Casgrain, Salans and SNR Denton,
completed in March, is eyeing a new combination. The union could
be with McKenna Long  Aldridge LLP, which also recently
undertook a major combination. Last year the firm acquired
California law firm Luce Forward Hamilton  Scripps, giving the
firm more than 600 attorneys at 15 offices in the U.S., Brussels
and Seoul. </p>
<p>The two law firms both confirmed the talks in a statement
but declined to announce a partnership. Both made complimentary
statements about their potential merger partners. </p>
<p>Dentons said it''s interested in McKenna because of its
industry-leading government contracts practice, premier
insurance sector work, and enhanced California team from legacy
Luce Forward. </p>
<p>In a statement from McKenna confirming the discussions, the
firm said it was exploring possibilities for expansion with
several firms. Dentons, with 75 locations in more than 50
countries and a commitment to delivering creative, dynamic
business and legal solutions, is one such firm, according to
the statement. </p>
<h2>Moves </h2>
<h2>GE Litigator Noga Joins Jenner  Block''s New York Office </h2>
<p>Jenner  Block LLP said Joseph L. Noga has joined the firm
in the complex commercial litigation practice in New York. Noga

transactional disciplines. The firm has approximately 480
attorneys at offices in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and
Washington. </p>
<h2>Former WTO Deputy Director General Joins King  Spalding </h2>
<p>Alejandro Jara, former deputy director general of the World
Trade Organization, has joined King  Spalding LLP as senior
counsel in the WTO and international trade practice in the
Geneva office. </p>
<p>Jara was the deputy director general at the WTO since 2005.
He was Chile''s ambassador to the WTO from 2000 to 2005. </p>
<p>Alejandro''s substantial WTO expertise, his unique
experience in the global trading system and the broad scope of
his knowledge of trade and investment issues further strengths
our international trade team, Daniel Crosby, managing partner
of King  Spalding''s Geneva office said in a statement. </p>
<p>King  Spalding''s WTO and international trade practice has
more than 40 lawyers and trade professionals. The firm has 800
lawyers in 17 offices in the U.S., Europe, the Middle East and
Asia. </p>
<h2>Health Care and Employment Partners Join Epstein Becker </h2>
<p>Epstein Becker Green PC announced the addition of two new
lateral partners, both in Newark. Mollie O''Brien, former in-house counsel in the health care industry,joins the firm as a
member of the health care and life sciences practice. Jeremy M. Brown, formerly of Proskauer Rose LLP, joins the labor and
employment practice. </p>
<p>O''Brien previously served as a senior vice president, legal
affairs and general counsel at Emergency Medical Associates in
Parsippany, New Jersey, a group of 400 emergency medicine
providers. She was also general counsel and chief operating
officer of Superior Insurance Company, also in Parsippany. </p>
<p>Brown''s practice concentrates on complex employment
litigation, including discrimination, harassment, and
retaliation claims; whistle-blower claims; defamation, breach of
contract, and other matters. </p>
<p>Epstein Becker has approximately 275 lawyers in nine U.S.
offices. </p>
<h2>Bankruptcy </h2>
<h2>New York City Opera Lawyer Expects Bankruptcy Filing Today </h2>
<p>New York City Opera, created 70 years ago as the people''s
opera, expects to file for bankruptcy protection today and
either liquidate in court or be sold to another institution, its
lawyer, Kenneth Rosen of Lowenstein Sandler LLP, said. </p>
<p>The nonprofit organization, which this year produced Anna
Nicole, about the late tabloid celebrity, failed to reach its
fundraising goal of $7 million, Rosen said Sept. 30 in phone
interview. </p>
<p>There have been many, many generous donors -- a lot of
people appreciate what the New York City Opera does, and it does
a wonderful thing, said Rosen, who has worked with the opera
for two years. But right now we don''t have the $7 million that
we need to go forward with the season. </p>
<p>The opera company last week posted an urgent notice on
its website seeking donations to help raise $20 million,
including the $7 million it said it needed by Sept. 30 for the
current season. Just $291,952 was pledged by 2,027 people as of
Sept. 30 in an online Kickstarter campaign. </p>
<p>The opera has obviously been trying to avoid this,
Rosen said. Over the past several years, it has been doing
everything conceivable to reduce overhead, reduce expenses,
including moving from Lincoln Center to City Center. </p>
<p>George Steel, the artistic director and general manager
since 2009, wrote in a mass e-mail on Sept. 26 that the opera
is on the verge of canceling its season and filing for
bankruptcy. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) won''t be able to seek
a second import ban against some handsets made by Google Inc. (GOOG)''s
Motorola Mobility, though it can get damages under a ruling
issued by a U.S. appeals court today. </p>
<p>A U.S. trade agency was wrong to say some of Motorola
Mobility''s products didn''t infringe one Microsoft patent, while
there was no violation of three others, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington said in an opinion
posted on its website today. The remaining patent expires in
December, so there won''t be enough time for a trade agency to
block the devices from being imported into the U.S. </p>
<p>The ruling does give Microsoft ammunition to seek cash
damages from Motorola Mobility in a U.S. district court. Both
sides declared victory, with Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft
saying it bolsters its efforts to get royalties from devices
running on Google''s Android, the world''s most popular operating
system. Motorola Mobility is one of the biggest holdouts of a
program started three years ago, Microsoft has said. </p>
<p>We''re pleased the court determined Google unfairly uses
Microsoft technology and once again call on Google to join the
rest of the Android ecosystem in licensing our patents,
Microsoft Deputy General Counsel David Howard said. </p>
<p>Motorola Mobility, which was bought by Mountain View,
California-based Google after the case was filed in 2010,
focused on the findings regarding the other three patents and
the court finding that Motorola Mobility designed around the one
that was infringed. </p>
<p>Today''s favorable opinion confirms our position that our
products don''t infringe the Microsoft patents, said Matt Kallman, a Motorola Mobility spokesman. </p>
<h2>79 Percent </h2>
<p>Had Motorola Mobility lost on any of the three other
patents, it would have faced another possible import ban. as
each has at least three years left on their terms, according to
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office''s website. </p>
<p>The court didn''t rule on Google''s appeal of a separate
patent in the dispute before the U.S. International Trade
Commission. In that case, the ITC issued an import ban against
some Motorola Mobility phones. Microsoft has sued U.S. Customs
and Border Protection, claiming it hasn''t enforced the order. </p>
<p>Android had 79 percent of the global market in the second
quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Microsoft''s
operating system was third with 3.6 percent, with Apple Inc.
having 13.2 percent. </p>
<p>The patent claim that was revived against Motorola Mobility
involves a digital interface that presents relevant choices when
a user selects a computer resource, such as a picture file. </p>
<h2>ActiveSync Case </h2>
<p>The Federal Circuit said the ITC erred in its
interpretation of a key term in that patent. It sent the case
back to determine the type of infringement by the main group of
Motorola Mobility products and what, if any, the appropriate
remedy would be. Other devices that designed around the patent
were cleared of infringement by the appeals court. </p>
<p>The three-judge panel affirmed a finding that Motorola
Mobility doesn''t infringe a patent for synchronizing data. That
patent is similar to one involved in the infringement ruling
Google is appealing, relating to syncing calendar items between
mobile devices and computers. It involves Microsoft''s ActiveSync
software. </p>
<p>The court also upheld the ITC''s determination that
Microsoft hadn''t established that it was using the technology
covered by the other two patents, a requirement that''s unique to
the trade agency. The panel didn''t address the ITC''s finding
those patents weren''t infringed. </p>
<h2>Xbox Case </h2>
<p>A Motorola Mobility case against Microsoft, seeking to
block imports of the Xbox video-gaming system, failed at the ITC
and is on appeal. </p>
<p>In connection with that case, Microsoft has accused
Motorola Mobility of demanding unreasonable fees on fundamental
technology used in many electronics. Microsoft won a trial last
week on its claims that Motorola Mobility breached obligations
to license its standard-essential patents on fair terms. </p>
<p>The case that was ruled on is Microsoft Corp. v. ITC,
12-1445, while the pending case is Motorola Mobility LLC v. ITC,
12-1535, both U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
(Washington). The ITC case is In the Matter of Certain Mobile
Devices, Associated Software and Components Thereof, 337-744,
U.S. International Trade Commission (Washington). </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Ligand
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (LGND) won U.S. approval for a drug to treat hot
flashes and osteoporosis. </p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration cleared the drug, Duavee,
for moderate-to-severe hot flashes related to menopause in women
who haven''t had a hysterectomy, the agency said today in a
statement. The medicine, also approved to prevent post-menopausal osteoporosis, will be available in the first quarter
of 2014, Pfizer said today in a statement. </p>
<p>The medicine from Pfizer, the world''s biggest drugmaker,
will enter a market for hot-flash treatments that includes
Hisamitsu Pharmaceutical Co. (4530)''s Brisdelle. Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY)''s
Evista, which generated $1 billion in sales last year, was
approved in 1997 for prevention of post-menopausal osteoporosis.
Duavee is the first FDA approved medicine that combines estrogen
with a compound that selects certain tissues to work on. </p>
<p>Duavee contains the ingredient bazedoxifene that can act
like estrogen on bone to protect density combined with a mixture
of estrogens. Pfizer, based in New York, sells Premarin, which
generated $1 billion in sales last year and is derived from the
urine of pregnant horses. Premarin has six uses, including the
two Duavee will be labeled to treat. </p>
<p>Ligand rose 7 percent to $47.99 at the close in New York,
it''s biggest gain in more than three months. Pfizer fell less
than 1 percent to $28.77. </p>
<p>The most common side effects of Duavee in clinical trials
were muscle spasms, nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, among
others, the FDA said. </p>
<p>Ligand, based in La Jolla, California, formed a research
deal with Pfizer-acquired Wyeth, which developed the medicine.
The FDA rejected bazedoxifene in 2009, after multiple delays, as
an osteoporosis treatment on stroke and clotting concerns. </p>
<p>Duavee will have the same boxed warning as other estrogen
products, the FDA said. Premarin warns against an increased risk
of cancer of the uterus and of dementia. </p>

<p>Twin hurricanes that struck Mexico
last month are bolstering traders'' conviction that the central
bank will lower borrowing costs for a third time this year to
alleviate any damage to economic growth. </p>
<p>Interest-rate swaps yesterday indicated a 76 percent chance
that Mexico''s central bank will cut its benchmark rate by 0.25
percentage point in the next three months to 3.5 percent. That''s
the highest odds since the eve of policy makers'' half-point
reduction in March. Sixteen of 20 analysts in a Sept. 20 survey
by Citigroup Inc.''s Banamex unit predict at least one more cut
this year, versus just three who anticipated the quarter-point
reduction on Sept. 6. </p>
<p>Hurricanes Ingrid and Manuel left at least 157 people dead,
with flooding that decimated crops such as tomatoes and chili
peppers while disrupting deliveries and emptying hotels in
Acapulco. While the destruction may push up inflation as food
prices rise, it will pressure the central bank to cut borrowing
costs to bolster an economy already growing at the slowest pace
since 2009, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>The economy was already debilitated, and it was hammered
by this shock, Alberto Ramos, the chief Latin America
economist at Goldman Sachs in New York, said in a telephone
interview. It makes sense for the central bank to ease more
after this devastation. </p>
<h2>Easing Potential </h2>
<p>Before the hurricanes, Ramos expected the central bank to
lower its 3.75 percent rate by 0.25 percentage point on Oct. 25
to a record-low 3.5 percent. The storms opened the door to a
half-point cut this month or another reduction to 3.25 percent
in December, he said. President Enrique Pena Nieto said the
storms were the most intense on record. </p>
<p>Ricardo Medina Macias, a spokesman for Banco de Mexico,
didn''t respond to e-mail and voice messages seeking comment. </p>
<p>Manuel and Ingrid drove more than 50,000 people from their
homes and stranded 40,000 more in the resort city of Acapulco,
including tourists from Mexico City who were celebrating over
the country''s Independence Day holiday weekend. </p>
<p>While most Acapulco hotels were spared from damage,
occupancy rates have declined due to the closing of the highway
connecting the resort city to the nation''s capital, according to
Armando Uribe Valle, president of the Mexican Association of
Hotels and Motels. </p>
<h2>Vacant Rooms </h2>
<p>Acapulco''s 18,000 hotel rooms registered with the
association have been about 20 percent occupied in the weeks
since the storms hit, Uribe said. The dropoff already has cost
$19 million to $23 million in lost room charges, and demand
could remain below normal for as long as two months, he said. </p>
<p>I don''t remember it ever being this bad in terms of
occupancy, he said. </p>
<p>Three of the 14 highways nationwide that were closed by the
storms remain blocked, Communications and Transportation
Minister Gerardo Ruiz Esparza said at an event with Pena Nieto
on Oct. 1. The government is aiming to have the infrastructure
of Michoacan, a grower of produce including limes and one of the
states hardest hit by Manuel, restored within four months, Ruiz
Esparza said. </p>
<p>The central bank, led by Governor Agustin Carstens, cut the
key rate to 3.75 percent on Sept. 6, surprising 19 of 20
economists in a Bloomberg survey. </p>
<h2>Split Decision </h2>
<p>The central bank was split in its decision, with two
members voting to maintain rates and wait until the Federal
Reserve clarified its plan for $85 billion monthly stimulus
program that has fueled demand for emerging-market assets. </p>
<p>That was nine days before the storms hit, and the Fed on
Sept. 18 said it would refrain from paring the stimulus. </p>
<p>The Fed announcement strengthened the peso and increased
the chances for another rate cut, according to Credit Suisse
Group AG''s chief Mexico economist, Alonso Cervera. In a Sept. 26
report he cut his forecast for this year''s growth in gross
domestic product to 1.1 percent from 1.3 percent. </p>
<p>In the second quarter, the economy contracted by 0.7
percent from the prior three months, the first quarter-over-quarter drop since 2009. The third-quarter GDP report isn''t due
until November. </p>
<p>The hurricanes have increased downside risks to GDP,
wrote Cervera, who expects a quarter-point cut this month. </p>
<p>Although the destruction of crops may spur an increase in a
measure of inflation that includes farm and energy prices, we
do not think that the potential spike in agricultural prices
will have implications on monetary policy, Cervera said. </p>
<h2>Insurance Estimates </h2>
<p>The Mexican Association of Insurance Institutions estimated
last week that the hurricanes caused 75 billion pesos ($5.7
billion) in damage, of which 12 billion pesos to 15 billion
pesos will be covered by insurance. </p>
<p>The finance ministry said Sept. 27 that about 12.5 billion
pesos from an emergency fund have been made immediately
available for reconstruction and another 5 billion pesos from a
repavement fund will be directed toward storm recovery. The
government will also work with legislators to allocate more
spending from next year''s budget to rebuilding, the ministry
said. </p>
<p>CI Banco''s Jorge Gordillo says Mexico''s central bank will
keep borrowing costs unchanged because of concern the Fed will
start to unwind the stimulus at its meeting this month. </p>
<h2>Opposite Direction'' </h2>
<p>Banxico doesn''t want to be going in the opposite
direction of the Fed, Gordillo, CI Banco''s director of
economic analysis, said in a phone interview. </p>
<p>The extra yield investors demand to own Mexican government
dollar bonds instead of Treasuries fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 208 basis points at 4 p.m. in New York,
according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. </p>
<p>The cost to protect Mexican debt against non-payment for
five years with credit-default swaps rose one basis point to 121
basis points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the
underlying securities or the cash equivalent if a borrower fails
to adhere to its debt agreements. </p>
<p>The peso fell 0.5 percent to 13.1735 per dollar. </p>
<p>Benito Berber, a strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc.,
projects a quarter-point interest rate cut in October and says
there''s a 50 percent chance of another reduction in December. </p>
<p>If you would have distributed or spread out the impact
over 12 months, it of course would not push the central bank to
cut, Berber said in a telephone interview. Given that it''s
concentrated in a particular time when the economy was expected
to recover after a very disappointing first half of the year, I
think it will open the door for cuts. </p>

<p>Reserve Bank of India data showed the
highest ratio of short-term external debt to currency reserves
in more than a decade, raising alarm bells at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. and Nomura Holdings Inc. </p>
<p>The $97 billion maturing in less than a year amounted to
34.3 percent of reserves as of June 30, the highest since at
least March 2001, RBI figures released Sept. 30 show. The ratio
was 146.5 percent during a balance-of-payments crisis in March
1991, according to the report''s partial data for the 1990s.
Including longer-term debt, repayments due by June 2014 total
$170 billion, or 60 percent of reserves. Indonesia''s comparable
ratio is 55.8 percent. </p>
<p>Asia''s third-largest economy faces significant risk as
banks and companies seek to refinance global borrowings, even as
the government acts to trim the current-account deficit, Goldman
wrote in a Sept. 30 research note. Nomura said the slowest
economic growth in a decade and a budget deadlock in the U.S.
will damp inflows, further straining India''s finances. </p>
<p>We expect the focus to turn to India''s external
vulnerability amid a worsening global backdrop, Sonal Varma,
an economist at Nomura in Mumbai, said in an Oct. 1 telephone
interview. The worst in terms of the quarterly current-account
deficit is likely behind us. </p>
<p>The deficit in the broadest measure of trade was $21.8
billion in April through June, compared with $18.1 billion in
the previous quarter, the RBI said in a Sept. 30 statement. The
median of 26 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey was for a $23
billion gap. </p>
<h2>Deficit Outlook </h2>
<p>Nomura predicts the widest shortfall among the largest
emerging markets will narrow to 3 percent of gross domestic
product in the fiscal year through March 2014 from a record 4.8
percent the previous period. Goldman analysts Tushar Poddar in
Mumbai and Vishal Vaibhaw in Bangalore forecast a 3.5 percent
gap as tariff increases curb gold imports and slower growth
limits domestic demand. GDP increased 5 percent in the year
ended March 31, official data show, the least in a decade. </p>
<p>The current-account deficit will drop to 4 percent of GDP
this fiscal year, according to the median of 14 estimates in a
Bloomberg survey of economists. However, the shortfall in the
government''s budget will widen to 5.05 percent of GDP in the
same period, from 4.9 percent the prior year, according to the
median estimates in a separate survey, as Prime Minister
Manmohan Singh boosts spending ahead of elections due by May. </p>
<h2>Debt Outflows </h2>
<p>Global funds have cut holdings of Indian debt by $11.5
billion to $26.9 billion since May 22, when Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke first flagged a potential paring of
bond purchases. Since the Fed unexpectedly maintained its buying
on Sept. 18, the figure is down $891.5 million. Foreign reserves
fell to $277 billion in the week through Sept. 20 from $297
billion at the end of 2012, official data show. </p>
<p>India is one of the countries with the most challenging
macro imbalances, Goldman analysts including London-based
Thomas Stolper, wrote in a Sept. 30 note to clients. High-frequency data on Indian capital flows indicate that, even after
the dovish Fed surprise, the funding of the large Indian
external deficit remains a challenge. </p>
<p>Goldman is selling the rupee against the euro, betting it
will weaken to 92 per euro from 83.9678 today. The Indian
currency advanced 1.2 percent to 61.7400 per dollar today, and
the yield on the 10-year benchmark bond fell nine basis points,
or 0.09 percentage point, to 8.64 percent. Local markets were
shut yesterday for a public holiday. </p>
<h2>Fed Stimulus </h2>
<p>Societe Generale SA on Oct. 1 closed its sell-rupee trade,
saying global risk sentiment has improved after the Fed
decision. BNP Paribas SA recommends investors buy the rupee,
saying the partial shutdown of the U.S. government will likely
prolong stimulus and boost the amount of cash available in the
global banking system. </p>
<p>Given the fact that you''re going to see such a disruptive
end to the U.S. fiscal debate, the Fed may continue to feel that
they have to do the heavy lifting in terms of supporting
growth, Mirza Baig, Singapore-based head of foreign-exchange
and interest rate strategy at BNP Paribas, said in a Sept. 30
telephone interview. </p>
<p>Like Bernanke, new RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan will also be
under pressure to manage the economy with little help from the
government before next year''s elections, according to
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (SEBA), or SEB. </p>
<h2>Rajan Policy </h2>
<p>In his maiden policy review on Sept. 20, Rajan unexpectedly
raised the benchmark repurchase rate to 7.50 percent from 7.25
percent to curb inflation and counter outflows. He said taming
the fastest price increases among the largest emerging markets
is his top priority. </p>
<p>Standard  Poor''s last month reiterated it may downgrade
India''s debt rating to junk as fuel and food subsidies
threatened Prime Minister Singh goal of curbing the government''s
budget deficit. Credit-default swaps insuring the bonds of State
Bank of India (SBIN), a proxy for the sovereign, against non-payment
for five years have climbed 140 basis points from the year''s low
of 174 in May, according to data provider CMA. </p>
<p>At least until the elections are done, Rajan is pretty
much on his own, Sean Yokota, head of Asia strategy at SEB in
Singapore, said in a Sept. 30 telephone interview. Considering
India''s huge funding needs, I wouldn''t consider buying the rupee
until we have clarity on Fed tapering. </p>

<p>TCS Group Holding Plc, the owner of
Tinkoff Credit Systems Bank, announced plans for a $750 million
initial public offering in London, set to become this year''s
first Russian company to sell shares in the city. </p>
<p>TCS is poised to sell between $150 million and $200 million
in the form of global depositary receipts this quarter,
according to a statement today from the Russian consumer lender.
Chairman Oleg Tinkov, who owns of 61 percent of the bank, will
sell shares, along with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Baring Vostok
Capital Partners, Horizon Capital and Vostok Nafta, TCS Chief
Executive Officer Oliver Hughes said on a conference call. None
of the selling shareholders is exiting, he said. </p>
<p>Tinkov''s offering comes after Russian coal miner
Sibanthracite Plc (SIB) and railroad-freight carrier NTS Holding Plc
postponed London IPO plans this year. OAO Alrosa, the world''s
biggest diamond producer by output, plans to sell a 16 percent
stake in Moscow. TCS is seeking to benefit from Russia''s growing
consumer lending market, even as credit risk rises. </p>
<p>We''re very much an online company that enables investors
to tap into the Russian consumer, Hughes said today. We have
a very deep reach into Russia''s regions, there''s enormous
potential for growth. </p>
<h2>San Francisco </h2>
<p>Russia''s consumer-finance banks face an increase in bad
loans in the unsecured retail lending market, Moody''s Investors
Service Inc. said on Sept. 12, noting TCS among those with
heightened risks. Russian bank lending to households rose 34
percent earlier as of Aug. 1 from a year earlier, while
unsecured loans rose 39 percent, according to central bank data.
That is higher than the regulator deems comfortable. </p>
<p>The branchless bank of Tinkoff Credit is modeled on Capital
One Financial Corp. (COF) in the U.S., a pioneer of card distribution
via direct mail, which Tinkov said he encountered while living
in San Francisco. </p>
<p>Hughes said 85 percent of TCS customers live outside Moscow
and St. Petersburg, Russia''s two biggest cities. The bank had
issued more than 3.5 million credit cards by the end of June,
according to the statement. </p>
<p>TCS Bank''s net income in the first half of the year rose to
$79 million, compared with $52 million in the same period a year
earlier, it said. Total assets equaled $2.42 billion as of June
30, with consumer deposits at $977 million and loans to
customers at $1.95 billion, according to the statement. </p>
<h2>Investor Interest </h2>
<p>The London stock market is the front-runner for an IPO
because there isn''t enough liquidity in Moscow and reporting
rules are too stringent in the U.S., Tinkov said in an interview
last year. </p>
<p>I think Tinkoff''s IPO will trigger a lot of global
investor interest, Vadim Bit-Avragim, who helps manage about
$4.4 billion at Kapital Asset Management in Moscow, said by
phone. This business is closer to the consumer sector, it has
fast growth. Tinkov is a well-known businessman, he is very
active and his views are liked by the investment community. </p>
<p>TCS sees a wide investor base for the IPO, Hughes said,
declining to reveal if the lender has any anchor investors. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Sberbank CIB will be
managing the sale, while JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Renaissance
Capital will also be joint bookrunners, according to the
statement. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) mistakenly
added about $1.5 million of interest costs to a Ford Motor Co. (F)
bond sale last week by using the wrong Treasury note as a
benchmark for the security, according to two people with
knowledge of the transaction. </p>
<p>As compensation, Ford was charged a lower underwriting fee
for the offering of $1 billion of five-year, 2.875 percent notes
from its finance unit, said one of the people, who asked not to
be identified because the information is private. The automaker
paid 0.1 percentage point less in fees than in two previous
sales of similar-maturity debt, regulatory filings show. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the sixth-largest underwriter of corporate
bonds worldwide this year, took Ford public in 1956 and a former
executive at the bank, John Thornton, sits on the carmaker''s
board. Such an error by the New York-based bank is rare across
capital markets, said AllianceBernstein Holding LP (AB)''s Ashish Shah, who wasn''t involved in the sale. </p>
<p>I can''t recall the last time something like this
happened, said Shah, the head of global credit at New York-based AllianceBernstein, which manages $435 billion. It''s a
reminder that this is a human-led process, he said. It''s
probably something that won''t be repeated for a long time at the
firm. </p>

<p>Essent Group Ltd. (ESNT), the mortgage
insurer backed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and billionaire
George Soros, added Wells Fargo  Co., its largest customer, to
the group of underwriters for an initial public offering. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo, the biggest U.S. home lender, accounted for 17
percent of Essent''s sales in the first six months of this year,
according to a regulatory filing today from the Bermuda-based
insurer. The firm also added Bank of America Corp., the third-largest mortgage originator, as an underwriter. </p>
<p>Mortgage insurance, which covers losses when borrowers
default and foreclosures fail to recoup costs, is typically
selected by originators. Essent was founded amid the financial
crisis, when record homeowner defaults pushed some rivals from
the business. As home prices rise, firms that survived are
attracting investors looking for ways to bet on housing. </p>
<p>New capital would help fund Essent''s continued growth,
Helen Remeza, an analyst at Moody''s Investors Service, said in a
Sept. 23 research note. A capital raise could also further
differentiate Essent Guaranty from its more weakly capitalized
peers with legacy exposures. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo (WFC) is the only customer to account for more than
10 percent of Essent''s revenue, according to the filing. New
York-based Goldman Sachs is leading the offering, with JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM), the No. 2 mortgage lender, and Barclays Plc. </p>

<p>U.S. investment firms Lone Star
Funds, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Apollo Global Management LLC (APO)
are among the bidders for 25 Dublin properties being sold by
Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) as it exits Ireland, according to
people with knowledge of the sale. </p>
<p>Davy, Ireland''s largest securities firm, is also involved
in initial bids submitted before the Sept. 30 deadline, said two
of the people. All of the people declined to be identified
because the process is private. </p>
<p>Jones Lang LaSalle Inc., the broker managing the sale, is
seeking 140 million euros ($191 million) for a portfolio called
Ulysses that includes the Justice Ministry''s headquarters as
well as office buildings, stores and apartments. </p>
<p>Ireland''s real estate market, led by Dublin, is emerging
from the biggest slump in western Europe. Income returns from
office buildings in the capital are more than 10.5 percent a
year, the highest among cities covered by research firm
Investment Property Databank Ltd. </p>
<p>Representatives for Goldman, Lone Star, Apollo and Jones
Lang declined to comment on the sale. Emile Abu-Shakra, a
spokesman for Lloyds, declined to comment in an e-mail. Davy is
advising an overseas institutional investor on the sale,
according to one of the people. A representative for the firm
also declined to comment on the sale. </p>
<p>Most of the Ulysses properties previously belonged to Liam
Carroll, one of the country''s biggest developers during its
real-estate bubble, who has seen many of his properties seized
by banks. </p>
<p>Lloyds decided three years ago to close the Irish unit it
acquired as part of its 2008 takeover of HBOS Plc and sell or
run off the assets. The bank has taken 12.5 billion pounds ($20
billion) of impairment charges on Irish loans since the nation''s
real-estate market collapsed in 2008, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg News. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. won''t be able to seek
another import ban against some handsets made by Google Inc. (GOOG)''s
Motorola Mobility, though it can get damages under a ruling
issued by a U.S. appeals court yesterday. </p>
<p>A U.S. trade agency was wrong to say some of Motorola
Mobility''s products didn''t infringe one Microsoft patent, while
there was no violation of three others, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington said in an opinion
posted on its website yesterday. The remaining patent expires in
December, so there won''t be enough time for a trade agency to
block the devices from being imported into the U.S. </p>
<p>The ruling does give Microsoft ammunition to seek cash
damages from Motorola Mobility in a U.S. district court. Both
sides declared victory, with Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft
saying it bolsters its efforts to get royalties from devices
running on Google''s Android, the world''s most popular operating
system. Motorola Mobility is one of the biggest holdouts of a
program started three years ago, Microsoft has said. </p>
<p>We''re pleased the court determined Google unfairly uses
Microsoft technology and once again call on Google to join the
rest of the Android ecosystem in licensing our patents,
Microsoft Deputy General Counsel David Howard said. </p>
<p>Motorola Mobility, which was bought by Mountain View,
California-based Google after the case was filed in 2010,
focused on the findings regarding the other three patents and
the court finding that Motorola Mobility designed around the one
that was infringed. </p>
<p>The favorable opinion confirms our position that our
products don''t infringe the Microsoft patents, said Matt
Kallman, a Motorola Mobility spokesman. </p>
<p>The court didn''t rule on Google''s appeal of a separate
patent in the dispute before the U.S. International Trade
Commission. In that case, the ITC issued an import ban against
some Motorola Mobility phones. Microsoft has sued U.S. Customs
and Border Protection, claiming it hasn''t enforced the order. </p>
<p>The case that was ruled on is Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) v. ITC,
12-1445, while the pending case is Motorola Mobility LLC v. ITC,
12-1535, both U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
(Washington). The ITC case is In the Matter of Certain Mobile
Devices, Associated Software and Components Thereof, 337-744,
U.S. International Trade Commission (Washington). </p>
<h2>SmartMetric Loses Patent Ruling in Visa, MasterCard Case </h2>
<p>Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) don''t infringe a patent owned
by SmartMetric Inc., a company that had sought as much as $13.4
billion for alleged use of its technology in smart debit and
credit cards. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Michael W. Fitzgerald in Los Angeles,
affirmed his earlier tentative decision from a Sept. 25 hearing. </p>
<p>The parties here are comparing apples and oranges, the
judge said in an Oct. 2 written ruling. The piecemeal
similarities that SmartMetric has identified in support of its
claims do not change the fact that claims 1 and 14 of the 464
patent are simply not practiced by defendants, and no reasonable
jury could conclude otherwise.'''' </p>
<p>SmartMetric sued Visa and MasterCard two years ago,
claiming they infringed its patent for a system for automatic
connection to a network. The company claimed it was entitled to
a royalty of 25 percent of the anticipated savings Visa and
MasterCard would receive from a drop in credit and debit-card
fraud by the introduction of so-called EMV cards in the U.S. </p>
<p>The EMV cards, which are already used in Europe, include a
microchip instead of a magnetic strip to access a payment
system. The SmartMetric patent pertains to the process by which
the payment system selects a network for a card transaction,
Patrick Bright, the company''s lawyer, said at the Sept. 25
hearing. </p>
<p>SmartMetric said in a statement yesterday it will appeal
the non-infringement ruling. </p>
<p>The case is SmartMetric Inc. (SMME) v. MasterCard International
Inc., 11-cv-07126, U.S. District Court, Central District of
California (Los Angeles). </p>

<h2>Amazon Seeks Firetube'' U.S. Trademarks for Variety of Uses </h2>
<p>Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), the world''s largest e-commerce company,
applied to register the term Firetube as a trademark,
according to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. </p>
<p>The application, filed Sept. 25, indicates that the
Seattle-based company plans to use the mark for a wide range of
services, including online social-networking, a mobile software
application, and the dissemination of advertising via the
Internet and other communications networks. </p>
<p>Other uses for the mark, Amazon says, are the provision of
non-downloadable pre-recorded content via wireless networks,

<h2>Kentucky Restaurant Successful in Defense of Derby Pie'' Mark </h2>
<p>Kern''s Kitchen Inc., a Kentucky restaurant that''s been in
business for more than 50 years, won a trademark battle against
a restaurant that was started by the founder of the Kentucky
Fried Chicken chain. </p>
<p>The dispute was over a pie that is associated with the
Kentucky Derby horse race. According to the database of the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office, Louisville, Kentucky-based Kern''s
Kitchen began using the name Derby Pie in 1964, and
registered it as a U.S. trademark in October 1969. </p>
<p>The company said on its website that the pie, which has
chocolate chips and walnuts among its ingredients, is a secret
recipe and no one has ever been able to duplicate our special
filling and delicate crust. </p>
<p>That hasn''t stopped many people from trying. A Google
search for the terms Derby Pie and Recipe yields more
than 48,000 hits. Kern''s Kitchen has successfully filed other
trademark suits related to the pie''s name. </p>
<p>Kern''s Kitchen objected to the use of the term derby
pie to describe a dessert served at Claudia Sanders Dinner
Houses Inc., of Shelbyville, Kentucky, and filed an infringement
suit in federal court in March. </p>
<p>According to the Dinner Houses website, the restaurant was
founded in 1968 by Harland Sanders, and originally known as
The Colonel''s Lady. Sanders sold his Kentucky Fried Chicken
company to a group of investors in 1964, and the chain is now a
unit of Yum! Brands Inc. (YUM) He and his wife Claudia, inspired by
their knowledge of Southern Recipes and their natural leaning
toward the restaurant, then opened The Colonel''s Lady. </p>
<p>Sanders died in 1980 at the age of 94, and his widow died
in 1996, at the same age. </p>
<p>In its complaint, Kern''s Kitchen said that it renewed its
trademark in 2009 and didn''t authorize the mark''s use by the
defendant. It asked the court for an order barring further
infringement and damages of $335,000 together with awards of
attorney fees and litigation costs. </p>
<p>On Oct. 1 a federal court in Frankfort, Kentucky, issued an
order permanently barring Dinner Houses'' use of Derby Pie,
and dismissing all other claims. The court said each party must
pay its own attorney fees and litigation costs. </p>
<p>Dinner Houses'' menu lists a dessert containing chocolate
chips and pecans that is now named Claudia''s Kentucky Pie. </p>
<p>The case is Kern''s Kitchen Inc. v. Claudia Sanders Dinner
Houses Inc., 3:13-cv-00013-GFVT, U.S. District Court, Eastern
District of Kentucky (Frankfort). </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. is talking to HTC
Corp. (2498) about adding its Windows operating system to HTC''s
Android-based smartphones at little or no cost, people with
knowledge of the matter said, evidence of the software maker''s
struggle to gain ground in the mobile market. </p>
<p>Terry Myerson, head of Microsoft''s operating systems unit,
asked HTC last month to load Windows Phone as a second option on
handsets with Google Inc. (GOOG)''s rival software, said the people, who
asked not to be identified because the talks are private.
Myerson discussed cutting or eliminating the license fee to make
the idea more attractive, the people said. The talks are
preliminary and no decision has been made, two people said. </p>
<p>Its willingness to add Windows as a second operating
system underscores the lengths to which Microsoft will go to get
manufacturers to carry its software. HTC, the first company to
make both Windows and Android phones, hasn''t unveiled a new
Windows-based handset since June and has no current plans to
release any more, said one person. Microsoft, with 3.7 percent
of the market, is finding it necessary to make concessions after
agreeing to acquire Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)''s handset unit, which competes
with other smartphone makers. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon stepped down as chairman of the lender''s
main bank subsidiary at the start of July, according to a person
briefed on the move. </p>
<p>Dimon, who serves as CEO and chairman of the parent
company, handed off his post at the unit to William C. Weldon, a
JPMorgan board member and former head of Johnson  Johnson (JNJ), said
the person, who asked not to be named because details of the
move weren''t announced. A regulatory document released yesterday
listed Dimon as chairman emeritus of the subsidiary, which
runs JPMorgan''s deposit and consumer banking operations. </p>
<p>JPMorgan has sought to bolster corporate governance and
rebuild its relationship with watchdogs after probes by
regulators and a Senate panel faulted the firm for withholding
information from U.S. overseers during trading losses last year.
Dimon handed off the chairman title at the unit after company
attorneys recommended it for technical reasons, rather than
because of pressure from regulators or investors, said the
person, who''s familiar with the bank''s thinking. </p>
<p>Joe Evangelisti, a company spokesman, declined to comment.
Dimon''s status as chairman emeritus at the unit was disclosed in
JPMorgan''s annual living will, describing to regulators how
the New York-based firm could be wound down in an emergency. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX) began returning workers
to shuttered Gulf of Mexico operations and Anadarko Petroleum
Corp. said it expected to follow suit as Tropical Storm Karen
weakened off Louisiana. </p>
<p>San Ramon, Calif.-based Chevron, which produces oil and gas
from the Tahiti and Blind Faith fields and has a stake in the
Perdido development, said on its website at 1 p.m. Eastern time
today that it would be resuming normal operations. It didn''t say
how long that would would take. </p>
<p>The storm doesn''t seem to be as significant as was once
thought, but we''re still monitoring the situation, Vincent
Piazza, a Princeton, New Jersey-based oil production analyst for
Bloomberg Industries, said today. </p>
<p>He said it was unclear how long the disruptions would last. </p>
<p>Anadarko (APC), based in The Woodlands, Texas, halted production
and cleared employees from the Independence Hub and the Neptune,
Constitution and Marco Polo platforms. Workers on the latter two
may return later today, John Christiansen, a spokesman at
Anadarko''s headquarters, said by e-mail. </p>
<p>Other companies with Gulf operations, including London-based BP Plc (BP/), the largest leaseholder in the deepwater there,
kept energy production offline. Those producers and refiners
planned to remobilize as conditions allowed. </p>
<p>Almost 62 percent of Gulf oil production, some 866,000
barrels of oil per day, and 48 percent of natural gas output, or
1.8 billion cubic feet daily, was offline today, according to
the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. </p>
<h2>BP Operations </h2>
<p>BP secured wells being drilled by rigs it operates in the
Gulf. The company also halted production at all four of its
platforms there -- Thunder Horse, Atlantis, Na Kika and Mad Dog
-- and evacuated non-essential workers. Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)
cut rates at Louisiana and Alabama plants. BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP),
Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO) and the Williams Cos. (WMB) were
also among the companies curbing energy output. </p>
<p>The storm, with top winds holding at 40 mph (60kph), was
130 miles south-southwest of Morgan City, Louisiana, as of 2
p.m. New York time and had stalled, the National Hurricane
Center said in an advisory. Karen would be downgraded to a
tropical depression if sustained winds drop below 39 mph, which
the National Hurricane Center said will probably occur tomorrow. </p>
<p>Energy markets expect the storm to be kind of a blip,
resulting in short-lived supply disruptions, Dave Hackett,
president of consulting firm Stillwater Associates, in Irvine,
California, said yesterday. </p>
<h2>Lessons Learned'' </h2>
<p>There were a lot of lessons learned from Hurricane
Katrina and subsequent storms, he said. A big tropical storm
is wet, but don''t think it''ll do any serious damage. </p>
<p>Gasoline futures for November delivery slid 3.2 cents, or
1.2 percent, to $2.6076 a gallon yesterday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, the lowest settlement since December. Oil
gained 0.5 percent, and natural gas rose 0.2 percent. </p>
<p>Shell cut rates at its 85,000-barrel-a-day plant in Mobile,
Alabama, and Motiva Enterprises LLC reduced output at the
250,000-barrel-a-day Norco, Louisiana, refinery because of
shipment delays caused by Karen, Shell said on its website
yesterday. Motiva is a joint venture of Shell and Saudi Aramco. </p>
<p>Shell, based in The Hague, also was removing some
nonessential personnel from drilling operations in the eastern
Gulf, the company said on its website. </p>
<p>Valero Energy Corp. (VLO), Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC), Chevron and
other refinery operators said they were monitoring the storm and
hadn''t cut production. </p>
<h2>Four Platforms </h2>
<p>London-based BP''s four deepwater platforms have a combined
capacity to produce 660,000 barrels of oil and 990 million cubic
feet of natural gas a day, according to BP''s website. </p>
<p>Marathon halted output and evacuated all workers from its
Ewing Bank platform 130 miles south of New Orleans, the Houston-based company said on its website. The company said it shut in a
total of 18,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. </p>
<p>Melbourne, Australia-based BHP ceased production and
evacuated its Gulf of Mexico facilities, Jaryl Strong, a
spokesman for the company, said by e-mail yesterday. Williams
shut and evacuated the Canyon Station, Devils Tower and Blind
Faith platforms in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, the company said
on its website yesterday. </p>
<p>Destin Pipeline LLC, which can transport 1.2 billion cubic
feet of gas a day from the Gulf, declared force majeure Oct. 3,
saying in a notice to shippers that it''s incapable of providing
services from its offshore receipt points because of the storm. </p>
<p>Enbridge Inc. (ENB)''s Manta Ray and Mississippi Canyon gas
pipeline systems in the Gulf also declared force majeure. </p>
<p>LOOP LLC, the only U.S. port capable of offloading ultra-large crude carriers, suspended tanker operations, the
Covington, Louisiana-based company said in a statement on its
website. </p>
